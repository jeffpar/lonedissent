NS. OEERIYs

Thank you, Nr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Respondents are three individual consumers who
want to buy reconstituted milk, which is milk made from

10

powder and water and occasionally blended with a portion

11

of fresh milk, at a price below the price they would pay

12

for the price of regular fresh milk.

13

Their complaint is that federal milk market

14

orders issued under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement

15

Act make it uneconomical for milk handlers to

16

manufacture the product they want, and so they're

17

attacking the federal orders.

18

The issue for this Court is whether ultimate

19

consumers of milk products are proper parties to

20

challenge the minimum wholesale prices that milk

21

handlers are required to pay to farmers.

22

When this suit was first filed,

the three

23

individual consumers were joined by a milk handler and a

24

nutrit ion organization as cc-plaintiffs.

25

court dismissed the entire case, holding that both the
3

The district

1

organization and the consumers lacked standing, and that

2

the handler had failed to exhaust his administrative

3

remedies under the Agricultural Marketing

4

Agreement Act.

The ccurt cf appeals affirmed the dismissal of

5

the handler and the nutrition organization, but it held

6

that the consumers had standing and remanded the case

7

for a trial on the merits.
The milk market order program, as this Ccurt

8

9

has recognized in a number cf prior cases, is

10

extraordinarily complex, arid sc I will try to limit my

11

description of it to just a layman’s description cf

12

those previsions of the program that affect the issues

13

in this case.

14

Probably the most important aspect of milk

15

market orders is the classified pricing system embodied

16

in those orders, and that system has always been a

17

feature of the dairy industry, even before orders came

18

into being in the early 1930s.

19

Milk — under this system, milk that’s used

20

for drinking purposes commands a higher price, known as

21

Class I.

22

such as cheese or milk powder sells at a lower Class II

23

or Class III price.

24
25

Milk that’s made into manufactured products

The statute requires handlers, who are
essentially middlemen, to pay farmers according to the
4

1

end use to which the raw milk is put.

2

if a handler buys milk and sells it for drinking

3

purposes, he pays Class I prices for it.

4

same raw milk and makes it into cheese and sells it as

5

cheese, then he pays Class II or Class III lower prices

6

for it.

In other words,

If he buys the

But to protect farmers against destructive

7
8

competition for sales in the desirable fluid market, the

9

handlers* payments are pooled, and farmers get paid a

10

uniform blend price regardless of the use to which the

11

milk of an individual farmer is put.
To maintain the integrity of this classified

12
13

pricing system, the Secretary of Agriculture regulates,

14

and has since 1964, reconstituted fluid milk as if it

15

were a

16

buys powder, then turns around and reconstitutes it into

17

fluid milk, he pays for the powder or the raw milk that

18

he uses to make the powder at Class I prices.

19

uses the powder to make ice cream or seme ether

20

nondrinking purpose, then he pays for it as a Class II

21

or a Class III product.

22

Class I product.

In other words, if a handler

If he

23

handlers pay for raw milk at the class — the lowest

24

Class III price, even if the handlers turn around and

25

make the powder into fluid milk that competes directly
E

1

with fresh milk for fluid sales.

2

moment, we think that Respondents are precluded from

3

litigating what's basically a handlers' grievance about

4

the prices that handlers pay.

5

As I'll discuss in a

First the Court should consider that this

6

lawsuit as a factual matter really makes very little

7

sense.

QUESTION;

Ns. Oberly, in that connection why

was the handler dismissed?
MS. OBERLY;

Justice Blackmun, the statute, as

11

I'll explain, has a specific and detailed review

12

procedures -- procedure for handlers whc wish to

13

challenge a milk market order.

14

procedure is under 608c(15)(A) of the statute.

15

608c(15)(A) requires a handler to file a petition for

16

review with the Secretary, and the Secretary then holds

17

a formal adjudicatory, on the record hearing, reaches a

18

decision on the handler’s petition, and if the handler

19

is dissatisfied, the handler is then afforded a right of

20

judicial review in district court.

21
22
23

The first step in that
7 U.S.C.

The handler in this case did not and has net
to this date filed such a petition.
Factually, we are at somewhat of a less to

24

understand the sense of this case.

25

Respondents' complaint, ‘even though they phrased
6

As best we can tell,
it in

1

terms cf price, is simply a matter cf convenience.

2

operate in consumers’ favor.

5

The

Eut consumers could save more than that by

6

between the product that a manufacturer would sell and

There’s no nutritional difference

10

11

12

consumer would make at home; and there’s no real

In the past and in the allegations in this

13

complaint, consumers allege that they prefer the test of

14

manufacturer-reconstituted milk because it has a

15

butter fat content; but the record in this case, the

16

Agriculture Department's impact statement of

17

Respondents' proposal, demonstrates that it’s possible

18

to make a product at home that’s virtually

19

indistinguishable in taste from the product that these

20

Respondents want to buy in a store by simply blending

21

powdered milk and water and some portion of fresh milk.

22

So in our view this case dees come down to a

23

consumer interest in convenience.

They would rather be

24

able to buy the product in the store for slightly mere

25

money than they could

-- than it would cost to make them
7

1

at home.

2

Cur position as a matter of law is that

3

Congress never intended to permit consumer attacks cn

4

market orders, but that it certainly didn’t intend to

5

let consumers upset such a delicate regulatory scheme

6

for convenience.

Respondents contend that they're entitled to

20

maintain this suit under the APA, but the APA has its

21

23

24

Marketing Agreement Act.

Here, of

That statute, as I mentioned a

ago, sets up a special scheme for handlers tc get

plan for handler review.

4

This Court has never permitted the APA to he

6

get greater rights to review than the parties that

7

Congress has specifically provided for in the statute.

8

But that would he the effect of allowing consumer suits

9

attacking market orders to be brought under the APA.
The basic problem with Respondents' lawsuit,

10
11

as we see it, is that they're attempting to litigate

1-2

someone else's rights -- handlers’ rights.

13

really isn't about the prices that consumers pay fcr

14

milk or milk products; it's about the order prices that

15

handlers pay to farmers.

Wouldn't a handler normally be a

And ycu then have

2

handlers litigating as consumers, but not in the way

3

that Congress has specified handlers are to bring these

4

claims to the Secretary's and the court’s attention.
Our basic position is that when Congress has

5

6

said how it wants a statute to be enforced, and here

7

it's said how handlers are to enforce these provisions,

8

then there’s nc rocit fcr ether parties who are complete

9

strangers to the regulatory scheme to come in and

10

litigate someone else’s rights and liabilities.
We really think it’s quite inconceivable that

11
12

Congress could have intended tc let consumers litigate

13

handlers' rights.

11

it's really no more farfetched than Respondents'

12

monetary stake in this lawsuit.
The market orders regulating commodities such

13
14

as lemons don't control prices directly like the milk

15

market orders do, but instead they do -- they dc it by

16

controlling the quantity of a product like lemons that

17

can be brought to market each week.

18

At the beginning cf the season a lemon

19

advisory committee makes recommendations to the

20

Secretary of Agriculture about how many lemons should be

21

marketed each week, but during the course of the season,

22

the lemon committee locks at the results cf the previous

23

week's marketing efforts and decides whether to

recommend changes.

to bring their grievances to the Secretary first, we

When Mr.

Cberweiss, the handler who was

dismissed from the case, is cut there and able to do

25

that Congress intended, it doesn't make any sense to
16

1

assume that Congress would have allowed strangers tc

2

come in and litigate the same issue but not go through

3

the procedures specified in the statute.

4

One other difference, Justice White, between

5

consumers and producers is that basically the market

6

orders are government-ordered contracts between handlers

7

and producers; and it would be quite unfair and perhaps

8

even unconstitutional to say that one party to the

9

contract, the handler, can sue, but the other party to

10

the contract, whose personal proprietary rights are

11

affected, can't sue because Congress didn't mention them.
The same thing is not true of consumers.

12

The

13

consumers are not parties tc these minimum wholesale

14

price contracts between producers and consumers.

15

They're suing on somebody else's rights, and we think

that's a substantial difference.

And as for the zone of interest problem with

this case, there basically are three or four or even

more different factors that would all have to coalesce

in Respondents' favor before there could be any

The first is that Respondents live in Florida,

10

19

the business of marketing reconstituted milk.

20

example, the impact statement in this case notes that

21

the entire State of California is unregulated by federal

22

market orders, and yet there's still no reconstituted

7

His action obviously had

Even if Respondents could find a handler who

8

wanted to market reconstituted milk in their area, they

9

are unable to show that the handlers' cost savings would

10

be passed on to consumers.

The legislative history

11

indicates that when farm prices increase, consumers do

12

see that at the retail level; but when farm prices

13

decrease, as would be the case here, handlers frequently

14

keep a substantial portion of the savings for themselves

15

rather than passing it on tc the consumers.

16

Another point is the Department of

17

Agriculture's impact statements show that this plan of

18

Respondents would cost farmers far mere than it would

19

save consumers — a difference of several hundred

20

million dollars of savings tc consumers, on the one

21

hand, and a loss in farmers' income on the other.

22

It's net very likely that farmers or their

23

representatives in Congress would allow that to happen.

24

It's almost certain that farmers would press for an

25

increase in the price support program that would wipe
19

1

out any savings to consumers by raisinq the prices that

2

they have to pay for manufactured dairy products.

3

Respondents also ignore the fact that even now

4

with these supposedly prohibitive federal regulations in

5

place,

7

8

were changed, it's a likely assumption that more states

OR AI ARGUMENT OF RONALD L. PLESSER, ESQ.,
CN BEHAIF OF THF RESPONDENTS
MR. PLESSER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

1

In this case three cost-conscious consumers of

2

milk frcm Tampa Bay, central Arkansas and Texas are

3

seeking to challenge regulations of the Secretary cf

4

Agriculture which effectively prohibit the sale to them

5

of reconstituted milk -- a lower cost alternative tc

6

fresh fluid milk.
The Government in their argument continued to

7

8

misstate, I think, the interest of consumers in this

9

case.

I believe counsel said that we are challenging

10

the minimal -- minimum price level that handlers must

11

pay to producers for fresh fluid milk.

12

all the claim of consumers in this case.

That is not at

The claim of consumers in this case is that

13
14

the Secretary of Agriculture has issued a set cf

15

regulations which prohibit the marketing of an

16

alternative product in contravention cf the regulation,

17

of the statute which is the Agriculture Marketing

18

Agreement Act.

19

are challenging whether or not a competitive product

20

should

We are not challenging price levels; we

be able to be marketed.
There is only one issue in this case at this

21

22

point.

The Government is arguing a good deal of the

23

merits, tut the real issue at this point is whether or

24

not these three consumers have access to the courts to

25

challenge certain milk market regulations by the
21

1

Secret ary.

2

The consumers* claims are asserted under

3

Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act as

4

persons aggrieved by regulations under the Agriculture

Marketing Agreement Act.

The Government contends that they are

precluded by inference and

MB. PLESSEE:

Well, Your Honor, I think what
24

1

on the merits of this case what we hope is that

2

essentially the — the reconstituted milk process will

be taken out of part of the regulation and will be

4

treated as a milk product rather than milk so that its

5

price will be able to float in the marketplace and net

6

necessarily be regulated.
QUESTIONt

7

Mr. Plesser, you're talking new, I

8

guess, about kind of questions of fact involving

9

standing.

You say one thing; the Government says

10

another thing.

11

in the court of appeals, the majority opinion there,

12

devotes some attention.

13

And I notice that Judge Wilkie's opinion

How are these kind of factual questions

14

resolved at the pleading stage?

15

simply to take your allegations?

16

of factual inquiry?

17

Is the Court required
Can it make some sort

What is the test?

MR. PLESSERi

Well, I think the test was

18

enunciated in the Sarth v. Seldin which indicated that

19

you could -- that the Court could take the allegations,

20

but if those allegations were challenged by the

21

Government, that it then -- then the plaintiffs had a

22

requirement to substantiate those -- those allegations.

23

Sc I don't think

I can just sit here and say

24

allegations are enough to get us past the barrier cf --

25

of injury in fact and redressability.
25

But I think the

1

-- what we've produced in the record, which by the way

2

is primarily material developed by governmental agencies

3

in this case, indicate that we have -- we have met the

4

threshold requirement for injury in fact, redressability.

11

issues of merits at the standing level.

12

Judge Wilkie in the court of appeals thought that that

13

was inappropriate, but did f*eel that there was a need

14

for this threshold of seme facts.

15

not just standing on the bare allegations in our

16

com plaint.

17

And at least

And we're certainly

We were turned down -- consumers were turned

18

down in their petition to the Secretary of Agriculture,

19

and I think it's important to, as I go into the injury

20

and preclusion issues, to -- to just review the three

21

basic requirements for this kind of case were set down

22

in Associated Data Processing and Barlow v. Collins.

23

And those three requirements are that injury in fact by

24

the government agency, that the interests asserted are

25

within the zone of interest of a substantive statute,
26

i-

1

and that the statute cannot explicitly cr implicitly

2

preclude judicial review.

3

As I've already stated, of course, we don’t

4

have to demonstrate merits.

5

6

We just have to demonstrate

The injury being suffered by these consumers

7

is distinct, palpable and is personal to them.

The

Government has argued as though we are representing

9

consumers from all over the country and that it is £9

10

cents per capita per year, cr what we are arguing is for

11

three particular consumers in regions of the country,

12

where the Secretary’s own impact statement indicated

13

that they would be benefited if reconstituted milk was

14

made a vailable.

15

These are in regions which are typically

16

referred to as inefficient milk market regions.

17

be that in the more efficient regions consumers would

18

not be able to demonstrate the injury that our clients

19

can demonstrate in this case.

20

It may

We are not representing all consumers in the

21

United States.

We are representing three consumers who

22

are located in three specific market areas, and we’ve

23

demonstrated facts in cur case -- in cur papers

24

sufficient to indicate an injury to them if -- an injury

25

don't contest it -- at the same price cr higher price

As we've demonstrated on page 5 cf our brief, in

And I think it is

10

that consumers would buy reconstituted milk.

11

only buy it if it was at a cost savings.

12

They would

And in those three areas not only does the

13

regulations cf the Secretary make them equal price, tut

14

in fact, reconstituted milk is more expensive.

15

that's net been contested at any point by the Government.

And

And I think it is also important tc focus both

16
17

on the Secretary of Agriculture’s impact statement that

18

indicated that consumers would be damaged tc the extent

19

of $186 million a year, or in ether words, they would

20

receive a benefit cf $186 million a year.

21

contend that for purposes of standing that that is a

salient factor.

MR. PLESSER:

we have to argue or we have to contend is that if we

So while I understand your question, I think

that our -- that our concerns are -- it’s very confusing

19

and it's very close, but I think we're — we’re more

20

interested in getting that product available rather than

21

arguing the price.

indicates that there’s an interest in -- in this fair

MB. PLESSERs

as I stated,

2

I think you are -- I assume -- I will take judicial

3

notice that you're all consumers of milk, but I think

4

that -- I think that what we're arguing here is what

5

area of the country, what would the impact on those milk

6

market orders are.

7

■

Your Honor, as I

We've done the analysis of the Washington

8

metropolitan area.

9

kind of impact in this area that — that would -- that

I dc not know if there would be the

10

we've done for our consumers in the Tampa Bay, Arkansas

11

and Texas area, that would -- would justify consumers.

12

I think -- but I think what you're getting at

13

is the generalized grievance argument, Justice

14

Marshall.

15

Judge Wilkie had a good response to that, which is if we

16

can demonstrate that our -- that there is a distinct and

17

palpable injury, my clients cannot go to a supermarket

18

and find reconstituted milk on the shelf, and studies

19

indicate that but for these regulations there's a

20

substantial probability that that product would be there.

21

And I think that — I think that Judge --

We can't find it on the shelf.

That's a real

22

injury.

23

then can demonstrate that we are within the zone of

24

interest of the statute for a fair and balanced program,

25

and that is, I think, the basis of cur claim.

That's a real loss.

We then have — I think we

34

*

The fact that many other consumers are like

1
2

situate I don’t think lessens the impact or the rights

3

of cur clients to seek redress.

4

Finally is the preclusion argument that we

5

have recognized and which the Government relies on quite

6

strongly, and I think the preclusion argument of the

7

Government is really very simple.

8

-- since handlers were giver specific remedial rights

9

under the statute, that no one else should be able to

It says that anybody

10

challenge the statute.

Kcnhandlers are excluded.

Cf

11

course, that argument was rejected by this Court in

12

in Stark v. Wickard, where it was determined that

13

producers, although not given specific administrative

14

and judicial rights, were allowed standing.

1944

The Government has argued well, producers

15
16

really is a different situation because they are more

17

affected by the statute, they’re more recognized as the

18

principal beneficiary, none cf which we -- we contest or

19

argue with.
Gur claim simply -- and our position is very

20

21

straightforward.

For the position -- for an argument of

22

preclusion, if nonhandlers are to be precluded and if it

23

was the intent of Congress to preclude nonhandlers, then

24

producers and consumers are indistinguishable for that

25

purpose.

They may be cn much different grounds fcr

We've looked at the briefs in that case, and

9

we believe

the Supreme Court, this Court in Stark v.

10

responded tc that argument, as we quote in cur material,

11

and suggested that -- that those types of arguments of

12

the delicate balance and the excessive litigation would

13

be solved by motions to dismiss and other activities

14

that limit frivolous actions, as well as the cost of

15

brining the action.
And I -- I think that -- that this Court in

16
17

responding in 1944 to those exact same concerns can

18

raise the same -- the same responses are valid today;

19

that -- that there is no great fear that -- that

2

before I conclude.

3

indica ted -- used twc examples, the State of Califcrnia

4

and the State -- and North Carolina to indicate why

5

there really isn't any interest in marketing

6

reconstituted milk.

Cne, counsel for the Government has

My response to North Carolina is the reason

7
8

and it's in the record, I think in the impact statement

9

of the Secretary -- the reason that the -- that the —

10

the handler in North Carolina stopped making

11

reconstituted milk, which was relatively successful —

12

it wasn't overwhelming, but they were selling a fair

13

amount of it -- was because the handler was bought by a

14

co-op.

15

it was not in the interest of the co-op after they

16

purchased this handler to continue the reconstituted

17

milk product, and that's why the North Carolina

18

experience, which was a truly deregulated situation, did

19

not — did net result in -- why that ended.

The co-op is a milk producer, and I suggest that

In California it is true that California is

20
21

program.

I am

comfortable in asserting that the same type of

didn't stop them, state law did.

So while federal law

is even prohibited from being marketed, I assume

11

primarily for economic reasons.

12

It

It is a product that will benefit consumers,

13

and we believe — we contend that the Government -- that

14

consumers have asserted sufficient interest for standing.

NS. OBERLY:

No, net prebabiy to your

it is an adequate answer to say that if they're really

How do you make it?
You can do it any number of

ways.

I've experimented the last several days at heme.

together in equal proportions, and you wind up with a

We don't find that interest in the

As Justice O'Conner pointed cut, the purpose

of the statute is to raise producer prices.

Congress

9

has told the Secretary exactly the level tc which he is

10

to raise producer prices.

That's the parity level.

11

Respondents don't contend that the Secretary has

12

exceeded that level.

13

Respondents are asking the courts to define this fair

14

and balanced relationship between producers and

15

consumers when Congress itself has already said

relationship it wants to promote is increased farm

prices, and it had net the slightest interest in
