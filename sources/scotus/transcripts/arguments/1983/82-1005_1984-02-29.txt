The regulation addresses the question of what

12

counts as a "source" for purposes of activating a permit

The Conference Committee removed that.

14

look to that history, and we say there seems tc have

MR. BATOR:

Your Honor, our position is that

5

even if the definition applies, the most sensible

6

reading of it is that within the definition there is

7

8

intended some administrative discretion to adapt it to

the functional needs of the various Clean Air Act

An illustration of that would be, there is

still another program enacted in 1977.

14

in areas of the country which had attained rational

standards.

16

that the bubble definition, even though using the same

17

language as in the Section

adaptation used the buttle definition.

19

in that context, the Court of Appeals upheld it saying

that there is discretion tc adapt the definition tc meet

what appears to roe to have

teen dene here is that EFA has defined source for

3

purposes of 75C3 in Part D two different ways.

given a tread scope definition for purposes of

structuring the bubble for emissions control, and then

6

it’s ignored the word source and referred to emissions

units for purposes of engaging lowest achievable

emission rate.

It's

Sc really EFA has defined source two different

ways,

it seems to me, within the same section for new

And would you explain that to me?

I believe not in dispute between respondents and us.

They way this works, that is the reason there are

significance levels in this situation is because the

That itself is defined as --

QUESTION;

Well, that's defined, but I think

11

the section does say any increase in pollution engages

review under new source review, and I just wondered how

we then by regulation get tc "significant levels."

14

Well, as I say, it comes in in a

15

number of different ways.

16

that if you are building something that is less than 1C0

17

tons per year, that it's net a major source at all; and

under either definition there is no new source review.

deciding that it needed to be strengthened by creating

It is not credible to suggest that when

for getting to the standards on time.

And that

situation is the construction moratorium situation, and

two situations.

Ecth of these apply in situations where the

state either has not yet written the plan, or is overdue

15

it’s okay tc use a definition which lets SO percent of

18

they may increase pollution, and in spite of the fact

19

that they're net even being huilt with lowest achievable

built all at the same time into a group that together

19

emitted more than the threshold amount of pollution, and

then subject that group to new source review.

had done that by adopting a definition that included the

QUESTION;

It required that different --

I mean, required, not authorized.

MR. EONIGER*

10

I believe it requires that --

What it requires is that if you

11

are building a bunch of small units at the same time, or

12

you’re adding a small unit, one that is net by itself

13

large enough to qualify as a major source -- i.e., by

14

itself it’s not a

15

ERA can subject that thing to new source review is by

virtue of making it a modification of the whole plant.

the only way it is subject to new source review

then you ought to -- then the symmetry cf it is

If that unit by itself is major in size, it

24

does emit more than 1CC tons, or in the case cf that

25

other program it’s a higher level of 25C tons, tut if

1

those thresholds are crossed, that thing, that boiler is

2

subject to review all cn its own, regardless of whether

3

it's located on a greenfield site or in a plant.

4

But even if Alabama Power is rightly

5

interpreted as mandating a plantwide definition for the

6

program to limit how much worse pollution can get where

7

it's currently better than the standards, it is net

8

consistent with the purpose of reducing pollution to let

9

sources which it applies in this program, to let these

10

tig projects escape from all the pollution reducing

11

requirements that are found in Section

12

173.

So to the extent the distinction means that

13

when the program is to reduce pollution it's net legal

14

to let these sources out of it, it’s right.

15

extent that the distinction is used to say that even in

16

a pollution increasing program like part (C) you don’t

17

need the unit definition, I think that that’s a

18

misinterpretation of the opinion.

19

QUESTION:

To the

Well, your central position, then,

20

if I understand you, is that if you need say three

21

smaller units to be aggregated into one plant to qualify

22

as a source, you just have to be consistent in treating

23

that the same way.

MR. DCNIGEE:

MR. DONIGER*

That’s correct.

I see.
I want to return to the

modernization argument for a moment, which I had started

10

on.

11

sometimes in a few cases you will find that a project is

12

delayed a little bit, which if it were allowed tc be

13

built

even with poor controls, would be cleaner than the

14

thing

that it's replacing, and that this justifies

15

changing the definition.

EPA’s position is that — or argument is that

What ERA has failed to do, though, is lock at

17

That’s right.

This is a case just like MVMA v. State Farm

22

has some discretion -- is defective because it only

24

considers a small fragment of the problem before it.

The difficulty

here is that we, the government, simply doesn't

thing going on here, which is that Congress meant that

KB. BATOF;

I don’t think, if that’s all he

was saying, that it makes any difference.

But we think

10

the most fundamental point here is that Congress was

11

trying to balance a number of different problems.

12

It found the

'70 statute tc be deficient

13

because it did not sufficiently balance the problem cf

14

renewal and growth with the problem of achieving

15

attainment.

16

So everything that Kr. Doniger says about the fact that

different path.

If you

2

can reduce pollution by spending a million dollars cn

machine A, that is a better idea than requiring you to

spend two million dollars cn having the same reduction

by making you do it on machine B.
If I have a machine that is a very efficient

machine and I want to double its capacity and that will

create 200 new tons of pollution, it may cost a million

It's what Congress mandated.
MR. DONIGER;

And Mr. Doniger comes here and

he says that Congress, by positive law, has eliminated

the administrator's discretion.

artificial explanations of why Congress said one thing

that they intended to change the statutory definition
