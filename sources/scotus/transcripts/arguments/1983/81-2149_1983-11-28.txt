CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

3

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK V. MEIERHENRY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. MEIERHENRY:

5

6

Mr. Attorney General.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:.
This case comes to the Court from the Eighth

7

8

Circuit Court of Appeals.

The Eighth Circuit Court of

9

Appeals, under the case of Edward versus Arizona, in a

10

case collaterally attacking the conviction of Mr. Stumes,

11

reversed the District Court.
The question presented to this Court is whether

12

13

Edward versus Arizona will be applied retroactively to the

14

case of Mr. Stumes when that attack was made by a habeas

15

corpus relief.

16

The facts essentially on this case is in 1973

17

Norman Stumes killed a young lady in Sioux Falls, South

18

Dakota.

19

later he was arrested in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on other

20

charges that had been pending, not on what were originally

21

filed as murder charges, but on perjury charges and other

22

charges at that time.

23

This occurred on September 17, 1973.

Ten days

During the time that the authorities were

24

seeking him for questioning concerning the death of Miss

25

Hoff, his mother hired an attorney for him.

And, his

1

attorney had a conversation with the law enforcement

2

officers in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and that lawyer

3

advised the law enforcement officers that if he got a hold

4

of Mr. Stumes first, he would tell him to turn himself in

5

for questioning.

6

found him first and arrested him first, that they would

7

not question him until the attorney, Mr. Jorgensen, was

8

notified, and that was done.

9

On the other hand, if the authorities

Mr. Jorgensen was notified some time on the 27th

10

of October 1973 — or the 27th of September 1973 that Mr.

11

Stumes had been arrested over in Green Bay.

12

then, either on the 28th or the 29th of September in 1973,

13

called Norman Stumes and told him not to talk to anybody

14

until he was brought back to South Dakota, to exercise his

15

right to speak with no one.

16

Mr. Jorgensen

Upon being arrested by the Green Bay

17

authorities, he was given his Miranda rights which were

18

required in 1973 and he made no statements at that time.

19

Later on two police officers, as well as a

20

deputy sherrif from South Dakota, went to Green Bay to

21

transport him back and they arrived there on October 1st.

22

They met with Mr. Stumes in Wisconsin, Brown

23

County, Wisconsin jail at which time Mr. Stumes gave them

24

voluntary permission to search where he had been arrested,

25

the place where he had been arrested and his automobile.

1

He was also given Miranda warnings at that time

2

by the South Dakota authorities and a conversation ensued

3

for about an hour and 45 minutes of which nothing

4

incriminating came out of that.

5

Later that afternoon there was another

6

conversation between the Defendant and the authorities.

7

He was not given his Miranda rights.

8

And, the only, as found by the District Court, the only

9

true incriminating thing is that he admitted that he had

The record is clear.

10

intercourse with the dead girl on the day in question and

11

he also, in answer to a question posed to him, was this

12

death accidental, he answered that it was.

13

Of course, he was going to be brought back to

14

South Dakota on these other charges, not the murder

15

charges, and so on October 2nd, they proceeded to get an

16

in automobile and drive the 500 miles from Green Bay,

17

Wisconsin, back to Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

18

When they got in the car, he was once again

19

given his Miranda warnings.

21

or 30 minutes.

And, a conversation about the

about 6:45 in the evening.

But, about 90 miles from Sioux Falls, Norman

1

2

Stumes, and I will take his words, said — Norman Stumes,

3

in testifying at various hearings, said, "I had a little

4

conflict with my emotions," and he began to sob and he

5

made the statement to the effect, I don't understand why

6

anybody would want to kill a young girl like Joyce.

7

Detective Green, an officer of the State of South Dakota,

8

said, Norman, it probably — Why don't you get it off your

9

chest, at which time he made admissions that implicated

10

And,

him and were used against him at his trial.

11

And, Stumes also said at that time, according to

12

Detective Green, that I have been wanting to tell somebody

13

about this but I didn't know how to do it or who to talk

14

to.
This conversation took place approximately 90

15
16

miles from Sioux Falls, and although the record is not

17

clear, about 5:00 in the afternoon.
Throughout that time, from 9:00 to 9:30,

18
19

throughout the day, Norman Stumes himself says he was not

20

interrogated, that there was general conversation about

21

the Green Bay Packers, automobile racing, and other such

things.

1

The only one from the prior day

of October 1st in the afternoon was he admitted that he

had intercourse and when asked the question, what kind of

4

death was this, was it accidental?

accidental.

in general that X have alluded to in the automobile at

7

approximately 5:00, based on driving times in the

8

afternoon, and then the one back at the jail after he had

9

been lodged into jail on these other charges.

11

That was admitted as well as the conversation

QUESTION:

10

He said it was

What is your defense of the

statements made the day before?
MR. MEIERHENRY:

12

Well, first of all, it is two

13

parts.

First of all, this Court will should agree, I

14

guess you would say, to apply the retroactive effect.

15

QUESTION:

Right.

16

MR. MEIERHENRY:

I don't think we get to that

17

unless this Court decides to apply Edwards retroactively,

18

which, of course, we would say this is like Miranda and

19

the many other cases this Court has not applied

20

retroactively, shouldn't be applied retroactively, because

21

the Court has indicated to those of us whose duty it is to

22

educate the law enforcement officers — At least in my

23

state it falls upon the Attorney General, and when this

24

Court makes a rule like Edwards, a new rule, one that we

25

were not used to, certain things go into operation.

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

As

1

the

Attorney General, my duty is to train all the law

2

enforcement officers as well as to supervise prosecutors.
So, when this Court — Within days after this

3
4

Court makes a new rule like Edwards, we immediately send

5

out in police parlance, you might say, what can occur and

6

what cannot occur throughout our state and that is done on

7

almost an emergency basis, because there is no reason to

8

start a case and not follow the proper procedures.
So, with that in mind, we have to decide whether

9
10

this case should be retroactively applied as the Eighth

11

Circuit did, and, of course, as indicated in the Palteire

12

case, this is not an appropriate type of case for

13

retroactive effect.

14

truth-binding portion of the trial.

15

if we follow what the Eighth Circuit has said, and we go

16

back and retry Norman Stumes, the truthful statements that

17

he made to law enforcement officers will be suppressed by

18

the exclusionary rule, whereas, those matters found to be

19

untruthful, his version of what happened that day, and his

20

attempt, testifying under oath before a jury to escape the

21

culpability that he had admitted to prior, will be allowed

22

in.

23

It does not assist in any way the
As a matter of fact,

In other words, we will have decided a case,

24

apply the exclusionary rule retroactively, take the truth

25

out of the case, and leave the Defendant —

QUESTION:

1

But, if he takes the stand and

2

testifies the way he did, wouldn't some of the statements

3

that might be excluded initially under Miranda and Edwards

4

be admissible on cross examination?

5

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Yes, Justice, but I can't

6

imagine a competent defense attorney would ever put him on

7

the stand.

8

wouldn't occur.

I mean, from a practical viewpoint, it

QUESTION:

0

But then his statements in the new

10

trial, his testimony wouldn't be presented any more than

11

the adverse testimony.
MR. MEIERHENRY:

12

That is right.

And, of course,

13

if you look at this case, and I will not make any

14

admissions as to what would occur later except that we are

15

obviously committed to reprosecute if the Eighth Circuit

10

is confirmed, but this is ten years ago.

the first.

Officer Green is

There is obviously a different approach as to the

The removing of his admissions and confessions

21

in most of these types of cases where the admission or

22

confession occurred early on effectively denies the public

23

the right to have a trial on this issue.

24
25

First of all, it was not the law in 1973, when
Norman Stumes went to trial, and when the Circuit Judge of

11

Court of the state.

3

case over, we do not have at this time the resources to

4

keep ten years of evidence for every criminal case tried

5

in the State of South Dakota, which the Eighth Circuit

6

seems to be saying to us that we must do.

7

case there is a retroactive application of a case like

8

Edwards.

in our state to keep the evidence of each and every case

So having had that direct part of the

We must wait in

with the chance that it could be applied retroactively,

11

because the state most certainly does not want Norman

for the vicious killing that he really has made any claim

throughout the appeal that he didn't do.

17

reason in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

18

It isn't a

The question is whether we make a retroactive

19

application of the exclusionary rule which this Court has

20

said in different decisions is a rule to prevent, to deter

21

those of us in law enforcement in the future, but in this

22

case it will most certainly not do that.

23

The day Edwards was decided and we got word in

24

the State of South Dakota, law enforcement changed.

25

did it on an emergency basis, because the Edwards case —

12
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 80001 (808) 688-0300

We

QUESTION:

1

May I ask, would you tell me exactly

2

what you did differently after Edwards than what you

3

thought was required before?
MR. MEIERHENRY:

4

Well, the way we put it out to

5

our prosecutors and our law enforcement officers is in the

6

context that it basically added another element of proof

7

to any case where someone confesses or makes admissions.

8

And, I know — I am going to answer your question not

9

according to what the Court has described it, but the way

10

we described it to the cop on the street that has to do

11

this the day after your decision in Edwards.
We said it is like another element of proof.

12

It

13

has totally changed the way we did it under Miranda.

14

Therefore, it is up to us to prove that the individual,

15

once he has made a claim to remain silent or for a lawyer,

16

we have to be able to prove that not only did he waive

17

that right, that he did so willingly and he came to you.
So, what we told our officers is that is a very

18
19

important — We can't even get to trial or we will never

20

be able to use it unless you can prove that it was a

21

knowing, willing situation.
QUESTION:

22

What did you tell your officers

23

before Edwards when a person being interrogated asked for

24

a lawyer?

25

at that time?

What were the outstanding orders to the police

MR. MEIERHENRY:

1

We told them, just as the

2

District Court Judge, Judge Nichol found in this case, to

3

scrupulously observe, as was done in this case, that if he

4

wants to talk to a lawyer, you cease questioning and give

6

him an opportunity to do so.
And, on two occasions in this very case, that

6
7

was done.
QUESTION:

8
9

Did you have a rule on whether you

could start reinterrogation after any specific —
MR. MEIERHENRY:

10

The State of South Dakota did

11

not.

We were not aware that this Court or any other

12

federal court said that you can never talk to a criminal

13

defendant again.
QUESTION:

14

Well, it says — I mean, the passage

15

of Miranda they quote, until they had consulted with a

16

lawyer.

17

MR. MEIERHENRY:

18

QUESTION:

Well, first —

Wasn't that plain in Miranda, that

19

you weren't suppose to talk to him a second time until he

20

talked to a lawyer in the interval?

21

MR. MEIERHENRY:

22

right to exercise.

23

exercise that right.

QUESTION:

MR. MEIERHENRY:

It is no longer.

Was it before Edwards?
Well, it wasn't my office, but

6

the policy was —■ I was a defense lawyer at that time —

7

that if he was given his Miranda warnings, he knew them,

8

he understood them, and he chose to speak, he could do

9

that.

10

He said, I don't want to talk any more —
QUESTION:

that, but Miranda —
QUESTION:

9

I thought you just said that.

MR. MEIERHENRY:

10

Miranda teaches that —When you

11

say go back over and over, there is the illusion that

12

there is an oppressiveness about this whole conversation

13

and I would submit from the standpoint of every state in

14

the union that if an individual says he doesn't want to

talk, he should not be pressured into talking.

MR. MEIERHENRY:

the facts of this case, and I think Judge Nichol, who is a

good jurist in our state, he found that that is not

predecessor will, eight or ten years, not arguing about

20

the guilt, not arguing about the trial being fair, arguing

21

about who initiated the statements that lead to the

22

confession.

23

We think that this case is just like — not just

24

like, very similar to Oregon versus Bradshaw in the sense

25

that in that case a majority of this Court held that first

we have to see who initiated the conversation and then,

2

secondly, we have to show by a totality of the

3

circumstances that it was a willing and knowing waiver.
In this case, the Defendant himself says I

4
5

wasn't being interrogated, there was just some

6

conversation.

7

during the conversation that is so crucial, he said I had

8

to tell somebody, I had to get it out, and I wanted to

9

talk.

10

Then he said, and this was immediately —

And, I see nothing in the Constitution that

11

prevents an individaul from confessing to a law

enforcement officer.

13

the law was at that time, under Miranda — Judge Nichol

14

ruled under Miranda all of this was proper, all of this

15

was admissible.

16

and I think it is important to note the times, Judge

17

Nichol refers to the oral argument reported in Law Week of

18

the Edwards case, but it was decided after Judge Nichol

19

made his ruling at the District Court level and obviously

20

the Eighth Circuit used it in making their decision.

21

That is what happened here.

And, as

The only thing that the Eighth Circuit,

But, the Eighth Circuit, in applying the

retroactivity, never had a discussion of how in this case

it would ever help the truth-finding process to make it

It is the same argument we made to this Court,

Now, if we — I will assume for my argument that

And, under the facts, should you hold this to be

retroactive, which we most certainly don't think is a

proper case at all for retroactivity, even under the

facts, the Eighth- Circuit was incorrect in holding that he

did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to have

subject matters that they had discussed the prior day and

11

he was given his Miranda warnings.

12

14

QUESTION:

But, he made no incriminating

statements during that 20 minutes?
MR. MEIERHENRY:

No, none greater than he had

the prior afternoon when he admitted to having intercourse

with the dead girl and that the death was acidental.

QUESTION:

18

MR. MEIERHENRY:

That he was present.
That he was present, yes, which

is obviously an incriminating element.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY J. MC GREEVY, ESQ.

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16
17
18

MR. MC GREEVY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to start out, first of all,

19

spending a few minutes going over the facts.

20

in some respects the facts have not been stated as I would

21

like to have them stated at this point.

22

I think that

I think it is important to bear in mind that

23

while this case originated in 1973, the Miranda decision

24

of this Court was, of course, handed down seven years, a

25

full seven years prior to the facts that give rise to this

case.
And, I think that we need to bear in mind that

3

while the ten years and two months that Mr. Stumes has

4

been in prison is a long time, the 17 years since Miranda

5

is even longer.

6

We have.a situation in this case where on

7

September 17, 1973, the body of the victim is found.

My

8

client, Norman Stumes, is located in Green Bay, Wisconsin,

9

ten days later.

So, it is not a situation where a suspect

10

is found immediately following an alleged crime and

11

immediately confesses, thereby making further independent

12

investigation by the authorities seem pointless.

13

was a period of time.

14

There

The fact of the matter is that by the time these

15

detectives got to Green Bay to question and transport

16

Norm Stumes, they already knew they had a murder case.

17

They had a pathologist who indicated that the cause of

18

death and the other circumstances of death were such as to

19

make it a homicide case.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Well, they knew they had a murder

case as soon as they found the body, didn't they?
MR. MC GREEVY:

Well, I suppose one could say,

23

Mr. Chief Justice, that just by looking at the body you

24

couldn't necessarily tell that it was a felonious or a

25

criminal act.

But, by the time —

MR. MC GREEVY:

4

QUESTION:

5

That is correct.

So, I don't get the point of this ten

days that you are talking about.
MR. MC GREEVY:

6

My point is that during the

7

course of the ten days the authorities took hair samples

8

from the victim, from the body of the victim, and from the

9

apartment, from the shower of the apartment, from other

10

areas of the apartment.

They attempted to take, I

11

believe, fingerprints.

12

body of the victim.

13

attempt to establish their case and to put their case

14

together.

They took blood samples from the

So they did a lot of things to

MR. MC GREEVY:

15

My point then was that by the

16

time they went to Green Bay they had a prime suspect and

17

that appears in the record, I believe, quite clearly.
They also knew, of course, that Norm's

18
19

20

mother —

Yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, you lose me.

The point is, of

21

course, they wouldn't go five or six hundred miles if they

22

didn't think they were going to fetch a suspect.

23

MR. MC GREEVY:

Well, I understood the Attorney

24

General to argue that in cases where you have a confession

25

that is secured very quickly, and I believe he inferred

28
ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST 8T„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that occurred here, the police, in effect, have a

2

disincentive to put together a case that is based on other

3

than a confession.

4

think, is the situation here.

5

QUESTION:

I was pointing out that that, I don't

Do you contend that the statements

6

made when they were 60 to 90 miles away from Sioux Falls,

7

as it was described and is described in the record, that

you challenge that?
MR. MC GREEVY:

10
11

of those statements?
QUESTION:

12

13

Do I challenge the admissibility

Yes.

Do you challenge that it

occurred first?
MR. MC GREEVY:

14

I must say that Mr. Stumes at

15

trial testified that it never happened, that that is part

16

of the record made at the trial.
For the purposes of this appeal and for the

17
18

purposes of the session here today, I think we have to

19

assume the allegations of the police to have been true.

20

It is —
QUESTION:

21

The jury verdict would suggest that

22

they rejected his testimony and believed the officers,

does it not?

correct.

1

I think that before we get to that conversation

2

in the car, Mr. Chief Justice, I think we need to back up

3

to the first session of interrogation.

4

that took place from around 9:30 in the morning to

5

about 11:00 in the morning in the jail in Green Bay,

6

Wisconsin.

7

a single officer, Green, Detective Green, as Mr.

Meierhenry has indicated is now deceased.

interrogation was preceded by full explanation of Miranda

That is the one

rights.
During that interrogation, Norm indicated that,

11
12

yes, he knew the victim, but, no, he had not been to the

13

victim's residence, he had not been in the victim's

14

bedroom, he had not had intercourse with the victim.

15

Towards the end of that session, Detective Green

16

indicates that he wants to know whether Norm is willing to

17

take a polygraph to clear himself as so many others had

done.

that he needed to talk to Steve before he answered that

QUESTION:

Mr. McGreevy?

10

MR. MC GREEVY:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

To take just a hypothetical case,

12

kind of based on the circumstances that you have been

13

describing, supposing that you have a defendant in custody

14

like your friend, Norm, as you refer to him, and he is

15

being interrogated by the police and there have been no

16

Miranda violations up to that time, and then he is asked

17

by one of the police will you take a polygraph test to

18

clear yourself and he replies, before answering the

19

question about the polygraph test, I would like to talk to

20

my attorney.

21

talk any more about the polygraph test, let's talk about

22

where you were at the scene of the crime.

23

any sort of a violation by that question?

And, the police then say, okay, we won't

Miranda, I think that that is a violation.

Miranda is mostly dicta, isn't it?

MR. MC GREEVY:

Not the way I view it, I guess.

Do you think all of those facts were

presented to the case by the situation of the Arizona

No, I am sure that is not the

8

QUESTION:

Then isn't it dicta?

9

MR. MC GREEVY:

Perhaps in a technical sense it

10

is, but I think that it expressed the opinion of the court

11

at the time the decision was handed down.

12

That is true of all dicta, isn't it?

MR. MC GREEVY:

14

I wanted to get to the point of the second

analysis.

After this first interrogation of an hour and 45

minutes where we have denials, denials, denials, ending

19

with two requests to talk to Steve, the detectives leave

That is not before us though, is it?
No, but I think that it provides

7

the linchpin to explain what happened the next day, Mr.

8

Chief Justice, in my view.
During that interrogation, according to the

9
10

testimony of the officers, they got Mr. Stumes to admit

11

that he had lied in the morning.

12

to their testimony, to admit that, yes, I had been there

13

at the time in question, yes, I had been in the bedroom,

14

yes, yes, we had had intercourse, and then at the end,

15

again, without the benefit of Miranda, they asked the

question — Green asked the question, was it accidental or

17

intentional and to that Stumes replies accidental,

according to the testimony.

They got him, according

I think the record does

show that the detectives started the long trip with fresh

19

Miranda warnings, that they immediately interrogated, and

20

that the record indicates that the interrogation continued

21

intermittently during the long trip.

22

But, it is true, I don't believe, anything in

23

the record that indicates that there was an outstanding

24

question regarding the interrogation at the time that Mr.

25

Stumes made that —

MR. MC GREEVY:
QUESTION:

I don't believe so.

Sixty to 90 miles away from Sioux

Why not?
MR. MC .GREEVY:
QUESTION:

Well —

The jury rejected his testimony on it

and accepted the police testimony on it and that is
consistent with all of the independent fact findings of
the District Judge?
MR. MC GREEVY:

The approach that we take on

this case, of course, is that the jury ought not to have
known of the — I will use your terminology — the
spontaneous declaration that was made as the neared
Sioux Falls, because, of course, it is our theory of this
case that had it not been for the repeated efforts by the
police to interrogate absent counsel, and if it had not
been for the authorities'

interrogation the afternoon

before without even benefit of Miranda, that we would
never have reached the point where we could have this
spontaneous declaration, again, to use your terms, Mr.
Chief Justice, occur.
So, we really fashion an argument, I think, that
builds one step at a time to reach that final conclusion.

But, Mr. McGreevy, that is basically

a factual conclusion, isn't it, whether something that had

described as a spontaneous statement?

particular issue if there are any findings?

9

another.
MR. MC GREEVY:

10

What are the

We shouldn't

I can see the problem that you

11

would have with that.

Insofar as whether either of the

12

courts below made findings on that specific issue, I don't

13

think directly that I can recall — the District Court, as

14

I indicated, found the interrogation in the afternoon to

15

have violated the principles of Miranda, but had, for

16

reasons that I never have been able to understand, held

17

that that was harmless.
I have to analogize or contrast that, I should

18
19

say, to what the Eighth Circuit did when they looked at

20

this case.

21

interrogation in the automobile, but they also looked at

22

the statements attributed to Mr. Stumes upon arriving at

23

the jail in Sioux Falls.

MR. MC GREEVY:

The point I was trying to make then, Justice

Okay.

13

Rehnquist, was that just as the Eighth Circuit saw that

14

final incriminating statement as having flowed from the

15

interrogation in the car, I think it is reasonable to

16

presume that —

17

QUESTION:

When you say "interrogation in the

18

car," my impression — One can easily be confused by this

19

record — was that the only interrogation in the car took

20

place the first half hour or so of the trip; that the

21

spontaneous remarks 90 miles east of Sioux Falls were not

22

the result of interrogation.

23

Are you saying that the Eighth Circuit found the

statement in Sioux Falls as a result of interrogation

early in the morning?

1

MR. MC GREEVY:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. MC GREEVY:

That is the key.

Did Miranda hold that?
I think Miranda — My whole

4

theory has been that we need never get to Edwards because

5

Miranda says when counsel is requested, the police

6

officers must stop questioning.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MC GREEVY:

9

Yes.
They even went on in Miranda to

explain what the alternatives are that are available to

10

the police.

They say in Miranda you don't need to have a

11

jailhouse lawyer available or a policehouse lawyer

12

available because you can make a decision that you are not

13

going to get an attorney there right away, but just

14

remember you can't interrogate until you do it.
QUESTION:

15

May I ask this?

Did Miranda overrule

16

Zerbst?

17

right.

18

when you are being interrogated.

19

you look to all of the facts and circumstances.

20

overruled in Miranda?

21

It said you may waive almost any constitutional
You can certainly waive the right to have counsel

MR. MC GREEVY:

And, Zerbst said that

I don't believe so.

Was that

I believe

22

that Miranda still permits a waiver, but I see Miranda as

23

saying really — I think there are two kinds of waivers or

24

a waiver at two levels that can take place.

25

suspect is advised of his rights, you have a right to have

When a

an attorney present, the suspect can at that time make a

2

knowing, intelligent, voluntary waiver of that right and

3

say, no, I don't want an attorney, I will talk to you.

4

That is a waiver.
You get a different waiver question, I really

5

6

think, when that suspect has said I need my attorney.

7

Then he has, in effect, said I can't deal with you without

8

help.
QUESTION:

that said that?

11

to cite one.

Is there any case prior to Edwards

The answer is no.

MR. MC GREEVY:

12

You haven't been able

I think that Miranda does, but I

13

don't think I can say that it is holding in the strict

14

sense of the word.

Do you think Miranda modified Zerbst?

It didn't say so.

17

MR. MC GREEVY:

QUESTION:

19

22

Zerbst has been cited any number of

times since.
MR. MC GREEVY:

20
21

Well, I —

I am not sure how to respond to

that.
The point that I wish to make with respect to

23

Miranda is that — and I need to address just for a moment

24

the retroactivity question if we ever reach that, if the

25

Court reaches that question.

It seems to me that if we view Edwards as

2

establishing a new principle, then it seems to me it was

3

abundantly foreshadowed by Miranda, because Miranda said

think all Edwards did was reinforce that, give life to it,
