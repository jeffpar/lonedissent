We will hear first this

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIICTT SCHULDER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. SCHULDER*

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
The question in this case is whether a

11

12 depcrtable alien whc first arrived in this country mere
13

than seven years before applying for suspension of

14

depertatien can establish physical presence in the

15 United
16

States for a continuous period of seven years

when during that seven-year period the alien's illegal

17 presence in this country was interrupted by a
18 three-month trip abroad at the conclusion of which the
19

alien knowingly misrepresented her immigration status tc

20 secure reentry to the United States.

The facts cf this case are as fellows*

21

22 Respondent is a native and citizen of Thailand who first
23 arrived in the United States in 1969 as a nonimmigrant
24 student, and she was authorized to remain until July 25,
25

1971.

Her husband arrived in this country in

1968 also

3

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

as a nonimmigrant student.

He was also authorized tc

2 remain until July 1971.
Both Respondent and her husband remained

3
4 beyond

the July 25,

1971 date.

The Immigration and

5 Naturalization Service instituted deportation
6

proceedings in 1977 charging that Respondent had

7 overstayed her visa.

Respondent conceded depcrtability but applied-

8

9 for suspension of deportation under Section 244(a)(1) of
10 the Immigration and Nationality Act.
11

Section 244(a)(1)

permits the Attorney General or his delegates to suspend

12 deportation of an alien who shows that he was physically
13

present in the United States for a continuous period of

14 seven years immediately preceding the application for
15 suspension of deportation who also shows that he

was a

16 person

of good moral character during that seven-year

17 period

and who also is able to show that he is a

person

18 whose deportation would in the opinion of the Attorney
19 General result in extreme hardship tc the alien or tc
20 certain family members who are U.S.

21

resident aliens.
In this case Respondent admitted that from

22

23 January
24

citizens or lawful

1974 until April 18, 1974 she was absent from

the United States when she and her two children took a

25 trip to Thailand to visit her mother.

The Immigration

4

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 020-9300

1

judge concluded that this absence was meaningfully

2

interruptive of the continuity of Respondent's physical

3

presence in the United States.

4

The judge applying the factors developed ly

5 this court in Rosenberg v. Fleuti pointed to several

8 factors, first, the length cf the absence which in this
7 case was three months.

The fact that Respondent

8 obtained travel documents prior to the trip and

9

while

she was abroad tended to demonstrate the deliberateness

10

with which the trip was undertaken and pointed to the

11

fact that Respondent had an opportunity to consider the

12

significance cf her trip cn her immigration status.

13

Finally, the Immigration judge noted that

14

Respondent knowingly misrepresented her status as the

15

spouse of a nonimmigrant student even though her

16 husband's student visa had expired approximately two and
17
18
19

a half years earlier.
QUESTION*

Mr. Schulder, did the Service bring

any kind cf proceeding against the husband?

20

MR. SCHUIDER *

21

QUESTION*

22

MR. SCHUIDER*

23

Yes, it did.

Rhat is the status of that one?
The husband's proceeding -- The

Immigration judge found the husband had met the

24 requirements of the statute and was eligible, and I
25

believe the judge fcund that the husband should be

5

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

granted relief under the suspension cf deportation

2 statute.

The Board cf Immigration Appeals reversed that

3 and the Board in turn was reversed by the Court cf
4

Appeals so the matter was sent back to the Eoard cf

5 Immigration Appeals for further proceedings.
I am net aware whether any further proceedings

6

7 have in fact been held with respect to the husband’s
8 case.
9

QUESTION;

As far as you know he, too, is

10 still in this country.
11

MB. SCHULEERi

12

QUESTIONS

That is correct.

Mr. Schulder, as long as you are

13 interrupted what is the status of any reapplicaticn now
14 by the Petitioner?
15

ME. SCKULEERs

Petitioner reapplied for

18 suspension of deportation before the Board of
17

Immigration Appeals while after this Court granted

18 certiorari she argued that more than seven years had
19 elapsed since the 1974 trip and claimed that she was
20 entitled to have her deportation proceedings reopened
21

for a new application for suspension of deportation.

22

That application for motion to reopen is still pending

23 before the Board of
24

QUESTION;

Immigration Appeals.
It is your position that that dees

25 not' make this case moot because of the discretionary

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

nature of that proceeding

2

ME. SCHUIDEEs

3

The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the

4

That is correct. Your Honor.

Immigration judge’s decision.

In addition to the

5 factors mentioned by the Immigration judge the Ecard
3 pointed cut that Sespondent

had overstayed her visa

7 before her trip to Thailand and she reentered this

8 country by misrepresenting her status.
9

According to -the Ecard, the trip, therefcre,

10 substantially increased the likelihood that Respondent’s
11

illegal status would be discovered and that Respondent

12 would be deported.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth

13 Circuit reversed.
14

The Court concluded that the factors

15 enumerated in Fleuti were merely evidentiary with
16 respect to the significance of an alien's absence and
17 that even if an absence increases the risk of an alien’s
18 deportation it cannot be meaningfully interruptive if
19 the hardships associated with that deportation would be
20 equally severe if the absence had net occurred.
21

For the purposes of this case we accept the

22 application of the test announced in Fleuti in the
23 different context of suspension of deportation.

Since

24 the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Wadman v.

1969,

25 both the courts and

INS in

the Ecard of Immigration Appeals

7

1

have applied the Fleuti standards in determining whether

2 an absence by an alien was meaningfully interruptive of
3

the continuity cf the alien's physical presence.

4

In other words, we believe —

6 standards for the purposes cf this case.

What does that

MR. SCHULDER:

No, Your Honor, but just in the

11

decision and the issues that are —
QUESTION*

12

Put ycu are not suggesting that the

13 Agency nc longer wants to fellow the Fleuti standard?

MR. SCHUIDERs

14
15 fact,

Ch , nc.

Nc, Ycur Honor.

Ir

the Agency believes that there is room for

16 flexibility in applying the statute.
17
18

The problem here, however, is that the test
created by the Ccurt of Appeals far exceeds any

19 flexibility that was permitted by this Court in Fleuti.
20 In fact, it wrenches the Fleuti test out of the context
21

in which that test was created, and it prcduces wholly

22

irrational results in our view.

23

Fleuti, in fact, created a very narrow rule to

24 deal with an exceptional situation where the literal
25 construction of

the statute would subject the alien to

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the sport of chance and meaningless and irrational

2 hazards that were noted in the Court’s cpinicn in
3

Fleuti.

The Court relied largely on the analysis of

4 Judge Hand in his decision in CiFasquale v.

Karnuth and

5 on this Court’s earlier decision on Delgadillo v.

6 Carmichael.
QUESTION;

7

Nr. Schulder, is it not also true

8

that the Court relied on the comparison of the test cf

9

residence where there could he more substantial

10 interruptions under the residence standard in the Fleuti
11

opinion?

12

notion that residents may be interrupted for a different

13

purpose?
ME. SCHULLER;

14
15

Did net the Court also find support in the

You are saying the Court cf

Appeals in this case?
QUESTION;

16

Fc , no.

I am talking about the

17 Supreme Court in the Fleuti opinion itslef because that
18

did not confine its reasoning to the examples you give.

19

It also drew support from the fact that in measuring

20

residence Congress has allowed substantial interruptions

21

not to interrupt residence.
NR. SCHULDER;

22

That is true.

The Court’s

23 opinion did point to that prevision of the Immigration
24
25

Act.

QUESTION;

Right.

MR. SCHULDER«

1

Of course, this case involves a

2 separate statute which dees not refer tc residence bet
3

which refers to physical presence.

4

QUESTIONS

5

MR. SCHUIDERs

6

Right.
In fact, the statute had been

amended to exclude residence and to insert physical

7 presence into the statute.

QUESTIONS

8

Did Fleuti involve the same

9 sta tute?
10

MR. SCHUlCERs

11

provision of the Immigration Act.
QUESTION*

12

No, Fleuti involved a different

In your opinion that makes no

13 difference?

MR. SCHULDERs

14
15

Well, as I said before since

1964 when the Ninth Circuit applied the same test that

16 had been developed by this Court in Fleuti for the
17 separate statutory context of the suspension of
18 deportation statute both the courts and the Board of
19 Immigration Appeals have applied the Fleuti standards.
20 As the

Court had said in Wadman the Court believed that

21

the word "continuous" in this statute should no more be

22

read rigidly as the word "intent” or net intended in the

23 entry prevision of the statute that was at issue in
24 Fleuti .
25

We agree that a certain amount of flexibility

1C

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

is proper under the statute.

The flexible construction

2 of the entry provision in Fleuti as the Court pointed
3 out in

that case protects a resident alien from the

4 unsuspected risks and unintended consequences of wholly
5 innocent action.
8

QUESTION;

Under the plain language of the

7 statute where do you find the flexibility?
3

HR. SCHULDER:

The plain language of the

9 statute I would —
10

QUESTION;

Is not flexible is it?

11

HR. SCHUIDER;

— certainly would not tend to

12 support a flexible reading.

13

QUESTICN;

Is there anything in the

14 legislative history that suggests flexibility?
15

HR. SCRUICER;

The only thing in the

13 legislative history that might suggest flexibility is
17 the history of the suspension of deportation statute
13 before the insertion of the particular language at issue
10 here.

In other words, the whole notion of suspending

20 deportation was one that was developed by Congress in
21

order to give the Attorney General some discretion to

22 grant relief in cases which previously had only beer.
23 covered by private bills submitted to Congress.
24

QUESTION;

Is there anything in the

25 legislative history that suggests an absence of

11
\

AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20C01 (202) 628-8300

1

congressional intent to provide flexibility?
ME. SCHUIEERs

2

Yes, there are indications in

3 the legislative history that indicate that Congress
4

meant the statute to be construed quite strictly if not

5 literally.
6

QUESTION;

If so, why does the Solicitor

7 General take the position you have stated here?

8

MR. SCHULDER;

The reason for our position

9 essentially is that the Board of Immigration Appeals
10 which is the delegate of the Attorney General and has
11

been administering this statute has in a sense

12 acquiesced in the application of the Fleuti standards to
13 this particular statute.
14

As we pointed out in our reply brief we

15 certainly think that there ought to be room in the
16 statute to cover certain kinds of situations, for
17 example, the situation that was involved in

the

18 DiPasquale v. Karnuth situation where an alien took an
19 overnight train from Euffalc tc Detrcit.
20
21

There was nothing in the record

established that he knew that the train was going tc go

22 through Canada during the night.
23

that

Certainly there must

be, we think, some room in the statute for flexible

24 application, and we think that both

the courts and the

25 Board of Immigration Appeals and the Immigration

judges

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

have been applying the Fleuti standards here.
They know the contours cf the test, and they

2

3 have been applying it without any major problems until
4 the Ninth Circuit in this case in its earlier opinion in
5 Kamheangpatiycoth totally obliterated the -QUESTION:

6

Did the government seek certiorari

7 in the Madman case?
8

HR. SCHULDER;

No, I do not believe so.

9

Under the Fleuti test the question essentially

10 is whether it is reasonable to conclude that the alien

11

should have considered the adverse immigration

12 consequences of a trip abroad.

Applying the Fleuti

13 factors to this test we submit that Respondent clearly
14 should have considered the adverse implications cf her
15 trip.
16

For one thing, the trip itself was quite

17 lengthy.

It was three months in duration, a substantial

18 period of time especially when compared to the two-hcur
19 trip across the border involved in Fleuti.
Second, Respondent obtained travel documents

20
21

prior to the trip evidencing the fact that she had an

22 opportunity to consider the consequences of the trip.
23 Third,

Respondent had been here illegally for two and a

24 half years when she left for Thailand.
25

During the trip she knowingly misrepresented

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

her immigration status to obtain a reentry visa and

2 thereby increased the risk that her illegal status would
3 be discovered.

QUESTIONS

4
5 question?
6 relied

Mr. Schulder, could I ask one

These factors I think unquestionably could be

on by the Attorney General as a matter of

7 discretion to deny suspension even if you should lose
8 here.

Is it your position on the eligibility for

9

10 consideration as a discretionary matter that every three
11

months interruption would be sufficient to defeat the

12 continuous presence requirement?

MR. SCHULDERs

13

I think it would be the

14 government’s position that three months is simply tec
15 substantial a period of time.

Excuse me?

How about one month?
Well, as we say in our brief we

lines as to what the quantum is of —

What is the standard of judicial

24

MR. SCHULDERs

25

QUESTIONS

The standard of judicial —

You are asking us to say this is

1b

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

unreasonable?
ME. SCHULEER*

2

Sell, we are asking the Ccurt

3 to apply the test that was established in Fleuti and to
4

conclude that the test that was created by the Ccurt of

5 Appeals in this case is totally inconsistent with
3

Fleuti.

7

QUESTION*

8

ME. SCHULEER*

9

QUESTION*

10

That is correct.

Because of all of the factors cr

just the three months?
ME. SCHUIDER*

11
12

Totally inconsistent.

No, because what the Court cf

Appeals did here was essentially ignored all cf the

13 factors that were enumerated in Fleuti and said
14 even though there was an absence of
15

though

that

three months, even

there were travel documents obtained, even though

18 there was a misrepresentation about status in order to
17

reenter so long as the alien can show that there are

18 hardships associated with deportation then the alien has
19 established continuous physical presence for a

20 seven-year period even though she was gene for three
21

months.

We think that that simply turns Fleuti on its

22 head.
23
24

QUESTION*

What would you say about a

three-month absence which was explained by the

25 individual showing that he became ill on arriving in

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Thailand and was net permitted by the doctors to leave

2 until he had fully recovered three months later?
3

Would

that explanation satisfy the government's standard?
MR. SCHDIDER:

4

It would seem to me that that

5 certainly would satisfy the standards of the Immigration
6 Service because in that situation the alien simply would
7 have no choice in the matter.

QUESTION:

8

Was there any explanation offered

9 here?

MR. SCHULDER:

10
11

No, there was not.

In

Respondent's Court of Appeals brief her attorney claimed

12 that the trip was to visit her sick mother, but

there is

13 nothing in the record of the administrative proceedings
14 in this case that shews that Respondent's mother was ill
15 or that the illness if there was any necessitated or
16 occasioned the trip.

QUESTION:

17

Mr. Schulder, my first hypothetical

18 is if somebody goes to Thailand because her mother is
19 ill and it develops that her mother has appendicitis
20 which is over in a week, that would be okay I would
21
22

23

assume .
MR. SCHUIDER:
QUESTION:

I would assume so. Your Honor.

Suppose it develops it was cancer

24 and it took three months.

Would that make any

25 difference?

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

MR. SCHULDER;

I think, it would make a

The alien has tc ccnsider — The point cf

3 this whole test is whether, the alien should have
4 considered that there would he adverse consequences.
5 This was an alien who had illegally overstayed her visa

6 in this country.
7

She certainly should he charged with knowing

8 that a trip abroad certainly a lengthy trip abroad -9

QUESTION*

Would that apply to the one-week

trip to Thailand?

MR. SCHULDER*

In the case of an alien who had

12 been here illegally I would say -13

1

HR. SCHUIDERs

No, well Wadman itself involved

2 an alien who had been here lawfully crier to the trip,
3 and the factors —
4

QUESTIONS

But you say the statute does not

5 apply if the alien is here having overstayed his time.
6 You are not saying that are you?
7

MR. SCHUIDERs

No, I am net saying that.

The

8 question is whether an absence is meaningfully

interruptive of the continuity of the alien's physical
10 presence in the country.
11

QUESTIONS

That is --

You say three months it is.

Some

12 people take a vacation for three months.
13

HR. SCHUIDERs

14

QUESTION:

That is correct.

You would not consider that an

15 interruption would ycu?
16

MR. SCHUIDERs

I would consider that a

17 disruption in the context of this particular statute.
18 The question here is whether the Court should stretch
1

the meaning cf the statute tc benefit an alien in

20 Respondent's position.
21

QUESTION:

Hr. Schulder, is it not true that

22 unlike the situation that arose in Fleuti where the
23 question is whether an entry was made which could
24 involve a permanent resident whe is lawfully here, is it
25 not true that by hypothesis under this statute where the

18

1

consideration whether to suspend deportation that there

2

is an illegal presence in every case?
MR. SCHULDER:

3

There is not necessarily an

4 illegal presence before the trip.

In Wadman there was

5 not .
QUESTIONS

3

But at least it is illegal as of

7 the time of application to suspend deportation.

MR. SCHULEER:

8
9
10

That is correct.

In

Kamheangpatiyooth again there was no illegal presence at
the time of the trip.

11

QUESTIONS

Mr. Schulder —

12

QUESTIONS

Do all of these hypotheticals that

13 keep pushing you in one direction and then in another
14

suggest that government would be tetter off adhering to

15

the strict language cf the statute and the legislative

16 history?

You would still exercise discretion in the

17 case where the train cressed the Canadian border?

I am talking now about what judges should do.

18

19 What standard is there once you leave the statute and
20

the legislative history?

QUESTION:

As soon as you leave the statute

6

Attorney General?

7

still have the remedy they used to have before the

In other words, if you prevail they

8 statute was enacted.
HR. SCHULDER;

9

That is correct.

As I was pointing cut to the Court, the

10
11

problem of the test that the Court of Appeals adopted

12

here is that even where the Immigration authorities shew

13

that the alien has taken a substantial trip abroad, has

14

falsified information in order to return, has obtained

15 travel
16

documents, all these factors are totally iancred

so long as the alien can establish that there was no

17 diminution of hardship.

In our view this compresses two separate

18
19

elements of the statute, the extreme hardship element

20

that the Court dealt with in the Wang case and the

21

continuous physical presence element that is involved

22 here,

into one element.

23 at pages 19 and

In fact, in Respondent’s brief

23 Respondent’s counsel admits that he

24 cannot come up with any example of a situation where an
25 alien could

show extreme hardship but not continuous

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

physical presence under the statute.
The upshot of the Court of Appeals* approach

2

3 here is that it essentially converts the continuous
4 physical presence language of the statute into a
5 continuous residence requirement.

In cur view the test

8 of the Court of Appeals would not be any different or

7 lead to any different results if the statute simply said
8 residence instead of physical presence.

But as I said earlier in response to Justice

9

10 Stevens* question Congress inserted the words
11

"physically present" in the statute in 1952 in place of

12 residence in order to discontinue the lax practices and

13 to discourage abuses that had arisen under the residence
14 standard.

In order to give meaning to Congress* action

15 here we submit that the judgment cf the Court of

Appeals

16 should be reversed.
17

I would like to reserve the remainder cf my

18 time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERT D. GREENBERG, ESQ.,

2

CK EEBAIF CF RESPONDENT
MR. GREENBERG*

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

4 please the Courts

Respondent's position, one position in this

S
3

matter

is that the action at bar is actually moot.

The

7 Respondent has accumulated seven years* continuous
8

physical presence in the United States since her return

9

from Thailand in April 1974.
Since the filing of this case, therefore, and

10
11

the Respondent's independent qualification on the sole

12

question presented to this Court, namely, did she have

13

the seven years’ continuous presence, we believe that

14

this Court should abate proceedings and wait for a

15 decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals on the
16 pending motion which has been on file since February of
17

this year*

18

The Board —

19

QUESTION;

Mr. Greenberg, if the statute

20 simply allows discretion in the Attorney General
21

assuming someone has been continuously present here for

22 that interval of time to grant relief or not, how can
23 you argue that it is moot?

Your argument is really that

24 we should defer to the administrative proceedings and
25 let them decide it because it might become moot, but it

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

certainly is not moot today is it?

2

ME. GREENEEBG s

3 Your Honor.

Hell, I believe it can be.

The Immigration judge in the hearing found

4 Respondent eligible for two of the three statutory

5 requirements of Section 244.
The Respondent was found eligible as having

6

7 good moral character and as demonstrating extreme

8 hardship albeit through her daughter's illness.

The

9 hardship was imputed to her through her daughter's

10 illness, and the only issue that the Immigration judge
11

did not find for her on and did find for the husband on

12 all three issues was did she have a continuous

13 seven-year presence.

Petitioner's argument is without that she

14
15 cannot

have any eligibility for 244 relief.

He simply

16 say she —

Well, even if she met all the

18 qualifications, is there not a residuum of discretion in
19 the Attorney General whether tc apply it cr net?

MR. GREENBERG:

20
21

Yes, Your Honor.

It would

just seem peculiar tc me that if she were found eligible

22 at the

time of the Immigration hearing as tc moral

23 character and extreme hardship and for the fact that she
24 did not have the seven years then but she has it new, I
25 would think it appropriate for the Beard to first make a

8 is it?
9
10

MR. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Okay, Your Honor.

Eut your position would simply

11

allow an alien who can postpone the inevitable for a

12

while to come in at the end by virtue of seven years*

13 residence even though three or four years might have
14 been simply pursuant tc fighting something that the
15 alien ultimately loses.
16

MR. GREENBERG;

Well, it is our position that

17 the Respondent was eligible then at the time of

the

18 hearing, but since there was an adverse decision on that
19 one issue and since seven years has passed we did r.ct
20 see why the Respondent should get a hearing on that
21
22

matter prior to coming to this tribunal.
QUESTION:

Mr. Greenberg, we have been testing

23 hypetheticals from three months dewn.

You obviously

24 think three months is not a serious interruption.
25

What about four, five, six or seven months?

5 do not believe that there can be a purely mechanical
6 test as to one day cut cf the country or three weeks out

7 of the country because we are dealing with human beings
8 and everybody --

QUESTION;

9

Here we are dealing with three

10 months sc let's start there.

ME. GREENBERG;

11

All right.

Depending upon the

12 totality of circumstances in this case the Immigration

13 judge firstly has to make a decision whether based cr
14 the precedent decisions that are used here, the Fleuti,
15 the Wadman doctrine, the Kamheangpatiyccth standard
16 ennounced by the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Ninth
17 Circuit, making it an individual determination on the
18 totality of circumstances surrounding each of the three
19 elements of Section 244, being the trier of fact does he
20 feel,
21
22

dees the Immigration judge feel that that person's

entry constituted a break in a seven-year period.
If you do not have some type cf standard like

23 that what you will have in every Immigration court
24 around the United States is second-guessing by
25 Immigration judges because nobody has a standard to

The government has conceded if I

In fact, there is an error which the counsel has

There was an error in the transcript -- net an

There was an error done in our

brief indicating that the trip abroad was tc visit her

Once again, if we apply this

extension of the Fleuti-Wadman doctrine that the

make a decision whether the absence was interruptive of

7 filed on Kamheangpatiyooth sc we really have an

If the Immigration does that and the Beard

let me go back.

You say that the

5 congressional remedy is no longer available.
6 has it

Hew lerg

been true that there really is no congressional

7 remedy because as I understand the background of this
8 statute its purpose was to turn over a group of

9 decisions to the Attorney General that Congress had
10 previously been making.

Did they immediately change their rules sc

12 that there no longer was a remedy as you say there is

introduction whereas prior to that prior to the

2

Immigration Service’s complaints about private bills was

3

they would sit for two sessions of Congress as more or

4 less a courtesy to the Congressman or Senator that
5 introduced it.

But that is not the case any more.

6

QUESTIONI

I see.

7

MR. GREENEERGs

I dc not think many practicing

8 immigration lawyers rely on private bills to assist them
9

with their clients.

10

QUESTION:

11

through my mind is that maybe a strict construction

12 would

13

The thought that was running

be very appropriate if there is a congressional

remedy as there had teen in

the past.

If there is no

14 longer a congressional remedy available perhaps the
15 statute should be construed

a little differently.

16

That is the problem I am wrestling with.

17

MR. GREENEERG:

18

QUESTION:

I understand.

May I ask whether there was a quota

19 on immigration from Thailand at the time of the case?
20

MR. GREENBERG:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, there was, Your Honor.

Where there Thai citizens awaiting

22 their turn to come into the United States under that
23 quota?
24

MR. GREENBERG:

With these particular people,

25 the Respondent here, no.

QUESTIONS

From Thailand, not these people.

2

HR. GEEENEERG s

3

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

But there were Thai people awaiting

4 their turn to come into the United States lawfully.
5

ME. GEEEKEEEG;

6

QUESTION;

That is correct, Your Hcnct.

Was it not the intention of

7 Congress to protect the interest of people who were

8 operating in accordance with the laws of the United
9 States primarily rather than people who were depcrtatle
10 who had disobeyed our laws?
11

HE. GEEEKEEEG:

I believe so, Your Honor.

12

My last point is simply that the Petitioner

13 herein in their brief and in their argument is seeking
14

to do basically what they are accusing Eespondent of of

15 collapsing two of the three elements of Section 244

into

16 each other in effect saying that if the Immigration
17 judge finds hardship do not worry so much about seven
18 years and do not worry so much about good moral
19 cha rac ter.
20

Eespondent *s position is that is not the

21

situation at all that the Respondent believes that each

22

factor of Section 244 shall be independently determined

23 by the Immigration judge.
24

In fact, in this case the

Immigration judge first made a finding on hardship

25 before he even looked at the issue of seven years*

residence or good moral character.
In summation, we believe that the standards

2
3

set forth by the Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit

4 describing a totality of circumstances test for
5

adjudicating Section 244 is fair, and we do believe that

6 the case is moot at this point and
7

there is a proper

relief before the Eoard of Immigration Appeals with the

8 pending motion.
Thank you.
