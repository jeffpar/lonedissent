CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

We vill hear arguments

Mr. Fabricant.

OR.®. L ARGUMENT OE PETER J. FABRICANT, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FABRICANT:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On February 12, 1981 law enforcement officials

9
10

forceably entered the home of the Petitioners.

At the

11

time of the entry the police had no search warrant or

12

arrest warrant nor the consent of any of the occupants.
No exigent circumstances existed which could

13
14

justify the actions of the police.

The only excuse for

15

the entry was the belief by the police that contraband

16

was concealed within the dwelling.
Having once violated the privacy of the home

17
18

the police removed all of the occupants and remained

19

there by themselves for a continuous period of some

20

hours.

21

based on knowledge they possessed many hours before the

22

entry and occupation, and upon execution of the warrant

23

contraband was discovered secreted within the premises.

24
25

19

Thereafter the police obtained a search warrant

The question before this Court is whether that
contraband should be suppressed.

We respectfully submit

*

1

that the unlawful entry into# seizure and 19 hour

2

continuous occupation of the Petitioners* home

3

constituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment not

4

only of the home but of its contents.

5

Since the actions of the police constituted a

6

seizure of the contraband before the search warrant was

7

ever obtained any doctrine cf attenuation under the

8

exclusionary rule would not apply in this case# and in

9

fact the purposes of the exclusionary rule would be

10

achieved by its application here.
The facts are not in doubt.

11

On February 12,

12

1981 in New York City at about 5*30 in the afternoon the

13

police observed what appeared to them to be a drug

14

transaction on the streets of Queens, New York.
At 6s30, an hour later, they telephoned the

15
16

United States Attorneys* Office for the Eastern District

17

of New York to make inquiries about perhaps arresting

18

the Petitioners and getting a search warrant to search

19

their apartment in Queens, New York.

20

an Assistant United States Attorney at 6*30 in the

21

evening that the magistrate was not around, and he

22

suggested or directed the police to go to the premises,

23

the apartment building, to arrest the Petitioners if

24

they saw them and to secure the premises from the

25

outsid e.

They were told by

9

I say

Counsel, I suppose you would

10

concede that there was probable cause for the issuance

11

of a warrant on the afternoon that you described where

12

the police saw the delivery of this parcel to the two

13

other people.
MR. F ABPICANTi

14

Well, a warra nt was ev entually

15

signed and it was based on the information that the

16

police had before they entered the apartment.

You concede that was probable

MR. FABRICANT;

Yes, as has been so held by

the District Court and the Court of Appeals.

21

QUESTION;

Yes.

22

YR. FABRICANT*

Put I believe, Justice Powell,

23

that it is the neutral and detached.magistrate who in

24

the first instance must make the determination of

25

probable cause.

T think one of the main problems in

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

this case is that the police, sure,

deal of suspicion that there was contraband in the

apartment, but the Constitution and

it while they are getting a warrant.

MR. FABRICANT:

15

the police

Now why is

It is different because it is

16

in a home where one has the highest expectation of

17

privacy.

18

Chadwick -- Well, Chadwick dealt with a footlccker that

19

I believe was being put into an automobile and Arkansas

20

v. Sanders dealt with a suitcase which was in an

21

automobile or being carried around by somebody outside.

22

In Arkansas v. Sanders and in United States v.

The difference is I believe twofold.

First of

23

all, the actions of the police in Arkansas v. Sanders

24

and United States v.

25

considered as reasonable because un der tli e circumstances

Chadwick in the seizure might be

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the mobility of the suitcase and the footlocker would

2

mean that if they went to get a warrant the automobiles

3

and the suitcases with the possible contraband in them

4

would not be around any more.

5

The other difference is that in Sanders and

6

Chadwick the police were at a place and in a position

7

where they had an absolute right to be.

8

in somebody's house.

That would have been

that an initial illegal entry and then withdrawal and

the waiting outside does not constitute a seizure of the

I submit that the entry and the remaining

of the Petitioners.

MR. FABRICA.NT;

What is the difference?
There.is no difference in that

QUESTION;

You said there was a difference.

MR. FABRICANT;

he.

There is no difference in

6

the movement of people in and cut of the apartment, but

7

there is a difference concerning your invasion of

8

privacy of what is inside your dwelling.
QUESTION;

9

There is a difference I submit by

10

people moving in and out becuase moving in and cut can

11

carry in and out.

12

ME. FABRICAHT;

13

QUESTION;

So there is a difference.

14

QUESTION;

Well, don't you have to say that

15

the warrant is the product of the illegal entry?
MR. FABRICANT;

16
17

Correct.

White,

No, I do not believe, Justice

that you have to say that in this case.

Why not?

I don't, think that the warrant

The on ly thing that was admitted

was the materials that were found after the warrant was

That is correct.

It rested on

there had never been any warrant issued and no search

That is absolutely — and

Just like it was in this case.

QUESTION;

That is correct.

So why isn't that a sufficient

17

remedy

for the illegal entry just render inadmissible

18

what they seized prior to the warrant?
HP. FABRICANT:

19

Well, I think that depends on

20

your definition of seizure.

21

the illegal entry coupled with the 19 hour occupation

22

equals a seizure not only of what they saw in open view

23

but of

24

discovered.

25

It is my contention that

what they suspected was there but had not yet

It might have gene somewhere else.

the occupation of that house taints the later seizure?

No, that is not the only

11

My question was intended to put it

12

on the first part of the question that the government

13

may never profit or secure any advantage toward a

14

prosecution if it flows from an illegal entry of a

15

home.

16

MR. FABRICANT*

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

The advantage that was secured in

18

this
case with respect to the seizures made after the
•

19

warrant was issued was just that the evidence was still

20

there and it might not have been if they had not been in

21

the home.

22
23

25

MR. FABRICANT*

Well, it probably would have

still been there even if they had secured the premises.

What kind of advantage then did the

government get by the illegal entry?

I

Well, you also have a problem that

7

you really have not met yet of saying that the illegal

8

9

it did keep the people who were found to be on the

10

premises from destroying the evidence.

11

KB. FBEYs

Well, let me turn to --

12

QUESTION;

You still have to get to that.

13

MB. FREY;

Yes.

My colleague has not reallly

14

relied on that theory, but I will turn from the seizure

15

theory which seems to me quite untenable for the moment

16

to this more traditional fruits kind of inquiry that you

17

are suggesting which is that the possibility that the

18

evidence would have been destroyed before they got a

19

warrant suggests that the evidence found under the

20

warrant should be treated as a fruit if I understand

21

your question.

22

Now I have several responses to that,

and this

23

is a little bit like the flip side of the inevitable

24

discovery cases where what you are dealing with is a

25

hypothetical independent source.

The evidence was

34

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

actually found during an illegal search, but the

2

government can hypothesize that it would have been

3

discovered in any event.
Here the shoe is on the other foot, and it is

4
5

the defendant who is hypothesizing that the evidence

6

would have been destroyed had the entry not been made.

7

Now there are a couple of problems with that.
First is that the destruction of evidence is a

8
9

crime.

The purpose of the Fourth Amendment is not to

10

aid offenders in the destruction of evidence to prevent

11

the uncovery of their acts, and I do not believe as a

12

matter of exclusionary rule policy that it would be

13

appropriate to treat the possibility of destruction of

14

evidence where that is the sole hypothetical nexus

15

between the illegality and the discovery of the evidence

16

as a causal connection which bridges the gap and

17

transmits the taint to the discovery of the evidence.

MR. FREYs

15

I think the question in these circumstances is

16

what is reasonable during the time when the officers are

17

procuring a warrant in terms of immobilizing the

18

premises, and there are a lot of interesting questions.

19

I do not think this Court has by any means explored all

20

of the ramifications of this issue, but I do think that

21

there is another feature of allowing the potential

22

destruction of the evidence to be used as establishing a

23

causal connection which is noteworthy and which the

24

Court of Appeals noted.

25

Oh, Illinois v. Sandreyas.

That is the adherent contradiction or irony in

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

saying that on the one hand the entry was illegal

2

because there was no sufficient danger of destruction of

3

the evidence, yet on the other hand the discovery of the

4

evidence was a fruit of the illegal entry because it

5

would have been destroyed had the officers not entered.

6

Now the result of this approach is to penalize the

7

officers for being right about the dangers of

8

evidentiary destruction.

Isn’t there another problem here?

Whether the Fourth Amendment is the right way to analyze

it I am not certain, and I point out that the 19 hours

is not a problem in this particular case because the two

people who were entitled to access to the apartment were

both subject to the arrest, and they were both in jail.

MR. FREY:

arrest of Colon would be invalid under Payton v. New

applying the exclusionary rule at an initial appearance

QUESTION;

6

MR. FREY;

We have not challenged that.

I

7

think the Court of Appeals made one mistake in its

8

analysis which we did not mention in our brief which is

9

that when they went and knocked on the door and Colon

10

opened the door they then knew before they had committed

11

any Fourth Amendment violation that the apartment was

12

occupied.
The Court of Appeals’ finding of no exigent

13

circumsntaces did not rest solely on that but rested

15

also on the lack of sufficient probability if they had

16

just arrested Segura and taken him away that the

17

occupants would have destroyed the evidence.

1

I want to get to the point about if we are

2

going to worry about deterrents in the air should we

3

just abandon the Court’s normal principles of requiring

4

a nexus between the evidence and the illegality because

5

something that has concerned some courts a rule that

6

would allow the use of evidence in a case like this may

7

unduly encourage the police to engage in Fourth

8

Amendment violations.
There are several things to be said about

9
10

that.

11

not inherently — The rule for which we contend dees not

12

inherently lend itself to encouraging flagrant

13

violations of the Fourth Amendment because the more

14

clear it is to the police that there are no exigent

16

circumstances the less they have to gain by entering the

16

premises rather than waiting for the warrant which they

17

fully believe they have probable cause to get and will

18

get.

19

The first is that this is a situation which does

When they enter the premises they can only

20

have the benefit of evidence that is held not to be a

21

fruit of the entry so under the holding of the Court of

22

Appeals in this case and as I think Justice O'Connor

23

pointed out earlier they still run the substantial risk

24

that evidence that is found during the original unlawful

26

entry if it is unlawful will be suppressed.

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

In addition, the problem of flagrant

1

2

violations is an area where civil liability is a

3

meaningful remedy.

4

flagrant violations is attenuated or offset by the fact

5

that if it is flagrant there is potential civil

6

liability.
