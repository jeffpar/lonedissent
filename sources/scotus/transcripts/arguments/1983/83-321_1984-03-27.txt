ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT SHAFER, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF CF PETITIONERS
MR. SHAFER;

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
We are here for three reasons.

10

The first

11

relates to the closure of a suppression hearing over a

12

defendant's objections.

13

statute which authorizes warrantless seizure of

14

"property subject to forfeiture," and it was upheld by

15

the court below.

remedy when police treat an otherwise valid warrant as a

17

license to conduct a totally indiscriminate search and

18

warrantless seizure.

19

in turn.

20

The second relates to the

And the third relates to the proper

I will address these issues each

First the closure.

We respectfully submit

21

that the Constitution guarantees open suppression

22

hearings, that suppression hearings may only be closed

23

upon a demonstration of compelling justification, and

24

then only if no means short of closure will achieve the

25

compelling state purpose.

QUESTION;

1

Does your argument extend to the

2

suppression hearings conducted previous to the

3

impaneling of the jury, as well as to a suppression

4

hearing conducted after the jury was impaneled?

5

MR. SHAFER;

Justice Rehnquist, we would net

6

rest on so technical a ground.

7

societal and defendant’s interests are in this context

8

so troad that we would not urge that the mere impaneling

9

of a jury is the predicate for the position we urge.

10

Philosophically, the

We say that, irrespective of whether a jury

11

has or has not been impaneled, that the interests are so

12

broad and so compelling that closure, particularly ever

13

a defendant’s objections, as in this case, cannot be

14

squared with the Sixth Amendment's commands.

15

bearing mind society’s interests and the. interests of

16

the criminal justice system —

21

perfectly open.

by the court.

The court refuses to suppress the

22

Under your theory, the closure of the motion

23

hearing would have violated the defendant's right to a

24

public trial.

25

violation?

What would be the remedy for that

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

MR. SHAFER;

1

The remedy for that violation

2

because it is such an egregious affront to the Sixth

3

Amendment right to open proceedings during the entire

4

course of criminal proceedings, and to the First

5

Amendment,

6

trivializing the significance of both of these

7

amendments, and that would be to send it back, for a new

8

trial in its entirety.

that there can be only one remedy without

9

Nothing short of that?

10

MR. SHAFERi

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. SHAFER;

Nothing short of that, no, sir.
Are you positive about that?
To treat it as a mere procedural

3

quirk,

without cloaking it with all the grandeur of

4

these two amendments, is to demean it.

5

an affront to both cf these amendments to treat it as

6

anything other than -QUESTION;

It’s too grave

Well, I took the Justice's

8

hypothetical to say there was nothing wrong with the

trial,

the trial was open all the way.

suppression hearing repeated, and wouldn't that

21

be enough by way of remedy?

22

MR. SHAFER;

23

QUESTION ;

I'm sorry,

Why wouldn't you

I don’t understand.

I understood that the hypothetical

24

given by Justice Rehnquist was to the effect that the

25

trial was perfectly open, the trial itself.

And why do

you have to have a new trial then?

2

suppression hearing, so to speak, be a sufficient

3

remedy ?
MR. SHAFER*

4

Wouldn’t a new

Justice Blackmun, we respectfully

5

suggest not.

As in the case of a grand jury net being

6

properly constituted, this Court has not sent cases

7

touching upon that infirmity back for the impaneling of

8

a new grand jury, but has vacated the conviction and

9

sent it back for a trial de novo.
Me believe that openness is of equal

10
11

significance and that it requires a new trial rather

12

than sending it back for a suppression hearing.

13

a more

14

case should not be sent back.

There was no justification for closure in this

The state asked for closure on the basis of a

case,

And even if the statute were held to require

20

closur e in this case while the state played its tapes,

21

the st atute could not conceivably authorize closure for

22

the re st of the seven-day hearing, and the tapes took

23

two an d a half hours to play.

24
25

Nothing in the record justified closure.
Georgi a Supreme Court said that the trial court

And of course, the court perceives, quite

8

rightly, the question of remedy here, and I trust that I

9

need not allude to that further.

10

Moving to the second issue, if the Court

11

please , and that deals with the facial validity of

12

Section 16-14-7(f)

cf the Georgia Code.

We submit that

we're dealing with a very special and a very dangerous

type of statute.

warrantless seizure only if it is incident to a lawful

search, arrest, or inspection.

invalid.

6

so long as property subject to forfeiture is so broadly

defined and so long as the judgment required to

determine whether such property is associated with a

It is our position that the statute

MR. SHAFER:

20

O'Connor, what was suppressed and what wasn't suppressed

and whether it was within the four corners of the

resisted each and every attempt we made to present

And the reason that we're not able to say

Justice O'Connor, is because the trial court

evidence on that question, whether in fact what was

2

seized was the result cf a pretextual warrant in the

3

nature cf a hoax perpetrated on an issuing judge and

4

subverted, corrupted into a general seizure? whether,

5

had the deponents disclosed to the issuing judge what

6

their intent was, whether he would then have authorized

7

or not authorized them to conduct the sort cf search

8

that they did.

9

QUESTION?

Hell, don’t we knew what property

10

was suppressed and what wasn’t?

11

ME. SHAFER?

Rut we don't knew whether it was

12

authorized to be seized.

13

We do know what was suppressed, but what we don’t knew

14

was what was left, whether that was legitimately

15

permitted to come in.

16

We don’t know -- excuse me.

That’s the problem.

We don’t know that

17

anything should have come in and we don't know whether

18

the judge, had he permitted the officers to obtain the

19

warrant and who were animated and guided by the

20

authorization in the warrant -- whether they did what

21

they were supposed to do, and if they didn't whether

22

they converted this otherwise facially valid warrant

23

into a general search.

Well, that’s your last argument,

but I’m trying to see whether this statutory question i

✓

1

In spite of the noble purposes set out in the

2

statute and in spite of the glcss put cn these purposes

3

by the Supreme Court of Georgia, in actuality to expect

4

a police officer conducting a search and seizure to

In practical effect, such a statute would

12

either never be applied because it is manifestly

13

unreasonable to expect an officer to make such a

14

probable cause determination, or the statute would be

15

applied despite its purported probable cause

17

In short, the statute would stand as an

18

invitation to lawless police action, which is precisely.

MS. WESTMORELAND:

1

Your Honor, what we submit

2

is that the initial basis for the request for the motion

3

was justified based on the fact that not only were the

4

tapes teing played, but other evidence was being

5

presented throughout the entire hearing.

6

The main thrust of the hearing on the motion

7

to suppress was electronic surveillance.

That was —

8

the majority of the motion to suppress was devoted to
the electronic surveillance, the manner in which it was

10

conducted, the persons who were surveilled, and various

11

other

12

things of this aspect.
During the motion to suppress hearing there

13

were references to individuals' phone numbers, other

14

individuals who may have had their telephones tapped

15

during this proceeding.

16

to suppress, I don't knew that the trial court knew

17

precisely to what limits the evidence would go during

18

the hearing on the motion to suppress, but we would

1

submit that there was a justification at the outset of

20

that hearing for closing the entire hearing.

what was the basis for the closure.

At this point I would like to move into some of

The trial court,

as I have noted previously,

that there were other persons potentially involved.

Is it ycur position that if anyone

else is involved or affected, that that is sufficient in

itself to close the hearing?

MS. WESTMORELAND*

Yes, Your Honor, we wculd

submit that — not just necessarily one individual, tut

in this circumstance we have the potential of so many

individuals being affected and so many individuals*

MS. WESTMORELAND:

1

Ycur Honor, the obvious

2

response is that there was still the potential for ether

3

evidence coming out, as I have noted previously.

QUESTION:

What kind of evidence?

MS. WESTMORELAND:

For instance, other

individuals* telephone numbers, names, and

that type of

7

information, which, while net necessarily within the

8

restrictions of the statute providing for the

9

publication, referring to the publication of wiretap

11

individuals.
QUESTION:

12

Was any suggestion made during the

13

proceeding that it should be opened at some later

14

stage?
MS. WESTMORELAND:

15

Of course, here the jury had been

MS. WESTMORELAND:

The jury had been

Assuming that the

But that's really ludicrous in a

way, to say that you conduct a new suppression hearing

where there's no suggestion that the absence of the

of law, as to whether evidence should be suppressed cr

not.

would be true and would fall in line with our argument

that it is actually, although the jury was impaneled, it

In the time that I have remaining, I would

like to move cn to the search and seizure issue that has

been presented to the Court.

23

that, as pointed out previously by Justice O'Connor, the

24

issue of the validity of the statute is simply not a

25

question that is properly presented to the Court.

In beginning, I would note

There

Evidence was suppressed which was allegedly

Petitioners have pointed to no evidence that was

themselves.

The statute does net give officers

2

authority to extend the bounds of the search itself.

3

The officers must be conducting a lawful search.

4

merely authorizes warrantless seizures under certain

5

specified, precise conditions.

It

We submit that this is no different from a

6

7

plain view type of seizure, which has been allowed on

8

pricr occasions.

9

seizure does not enlarge on the right to actually search

In the same context, the plain view

10

the area, but simply recognizes the fact that once an

11

officer is in a position to observe the evidence, to

12

observe documents, then to require that he obtain a

13

warrant at that point could in some circumstances

14

endanger the public, endanger the police, or could

15

simply result in the evidence being destroyed or lost

16

before a warrant could be obtained, and to require a

17

warrant under those circumstances would be an

18

inconvenience that is simply net required under Fourth
/

19
20

Amemdment principles.
Petitioners have also made a comment

21

concerning a lack of notice and hearing provided in the

22

statute, and we would submit that the statute itself,

23

while not providing for pricr notice and hearing, that

24

under the circumstances that a seizure would be taking

25

place that such notice and hearing prior to seizure is

10

those circumstances,

which dc not provide for the notice and hearing.

12

justifies the statutory provisions

The statute does provide for a hearing within

13

a very short time period thereafter, and we would submit

14

that that is clearly sufficient to meet the Fourth

15

Amendment requirements.
Finally, Petitioners assert that the search in

16
17

question was a general search and that all evidence

18

seized should have been excluded.

19

there is no justification presented in this record for

20

extending the exclusionary rule to such unreasonable

21

bounds as to exclude every piece of evidence seized in

22

this case.

23

We would submit that

The evidence would not support a conclusion

24

that the officers acted in flagrant disregard of the

25

search warrant.

The warrants were valid on the face of

45

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

those warrants, and there is no reason existing on this

2

record

to exclude evidence which was clearly lawfully

3

seized

pursuant to the warrant.

4

Tc do so would be to defeat the entire purpose

5

behind the exclusionary rule and would serve no

6

deterrent effect on the actions of police officers.

7

Therefore, we would submit that the Court should net

8

find a general search under the facts of this case, as

9

they simply do not warrant such a conclusion.

10

In conclusion. Your Honors, we would simply

11

urge that the Court conclude that there was no public

12

trial right that attached, and even if the public trial

13

right did attach at a suppression hearing it was net

14

violated under the facts of the instant case.

15

We would also urge the Court to conclude that

16

the statute providing for the RICO forfeitures was net

17

presented to this Court, as all evidence submitted at

18

trial was seized pursuant to a valid search warrant.

19

Even so, the statute is clearly valid on its face and

20

the facts of this case do net justify a finding that

21

there was a general search.
