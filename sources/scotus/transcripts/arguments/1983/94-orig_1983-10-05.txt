ORAL ARGUMENT OF HUGER SINKLER, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

9
10

MR. SINKLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

South Carolina this morning responds to the

12

leave granted by this Court to argue that this Court

13

take original jurisdiction to dispose of the case which

14

it seeks to bring against the Secretary of the Treasury.

15

Since its inception, South Carolina has been

16

joined by perhaps some 27 states, and for that reason,

17

we move before this Court — The Court granted permission

18

to divide argument and I, thus, will yield ten minutes

19

of my argument to the Assistant Attorney General from

20

Texas.

21

to the states on account of this provision in the law.

22

She will stress the financial burdens that result

The Solicitor General has suggested in his

23

brief — I think it was in a footnote — that since

24

this case so clearly lacks merit that the Court dismiss

25

and grant him the relief.

I think that necessitates

1

comment on the true issues are involved here.

2

This case really has a historic background.

3

In 1894, Congress inacted an Income Tax Law which was

4

broad and widesweeping.

5

the interest on notes and bonds of whatever nature,

6

except those bonds of the United States which, by the

7

terms of their issuance, were exempt from taxation.

8
9
10

11

It included a provision taxing

That produced the famous litigation of Pollock
against Farmers' Loan and Trust Company which was twice
heard by this Court.
At all times, it was unanimous that the very

12

nature of the federal system prevented the imposition

13

of the tax on the interest on state bonds.

14

because of its holding with respect to the lack of power

15

to impose an excise tax on interest and dividends and

16

rents, the law was declared — which had been declared

17

unconstitutional by five to four in Pollock, really

18

resulted in the adoption of the 16th Amendment.

However,

19

Now,- from the time of Pollock until 1982,

20

with the enactment of TEFRA, Congress had conceded,

21

although it was done originally by Mr. Cordell Hull

22

as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in 1913,

23

the fact that interest on state bonds was immune from

24

taxation, but in TEFRA we see a direct challenge.

25

And, meanwhile the Court, while never having precisely

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

this question before it, repeatedly said time after

2

time that the doctrine of reciprocal immunity, which

3

was essential to the federal system, resulted in the

4

freedom from taxation of interest on state bonds.

5

That lasted until 1982 when TEFRA challenges

6

both the meaning of the 16th Amendment, as has been

7

announced by this Court, although technically, I suppose,

8

those pronouncements are dicta.

9

so many times they seemed to work themselves into the

They were pronounced

10

body and tradition of the law.

11

challenged — Must further argue that the 16th Amendment

12

permits this tax.

13

And, they have further

We don't think it does.

The Solicitor General has urged that this

14

Court should not take jurisdiction of this case despite

15

the fact that the second clause of the second section

16

of Article III of the Constitution specifically grants

17

to this Court original jurisdiction in actions which

18

involve a state and a citizen of another state.

19

What we are doing here, of course, is to seek

20

an injunction against the Secretary of the Treasurer

21

in the traditional fashion of enjoining an officer of

22

the United States for performing — acting under an

23

unconstitutional statute, and, thus, performing an

24

illegal act.

25

this Court in the same way.

I think Marbury against Madison got into

QUESTION:

Mr. Sinkler, can I ask you one

question?

3

MR. SINKLER:

4

QUESTION:

Surely.

You have left the merits and are

5

going to the injunction act.

6

Congress have the power to pass a statute that said

7

all bonds traded in the interstate market must be in

8

registered form, including those issued by a state,

9

without any taxation as a penalty?

10

MR. SINKLER:

In your uview, would

I don't think they do.

I think

11

that is an envasion of the state's right.

12

in that case you might get yourself — Your determination

13

might rest on a balancing of equities as has been

14

traditional where the commerce clause is involved. Whereas

15

here, where the taxation clause power is~ involved, what you

16

really have here is a question of reciprocal immunity,

17

one that really goes to the very nature of the federal

18

system.

19

QUESTION:

I think maybe

But, that would be a lesser burder

20

or a greater burden on the state than the one they

21

have now because you can avoid the tax by selling —

22
23

MR. SINKLER:

I think we meet both burdens,

sir.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SINKLER:

You do?
I think we can meet both burdens

million of bonds on September 13 which we will deliver

3

in New York next week.

4

services on an issue of $65 million — I think we have

5

had some before and we figure it to be about $85,000.

6

The cost of paying registered — of issuing registered

7

bonds.

8

cost of arranging for their transfers and arranging

9

for checks to go out, we have an estimate from the Morgan

For instance, South Carolina sold $65

We normally pay for paying agent

Now, they are not so terribly expensive.

The

10

Bank, which is our fiscal agent and bond registrar,

11

that the cost of this issue, which has an average life

12

to 11 years and extends to 00, will be $385,000.

13

Carolina — which is an additional cost of, oh, I think

14

it is $310,000.

15

South

It happens that South Carolina has approximately

16

a debt of about $600 million and the state treasurer

17

has structured that debt on a short-term basis so he

18

will able to come back to the trough more frequently.

19

Well, if you just — assuming it was $650

20

million, you really have added costs in the neighborhood

21

of over $3 million.

22

QUESTION:

That is a good deal of money.
Are you saying the federal government

23

may not impose any regulation on the issuance of bonds

24

that imposes any cost on the state?

25

to be printed in English and have certain disclosures

You say they require

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

and the like?

2

MR. SINKLER:

I think what you really do —

3

I don't think the federal government, if we are going

4

to have the traditional federal system, which is espoused

5

really as far back as Weston against the City of

6

Charleston, in which they said at that time that the

7

doctrine of immunities springs from the very union of

8

the states and the national government.

9

can also justify that under the Supremacy Act which,

I realize you

10

I think, several members of this Court have made that

11

statement.

12

far as the reciprocal immunity which, is granted to the

13

states that results from the nature of the compact.

14
15
16

I have no quarrel with that, but certainly as

There is no provision in the Constitution of the United
States to that effect.
As a matter of fact, the case, of course,

17

went through the South Carolina constitutional court

18

and by a four to three decision the majority said there

19

is nothing in the Constitution of the United States

20

which says we can't do this.

21

The dissenting judges said the very nature

22

of the system makes it impossible for the state to tax

23

the obligation of the federal

24

do so — and I thought the interest rate comment was

25

marvelous — even though Congress provide that the money

government, because to

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

be lent at ten percent, if the states can tax it, the

2

Treasury of the United States will be powerless to borrow.

3

And, that is — See, the burden takes place,

4

according to Chief Justice Marshall, the very existence

5

of it creates a burden on the contract which has a

6

sensible impact on the interest of the — influence

7

on the contract itself.

8

And, furthermore, when one government can

9

control the provisions, the actions of another govern­

10

ment, then you obviously have that type of governmental

11

interference which I personally believe the federal

12

system precludes.

13

QUESTION:

Of course, the doctrine of inter­

14

governmental immunity kind of reached a high point in

15

the 1870's or 1880's and then some of this Court's cases

16

in the 30's rather drastically cut back on this,

17

especially where states are concerned.

18

MR. SINKLER:

I think you did, but I think

19

you have got good distinction.

20

the most famous of all the people who were really

21

affected by this case, Chief Justice Hughes, who in

22

Wilcutts against Bunn, reaffirms and points out that

23

the difference between the imposing of tax on capital

24

gains and on the interest on bonds is that one trans­

25

action — The transaction between the state and its

Take, for instance,

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

lender has been finished and that is a totally new trans­

2

action which results in part from the acumen of the

3

person who bought the bonds.

4
5

6

QUESTION:

Did that case involve intergovern­

mental immunities?
MR. SINKLER:

He quotes Weston and reaffirms

7

everything I said.

8

the great debate with his message — As governor with

9

his message to the General Assembly of New York in

Of course, Governor Hughes started

10

January of 1910 and that produced the language and the

11

16th Amendment came into focus.

12

debate which was joined in by Senator Bora, by Senator

13

Ellihue Root, and President Taft himself, on the basis

14

of the apparent success in persuading the public, the

15

16th Amendment was adopted.

16

There was this great

Hughes twice took a curtain call on the scene.

17

He was a Justice in the case of Brushaber against Union

18

Pracific, the first case following the adoption of the

19

16th Amendment', which held that it merely sought to

20

accomplish that which Pollock denied, the right to tax

21

rents, interest, and income.

22
23
24
25

Hughes, of course, writing Willcutts against
Bunns as Chief Justice, reaffirms all of that.
QUESTION:

What about federal taxation and

the salaries of state employees?

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

MR. SINKLER:

Well, there the taxes paid by

2

the individual employee — It is a nondiscriminatory

3

tax so widespread that it does not affect — This

4

honorable Court has held that it does not affect —

5

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose it might increase

6 the state's cost of its labor force.

MR. SINKLER:

I think it probably might but

8 that is an incidental cost that this Court saw fit to

declare —
QUESTION:

Suppose the government, instead

11

of speaking about registered bonds, just subjected to

12

income taxation all of the interest on all state bonds?

13

MR. SINKLER:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Well, if you do that —

And, of course, that tax would

be paid by the holders of the bonds.
MR. SINKLER:

Let me suggest to you some of

17

the — The taxes paid by the state itself, the fact

18

that there can be a tax makes the state pay the tax.

Now, when we sold these bonds, we had no choice

been ridiculous.

That would have

We couldn't get a market on that.

22 We obviously had to sell fully registered bonds.
23

I did provide the proceedings that if this

24

litigation resulted they way I hope it would, we might

25

later issue coupon bonds, but from a practical standpoint,

We paid 8.1.

6

I think the difference in cost to

I think it would run to perhaps 11.

IBM is obviously more —

QUESTION:

So you think South Carolina is

7

paying an increased interest, the equivalent of the

8

tax burden on the holder?

9

MR. SINKLER:

Yes, we pay it.

We obviously

10

pay.

11

demand otherwise.

12

They are looking for the net interest cost.

13

all very carefully calculated.

I

There is no question about it.

The market would

People don't buy such state bonds.
That is

Now, this TEFRA also put in a provision which

15

limited the deduction that banks might take for borrowed

16

money, and I suppose all bank money is borrowed money.

17

When they came to calculate their income tax, it included

18

15% of the tax-exempt interest.

19

Now,- that is not challenged, because I think

20

the Court could levy a tax without — The Congress could

21

levy a tax without any exemptions.

22

a totally different situation.

23

I think that is

But, immediately after that 15% went into

24

effect, rates were adjusted by major banks so that they

25

ended up by the issue of paying that additional tax.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN LEE VOSS, ESQ.

8

AS AMICI CURIAE

9
10

Ms. Voss?

MS. VOSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

An immeasurable and heavy financial burden

12

has been put on the key sovereign operations of the

13

states by the enactment of this particular section of

14

TEFRA against a dubious benefit to treasury, enforcing

15

the prevention of tax evasion.

16

Moreover, the Solicitor General has suggested

17

in his brief that tax exemption of municipal bonds as

18

a matter of constitutional right is a debatable proposition.

19

My portion of this argument will try to show

20

the financial consequences of the effects of those two

21

propositions and why this appeal to the Court's original

22

jurisdiction is necessary for the protection of the

23

states.

24
25

QUESTION:

Ms. Voss, there are many things

the federal government does by way of congressional

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

or regulatory requirements that end up costing states

2

a lot of money.

3

support your argument?

4

So, how does the financial burden alone

MS. VOSS:

This particular financial burden

5

goes to the basic premise in the Constitution of

6

federalism, something which has been guaranteed to the

7

states since constitution law,started.

You can trace it back

8 to McCullough versus Maryland if you wanted to.
9

But, each day this law is in effect — In

10

Texas alone, you have at least one issuer going to market,

11

paying somewhere between $5,000 and $14,000 in registrar

12

fees that they didn't have to pay before a year.

13

you are talking of each one of 3,395 Texas issuers goes

14

to market one time, about $17 million annually in

15

additional registrar costs.

16

issuers did not have to bear before.

17

47,000 municipal issuers in this country.

Now,

These are costs that these
There are about

18

And, those registrar costs hit the little

19

issuers a lot harder than they hit the big issuers.

20 One of the big guys ’like the University of Texas that
21

doesn't really usually go to market for less than $20

22

million at a time is going to pay lower registrar fees

23

than some little school district that can barely issue

24

on its tax base maybe $1 million to renovate a 60-year

25

old schoolhouse.

And those figures only represent the

burden alone.

It is a financial burden that is going

You are talking about a jail.

As many of

16

you probably know, Texas probably has five inmates to

a cell that was meant to hold two and is under federal

court order to improve conditions.

QUESTION:

General Voss, could I ask you, —

20

MS. VOSS:

Yes.

21

QUESTION:

— supposing the federal government

22

were to have regulations with the kind of disclosures

23

a borrower has to make when it issues bonds and they

24

say you have to file a registration statement and tell

25

where you are financially solvent and all that sort

of thing which is costly to hire accountants to prepare

2

the statement.

3
4

Could they require a state issuer to comply
with rules of that kind do you think?

5

MS. VOSS:

As as a matter of marketing bonds,

6

state issuers presently comply with those sorts of re­

7

quirements .

8
9

QUESTION:

No, but assume — Could the federal

government compel them to, and, say, could they change

10

those to make them more burdensome without violating

12

MS. VOSS:

That particular issue has never

13

been challenged as to its constitutionality.

14

have been complying with it as a marketing matter and

15

I have serious questions as to its constitutionality.

16

QUESTION:

The states

It seems to me your argument would

17

apply to that as well.

18

there is no power in the federal government to impose

19

any burden whatsoever upon a state issuing bonds which

20

is a rather extreme position.

21

I take it?

You are basically arguing that

But, that is your position,

22

MS. VOSS:

23

When you have something like the jail renova­

Yes, sir.

24

tions which are required to be done and there is no

25

money to do them because you had to replace a school

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

that burned down and you had increased cost of issuance

2

on those bonds —

3

because you knew you needed the fire house over there,

4

but you didn't have money for that, because you had

5

more cost of issuance on the sewage treatment plant.

6

You are talking about serious problems with that.

7

Probably the school burned down

And, as to the removal of the income tax exemption

8

altogether, you are going to foreclose many issuers from

9

the market place completely.

The only attraction that

10

their paper has in the market place right now is that

11

tax-exempt feature.

12

QUESTION:

Of course, we don't have to decide

13

that in this case, do we, whether or not the federal

14

government has the power to tax the income from muni­

15

cipal bonds?

16

MS. VOSS:

17

South Carolina has made an appropriate call

No, that is not before you, sir.

18

as the real party in interest to the jurisdiction of

19

this Court a^constitutionally provided and it is simply

20

inconceivable that an act of Congress could deprive

21

the state of that forum, particularly with the financial

22

burden to our governmental functions that this law has

23

created.

24
25

I submit that this is as appropriate case
for this Court's original jurisdiction.

the merits.
If the Court concludes, contrary to our sub­

12

mission, that the Anti-Injunction Act is not a barrier,

13

we are not reluctant to meet South Carolina's con­

14

stitutional challenge.

15

And, while this Court is not required to hear

16

the case, the Secretary is content that the merits be

17

decided here.

18

Indeed, we submit, as has been said, that

19

the constitutionality of the statute is sufficiently

20

clear that the Court could properly dispose of the case

21

at this stage on this motion for leave to file.

22

After all, what is — And, all that is involved

23

here is an indirect — is only indirect requirement

24

that all obligations which extend for more than a year,

25

no matter by whom issued, whether by the United States,

by corporations, by states and municipalities, if issued

2

to the general public, shall be in registered form.

3

Now, this is in no sense discriminatory.

4

It is only the mildest intrusion on states' sovereignty.

5

It seems to us far less so than the requirements sus­

tained, for instance, for withholding income tax from state

employees.

QUESTION:

What is the government's interest,

Mr. Claiborne?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Congress determined, on the

11

basis of elaborate hearings and evidence before it,

12

that there are bonds where one common means, device,

13

for avoiding gift tax, estate tax, capital gains tax

14

on the exchange of those bonds, that is was moreover

15

a haven for illegally obtained monies and finally its

16

right to add that theft and interstate transportation

17

of stolen securities is facilititated when bonds are

18

in bearer rather than registered form.

19

Those considerations, all of which bear on

20

plain powers of Congress inferred by Article I, fully

21

justify the federal interest in enacting this statute.

22

QUESTION:

Since I am old enough to remember

23

when registered bonds were rather frequently encountered,

24

they disappeared over the years.

25

be much federal government interest in getting to the

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Quite candidly, Justice Blackmun,

this is not a revenue agency matter.

aspect.

it is necessary and proper means to attempt to diminish

6

tax evasion and tax avoidance.

an exercise of the taxing power.

8
9
10

It has a revenue

It is an exercise of the taxing power in that

In that sense, it is

But, the object of the exercise is not to
raise additional taxes.
QUESTION:

Except that the government — the

11

Congress retreat from the withholding of interest and

12

dividends that makes this argument sound rather hollow,

13

doesn't it?

14

MR. CLAIBORNE:

It may be that there is some

15

tension between those two contradictory actions of the

16

Congress, but we are here defending that portion of

17

the legislation which did pass and which, to some degree

18

at least, avoids what is otherwise determined to be

19

a common way of avoiding, as I say, both gift and estate

20

taxes and also capital gains taxes.

21

Now, the burden imposed on the states as a

22

result of this is surely less than the burden imposed

23

by many other federal regulations, including the one

24

i have just mentioned, the requirement of withholding.

25

And, as to the costs, the additional costs

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

imposed on the states, we have not attempted to produce

2

counter affidavits, but it is fair to surmise that there

3

would be offsetting economies in the area of insurance

4

and handling, and, of course, the statute does not require

5

that the bonds, though issued in registered form, be

6

issued through certificates.

7

QUESTION:

If the burden is a factual matter,

8

you are suggesting that we ought to surmise that there

9

would be offsetting benefits really doesn't dispense

10

with the necessity of some sort of an inquiry if a there

11

is a factual — if the factual question of burden should

12

play a part in deciding the case.

13

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Quite so, Justice Rehnquist,

14

though I take Justice O'Connor's point that the exact

15

degree of the burden is not constitutionally relevant

16

so long as there is a plain excerise of the power Congress

17

under Article I and even, accepting the allegations

18

of the plaintiff .states, no impermissible burden imposed

19

on the power Of the State of South Carolina or any other

20

to raise revenues.

21

This is simply a question of what form of

22

revenue shall be raised.

23

the interest on all state and municipal bonds.

24

of course, it is in no sense a prohibition or inhibition

25

on the states' power to raise monies.

It is not an attempt to tax
And,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

We would answer Justice Stevens' question,

2

whether if this statute were not in the form of a tax,

3

but was simply a uniform requirement imposed on all

4

issuers of all obligations of a certain character, that

5

they be in registered form.

6

in the same way that we do this one.

QUESTION:

We would defend that statute

Mr. Claiborne, may I ask, if our

8

decision is to grant the motion for leave to file, would

9

it be necessary to appoint a special master?

10

MR. CLAIBORNE:

We would say not and we would

11

say not for the reasons I have suggested in invoking

12

Justice O'Connor's comment.

13

It may be that the Court will feel that the

14

degree of the burden, as Justice Rehnquist suggests,

15

is a matter which — and the question of whether there

18

are, indeed, offsetting economies, is one that appro­

17

priately requires the hearing of evidence, in which

18

event a master —7

that need be made?

QUESTION:

10

11

Justice Powell, we would say

We so allege.

Yes.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

We do not think it is necessary

for the Court to reach that question in this case.

12

QUESTION:

But, is there a limiting principle,

13

and, if so, where is it?

14

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, if contrary to our position,

15

the United States cannot deny exemption to state and

16

municipal obligations altogether, then there must be

17

a limit.

18

limit since it doesn't deny the exemption to all registered

19

bonds and merely requires that in order to earn the

20

exemptions the bonds be issued in that in that form.

21

22

24
25

We would say that this doesn't approach that

QUESTION:

But, that is a matter —

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Which is a traditional form.

It is not an exceptional requirement.
QUESTION:

Could the federal government do

what it has done to the rest of the public and that

2

municipal securities and gradually move it up?

3

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Justice Powell, I haven't

4

had an opportunity to consider that question.

5

suppose that the power to tax when abused amounts to

6

destroying the states' — how to raise revenue, but

7

this Court has said we sit here to assure that that

8

limit is not reached.

QUESTION:

I would

What that limit is —
The power to tax is not limited

by the 10th Amendment?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

The power to tax may be limited,

but it is not eliminated by the 10th Amendment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, you don't concede

14

that this is a tax on the state, do you?

15

on the bond holders.

It is a tax

16

MR. CLAIBORNE:

17

I am assuming, for the purpose of answering

18

Justice Powell, that the state's immunity does run to

19

the bond holder, otherwise, there is no question of

20

a limitation.

It is a tax on the bond interest.

21

Now, we have invoked jurisdictional barriers

22

to this Court's entertaining the case and we have done

23

so because we deemed it our duty to bring to the Court's

24

attention what seemed to us plain obstacles to reaching

25

the merits in this case.

It is principle that no court

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

should decide that which it lacks jurisdiction to decide

principle of more importance than th.e result in any

the Court system.

And, in this instance, it is important for
the government's interest.

It is important for the maintenance of

It is familiar that few things are more
salutary to our tax system than the rule embodied in

statute for over a hundred years that no suit will lie

11

to enjoin the collection of taxes.

12

states — I don't know whether it be true or not with

13

respect to South Carolina and Texas, but it is the general

14

rule in most states that they have a light rule with

15

the resepct to enjoining of the collection of their

16

own taxes.

17

QUESTION:

And, indeed, most

Mr. Claiborne, is your position

18

about the power of Congress to limit the Court's juris­

19

diction somewhat contrary to Marbury versus Madison?

20

MR. CLAIBORNE:

We, Justice O'Connor, do not

21

view it as a contradiction with the dictum in Marbury

22

verus Madison because it seems to us that this is simply

23

a procedural limitation on when this Court, as any other

24

court, may entertain an action of this kind.

25

It is common ground, I take it, that a statute

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

of limitations governs this Court in the exercise of

2

its original jurisdiction as it governs every other

3

court.

4

QUESTION:

Can the Congress limit the remedies

5

that this Court can provide in the exercise of its

6

jurisdiction, its original jurisdiction?

7

MR. CLAIBORNE:

We would say, yes, Justice

8

O'Connor, that at least so long as the rule is uniform

9

and non-discriminatory against the Court and it is simply

10

a rule of procedure which announces when an injunction

11

is appropriate.

12

For instance —

13

QUESTION:

By that argument, can Congress

14

limit the term in which this Court can sit or estab­

15

lish filing fees that would determine what cases could

16

be taken?

17

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Not what cases could be taken

18

in terms of classes of cases.

19

Congress does'set the tone of this Court by statute.

20

But, I assume there are limits there.

21

the Congress could say this Court shall not sit for

22

two years.

23

My impression is that

I don't suppose

I assume, on the other hand, that it is

24

permissible, as is present law, that the Congress may

25

say that the Court shall begin its new term on the first

Monday in October.
QUESTION:

If you were correct on the juris­

3

dictional part, is there any way at all that South Carolina

4

could get a hearing on its question in any court?

5

MR. CLAIBORNE:

It is not we who are preventing

6

South Carolina from testing the issue by issuing their

7

bonds, albeit it may be that those bonds may have to

8

be issued in order to find purchasers at an abnormally

9

high rate of interest.

10

But, if they wish to press the matter, that

11

is obviously an available way in which it can be done.

12

It need not be a large issue.

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Well, then, the purchaser himself

would have to file a suit, not South Carolina.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed.

But, there is no

10

bar to the purchaser either challenging the deficiency

17

in the Tax Court if he has failed to pay his interest

18

on that issue of the bonds he holds or by refund suit

19

in the District Court or the Claims Court.

20

But, whether or not there will, at the end

21

of the day's practical matter, be an occasion to test

22

the constitutionality of this statute is no reason why

23

no other court can presently entertain this suit.

24
25

This Court ought to be driven to take juris­
diction; that is, it seems to us, entirely backwards.

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Congress has, in the interest of sparing this

2

Court's burdened docket, given concurrent jurisdiction

3

in a case of this kind to the District Courts and what

4

South Carolina would suggest is that because the anti­

5

injunction statute bars the District Court from enter­

6

taining the suit, it out to be bounced back to this

7

Court, the Court of all Courts, which ought to be less

8

hospitable to litigation than the District Courts whose

9

primary role is to entertain original cases.

10

QUESTION:

Well, that goes to the proper use

11

of the discretion of this Court, whether to accept it

12

or not, don't you think?

13

this Court cannot accept it.

14

You are arguing instead that

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Justice O'Connor, I argue

imposed by statute of limitations, just like the legis­

18

lative bar imposed by the Norris-LaGuardia Act which,

19

in turn, supplied to all the courts of the United States,

20

which this is one, does apply here, and, hence, if it

21

prevents the District Court from hearing the case,

22

likewise prevents this Court from doing so.

23

I say that the legislative bar imposed by the

This Court, however, may choose not to deter­

24

mine that issue and may, as a matter of its own

25

discretion with an eye to the congressional policy,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

determine that it is inappropriate for this Court to

2

do the business which other courts have been prevented

3

from doing in obedience to a legislative policy of such

4

longstanding and with such obvious salutary reasons

5

behind it.

6

And, therefore, as a matter of discretion,

7

if not as a matter of necessity, this Court ought to

8

decline to entertain the action.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, have you considered

10

the case of Allen against the Regents of the University

11

of Georgia in connection with your argument, whether

12

that isn't a response that you ought to deal with?

13

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Justice Stevens, I am aware

14

of that case and it is very relevant to the present

15

case.

16

was dealt with by this Court's opinion in the Bob Jones

17

case indicates that in the Court's view it is no longer

18

good law any more than the case on which it was based,

19

the Beechnut case which had, in the Court's terms,

20

eroded, if not scuttled, the Anti-Injunction Act.

21

I take it, however, that the way in which it

In Allen, which was a five to three decision

22

on this point, the Court felt constrained to allow,

23

not as an original suit, to concede that the anti­

24

injunction action there did not bar a suit to challenge

25

the requirement that the University collect amusement

2

be very comparable to this case.

3

And, that may­

But, it does seem to us that that was a

4

circumvention of the anti-injunction statute and, more

5

importantly, it seems to us that the Court has so treated

6

in its now current opinion in Bob Jones University verus

7

Simon, and, indeed, in the companion case.

8

The argument the other way was put as eloquently
S

9

as could be in the Americans United case by the dis­

10

senting opinion of Justice Blackmun and — But, that

11

view did not prevail and it seems to us that that view

12

is precisely the view of what had been embraced by the

13

Court in the Allen case.

14

Let me say one final thing with respect to

15

the question of Marbury versus Madison and our argument

16

seeming in contradiction with it.

17

Marbury versus Madison, of course, holds that

18

the Congress cannot add to the Court's original juris­

19

diction, and,-indeed, an argument could be made that,

20

therefore, invoking the Declaratory Judgment Act here would be

21

adding to the jurisdiction of this Court in some sense.

22

We would not make that argument.

23

the same vein, we would not hear say that the anti­

24

injunction action, statute, takes away from the Court's

25

jurisdiction.

And, in

It simply instructs all courts of the

United States when they may hear a controversy, not

what controversies they may hear.
And, it cannot be different, whether the rule

is that it is too late to hear it, as in the case of

5

the statute of limitations, or too soon to hear it.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Claiborne, how could the Court

7

ever hear on appeal a case to which South Carolina was

8

a party in connection with this task if we can't hear

9

it here?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

10

There could be no such case

11

in which South Carolina was plaintiff, but that is often

12

true.

13

The reason South Carolina —
QUESTION:

Well, you are then saying that

14

South Carolina could never have an adjudication in this

Court at its instance.

16

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, with respect to this

17

particular issue, I think that is so.

18

of course, need not sit and tarry on the sidelines when

19

the taxpayer files his refund suit.

20

QUESTION:

South Carolina,

If the taxpayer ever does.

As

21

a taxpyer', he is going to be getting higher interest

22

rates, what has he got at stake?

23

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, he would just as soon

24

pocket all that higher interest rate rather than pay

25

half of it to the Treasury.

than he ever did.

out of its bonds.

5

Only South Carolina is getting less

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, it may be, and this

6

is precisely the argument that Justice Blackmun made

7

in Americans United, that such a suit might never come

8

about because the organization, among other things,

9

might change its activity or because the contributor

10

wouldn't find it worthwhile hiring a lawyer and going

11

through the cost and delays of filing a suit to which

12

the Court said that is no reason to break the rule of

13

the anti-injunction statute.

14
15
10

QUESTION:

Well, the state is a party here.

That wasn't involved in the Bob Jones case.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I appreciate that the state

17

has a claim and that the state is different from an

18

ordinary party.

19

Of. course, with respect to ordinary taxpayers,

20

it must happen every day; that people who would engage

21

in a certain commercial transaction, if they were assured

22

of the tax consequences, but not being able to obtain

23

a declaration from a court in advance and not being

24

able to obtain a favorable revenue ruling, simply demur

25

and do not engage in that transaction and the matter

Is there now a withholding on

interest on bonds issued by private issuers?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

My impression is that that

statute was repealed and is not presently the law.

So that South Carolina, if it —

would be under no obligation now to file any withholding

statements or to report to the government how much

recent amicus brief filed, and I am not confident whether

21

the Court has granted leave to file it, but suggests

22

that the alternative to this statute is a requirement

23

that the issuer's paying agent report to whom the bearer

24

bonds have been delivered, keep records of any payments

25

of interest and thereby furnish a trail for the federal

Revenue officers to satisfy themselves that there has

2

been no attempted avoidance or evasion of tax.

3

I am frankly baffled about what is different

4

about conceding that those requirements would be proper

5

and challenging this more straightforward requirement

6

that the bonds be issued in registered form as an issue.

7

We submit that the Court ought not grant leave

8

to file because, as a matter of the anti-injunction

9

statute applicable here as well as elsewhere, the Court

10

cannot entertain the suit.

QUESTION:

12

MR. CLAIBORNE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CLAIBORNE:

It should not —

Mr. Claiborne — I am sorry.

Finish your sentence.
But that if the merits are

15

appropriately reached, they are sufficiently clear that

16

the suit should be dismissed at this stage.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, I just wanted to

18

go back for a moment to the Allen case again and be

19

sure I understand your submission, because as I glance

20

again at the opinion, the Court did, in that case, rely

21

to some extent on the fact that you -- a state had interest

22

involved, the University of Georgia, the Board of Regents

23

of the University of Georgia was speaking on behalf

24

of the state, and to the extent that you rely on Bob

25

Jones as in effect repudiating the rationale of that

case, it really couldn't repudiate that aspect of the

2 case.

So, maybe it at least survived when the person

3

seeking to bring the litigation is the state as opposed

4

to a private university or something like that.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, I perhaps missed the

8 passage Your Honor refers to in the Allen case.
7

I had

not appreciated that the Court felt that because it

8 was state rather than an ordinary taxpayer the anti­
9

injunction statute prohibition ought to be relaxed.

10
11

QUESTION:

That was the fact though in the

case.

12

MR. CLAIBORNE:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

It was indeed.

And, I may read too much into it.

It isn't as clear as it might be.

I am not suggesting

you misread it.

16

But, that is really your response to the case /

17

to that case is almost exclusively that Bob Jones has

18

undermined it?

19

20

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, that case was wrongly

decided as Bob Jones indicates.

21

QUESTION:

The reasoning of Allen is totally

22

inconsistent with the reasoning of Bob Jones, isn't

23

it?

24
25

MR. CLAIBORNE:
Rehnquist.

Well, exactly so, Justice

I cannot reconcile them and I don't think

this Court attempted to do so in Simon.

2

clearly repudiated the case on which Allen is in turn

3

relying and mentioned Allen as simply following in that

4

erroneous view.

5

overruled, I take it its holdings have been effectively

eroded I submit.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HUGER SINKLER, ESQ.

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

11
12

MR. SINKLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, if it please

the Court:

13

I would like to suggest to the Court the con­

14

sequences of permitting the national government to

15

inject itself into the issuance of state bonds.

16

talking about state bonds issued for state purposes.

17

I am not talking about industrial revenue or those type

18

of bonds.

19

I am

If the Congress can tell South Carolina it

20

has got to issue revenue bonds, then it can tell South

21

Carolina that it can only issue bonds of a certain kind

22

or if it issues those bonds, it must issue a different

23

kind of bond.

24

of government from the local capitals to Washington,

25

because if you just look at the Internal Revenue Act,

You are really going to move the seat

sort of esoteric type of borrowing.

pages and hundreds of pages of regulations.

what you are going to have if you once let the camel

5

put his nose under the tent and tell states when they

6

should or should not issue bonds or how they should

7

issue bonds.

That is

I am talking about state bonds for state

You now find 15

public purposes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Sinkler, may I ask — I don't

11

think you have suggested a response to the government's

12

argument.

13

jurisdiction of this suit.

The Tax Injunction Act bars this Court's

14

MR. SINKLER:

15

QUESTION:

Excuse me, sir?

I don't think you have addressed

16

the government's argument, have you, that the Tax

17

Injunction Act bars this Court's jurisdiction of this

18

suit?
MR..SINKLER:

19

Well, in the first place, Your

20

Honor, I think that this case involves something a great

21

deal more' than a tax.

22

committee reports as a sanction, not a tax, this pro­

23

vision.

24
25

This is referred to in the joint

But, this is a matter where this Court should
take jurisdiction, because this case really involves

the right of the national government to impose its will

upon the governments of the states.

question.

It is a fundamental

Also, he has boldly announced — I didn't

4
5

think he was going to boldly announced, I thought he

6

would try to get away from it — that the 16th Amendment

7

prevents federal government to tax state bonds which

8

overrules certainly the dicta of this Court for 60 years.
MR. SINKLER:

9

Now, Mr. Sinkler, if we do grant

10

your motion for leave to file, should we appoint a special

11

master?
MR. SINKLER:

12

Not at all, sir.

13

are here, the facts are here.

14

intrusion.

15

QUESTION:

The basic question is

Well, what if we agree with you?

16

What should we do at this juncture?

17

leave to file yet.

18
19

MR. SINKLER:
file our motion.
QUESTION:

21

MR. SINKLER:

22

further argument I would assume.

24
25

We haven't granted

I think you ought to let us

The facts

QUESTION:

Then what?
And fight for the briefs and

You mean you have some arguments

on the merits you haven't presented now?
MR. SINKLER:

I think there are a considerable

number of arguments.

I think this Court would find itself

2

interested in the history of the whole problem, because

3

case really goes _—

4

QUESTION:

But, if you are going to do that,

5

why wouldn't you want the opportunity to support some

6

of your factual obligations about the burdens on the

7

state and maybe the federal government would want to —
MR. SINKLER:

8
9

I would have no objection to

that.
QUESTION:

10

— have testimony with respect

11

to what kind of a basis there is for requiring registered

12

bonds.

13
14
15

MR. SINKLER:

We certainly would have no

objection to it, Your Honor.
There happens to be about a half trillion

16

dollars of coupon bonds outstanding now that are not

17

covered by this thing.

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

19

MR.-SINKLER:

So that the result the government

20

seeks is not going to come about probably for a great

21

many year's.

22
23

QUESTION:

Mr. Sinkler, you have asked for

a preliminary injunction, I thought.

24

MR. SINKLER:

25

QUESTION:

I was denied that, Your Honor.

So that is out of the case?

QUESTION:

You can renew the motion right

now, I suppose.

You will take it with or without

MR. SINKLER:

That is right, sir.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
We will hear arguments next in Russello
