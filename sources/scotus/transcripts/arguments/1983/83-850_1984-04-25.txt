ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FREY:

ESQ.,

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court, this case is here cn writ cf

Tenth Circuit.

the beeper.

Now, the case began when DEA agents

16

investigating drug manufacturing activities in

17

Albuquerque, New Mexico, through a course of

18

investigation discovered that a gentleman named Carl

19

Muehlanweg was acting as a front to acquire chemicals

20

for certain illicit drug manufacturing operations, and

21

they searched Muehlenweg’s premises, and Muehlenweg

22

agreed to cooperate with them in further

23

investigations.

24

And some time thereafter he advised them that

25

certain individuals had through him placed an order for

extracting cocaine from clothing.

The agents with the

This was picked up by respondent Karo, who was
followed by visual and beeper surveillance to his

10

house.

11

from the area of Karo's house, tut the container or the

12

beeper signal, at least, was located at respondent

13

Horton's house, and the agents identified the general

14

vicinity with the beeper and then walked by the outside

15

of Horton's house and were able to smell the ether

16

emanating from somewhere on the property.

later that day the signal was no longer coming

QUESTION:

Let me back you up a moment, Mr.

18

Frey.

When the device, the beeper, as you call it, was

19

placed in the drum , was it placed with the consent cf

20

the owner cf that drum?
MR. FREY:

21

It was placed with the consent cf

22

the owner at that time, although cf course it was known

23

that it was going to be delivered to other persons in

24

the future, but at the time there was consent.

event,

In any

whether or not there was consent I don't think

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

would be material here, because the invasion of the drum

2

at that time did not invade any property interest or any

3

privacy interest of any of the respondents, at that

time.

government is very anxious to monitor the movements of a

8

very suspected big criminal and they simply go to the

9

men's clothing store where he shops and with the

Supposing the

10

agreement of the salesperson have a beeper put in

11

13

Now, obviously that is a more extreme
situation than this, but is the logic much different?

14

MR. FREY;

No, I don't think the logic would

15

be much different.

Court of Appeals didn't suggest that there was any

Fourth Amendment violation in the installation by

20

view gave rise to a Fourth Amendment problem.

MR. FREY;

I don't see how without the

It is of no value to you whatsoever.

malfunctioned, and about a week later they got a call

13

from the manager of the storage lockers who said, by the

14

way, these fellows have taken the stuff out of the

15

storage locker.

arrived at the locker in Horton's pickup truck, emptied

out the contents of the locker, drove to the vicinity of

his residence, picked up some other things, and then

miles away, followed by visual and beeper surveillance,

The agents then surveilled this destination.
In this case they used the beeper in the course of their

10

surveillance actually to determine that the containers

11

were inside the residence in Taos, and during their

12

surveillance they saw at one point that all the windows

13

were open, although it was a very cold and windy day,

14

and they knew from that that the ether was actually

15

being put to use.

seized cccaine, marijuana, laboratory equipment, and

other items.

20

Sow, the District Court found that the

21

original order that had been sought to authorize the

22

beeper surveillance was invalid because it had falsely

itself violated the rights of the transferree to be free

from unreasonable searches without a warrant, and that

itself a search if it happens at the time of the

monitoring that the beeper-laden container has beer

Now, I wanted to say a few words about what

19
20

beepers are and their utility in law enforcement, and I

21

thought for the — I know the Court was very curious

22

during the Knotts argument, so I had the DA supply me

23

with a beeper just so that you can see what it looks

24

like.

25

these are batteries.

It is — I understand that it is installed —
This is the transmitter.

And it

bottom cf a container, as in this case.

This is not the beeper that was used in this

case, but it is similar.

smaller, I am told, than the one used in this case.

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, was the beeper actually

evidence in the case?

9

It is actually a little

MR. FREY:

I'm not sure that it was, and I

don't rely on any conclusions.

It is just tc satisfy

10

the curiosity that I thought the Court exhibited during

11

the Knctts argument.

12

All right.

This is an FM radio transmitter.

13

It emits a signal that allows the beeper to be located

14

by the use of appropriately designed receiving

15

equipment.

16

precisely the location of the signal coming from the

17

beeper

unless you get quite close.
There are basically two kinds of uses for

18
19

beepers.

One is attaching them tc vehicles to fellow

20

the vehicles, aircraft, or so on, on the highway, and

21

the second is implanting them in containers, as in this

22

case,

23

in drug investigations, but it could be used with

24

explosives or containers of firearms that are suspected

25

to be exported or other kinds of containers that would

not be likely to be opened and have the beeper revealed

2

premat urely.

3

The essential purpose of the beeper is to

4

facilitate the process of surveillance of the movement

5

of cars, chemicals, or other containers that are

6

suspected tc be involved in illicit activities.

7

Basically it is a substitute for the human eye in

8

following these movements, but it is tremendously

9

valuable both in enabling a surveillance to be conducted

10

effectively with limited personnel resources and in

11

generally reducing the danger that the surveillance will

12

be detected by the suspects.

13

QUESTION:

In this respect, Sr. Frey, when you

14

say it is really just a substitute for the human eye,

15

could this can be taker, out of a house and put in a car

16

in a manner that could not have been visually detected

17

from the sky or from -MR. FREY:

18

plan to get to that when I talk about the question of

20

whether this case is like or unlike Knotts, tut I

21

think

do that, although I think at the end of the conceptual

3

analysis I probably would say that, but here we are

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FREY:

Yes.

17

QUESTION :

Mr. Frey, on this particular point,

I will --

18

I assume that considerable time was made in preparing

19

for this whole thing by the government.

20

MR. FREY:

Yes.

21

QUESTION:

Right?

22

Well, why couldn’t they

some time in that period of time have gotten a warrant?
MR. FREY:

23

Well, they could have, and they

24

did, and the warrant happened to be no good in this

25

case.

I think that our concern, as I hope to explain

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

somewhat later, is net that in this case they couldn't

2

have gotten a warrant.

3

warrant in this case.

4

in this case was that they were concerned about the

5

safety and the secrecy of the informant's status, and

6

they chose what turned out to be an ill-advised means of

7

attempting to protect against the ultimate disclosure.

8

9

QUESTIONi

I mean, they could have gotten a
The problem that fouled their up

You mean they couldn't trust a

federal judge?

10

HE. FREY i

Well, I think their concern, and I

11

think

12

visited, and maybe one day a case will arise about what

13

the appropriate procedures are for protecting the

14

identity of a confidential informant where at some point

15

down the road there is likely to be disclosure to

16

defendants in the event a criminal case comes, for

17

instance, of the contents of an affidavit for a search

18

warran t.

this is a concern which this Court has not

New, I think that probably the procedure that

19
20

should have been used here was to make an accurate

21

description in the search warrant and file it under

22

seal, but at seme point down the road you can be sure

23

that the defendants would have demanded the right to see

24

it.

25

Now, in this particular case, of course,

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Muehlenweg's identity as an informant was disclosed at

2

the suppression hearing, but there is a concern.

3

don't think that the action of the agent and the

4

assistant U.S. Attorney was outrageous in this case,

5

even if in retrospect we can say it was ill-advised, but

6

the real concern about requiring us to get a warrant is

7

not so much that we can't dc it, although I don't think

8

it performs a very useful function, as I will get to

9

later,

but that there are classes of cases in which the

10

use of

the beeper is very important but we don't have

11

probable cause, but only a reasonable suspicion cf

12

criminal activity.

13

So that if you are — the holding that a

14

warrant is required is a holding that beeper

15

surveillance cannot be employed on the basis of

16

reasonable suspicion of criminal activity,

17

is cur practical concern.

QUESTION*

I think that

Mr. Frey, I am still a little

19

confused about the argument.

20

I don't think the action would be a

18

search or a seizure that is regulated by the Fourth

19

Amendment, and I don't think it would have any

evidentiary fruits unless the beeper were listened to,

21

but I certainly agree that if we have to go into

22

somebody's private property for purposes of installing a

beeper , as in the Dalia case where an entry had

I just wanted to make the point before I get

3

back to Justice White's question, which I do want to

4

address, that this case is typical in demonstrating the

5

value of the beeper in illicit drug manufacturing

6

investigations, because people involved in such

7

activities often proceed very cautiously with varicus

8

kinds of countersurveillance activities, which include,
as in this case, moving the containers to seven

10

different locations and delaying their actual --

11

actually putting them to their illicit use for a period

12

13

. of four and a half months.
Now, effective investigation and apprehension

14

in this case would have been as a practical matter

15

impossible even though as a theoretical matter if we

16

were willing to assign

17

period of four and a half months we could have dene it,

18

but with the beeper, a handful of agents who can also do

other things at the sane time are able to conduct an

20

effective investigation which led to the discovery of a

21

serious crime.

Now, I would like to get to the question about

23

whether this is or is not any different from Knotts,

New, the point essentially that we want to

make i s that Knotts established that to use the beeper

MR. FREYi

He is entitled to know that, and he

And if a truck leaves

MR. FREY;

Well, that is all right.

QUESTIONi

Any automobile that leaves, he

doesn’t know whether the can is in it cr net.
MR. FREY:

He may not know without the beeper,

15

but he can follow or agents can follow every one of them

16

until finally one of them arrives at the laboratory site

17

where by other observations they are able tc determine

18

that there is probable cause to conduct a conventional

19

search and to secure a warrant.

20

So, even in these cases, agents stationed

21

outside each of these properties waiting until somebody

22

leaves who might be carrying ten five-gallon cans cf

accomplished by a visual surveillance.

conceptually nothing has changed.

That is, we are still

using the beeper to follow vehicles on the open highway,

and what the Court said in Knotts is the fact that --

was the fact that we are more efficient, even a great

The fact that it is in the house which was so

critical to respondents' argument to the Court of

don't know that it was in the first three houses at

There is no evidence in the record.

16

The only house or even storage locker that we

17

learned it was in by use of the beeper was the ultimate

destination in Taos, and as to that, that piece of

information as to whether it was in or out of the house

if you held that this was a search, because what is
important to us is the ability to use this technique in
circumstances where a chemical company calls us up and
says we have a very suspicious purchase of ether or
chlcrofcrm cr seme chemical precursor from somebody we
don’t know and we are suspicious.
This is probably not probable cause that would
be enough to justify us getting a warrant to search the
house of the person if we followed them to that place
where they took the container, yet it is enough tc
warrant an investigation, and in Adams against Williams
the Court said the policeman shouldn't just shrug his
shoulders and go away, that the only effective means of
investigation in this circumstance, the most effective
means is the use of the beeper.

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

20

please the Court, at the oral argument in this Court’s

21

prior beeper case of United States versus Knotts,

22

Justice C'Ccnncr asked Alexander Frey of the Solicitcr

23

General’s office whether a beeper which pinpointed an

24

object in a barrel inside the premises was a search.

25

said at that time that that was a different case and a

2

Justice C'Connor then pursued her line of

3

questioning to ask if the beeper pinpointed an object

4

within the bedroom cf a house, would that be a search.

5

Mr. Frey said yes.

He didn't say yes.

could be a search.

And that is the case that we have

before us today.

He said, that

the fact that there is no -- that there just really
