CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gottesman,

I think

you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL H. GOTTESMAN, ESQ.,

5

ON EEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

6

ME. GOTTESMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

7 and may it please the Court:
This is a tort action arising under state

8
9

law.

It was in the federal court because of diversity

10

of citizenship.

The occasion for this tort action is

11

that plutonium escaped from a manufacturing plant cf the

2

defendant and that plutonium contaminated Karen Silkwood

3 and her apartment.

And the complaint in this action,

4 resembling complaints that have been filed, I suppose,
5 for time immemorial in the courts of this -- of the
6

states of this nation, sought compensatory damages for

7 both the injury to person and to property and punitive
8 damages for this state law tort.
9

The jury awarded both compensatory and

20

punitive damages.

The court of appeals, the court

2

below, affirmed in part the compensatory damage award

22 and reversed it in part.
23

For all purposes here that —

the rulings on the compensatory damages are not

24 important except that the court rejected an argument of
25

the defendant that compensatory damages were preempted

by the Atomic Energy Act, and in fact held that

2

compensatory damages could be awarded, and in fact

3

affirmed an award of compensatory damages for property

4

damage .
QUESTION;

5

Now, the only compensatory damage

6

award

that remains in the case, as I understand it, is

7

the $5,0C0 property damage award.
SR. GCTTESMAN:

8

remains in the case.
QUESTION:

10

That is the only award that

There is a debate between the —
And the entire $10 million punitive

11

damages has to hang then on the $5,000 property damage,

12

is that correct?
MR. G0TTESKAN:

13
14

Well, at the present -- in the

present posture of the case —

15

QUESTION:

At present?

16

MR. G0TTESMAN;

Yes.

In the present posture

17

of the case, the punitive damage award, if it were not

18

preempted, the court of appeals would have to address,

1

number one, whether that size award can properly be

20

predicated on the property damage award; and number two,

21

if not, whether there should be a remittitor or whether

22

there should be a retrial on the amount of punitive

23

damages.

24
25

QUESTION:

Does Oklahoma law, so far as you

know, as to punitive damages draw any distinction

b et we e n a property damage award and a personal injury

2

awa rd?

4

ME. GOTTESMANi

None, Your Honor.

The courts

have s quarely held that punitive damages may be awarded

5 for pr operty damage alone, or for personal injury alone,
6 or for
7 cases,

both.

The standards are identical in both

And the measure of punitive damages in Oklahoma

8

relate s to the gravity of the harm threatened by the

9

def end ant's reckless or malicious conduct.

So that

10

there have been a number of Oklahoma decisions which

11

have s et aside in part a compensatory damage award and

12

yet st ill affirmed in full the punitive damage award.

13

But in any event, that issue is net here,

14

That i ssue is the next one for the Tenth Circuit to

15

add res s once it’s established that punitive damages are

16 not pr eempted .
17

QUESTION:

Yeah,

Even if you won, it would be

18

rem and ed then to determine whether that damages award is

19

adequa te as premised or -- or excessive — excuse me —

20

excess ive as premised on on ly a £5,000 property —

21

MR. GCTTESMAN:

23

W ell, that issue would be
There is a question whether

Kerr-M cGee has waived the r ight to make that claim

question of whether the award will .sustain the punitive

2 damage award are both for the Tenth Circuit award.
But, of course, the Tenth Circuit never got to

4

those questions because it ruled that punitive damages

5 are absolutely preempted by the Atomic Energy Act in any
6

suit against a nuclear operator relating to exposure to

7 radiation.

And

8 been brought to

9

that, of course, is the issue that has
this Court by us, and there is a

question at the threshold.
The issue was brought to this Court on an

10
11

appeal alleging that the Tenth Circuit by ruling as it

12

did had held invalid the Oklahoma punitive damage

13 statute.
14

This Court has postponed the determination of

jurisdiction, and I do want to spent just a moment

15 explaining why we think, that this in fact is a proper
16 appeal under

1254.2.

17

In Oklahoma punitive damages exist only by

18 statute.

There has been a punitive damage statute since

19

the first territorial legislature of the state.

There

20 has never been a common law of punitive damages.

And

21

that punitive damage statute makes punitive damages

22

available, if, of course, the culpable conduct is

23

present, in any action except a contract action.

24

the Supreme Court of Oklahoma has read those words

And

25 literally and in authoritative decisions has said that
6

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

except for contract actions, punitive damages are

2

available in any action.

3

arguments as to whether it’s a good idea or a bad idea.

4

This is the legislative policy of this state.

We will not entertain

Now, because that is the law of Oklahoma, the

5

6 district court, upon finding that there was evidence to

7 support a verdict, was required to submit the punitive
8 damage issue to the jury and said that it was required
9

to do so.

It submitted it in the words of the statute,

10 and the jury found a violation in reliance on that
11

12

cha rge .
Both parties told the court of appeals that

13

punitive damages in Oklahoma are governed exclusively by

14

this statute.

15

arguments and given an argument by Kerr-ScGee that there

16

was preemption, began its conclusive paragraph,

17

paragraph where it found preemption, saying, "Arguably,

18

there should be a strong presumption against preemption

19

of state laws affecting such vital interests of its

And the court below, given those

the

20 citizens as those involved here."
21

Now, in Oklahoma the only state law that the

22 court could

have been referring to was 23 Oklahoma

23

Statute Section 9.

And though the court did not cite

24

that section by name, having begun that conclusive

25

paragraph saying "Arguably, there are strong arguments
7

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC

1

against preemption of state laws, but nevertheless, we

2 find preemption," we submit that the court has held
3

invalid Section 9 as applied to nuclear operators in

4

radiation cases in the full substance and import of its

5 opinion.
6

We think, indeed, that's what it said, but

7 whether it said it or not, that is certainly the effect
8

of what it did.

And as the Solicitor General

9

acknowledges, appellate jurisdiction exists if the

10

invalidity of the state statute was a necessary

11

predicate for the court of appeals decision, and we

12

think it was.

13

Sow, turning to the issue on the merits, the

14

preemption issue, we're dealing here with a state's

15

right to punish, to punish conduct that injures people

16

and that injures people and is accompanied by a

17 particularly reprehensible state of mind — either the
18

deliberate infliction of injury or the infliction of

19

injury with a reckless disregard for the safety of the

20 state's citizens.
21

Now, this kind of punishment, this civil

22

punishment, if you will, punitive damages, has been a

23

traditional element of the tort law in 46 states of this

24

country and is still in the tort law of 46 states.

25 what it is designed to do lies at the core of the
8

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

And

1

state's interest, that the police power is designed to

2

protect people against reprehensible conduct, very much

3

as the criminal law is.

4

And the question we have here is whether

5

Congress in enacting the Atomic Energy Act intended to

6

deprive the states of this traditional piece of a tort

7

action.

8

9

the answer is wholly one of congressional intent.
We approach that question with certain

starting point for analysis.

Never in the jurisprudence of this nation, not

19

in this Court, not in any other court, has there ever

before been a holding that Congress left compensatory

21

damages unpreemptive and yet preempted the punitive

22

damages in that very same cause of action.

23

QUESTION*

Yet, Mr. Gottesman, the position

24

you take that punitive damages are primarily to punish

25

suggests, at least in your view, that the punitive
9

1

damages serve a much different purpose than compensatory

2 damages, which I suppose are just to make whole.
3
4

MR. GOTTESMAN;

That's correct.

They serve a

different purpose, but the reason that you don't find

5 that kind of selective preemption is that the purpose
6 that they serve, punitive damages, lie absolutely at the
7 core of the state's interest and much more at the
8

periphery of the federal interest.

So that as I'll

9

indicate, as we do in our brief -- and if we have time.

10

I'll get to — it would be much less likely that

11

Congress would make a judgment to preempt punitive

12

damages than compensatory.

13

QUESTION!

Are you suggesting it would be more

14 likely if they had to choose that they would have
15 preempted compensatory damages?
16

KB. CCTTESNAN:

Well, I think it's not likely

17

they would choose to select between them, and indeed,

18

there's never been a ruling by this Court that found one

19 and not the other.
20 alone or it doesn't.

Congress either leaves tort actions

21

about to come to is that Congress has made rather

remarkably clear here an intention to leave state tort

MR . GOTTESMAN;

are regulatory, and this Court has repeatedly so said.

Well, there are some

As to

9 this plant Congress made the judgment we have no
10

interest in impeding the operation cf state tort law at

11

all, as contrasted with a nuclear power plant where

12

Congress has made certain selective judgments to

13 override the state tort law.
14

Now, it’s

15

QUESTION:

Do you think then that, for

16 instance, damages to the public arisina out of a
17

terrorist attack on a nuclear facility would be

18

preempted?

19

MR. GOTTESMANi

Oh, absolutely not.

I would

20

assume that, assuming states can otherwise prosecute

21

terrorists criminally for invading any other plant, they

22

could likewise prosecute them for invading a nuclear

23

power plant.

I shouldn’t think that there would be a

24 question about that.
25

Indeed, I think even the Solicitor

General’s brief concedes you can prosecute everybody but
12

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the corporation itself.

2

Now, however we might derive answers to this

3

logically, the fact is that the determinative question

4

here is what Congress intended and what logic Congress

5

was applying.

6

mere extensive insight into Congress’ views about

And we have the benefit here of a much

7 preemption than we ordinarily have in a preemption case,
8

9

because Congress spoke a lot more about this.
To be sure, as this Court held last term in

10

Pacific Gas and Electric, Congress in enacting the 1954

11

Atomic Energy Act and opening up this industry to the

12

private sector reserved to federal exclusive control

13

regulation, at least in the strictest sensei

14 inspections, that sort of thing.

licensing#

There’s no question

15

that Congress occuppied that field.

16

on the other side of this case embrace the statement

17

that this Court made in PGEE that Congress has occupied

18

the field of regulation, and seek to evolve their entire

19 solution out of

And, indeed, these

that sentence of the opinion.

But it

20

can’t be done, because were that proposition right, it

21

would follow that Congress had preempted compensatory

22 damage remedies as well, which this Court has repeatedly
23
24
25

said are regulatory.
And yet, everybody understands, and this Court
has said in Duke Power and PGEE, that when Congress
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

enacted the 1954 Act, it did net preempt the state's

2 existing rights to entertain tort actions by those who
3

were the victims of radiation injuries.

4

it's precisely because the

And, indeed,

*54 Act did not preempt those

5 tort actions that we got the Price-Anderson Act, because
6

people said we're not going to enter this field; we are

7 afraid

of our potential tort liability.

And so Congress

8

addressed that question of tort liability in the

9

Price-Anderson Act.
Now, Congress in that act did not cede to the

10
11

states the right to entertain tort actions.

12

our adversaries here say.

13

the states the right tc have tort actions.

14

what Price-Anderson did.

15

these tort actions.

16

question here is whether we should put any limitations

17 on them.

That's what

They say Congress ceded to
That's net

Congress said the states have

They have them already.

The

And in that context Congress spoke at length

18

about its view about the state tort action.

19

We have a window to congressional

20 understanding here that is quite unique, and I want to

21

refer just to a few of the statements, and to read them

22

very briefly, that Congress made expressing its views.
The other side says well, never mind what

23
24

Congress said here;

26

they really only meant compensatory

But that wasn’t the congressional mind-set.
14

AUJERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

For example, the Joint Committee report in 1956 -- and

2

this is when the only interference with state tort law

3

that Congress made was to put a $560 million limit of

4 liability for certain operators, not for Kerr-KcGee.

The Joint Committee report stated the two

5
6

basic principles underlying the bill, and the first of

7

those was, "Since the rights of third parties who are

8

injured are established by state law, there is no

9

interference with the state law except for the $560

10

million limit of liability."
Senator Pastore, who was the chairman of the

11

12

Joint Committee when the *66 — or the floor manager,

13

I'm sorry — when the '66 amendments were made said,

14

"This bill follows the approach of the original

15

Price-Anderson Act; that is, making a minimum

16

interference with the laws of the several states insofar

17

as legal liability for nuclear incidents is concerned.

18

Our committee continues to endorse this general

19

approach."

20
21

Finally, the Joint Committee in 1966«

"The

bill has been drafted so that minor claims involving

22 nuclear facilities or materials” — and what we have
23 here is a minor claim — "may remain subject to the
24
25

traditional rules of tort law."
Now, there are no qualifications, and this
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

isn't a semantic thing.

Congress had a mind-set, and it

2

approached this problem with several concerns.

3

first of those concerns was that Congress or the

4

sponsors of Price-Anderson felt that if they tried tc

The

5 overly interfere with state tort, well, they couldn't
6

get a bill through Congress.

And so there are a number

7 of statements quoted in our brief of the principal

8 sponsors of this legislation saying we are going to
9

proceed by selective limitation on the state tort law.

10

We will identify with precision what it is about state

11

tort law that we think we need to modify, because that's

12

the only way we're going to get a bill through

13

Congress.

14

in a field that is so sensitively one of state's rights,

15

we're not going to get this bill through.

If we try to reach out in an overly bread way

So that was

16 number one.
17

Number two, they thought this to be an area

18

that was big and mysterious and had lots of elements,

19 and it was different in every state.

And they said

20

there's — the chairman of the Joint Committee said

21

there's a jungle of 50 states' tort laws out there.

22

don't know where to begin to tackle those, and we don't

23

want to.

24

problems are that we think we need to address and

25

address them explicitly.

We are simply going to identify what the

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

We

1

And finally and most importantly, Congress

2

said that except for extraordinary nuclear occurrences

3

— the meltdown of a power plant — there is no reason

4

why a nuclear plant should he treated any differently

5

than any other business entity in this country in terms

6

of its amenability to the tort law.

7

QUESTION:

Would a state tort action lie in

8

the nature of a nuisance suit against a power plant, a

9

nuclear power plant?

10

ME. GCTTESMAHi

I would think that it would

11

like for damages — if we're talking about radiation

12

emissions, then I would think that the message of this

13

— it isn't a necessary message, because that's not what

14

Congress was thinking about when they made these

15

statements;

16

being injured.

what they were thinking about were people

17

But if we're dealing with radiation emissions,

18

then however the state may put the label, if my property

19

or my person is injured by the emission of radiation and

20

I suffer an injury,

21

that I think the answer would be yes.

22

23
24
25

I have one of these lawsuits.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

2

Well, I think if — I think

3 the question of whether a state court could enjoin a
4

nuisance would be much more troubling, because there you

5

would be doing not that which Congress so clearly had in

7

which is conferring damages, but there you would

be, in effect, revoking the license of the plant tc

I think there's a very serious question

10

whether in light of PG£E that could be done.
QUESTIONi

11

What you're saying is that PG£E

12 dealt with safety regulation by the states as such,

by a

13 commission or perhaps by a nuisance action, but it
14

didn't go so far as tc say that perhaps things that are

15 tangentially concerned
16

with safety but primarily devoted

to compensation or punishment were also to be swept

17 under the rug with safety concerns.

MR. GOTTESMPNi

That is our submission, Your

Yes, that's right.
Now -- now, I do want to note we have in our

want to focus on that.

But the point that I do want to

2

focus on and close with is that Congress made a judgment

3 repeatedly articulated in this legislative history that
4 except

where we're dealing with an END, there is no

S

reason why these plants should be treated under the tort

6

law any differently than any other plant.

7

Kerr-McGee is here saying ah, but because we're a

8

nuclear operator, we ought to be exempted from the rules

9

that are applicable in tort suits against every other

10
11
12

And

plant.
Whatever the logic that they could spin out
for that, that is not the decision that Congress made,

13 and the legislative evidence is overwhelming that
14
15

Congress made the opposite decision.
QUESTION s

Well, Sr. — hr. — hr. Gottesman,

10 if the — if the plant is complying in all respects
17

safetywise with federal standards and federal

18 regulations but the state nevertheless and by virtue of
19

its tort standards says that you must conduct your plant

20 differently, you must run your plant differently or
21

you're going to be subject to a damage suit, and it

22 doesn't make any difference

to us whether you're

23 complying with the federal law or not; you have to
24

comply with this safety standard or you're going tc be

25 held to be negligent.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. LEE COOK, JR., ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF CF THE APPELLEES

3
4

MR. COOKj

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts

5

As has been noted, this case comes to the

6 Court as a $5,000 property damage case, the personal
7

injury aspects of the case having been disposed of by

8

the court of appeals below and not the subject of appeal

9

here.
The liability for that $5,000 in property

10
11

damages resulted from a — on the basis of a liability

12

without fault under the doctrine of strict liability.

13

The plaintiff conceded that he did not and could net

14

prove how the contamination to Karen Silkwocd's property

15

occurred.

16

Now, the question, the principal question

17

raised by this case is whether an award of punitive

18

damages with respect to a claim based on radiation

19 hazards resulting from the operation of a federally
20

licensed and regulated plutonium plant is preempted by

21

the Atomic Energy Act.
As has been noted, the question of

22
23

jurisdiction has been reserved.

24

25

Just a brief comment on

The plaintiff seeks to make jurisdiction in

this Court for mandatory appeal under Section 1254.2 of

2

the Judicial Code.

3

narrowly construed.

4

when the court of appeals invalidates a state statute as

That section is to be strictly and
It permits mandatory appeal only

5 being repugnant to the Constitution

8

or the laws of the

United States.
In this case, the state statute which

the

plaintiff seeks to invoke was not even mentioned by the

9 court of appeals, much less held invalid either facially
10 or as applied.
11

All the court did here was hold punitive

damages under the circumstances of this case cannot he

12 awarded; and

thus we urge that there is no jurisdiction

13 in this Court.
14

Also, we suggest to you that this is net an

15

appropriate case to take on certiorari.

16

facts make it very unlikely that it will have any

17 precedential value, and

Its unique

the basic principle upon which

18 it relies — namely, that stated in Pacific Gas and
19 Electric — does not involve any conflict in the
20 circuits but is now well settled in

21

light of your

decision last term.

22

Now, turning to the merits, in your decision

23

in Pacific Gas and Electric you described two forms of

24

preemption, both of which are applicable here.

First,

25 you said there is preemption if the Congress has fully
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

occupied a field.

You also said there is preemption

2

even if Congress does not fully occupy a field if the

3 state action stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment
4

of the federal purpose.

5

this case and require affirmance of the decision below.

6

Both those preemptions exist in

Let's talk about the first one f;Lrst.

In PG£E

7
8

9
10

QUESTION;

Which one did the court of appeals

use, both or just one?
MR. COOK;

Your Honor, I think they used the

11

— the preemption on the basis of entire occupation of

12

field, but I cannot tell you whether they also had in

13 mind that in this particular case there is an obstacle
14
15

to the accomplishment of a purpose.
In your decision in PG£F you removed any doubt

16

that Congress has fully occupied the field of the

17

regulation of nuclear hazards and the safety in the

18

operation of a radiation facility.

19

whether it's a nuclear reactor or whether it's a

20

plutonium plant.

21

And that applies

This is a licensed facility --

QUESTION;

Pr. Cook, if you’re right in that,

22

I suppose — and although the California case involved

23

state regulation licensing requirements -- if you’re

24

going to carry that over en bloc to state tort law,

25 which I don’t think that statement from PG£E at all
23

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

requires, I take it compensatory damages would also be

2

preempted.
MS. COOK;

3
4

Let me deal with that -- that point right now.
The fact of the matter is that the suggestion

5
6

No, Your Honor, T do not think so.

here, the argument here that there is -- that

7 compensatory damages are also preempted and that somehow
8

the Court was inconsistent in holding that punitive
damages were preempted and compensatcries were not I

10 believe is wrong for at least two reasons.

First of all. Congress in the Price-Anderson

11
12

Act and in the legislative history related to the

13 Price-Anderson Act indicated an intention that with
14

respect to the compensation of injured victims, making

15

them whole, it was the intention of Congress that they

16

should

17

intention with respect to punitive damage was ever

18

expressed .

1

have available state tort law remedies.

No such

Secondly, and probably more important, the

20 argument of the plaintiff here ignores the distinction
21

between punitive damages and compensatory damages.

22

Punitive damages have as their sole function controlling

23

of conduct, conduct that the jury believes does not meet

24

the safety standard that should be applied.

25

Compensatory damages, on the other hand, have
2U

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

as their primary function the recompensing of the

2

injured plaintiff; in other words, making the plaintiff

3

whole.

4

QUESTION;

Well, but surely you don’t suggest

5 that when the state court said charges on negligence
6

sufficient to support a recovery of compensatory damages

7 it isn’t laying down a standard of care directed
8

tc

saf ety ?
KB. COOK:

9

I don’t suggest that at all.

What

10

I do suggest is that there is a nonsafety rationale as

11

well, and that is the making whole of the innocent

12 injured

victim of a nuclear incident.
QUESTION;

13

Well, tut isn’t there also a

14 nonsafety rationale to punitive damages in the sense of
15

punishing someone who is regarded as having deliberately

16

done wrong?
MR. COOK;

17
18

so.

I believe,

No, Your Honor, I do not believe

particularly in Oklahoma, the law is

19 that punitive damages are to punish and deter conduct.
20

As a matter of fact, this Court reaffirmed that

21

principle just last term in Smith v. Wade where it said

22 the purposes of punitive damage is to punish
23

reprehensible conduct and deter the defendant and ethers

24

from engaging in that conduct in the future.

25

In fact, under Oklahoma law if punitive
25

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

damages do not have the effect of punishing and

2 deterring conduct, they will not he permitted to stand.
3

The case cited in our brief, the Nixon case, stands for

4

that proposition.

5

And in the most recent brief filed last week

6

by the plaintiff, its reply brief, there’s cited a new

7 Oklahoma punitive damage case.

It’s the most recent

8 statement by the Oklahoma Supreme Court on the subject
9 of punitive damages.

That case not only restates all

10 the principles that we expressed in our brief concerning
11

the role of punitive damages, but it has this additional

12 statement.

It said, "Unlike the purpose of compensatory

13 damages, which are to benefit the individual plaintiff,
14

punitive damages are imposed to benefit society.

The

15

plaintiff acts as a private attorney general to punish

16

the culpable wrongdoer, thereby encouraging adherence to

17 safety standards that benefit consumers generally."

So what the court in the Theory v. Armstrong

18

19 case at 661

Pacific Second and cited in the second

20 footnote to the plaintiff’s reply brief, has made it
21

clear is that punitive damages in Oklahoma are for the

22

purpose of imposing a safety standard and then enforcing

23

it.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, has the Oklahoma court said

that compensatory damages are not for that purpose?

KR. COOK

1

What the Oklahoma court I think has

2

said is that compensatory damages have — and the — as

3

their basis the intention to benefit the plaintiff, to

4

make him whole for the wrong he has suffered.
QUESTION!

5

What wrong, though.

Isn’t it as —

7

some standard of conduct has been violated before you’re

8

going to get —
HR. COOK:

9

Actually, in Oklahoma you do not

because there’s — it’s strict liability in Oklahoma.

11

So irrespective of the conduct you engage in, if it’s

10

HR. COOK:

QUESTION:

the defendant has not lived up to some state-imposed

finding that it was not operated reasonably and

—

standard that’s inconsistent with federal law.

5

don’t purport in this case, as far as I can

point — to rely for your preemption analysis on any

7

conflict of federal law.
MR. COOK;

8

9

Eut you

tell, to

It’s more general preemption.

We rely on that because that is the

basis of the decision below, that’s true.

10

QUESTION;

Yes.

11

MR. COOK;

There is a conflict, however, that

12

I want to deal with.
QUESTION;

13

Well, then, if there is, I don’t

14 know how you could concede on compensatory damages.

MR. COOK;

15

Well, Your Honor, the reason I'm

16 conceding on compensatory damages is because while
17

compensatory damages may have a regulatory effect and

18

they may produce a safety benefit, they have as well a

19 nonsafety rationale, and that is, making whole the
20

plaintiff who has been injured, who has suffered a less.
This Court said -- as a matter of fact, in

21
22

your opinion you said the ration — the question we must

23

ask —

24

QUESTION;

25

(Laughter. )

That was the Court’s opinion.

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

ME . COOK

1

That was the

excuse me, Your

2 Hon or.
The question we must ask in Pacific Gas and

3

4 Electric was is there a nonsafety rationale for the
5

state action, for the state statute involved there.
Now, if we apply that same question here, we

6

7 can see a difference between punitive damages and

8 compensatory damages, because if we ask that question
9 with respect to compensatory damages, we have to say

10 that there is a nonsafety rationale, and that rationale
11

is to make whole, to recompense the injured plaintiff

12

who has suffered damage because of a nuclear incident.

13

QUESTION.*

But under —

14

MR. COOK;

Whether it be because of a standard

15

of care or not.
QUESTION;

16
17

Under your analysis then it would

depend solely on the Oklahoma law.

If the Supreme Court

18 of Arkansas had said that our punitive damages are just
19

to make sure a plaintiff is really compensated -- it may

20 have nothing to do with safety — presumably the
21

punitive damages would go the same way as compensatory

22

damages under Arkansas law, even though it's a federal

23

inquiry.
MR. COCK;

24
25

point.

Your Honor.

It may very well turn on that
I think, however, generally speaking
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the law cf this country is that compensatory damages by

2

definition are not -- I mean punitive damages by

3 definition are not compensatory but indeed are for the
4

purpose cf punishing alleged wrongdoing and establishing

5 a safety standard.

After all, what we are dealing with here is

6
7

whether under Oklahoma law and the purposes of Oklahoma

8

— of punitive damages in Oklahoma we have preemption.

9

If we ask that same question — is there a nonsafety

10 rationale for the state action in the case of punitive
11

damages — we can only reach one answer.

There is no

12

rationale other than safety with respect to punitives.

13

And that is particularly so in Oklahoma.

14

QUESTION;

Well, punishment of the offender.

15

ME. COOK;

Punishment of the offender still

16

has as its purpose, I submit, safety.

It has no other

17 purpos e .
18

QUESTION;

Well, compensatory has the same

MR. COOK;

Compensatory has that element plus

19 ele men t.
20
21

the element of making the injured plaintiff whole, which

22 is not present with respect to punitive damages.
23

QUESTION;

Well, but punitive has the element

24

of punishing plus safety.

I mean you can say one --

25

each one of them has two components if you want to break

31

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

it down that way
ME. COOK;

2
3

Well, I submit, Your Honor, that

punishment has a safety rationale and a saf.ety rationale

4 only.

Why -- we only punish because this particular

5 defendant has not lived up tc the safety standard that
6 the jury has been convinced

is the appropriate safety

7 standard to apply.

QUESTION;

8
9 laws?

But, Mr. Cook, what about criminal

Say the criminal statute provided for punishment

10 for precisely the conduct that was involved here.
11

I

think you've conceded that would not be preempted.
MB. COCK;

12

Your Honor, I would concede that a

13 criminal statute is different.

I -- if — obviously if

14

someone takes — chooses plutonium as the means by which

15

to commit a crime as opposed to using a knife or some

16 other —
17

QUESTION;

Say the statute -- say they had a

18 statute — I can't recite these rather complicated facts

— the facts as we disclose by this record if done

20 maliciously and

so forth and so on shall constitute a

21

crime under the laws of Oklahoma punishable by a fine of

22

$10 million, would that be preempted?

Right.

HR. CCOKs

And we didn't have a chance to

15 respond to those.

Had they been in the opening brief,

16

we would have.

Suffice it to say, and the bottom line,

17

I think, on this is the testimony of the regional

18

director of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who had

responsibility for this plant.

He testified that it was

20 the view of his agency that the plant was safely

operated.
QUESTIONS

Yes, I know, but they had some kind

of a safety report that said there were about 18 or 20

24 safety problems, none of which violated the federal
25

reg ula tions.

KR . COOKs

Oh, well, Your Honor, if I could

just talk briefly about those.

3

were -- were, I submit, not the basis of the punitive

4

damage award in this case.

Those are matters which

Let me just give you an

5 illustration of one of them.

One of them said, for example, that there was

6

7 a period of — a contamination incident or contamination
8

was permitted to exist for

14 days.

It sounds like

9

there's some contamination out there that creates a

10 danger, a

risk. If you read the backup materials on

that what

you'll see is we had a vacuum cleaner that

11

we

12 had trouble cleaning, and so that they couldn't get it
13

clean,

14

aside and

15

that or whether they had to throw the vacuum cleaner

16

away.

17

so

they decided to put it in a bag and put it
decidewhether they could find a way to clean

It took

14 days to make that decision.

There was no exposure of the public or workers

18 or anybody to health.
19

The reason that was rejected by

the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is that it created no

20 health or safety problem.
21

The whole argument on that point — I'm kind

22 of getting out of order here -- but the whole argument
23

on that point, I submit, misses the point of what the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. GARVEY, ESQ.,

16

AS amicus curiae

17

MR. GARVEY;

Mr. Garvey.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

18 please the Court;
19

I would like to make just two points.

The

20

first of them is that the federal regulations in this

21

case do exactly what the state of Oklahoma was trying to

22

do through the imposition of punitive damages.

23

second point is that there is indeed a difference

24

between compensatory and punitive damages which

25

demonstrates that Congress intended to prohibit punitive

damages and intended to encourage compensatory damages.

2

Let me just say a few words about my first

3

point, which is that federal regulation is not only

4

adequate to cover this case but also does exactly what

5

Oklahoma did.
The Atomic Energy Act in Section 2077A and the

6

7 regulations promulgated by the NRC in Section 70.3 say
8

that you can’t possess plutonium without a license.

9 They also say that you can’t transfer plutonium except
10

to a licensee.

There is no limit on the amount of

11

plutonium that they’re speaking about.

That means that

12 with respect to the 300 micrograms that were found in
13

Silkwood’s apartment in this case that if either party

14 had been responsible for the transfer or the possession
15

of that plutonium in the apartment, it would have — it

16

would have violated both the statute and the regulations.

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. GARVEY;

19 so.

Is this a radioisotope, Mr. Garvey?
I wish I knew.

I don't think

I think when Congress used the words radioisotope

20

in 1959 they meant maybe things like cobalt 60 and --

21

and —

22

QUESTION;

Certainly it's fairly important to

23

determine in deciding whether this has been preempted or

24

not, under the government’s theory, isn’t it, when the

25

Joint Committee Report in '59 says we’re leading —

Ch, there is — there is

QUESTION;

to

In the *59 report the

Well, one thing Congress said was

that we're leaving radioisotopes to the states.
MR. GARVEY;

Yes.

There is no question but

10

that this is not radioisotope within the meaning of that

11

discussion.

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. GARVEY;

And what's your authority for that?
Well, I think if you look at the

14

AEC analysis of the bill, which appears in 105

15

Congressional Record

10

and Senate reports that accompany the 1959 amendments,

17

it’s clear that Congress made a distinction between

18

facilities that possess special nuclear material in

19

quantities sufficient to form a critical mass, and this

20

was such a facility, on the one hand.

21

that are used for medical purposes or related uses, on

22

the other hand.

23

*83-’84, and if you read the Reuse

And radioisotopes

There is no doubt but that Congress intended

24

to cover this facility.

There is no doubt but that the

25

-- that the amount of plutonium found in her apartment,

had Kerr-NcGee been responsible for. its presence there,

2 would have violated both the statute and the regulations.
I might go on to say that the regulations also

3

4 provide in great detail for the — for the protection of
5 workers in plutonium and processing facilities like this
8

one.

They talk about what sort of precautionary

7 procedures have to be taken in handling plutonium.
8

They

also set exposure limitations which — which — which

9 apply to this case.

The baseline exposure limitation is that

10
11

operators of these kinds of facilities have to keep

12 exposures as lew as reasonably achievable.

Now, any

13 willful exposure to plutonium almost by definition
14 violates the as low as reasonably achievable standard,
15

but it might also say that the amount of plutonium that

16

the NEC discovered on its investigation in this case —

17 that was discovered at the autopsy,
18

had it been received

in the course of a week or even in the course of a

19 quarter would also have violated the numerical
20 limitations that are found at the end of Part 20 of
21
22

10

CFR .
In addition to that statutory and regulatory

23

scheme, the NEC imposes on licensees specifically

24

tailored license conditions to make sure that these

25

plants are operated safely.

In this case the license
42

was about that thick.
QUESTION*

2

It was introduced as Exhibits —
So your — your point is -- is —

3

is that if -- that if had been shown that Kerr-KcGee was

4

responsible for the presence of that plutonium,

5

would have been a violation of federal law.
MR. GARVEY;

6
7

Yes.

there

I want to go farther than

that, because the NRC conducted an investigation, and

8 its report is reproduced as an appendix to the mcticn to
9

dismiss in this case.

The NRC concluded that the

10

appellees had not violated the federal regulations.

11

they had concluded that there had been a violation, the

12

current procedures, which you will find in Appendix C to

13

Part 2 of 10 CFR, say, for example,

14

impose civil fines for any significant failure to

15

control licensed material.
QUESTION*

16

Well,

that the NRC can

That would include this case.
that wouldn't — there

17

wouldn't be any intention to — there wouldn't be any

18

bar, though, to a -- to a state court action for

HR. GARVEY;

21

QUESTION;

If

No, it would not.
— For the violation of the federal

22 law .
23

MR. GARVEY;

No, it would not.

In fact,

24

Congress intended to encourage awards of punitive — of

25

compensatory damages.

The NRC has no authority to award
a3

440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

2

compensatory damages.
QUESTIONj

Eight, right.

So there was nc

3 intent to preempt the state damage action.
4

SR. GARVEY:

Indeed not.

In fact, the

5 Price-Anderson Act rests on the assumption that state
6

compensatory damages actions are permissible.

7 other hand,

Cn the

Congress enacted Section 2282 for the

8 specific purpose of allowing the NEC itself to impose

civil fines.

And as this Court noted in Gertz against

10 Robert Welch, punitive damages are nothing other than
11
12

private fines levied by civil juries.
There are a number of differences between

13

compensatory and punitive damages which make clear

14

Congress' intent.

That first is that the statute treats

15

them differently.

It leaves to the states the award of

16 compensatory damages.

It gives to the NRC the authcrity

17 to impose civil fines.
18
1
20
21

The second point I’d like to make is that
appellant suggests that in some way reading the —
QUESTION;

But, Nr. Garvey, the civil fines

imposed by the NRC, do they go to a person who's

22 claiming injury or do they go to the government?
23

HR. GARVEY;

24

QUESTION;

25

Well, they go to the government.
So that isn't exactly analogous

then to punitive damages.
44

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

2

MR. GARVEY:

No, it's not exactly analogous,

although Oklahoma law recognizes that — that the

3 collection of punitive damages isn't a right of the
4 private party.

It's really a private party acting as a

5

private attorney general on behalf of the public.

6

think where they go is really a matter of insignificance.

7
8

9

Sc I

Appellant suggests that in some way it's
strange that Congress might —
QUESTION;

Excuse me there.

The impact on the

10

wrongdoer, if he is a wrongdoer, is the same whether the

11

money goes to the government or whether it goes to the

12

private claimant.

13

MR. GARVEY:

That's correct.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GARVEY:

16

Appellant suggests that in some way it's

It has a deterrent effect.
That’s correct.

That's correct.

17 strange that Congress should have drawn this line
18

between compensatory and punitive damages, but it’s done

19 in any number of other statutes as this Court has
20

recognized.

If this had been -- if this facility had

21

been a federal facility, the Federal Tort Claims Act

22 would have subjected the government to state standards
23

for negligence in suits for compensation but would net

24 have permitted suits for punitive damaaes.
25

This Court

has recognized that the Railway Labor Act, suits brought
45

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

under that act permit compensation hut not punitive

2 damages.
3

Section 303 of the Labor-Management Relations

Act permits compensation but not punitive damages

4 precisely because of the effect that they have on future

5 conduc t.
That's, I might add, a sensible reason for

6

7 drawing a line between compensatory and punitive damages
8

in this case.

In Pacific Gas and Electric this Court

9

said that states were free to reject nuclear power if it

10 cost too much, but not because it was unsafe.

I might add the Court’s opinion said that

11

12 states were free to reject nuclear power if it cost too
13 much,
14

even though the decision about cost entailed seme

thinking about safety.

15

In the same way. Congress intended that the

16

states should be allowed to assure that nuclear power

17 pay all its costs — the cost of injury, the cost of
18

harm — but that they not be allowed to go further and

19

punish nuclear licensees for operating unsafely.

20

QUESTION;

Well, I suppose that in the process

21

of awarding compensatory damages if in a particular case

22

the state was attempting to impose a standard of

23

performance inconsistent with federal law, that would

24 pose a different problem.
25

ME. GARVEY;

I don't believe so.

I think that

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Congress intended

2

award compensation under standards of strict liability.

3

Indeed, in the Price-Anderson Act they wanted to

4

encourage that in the case of extraordinary nuclear

5

occurrence.
QUESTION;

6
7

Well, you aren't answering my

question.
MR. GARVEY;

8

9

that the states should be allowed to

Well, I think I — I think I am,

because in awarding damages under standards of strict

10 liability, the state makes no decision about standards
11
12

of care.
QUESTION;

Well, I asked you if the state was

13

awarding damages in accordance with some standard of

14

care that was inconsistent with the federal law.

15

didn't work — suppose the state isn't — doesn’t

16

purport to award damages on a strict liability basis.

17

They are awarding damages because you failed to run your

18

plant this particular way, and it just happens to be

19

inconsistent with the federal law.

20
21

MR. GARVEY;

They

I find it curious that appellants

have turned that argument tc their own advantage.

22 they're really saying is if

And that, I believe -- I

MR. GOTTESMAN:

QUESTION:

9

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Why?

I'm sorry.
Ycu said it would extend —
Why would it extend?

Eecause

10

I don't know how one could attribute tc Congress, at

11

least from the legislative history we've got, a dividing

12

line that says the state can take the same malicious

13 conduct or reckless conduct and if it calls it a crime,
14

then it is free to punish it, but if it calls it

15 punitive damages, then it is not free to do it.
16

I'm not saying Congress couldn't make that

17 distinction.

What I'm saying is there is absolutely

18 nothing in this statute or in the logic of the
19 legislative history that could allow one to conclude
20
21
22

that that was the line that Congress actually drew here .
But the point I want to make is that it isn't
true that two punishments are the same.

The federal

23 government is punishing violations of its regulations.
24 The deterrent purpose is that so people won't violate
25

the regulations again.

The state, through punitive damages, is

Its

Now, that isn't limited.

In this case it

The state's conce-rn is that it has found a
