8R. WITLEN*

The union paid for the entire

15

cost of the election including the arbitrator with the

16

understanding, which was discussed at the time, that the

17

union could seek reimbursement from the Plaintiffs if

18

th.e District Court's injunction was ultimately

overtu rned.

20

QUESTION ;

Would there have been that sort of

21

expense to either party if the Secretary had brought the

22

injunction?

23

MR. WITLER*

Certainly some of the expenses of

24

conducting an election would have been incurred, but the

25

major expense, that in excess cf $7,000 to pay the

5
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

arbitrator's expenses would not have been incurred

2

because the Secretary of Labor does not charge the union

3

for its expenses and personnel in conducting the

4

election.

5

That is the greatest bulk of the expense.
QUESTIONi

Were the procedures for the

6

election under the court order like the procedures that

7

the Secretary would follow under IV?

8

9
10
11
12

13

MR. WITLENi

There were major discrepancies

between what the Secretary would do and what the union
would do and what the court ordered.
QUESTION;

Can you say briefly what the

difference would be?
MR. WITLENi

Primarily the arbitrators that

14

were appointed did not have the expertise of the

15

Secretary to make evaluations as to the application cf

16

the Secretary's own administrative regulations or the

17

union's constitutional regulations and requirements.

18

QUESTION:

The question I wanted to ask in my

19

mind is the violations here concern the nomination

20

meeting as I remember.

21

MR. WITLENs

22

QUESTIONi

That is correct.
Would

you make basically the same

23

argument tiiat you make today if the action had been

24

brought promptly after the nomination meeting after the

25

alleged violations occurred?

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

MR. WITLEHi

We would not be making the same

2

argument if the suit was brought prior to the time the

3

ballots were mailed out.

4

QUESTION;

Would not some of your policy

5

arguments be equally strong about having the wrong

6

people running the election and so forth?

7

MR. WITLENi

If we were to address that

8

question prior to Calhoon and ignoring the prior cases

9

of this Court we would say that the public policy issues

10

and the legislative history arguments clearly discern a

11

congressional intent that there be no pre-election Title

12

I relief.

13

recognition of the language in Calhoon and in Bachowski

14

that seems to recognize some appropriate role for a

15

court under Title I.

16

The arguments that we made were in

Therefore, the line we are asking is a line

17

that we would be happy to see the Court extend, i.e., to

18

say there is no Title I relief, but we think that the

19

line can be drawn in our favor in this case without

20

going that far.

21

22
23
24
25

QUESTIONt

But the whole question really is at

what point in time has an election been conducted.
MR. WITLEN:

No, it is not the whole point

because that —

2

MB. WITLEN;

It is only marginally different

3

from Judge Campbell.

4

get to the point where the only remedy in order to grant

5

the relief requested is to conduct a new election the

6

Court does not have Title I jurisdiction.

7

Cur basic theory is that once you

Well,

that could have ha'ppened if

8

they had brought the suit right after the nomination

9

meeting.

10

The only effective remedy might be a court

supervised election.

11

MB. WITLEN;

I think at that point the court

12

could have merely nullified the nomination meeting and

13

gene back to the union and say do it again.

14

been no ballots printed or distributed at that time.

15

agree,

16

arguments and the logic of

17

is set forth in our brief is that even at that point the

18

court should not have had Title I jurisdiction to

19

challenge even the nomination meeting considering the

20

nomination meeting to be part cf the election.
QUESTION;
think

25

the legislative history that

Surely if ballots had been cast you

the election has in effect been had?

concerning the conduct of union election of officers.

First, is that Title IY was intended to

bears repeating that all of the bills considered in the

2

House and the Senate provided that rerun elections were

3

to be conducted by the Secretary of Labor regardless of

4

how you happen to get to the point of having an order to

5

rerun the election.

6

I submit that this case provides a textbook

7

example of how the safeguards and objectives carefully

8

established in Title IV will inevitably be nullified

9

when a court acting under Title I is permitted to

10

substitute its judgment as to how an election should be

11

conducted for that of the Secretary, the Congress or the

12

union involved.

13

elections are to be conducted no less frequently than

14

once every three years and that the winners are to be

15

installed regardless of whether there is a challenge to

16

the outcome of that election.

17

For example, the statute specifies that

Well, here we did not have an election for

18

four years, and in the interim we had lame duck officers

19

responsible for running the union.
QUESTION :

20

23

Was an election conducted this

January?
MR . WITLENs

There was an election conducted

in December of 1983.

December.

MR. WITLEH;

Yes.

QUESTION:

So why is it not moot?
I
HR. WITLENi
There are a number of arguments

2
3

made on behalf of why it is not moot.

4

order to resolve the matters presently pending before

5

the District Court we must have the determination from

6

this Court as to whether the District Court had

7

jurisdiction to issue the type of relief it ordered.

8

Second, the Court itself has held in Glass

11

Secretary or the courts of the authority to back

13

whether any of the alleged violations which occurred in

14

that election could have tainted the second election.

15

to

We think that is certainly the case here.

One

16

of the issues that was never resolved by the District

17

Court in this case was the legality of the continuous

18

good standing requirement as a condition of eligibility

19

to run for office.

21

Finally,

That is a question that has not been

we believe that this case would fall

22

within the Court's general parameters of a case capable

23

of repetition yet evading review because of the short

24

time limitation and the time it takes to get a case up

25

to this Court.

11
ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Another statutory goal that cannot be

2

accomplished under Title I is that of specifying that

3

the statute only specifies minimal government

4

intervention in union affairs and

5

unions to establish rules in its bylaws as to how the

6

election will be conducted.

7

leaves it to the

The union has been found to be free to conduct

8

its elections in accordance with its own procedures so

9

long as the procedures comply with the statute.

Here in

10

contrast the District Court issued an injunction which

11

provided for detailed rules, took the entire

12

administration of the election procedures out of the

13

hands of the union and placed them into the hands cf

14

arbitrators that it happened to find willing to conduct

15

this type of an election.
Kost importantly, congressional history

16
17

indicates an intent to reserve challenges to the conduct

18

of the election until after the election has been

19

completed and to prevent any faction in the union from

20

delaying the election, and even once that election was

21

completed if a member sought to challenge its outcome,

court intervention was to be delayed until after the

There was no compliance with the time

17

that the Secretary of Labor has to investigate a

19

procedures entirely ignored the Secretary of Labor,

20

precluding him from investigating the complaint,

21

precluding him from being able to attempt to settle a

precluding him from serving as a screening agent to

Any relief that pertains to the

Is the Secretary’s action under

exhaustion rather than judicial power?

2

SR. WITLEN:

Certainly.

We are not sayinq

3

that the courts have no role in the conduct of

intentionally and repeatedly delayed until after these

Let me begin by saying a word about the

20

question that Justice Brennan asked, how if the

21

Secretary had conducted this election might it have been

22

run differently.

23

then a few specific examples.

24
25

Let me give a few general examples and

Section 402 of Title IV says that when
elections are to be rerun they are to be rerun in

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

accordance with regulations that the Secretary is to

2

promulgate.

3

29 CFR .

4

Those regulations appear in part in 452 of

I think it gees without saying that in running

5

the election the Secretary would be more familiar with

6

the operation of those regulations than would a court.

7

The second difference is that this is the first time

8

that the district judge had rerun a teamster election,

9

and he was no doubt not as familiar with the teamster's

10

constitution and bylaws as the Secretary would be

11

because this would not be the first time the Secretary

12

had rerun a teamster's election.

13

Some more particular examples might be one of

14

the things that we do not find in the District Court's

15

injunction that the Secretary does do in the course of

16

elections is to read all of the publications that are

17

sent out in the course of the election, not just

18

campaign materials, but the Secretary rereads the proofs

19

of the newspaper that the union circulates, for example,

20

to make sure that it does not support one side rather

21

than the other.

22

You do not see any provision for that.

So in that sense the Secretary would often do

23

more than the District Court, and in some cases the

24

Secretary would do less than the District Court did.

25

For example, the injunction here provides that the

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

arbitrators were actually tc run the nominations meeting

2

so that means somebody would be up at the podium running

3

the meeting.

4

Mhen the Secretary has a nominations meeting

5

rerun they have a pre-election conference at which the

6

rules for conducting the meeting will be set out, and

7

there will be an observer there to take notes to make

8

sure that things to all right.

9

be run by the Secretary.

But it wil.1 not actually

So sometimes they do more.

10

Sometimes they do

11

less.

12

example, in the joint appendix I notice in the District

13

14

course of this election was a question about whether

For

Under the District Court's

If the Secretary had been rerunning the

20

election and there were nothing faulty about the union's

21

own procedures toward determining eligibility

22

requirements the appeals on eligibility questions would

23

have followed those normal procedures to the union's

24

general president and then the general executive board

25

and then to the Secretary.

Mr. Garvey, in this case was there

objection to the order before it was entered by
counsel?
MR. GARVEY:

By the Secretary or by the

par tie s?
QUESTION:

By anybody.

MR. GARVEY:

There was considerable

negotiation in the District Court once it had been
decided that the court was going to enjoin the
electi on.
QUESTION:

Was it ever pointed out to the

court it would be inproper for the court to run the
electi on ?
MR. GARVEY:

Yes, indeed.

I believe that was

the basis for the union's objection.
QUESTION:

This was before the court entered

the judgment or afterwards?
MR. GARVEY:

That was before the District

Court entered the injunction.

The Secretary did not

intervene in this action until the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Mr. Garvey, I assume you have no

trouble with moctness either?
MR. GARVEY:

No, we do not, Your Honor, both

Where does the Secretary draw the

Unless he gives Title I no room at

MR. GARVEY:

No, that is not so.

The

19

Secretary does give plenty cf room for Title I.

The

20

line that we would draw is that -- Let me back up just

21

one step and tell you where we get.

22

In the statute we think Congress could have

23

been a little bit more explicit than it was about how

24

Titles I and IV ought to fit together, but we think it

25

gave at least three signals.

The first of those is that

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

Section 402 sets out a very detailed system, which Mr.

2

Witlen outlined, for rerunning elections.

3

The second signal is that Section 102 as you

4

suggested cautions the district courts in Title I cases

5

that they are to provide only such relief as is

6

appropriate.

7

Section 403 which says that the Title IV procedure for

8

challenging an election which has been already conducted

9

shall be exclusive.

10

The third signal that Congress gave is in

Now, that language does not solve this case
completely or we would not be here, but its purpose, I

2

think,

3

reason Congress put it in the statute was that Congress

4

did not want the courts rerunning elections.

5

with all of that the line that we would propose for

6

accommodating these is that Title I relief should never

7

be considered appropriate under Section 102 if Title IV

8

relief is adequate to resolve the election violations

9

that are being complained of.

provides considerable assistance because the

In line

20

let me give an example or two about what kinds

21

of Title I relief would be appropriate in the context of

22

union officer elections.

23

this Court decided two years ago.

24

complaints about equal rights and free speech in the

25

context of a union officer election.

One is the Finnegan case that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

that there a union’s business representative had been

2

discharged after supporting the incumbents who lost the

3

electi on.
In that sort of case there is not relief

4
5

available under Title IV because what he wanted was

6

reinstatement, and running a new election would not give

7

him that necessarily.

8

the Sadlowski case decided the same term as Finnegan

9

there was again a complaint about free speech rights in

In

connection with a union officer election.
There the complaint was that the union had

12

improperly amended its constitution to forbid nonmember

afforded in this case.

11

On the other hand , neither the Court of

please the Court:

15

The issues raised on this appeal are less

numerous and of less general application than the

issue here is primarily one of whether a party may seek

occurred in this case.

Now,

I ask the Court to consider the fact that

rerunning that election.

It is the Secretary of Labor

How often do district courts get

into that posture?

MR. STERN;

Every time there is a recalcitrant

In 'conciliation

The Secretary has no power to order a new
10

election.

11

12

A court must order it.
QUESTION;

Once ordered, why can’t the

district judge let the Secretary take over?

13

MR. STERN;

He can, but I believe the practice

14

is that the Secretary submits a proposed order to the

15

court and the court acts on the proposed order, and

16

therefore it is the court’s order that is in fact what

17

determines the terms.
What opposing parties argue here is not the

court lacked jurisdiction because the Secretary concedes

that as do the union and the government and the

What if the elections had been

then would there be a Title I remedy based on the

allegedly illegal nominations?

13

SR. STERN:

No.

We think the point in time of

counting the ballots and letting the people know where

15

they came out is in fact the time that Title IV talks

Mr. Stern, don’t all these

arguments go to whether this particular judge handled

9

this particular matter in a proper way rather than the

power of the court to handle it at all?

11

MR. STERN;

I do not think there is any

12

question that the court has the power to handle Title I

13

violations, and I do not think there is any question in

14

this case —

15

QUESTION;

As I understand your opponents even

16

though

17

there is virtually no power in a district court until

18

after the election has been conducted in trying to

19

figure out when the election has been conducted.

20

is an awful lot of argument between the parties about

21

whether the judge did everything right or whether he was

22

too slow or the union was recalcitrant in this case.

23

they may not phrase it in terms of power they say

There

It seems to me that is all entirely immaterial

24

in this case.

We are dealing with a rather narrow

25

question of law.

MR. STERN;

Yes.

I believe union 's

2

recalcitrance is germane to the court's consideration on

3

one point, and that is what the alternative remedy tc

4

these members would be when you have a person who is

5

recalcitrant and willing to delay the processes that

exist under Title IV and only relevant to that point.

Mr. Stern, may we come back a

NR. STERN:

Yes, it could if it deemed it

10

appropriate.

It might deem lesser remedies

11

appropriate.

Unfortunately the Secretary only has one

12

choice and that is all or nothing.

13

I would like to suggest that the stepping in

14

the day before and giving a temporary restraining order

15

and holding off for several months before entering its

16

promoted the purpose of this Act that the opposino

The processes engaged in by the District Court

If you

10

look at 402(a)(2)(b) -- excuse me, 402(b) of the statute

— try once more, 402(a)(2) of the statute provides that

The second statutory misconstruction is Mr.

Now if as Hr. Stern says there were in fact

15

then this Court cannot accept his further conclusion

16

that unions will also take the two and a half years to

17

litiga te to death any suit of the Secretary of Labor

18

because here in fact once those violations became

19

obvious and once the litigation problems became obvious

20

the union here offered to conduct a new election and to

21

grant the plaintiffs exactly the type of remedy they

22

were looking for so long as the District Court modified

23

its temporary restraining order to allow the union to

24

conduct it under its own rules.

25

The District Court refused to do that.
