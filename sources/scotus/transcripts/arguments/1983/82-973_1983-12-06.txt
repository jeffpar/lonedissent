ON BEHAIF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GELLER:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether Congress,

11
12

when it passed the Refugee Act of 1980, intended tc

13

change the substantive standard that an alien must meet

14

under Section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality

15

Act in order to avoid deportation on the ground that he

16

would he subject to persecution.
Although the Second Circuit stated that the

17
18

matter was not free from doubt, that court held that

19

Congress in 1980 had intended to make a significant

20

change in the substantive standard under Section

21

243(h).

for withholding relief under Section 243(h).

Now, Respondent sought review of the EIA’s

substantially liberalize the standard that an alien must

satisfy under Section 243(h).

declined to announce what in its view was the proper

standard, but it did state that deportation must new be

Well, the terms "clear

interchangeably by the Board of Immigration Appeals and

Not to my knowledge, Justice

Blackm un.
Now, that was the situation prior to 1968, and

as I say, there is no assertion that the pre-1968

was in any way incorrect.

One was the

1968 to the United Nations

passage in 1980 of the Refugee Act.
It is the government's position that neither

11
12

of the statutory changes was intended in any way to

13

alter the substantive standard applied to Section 243(h)

14

relief, so that if the standard was correct, as we take

15

everyone to agree it was prior to 1968, it is still the

16

correct standard today because each time Congress has

17

revisited this area of the law, although it has changed

18

some of the terminology, it has gone on record as saying

19

it didn’t intend to make any substantive change in the

20

standard that the Board and the court should apply in

judging claims for withholding relief.

This is what the

May I ask you a question about the

protocol ?

12

ME. GELLED:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.
Mr. Geller, the convention from

14

1951 requires that the alien have a well-founded fear,

15

that is, be a refugee, and also that the alien's life or

16

freedom would be threatened.

17

Do those two phrases mean the same thing?

18

ME. GELLER:

I think that the well-found --

19

the life or freedom would be threatened is simply a

20

synonym for what we had called up until that point

21

persecution, and the well-founded fear goes to the

22

substantive standard that an alien must meet in order to

23

show that he would be persecuted.

24

Congress intended either change when it adhered to the

protocol, even though the protocol had

And in fact, as we quote

All of the representations made to the Senate

10

in

1958 indicated that our immigration laws already

11

included the human provisions of the protocol, and

12

perhaps the best evidence of this, the fact that

13

Congress thought it was simply making a symbolic gesture

14

when it adhered to the protocol, was that there was

15

absolutely no opposition to the protocol.

16

virtually no hearings cn the protocol, and it passed the

17

Senate unanimously.

There were

We think it was therefore common ground in

18
19

1968 that the phrase "well-founded fear of persecution,"

20

which appears in the protocol, was not — was meant —

21

was thought to mean the same thing as the test that the

exactly the same was borne out by the administrative

practice over the next 12 years because no court, after

accession to the protocol in 1968, held that the

QUESTION*

So what this case is all about, in

7

your view, is how one defines the term "well-founded

8

fear of persecution."

9

ME. GELLERi

Well, no.

We think what this

10

case is all about is whether Congress, in adhering to

11

the protocol in 1968, or in passing the Refugee Act of

12

1980, intended in any way by using the phrase

13

"well-founded fear" as a substitute for prior phrases to

14

change the substantive standard that the Board and the

15

court should follow in applying --

16

QUESTION*

But that in turn must be decided,

17

suppose, upon what Congress meant by using the term

18

"well-founded fear of prosecution."

MR. GELLERs

I

Well, I think in part that is

20

correct, and as I am saying, by adhering to the protocol

which included

22

adhering to it on the understanding that it would net

following up until 1968, we think Congress was obviously

It failed to give any — what it

said was that the way that the Board and the courts had

Yes.

Yes, because if you can show a

well-founded fear,

then you would be entitled to asylum

7

relief, for example, under Section 208 of the act, and

8

since withholding of deportation relief is a lesser

9

remedy than granting asylum, it seems logical that

10

Congress couldn’t have meant to deport someone who would

11

be in -- who would have — meet the eligibility standard

12

under Section 208 for asylum.

13

as to that.

the Immigration Service therefore has the power to

2

follow only those provisions of the protocol which have

3

been enacted into law in the Refugee Act of 1980.

4

Now, I am not discussino that whole thing.

5

The government takes whichever side it feels that it

6

should take and then tries to say that, well, if we call

7

this well-founded fear and it is really clear

8

probability, then they are all really the same.
Now, I would like to, before I go any further,

9

10

make some statements about the facts of this case

11

because I think that the difference between clear

12

probability and well-founded fear can be highlighted by

13

the facts, by the very facts in the Stevie case and the

14

government has left out some of the facts which I think

15

would throw some light on what the difference is.
Mr. Stevie, as was stated, came to the dUnited

16
17

States in 1976.

He applied for I think an extension.

18

In any case, he came before an immigration judge who

19

gave him the ability to leave the country voluntarily.

20

He was not ordered deported.
Shortly thereafter he married an

21

American

22

citizen.

Now, the background of this lady has a bearing

23

on this case.

At the time that Mr. Stevie married Mirjana
