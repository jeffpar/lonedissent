CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SCHNAPPER;

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
The question before the Court in this case is

2

not whether all class actions bar as a matter of res

3

judicata if unsuccessful all subsequent individual

4

actions.

5

regard to Rule 23 and with regard to res judicata

6

against any such across the board sweeping approach.

7

series of decisions in this Court, most recently General

8

Telephone versus Falcon, insist that careful attention

9

be paid to the record in a class action in administering

20
2

This Court has repeatedly admonished both with

A

Rule 23.
Similarly,'a number of decisions, most

22

recently this Court's decision in Brown against Felsen,

23

insist that there be similar care paid in the

24

administration of the res judicata principles.

25

This case involves a conjunction of both of

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

those lines of cases, and we contend that the Court of

2

Appeals paid insufficient attention to the actual

3

decision in the class action in holding that the second

4

action was tarred by the principles of res judicata.

5

Although the primary question at issue before

6

the Court in this case is the scope and meaning of the

7

decision in the class action about which we are in

8

disagreement with the bank, the overall procedural

9

outlines of the case are relatively straightforward and

10

c 1 e ar.
The initial action, which we all refer to now

11
12

as the Cooper action, was an action against the bank

13

brought both by Sylvia Cooper and three other individual

14

employees, and by the EEOC.

15

September of 1980.

16

judge handed down three distinct decisions.

The case was tried in

Following the trial, the district

First, he held with regard to the claims of

17
18

promotion discrimination which were the subject of the

19

lawsuit that there had been a pattern anl practice of

20

discrimination in Grades 4 and 5 at the bank.

21

the judge held that there had not been, or actually his

22

phrase was there had been "insufficient proof" of, a

23

pattern and practice of discrimination in Grades 6 and

24

above.

25

QUESTION;

Second,

Hr. Schnapper, you use the phrase,

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) «28-0300

1

"a pattern ani practice of discrimination."

2

think when you put "a pattern and practice of" to modify

3

the term "discrimination" it changes the substantive

4

inquiry at all?

5

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Do you

It does not change the

6

substantive inquiry, but there are, in any Title 7 case,

7

there are a number of kinds of acts which might be at

8

issue.

9

out earlier, whether or not there is a pattern and

Whether or not, as Mr. Justice Powell pointed

individual acts of discrimination are related but

12

distinct questions.

practice and yet an employee might have been dismissed

14

solely for reasons --

15

QUESTION;

There could be a pattern and

But is the ultimate inquiry in a

16

pattern and practice suit whether or not there was

17

intentional discrimination?

18

22

MR. SCHN APPEP:

Well, first of all, of course,

there are two kinds of Title 7 cases, intentional and —
QUESTION;

Let's assume this is not a Griggs

type case, where you are talking about tests.
MR. SCHNAPPERs

Right.

There would be two

23

questions that would come up, and because they were

24

litigated at different phases, it becomes important to

25

distinguish them.

The first question, at least in a

5

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

bifurcated proceeding, the first question a court

2

typically addresses is whether or not there was a

3

classwide, systematic policy of discrimination.

4

If if holds that it was, th^n it goes on to

5

determine as to each specific employee whether or not he

6

or she was a victim of that practice.

7

QUESTION:

But that is an inquiry as to

8

whether it was intentional discrimination, not just

9

disparate impact, isn’t it?

10

HR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, in the hypothetical case

11

that you describe of an intent case, yes, both questions

12

concern intentional discrimination, but they are not the

13

same question.

14

last month’s decision in United States versus an

15

assortment of 89 firearms.

16

forfeiture case was, of course, related to the issue in

17

the previous criminal prosecution in the United States

18

of Olvac, Mervers, and Mulcahy, but they weren't the

19

same question.

20

They are related, as,

QUESTIONt

for example, in

The issue in the civil

There were some places in your

21

brief I got the impression that you were suggesting that

22

at the inquiry, the substantive inquiry in a pattern and

23

practice case was disparate impact rather than

24

intentional discrimination, but I must have

25

misunderstood you.

1

MR. SCHNAPPERi

It is more likely I misphrased

2

the passage involved, but certainly that is not our

3

position.

4

the question with regard to the existence of a pattern

5

and practice would be the existence of a classwide

6

practice of intentional discrimination.

7

If ve are dealing with an intent case, then

In any event, the court, the District Court in

8

the Cooper action, the class action, found that there

9

was a pattern and practice of discrimination in Grades 4

10

and 5, that there was not -- that any discrimination in

11

Grades 6 and above was not pervasive enough to warrant a

12

classwide remedy, and then with regard to the four named

13

individuals, all of whom were in Grade 6 and above, the

14

court sustained the claims of two of them and rejected

15

the claims of two others.

16

The Baxter litigation, the individual suit,

17

were precipitated by a decision in Cooper to deny

18

intervention to Baxter and the other Baxter plaintiffs,

19

an event which is, I think, anticipated by Note 4 in

20

this Court’s decision last June in Crown Cork and Seal.

21

In ruling from the bench on May 8th, 1981, that he

22

wouldn’t permit intervention, Judge McMillan squarely

23

suggested that the Baxter plaintiffs ought to file their

24

own lawsuit.

25

That is precisely what they did.

What we and the

decided in the earlier class action.
In order to assess the meaning of Judge

12

McMillan's opinion, it is important to put it in the

13

context both of the nature of the issue that was before

14

the court and the procedure that was followed.

15

are, of course, certain kinds of class actions in which

16

a resolution of the merits of the pattern and the sort

17

of classwide liability claim would be absolutely

18

dispositive of the individual claims.

19

There

A common example, happily uncommon example of

20

However, Title 7 cases, as I think Mr. Justice

9
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Powell's earlier question indicated, are different.

2

is quite possible that there could be a pattern and

3

practice of discrimination and yet an individual who was

4

dismissed or not hired or denied a promotion might still

5

have had that take place for non-discriminatory reasons,

6

and the decision in Mt. Healthy expressly focuses on

7

that possibility.

8

9

It

Similarly, it is. possible that in the absence
of a pattern and practice of discrimination, there

10

might, in the words of the Teamsters decision, be

11

"isolated or accidental or sporadic" discriminatory

12

acts.

13

Company versus Waters emphasized that a balanced work

14

force, a racially balanced work force doesn’t immunize

15

an employer from liability for specific acts of

16

discrimination, and the Court's decision in General

17

Telephone versus Falcon also noted that there is a wide

18

gap between the kinds of evidence that would prove an

19

individual case and the kinds of evidence that would

20

prove a classwide pattern and practice.

21

This Court in its decision in Furnco Construction

Thus, although in some cases, such as an

22

airplane crash, it would be inconsistent for a judge to

23

hold there was liability to some individuals but not to

24

the class, in the case of Title 7, such judgment would

25

be perfectly consistent, and indeed, that is precisely

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

what happened here with regards to Grade 6 and above.

2

Judge KcMillan held that there was no pattern and

3

practice of discrimination in Grade 6 and above, and yet

4

he held that there were two individuals, Cooper and

6

Russell, who were the victims of discrimination in those

6

grades.
It is also important to bear in mind here an

7

8

understanding of what Judge WcKillan did, the procudure

9

that was followed.

That procedure, of course, was the

10

bifurcated procedure, recognized, approved, and, I

11

think, commended to the District Courts by this Court's

12

decision in Franks, and in Teamsters, and indeed it was

13

the procedure that was being utilized in General

14

Telephone versus EEOC, a decision of the Court a few

15

years ago.

16

Under the bifurcated

procedure, ordinarily the

17

primary question which is considered at the Stage One

18

hearing, the first trial, so to speak, is only whether

19

there is a pattern and practice of classwide

20

discrimination.

21

One that there is a pattern and practice of classwide

22

discrimination, then a second hearing is held to

23

determine to some extent in light of Mt. Healthy what

24

individuals were the victims of that discrimination and

25

which individuals were not.

If the court holds at the end of Stage

11

440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

On the other hand, if the court finds after

2

Stage One that there is no pattern and practice of

3

classwide discrimination, that is typically the end of

4

the class action.

5

QUESTION;

Mr. Schnapper, from the point of

6

view of class action litigation as opposed to whether

7

the Attorney General can bring the action, how are the

8

class plaintiffs benefitted by a Stage One determination

9

that there was a pattern and practice if in Stage Two

10

they have to show the circumstances of their individual

11

job actions?

12

MR. SCHNAPPER;

Well, the burden of proof is

13

different at Stage Two.

14

Stage One that there was a pattern and practice of

15

discrimination, then at Stage Two the burden of proof is

16

on the employer to show that particular individual

17

employees were not the victims of discrimination.
QUESTION;

18
19

If the plaintiff establishes at

What is the basis for that shift in

the burden of proof?
MR. SCHNAPPER;

20

The Footnote 24 in the Court's

21

decision in Franks, and there is a similar footnote in

22

the decision in Teamsters, both of which adopt that

23

rule.

1

MR-. SCHNAPPER;

Well, in the manner in which

2

these cases are typically tried, all the class members

3

are sort of — are putative candidates for relief unless

4

the defendant comes forward and attacks them.

5

that, as a practical matter, is how Stage Two will be

6

tried.

7
8

I mean

If there are 150 class members —
QUESTION;

Well, if you prove a pattern and

practice of discriminating against a minority, there
doesn't have to be any further proof to warrant some

10
11

kinds of relief, does there?
MR. SCHNAPP.ER;

No, that would result in a

12

finding of liability for all the individuals, unless at

13

Stage Two the company came forward and established that

14

despite this practice, particular individuals had not

15

been the victim of that discrimination.

16

Justice Powell's case, a hypothetical, one might

17

establish at Stage One that there was a pattern and

18

practice of disciplining only black employers.

1

QUESTION;

For example, in

Well, can a court order — Without

20

any proof of any individual discrimination, can a court

21

order after there has been proof of a pattern and

22

practice of racial discrimination, can a court order the

23

employer to bring his level of minority employment up to

24

a certain point?

25

MR. SCHNAPPER;

QUESTION:

10

Right,

How about a specific order that

Jones be hired?

11

MR. SCHNAPPER:

As the bifurcation procedure

12

is now administered, that would only -- that order would

13

only ehter following Stage Two, at which the company

14

would be given the opportunity to prove Jones out of the

15

case.

16

might want to think of as a Mt. Healthy here.

17

opportunity for the company to come forward and say,

18

even though we had a general policy of discrimination,

1

it wasn’t responsible for our refusal to hire Smith.

20

They are given that procedural opportunity at Stage

21

Two.

22

In other words, the company — Stage Two you

2

QUESTION:

Does he have to claim individual

discrimination against him?

3

MR. SCHNAPPER:

At some point we have to be

4

talking very specifically about what was found at Stage

5

One.

6

exampLe, everyone who applied in 1960 was -- 1970 was

7

rejected on race, on the basis of race, presumptively

8

any black in that group gets 1970 seniority, subject to

9

the right of the company at the Stage Two Mt. Healthy

10

If there is a finding at Stage One that, for

hearing to prove him out of the case.
QUESTION:

11

Right.

So In effect on your

12

statement there he has already proved that — under that

13

finding he has already proved that he was discriminated

14

against -MR. SCHNAPPERs

15

Hell, he has shifted the

16

burden of proof to the defendant.

17

required to come forward — has an opportunity to come

18

forward with additional evidence at Stage Two with

19

regard

to individuals.
QUESTION:

20

The defendant is

But the bottom line is that whoever

21

has got the burden,* the bottom line before the court

22

gives any individual relief is that he has to have been

23

discriminated against.
MR. SCHNAPPER;

24
25

times.

That remains the issue at all

That’s correct.

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-B300

1

Well, in any event, that is the procedure that

2

was followed here, as in most Title 7 cases.

3

contention, and this is the central issue in the case,

4

that although the district judge in the Cooper class

5

action decided that there was no pattern and practice of

6

racial discrimination in Grade 6 and above, he did not

7

resolve at all the claims of Baxter or the other Baxter

8

plaintiffs.

9

It is our

We rely in particular on three opinions by the

10

district judge.

11

October 29th, 1980, the judge with regard to Grades 6

12

and above said offly that the evidence of classwide

13

discrimination was not "pervasive enough" to order

14

classwide relief, a decision obviously limited to the

15

classwide liability issue.

16

October decision of Baxter or any of the other Baxter

17

plaintiffs.

18

First, in the judge’s opinion of

There is no mention in the

Second, on May 29th, 1981, in denying Baxter

19

the right to intervene in Cooper, the District Court

20

emphasized that it had held in Cooper only that there

21

was no classwide discrimination, and the word

22

"classwide" is part of the sentence in which it

23

describes its findings about Grade 6 and above.

24
25

Finally, twice, both on May 8th, 1981, and on
May 29th, 1981, the district judge made it clear that on

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

his view, Baxter was free to go out and file her own

2

lawsuit.

3

no reason why Baxter ooulin*t bring a fresh lawsuit.

In its May 29th order, the judge said he saw

4

Now, Judae McMillan is certainly sufficiently

5

familiar with the principles of res judicata that if he

6

had just decided the merits of Baxter's claims, he

7

wouldn *t have written an opinion which said he could see

8

no reason why she couldn't bring a whole new lawsuit and

9

start all over again.
QUESTION;

10

Mr. Schnapper, as I understand your

11

argument, even if that hadn't happened, your position is

12

that the Baxter plaintiffs should prevail.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

13

Well, it is our contention

14

that he never -- That's right.

15

The first one is that the Baxter plaintiff's claims were

16

never in fact resolved in Cooper.
QUESTION:

17
18

We have two arguments.

Then --

Regardless of what the judge said

or —
MR. SCHNAPPER:

19

Regardless of whether the

20

judge reserved the right for them to go forth.

21

right.

That's

We have two distinct arguments.
The bank relies primarily for its argument to

22
23

the contrary on the Conclusion of Law Number 27, which

24

is at 285 of the petitioners* appendix.

25

reads,

That conclusion

"The court concludes that there was no showing

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S4300

1

that the bank had discriminated against black employees

2

with respect to promotions cut of Grade 6 and above."

3

The bank reads that as meaning that the district judge

4

found there had never teen any acts of discrimination at

6

all in Grade 6 and above.

6

Me suggest that reading is clearly inaccurate

7

for several reasons.

as holding there was no classwide discrimination.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRIET S. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE U.S. AND EEOC AS AMICUS CURIAE
MS. SHAPIRO*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
The problem in this case can be illustrated by

18

considering the situation likely to face a class member

19

who receives notice of a class action.

20

has been denied a promotion because of his race.

21

does not know whether that race-based denial reflects a

22

companywide practice or only the racial bias of the

23

individual supervisor who denied him promotion.

He believes he

If it is the company policy, he can get relief
in the class action on proof of the general practice.

3

not typical of those of the class.

4

it is the particular racial bias of his own

The named plaintiffs in the class action can

5

present only the class claim based on the general

6

practice of the company that affects all class members

7

and any individual claims they may have.

8

challenge individual promotion decisions that do not

9

affect them.

10

They cannot

Of course, if the class succeeds in showing a

11

company practice of racially biased promotions, each

12

class member's claim is covered by that decision.

13

class member has no additional claim that he was also

14

denied a promotion because of his particular

15

supervisor's racial bias.

16

because of a lack of proof of a companywide practice of

17

racial discrimination, that failure says little about

18

whether the employee's claim that his own supervisor was

19

baised is valid or not.

A

But if the class claim fails

It is perfectly possible that the company has

his right to litigate that claim as the price of

2

remaining in the class that tests the related question

of whether there is a companywide practice of

discrimination.
It is no answer to say that the employee can

save his individual claim by intervening in the class

action.

litigation by representatives rather than by massive

intervention, and a class can be certified only when the

class is too large to make intervention by class members

The very purpose of class actions is to permit

If a class member must nevertheless intervene

to preserve his individual claim, the District Court,

faced with a class action and numerous intervention

17

practical benefits of the class procedure will be lost,

Nothing in Rule 23 requires the court to face

still litigate related individual claims that the class

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

1

NR. HODGES;

2
3

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

pleasa the Court.

I must say that I differ in two respects with

4
5

what petitioners have claimed to be the question here.

6

The question is not whether the judgment in the first

7

class action suit bars all subsequent actions brought by

8

class members who are in that suit.

9

Fourth

The decision of the

Circuit was far narrower than that.

10

That decision was simply that in a properly

11

certified class action, where notice was given to the

12'

class members, and they were adequately represented,

13

then they are precluded from raising in a separate suit

14

those issues or those claims that were within the range

15

of issues litigated in the first class action.
So, we do not claim, and the issue before this

16
17

Court,

I submit, on the Fourth Circuit’s opinion is not

18

whether all claims are barred.

19

QUESTIONj

Well, what if in the initial suit

20

there is proof of actual intentional discrimination

21

against two or three members of the class, but no other

22

proof and no other statistics that convince the judge,

23

and the judge says, well, there is just no pattern or

practice?

There is no pattern or practice.

MR. HODGES:

If that's the case, then it's not

a properly certified class action, and you'd be right.
QUESTION:

6

Well, but supposing that in

your supervisor hadn't been prejudiced against you, you

would have suffered from the companywide practice?
MR. HODGES:

If that's the case, I would say

14

you would be well advised to opt out and to pursue your

individual claims.
QUESTION:

16

But why should you have to opt out

if you think you would benefit from the determination

Now, as to the pattern and practice, I think

13

it is important to recognize that the pattern and

practice and the class action really is nothing but the

aggregation of these individual claims.

16

for instance, which recognizes that although there is no

17

pattern and practice, there may be individual cases.

18

One way of telling if there is a pattern and practice of

discrimination is to look at individual cases and see if

there is enough individual cases of discrimination to

conclude that that is the company's practice, the

It is a pattern if there is enough of it that — as
