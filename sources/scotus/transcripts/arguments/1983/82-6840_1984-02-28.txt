ON EEHA1F OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. HECTUS*

Mr. Chief Justice,

x
and may it

please the Court*
This case is here on petition for writ of

11

certiorari to the Supreme Court of Kentucky.

12

involved is whether cr not the trial court was

13

constitutionally required to admonish the jury that they

14

could draw no adverse inference from petitioner’s

15

failure to testify at his state criminal trial.

16

The issue

The Kentucky Supreme Court apparently applied

17

a procedural bar to the relief requested, relying on

18

this court’s decision in Carter v. Kentucky that

19

although an instruction was constitutionally compelled,

20

an admonition was not.

21

Court also ruled that as a matter of substantive

22

constitutional criminal procedure, that petitioner was

23

not entitled to an admonition regardless of Kentucky

24

evidentiary rules.

25

QUESTION*

Implicitly, the Kentucky Supreme

Was there anything to prevent

they are not, treating them as though they are

ME. EECTl'S;

6

Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice,

7

there is nothing requiring counsel from asking for

8

relief in the alternative.
QUESTION*

9

Nothing preventing him.

ME. HECTUSs

10

Nothing preventing him, and

11

certainly there was nothing preventing the trial ccurt

12

from performing its obligation that once it was put on

13

notice that the defendant wanted some sort of jury

14

guidance, no matter how that jury guidance is phrased,

15

whether as an admonition, an oral, authoritative

16

communication to the jury, or as an instruction in

17

writing containing the law cf the case, certainly I

18

think the judge was on notice as to the relief that the

19

defendant wanted.

20

think he had fair notice under the Kentucky rules cf

21

criminal procedure to go ahead and give the instruction

22

that is also mandated under these same rules upon finely

23

regues t.

25

If he thought it was improper, I

I think that this issue has great importance
because cf the fact that the petitioner in this case was

as to either the receiving stolen property or as to the

10

So in other words, at the time this case went to the

11

jury on the receiving stolen property charge, the only

12

thing

13

was in fact in possession of a handgun which had been

14

stolen.

15

was in any way knowing, and I think in that particular

16

case the absence of the admonition was critical.

that the jury had before them was evidence that he

There was no evidence shewing that possession

As to the burglary, the only evidence cf the

18

burglary of Hay 1,

1981 of the victim's residence

fingerprint on the inside of a door panel at

21

petitioner’s apartment.
QUESTION;

22

Well, when you emphasize one, would

23

it have made any difference if there were eight of

24

them?

25

ME. HECTUS;

I think it would have made a

their fingerprint on the in side cf a glass door panel as

9

opposed to, for example, a safe breaking case where a

10

defendant's fingerprints ar e found on the inside of a

11

safe to which he had nc leg al cr proper access.

12

in this case that fingerpri nt was certainly neutral as

13

to incriminating the defend ant.

MB. RECTUS:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice C’Ccnncr.
And counsel, for whatever reason,

3

did not request a written or present the court with a

4

written instruction in this regard?
ME. HECTUS:

5

6

to you

No, tut I would like to point out

-QUESTION:

7

And Kentucky law, I take it, is

8

perfectly clear that only written instructions will te

9

given and that counsel has to present written

10

instru ctions?
ME. HECTUS:

11

It is perfectly clear that the

12

trial court has an obligation to instruct the jury in

13

writing.

14

matter of state law that the defendant has to tender

15

written instructions in order to preserve that issue.

16

Kentucky rule of criminal procedure specifically

17

provides that the defendant can request an instruction

18

or by motion request an instruction cr object to an

19

instru ction.
Certainly here there was an adequate motion

20
21
22

It is not perfectly clear because it is ret a

made.
QUESTION;

And in Kentucky law — all right.

23

And in Kentucky law there has teen a distinction made,

24

has there not, between instructions and admonitions?

25

MR. RECTUS:

Absolutely.

An admonition has

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

been defined in Kentucky law as any authoritative

2

communication cf the court to the jury regarding their

3

duty or conduct as jurors.

4

regard

5

with regard to the defendant’s Fifth Amendment privilege

6

and the use to which the jury should put that has to do

7

with their duty as jurors.

8
9

I certainly think that with

to the Fifth Amendment privilege, an admonition

So I think that we come squarely within the
terms cf an admonition.

As a matter of fact, this Court

10

is well aware that oftentimes when Griffin errors are

11

committed by prosecutors with regard to comment on the

12

defendant's failure to testify, the appropriate relief

13

is for the court to admonish the jury that they can't

14

consider the defendant's failure to testify.

15

I certainly don't think that it would be

16

logical to have to wait for an error of that magnitude

17

before you are entitled as a matter cf constitutional

18

law to the relief that was requested in this case.

19

If I could get back procedurally, there are

20

some other important points that I think the Court ought

21

to consider with regard to the overall context of the

22

request for the instruction, its importance to this

23

case, and later with regard to the Commonwealth of

24

Kentucky's assertion of harmless error.

25

Cne, the judge did overrule defendant's motion

for severance.

2

extreme paucity of the Commcnwealth's evidence of the

burglary.

4

intention early on, prior to presentation of any

5

evidence,

6

with a prior forgery conviction.

7

persistent felony offender stage of this trial,

8

contested that that was in fact a felony conviction and

9

asserted that it was a misdemeanor conviction.

That was critical later on due to the

Furthermore, the prosecutor noted his

that he was going to impeach the defendant
The defendant in the

I think that it is implicit in the defendant's

10
11

failure to testify in this case that because the judge

12

was going to allow that forgery conviction which he

13

contested tc be used as impeachment, that that was a

14

consideration in his failure tc testify, so that we are

15

dealing with a reason, a likely inference for his

16

failure to testify that is unrelated to guilt or

17

innocence, and I think that that is an important

18

consid er ation.
During the voir dire, the defense counsel was

19
20

precluded from fully exploring with the jury their

21

feelings, their attitudes about the defendant's failure

22

to testify if in fact he did not testify.

23

counsel was allowed to inquire as to one juror's

24

attitude.

25

defense counsel attempted tc explore the rest of the

Defense

After exploring that attitude with the juror,

venire *s attitude toward that particular

2

consideration --

QUESTION;

3

Sometimes a judge's ruling on that

4

score in that stage is to prevent error getting into the

5

case right at the outset because of the view that that

6

is a good way, a good way to call attention to the

7

failure to testify by having a great deal of discussion

8

about it when they are picking a jury.
MR. HECTUS;

9

That may be. Nr. Chief Justice,

10

but I think in this point, the trial judge's response to

11

his attempt to do that was that the jurors have already

2

been instructed that they are to decide this case on the

3

law and the evidence.

4

repudiated that sort of admonition or instruction in

5

Carter as being a substitute for a full explanation as

6

to the defendant's right to not testify.

Not at all.

I'm not suggesting

that at all.

I think that the request for an admonition

in this case is a perfectly logical request.

QUESTION:

17

MR. HECTUSs

In Kentucky.
The reason I think

that the whole

18

notion of instructions and the request for the

19

admonition in Kentucky is net really important is

20

because the Kentucky practice, as this Court is aware I

21

think from cases like Taylor v. Kentucky, is to give

22

very spartan and skeletal instructions, in this Court’s

23

own language, they give very brief instructions which

24

have only to do with the elements of the crime, which

25

come right out of the statute book.

QUESTION :

were looking at the thing from some other planet, spare,

there are at least certain constitutional

prerequisites.

This Court indicated in Carter that the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

trial judge had an ctligaticn upon request to diminish

2

the possibility of the jury drawing any adverse

3

inference from the defendant's failure to testify.

4

If I could proceed on with seme of the

5

evidence in this case, which I also think has to do both

6

with the consideration of whether this should have teen

7

given and the consideration, given that it wasn’t,

8

whether it was harmless error —
QUESTION;

9

Mr. Hectus, before you do that, let

10

me just ask one question similar to the one Justice

11

Fowell

12

statement is the defendant requests, in the present

asked.

As I read the appendix, the critical

3

test,

that an admonition be given to the jury that no

4

emphasis be given to the defendant's failure to testify,

5

which was overruled, sort of internally inconsistent,

6

but you read that as indicating that in the instruction

7

conference, such a request was made and overruled.
MB. HECTUS;

8
9

I think that the Kentucky Supreme

Court and the Commonwealth of Kentucky per the Attorney

20

General's Cffice have assumed that that was the state of

21

affairs.

QUESTION;

that happened, he went ahead and gave the instructions.

MR. HECTUS;

Prior to instructions.
I mean, at the same time.
Prior tc instructions, right.

4

And in fact, the Court reads the instructions, as is the

5

federal practice, and then would give the instructions.

6

So the only thing — the defendant would have been

7

prejudiced, in fact, by not having that included in the

8

written instructions tc the jury, but certainly this

9

Court has indicated it *s unwilling to presume that

10

jurors do not listen tc the admonitions of the trial

I don't think that it’s novel.

I’m not sure whether it’s unusual.
Two state police officers, Trooper John Sparks

13

and Detective Claude Owen, very briefly testified as to

14

the arrest of the defendant.

15

to the Court that both those officers, in response tc

16

questicns by the prcsecutcr, made statements in front of

17

the jury as to the defendant’s exercise of his Fifth

18

Amendment privilege.

19

in response to a question, after advising the defendant

20

of his rights, he did not make any statement whatsoever

21

regarding anything.

22

in violation of Doyle v. Ohio that is unpreserved, but I

certainly think the Court should consider it in deciding

24

whether or not this error is harmless.

that counsel and the defendant requested some jury

I would like to talk briefly about what I

think are the constitutional underpinnings of this

case.

applied a federal statute precluding comment on a

constitutionalized in Griffin.

Obviously the Court's familiar with Wilson that

Wilson was
Bruno, which was a

10

precursor to Carter, mandated that upon request, a jury

11

be instructed as tc a defendant's failure to testify.

12

Also in Eruno, the Court held that it was not going to

13

apply the harmless error rule to that type of error

14

because it didn't have to dc with the mere etiquette of

15

trial rules.
In Kalloy v. Hogan, this court stated that a

17

defendant should suffer no penalty as a result of bis

18

exercise of his Fifth Amendment privilege.

20

that when a defendant either requests instruction on the

The

If I can move on to the procedural bar that

11

12

was applied by the Kentucky Supreme Court, they

13

basically stated that the defendant asked fcr the wrong

14

the rape charge tended to raise a reasonable doubt as tc

his presence at the scene cf the crime, and finally,

14

that if this Court’s statement in Lakeside and later in

Carter is true that an inference that the jury might

draw from failure tc testify as tc the defendant's guilt
