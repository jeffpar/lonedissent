PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Pollack, I think

you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL A. POLLACK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. POLLACK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether
a shareholder's action under Section 36(b) of the

10

Investment Company Act is exempt from the director

11

demand requirement of Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules

12

of Civil Procedure.

13

Underlying this seemingly narrow question

14

are several questions of perhaps more profound dimension,

15

some or all of which this Court may wish to consider.

16

First, what exactly is a derivative action

17

or, stated another way, what are the necessary and

18

sufficient conditions for a derivative action?

19

20
21

22
23

Second, what is the purpose of the director
demand requirement?
Third, does an investment company have an
implied right of action under Section 36(b)?
Petitioners' position in this case is that

24

the director demand requirement does apply to a share­

25

holder's action under Section 36(b) because the action

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

is derivative; that the director demand requirement

2

performs a most valuable function of permitting pre­

3

litigation resolution or adjustment of disputes, thus

4

avoiding needless litigation; and that the director

5

demand requirement is consistent with two long-standing

6

and salutary policies repeatedly upheld by this Court.

7

First, the exhaustion of intracorporate remedies, and,

8

second, letting directors direct.
The facts in this case may be simply summarized,

9
10

and they are in our blue brief.
The Daily Income Fund is a money market fund.

11
12

Reich & Tang are the investment advisors to Daily Income

13

Fund.

14

Fund.are disinterested directors; that is they are

15

in no way affiliated with or associated with the advisor.

A majority of the directors of Daily Income

In 1981, Martin Fox, a minority shareholder

16
17

of the Daily Income Fund, instituted an action against

18

Reich & Tang allegedly to recover excessive fees.

19

In doing so, he simply ignored the directors and by-passed

20

entirely the board.
Judge Kevin T. Duffy in the Southern;'.District

21

22

of New York dismissed his complaint for failure to

23

comply with the director demand requirement of Rule

24

23.1.

25

The Court of Appeals reversed and held that

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

no compliance was required, because the action was

2

not, in the words of the Court of Appeals, "strictly

3

speaking derivative."

4

The Court of Appeals reached this conclusion

5

because it said that the investment company itself

6

had no right of action under Section 36(b).

7

The Court of Appeals also went on to hold

8

in a supplementary holding that demand on the directors

9

would be, in its words, "an empty, unfruitful, and

10

dilatory exercise."

11

The starting point of the legal analysis

12

seems not to be in dispute.

13

governs all derivative, actions in the federal courts.

QUESTION:

The rule merely requires "that

the complaint shall allege with particularity to efforts,
if any, made by the Plaintiff to obtain the action
he desires of the director."

He didn't make any efforts,

did he?
MR. POLLACK:

Correct.

And, the failure

to do so has repeatedly been held by courts for many,
many years to be a basis for dismissing such an action.
QUESTION:

But, is that a matter of federal

law or state law?
MR. POLLACK:

I believe that is a matter

of federal law.
QUESTION:

Well, at least literally Rule

23 does not require a demand.

It merely requires a

a fact.
MR. POLLACK:

Well, we state in response

7

to that, Your Honor, that the courts have repeatedly

8

held that it is more than a mere pleading requirement,

9

that there is a substantive requirement of demand intended

10
11

by that rule.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest as a matter of

12

state law — Say the State of New York might provide

13

that there is no such requirement, it is an in New

14

York corporation to be a valid state law?

15

MR. POLLACK:

QUESTION:

20

I think that would be —

Could the State of New York do

that if it wanted to?
MR. POLLACK:

I think an action in the federal

court that would conflict with the policy of Rule 23.1.
QUESTION:

You think the State of New York

21

would not have the power to do that in view of the

22

way Rule 23 has been construed?

23

MR. POLLACK:

If the starting point is that Rule 23.1 does

That is my belief, Your Honor.

1

courts, the initial question becomes is a shareholder's

2

action under Section 36(b) derivative?
This Court has said that it is derivative

3
4

and Congress has said that it is derivative.
In the landmark case of Burks against Lasker

5

6

decided by this Court four years ago, Mr. Justice

7

Brennan, writing for the unanimous Court, stated as

8

a general proposition a derivative suit is brought

9

by shareholders to enforce a claim on behalf of a corpora­

10
11

tion.
QUESTION:

Mr. Pollack, we are not talking

12

about the meaning of the word "derivative," we are

13

talking about the meaning of the word "derivative"

14

as it is used in 23.1, right?

15

MR. POLLACK:

Yes, Your Honor.

16

More specifically and more importantly for

17

present purposes, Mr. Justice Brennan went on specifically

18

to refer to a suit under this very section, Section

19

36(b), as a derivative suit at page 484 of 441 U.S.

20

Mr. Justice Brennan stated for the unanimous Court,

21

and when Congress did intend to prevent board action

22

from cutting off derivative suits it said so expressly.

23

Section 36(b) added to the Act in 1970, performs

24

precisely this function for derivative suits charging

25

breach of fiduciary duty with respect to advisor fees.

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

That seems to me to be an unequivocal and unambiguous

2

recognition by this Court of the derivative nature

3

of the shareholder's action under Section 36(b).

4
5

6

Congress, as I said a moment ago, has also
characterized such actions as derivative.
In the 1970 House Report, which is cited

7

in our briefs, it is stated at page 78, "Section 19

8

of H.R. 14737 would add a requirement that derivative

9

suits under Section 36(b) of the Act as amended be

10

brought by shareholders acting in good faith and with

11

justifiable cause."

12

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Pollack, is it an essential

13

ingredient of being a derivative action that the corporation

14

could have brought suit on its own behalf?

15

MR. POLLACK:

The Court of Appeals held that

16

it was an essential ingredient.

17

our brief that it is not, because one possible construction

18

of Rule 23.1 is that the corporation have a right —

19

If, for example, the corporation has a state court

20

right, we, would argue that that is a right or a right

21

in this case not to be charged excessive fees which

22

complies with the literal language of Rule 23.1.

23

QUESTION:

We have argued in

So you adhere to the view that

24

you took in your brief, I take it, that in order for

25

an action to be a "derivative" action within the meaning

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

of Rule 23.1 one need not show that the corporation

2

could have sued on its own behalf?

3

MR. POLLACK:

We take that a back-up position.

4

We believe in this case that we have demonstrated and

5

can demonstrate to this Court that the corporation

6

could sue on its own behalf under Section 36(b).

7

One other cite to the legislative history

8

on the characterization of a 36(b) action as derivative

9

will be found at page 83 of that same 1970 House Report.

10

The Court of Appeals —

11

QUESTION:

You have been doing a lot of cross

12

referencing between legislative history, opinions of

13

this Court, language of the rule.

14

the term "derivative" as it is used in the rule?

15

MR. POLLACK:

How would you define

I believe that Justice Brennan's

16

definition in the Burks case is a satisfactory definition;

17

that is to say an action brought on behalf of a corporation

18

by a shareholder.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. POLLACK:

21

You were in that case I take it?
Yes, Your Honor, I did argue

before this Court in that case.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. POLLACK:

24

(Laughter)

25

MR. POLLACK:

Did you win?
Yes, Your Honor.

That is why I called it landmark,

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

2
3

That messes with your averages,

you know.

4

(Laughter)

5

MR. POLLACK:

I pondered that long and hard

6

when the writ of certiorari was granted in this case,

7

Your Honor.

8
9

The Court of Appeals, ignoring the evidence
of the derivative nature of a Section 36(b) action

10

which I have just cited to the Court, that is Justice

11

Brennan's statement in Burks and the House Report references

12

to an action as derivative, determined that this was

13

not a derivative action because the company itself

14

has no right of action under Section 36(b).

15

To unravel that error, one must look into

16

the question of whether an investment company has an

17

implied right of action under Section 36(b).

18

so we look —

19

20

QUESTION:

To do

Doesn't 36(b) provide in so many

words who may bring an action under it?

21

MR. POLLACK:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Why do you ever get to an implied

23

question then?

24

a suit may be brought, without saying who may bring

25

it, you probably have room for implied analysis under

If Congress just states generally that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Cort against Ash.

But, when Congress says this is

2

the kind of action that can be brought and it may be

3

brought by an (a), a (b), or a (c), isn't that pretty

4

well the ball game?

5

also a (d) could bring it?

How would you ever imply that

MR. POLLACK:

6

We believe that the recent

7

cases of this Court, and I think it is Cannon — I

8

may have juggled them in my mind — While I am standing

9

here, I will look before I rebut — stands for the

10

proposition that the fundamental purpose of the section

11

must be considered.

12

purpose of Section 36(b), which was enacted in 1970,

13

was to strengthen the hand and role of the independent

14

directors.

15

And, in this case, the fundamental

Looking first at the language to determine

16

whether there is an implied right, the section itself

17

says, in pertinent part, that a shareholder may sue

18

"on behalf of" the investment company.

19

that that is clearly suggestive of a derivative concept.

20

We believe

Turning to the legislative history, unfor­

21

tunately, as in many statutes, the legislative history

22

appears to be silent on the issue of an implied right

23

as regards the investment company itself.

24

Therefore, one must look in the terms of

25

the Merrill Lynch and Curran analysis to the state

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

of the law at the time Congress passed this section

2

in 1970.

3

And, the state-of-the-law was that there

4

was universal recognition of the derivative character

5

of a lawsuit to recovery excessive fees from an invest

6

ment advisor.

7

We hav * cited those cases at commonlaw and

8

also under Section 36 which preceded 36(b) at page

9

10 of our blue brief.

10

It follows necessarily that if those suits

11

were derivative prior to the enactment of this section

12

that they were derived from a primary right in the

13

investment company itself.

14

Congress is, of course, under the current

16

doctrine, presumed to know the state-of-the-law at

18

the time it enacted Section 36(b) and since there is

17

no evidence whatsoever of congressional intent to deny

18

or eliminate that right in the investment company,

19

we believe that the presumption should be applied that

20

Congress must have intended to preserve that right.

21

To do so is consistent with the overall intent of the

22

1970 amendments as I mentioned a moment ago.

23

overall intent was in part to strengthen the role of

24

the disinterested directors.

25

to imply a right in this situation because the fact

That

And, it makes good sense

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that a shareholder was granted a remedy to sue for

2

excessive fees should not mean that the same remedy

3

is not available to the investment company itself.

4

As we argue in the first page of our reply

5

brief, the yellow-covered brief, there is something

6

most anamolous about saying that an investment company,

7

if a new group of directors comes aboard, has no right

8

to sue its investment advisor if the directors feel

9

that there has been an overcharging merely because

10

a shareholder does not happen to raise the matter.

11

I find that a result that is almost unthink-

12

able in terms of interpreteing a sensible intent on

13

the part of Congress.

14

The Courts of Appeals went on in a supplementary

15

holding to hold that the application of the director

16

demand rule is inconsistent with the operation of Section

17

36(b).

18

We believe this too is erroneous.
The fact that the directors may perhaps not

19

be able to terminate a Section 36(b) action, a doctrine

20

that is much talked about in the industry as a result

21

of Mr. Justice Brennan's dictum in Burks does not —

22

QUESTION:

You didn't refer to Justice Brennan's

23

earlier statement in his opinion, the opinion for the

24

Court, as dicta.

25

the opinion and what comes out bad is dicta.

I take it what comes out right of

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

(Laughter)

2

MR. POLLACK:

No.

That is a fair criticism.

3

We can well live with this, be it holding or dictum,

4

because the fact is that the termination doctrine does

5

not obviate the benefit of the demand rule.

6

termination — The mere fact that directors may or

7

may not be able to terminate a Section 36(b) action

8

does not render nugatory the value of having a demand

9

rule here and that value is to prevent, before there

The

10

is litigation, unnecessary litigation, to let the directors

11

rethink the question as to whether there has been an

12

overcharge, to let the directors convince the shareholder

13

that perhaps he is wrong.

But, in any event, we believe that it is

14
15

a salutary rule.
QUESTION:

16
17

It goes both ways.

Well, couldn't the director start

to rethink as soon as the complaint is served?
MR. POLLACK:

18

Yes, but there is the Damoclesian

19

sword of the complaint hanging over their head and

20

we believe the purpose of the demand rule is to provide

21

for pre-litigation considerations, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

22

Just as the statute of limitations

23

is always looming in the background.

There is a limit

24

on the time that they can do their rethinking, isn't

25

it?

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

MR. POLLACK:

Yes, Your Honor, and that is,

2

in our judgment, the second error of the Court of Appeals

3

in this supplementary holding.

4

The statute of limitations, this one-year

5

statute provided by Section 36(b)(2) is not shortened,

6

it is simply advanced.

7

on January 1 of a given year a shareholder makes a

8

demand and the demand is responded to and the demand

To give a simple example, if

of January 1 to January 1.

12

period of is better, but, in any event, there is no

13

shortening of the period by this pre-litigation demand.

14

It is simply an advancing of the period.

At this point I will be seated and await
my rebuttal.

MR. MEYER:

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

I believe the starting point must be an analysis

2

of the statute, and as this Court has so frequently

3

said, the starting point for analyzing a statute is

4

the wording of the statute itself.

5

Section 36(b), which was enacted after years

6

of consideration and study by the Congress, expressly

7

provides for an action to be brought by any security

holder of an investment company or by the Securities

and Exchange Commission.

No mention is made in the statute of a right

I suggest in the context not only of the statute but

21

of the legislative history, it does not mean that the

22

company is the one to assert that right in the federal

23

court or any other court.

24
25

That does not necessarily mean, and

it is fairly reasonable to say that a suit by the stockholder

MR. MEYER:

The statute indeed says that

the suit is on behalf of the company.
QUESTION:

Yes.

And, you could certainly

8

argue that it is a derivative of the company right.

9

It depends upon the company's right.

10

MR. MEYER:

Well, the statute also says that

11

the suit that may be brought by the Securities and

12

Exchange Commission is on behalf of the company.

13

recovery will go to the company.

14

anyone would seriously argue that the Securities and

15

Exchange Commission in enforcing the public policy

16

of the United States as enunciated in this statute

17

would be obliged to make a demand upon the directors

18

of the company before it were permitted to proceed

19

with an action to vindicate the public interest.

20

And, I suggest —

QUESTION:

Mr. Meyer, may I interrupt again?

22

I don't think the statute says the words "on behalf

QUESTION:

9

MR. MEYER:

I see.
And, I can't visualize any other

10

type of result.

It certainly wouldn't go into the

11

United States Treasury.
I think, in looking at the legislative history,

12

13

that Mr. Pollack stated that the principal purpose

14

of Section 36(b) was to strengthen the role of the

15

independent directors.

16

the case.

17

I believe that is not at all

The legislative history contains repeated

18

references to the inadequacy of the independent directors.

19

It contains repeated references to the desire of Congress

20

to entrust the enforcement of rights against investment

21

advisors to security holders, not just shareholders,

22

but all security holders, and to the Securities and

23

Exchange Commission.

24
25

The legislative history is replete with references
to the fact that advisory fees by investment advisors

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

to mutual funds and other investment companies had

2

been excessive.

3

The legislative history repeatedly asserts

4

that not only have the directives been ineffective

5

in reducing these fees, but also the so-called disclosure

6

requirements under the Act have been ineffective and

7

the asserted competition which the investment company

8

institute maintained was effective was indeed no effective

9

in reducing advisory fees under the Act.

10

Now, what did Congress provide with respect

11

to this rather important function that my adversary

12

assigns to the strengthening of directives?

13

essentially three things.

14

It did

It broadened the definition of affiliated

15

directors, changed the terminology to call them interested

16

directors, and expanded the definition of who would

17

be an interested director to include, for example,

18

a member of the immediate family of someone on the

16

investment advisor, to include someone who had a substantial

20

financial relationship with the investment advisor

21

such as counsel, general counsel to the investment

22

advisor.

23
24
25

I submit that is hardly a major legislative
move.
The other areas in which they acted to strengthen

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

the role of the independent directors consisted of

2

a provision providing that in evaluating the advisory

3

contract the affiliated directors must provide and

4

the unaffiliated directors must receive such information

5

as would be sufficient in order to pass upon the invest­

6

ment addvisory contract.

7

I submit that that is hardly an extension

8

over the pre-existing law.

The Second Circuit had

9

held in — I believe it was in 1961 in Brown versus

10

Bullock that the approval of an advisory contract must

11

not be merely formal but must evidence a substantive

12

judgment on the part of the directors.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MEYER:

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Meyer?
Yes.
What inference do you ultimately

16

draw from your different view of the legislative history

17

of the 1970 amendment?

18

MR. MEYER:

The inference that I draw from

19

my view of the legislative history of the 1970 amendment

20

was that this was a concerted effort extending over

21

a period of years beginning as early as 1958 when the

22

Wharton study was commissioned by the SEC under the

23

egis of Congress and continuing right up to 1970.

24

There were intermediate reports by the SEC, a special

26

study in 1963, the Public Policy Report in 1966, all

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

of which went to the proposition that there must be

2

effective means for the federal courts to pass upon

3

the propriety of advisory fee compensation in the

4

investment company field and that those effective means

5

were not being provided by the independent directors

6

and could not in the nature of things be provided by

7

the independent directors and that stockholder and

8

SEC action was required to do that.
Let me add to that one important reason why

9
10

this is so in the investment company field/as distinguished

11

from the corporate area generally.
Congress was faced with an existing situation

12

13

where the vast majority of investment companies were

14

managed not by their own internal staffs but by external

15

investment advisors.

16

upon these external investment advisors because rhese

17

people had sponsored the fund, they sold shares of

18

the fund, and there was no practical way for the directors,

19

as independent as they might be, to negotiate meaningfully

20

with them.

21

They were extremely dependent

Congress decided, and they did have an alternative,

22

they could have prohibited external investment advisors.

23

They chose to stay with the existing system.

24

in doing so, they said we must take effective means

25

to ensure that this conflict of interest which is built

But,

23
ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

in by the very structure must have a check and balance

2

and that check and balance is an action by the security

3

holder and by the SEC which will be ultimately passed

4

upon by the court.

5

Now, I would like to respond to a point raised

6

in Petitioners' reply brief on page one.

It was also

7

a point that the First Circuit raised and that is that

8

if a new board of directors comes in and decides to

9

bring an action against an expelled investment advisory,

10

it would be unthinkable that they would be powerless

11

to do so under the statute.

12

are three answers to that.

I would suggest there

13

The first answer I have already gone into

14

in some length and that is that what we are dealing

15

with here is congressional intent.

16

the years preceding the enactment of the 1970 amendment

17

nor in the years since has a board of directors of

18

an investment company brought an action for excessive

19

advisory fees against its investment advisor.

20

fact was called to Congress' attention during the legis­

21

lative history.

22

that this was a realistic possibility in enacting the

23

statute and when the statute is interpreted it must

24

be interpreted against the background of what Congress

25

assumed to be, and rightfully so, the likely situation;

Never in all of

This

They could not possibly have conceived

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

where directors of a mutual company are the very ones

2

who have approved the contract that is in issue, and,

3

therefore, it becomes a functionless act to demand

4

them to bring suit against the advisor on a contract

5

that they have already determined presumably to be

6

fair and adequate.

7

If, however, there should be such a change

8

in management and a change in heart that the directors

9

of the investment company decide that something must

10

be done about the old investment advisor who is no

11

longer there, they still have two additional remedies.

12

Number one, they could request the SEC to

13

bring an action.

14

could not be lightly assumed that the SEC in the exercise

15

of its statutory functions would be derelict if the

16

directors did, in fact, have sufficient reason to make

17

that type of request.

18

And, I would think that the — It

Finally, I think that in virtually every

19

case, and certainly in the present case, the so-called

20

non-interested directors are usually shareholders.

21

In this case, they are all shareholders of the fund.

22

So, they could bring an action as a shareholder, just

23

as Mr. Fox brought the action in this case.

24

not powerless.

25

we have suggested.

They are

They can act through the means that

25
ALDER30N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Finally, I would like to stress the point

2

that although we claim that the investment company

3

does not itself have a right of action, and, therefore,

4

under Rule 23.1, which requires merely that an allegation

5

be made concerning demand where a corporation has a

6

right which it fails to assert.

7

In addition to that we also argue that even

8

if the investment company does have a right of action

9

that the intent of Congress and, indeed, the language

10

of this Court in Burks against Lasker suggests that

11

there need be no demand upon the directors to bring

12

the action.

13

My adversary refers to the statement in Burks

14

against Lasker as dictum.

15

as applying merely to a termination case.

16

actual language which this Court used and while there

17

were two separate concurring opinions, there were no

18

dissents, so that the decision was unanimous.

19

language that this Court used was to the effect that

20

when Congress decided to prevent directorial action

21

from cutting off, and those are the words that are

22

used, cutting off shareholder actions, it knew how

23

to do so and it did so in Section 36(b).

24
25

He refers to the statement
Now, the

The

And, by way of analogy, the Court cited in
a footnote, Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act, stating

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that this Act permits shareholder action notwithstanding

2

the decision of the directors not to bring suit.
With respect to the suggestion that dispensing

3
4

with a demand requirement would result in the bringing

5

of unwarranted strike suits, this was an issue that

6

was raised before Congress.

7

be swayed by that argument and, indeed, I think that

8

the demand requirement really has little, if anything,

9

to do with the so-called strike suit.
The demand requirement is over 100 years

10
11

Congress chose not to

old.

It can be traced back to Hawes versus Oakland.
The abuses arising out of shareholder liti­

12

13

gation arose in the early part of this century and

14

they were remedied or attempted to be remedied by the

15

most part by providing for — providing that no corporate

16

action could be dismissed, no derivative action could

17

be dismissed absent notice to shareholders and court

18

approval.

19

to be used to counter the so-called strike suits.
I submit that they have been extremely success­

20
21

22

Those were the methods that were sought

ful.
Finally, again, although I have said several

23

finallies, but one further point with respect to this

24

so-called distinction between termination and demand.

25

In the Third Circuit case, Weiss versus Temp

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Fund, Judge Becker was trying to square the decision

2

in that case with the earlier decision of the Third

3

Circuit in Lewis versus Curtis in which the Third Circuit

4

had held that the exact same standards that apply to

5

termination apply to demand.

6

Judge Becker said that he agreed with Lewis

7

versus Curtis insofar as it held that, but said Judge

8

Becker, because this Court in Burks against Lasker

9

applied a conclusive presumption to what he regarded

10

as a termination situation and because the two situations

11

were factual situations he would not apply an equally

12

conclusive presumption to the demand question.
Now, I submit that given that the two situations

13
14

involved, as logic compels that they are involved,

15

namely — The logic that I am referring to is that

16

what we are really asking here is what is the function

that distinction in the Weiss case, I suggest that

it really doesn't carry very much water and should

be rejected by this Court.

You brought this complaint?

That is correct.
Is that the money market fund?
That is the fund, yes, sir.
And, why did you name the Daily

Income Fund.

13

MR. MEYER:

I named the fund, and I may have

14

made a mistake, but I named the fund because I read

15

the statute as reading that the recovery would go to

16

the fund and that the judgment, in order to be complete,

17

ought to include the beneficiary of the judgment.

what?

Could it be realigned as a Plaintiff or what?
MR. MEYER:

2

This issue has arisen many times

3

in derivative actions and in diversity actions as well.

4

Just through sheer habit and the length of time in

5

which these suits are brought, it is customary to name

6

them, since they are not. a willing Plaintiff, to name

7

them as a Defendant, but I think that is purely a formal

8

matter.
QUESTION:

9

I take it in ordinary derivative

10

actions the failure to, if there has been a failure,

11

to go to the board to comply with, Rule 23 can be taken

12

advantage of and asserted by a third party who sued?
MR. MEYER:

13

That is quite correct and, in

14

fact, I think that is another reason why it is apparent

15

that no such requirement was.intended by Congress in

10

this case because by virtue of the statute virtually

17

every investment company has a majority of unaffiliated

18

directors and that would in effect nullify the statutory

19

purpose behind Section 36(b), which was to, as I said

before, give shareholders or security holders indeed

and the SEC the right to challenge excessive advisory

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL A. POLLACK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. POLLACK:

Mr. Meyer would set at naught

4

or ascribe little value to the independent directors

5

of the mutual fund and suggests that Congress did so

6

in the legislative history.

7

We believe otherwise.

Footnote 15 at page 485 of 442 U.S. represents

8

a summation of the legislative history by Justice Brennan

9

in which he concludes with this observation:

"Congress

10

surely would not have entrusted such critical functions

11

as approval of advisory contracts and selection of

12

accountants to the statutorially disinterested’ directors

13

had it shared the Court of Appeals' view that such

14

directors could never be disinterested where their

15

codirectors of investment advisors were concerned."

16

Similarly at pages 4900 and 4903 of the Senate

17

Report, there is amply supporting reference to our

18

position that a central purpose of these amendments

19

of 1970 was to strengthen the disinterested directors.

20
21

22

Mr. Meyer seeks to simply treat them as if
they are not there.
Secondly, Mr. Meyer suggests that if there

23

is no right in the investment company the directors

24

are not rendered powerless because they can go to the

25

SEC and ask them to sue or they can bring an action

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

as shareholders themselves.

with the functions of directors.

3

direct.

4

corporate law with which I am familiar and ask the

5

SEC to do their work for them.

6

Well, that is not consistent
Directors are to

They need not go to the SEC under any state

And, similarly there is no requirement that

7

they be shareholders of the investment company in order

8

to serve as directors.

9

second solution is inadequate.

10

QUESTION:

Therefore, I suggest that this

Could I ask you, before Rule 23.1

11

comes into play, it assumes that the corporation or

12

association has failed to enforce a right?

13

MR. POLLACK:

14

QUESTION:

15

You say in this case the fund

has failed to exercise a right.

16
17

Correct.

MR. POLLACK:

I don't suggest that at all.

They were not given the opportunity to —

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. POLLACK:

Yes, it says had it failed.
There is a dispute, of course,

20

between the parties as to whether they have failed

21

and that is the very function of the demand rule, to

22

enable a dialogue to go forward and for the directors

23

to say —

24
25

QUESTION:

Assuming we disagreed with you

and assuming we thought that there was no right in

32
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the firm to sue under Section 36, to sue the advisor

2

under 36, that it just couldn't exercise any right

3

under the statute to sue.

4

MR. POLLACK:

Then what about Rule 23?

We have argued as a back-up

5

position in our brief that we are still within the

6

language of Rule 23.1, because we have a right not

7

to be charged excessive fees.

8

under Section 36(b).

9

QUESTION:

It may not be a right

It may be you have a right, but

10

you say — but the rule says you have to fail to enforce

11

it and so — But, if you have no right to enforce the

12

right, if you have no cause of action to enforce the

13

right under the statute, what then, do you turn to

14

state law?

15

MR. POLLACK:

16

QUESTION:

Okay.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Pollack, may I ask one question

Yes.

18

about the second of your two responses to the point

19

that the other remedies, that the directors might go

20

to the SEC or they might be shareholders themselves.

21

MR. POLLACK:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Isn't it also possible your response

23

to the latter is they don't have to be shareholders

24

and, of course, that is true, but would it not also

25

be conceivable, if they thought they had a good case

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

and they were willing to finance it with corporate

2

funds, that they could fine the shareholder and assure

3

him that the corporation would pay the expenses of

4

litigation even though the corporation couldn't litigate

5

directly?
MR. POLLACK:

6

I suppose that is a theoretical

7

possibility, but if those directors were lawyers that

8

would get them into quite a bit of hot water ethically.

9

QUESTION:

Do you think that would be an

10

ethical problem if they thought there was a clear violation

11

and that the corporation would benefit from the action?

12

MR. POLLACK:

I would not want to be a director-

13

lawyer and be someone seeking a plaintiff to bring

14

a lawsuit.

15

QUESTION:

16

All directors aren't lawyers.

Say you had non-lawyer directors.

there was quite a bit to it.

you know of to having the directors go to the court

3

with a motion to intervene on behalf of the corporation

the prudential aspect.

6

but any bar that you know for doing that?

7

MR. POLLACK:

Is there any bar that

I am talking about

It perhaps is a novel motion,

I think, Mr. Chief Justice,

8

that that gets into the issue raised by Justice Brennan's

9

statement about cutting off.

The argument would be

10

made if they can't cut it off, then they can't intervene

11

for the purpose of cutting it off.

12

would be —

13

QUESTION:

And, I think there

They aren't intervening to cut

14

it off, they are intervening to assert the corporation's

15

right along with the plaintiff, whether he is derivative

16

or whatever.

17

MR. POLLACK:

I suppose in theory that is

18

possible that the directors could seek to intervene.

19

Of course, that would — on behalf of the corporation.

20

I should think that that would necessarily imply, if

21

they can do that, that they do have — or that the

22

investment company does have a right of action under

23

Section 36(b) and that they are asserting it in litigation.

MR. POLLACK:

2

QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.

If the Fund hadn't been named

3

at all as a defendant, would you have been in this

4

case?

MR. POLLACK:

MR. POLLACK:

QUESTION:

What?

What would you have done, intervened

MR. POLLACK:

QUESTION:

MR. POLLACK:

15

No.

You say if Daily Income

Fund had not been named as a defendant at all?

12

14

Yes, because the —

or —

10
11

Yes.

Yes.
I suppose I would not be here

today.
QUESTION:

Well, you are here just representing

16

what is called the nominal defendant and you are asserting

17

that you really don't — the Fund really doesn't care

18

to have any recovery from the —

19

MR. POLLACK:

We are asserting that the company

20

has a right to determine whether the litigation shall

21

proceed in the first instance and —

25

QUESTION:

Well, do you think you are any

more than a nominal defendant whatever that means?
MR. POLLACK:

I think that the Fund has an

important function in this circumstance and is represented

by the independent directors.

had met with Mr. Fox, several things might have happened.

3

Mr. Fox might have been convinced —

4

QUESTION:

If the independent directors

That may be true, but the company's

5

position in this case — The only possible reason for

6

it being a defendant or being a party at all is so

7

it is in the case to receive the money if there is

8

some money.

9

MR. POLLACK:

As a defendant, it in theory

10

cannot receive that money and that, I suppose, goes

11

to the question you asked Mr. Meyer about whether they

12

are improperly aligned.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. POLLACK:

15

QUESTION:

16

They can receive it though —
If there is a recovery.

I take it you participated all

the way through the courts?

17

MR. POLLACK:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. POLLACK:

Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you.
The final point about Mr. Meyer's

20

argument, the use of Section 16(b) as an analogy, we

21

think is inapt, because Section 16(b) has its own demand

22

rule.

23

I would say that, if I may in conclusion,

24

that the blanket and what we view as absolutist disabling

25

of the independent directors of investment companies

by the Second Circuit, which the Second Circuit imposed

2

in Burks and which was repudiated by this Court in

3

Burks, has arisen once again.

4

The Second Circuit in this case, for whatever

5

reason, seems to have either failed to grasp or decline

6

to follow the logic and spirit of this Court's opinion

7

in Burks and we believe that the Second Circuit should

8

be reversed once again.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

the case is submitted.
We will hear arguments next in Pulley against
