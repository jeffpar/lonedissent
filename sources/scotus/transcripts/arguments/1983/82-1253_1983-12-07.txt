Hr. Attorney General/

please the Courts

8

This is another Eigth Circuit case and the

9

procedural history is basically that there was an en

10

banc hearing in 1982 before all the judges of the Eigth

11

Circuit asking them to review a prior decision in the

12

Janis case.

13

certiorari from that decision on January 25, 1983. This

14

Court granted it on Hay 31.

The State of South Dakota filed a writ of

I should advise the Court that there are two

15
16

contrary holdings by the South Dakota Supreme Court,

17

contrary to the Eigth Circuit’s decision and in the face

prior decision.

flooding of certain areas which caused people to move to

Yes.

It is a checkerboarded area.

Is the seat of the tribal

government on the land?
MR. MEIERHENRY*

The seat of tribal government

17

is at Eagle Butte, South Dakota which is off the

18

reservation, and this was done for again a number of

19

factual reasons, it being that area of the country where

20

it was the only town of any relative size having a

21

communications center and so forth.

22

reasons why the federal government chose Eaale Butte

23

and, of course, once the federal government chooses it

24

usually the tribal government follows as a center.

There are many

reservations in South Dakota.

the street in December 1908, and Senator Gamble

Were I a counsel for that committee I might

6

7

remind

the committee as followsx

that in 1904 this

8

committee diminshed Gregory County which is found on map

9

4 of the handout; that in 1906 Senator Gamble once again

10

introduced a bill to diminish Trip County, South Dakota

11

and the facts there this committee sent out to South

12

Dakota Colonel McLaughlin to consult with the Indians.

13

The committee would have probably been reminded tha this

14

Court in Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock had held that Congress

15

need no longer have agreement but could unilaterally

16

diminish a reservation.
With that in mind that is what we did in

17
18

Gregory County which is found on map 4.

The committee

19

probably would have been reminded that the bill being

20

introduced and as usual the committee asking the

21

Commissioner of Indian Affairs for their advice and as

22

usual Senator McLaughlin was sent to consult with the

23

Indians, that this Court dimished Gregory County and in

24

March of 1907 passed a bill which diminished Trip

26

County .

It is now in December of 1907.

1

The Act

2

concerning Standing Rock and Cheyenne Fiver Reservation

3

was introduced, and again if you will remember that we

4

sent Colonel McLaughlin to consult with the Standing

5

Rock Indians and the Indians of the Cheyenne River

6

Reservation that you will recall Senator McLaughlin took

7

a blue pencil in those consultations and drew the

8

boundaries of the reservation.

9

that they would have two separate dimished reservations,

10

and we passed a bill to that effect.
QUESTION :

11
12

He informed the Indians

He was kind of the professional

negotiator all through

these years, was he not?

MR. MEIERHENRY:

13

He was the agent for the

14

United

States govermment, and as the map will show he

15

was the person who went out and consulted with the

16

Indians in Gregory and Trip County which this Court has

17

held diminished in our case here today and eventually in

18

Bennett and Millet Counties which came later.
The historical whimsy that I am attempting to

19
20

weave so to speak is to show basically that the

21

committee, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, that

22

discussed these bills was used to this type of

23

operation, the 1908 bill before you today, in 1904,

24

1907,

25

continuous process.

the case in question we have,

1908, was a

Of course, as this Court has

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

indicated in Dakota and Rosebud it is what Congress

2

intended to do by its Ret, and in order to find that we

3

have to look at the surrounding circumstances for one

4

thing.
We have to look at the face of the Act which I

5
6

submit to the Court today is clear in light of your

7

Rosebud decision.
QUESTIONj

8

9

There are different facts are there

not?

10

NR. MEIERHENRY:

11

QUESTIONS

12

13

In this 1908 case?

There is language of cession and

agreement in Rosebud.
MR. MEIERHENRY.*

Rosebud I believe this Court

14

made the transition that is important.

15

that the 1904 Gregory County Act did have these words of

18

cession, but if you will look at the Trip County Act

17

which is found on map 4 and the Act here today the

18

operative words are "sell" and "dispose", and this Court

19

held in Rosebud that the 04 Act concerning Gregory

20

County and the 07 Act which had the same exact language

21

as we have in the 08 Act was the functional twin, that

22

the recognition of Lone Wolf and the unilateral action

23

came into play.

24
25

The Court said

So in looking at the acts that have already
been decided that affect South Dakota, that Act of 04,

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

07, and the two in 1910 we have the same operative

2

language in four of them, "sell and dispose of a portion

3

of the reservation".

4

dispose of a portion of the Pine Ridge Reservation."

6

One says Cheyenne River.

6

says Rosebud.

One of the bills says "sell and

One says Eagle Butte.

One

So that is a similar factor.

Also the school lands issue is a functional

7

8

twin of these cases.

South Dakota being a state that

9

came in in 1889 got Section 16 and Section

36 as school

10

lands,

and when a reservation was dimished the Indian

11

tribe had to be paid for this land because the agreement

12

between the State of South Dakota and the federal

13

government was they were to get these two school land

14

sections.
tfost of the debate on this bill of 1908

15
16

concerned the payment — or much of it I should say —

17

concerned the payment by the federal treasury to the

18

state for these school lands.

That is similar.

The other thing that is of utmost importance

19
20

and as the Court pointed out in Rosebud is that the

21

federal government had no duty to pay the state until

22

such time as the reservation is extinguished, and once

23

it is extinguished then there is a requirement to be

24

paid.

25

through this committee at that time that they had a duty

They felt in all of these acts that were going

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-M00

1

to pay South Dakota because their intent was to

2

disestablish the reservation and extinguish it thereby

3

causing there to be a payment.

4

The usual language also had to do with what I

5

will term the exchange provision, that being that since

6

the Indian country was being reduced those Indian people

7

who had allotments in the area that was to be diminished

8

had the right and should be consulted of whether they

9

wished to move back onto the closed portion of the

10

reservation.

The face of the Act is clear on that

11

portion, and the intent of Congress because in referring

12

to this right to move back it states that they may take

13

an allotment anywhere within the respective reservations

14

thus dimished to which the reservation may belong.
So on the face of the Act especially in light

15
16

of Rosebud we have the same operative language that this

17

Court has passed upon in three other Acts, to sell and

18

dispose.

19

this Court has disposed of in three other cases.

20

Also the school lands provision is found that

The taking of allotments has been decided in

21

two other Acts.

Now one thing that is also important

22

and the committee would have been told it was different

23

would be this.

24

a provision that states — It is a practical provision

25

that leaps into legislation whether it is at the state

On the face of this Act of 1908 there is

10

AL0ER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

level or the federal level.
There must have been a request by the Indian

2
3

tribe that they be allowed to cut timber until the land

4

was settled until a settler came and actually was on the

5

land.

6

That is found on the face of the Act.
Congress said by using this language that they

7

may cut this timber in a certain area only as long as

8

the lands remain part of the public domain, and this

9

public domain language was found significant in the

10

Seymour case which we believe supports the State's

11

position that the reservation was dimished.

12

So just as this Court said that the 1904

13

Gregory County Act was a functional twin — or the 1907

14

Trip County Act was a functional twin to the 04 Act we

15

believe that this Act is a functional twin to the Trip

16

County Act and should be treated by this Court in the

17

same way because those that are familiar as this Court

18

is with the legislative process -- We had a whole string

19

as we pointed out in these maps of cases from South

20

Dakota all introduced by Senator Gamble of South Dakota.

21

In each and every case the correspondent

22

between the City of Washington and the State of South

23

Dakota was McLaughlin.

24

the Senate Committee his report of what occurred, and

26

that is in the record, of course, here.

In each case they appended to

11

Here he makes very clear that he took a blue

1

2

pencil and as it is pointed out on map 5 he took a blue

3

pencil and he explained to the people out there because

4

they knew after Lone Wolf he no longer had to have an

5

agreement.

6

blue pencil and he showed the Indian people out there

7

where there reservation would be.
He told them that this may be the best you can

8

9

They told him to consult/ and he took that

do to save the red area because there are right now

10

people who want to take away the whole thing.

There was

11

not an agreement because there did not need to be an

12

agreement, and Congress knew there did not need to be an

13

agreem ent.
It was a consultation as to what would occur.

14
15

That is exactly what happened on the next two when

10

Bennett County and other counties were dimished.
So from the legislative process we can see

17
18

what the legislative intent was, and this Court has

19

found

that legislative intent on either side.

20

thing

that I would like to mention because there is much

21

made in Respondent's brief is what has been the

22

treatment of this area.

23

The other

As this Court said in Rosebud perhaps the

24

single most salient fact is the assumption of

25

jurisdiction by the state shortly thereafter.

Dakota had exercised jurisdiction over this area clearly

2

from 1911 until the Eigth Circuit Court of Appeals*

decision in 1972.
Since that time there has been controversy.

It needs to be settled.

It was considered by all

The United States Attorney for the District of

14
15

South Dakota in 1973 in the case that was before the

16

17

briefs — a clear indication that at least in 1973 the

18

The most clear way that I can state it is by

21

quoting a brief sentence out of the Stankey v. Waddell

22

case of our Supreme Court, the South Dakota Supreme

23

Court,

24

jurisdiction over unalloted land within the opened area

25

after LaPlant in 1911 and consistently maintained such

Of course, the Solicitor General is

I believe the United States government as

However, in light of Rosebud we think the law

It should be clear.

There is

10

nothing to show that there was any change of

11

congressional intent between the spring of 1908 and the

12

fall of 1908 or the year 1907.
So for all of those reasons the State of South

13

/

14

Dakota

would urge this Court that nothing would appear

15

in the legislative history, the surrounding

16

circumstances to indicate any other intent of Congress

17

no matter the rightness of its cause or all the policy

18

arguments of today that anything occurred that would not

19

make this a dimished reservation.
We would ask after 61 years the Eigth Circuit

20
21

reversed that we go back to the clear understanding cf

22

all in

1908 in dimishing the reservation and leaving it tc

the Court*
This Court has decided four cases since 1962

that deal generally with the question presented,

8

Seymour, Mattz, DeCoteau and Rosebud.

9

central issue of congressional intent we have an Act of

In terms of the

10

Congress that on its face is to sell and dispose of a

11

portion of an Indian reservation leaving a reservation

12

thus iimished and triggering provisions in the enabling

13

act that talked in terms of reservation extinguishment

14

and a restoration to the public domain which also

15

appears on the fact of the Act.

i

16

In the consultations between the tribe and the

17

federal government references were made to new

18

reservation boundaries and the transaction was generally

19

referred to as a cession or sale of land or a

20

relinquishment of a portion of a reservation as similar

21

transactions were referred to and similar negotiations

22

for decades passed.

23

understanding would lead one to conclude that Congress

24

intended to alter that reservation, and from 1911 until

25

1973 the decisions of our courts have reflected that

We submit that common sense

15

1

common sense understanding.

2

Now in terms of county government we did have

3

a serious problem when the Court of Appeals altered the

4

status quo and disregarded this precedent in 1973.

5

Chief Justice Dunn described the jurisdictional

6

confusion that resulted, and in terms of the units of

7

local government most directly affected by a decision

8

such as that difficulty was experienced in the area in

9

terms of administering law and order and performing

10

other ordinary county functions.
In general I think, the amicus briefs from

11

12

other counties and other parts of the country attest

13

that they have experienced similar problems in recent

14

years.

15

the 1908 Act, fits squarely within the historical

16

perspective of the DeCcteau and Rosebud precedent of

17

this Court from two perspectives.

We feel that essentially this particular Act,

Number one, those cases should establish a

18
19

perspective from the late 1800’s through the 1900’s with

20

respect to the General Allotment Act, specifically

21

Section 5.

22

establish a perspective that although there were changes

23

in that period in time that those changes were not

24

intended to reflect a change in the intent cf Congress.

25

Secondly, DeCoteau and Rosebud also should

I think, to put the second point in another way

16

1

one cannot expect an act in 1894 to be drafted in the

2

same manner to reflect circumstances that did not exist

3

in 1908.

4

tribe has taken in this particular case that you must

5

look to the 1984 Rosebud Act and never go beyond it to

6

1907 and 1910.

Yet, that is essentially the position that the

Yet we are talking about a 1908 act of

7

8

Congress that is in all substantial respects identical

9

to the two later Rosebud Acts.

Secondly, we believe

10

that there is certainly nothing in the DeCoteau or

11

Rosebud documents or the opinions of this Court to

12

reflect that those decisions were intended to be

13

anything other than to reflect a national policy, and

14

the Attorney General's brief filed by the State of

15

Minnesota reflects that concern and 11 other states have

16

joined with Minnesota in those views by lodging letters

17

with the Court.
At the very least DeCoteau and Rosebud

18
19

represent the rule rather than the exception for South

20

Dakota, and the confusion in this particular case

21

started with the pre-Rosebud, pre-DeCoteau precedent of

22

Condon

23

time and this is the case to make clear that such

24

pre-DeCoteau, pre-Rosebud precedent can no longer be

blindly adhered to.

When the Court of Appeals decided Condon it

1

2

did so with express references to stressing the need to

3

find a reservation boundaries on the face of the Act

under what it termed the glare of Seymour.

5

in DeCoteau reversed the Court of Appeals for such

6

strict construction of statutory principles.

This Court

Subsequent to Rosebud the Court did review the

7
8

case again, but the limit to the analysis and the two

9

opinions that they did does not reveal that they have

10

actually adopted the approach of this Court in

11

DeCote au.

12

13
14

QUESTION*

Of course, Rosebud itself affirmed

the Eigth Circuit.
NR. TOBIN*

That is correct.

Rosebud did

15

affirm the Eigth Circuit, but at the time the Eigth

16

Circuit decided Rosebud it was subsequent to having teen

17

earlier reversed in DeCoteau.

18

pre-DeCoteau, pre-Rosebud precedent such as Condon

19

present in the Rosebud case which we feel froze the

20

Eigth Circuit Court of Appeals in

21

that they were going to take in the Condon decision.

22

Secondly, there was no

1973 to the position

This Court in Puyallup indicated that DeCoteau

23

and Rosebud shed new light upon this issue in general.

24

The two lower district court decisions that by the

25

federal district courts that came out subsequent to

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

these decisions adopted the manner and the approach cf

2

this Court's opinions in Rosebud and DeCoteau and

3

documented them to be the same.

4

Now we feel that this documentation and that

5

is the central issue here should have led the Court of

6

Appeals to the same conclusion.

7

In conclusion we ask this Court to reaffirm

8

the holdings and the reasonings of DeCoteau and decide

9

this case in the context of these opinions.

10
11

We submit

that the Court of Appeals should be reversed.
I would like to point out in closing that the

12

location of the tribal agency in this particular case

13

was selected in 1955 when under state and local

14

precedent and federal precedent it was acknowledged to

15

be off the reservation and that the population

statistics presented in the briefs before this Court

17

similarly reflect that move.

18

20

that particular town, and over the past 20 years 2C00

21

more people now reside in that area.

22

The town itself still consists of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARLINDA LOCKLEAR, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF CF RESPONDENT

8

MS. LOCKLEAR;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
10

At the outset I think it is crucial for this

11

Court's inquiry in this case to examine three points,

12

three statements, and in some cases serious

13

misstatements that have been made by Mr. Meierhenry in

14

his presentation for the State.

15

look at the demographics of this area.

16

of the Cheyenne River Reservation now has 65 percent

17

almost 66 percent of the enrolled members of the

18

Cheyenne River Tribe now residing there.

1

First of all, let's
The open portion

Overall the total population of the open area

20

is roughly one-half Indian.

Now there is absolutely no

21

basis in fact or in the record for the Petitioner's

22

suggestion here that those statistics are a result of a

23

current demographic move on the part of the Cheyenne

24

River people as a result of flooding on the western part

25

of the reservation.

I refer the Court to Professor Hoxie's

1

2

conclu sion which is a part of this record that at the

3

time t he proclamation was issued which opened this area

4

in 190 9 55 percent of the tribal allotees were located

5

in the opened area, and the opened area which is now the

6

sub jec t of this law suit.

7

becaus e one of the variations of the allotment act and

8

the op ening act of Cheyenne Fiver over the general

9

allctm ent scheme was that each member of the tribe was

10

to rec eive their own allotment so that when 55 percent

11

of tri bal allotments were located in the opened area

12

that i s a good indication of what the population of the

13

area w as at the time as well.

That is a significant figure

I would also point out to the Court that the

14
15

Congre ssman from South Dakota who was responsible for

16

the su pport and sponsoring and enactment of the Rosebad

17

Acts w hich the Petitioners find so persuasive here was

explicitly that Eagle Butte is in the center of the

Congressman Burke who later sponsored and was

responsible for the enactment of the very 1907 and 1910

Now that is the view mind you of

That we think is a strong indication that

7

8

Congressman Burke unlike the State now knows the

9

difference between the 1907 and 1910 Rosebud Acts and

10

this very situation.

Now the second inquiry we need to

11

examine are those statutes.
Let's look at the similarities in the language

between the 1907, the 1910 Rosebud statutes and this

statute.

Let’s take Nr. Neierhenry’s hypothetical

He suggested that as a committee they might

16
17

have examined in 1907 its precedent in Rosebud and

18

referred to that in adopting the 1908 Cheyenne River

19

statute.

20

have had before it one year before in 1906 consideration

21

of an Act with precisely the same operative language

22

which applied to the Coleville reservation in the State

23

of Washington.

That very same hypothetical committee would

This Court had occasion to construe that
language in Seymore v. Superintendent and did not find

that language the language authorizing the Secretary of

2

the Interior to sell and dispose of surplus and

3

unalloted lands to have the purpose of

disestablishment.

5

prove the clear intent on Congress* part which is

6

required to find an act of disestablishment.

7

We must look elsewhere in Rosebud.

Obviously the language itself dees no

In Rosebud

8

that other evidence is found before the 1907 statute.

9

It is found in he 1904 Act and it is found in the 1901

10

and 1903 agreements, cession agreements, using typical

11

cession language between the Rosebud tribe and the

12

United

States.
Those two agreements were explicitly set out

14

in their very terms in the

17

the 1904 statute were crucial to its inquiry in that

18

case.

19

agreements and the codification of that purpose in the

20

1904 Act establish a base line purpose and a continuing

21

purpose of disestablishment which was simply carried

22

forward in the later 1907 and 1910 Acts.

The preexisting disestablishment language

The fact then that the 1907 and

1910 Acts used

24

language different from the 1904 Act was really viewed

25

as fairly insignificant by this Court in its Rosebud

in this case the sell and dispose language which we find

Heierhenry's hypothetical committee to mean the same

That is a

15

A third point that is significant and where we

16

take sharp difference with the State on is the so-called

17

history of uncontested jurisdiction of the state court

18

over the opened area.

19

State asserts without any reference to any authority

20

because there is none that it has exercised jurisdiction

21

over the opened areas for 60 years without contest by

22

the tribe and the federal government.

23

Now let's examine that.

That is simply not true.

The

The most salient

24

evidence of the untruthfulness of that fact is that

25

there is no a single state prosecution of an Indian in

If you refer

10

to cur brief we cite two instances where the federal

court did prosecute members of the tribe for crimes that

occurred on the opened portion of the reservation after

are prosecutions of a non-Indian, and this Court is well

aware that when there is a competing claim of authority

24

state and the federal government that where non-Indians

QUESTION:

Why does that not waive all

antecedent jurisdictional defects?
MS. LOCKLEAR:

Your Honor, at the time that

the plea was entered and at the time this petition for

10

writ of habeus corpus was filed our client was

11

unrepresented by counsel.

12

with the Eigth Circuit Court of Appeals that counsel was

13

appointed to represent Mr. Eartlett.

14

It was not until the case

It is not at all clear how and under what

15

circum stances plea bargaining was arranged so I cannot

16

speak factually to the issue of waiver, but I would

17

point out as well that jurisdictional defects have

18

traditionally been viewed as nonwaivable by the courts.

19

I think that that is what we are talking about here.

20

are talking about a disabling defect in the state court

21

jurisdiction which could not be waived under any

22

circumstances.

23

We

Now once those three points are examined ycu

24

get some idea of what the State’s case is like here.

25

The State’s case is built on assertions for which there

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

is no evidence to support them in the record and built

2

on mischaracterizations of exactly what happened in the

3

instance of the 1908 statute on Cheyenne River.

4

With he remainder of my time I would like to

5

divide my comments between the two general principles

6

which we think most clearly demonstrate that aside from

7

these mischaracterizations the 1908 Act itself did not

8

have the purpose of disestablishing the opened area of

9

the Cheyenne River Reservation.

10

First, the federal Indian policy which

11

prevailed at the time in 1908 was based on the General

12

Allotment Act also known as the Dawes Act of 1887.

13

Court construed that statute in its decision in

14

Mattz v. Arnett .

15

This

1973 in

As explained by this Court the Dawes Act

16

simply provided for the division of tribal lands among

17

tribal members as an allotment and the sale of surplus

18

or leftover tribal lands to non-Indian homesteaders.

19

was thought at the time this Court explained that by

20

dividing tribal property in that manner the Congress

21

could encourage tribal Indians to abandon tribal ways

22

and adopt White ways.

23

It

It was thought that eventually that process

24

would lead to the natural demise of all Indian

25

reservations, but significantly this Court held in *attz

1

v.

Arnett that the General Allotment Act itself did not

2

have that purpose.

3

provide for or require and was not inconsistent with

4

continued reservation status of all Indian

5

reserv ations.

The General Allotment Act did not

6

QUESTIONj

Do you think that was correct?

7

MS. LOCKLEARs

Yes, Your Honor.

We think that

8

was absolutely correct, and we think that that theme was

9

also carried forward as this Court observed in Kattz v.

10

Arnett in the special opening acts.

11

itself was discretionary and did not compel that any

12

particular Indian reservation be opened.

13

The Dawes Act

Congress from time to time as a result passed

14

special opening acts which required that a particular

15

reservation be opened pursuant to that general policy

16

and oftentimes made some variations for that general

17

policy in light of the particular circumstances of that

18

reserv ation.

19

In its Mattz opinion the Court construed such

20

a general opening act.

21

was the 1892 Clamoth River Act which applied to the

22

Clamoth River Reservation in California.

23

The Act before it in that case

It also had the same language that the

24

hypothetical committee in 1906 had before it in the

25

Coleville statute,

that is, the operative language

28

AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

directed the Secretary of the Interior to sell and

2

dispose of surplus unallotted lands on the reservation.

3

This Court described that statute as simply one of a

4

number of typical opening acts which did not differ

5

materially from the purpose and the effect of the Dawes

6

Act and did not have the effect of altering the

7

reservation boundaries in that case.
This Court in the Mattz opinion in construing

8
9

that statute also referred to the 1908 Cheyenne Fiver

10

Act that is at issue in this case.

In footnote 19 of

11

its opinion the Court after having described the Clamoth

12

River statute as but typical of the numerous opening

13

statutes of the period listed a number of other

14

sta tut es.
That list included among others the 1908

15
16

Cheyenne River Act.

The Court also noted the Cheyenne

17

River statute had been construed by the Eigth Circuit as

18

not having affected reservation boundaries.
This Court's supposition in Mattz v. Arnett

19
20

that the 1908 statute did not have the effect of

21

altering the reservation boundaries is borne cut by a

22

closer examination of the terms of the 1908 statute

23

itself.

24

more than what the Dawes Act authorized generally across

25

the nation.

First of all, the statute generally did not

1

Petitioners have taken the Act did not employ the

2

cession language which has typically been found by this

3

Court to support a finding of disestablishment.

4

primary terms of the 1908 statute then show nothing more

5

than the typical opening act which this Court construed

in both Mattz v. Arnett and Seymour v.

having left the reservation boundaries intact.

The

Superintendent as

Now the State as a result of that seizes upon

8
9

language which appears elsewhere in the statute and

10

tries to construct in effect a new statute based on

11

phraseology and provisos which appear in later

12

provisions of the statute.

13

State refers to is the language where in Section 2 the

14

final

15

allotments retained in the opened portion of the

16

reservation with those allotments located on that part

17

of the reservation "thus dimished".

proviso of Section 2 Congress contrasted Indian

That is the language that the State lifts out

18
19

of the closing proviso out cf Section 2 as the key to

20

construing the entire statute.

21

however, the State is simply wrong.

Even in that instance,

There is no evidence on the basis of the

22
23

record

that we have that Congress intended by the use of

24

that term to mean anything other than reduced or

25

dimished common tribal land ownership, not reduced

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

reservation boundaries.

The Eigth Circuit in its

2

opinion and which this Court cited favorably in Mattz v.

3

Arnett distinctly noted that the context of that phrase

4

"thus diminished” suggests that that is exactly what the

5

phrase meant and no more.
In addition, the legislative history of the

6
7

statute which is set out at length by the State in the

8

appendix to their brief indicates that the Congress in
its reports on the 1908 statute used that phrase

10

"diminished" to refer as well to the reduced or

11

diminished common land base of the tribe, not

12

jurisdiction.
In addition, I would refer the Court to the

13
14

subsequent treatment of the 1908 statute which indicates

15

that that phrase was commonly used by the Department of

10

the Interior in its records after the passage of the Act

17

to refer to precisely that, the area of the reservation

18

whre the tribe held diminished or reduced tribal lands.

1

Specifically and I think which is the most telling

20

example comes from an exhibit which appears as attached

21

and the Department that the 1908 Act did not have the

2

effect of altering the reservation boundaries.
As a result the thus diminished language

3
4

referred to and relied on so heavily by the State in

5

this case can mean no more than what this Court quoted

6

in its Mattz v. Arnett opinion out of the Clamoth River

7

situation.

8

that the statute itself referred to "was the Clamoth

9

River Indian Reservation".

In the Clamoth Fiver Act the Court noted

Now because that phrase in that statute could

10
11

be read either one of two ways this Court concluded that

12

that phrase could not support a finding of clear intent

13

on Congress's part to disestablish the reservation.

14

phrase

15

similarly construed.

The

"thus diminished" in this context must be

16

It as well cannot support a finding of clear

17

intent to disestablish the Cheyenne River Reservation.

18

Now there are as the State has noted surrounding

19

circum stances that must also be examined to construe any

20

particular opening statute.

21

In this instance there are two such

22

surrounding circumstances which we think are

23

particularly telling.

24

agreement, a cession agreement, with the Cheyenne River

26

Sioux Tribe.

First, is the absence of an

)

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

There were as the State points out some

1
2

meetings between a government official and the Cheyenne

3

Tribe for the purpose of explaining the provisions of

4

the 1908 statute.

5

or no negotiation sponsored with the governing body of

6

the Cheyenne River Tribe.

There vas, however, no meeting held

No agreement was proposed.

7

No agreement was

8

signed .

You had nothing more than a small group of

9

tribal members who could be assembled on short notice

10

attending a hurried meeting with a government official

11

for the limited purpose of explaining the Act.
Now let's pause for a moment here and examine

12
13

what the State characterizes as the nature of those

14

discussions.

15

discussions clearly demonstrated to the tribe that their

16

reservation boundaries would be diminished, altered,

17

reduced.

The State would have us believe that those

That is not the case at all.

18

Those discussions demonstrated only that the

19

tribe's common land base would be diminished, reduced.

20

First of all, the magic blue line which the Petitioners

21

find so important as to that construction of the meeting

22

did not take place at all at Cheyenne River.

23

The blue line and the map on which it was

24

drawn appeared only at the meeting that took place

25

several days before with the Standing Rock Tribe.

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Howvec , even if you examine the significance of that

2

blue line and of the map that was produced at that

3

meeting you will see that they do not again even in that

4

context support the construction that the Petitioners

5

would have this Court reach.
We must understand that what we have here is a

6

7

government agent explaining in a the DeCoteau, a

8

language to which the concept of a lands sale is wholly

9

alien — You have a government explaining in that

10

language the provision of exactly that, a land sale.

11

Now to illustrate to the tribe exactly which lands were

12

going to be sold, which lands were going to be retained ,

13

the government agent took out a map and he drew a line

14

and he said these lands will be yours and these lands

15

will be open to settlement.
There is no indication that the government

16
17

agent did more than that, that the government agent

18

meant more than that or that the Standing Bock or the

19

Cheyenne River people in attendance understood any more

20

than that.

21

government agent to diminished land means the same thing

22

that that phrase means in the proviso that appears in

23

Section 2 of the Act.

24
25

Viewed in that context the reference by that

It means nothing more than this will be from
henceforth your reduced land base.

There was no

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1
2

discussion at all of jurisdictional consequences.
Understood in that context the blue line, the

3

map, the appearance of a particular government agent has

4

no significance at all.

5

particular government agent which the Court is

6

encouraged to find persuasive here is really an

7

incidental if relevant factor at all.

8

Now I might add that the

The particular government agent as we pointed
out in our brief had been an agent for some number of

10

years and had traveled in that capacity to a number cf

11

Indian reservations including those in South Dakota.

12

That same agent also visited the Coleville Reservation

13

in Washington which this Court found not to have been

14

disest ablished.

15

There is absolutely no evidence that Congress

16

gave this particular inspector carte blanche to carry

17

with him the kiss of disestablishment to every

18

reservation that he visited.

1

respect is not unique any more than South Dakota is not

20

unique in repsect cf the opening language or with

21

respect to the disestablishment language.

22

South Dakota in that

Those factors will not support finding of

23

disestablishment here.

They were referred to again by

24

this Court in Rosebud, but only up against the context

25

of the clear language cf disestablishment found earlier

Your Honor, we think that the

11

Eigth Circuit has considered that view, reconsidered the

12

view in light of the dissent, your dissent in

13

particular, and in light of this Court's later opinions

14

on this very issue and decided to adhere to its original

position that the Cheyenne River Reservation was net

disestablished by the 1908 Act.

MS. LOCKLEAR*

Yes, Your Honor.

That is true,

20

but we nonetheless think that the Court's majority

21

opinion in its reconsideration en banc of that issue

gives Your Honor sufficient grounds to find that the

1908 statute is different and is not governed by the

MS. LOCKLEAR;

Yes, Your Honor.

That is true.

11

The second circumstance that we think is

12

relevant here and would support a determination by this

13

Court that the opened lands have not been disestablished

14

has already been alluded to, and that is the consistent

15

and unrefuted assertion of tribal authority in this area

16

after 1908.

17

question that concerns tribal Indians themselves.

Essentially what we have got here is a

We have an assertion in this very case of

18
19

state authority to prosecute for crimes that occurred

20

with in a reservation an Indian where the complaining

21

witness in the case is also an Indian.

22

interest in such cases has been acknowledged by this

23

Court to be minimal admittedly.
If we succeed in this litigation then the

now.

It will lose only its ability to prosecute cases

2

such as these.
On the other hand, if we lose this case the

3
4

tribal court will lose the authority it has been

5

exercising since well before 1908 and the authority

6

which has gone unchallenged by the State until the early

7

196C’s to exercise its own jurisdiction in this area.
QUESTIONi

9

Ms. Locklear, can I ask you one

question before your time runs out.

At the very outset

10

of your argument you referred to a letter by Congressman

11

— later Head of the Indian Affairs — Eurke I believe

12

it was about the location of the Indian office in which

13

he said that would be within the reservation, something

14

to that effect.

15

MS. LOCKLEAR;

16

QUESTION:

17

Yes.

Can you tell us where that is in

the record?
MS. LOCKLEAR:

18

Yes.

It is cited in the Hoxie

It appears at page 95 of the Hoxie report

20

itself and it is also cited in our brief at pages 35 and
