ORAL ARGUMENT CF MITCHELL D. FRANKS, ESQ.,
ON EEHALF CF THE APPELLANTS

5

MR. FRANKS:

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This 1983 due process case arose out of the

8
9

Mr. Franks, I think you

firing of an employee of the Florida Highway Patrol in

10

1977.

Although the district court ultimately held that

11

the law regarding pre-termination due process was net

12

clearly established at the time of the firing, it

13

nevertheless continued on and ruled that the Florida

14

statute, Chapter 110, was unconstitutional in that it

15

violated post-termination due process.
It also continued on and found that the

16
17

employee was entitled to damages under 1983 not for any

18

violation of clearly established constitutional law, but

19

because the defendants did not follow a departmental

20

regulation recently enacted in terminating this employee.
QUESTION:

21
22

interpret what the holding of the district court is now?

23

ME. FRANKS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Mr. Franks, would you help us

second

There are —
It -- it seems to have held -- the

district court opinion seemed to hold a new
3

1

statute unconstitutional; and you agree that that much

2

of the holding is in error, and I guess the other side

3

does,

too.

4

MR. FRANKS;

5

QUESTION;

Yes, Justice O'Connor.
Was anything left of its original

6

finding that the older statute was unconstitutional

7

because of the failure to provide a prompt

8

post-termination hearing?

9

MR. FRANKS;

No, Justice O'Connor.

The older

10

statute was enacted previously, was in

11

law, and by the amendment in 1981 that statute was

12

vitiated and is no longer part of this case.

13

QUESTION;

1977, general

Well, and you think there was

14

nothing left of the original district court holding in

15

that regard?

MR. FRANKS:

on the new statute —

MR. FRANKS:

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.
And so all we have is the holding

That is —
And — and a finding that the

21

employers failed to follow their own regulation

22

requiring a speedy investigation, is that right?

23

MR. FRANKS;

I — I don't know that I would

24

call it a speedy investigation.

This Court has jurisdiction over that issue and

Which is cutstanding.
Which is still outstanding, yes,

sir.
So we feel that the Court has the jurisdiction

18

and ca n proceed on to address the issue that is

19

remain ing, and as we see it is the good faith immunity

20

of the governmental officials and their action in

21

t ermin ating this insubordinate personnel.

22

The facts are somewhat convoluted, but

23

essent ially the employee Scherer requested permission to

24

work a second job with the Escambia County Sheriff's

25

Depart ment in Florida.

That permission was erroneously
6

1

granted when a letter that the captain had instructed

2

his secretary not to mail was mailed.

3

immediately went out and bought a handgun and a uniform

4

and proceeded wcrk.

The employee

A couple of weeks later the captain found that

5
6

the employee was working, went back, found out that the

7

letter had been inadvertently mailed; and he was

8

instructed, both orally and in writing, to cease his

9

second

10

job because there was a potential for a

conflict.
He was a radio teletype operator, not a

11
12

trooper.

There were only six radio teletype operators

13

in that particular troop in Pensacola, and they worked

14

around the clock.

15

the Highway Patrol were the beneficiaries of a

16

collective bargaining agreement with the Police

17

Benevolent Association by which troopers could work

jobs, and their employers, the Highway Patrol,
No such benefit

But in any event, he continued his second job,

22
23

the sergeant found cut about it and advised him that he

24

was in violation of the captain's orders to cease his

25

second

job.

And the record is clear that there were
7

1

numerous conferences on this point and that he refused

2

to terminate his second job.

3

He was stating I don't see any reason for a

4

conflict, not that one did or did not exist — that's

5

not the point -- but whether he didn't see one.

His lieutenant --

Mr. Franks, are you taking the

position there was no violation of a constitutional

You didn't raise that question in

MR. FRANKS;

Well, we -- we submit that, Your

18

Honor, that it comes part and parcel with the good faith

19

-- qualified good faith immunity that is addressed in

20

our jurisdictional brief; that the court found that the

21

law regarding the pre-termination of due process was not

22

clearly established at the time.

23

QUESTION:

Well, but you're arguing that even

24

as of today’s law there was no violation, as I

25

understand it.

QUESTION:

In other words, you'd win even if

Weisbrod had been decided before this all happened.

MR. FRANKS:

25

Yes, sir.
Well,

what's your view as to the
10

correctness of the Weisbrod decision under this Court's

preced ents?
MR. FRANKS:

Well, we believe that the -- it

adopts or looks to Arnett v. Johnson as -- as the

5

guidance for the type cf hearing.

6

must be required.

rather that the individual be notified, be put on notice.

10

There is no requirement that you have

Weisbrcd is a correct statement of —
MR. FRANKS:

11

Yes, sir.

We lived with that,

12

and we think that's the — the correct statement.

Put

13

those aren't the facts that were — that are attendant

14

here.
The court went on, as I indicated, and they

15
16

found

that the state had adopted a general regulation

17

which stated that there must be a thorough

18

investigation.

19

is a paramilitary organization, and the facts reflect

20

that there was a thorough investigation made of this,

21

incident, and that it was reported up through the

22

channels.

23

his captain was to Tallahassee where the Appellants,

24

Colonel Beach and Mr. Cavis, referred the matter to the

25

legal office and the personnel office and were advised

This is a — the Florida Highway Patrol

It went from Pensacola to Panama City where

11

1

that the matter was — was proper and proceeded to

2

terminate this insubordinate personnel.

3

And the court found in analyzing

1983 that

4

because the state,

5

state, had promulgated a regulation, that that was a

6

sufficient basis under 1983 to award damages for a

7

violation which — of — of state law and state

8

regulation and not of any clearly established

9

constitutional right.

10

cr in this case an agency of the

Now, the court originally found that there was

11

a right that was there, but they retreated from that in

12

a subsequent opinion in June of 1982 which was announced

13

a couple of weeks before the Harlow.

14

district court did net have the wisdom of this Court in

15

the Harlow decision, but -- and Harlow did away with the

16

subjective prong and locked to was the violation of the

17

law clearly established, and was it clearly established

19

to the decision of Frocunier v. Navarette, and there was

20

an allegation in that case that prison officials had

21

violated clearly established state law and regulations

22

regarding the prison mailing regulations.

23

specifically rejected that as a finding and found that

24

the law had to be one that was clearly established and

25

was under the Constitution.

So admittedly, the

QUESTION:

Mr. Franks, do you think the

2

district court used the violation of state regulations

3

by the state official as an element of the violaticn of

4

constitutional rights finding, or simply as a denial of

5

good faith immunity?

6

MR. FRANKS:

I think that he looked at it

established at the time; and, two, he found that there

He found

12

stated that because there was a clearly established

-- this abrogated their shield of good faith immunity,

15

and for that reason he would be subject to damages, not

16

for the violaticn --

QUESTION:

So he then looked to the

Well,

then, what is left to base

the damage award on?
MR. FRANKS:

We would argue — urge that there

20

is nothing to base the damage on under the law that was

21

announced in Harlow, and I see no need to retreat from -

QUESTION:

What -- what did the settlement

agreement that the Appellee entered into say?
MR. FRANKS:

The settlement agreement was

reached in his state career service proceeding whereby
14

he was challenging the termination, and he was ordered

between full back pay and partial back pay was the

No.

to reserve and turn ever to the United States the

11

argument that we consider today.

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. WILKINS, ESQ.,

14

AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. WILKINS:

15
16

please

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the Court:
In defining the ccntcurs of the concept of

17
18

qualified official immunity, this Court has attempted to

19

balance two important but competing interests: the right

20

of the individual to a remedy for a constitutional wrong

21

against the necessity of protecting public officials

22

from the hazards of litigation so as to prevent undue

23

disruption in the conduct of public affairs.
Beginning with the Court’s first case in this

24
25

area,

in Pierson v. Ray, and continuing through its
15

1

decision in Butz v. Ecncmou, it accommodated these

2

interests by casting the qualified immunity defense as a

3

wide-ranging inquiry into the subjective and objective

4

good faith of the defendant public official.

5

In Harlow, however, relying on the past

6

experience of the federal courts — that is, in Harlow

7

v. Fitzgerald -- the Court recast the qualified immunity

8

doctrine as a single, strictly legal inquiry that turned

9

on one factor* that is, the Court extended immunity to

10

public officials unless they violated clearly

11

established rights of which a reasonable person would

12

have k nown .

13

The Court left little doubt why it was sc

14

dramatically restructuring the doctrine.

15

because the prior test had rarely resulted in the

16

dismissal of claims prior to actual litigation because

17

it turned on so many evidentiary variables.

18

It did sc

The new test was specifically designed to

19

permit the disposition of immunity claims without the

20

necessity of subjecting all public officials to

21

discovery and trial on that issue.

22

The question — the important question

23

presented here that’s left in this case at this point is

24

whether or not the Court will remain with the position

25

sc recently taken in Harlow, or whether the qualified
16

1

immunity test will once more evolve into a consideration

2

of multiple factors, thereby robbing the test of the

3

ability to settle litigation prior to actual discovery

4

or trial.
In this case, the Appellee entered federal

5
6

district court with a claim that he’d been denied due

7

process.

8

concluded that he was denied nc clearly established due

9

process right -- although I would reply to one of the

Although the district court ultimately

10

questions from the bench I think it’s clear from the

11

decision that he found that under current law the

12

statute would be — would be violated now, or the

13

Constitution had been violated in tha current

14

provisions, although in 1977 when he’d been dismissed it

15

wasn’t clearly established at that point.
He nevertheless or the court nevertheless

16
17

denied the Appellants qualified immunity,

18

by citing what it called the totality cf the

19

circumstances.

20

record, I see that there was a violation of a regulatory

21

provision here that renders their conduct unreasonable.

22

Unreasonable conduct is not eligible for qualified

23

immunity.

It said looking at all the facts in the

That sort of analysis, of course, has some

25

and it did so

force.

Indeed, it was the analysis that prevailed prior
17

1

to Ear lew.

2

Court

3

that i mmunity would no longer depend upon an analysis of

4

the to tality of the circumstances, but rather whether or

5

not th ere was allegation of clearly established rights.

But it was specifically rejected by this

in Harlow, and the Court made clear in that case

6

QUESTION:

Counsel, would it be -- would ycu

7

make t he same argument if the administrative regulation

8

were p erfectly clear, so that you could objectively say

9

we don 't have the problems we have in a subjective

10

a n a ly s is or totality of the facts on summary judgment?

11

HR. WILKINS:

Yes, we would, Justice Stevens,

12

for on e important question -- for one important reason,

13

It tec omes extremely difficult, even when you say the

14

r e g ul a tion is very clear, to keep the analysis from

15

going beyond the narrow bounds set in Harlow.

16

me exp lain why.

And let

It is a little difficult.

What — what the Court did in Harlow was net

17
18

say th at good faith is irrelevant to qualified

19

immuni ty.

20

of mak ing qualified immunity depend upon proof of

21

absclu te good faith, were simply not worth the cost of

22

sub jec ting all public officials to discovery and trial

23

on tha t issue.

24
25

The Court simply concluded that the benefits

Now, the Appellee’s argument here, and the
only a rgument that really can be made in support of the
18

1

approach below, is that a violation of a regulatory cr

2

statutory provision demonstrates the absence of good

3

faith tut does so in a way that doesn't incur the kinds

4

of costs associated with the approach prior to Harlow.

5

And so taking from ycur question, the argument would be

6

well,

7

means of determining the absence of good faith?
We don't think that's so at all for this

8
9

when they're clear, isn't that really a cost-free

reasons when — when a public official violates a

10

clearly established constitutional right, we think that

11

it can be fairly assumed or it can be fairly — that

12

conduct can be fairly described as lacking in good

13

faith.

14

constitutional rule, the public official should be aware

15

and should not transgress it.

16

cannot be said with regarding to the vast majority of

17

regulatory or statutory provisions.

18

clearly established as constitutional provisions once

19

they're announced by this Court.

After all, if it's a clearly described

However, the same thing

They're rarely as

20

Indeed, in this case the Appellants had the

21

advice of counsel before they dismissed the Appellee.

22

The district court looking even at all the conduct in

23

this case said that they acted in ultimate — in -- in

24

good faith.

25

As we describe in our brief, even with clearly
19

1

established sorts of provisions, there are all kinds of

2

reasons why a public official might or might net comply

3

with the provision in a given circumstance.

4

very difficult fer a ccurt to determine after the fact

5

whether or not something really was clearly established

6

in the heat of battle.

The Harlcw problem that's raised by the other

side is they neglect at all to make the distinction

if — even if Harlcw is implicated in this case, this

a public official is performing a discretionary duty,

then if he or she violates clearly established law, then

they're liable in damages.

disretionary/nondiscretionary functions is removed from

Colonel Beach had a
