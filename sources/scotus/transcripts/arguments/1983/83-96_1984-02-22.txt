ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FARRIN*

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
This case involves the Import-Export Clause of
the United States Constitution in Ohio’s ad valorem

10

personal property tax which applies to all goods used in

11

business within Ohio regardless of their origin.

12

case presents two issues tc the Ccurt, loth cf which

13

involve the scope of this Court's 1976 decision in

14

ffichelin Tire Corporation v. Wages.

15

This

The first issue is whether the Ohio Supreme

16

Court properly applied and interpreted this Court's

17

decision in Michelin in its holding that the Tax

18

Commissioner was collaterally estopped by this Court's

19

1945 decision in Hccven £ Allison Company v. Evatt from

20

imposing its ad valorem property tax on Hooven £

21

Allison's imported raw materials which were no longer in

22

transit or retained in their original packages and were

23

held for use in manufacturing in Ohio.

24

Inherent in this issue is whether the criginal

25

package doctrine upon which Hooven was based retains any

subsequent to this Court's decision in Michelin.

QUESTION:

Mr. Farrin, did the Ohio Supreme

4

Court apply state collateral estoppel principles in

5

finding the state precluded ty the Hooven £ Allison

6

decisicn?
MR. FARRIN:

7
8

Justice O'Connor, the state --

the Ohic Supreme Court accepted this Court's limitation
on the doctrine of collateral estoppel enunciated in

1

Commissioner v. Sunnen, but found that that limitation

11

being

12

intervening decision of this Court has changed the legal

13

principles upon which the prior decision was based.
QUESTION:

14
15

that collateral estoppel is inapplicable where an

Well, so you think the Court was

trying to apply federal preclusion principles.
ME. FARRIN:

16

Justice O'Connor, I believe the

17

Court was applying federal law cn the issue.

18

it was required to apply federal law --

MR. FARRIN:

federal common law, is it, cf collateral estoppel that's

2

binding on the states?

3

MR. FARRIN:

Justice Stevens, I believe it's

4

inherent in the basic power cf a court that it must

5

determine the scope cf its own judgment.

6

upon which the Chic Supreme Court based its collateral

7

estopped decision was Eooven £ Allison v.

8

was a decision of this Court which dealt solely with the

9

federal constitutional issue; that is, the immunity

10

provided by the Import-Export Clause of the federal

11

Constitution.

The judgment

Evatt, which

I believe this Court has on at least two

12

13

occasions determined that where collateral estopped is

upon a federal decision that the effect of that

QUESTION:

18
19

And what are those cases you’re

just referring to?
MR. FARRIN:

Those -- those cases -- and I

20

apologize; they were net cited in the brief, because I

21

was not aware of them at the time — are Deposit Pank v.

22

Frankfurt at 1S1 U.S. 499, and Stahl v. Gottlieb, 3C5

23

U.S. at 165.

24
25

I think this principle is consistent with the
restatement of judgments at Section 87 which in effect

carries out the

2
3

QUESTION

Do you mind restating what you say

i

those cases stand for?
MR. FARRIN:

4

Certainly, Mr. Justice Brennan.

5

My position is that those cases state that where a

6

federal judge -- whether a federal judgment has teen

7

given due effect is a decision for this Court to make.

8

It's a federal question and not a question for the state

9

court to decide .
I believe they point cut that it*s a

10
11

fundamental concept that a court must determine the

12

scope and effect of its own judgment.
QUESTION:

13

Well,

I thought -- the way you

14

stated it previously, was it the meaning, what the Court

15

held in the prior cases a federal question, not the —

16

not the — not the effect that must be given it in a

17

state court.
MR. FARRIN:

18

Mr. Justice White, I believe what

19

those cases and what the fundamental principle require

20

is that where a — where collateral estoppel is to he

21

applied based on a decision of this Court, that this

22

Court must determine the scope and effect of that

23

decision.

24

the effect of this Court's decision without review by

25

this Court, we would be left with the result that each

If we’re to allow a state court to determine

of the 50 states might come up with a different

interpretation of this Court —

3

QUESTIONS

Well, that wouldn't depend cn

4

collateral estoppel or anything like that.

5

depend cn -- on — cn ccrrecting a state court's view of

6

what this Court held in the past.
KB. FARRINs

7

That would

Your Honcr, I think that this

Court in order to assure that the state court properly

9

applies an earlier decision of this Court, particularly

10

where there's an intervening decision of this Court —

MR. FARRINs

13

QUESTIONS

Yeah.

All right.

That's a little

different wording of it which I think -MR. FARRINs

16
17

— Is a decision that this Ccurt

must make.

14
15

Right, right.

I apologize if I confused the

issue earlier, Mr. Justice.
QUESTIONS

18

But if the earlier case had been

19

Smith against Jones instead of involving Hooven against

20

Allison, you still might have a question of what effect

do you

decisions which collaterally estop a party based or a

2

decision of this Court, this Court will never be able to

reach the question of whether or not that application of

was proper.

ON BEHALF CF THE PETITIONER — Resumed

MR. FARRINj

The second issue presented in this case is a

8

broader one; that is, whether Chic can impose its

9

nondiscriminatcry ad valorem property tax on imported

10

raw materials which are retained in their original

11

packages, are no longer in transit, and are held for use

12

in manufacturing within the state of Ohio within the

13

strictures of the Import-Export Clause.

The Tax Commissioner has two contentions in

this case.

that Michelin effected a change in the legal principles

limitations enunciated in this Court's decision in

the Tax Commissioner contends

The second contention of the Tax Commissioner

22

is that Kichelin's holding that a nondiscriminatcry ad

23

valorem property tax imposed on imported goods no longer

24

in transit is net an impost or a duty, and therefore is

25

not prohibited by the Import-Export Clause, is

While the Ohio Supreme

it specifically found that this Court's decision in

11

Michelin neither implicitly overruled nor effected a

12

change in the legal principles upon which Kooven was

13

based.

14

QUESTION

Let me make sure I understand what

15

you're saying about the holding of the tax — is it the

16

Tax Commissioner you're referring to or the Supreme

17

Court of Ohio?

18

MB. FARBINs

Justice P.ehnquist,

there were

19

decisions initially by the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals.

20

It's -- it's a -- or it's a review board which hears

21

appeals from determinations of the Tax Commissioner.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. FARRIN:

And it — it ruled how?
It ruled that the Tax

24

Commissioner was estopped from assessing its tax based

25

on this Court's decision in Kooven.

1

QUESTION!

Okay.

So it's the original Hooven

2

decision in the view of the Eoard of Tax Appeals that

3

collaterally estops the Commissioner in this case.

4

MR. FARRINi

Yes, Justice Rehnquist.

And it

5

was also the position cf the Ohio Supreme Court that

6

that was the decision that estopped the Commissioner

7

from issuing the assessment.

8

The facts in this case are rather simple.

9

QUESTION:

10

No one has passed on the

constitutional issue yet?

property the imported raw material retained in the

2

original packages.

3

The Tax Ccmmissicner does not dispute that the

nature of the goods and the nature of the tax at issue

5

in the present case are the same as those involved in

6

the decision in this Court or ly this Court in Hooven £

7

Allison v. Evatt.

8

The Tax Commissioner will first argue that
Michelin effected a change in the legal principles upon

10

which Hccven was based, thereby rendering collateral

11

estoppel inapplicable, and then will argue that the

12

holding in Michelin requires a finding that Ohio's tax

13

is valid under the Import-Export Clause.
QUESTION;

14
15

Of course, in Michelin the Court

overruled Low v. Austin, but it didn't overrule Hccven.
MR. FARRIN;

16

Justice Blackmun, it did not

17

expressly overrule Hooven.

I would submit that it

18

implicitly overruled Hooven, because Hooven was based on

1

the original package doctrine that was formalized by the

20

Court in the Low v. Austin decision.
A review of both decisions reveals that the

21

22

identical portions of Erown v. Maryland and the license

23

cases were relied on by the Court in Low and by the

24

Court in Hccven.

These were the previsions that this

in the Michelin decision specifically found that

QUESTION;

Suppose we agree with you on the

3

collateral estoppel issue.

4

for the Chic court to pass cn the constitutional issue,

5

or should we decide it here?

6

ME. FARRIN;

Should we remand the case

Justice Elackmun, I would sulmit

7

that it would be appropriate to decide the issue here.

8

While this Court's decision on the collateral estoppel

9

issue would resolve the specific issue determined by the

10

court below, I believe this case presents an appropriate

11

vehicle for this Court to dispel any questions with

12

respect to the scope of its decision in Michelin.

13

QUESTION;

Well,

what -- Mr. Attorney General,

14

what would -- what do you suppose your — the state

15

court would have dene if -- if in Michelin we had

16

specifically said that not only Low but Hooven is -- are

17

-- is overruled?

18

MR. FARRIS;

I feel confident that our court,

19

in light of such a decision, would have upheld the

20

imposition of Ohio's tax.

21

QUESTION;

Eut —

Even though — even though it

22

involved the same party that had had a favorable

23

decision below — before.

24
28

MR. FARRIN;

Justice White, I think it's clear

that if this Court had specifically overruled Hooven,
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

that the Chic Supreme Court would not have applied

2

collateral estoppel.

3

QUESTION:

Well, let’s assume that in — let’s

4

assume that in -- let’s assume that in Michelin the

8

Court had said we overrule Lew against Austin, but

6

whether Hooven should be overruled we save for another

day.

Then what?

Then what should your courts have done?

HE. FAEBIN:

Justice White, I believe cur

court should have read the decision in Michelin and

10

in that decision.

13

under this Court’s decision in Sunnen, it clearly

Michelin adopted a fundamentally

QUESTION:

4

MR. FARRIN:

Right.
— But then it also quoted some

6

language from a lower court decision in the Eenfield

case, indicating that it was net within the province of

7

a lower court to guess at what this Court might do.

8
9

I think in light of the nature of this -- this
Court's decision in Michelin that that particular

10

language quoted by the court was in applicable.

11

12

this Court in Michelin so clearly controls this case

there’s a growth in the legal principles that you have

ME. FAERIN;

If the Court specifically stated

that Hccven was not overruled and simply didn’t say that

22

we don't reach the question, I believe that the lower

court

24
25

would properly have applied collateral estoppel.
QUESTION;

Well, collateral estoppel and the

constitutional issue are kind of blended together,

12

has to be determined whether those constitutional issues

have remained unmodified or unchanged.

argue they've -- they've — the constitutional principle

QUESTION:

I — I'm not — I'm sure if

Yes, but that brings up my

question, which I thought you answered, as to whether we
go ahead and decide the constitutional issue.
MR. FARRIN:

Justice Blackmun, I believe if

12

this Court held that Hooven was overruled

13

in effect, decide the constitutional issue, because by

14

overruling Hooven it would have specifically answered

15

the second issue we present: that is, whether Ohio's tax

16

can be constitutionally applied to imported raw

17

Eut the point is, the point is to the extent

8

underdeveloped nations maximize their development and

9

achieve what they can.

10

So to the extent that federal policy is

11

let's lock at what the tax dees and how it

To the extent federal policy is important,

18

20

simply no doubt that the economic reality -- and it's

21

shown in Mr. Bucks* affidavit which is contained as an

22

appendix to the brief of the Respondent -- economic

reality is that the sources from which Hooven S Allison

MR. FARRIN:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

please the Courts
Just a few matters in rebuttal.

The Tax

Commissicner 's position was initially that collateral

10

estoppel did not apply because the controlling legal

11

principle upon which Hocven was based had been

12

repudiated or at least changed by this Court’s decision

3
4

in Michelin.
There was no necessity for the Tax

5

Commissioner to present any factual evidence with

6

respect to that claim.

7

that determination are that the same tax -- the same

8

type of tax was involved — that is, a state

9

nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax -- and that

The only facts necessary for

20

the imported goods upon which that tax was attempted to

2

be imposed were no longer in transit.

22

Michelin specifically held that such attacks

23

on those goods is not an impost or a duty.

If it’s not

24

an impest or a duty, it was not immune, or it was net

25

prohibited by the Import-Export Clause.

The Respondent's attempt to put some burden on

2

the Commissioner to prove its case is,

3

disingenuous attempt to get this Court to ignore the

4

clear ruling of the Mchelin decision.

5

Respondent in this case actually waived its right tc an

6

evidentiary hearing before the Board and chose obviously

7

to rely on its collateral estoppel attack and abandon

8

any attempt to actually prove any constitutional

9

violation by the imposition of a tax in the present case.

The -- the

I would point out with respect to a couple of

11

statements made by the Respondent regarding the notice

12

of appeal and what was raised by the Respondent.

13

indicated in my opening argument, the Respondent did

14

raise in his notice of appeal the Commerce Clause aspect

15

regarding the federal regulation of foreign commerce.

16

That is the only portion of the Commerce Clause that was

17

raised in the notice of appeal as the -- as the decision

18

of the Board of Tax Appeals at page A-17 of the petition

19

for cert appendix reveals.

20

As I

With respect to Justice Rehnguist's question

21

regarding custom-bonded warehouses, I believe that such

22

warehouses would only protect imported goods from the

23

imposition of a state tax if those goods are

24

subsequently re-engaged in foreign commerce; that is,

25

transported out -- out of the state.

If those goods are

Well, under the — under the

Allison in the present case would require ethers within

That is a requirement that Michelin specifically said

was not required by the Import-Export Clause, and I

don’t believe that this Court should allow the
