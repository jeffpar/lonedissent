CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

whenever you are ready, Mr. Hoover.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES R. HOOVER

4

ON BEHAIF OF THE PETITIONER

5
6

I think you may proceed

MR. HOOVER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7

please the Court.

8

to keep in mind exactly what this case is about, because

9

many items in the brief deal with issues that are net

10
11

I believe it is very important for us

really here.
I think Judge Ferguson, in the Court of

12

Appeals in the dissent, very distinctly put it in the

13

beginning of that, that this is, in effect, a case

14

dealing with the subject of a male person who has teen

15

judicially determined to be mentally unable to engage in

16

the practice of law in the State of Arizona, may still

17

maintain a £2,200,000 damage action under the Federal

18

antitrust laws against the Committee on Examination and

19

Admission of the Arizona Eupreme Court for failing to

20

give him a passing grade on the state tar examination.

21

Locking at what the case is about, we are here

22

contending that on at least four principal bases we

23

should prevail, that Is the committee members should not

24

be subject to this kind of action.

25

state action items.

Three of those are

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

The first is that we contend that we are

1

2

involved in state action as the state, as the

3

sovereign.

4

your view, that we are involved in state action as a

5

subdivision of the state.

6

Secondly, failing that particular test in

Thirdly, failing that, that we would be

7

involved in state actions as a private party, although

8

we do concur with the amicus position of the United

9

States that that is not the case here, we are not

10

private parties, although we certainly that they meet

11

those tests — that we meet these tests.

12

Fourthly, that if there is r.c state action

13

involved at all, then the Ncerr-Pennington doctrine

14

would apply insofar as antitrust matters are concerned.

15

The principal basis of the state action doctrine, as an

16

exemption from the antitrust laws, is federalism.

17

I think

something again ought to be kept in

18

mind that taking the case as it is, as a pleadings case,

19

and assuming that the members cf the committee did all

20

of the wrongful things that either the complaint alleges

21

or that the briefs infer, the federal antitrust laws are

22

not the basis upon which to redress this matter.

23

are plenty cf remedies available to Hr. Bcnwin, to

24

anyone in Hr. Bonwin*s position, to in effect have his

25

day in court, to have his merits as a lawyer determined.

There

1

tc have his claim in effect adjudicated.
In fact, we contend he has done just that ty

2

3

virtue of the fact that his admissions, on the very

4

issues that we. are talking about, have previously teen

5

determined by the State of Arizona.

6

these facts were presented tc them, and they hae been

7

brought to this Court, not once, but he has gone tc the

8

State of Arizona on three different occasions and teen

9

turned down, and tc this Ccurt, from these three

10

different occasions, on three different writs of

11

certiorari in addition to this case.

In other words,

So it is not a situation where we are dealing

12
13

with any man’s rights that have not had a fair chance tc

14

be adjudicated.

15

with what very chilling effect on state or state

16

officers, state officials, ycu have by subjecting them

17

to the pressures and the difficulties cf facing a trial

18

on merits and facts for seme underlying purposes or

19

reasons under the antitrust laws.

This is a case where we are dealing

Our view basically is that under Parker versus

20
21

Brown,

22

that this is very much the heart of the case —

23

which to us is the heart of the case, in fact

QUESTIONS

Mr. Hoover, may I ask you,

24

assuming, and I know ycu, of course, deny the

25

allegations in the complaint, but assume that the

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

examiners did net set the exam schedules on the fcasis of

2

competence to practice law, but they wanted to set the

3

figure so low that very few new lawyers would be

4

admitted to protect the existing bar frem the

5

competition of too many lawyers in the community, and

6

the Plaintiff wanted tc challenge that practice, which

7

assume may not well happen.

8

such a

If he wanted to challenge

practice, hew should he do it other than by the

MR. HOOVER*

10

First, Your Honor, we very much

11

appreciate the fact that you recognize we deny having

12

done that.

13

QUESTION*

14

MR. HOOVER*

15

18

But we must assume it’s true.
We must assume it's true for this

case because it is a pleadings case.
QUESTION*

16
17

I

Right, so how does he challenge

it?
MR. HOOVER*

Hew does he do that; exactly the

19

way he did it, and exactly the way that a case, the

20

Met-Ccal case, challenged a state statute in California,

21

that is through some other proceeding in the state

22

courts saying, look, the state should give me a license

23

to practice, and if the method by which I am trying to

24

get there is improper because cf a violation of the

25

antitrust laws, then I ought tc get my license.

That is exactly a n i ssue that h e presented in

1

2

May of

1974 to the Arizona Sup reme Court, and they

3

denied it, and he brought t he case here o n a writ of

4

certiorary, and in doing so , h e took the very same

5

basis -- the very same basi s t hat he cont ended was the

6

basis of the antitrust clai m ■
Although he did n ct present the antitrust

7

8

claim to this Court in Augu st of 1974, he brought these

9

same grounds here in a writ of certiorari and he said --

Do you argue res jud icata ?

MR. HOOVERs

That is an alterna te ground, You r

that has been sugges ted for the fi rst time in

it were returned to the cou r t below.

19

how he could do it, and in fact he did.

22

issues in a system of feder alism.

of a preset standard and fa ilure to grade petitioner on

24

his own legal abilities, un related to those cf the

25

particular group taking the exam at the same time as

this case, but

He said that the lack

2

equal protection tc Petitioner in violation of the

3

Fourteenth Amendment.
That is in August of 1974 on a writ of

certiorari to this Court, which was denied.

That is the

6

way to raise the issue, it is to come here and say,

lock,

I wasn’t fairly graded.
QUESTION;

Suppose that on his very first

9

go-round, when he went tc the Arizona Supreme Court, he

Suppose we had granted that petition for

21

certiorari on a claim like that, what would your -- your

22

argument then here would be not procedure, but it would

23

be that this is state action.

25

ME. HOOVER;

No, my argument would be

different, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

You would also say, though, that

15

the antitrust laws have nothing to do with it because we

16

were acting as an agency of the state.

17

MR. HOOVER;

In the instance of what you are

18

talking about, we would contend that we were an agency

19

of the state absolutely.

20

that’s a very different kind of situation because he —

21

QUESTION;

But, in terms of this case,

Actually, since the Arizona Sue reme

22

Court would have been turning him down, that is state

23

action, I suppose.

24
25

MR. HOOVER;

That is cur position because they

are the people who make the decisions as to whether

1

someone is admitted or someone is not admitted, and here

2

we are talking about something that is against the

3

individual members of a committee appointed by the state

4

court.as state officers, and as a damage action itself.
Ke draw a very strong distinction — excuse

5

6

me, we draw a very strong parallelism between Parker

7

versus Erown and this case.

8

state legislature enacted an act, and the governor

In the Parker case, the

appointed a commission.
In this situation, the commission then had a

10
11

nomination of a committee, and those - and had

12

nominations made tc it by, in effect, the people

13

affected, the raisin growers.

14

the. committee selected a ccmm'ission — excuse me,

15

selected a committee, which then made a recommendation

16

to the commission.

From these nominations,

We have a very similar situation here, only

17
18

it*s a higher level item, the Supreme Court, from a list

1

of nominees from the state tar, selects a committee that

20

makes a recommendation to the committee.

21

we are dealing with a closer tc the ultimate seat cf the

22

government of the state than even Parker versus Brown

23

was, and we are dealing with something that is

24

statewide.

25

state acting through the only way the state can act and

In our view,

We are dealing with something that is the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that is through various bodies and commissions.
The state cannot be limited to act as a

2
3

sovereign simply by the legislature or the supreme

4

courts although that’s clear that that is acting a

5

sovereign, that is not the only the state should act.
QUESTION!

6

Mr. Hoover, do the bar examiner

7

screen on the basis of anything except legal

8

compet ence ?
HR. HOCVEPi

9

Yes, Your Honor.

The bar

10

examiners screen on the basis of several items in the

11

rule.

12

age.

13

at the time, you must be a citizen of the United

14

States .

For example, someone must be over 21 years of
Under the rules, as we contend they were involved

his brief are applicable, you had to be a resident of

2

case.
QUESTIONS

3
4

Tc you have an interview like seme

states do for ethics or moral qualifications?
MR. HOOVFRs

5

He dc have interviews and

6

hearings if something comes up in the course of the

7

examination of the materials that are presented that

8

leave us with pause or concern.
QUESTION:

9
10

But you don't have an automatic

interview?
MR. HOOVER:

11

It is net automatic, but it is --

12

it does occur when someone is in a situation that they

13

are going tc be denied cn that basis.

14

going tc be passed on that basis, they are not

15

int erviewed.

But when they are

QUESTION:

Eut of course —

17

QUESTIONi

Excuse me, go ahead.

18

QUESTION:

If — I gather legal competence is

19

determined cn the basis of a written examination, is

20

it?

21

MR. HOOVER:

22

QUESTIO?!:

That is correct.
If the applicant passes that, he

23

may nevertheless be denied admission cn one of these

24

other factors?

25

MR. HOOVER:

Yes.

QUESTIONj

1
2

Age is simple, of course, he is or

isn't over 21, but what about the mental one?
ME. HCOV-EE;

3

That is exactly Mr. Eonwin's

4

situation, in fact, because he has subsequently taken

5

the Arizona Bar examination cn two other occasions, and

6

ultimately on the third one he did pass the

7

examination.

8

fitness category after hearings in front of a master,

9

who happened to be a judge, a Superior Court Judge,

10

He has been denied admission on the mental

appointed by the court.
The court said:

11

.Re take this matter to

12

ourselyes, take it out of the hands of the committees,

13

and we will decide it.

from that particular decision cf the Arizona Supreme

15

Court,

16

17

That issue has been decided, and

a writ of certiorari has also been sought and
r>

QUESTIONi

Of course, as Justice Stevens asked

18

you, though, we assume that he has been denied because

19

-- it is a pleading stage because he wasn't admitted

20

when he took bar becaus you had a quota.

21

22
23

MR. HOOVER:

That is correct.

For the

purposes of case, that is correct.
QUESTION:

It is as though he had been denied

24

admission because you only wanted, let's just take, for

25

instance, 100 lawyers instead cf 200 lawyers being

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

admitted each year, and he happened tc he the 101st cn

2

the list.

3

it?
MR. HOOVER;

4
5

That's correct, that's the status

of the pleadings as we see it.
QUESTIONi

6
7

That is the way we judge this case, isn’t

Just one other question following

on what Justice Brennan asked.

8

MR. HOOVERi

9

QUESTIONt

Certainly.
Is it part of the state policy that

10

the Arizona Supreme Court and these various people

11

administer to limit the number cf lawyers for economic

12

rea son s?

13
14
15

MR. HOOVER;

That's not within the record, and

as a matter of fact, that is net the case.
QUESTION;

If it is not the state policy, then

16

how can you contend that the policy he describes is

17

mandated by the state?

18

MR. HOCVFP;

That is the impact cf the policy

19

no matter hew much -- If you exclude one person, and any

20

time you deal with qualifications there is a very

21

substantial view that you will —

22

QUESTION;

No, but therer is a very great

23

difference between excluding electricians, because you

24

don't want ten new ones this year, and saying, we won't

25

let any in unless he knows the difference between

1

getting a shock and not getting a shock.
HR. HOOVER:

2

I understand, Your Honor, bet my

3

point is this.

Taking the pleadings as they are in this

4

situation, the point that we contend is state action,

5

when dene by the state, is that you only need to have a

6

clearly articulated state policy.

7

That is that the state policy is one which

8

displaces competition with a form of regulation, and

9

when you do that, by definition when you exclude

10

somebody, you will have an anti-competitive effect if

11

these people going to the marketplace have a competitive

12

effect.

13

particular pleading.

14

by the fact that we are doing something that says, here

15

we make a determination and we made a decision.

16

We have to assume that for the status of this
Therefore, the state action comes

This is why I emphasized the point earlier

17

that if we were wrong in that, there are other ways for

18

him to have redress, and that you should not put a very

19

chilling effect on state officers in trying to decide

20

these issues by saying, fine, you are going to be

21

subject to very substantial triple damages to be for,

22

apparently, personally.

23

In other words, there is an excellent article

24

written by Professor Areeda in 95 Harvard law Review,

25

435, which I commend to you, and we cite it in cur

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

brief.

I think he very clearly points that out when

2

dealing with the subdivision of the state point, the

3

same thing that we are discussing here, and that is that

4

once you start looking behind the authorizations, once

5

you start looking at what might be motives even, because

6

this is apparently what this would lead to, and

7

certainly the court and the law in that case rejected

8

the idea that you look at the motives of the people

9

functioning here.
When you start doing that, you put the state

10
11

officer in the position of saying. Gee, I had better be

12

very careful that I don't tread on somebody, because if

13

I dc and he is displeased, I'm going to have to face

14

being sued in a triple damage action.

HR. BOOVEPt

Before.
Boulder was then only decided by

21

the Tenth Circuit, and before you decided it, although I

22

contend that Boulder stands for the proposition that

23

home rule is a neutrality in effect, a passiveness upon

24

the state.

25

and, therefore, Boulder really doesn't have anything to

It's net state action, it's state passivity,

Why wouldn’t it he passivity if the

authority to do anything you want to or very broad

I think that’s not —
Ycu could go any way of several

I dent’ think that’s passivity.

In other words, in

New it's for the court to decide just

I want to point out that first there's a

question of what test should apply, and I had urged

15

Met-Cal in the brief, which has got the two prongs, the

16

clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed prong,

17

and the supervision prong.
I wish to point out that the petitioners have

18
19

relied heavily on being state agents and state

20

officials.

21

Golfarb, being an agency for limited purposes doesn't

22

create an antitrust shield when they use their powers

23

for anti-competitive benefit of their members,

24

likewise, in City of Lafayette, Met-Cal, and I think in

Boulder, too, the court has said that being a state

unconstitutional, because I think you did in effect was

that the reason you have the state action exemption is

in the interest of federalism.

CN

REHALF OF THE AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MR. WALLACE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
10

Whether the complaint in this case should have

11

survived the motion to dismiss is the procedurally

12

narrow question before the court, but in the view of the

13

United States a somewhat broader perspective than the

14

immediately presented context cf bar examinations helps

15

to illuminate the proper resolution of that question.

16

It'is not uncommon for the states to have

17

dozens of boards or commissions with authority to

18

license or to regulate particular trades or professions,

1

and these boards are often comprised, as in this case,

20

exclusively or predominantly of individuals who are

21

themselves engaged in the trade being regulated.

22

Some of these boards pose dangers of the

23

imposition of guild type restrictions on competition

24

that quite frankly are of considerably more significance

25

to cur competitive economy than the question whether an

37

In recent years, the enforcement activities of

5

the United States in this area have focused primarily on

6

rules adopted by these boards prohibiting competitive

7

8

restricting methods of solicitation of business.

We gave one hypothetical example in cur trief

2

of a beard to determine whether restaurants meet health

3

and sanitation requirements, and the possibility that it

4

might for anti-competitive reasons refuse to license a

5

restaurant even though it had no basis for thinking that

6

there was any health or sanitation problem.
Another example might be hypothesized from the

7
8

face of the Maryland statutes dealing with savings and

9

loan regulation.

The State of Maryland has filed an

10

amicus brief in this case taking a position similar to

11

ours.

12

One of the things provided in their statute is

13

that a beard of savings and loan association

14

commissioners, consisting of a majority of members

15

engaged in the business, will monitor, and approve or

16

disapprove certain kinds of new practices proposed by

17

institutions practicing in that field in order to

18

determine whether the innovation proposed might

19

undermine the financial stability of the particular

20

savings and loan.

21

Cne could see the temptation that there might

22

be in a board of that sort to reject a competitive

23

innovation by a competitor in the field even though

24

there was no basis for thinking that that innovation

25

would in any way undermine the financial stability of

These hypothetical possibilities and the real

3

cases that we have brought are a bit reminiscent cf cne

4

of this court's classic antitrust decisions that in the

2

against it — every state law school?

3

MR. WALLACE:

It's not inconceivable.

The

4

petitioner is arguing that the remedies must be

5

restricted to remedies under state procedures and in the

6

state courts, but that argument seems to me foreclosed

7

by the court's decision in the City of Eoulder which

8

upheld an antitrust complaint for an injunction where

9

the charge was that restraint of trade was undertaker by

10

public officials and was not pursuant to a policy

11

adopted by the state sovereign.

12

QUESTIONi

Would it be inappropriate for a

13

state law school to decided, as I think some have, that

14

it wishes to have a higher quality of students and

15

require a higher grade of performance before it gives

16

the accolade of a degree?

17

HR. WALLACE;

I rather doubt it.

I haven't

MR. WALLACE:

17

There is not the same

18

opportunity to restrain competition that is involved

19

here.

20

in this case in perspective.

21

That is our point in viewing the issues presented

The mere fact that this is a board of public

22

officials does not mean that all of their activities

23

ipse facto are immune from antitrust regulation.

24

seems to us to follow a fortiori from the decision in

25

the City of Boulder because if that was true of elected

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

That

1

officials responsible for the general welfare of the

2

community alleged to be acting in conformity with the

3

state statute, it has tc be true for these part-time

4

public officials alleged to be acting contrary to the

S

mandate given the by a state statute.
The dissenting judge in the court below

6
7

distinguished the City of Boulder case on the ground

8

that city officials could be mere parochial.

9

the standpoint of antitrust concerns there is a greater

10

parochialism in a group of public officials composed of

11

individuals with a common economic interest than the

12

fact that there may be a geographically restricted point

13

of view about the general public welfare.

Rut frem

There is a clearly stated state policy that

14
15

the board here claims tc be following and that is to

16

administer a bar examination that measures for

17

competence and to report to the state supreme court who

18

dementrated competence on that examination and who did

19

not.

20

in any way reasonably furthers that policy, then they

21

have performed within the immunity in cur view.

22

And, if objectively looked at, what the board did

We do not regard it as a proper inquiry for

23

the courts tc determine what their motivations were, so

24

long as their actions objectively fell within that grant

25

of authority that is a restraint that had tc be

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

contemplated and authorized by the state supreme court

2

in conferring discretion on the board to act anywhere

3

within that range cf authority.

4

the complaint here is that they imposed an artificial

5

limit on the number who could pass the exam in a manner

6

unrelated to competence.

7

Rut the allegation in

It seems to us that that is an allegation that

8

they went beyond the specifically articulated state

9

policy, and an allegation that has to withstand a motion

10

to dismiss the complaint, even though it is quite

11

possible that a case like this can be resolved at the

12

summary judgment stage, without an extensive trial.

13

The fact that the report that they make to the

14

state supreme court is in the form cf a recommendation,

15

seems to us to be a formal distinction from other

16

licensing beards that really dees not preclude the

17

possibility of the imposition, through distorting the

18

state given authority, the imposition of a trade

19

restraint of some significance to antitrust policy, if

20

they know that the report that they have been asked to

21

give will generally be followed, and that report seems

22

to be a report on who demonstrated competence and who

23

did not, but has actually been used for other purposes,

24

and that is what the complaint alleges.
