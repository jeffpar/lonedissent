ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVYN R. LEVENTHAL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEVENTHAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, in this case the state of New York

10

challenges a fee award entered against it under a fee

11

shifting statute.

12

An award of approximately $150 an hour,

13

consisting of a $100 base rate and a 50 percent

14

multiplier, was granted three young attorneys with an

15

average experience of two years when comparable

16

attorneys working for major Wall Street firms were being

17

billed to commercial clients at the rate of $70 an hour.

18

The question presented is whether $150 an hour

19

for attorneys without any billing experience and working

20

for non-profit organizations is reasonable, and more

21

specifically, what standards and procedures should

22

control the inquiry, and what standards and procedures

23

were not followed by the District Court in this case.

24
25

The critical theme in our argument derives
from the fact that we are proceeding under a fee

2

that permeates our argument.

5

Two years after the litigation began,

10

plaintiffs moved for an award of attorneys' fees, and

11

the District Court has ordered us to pay every nickel

12

requested by the plaintiffs.

13

under a fee shifting principle, the District Court has a

14

duty to probe deeply into the fee application of

15

plaintiff's counsel, and because we have a fee shifting

16

statute, the standards and procedures that must be

17

developed by this board must recognize that the state of

18

New York is a captive payor.

Because we are working

19

If the state of New York had had a voice --

20

QUESTION ;

Hr. Leventhal, that is true of any

21

fee shifting statute, isn't it?

22

isn't the first statute that has ever been passed by a

23

legislature saying that the losing party pays the

24

winning party’s attorney's fees.

25

HE. LEVENTHALi

I mean, Section 1988

That's correct.

The principle

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

.

1

applies in every fee shifting statute.

The difficult

2

question presented is how should the hourly rate be

3

calculated for attorneys without relevant billing

4

experience, who don’t have a normal billing rate, who

5

work for profit and non-profit law firms.
There have been developed three approaches to

6
7

this question in our judgment.

8

market approach adopted by the District Court in this
case.

The first is a fictional

It is almost a fanciful approach.

Under it, the

10

court asks for information on awards granted in other

11

civil

12

finds comparable.

13

rights cases or in other cases that the court

When it does so, it doesn *t ask whether there

14

was any information, any evidence submitted in those

15

case which establish what the market rate is, and in

16

fact the court below, by way of illustration, relied

17

upon Becker versus Blum, a case in which the District

18

Court awarded $75 an hour for lawyers with less than two

1

years* experience and $90 an hour for lawyers with mere

20

than two years' experience, without any evidence of what

21

the market rate is.

22

And in fact, in that case, the only comment of

23

the District Court was that the Legal Services

24

Corporation should have asked for more, but there was no

25

evidence in the case of what is in fact a market rate.

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

We therefore view it as entirely fictional.

2

The second approach —

3

QUESTION*

Mr. Leventhal, did you raise your

4

challenge to the use of market rates in calculating

5

these fees in the lower court?
HR. LEVENTHALs

6

Your Honor, we raised in the

7

lower court a claim that the fee award

was exorbitant,

8

and we argued in the Second Circuit for the first time

9

that hourly rates should be based upon costs.

But

10

throughout this litigation we have argued for — under

11

different theories that whatever the rate granted to the

12

plaintiff’s counsel in this case, it was excessive.
QUESTION;

13

Kay I ask, in the same vein, you

14

mentioned at the outset that you never reviewed the time

15

records because they weren’t your client and the court

16

should

17

have an opportunity to have discovery on the time

18

records?

19

probe deeply into the time records.

Did you not

Did you take advantage of it?
MR. LEVENTHALs

Your Honor, it is our view

20

that the plaintiffs have the burden of producing time

21

records and of producing evidence of proper market rate,

22

of an hourly rate that is appropriate.

23

and in response the plaintiffs filed supplemental

24

affidavits which we found inadequate.

25

QUESTION*

We did object,

Did you specifically object to the

6

— Do you question the hours they spent, for example?

2

MB. LEVENTHALs

3

QUESTIONS

Excuse me, sir?

Did you raise any question about

4

the integrity of the time records and the number of

5

hours they claimed to have spent?

6

7

hours they claimed were excessive.

8

Well, Mr. Leventhal, I am

Were the time records themselves filed with

MR. LEVENTHALs

What was filed with the

19

District Court was an affidavit listing the hours

20

expended by counsel.

21

records, contemporaneous time records —

If you are talking about time

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. LEVENTHALs

24

QUESTION;

25

Yes.
— no, Your Honor.

No such records were filed by the

plaintiffs in support of their application?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

MS. LEVENTEALs

1

That's correct.

They claimed

2

that contemporaneous time records were available for a

3

good number of the hours expended, and they conceded

4

that for a good number of the hours expended there were

5

no contemporaneous time records.
QUESTION*

6
7

That was the substance of their

affidavit?

8

HR. LEVENTEALs

9

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

Was there any evidence put in with

10

respect to how many hours a year a lawyer of this status

11

and stature would have?

12

assumed that about 2,000 hours a year is the amount of

13

time a two-year lawyer can put in?

14

HR. LEVENTEALs

In other words, can it be

Your Honor, that is one

15

approximation.

expenditure of time in a year by a lawyer in a private

obligations of running the firm, besides taking care of

23

MR. LEVENTEALs

24

QUESTION!

25

Yes,

sir.

There are studies extant, the

American Bar and others, that lawyers at the lower

1

echelons in the law firm can put in 2,000 charged hours

2

a year.
HR. LEVENTHAL*

3
4

Indeed they can, Your Honor,

and that is relevant -QUESTION*

5

That would mean at the rate they

6

were allowed here these men would be paid at the rate of

7

what?

8

plus the $75?

Over $400,000 a year, wouldn't it?

MR. LEVENTHAL:

9
10

QUESTION;

Oh, I see.

It isn't $150 and then

$75?
MR. LEVENTHAL;

13
14

$150 an hour total, a $100

base rate and a 50 percent multiplier.

11
12

Is it $150

No, Your Honor, it is $100

plus 50 percent.
The second approach that has been used by the

15
16

lower courts is a bona fide market rate approach, and in

17

those cases there is a meaningful effort to obtain

18

information on what is in fact a market rate for a given

19

a ttorn ey.

20

The third approach, a cost basis —

HR. LEVEITHAIs

1

The critical deficiency in the

2

market rate approach, even one that entails a meaningful

3

effort to obtain solid information, is that the

taxpayers of New York are not to be forced to pay two

aspects of that market rate that produce windfalls to a

non-profit lawyer.

Secondly, there is an overhead component in.

the market rate that we think results in windfalls, in

appropriate for a major Wall Street firm that has huge

matter, and is impelled by the demands of its client to

20

provide unusual services.
We don't feel the taxpayers of New York when

those two aspects, those two elements of the market

rate.

insist that it is no mere complicated and no more

20

As the Copeland court recognized in its very brief

21

discussion of this market rate, that inquiry could be

22

very intrusive because it can require documentation, it

23

could require what the court referred to as other

24

submissions, and it can require a hearing, and a very

25

complex hearing.

In a recent decision, this Ramos versus Lamb

1

2

decision, the Tenth Circuit noted that the plaintiffs in

3

that case sought a fee award of approximately $700,003,

4

$700,000, $800,000.

5

disagreed to the tune of $500,000 on what a reasonable

6

market rate would be for those attorneys.

7

that somehow a market rate is easy to calculate is only

8

true when we take the fanciful approach of simply

9

referring to other cases.

So the notion

When you get down to trying to calculate it,

The experts produced in that case

it is very complicated.
QUESTION:

12

It is very intrusive.

Do you think your cost figures

13

would be any more easy to calculate or to ascertain

14

actually?

15

MR. LEVENTHAL:

I think all we have to

18

establish, Your Honor, is that they are not more

17

difficult to ascertain.

18

me that if they are not more difficult to ascertain than

19

a market rate, and if our approach also eliminates

20

windfalls, a critical objective of Congress, our

21

approach is superior.

22

I am not certain.

It seems to .

The second major argument, and I frankly think

23

of it as a subsidiary argument, is the legislative

24

intent argument.

25

to produce what we see as a windfall award.

21

QUESTION;

And hence a windfall, right?

MR. LEVENTHALi

23

The key feature of the legislative history or

24

the key holding of our Congress as the Court recognized

The objective of the Congress was to

assure access to the judicial process.
QUESTION:

Let me just get one thought that

Justice White's question prompted in my mind.

contend that the rate would be different if these were

6

lawyers working for a large New York Hall Street firm

award would have to be higher.

We still think it would

have to be moderate, but it would indeed be higher.
QUESTIONi

11

But you would apply a different

12

standard to a private practitioner than to one working

13

for a

public interest organization?
MR. LEVENTHAL:

We think the private

15

practitioner is entitled to profit, while the non-profit

16

organization ought not to be.

17

inquiries, however, have to be guided by the notion of

18

moderation.

QUESTION:

He think that both

And then, to take the converse for

20

a moment, because there is some discussion about the

21

problem the states have when they hire private counsel

22

in antitrust cases and things like that, I take it the

23

standard there would be the comparable market standard

24

rather than the non-profit standard, because you want to

25

be able to competa in the market for good lawyers.

the winning party has to pay the loser, as the Court

said in the Sierra Club case, it suggests unfairness to

QUESTION;

Certainly, sir.

I think it is relevant to what you

The hourly rate is between $65

to a law firm having served as a law secretary or clerk

21

MR. SILVERMAN;

Your Honor, I do not think

22

that the process would differ.

I do not consider it

23

more difficult to use the prevailing market rate, which

as I say now has a history of decades behind it than to

MB. SILVERMAN;

But in terms of accounting

15

standards, since no law firm that I know of begins tc

that there is disagreement with respect to the upward

upon the exceptional nature of the factors in the

Then you determine whether there should be an

Well, it certainly just didn't

HR. SILVERMAN*

Oh, I do not believe that that

11

depends only upon winning the lawsuit, but in this case

12

the judge held, having looked at comparable cases around

13

the country, that an upward enhancement was justified,

14

as I believe has been held by all of the courts around

15

the country.

You see, if you use the word "bonus," you are

17

using a nasty word, because bonus is sometimes defined

18

as something in addition to a reasonable fee.

19

prefer, as the courts have done, to use the word "upward

20

adjustment" as a part of the reasonable fee, and if it

21

becomes part of the reasonable fee, an upward adjustment

is not, if I may say so, unreasonable.
