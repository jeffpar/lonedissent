ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. BALILES*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The issue in this case is whether the doctrine

9

of judicial immunity bars the award of attorneys’ fees

10

pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1988 against a member of

11

the judiciary acting in his judicial capacity.

12

The facts of this case arose in 1980 in

13

Culpeper County, Virginia.

14

magistrate for that jurisdiction.

16

arrested in Culpeper on misdemeanor charges for which no

16

incarceration was authorized by statute upon

17

conviction.

The Petitioner is a
The Respondents were

When the Respondents were unable to post bond

19

after arrest, they were ordered by a petitioner to be

20

held in jail pending trial.

21

challenged their pretrial detention by filing in the

22

U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of

23

Virginia, a Section 1983 action against the Petitioner

24

seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

25

Respondents thereafter

The District Court declared the Virginia

statues to be unconstitutional as applied, granted

2

injunctive relief, and ordered the petitioner to pay

3

attorneys* fees to the Respondents.

4

of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed that decision

5

and held that members of the judiciary are not immune

8

from suit, are not immune from payment of attorneys*

fees in cases involving equitable or prospective

relief•

The Circuit Court

In this case, we are seeking and asking this

10

Court to hold that awards of attorneys* fees against

11

judges are not authorized because, one, judicial

12

immunity bars such an award , and two —

QUESTIONS

Even if it doesn't bar the

injunction?

15

MR. BALILESs

That is correct.

The Court does

18 not have to reach that point, as I will elaborate in the
17
18

argument.
The second point. Justice White, is that

19

Congress has not abrogated the doctrine of judicial

20

immunity in enacting Section 1988.

21

QUESTIONS

Well, is it your submission or do

22

you take a position as to whether the injunction is

23

permissible?

24
25

MR. EALILES:

We would argue that the

injunctive relief provisions are not permitted by the

QUESTION;

The judge is immune from suit fcr

an injunction as well as damages?

5

HR. BALILES;

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BALILES;

That is correct.

Absolutely.
That is the position we maintain

8

although, as we pointed out in our brief, this Court

9

does not have to reach that question in order to dispose

10

of the question of whether attorneys’ fees may be

11

authorized and ordered to be paid by the judge.
QUESTION:

12

13

I understand that, but you have to

reach one or the other of them.

14

MR. BALILES:

It might be easier to reach the

MR. BALILES;

17
18

Justice White, this Court —

This Court does not have to

reach —

19

QUESTION:

If you are right on it.

20

MR. BALILES:

This Court does not have to

21

reach that question.

The injunctive relief provision

22

was not appealed in this case because of certain changes

23

that were made in the statutes by the General Assembly

24

of Virginia in 1980 and 1981, so that question of

25

injunctive relief is not before the Court.

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

The remaining question is one of the validity

2

of the award of attorneys’ fees which was raised, which

3

was preserved on appeal to the Fourth Circuit and made a

4

part of our petition for certiorari.
So the attorneys’ fees question is really the

5
8

only issue brought to this Court.
QUESTION»

7

Hr. Attorney General, you do have

8

to assume, I suppose, that in some situations

9

prospective relief will be valid.

10

Otherwise you never

get to the attorneys’ fee issue, do you?
HR. BALILESs

11

That is correct.

If this Court

12

holds that judges are liable under 1988, implicit in

13

such a holding is that prospective relief may be ordered

14

against the judge.
QUESTIONS

15

Hell, couldn’t we assume it without

16

deciding it since the only question presented in your

17

petition is the 1988 one?
MR. BALILESs

18

That is correct. Justice

19

Powell.

20

fees, the validity of attorneys’ fees being awarded

21

without determining the question of whether prospective

22

relief is proper when sought against members of the

23

j ud iciary.

25

This Court can reach the question of attorneys’

QUESTIONS

We would say if prospective relief

is available, attorneys’ fees may be awarded.

HR. BALILES:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

Justice White, I would not --

If we happened to disagree with

you, that's what we would say.
MR. BALILES:

That is one position the Court

5

could take.

But this Court can take the position that

6

attorneys' fees are not permissible because the doctrine

7

of judicial immunity bars such an award and because

8

Congress has not authorized it, even if this Court finds

9

that prospective relief is appropriate.

10

QUESTIONS

Would that also apply to mandamus?

11

MR. BALILESi

Justice Marshall, in the case of

12

mandamus and writs of prohibition, the legislature has

13

taken the position not only in Virginia but in certain

14

other states that those are writs that are rarely

15

sought, are seldom granted, and are applicable only

16

under very strict conditions.

17

remedies that are available under certain circumstances

18

would not be applicable here.

19

same questions that are presented to this Court.

20

QUESTION:

Those provisions, those

They do not raise the

Well, do you think that a judge

21

could award attorneys' fees for a mandamus against a

22

state magistrate?

23

Justice Marshall, I am not aware

24

of any such authority for that proposition.

2

Do you know of any authority

against it?
MR. BALILESi

3

Yes, sir.

The ruling of this

4

Court in the Alyeska Pipeline case said specifically

5

that the American rule that barred fee shiftino would

6

not permit the award of attorneys* fees in certain civil

7

rights cases unless Congress specifically authorized

8

such an award.

Congress did that in enactina —

12

QUESTIONi

13

MR. BALILES*

That's correct, Your Honor.

And you can't get attorneys’ fees.
That is correct.

I am not aware

14

of any authority for the awarding of attorneys' fees in

15

that type of action that you have just suggested.
QUESTION*

16
17

And you don't know of any against

it.

18

MR. BALILESi

That is correct.

1

Now, the reason why we are here asking the

20

Court to rule that attorneys' fees are barred by the

21

doctrine of judicial immunity is this*

22

said in damage cases that judges are immune from such

23

liability, and it has set forth certain policy reasons.

24

We submit that those policy reasons apply with equal and

25

compelling force in barrng attorneys' fees to be paid by

this Court has

Well, there is nothing. Justice

Yes, sir.

Is that cut of the case?
No, sir.

Costs as well as

attorneys* fees are involved in this particular case.
QUESTION:

Well, indeed, Congress tried to

treat attorneys* fees as costs, didn’t it?
MR. BALILES:

Congress in this particular

12

case. Justice O'Connor, did not deal with the question

13

of costs or attorneys' fees with respect to judges being

14

the subject of monetary awards.

15
10
17

QUESTION:

But under the statute, did it not

attempt to treat attorneys* fees as costs?
MR. BALILES:

It mentions attorneys' fees and

18

costs being available for award by the Court in its

19

discretion to the prevailing party, that is correct.

20

21
22

QUESTION:

Am I correct in my impression that

the Commonwealth did pay these fees?
MR. BALILES:

It is not reflected in the

23

record as such, but the magistrate in this case sought a

24

special appropriation from the Executive Secretary of

25

the Supreme Court of Virginia’s office, and it was

In damage cases against judges, this Court has

3

said r epeatedly that the doctrine of judicial immunity

4

is ess ential.

5

judici ary, and it is essential and necessary in order to

8

promot e fearless, principled decisionmaking.

And yet

10

The fi nancial impact of attorneys' fees in todays

11

litiga tion can be just as chilling,

12

as tho se that may be included in an award for damages.

13

Now, the issue before this Court is critical

14

becaus e if the Court sanctions the award of attorneys'

15

fees i n this case, it will have implicitly limited the

16

For example, this Court has said in dealing

with d amage cases that judges should not be subjected to

required in equitable relief cases.
Equitable relief cases can have the same

3
4

chilling effect on judges as damage actions because

5

sanctions inherent in the injunctive relief process also

6

include fines and imprisonment which are just as

7

intimidatiung and pernicious as money damages.
At the very heart of the judicial immunity

doctrine is the concern that there be no chilling effect

on independent judicial decisionmaking caused by the

11

threat of lawsuits.

12

the type of relief sought in a suit.

13

not simply because a judge may be subject to some

pecuniary loss, but because the threat cf a lawsuit is

intimidating, and that is not in the interest of the

public.

17

But the chill arises regardless of
The chill occurs

In short, what you have is the possibility

18

that a judge would pull his punches instead of

19

exercising the independence cf judgment required by

20

one’s public responsibilities, and that is the threat to

21

the integrity of the judicial system, regardless of

22

whether the suit is one for damages or whether it is

seeking injunctive or declaratory relief*

compelling reason why judges should not be liable for

it.

17

when the 1976 Civil Bights Attorneys* Fees Award Act was

there was no clear indication by Congress when it

Similarly, in the case of Tenney v. Brandhove,

10

this Court found that when Congress passed Section 1983,

11

there was no clear indication that it intended to repeal

12

the doctrine of legislative immunity, and therefore the

13

language in 1983 that says ever person did not mean

General Rallies, what do you make

of the reference to the House report relied on by the

Fourth Circuit that is contained at page 30 and 31 of

HR. BALILES:

8

9

Justice Rehnquist,

the Court of

Appeals below referred to a paragraph containing two

10

sentences and a footnote as the basis for its conclusion

11

that Congress had abrogated the common law doctrine of

12

judicial immunity.

13

House report doesn't simply support that conclusion.

14

Indeed, there is no reference in that report itself to

15

the doctrine of judicial immunity.

16

the Senate report.

17

the Senate bill, and so the Senate bill and the Senate

18

report

19

nd the House report.

The court below was wrong.

The

It is not found in

In fact, what the House passed was

were really before the House, not the House bill

But notwithstanding that,

20

the House report

21

cited by the court below is an ambiguous reference at

22

best, and this is ironic.

23

this Court's decision in Pierson v. Ray where the

24

standard said there must be a clear indication by

25

Congress.

That footnote referred to

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

So the fact that that case is cited in the

2

footnote at least should suggest that Congress had tc be

3

aware of the standards set by this Court in Pierson/

4

that there must be a clear indication, a specific

5

provision, and you won’t find it in that report.

6

I suspect that the reference to the Pierson

7

case in that footnote. Justice Rehnquist, is simply a

8

reference to the case because that case also involved

9

not only judicial immunity but the qualified or good

10

faith immunity of police officers who were also subject

11

to that lawsuit.

12

In light of the standards that have been set

13

by this Court in the Pierson case for determining what

14

Congress intended, this Court should find that Congress

15

did not intend for Section

16

the award of attorneys’ fees against a member of the

17

judiciary for acts undertaken in his judicial capacity.

1988 legislation to authorize

18

Now, there is precedent for this Court to hold

19

that the judicial immunity doctrine embraces both damage

20

cases and actions for equitable relief.

21

that both federal and state legislators are absolutely

22

immune from civil actions, regardless of whether the

23

actions are for damages or whether they are speaking

24

prospective relief.

25

the policy reasons for legislative immunity are

This Court held

And here is the interesting parti

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

identical to the policy reasons for judicial immunity

2

The common law origins are similar, and that is the

3

purpose being to protect the integrity and the

4

independence of the decisionmaker, to protect the

5

independence and the integrity of the judicial system,

6

and to prevent the distraction of attention from one's

7

public responsibility.
And because the policies underlying the

8

9

doctrines of legislative and judicial immunity are

10

identical and the common law origins are similar, common

11

sense would dictate that the rules also should be

12

similar.

13

Say it please the Court, this is the botto m

find that Congress did not intend to abrogate the common

And the Petitioner thinks that this Court can

and should reach the larger issue, the broader question

If you did, if a legislator acted in some

situation in which relief is given.

the point this Court made in Consumers Onion.

Going back to the Attorney

12

General's point that judges might be just as

13

apprehensive or nearly as apprehensive about the

14

prospect of attorneys' fees being awarded against them

15

as damages, have you given any thought to the fact that

16

in quite a number of cases, under 1988, judges,

17

including federal judges, have awarded costs against the

18

non pre vailing party , and the judge. if he has be en doing

principle was killed in Alyeska.

QUESTIONS

Judges have never been considered

No, but is there a history of suing

11

judges for prospective relief?

12

MS. WYATTs

There certainly is. Your Honor, or

13

we would not have had an anti-injunction act almost from

14

the time this country began, and we certainly have cases

15

such as Mitchum v. Foster, Boddie v. Connecticut which

16

really would be thrown out into the twilight zone if

this Court were to held that there was now, for the

18

first time, immunity from prospective relief.

19

QUESTIONS

20

anti-injunction act, you don’t have to sue the judge.

21

You sue the party that is the beneficiary of the state

Do you think so?
For my case it could be.

I don't

18

think there's any sound reason for doing so, but in

those cases, the federal court must retain the ability

to stop them, and Congress has said with that
