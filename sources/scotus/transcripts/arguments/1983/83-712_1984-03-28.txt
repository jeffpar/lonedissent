We will hear arguments next

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NODES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court, this Court granted certiorari to the New Jersey Supreme

10

Court in this case on the issue of the applicability of the

11

Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, the school searches conducted

12

by school teachers and school officials.

13

In this case, the respondent was observed smoking a

14

cigarette in a school restroom by a teacher.

15

the student to the vice principal's office, and reported the

16

incident to the vice principal.

17

the student not only denied having smoked in the restroom, but

18

also stated that it couldn't have been her because she didn't

19

even smoke.

20

The teacher took

After the vice principal left,

After — following this statement, the vice principal

21

asked for the student's purse, and opened the student's purse,

22

finding a pack of cigarettes lying on the top.

23

the cigarettes and said something to the effect of, "You lied to

24

me about smoking cigarettes,"looked back in the purse, and saw

25

rolling papers for cigarettes.

He picked up

He believed these were indicative

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

of the presence of drug paraphernalia in the purse, and continued

2

to look through the purse.

3

indications that the marijuana was in the purse for purposes of

4

distribution.

QUESTION:

He found marijuana and other

Mr. Nodes, under New Jersey law, can a

minor consent to a search?

7

MR. NODES:

I don't think there would be any distinc­

8

tion under New Jersey law between a minor consenting to a search

9

and an adult consenting.

New Jersey has a slightly stricter

10

standard than the federal standard concerning consent, and it

11

would have been absolutely necessary that the juvenile be aware

12

of her rights prior to the search taking place in order for it.

13

to be a consent search.

14

conceded that it was not a consent search.

The trial court and the appellate division in New
Jersey —

QUESTION:

You left out one item in the pocketbook,

the $40.

MR. NODES:

QUESTION:

21

MR. NODES: Yes.

22

QUESTION:

23

Because of this, the state has always

I beg your pardon?
You left out one item in the pocketbook —

— which was $40 in $1 bills, which

signified that she was selling it.

24

MR. NODES:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
You left that out.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. NODES:

There were also pieces of paper indicating

2

that various other people, Johnny, people like that, owed her

3

$1, $1.25, things like that, and all these items were entered

4

into evidence at the juvenile delinquency proceeding against

5

T.L.O., and they were all evidence of an intention to

6

distribute the marijuana which was found in the purse.

7

T.L.O. was adjudicated a delinquent as a result of

8

the evidence which was found, and the trial court and the New

9

Jersey Appellate Division found that the search was totally

10

proper.

11

search exceeded reasonable grounds, and therefore found that it

12

was required to exclude the evidence which had been found in

13

the search.

14

However, the New Jersey Supreme Court found that the

Now, in reaching this decision, the New Jersey Supreme

15

Court found that due to the amount of state action involved, that

16

the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution would

17

apply to this situation, and we have not protested this ruling.

18

In addition, the New Jersey Supreme Court found that in order

19

for a search to be reasonable under the United States Constitu­

20

tion in the school search context the person conducting the

21

search must have reasonable grounds to believe that the search

22

will uncover evidence of a crime or evidence of a violation of

23

school discipline or school regulations.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Nodes, in your question presented for

certiorari, you say whether the Fourth Amendment exclusionary
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

rule applies to searches made by public school officials and

2

teachers in school.

3

talking perhaps about an administrative proceeding where someone

4

has been kicked out of school, wondering whether the exclusionary

5

rule would apply in that, but here the exclusionary rule is

6

applied by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in connection with a

7

criminal prosecution of this person, was it not?

8
9

MR. NODES:

Now, the unwary might think that you were

Yes, it was applied in connection with a

juvenile delinquency prosecution.

The rules in New Jersey would

10

be the same whether it was a juvenile delinquency prosecution or

11

a criminal prosecution.

12

QUESTION:

So what we are really talking about here

13

is the standard supporting a search, aren't we, in a school,

14

rather than whether the exclusionary rule applies in this

15

proceeding?

16

MR. NODES:

Well, the primary motion that was made

17

by the defendant was for exclusion of the evidence, and the first

18

question that had to be reached by the New Jersey court was

19

whether or not under any circumstances there could be exclusion

20

of evidence illegally taken in the school situation.

21

answer to that question was no, under no circumstances would

22

this type of evidence be excluded, then setting a standard

23

wouldn't be absolutely necessary.

24

be in controversy.

25

If the

That would no longer really

In the case, the New Jersey Supreme Court did do both.
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

It did set the standard and it also ruled that exclusion was

2

warranted.

QUESTION:

And so your argument I take it is primarily

addressed to the standard?
MR. NODES:

No, our argument here is primarily addresse

to the exclusionary rule issue.
QUESTION:

We basically agree —

Well, do you think it is open to us to deal

with the reasonableness of the search?
MR. NODES:

I believe that could be considered a

question subsumed within the —

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. NODES:

But it wasn't your intention to raise it?
It wasn't our intention to raise it because

13

we agree with the standard that was set forth by the New Jersey

14

Supreme Court.

15
16
17

We feel that that is a workable standard.

QUESTION:

Courts around the country have differed

somewhat on that standard, have they not?
MR. NODES:

Yes, they have.

In this whole area there

18

has been a great deal of difference.

19

which have held that’.the Fourth Amendment — they have gone all

20

the way from saying the Fourth Amendment doesn't even apply to

21

saying that.the Fourth -Amendment always applies and exclusion

22

is always needed.

23

There have been courts

The reason we didn't specifically address the issue,

24

though, of the standard, we believe both counsel have addressed

25

that issue in their briefs, in footnotes, and we have set forth
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

arguments, and the arguments were made before the New Jersey

2

Supreme Court, is, the reason we didn't address it is because we

3

think the New Jersey Supreme Court set forth a good standard and

4

a workable standard.

5

QUESTION:

6

Supreme Court of New Jersey?

7

MR. NODES:

What exactly is your quarrel with the

Our quarrel with the Supreme Court of New

8

Jersey is that we do not feel that the exclusionary rule works

9

as a deterrent in the school search situation, and bedause of

10

that we don't feel that exclusion of evidence from a later

11

criminal proceeding should ever occur when the search was

12

instituted by school teachers and school officials.

13

QUESTION:

So teachers and’ school administrators

14

should not be treated the same way as policemen and law

15

enforcement —

16
17
18
19

20

MR. NODES:

That is our primary contention.

Yes, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Has the exclusionary rule been applied in

other administrative search contexts?
MR. NODES:

Yes, it has been applied in other — in

21

exclusionary — in other administrative search contexts, such as

22

OSHA searches —

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. NODES:

25

Or fire protection people, and so forth?
Well, yes.

I am not certain that those

are actually administrative searches.

The people involved in

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

them were searching for evidence of arson, which is definitely a

2

crime, and it often wasn't a firefighter per se.

3
4

QUESTION:

based on a deterrence rationale?

5

6

MR. NODES:

I believe that certainly with the fire­

fighters --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. NODES:

9

QUESTION:

10

In the other context, do you think it was

In administrative contexts?
Yes, I believe it was.

The persons who --

But you somehow think that school officials

can't be deterred?

11

MR. NODES:

I think it is much less likely that a

12

school official will be deterred.

13

believe in both Clifford and Tyler, the real persons who were

14

doing most of the searching were either fire inspectors or

15

police who were called in by fire inspectors, and they were

16

very definitely searching for evidence of a very serious crime.

17

It wasn'.t an administrative search, and the other searches that

18

are closer to pure administrative searches, such as Cameron and

19

Barlows, cases like that, the persons who were doing the searches

20

on a regular basis conducted searches for violations of civil

21

regulations and administrative regulations.

22

primary duty, and the purpose of the search was to find violations,

23

and it was clear that that evidence would be presented in the

24

trial.

25

The firefighter, and I

That was their primary function.

That was their

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

QUESTION:

Well, is it your view that school

2

officials, regardless of the exclusionary rule's application,

3

would continue to do what they always have done?

4

MR. NODES:

It is our contention that the exclusionary

5

rule has very little effect on a school teacher., We feel that

6

there are other means of teaching school teachers compliance with

7

the Constitution and ensuring that there is compliance with the

8

Constitution.

9

QUESTION:

Well, if that is so, then how can you

10

square that with your argument that the application of the rule

11

will create havoc in the schools? It just seems inconsistent.

12

MR. NODES:

Well, I think that what it is is that if

13

the exclusionary rule is to be applied, and if it is to have

14

any effect, it can work only under very limited circumstances.

15

I think that one of the journals pointed out in the respondent'£

16

brief, the Journal of Law and Education set forth the way the

17

exclusionary rule could work, and basically the journal suggested

18

that in the school situation administrators and teachers could

19

identify people in schools who were likely to cause trouble.

20

They could watch where these students went, and make notes of

21

where they went.

22

with and make notes of that.

23

They could watch who these students associated

They could make notes of whether the people — the

24

students seemed to sometimes be intoxicated, seemed to be acting

25

beligerent, seemed to be cutting classes, seemed to be late a
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

great deal of time.

2

in order for the rule to work, school teachers are going to have

3

to turn into policemen, and they have to turn into policemen who

4

will develop a dossier on a student before conducting a search.

5

QUESTION:

And basically, what it sounds like is that

Mr. Attorney General, in this particular

6

case, if the girl involved had a locked briefcase, would it have

7

been all right to break it open?

8
9

MR. NODES:

I think this case presents a difficult

question, and it was a question obviously in the New Jersey

10

Supreme Court, in the New Jersey courts, and that is why there

11

was a split.

12

that the person had an expectation of privacy.

13

standard set up by the New Jersey Supreme Court —

A locked briefcase would show an added indication

Well, I think that the —
Have you ever seen a woman that didn't

take her pocketbook without a purse?
MR. NODES:

Possibly not, Your Honor, but I think that

19

it was a standard set up by the New Jersey Supreme Court.

court indicated that the greater the intrusion, the more

21

significant the intrustion, the higher the standard would have

to be in any event.

That could be classified as free-wheeling.
I think it would better be classifdd as a

common sense approach which school teachers can actually use.

2

QUESTION:

But sometimes — anyway.

3

QUESTION:

General Nodes, let me just ask you this

4

question, if I may, following up on what Justice O'Connor was

5

asking you, on the effect of what you are asking for.

6

challenging the standard or the application of the standard in

7

this case.

8

that the exclusionary rule simply doesn't apply in the criminal

9

context when the search is made by a school official*

You are no

You are taking a broad position, as I understand you,

10

MR. NODES:

11

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
But as I understand the New Jersey court,

12

it would permit these searches to go ahead and let the results

13

of the search be used for school disciplinary purposes and

14

management of the school without any deterrent whatsoever.

15
16

MR. NODES:

Okay.

not specifically addressed that issue, and has not said that.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. NODES: No.

19

QUESTION:

20
21

The New Jersey Supreme Court has

But this case doesn't preclude that.

All this case deals with is whether after

the material is obtained it can be used for criminal purposes.
MR. NODES: That is correct.

I would note that a

22

chancery judge in New Jersey did rule in this case that evidence

23

would be excluded from the disciplinary proceeding.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. NODES:

But that is not before us.
That is not before us,

and that is a

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

single opinion that wasn't contested.

2

really that the exclusionary rule shouldn't apply in a criminal

3

trial when the search was conducted by school officials.

4

QUESTION:

5

violation might be.

6

Our only contention is

And that is no matter how flagrant the

MR. NODES':

Yes, we think that regardless of how

7

flagrant it would be, the standard would be the same, the

8

application of the exclusionary rule would have very little

9

effect, and that is the problem.

10
11

We just don't believe the

effect is there.
This Court has often noted that there is a balancing

12

test that must be used in determining whether or not the

13

exclusionary rule would be applied in any context.

14

in United States v. Havens, the Court allowed excludable evidence

15

to be used for purposes of impeachment.

16

Colandra, possibly excludable evidence was allowed to be

17

presented before a grand jury.

18

allowed evidence which had actually been suppressed, quashed in

19

a state criminal proceeding to be introduced in a federal civil

20

proceeding.

21

additional benefits of allowing certain seizure points to be

22

raised in the federal habeas corpus context would be slight in

23

relation to the costs.

24
25

For instance,

In United States v.

In U.S. v. Janis, the Court

In Stone v. Powell, this Court found that the

I think that all these cases have centered very squarelj^
on the idea that a balancing test must be used, that the
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

exclusionary rule has as its purpose the deterrent

2

effect/ and that we must be sure that that deterrent

3

effect outweighs any detriments of the exclusionary rule

4

before we will automatically apply the rule.
I believe that the benefits cf applying the

5
6

exclusionary rule to the school search situation are

7

really very limited and very questionable.

8

The rule in

effect punishes law enforcement.officers for

9

transgressions which are committed by law enforcement

10

officers and transgressions themselves and ether law

enforcement officers.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN J. NODES, ESQ.,

5

CN BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - RESUMED

6

MR. NODESi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7

please the Court, at the recess I was trying to explain

8

that our position is that the benefits of applying the

9

exclusionary rule to the school search situation would

10
11

be very questionable.
The idea of the rule is to punish law

12

enforcement offers for offenses committed by themselves

13

or constitutional transgressions committed by themselves

14

and by other law enforcement officers.

15

that those who are incharge of formulating policies for

10

law enforcement will be the persons most greatly

17

affected, since they will be the prosecutors who will

18

lose cases if there is not compliance with the

19

Constitution .

20

Because of this,

It is thought

the rule is thought to have

21

the effect of causing education of the police officers

22

and detectives and investigators who actually conduct

23

searches, and by this means the entire law enforcement

24

community will be given an incentive to comply with the

25

Constitution.

15

This simply will not work with school

1
2

teache rs, because they are net a part of this law

3

enf ore ement community, and

4

than 1 aw enforcement office rs.

13

is so secondary, the benefi ts of the exclusionary ru la

14

in the school search situat icn would be even less th an

15

16

7

criminal laws and respect for cur system of criminal

justice in general.

9

the major detriment has, of course,

This is

But as Justice Powell writing for the Court in

10

Stone v. Powell noted, the indiscriminate use of the

11

exclusionary rule could actually have the opposite of

12

the intended effect.

13

disrespect for our criminal laws, and could actually

14

nurture disrespect for our system of criminal justice.

15

It could actually nurture

This is obviously a detriment any time the

16

exclusionary rule is possibly extended.

17

may be even greater in the school search situation

18

because disrespect of our criminal laws and disrespect

19

of the system of justice is not a lessen which we should

20

teach our students.

21

This detriment

Therefore, before the exclusionary rule is

22

applied to school searches by school teachers and

23

officials, it should be very clear that the benefits of

24

the rule outweigh the detriments, and that there are no

25

other means of exacting compliance with the

17

We believe that the detriments have been

1

Constitution

2

set forth very clearly and that the benefits are very

3

limited, and the only way that we could really get a

4

beneficial effect from the exclusionary rule in a school

5

search situation so that it would foster compliance with

6

the Constitution is to have teachers act as policemen,

7

to have teachers follow the same rules as policemen, for

8

teachers to actually investigate as policemen.
I suggest that this would totally change the

9
10

educational system in this country.
QUESTION:

11

May I ask one question on this?

12

Justice C'Connor pointed out before lunch, there is

13

apparently some diversity among the states as to what

14

the right standard is, but we don't reach

15

question.

the exclusionary rule does not apply?

MR. NODES:

5

But in addition to this detriment that would

les, sir.

6

occur fcy either — by changing the school system, by

7

using the exclusionary rule and by forcing school

8

teachers to act as policemen, we believe that the

9

exclusionary rule is unnecessary because there are other

10

deterrents in the school situation which will really

11

work.
As this Court noted in Ingram v.

12

Wright, the

13

school situation is different than many other

14

situations.

15

deal of community interest and a great deal of parental

16

interest.

17

found that if corporal punishment in a public school

18

went too far, the community pressures in addition to

19

possible criminal proceedings and possible civil

20

proceedings would have the effect of stopping further

21

We suggest that this would be at least as true
in a school search situation, and we suggest that the
mere egregious a search, the more chances the deterrence
would occur.

If a student gees home and complains to

19

his parent that he has just been the subject of an

2

unreasonable search, there is a high likelihood that the

parent will complain tc the principal or to the beard of

6

the basis of that complaint.

21

the final analysis is, we will find that if unreasonable

There is also the chance of bringing a tcrt

However, in the situation of an unreasonable

We believe that these cases teach another

necessities for making sure that there is discipline in

The Court has determined that because of the

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOIS DE JULIO,

ESQ.,

ON EEHALF OF THE RESONDENTS

3

MS. DE JULIO*

4
5

Ms. DeJulio?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
This case arises in the factual setting of the

6
7

public school system, but I would urge the Court net to

8

let the context obscure the fact that the issues

9

presented here are not ones of educational policy, but

10

are rather ones of criminal law.

The question is not

11

whether or under what circumstances schools may regulate

12

the conduct of their students.

13

school may use certain types of evidence in its own

14

internal disciplinary proceedings to form the basis for

15

imposing school sanctions.

It is not whether this

Rather, the question is whether a court of law

10
17

may permit an individual to be convicted of a crime

18

based upon evidence illegally seized from him by a

19

government official.
QUESTION*

20

Suppose, Ms. DeJulio, that all of

21

these events that took place here took place not in the

22

principal's office, tut after the young lady got heme,

23

and it

was her mother, not the school teacher.

24

MS. DE JULIO:

25

QUESTION*

Well, Your Honor --

And lay aside for a minute how the

25

1

pelice get the evidence, but dc you think the Fourth

2

Amendment enters that setting?
MS. DE JULIO:

3

Your Honor, the Fourth

4

Amendment has never been applied to actions by purely

5

private citizens, and certainly a parent would be acting

6

in a purely private capacity.

7

distinguished between the teacher acting as a state

8

official and the parent acting in a parental role.

9

one time, courts held that the teacher acted in loco

10

parentis, that is to say, instead of the parent, and

11

that doctrine may well have accorded with facts of the

12

educational system as it stood 200 years ago, when the

13

parent would hire a tutor cr select a private school

14

that would carry out the parents’

15

philosophy and disciplinary standards.

However, courts have

But in today's modern compulsory system of

education, the teacher serves a very different role.

Supreme Court set forth did not prevent teachers or

educators from conducting searches.

It merely required

NS. DE JULIO;

With regard tc the application

of the exclusionary rule, we would submit that if an

improper search were conducted by a governmental

8

employee, and I would --

9

QUESTION;

Well, let's assume that the nurse

10

had probable cause to believe that there were cigarettes

11

there and when the purse was opened found marijuana.

12

MS. DE JULIO;

Well, if that were found tc be

13

correct, if there were probable cause, then that wculd

14

be a constitutionally permissble search.

15

not, it might be that the exclusionary rule would apply

16

in that circumstance, depending on whether the actions

17

of the nurse were considered --

18
19
20

QUESTION;

However, if

If the court found the search was

not reasonable, the exclusionary rule wculd apply?
MS. DE JULIO;

If the court found as a matter

21

of fact, and I don't know, because I am not aware of the

22

circumstances in state hospitals, whether the actions of

23

a state hospital employee wculd constitute governmental

24

action for Fourth Amendment purposes.

25

QUESTION;

A state hospital would be similar

28

1

in that respect, wouldn't it, to a public school?
MS. DE JULIO;

2

I could certainly see some very

3

definite similarities, and I would, without knowing

4

more, conclude that that may be the case.
QUESTION:

5
6

Sc the hospital would be in the

same situation generally that the school is?
MS. DE JULIO;

7

In that circumstance, it may

8

very well.

Again, the circumstances that I am not aware

9

of might lead a court to conclude that it would not be

10

state action, but with regard to schools and educational

11

officials, the vast majority of state courts and lower

12

federal courts which have considered the question have

13

found that school authorities, at least in our modern

system of compulsory education —

What dc you think the Fourth

MS. DE JULIO:

22

the standard that the New

25

viewed to be a significantly less stringent standard

MS. DE JULIO;

And I think that is why the New

Jersey court and many ether state courts found that the

schools to comply with because, as my adversary noted,

schools are not primarily involved in investigating

criminal conduct.

QUESTION;

16

Ms. DeJulic, are you suggesting

17

that the presence of exigent circumstances dispenses

18

with the need for probable cause as well as the need for

19

a warrant?
MS. DE JULIO;

20

No, Your Honor.

In our

21

position before the New Jersey State Supreme Court, we

22

argued

23

when a full search was being conducted.

24

distinguish between the less intrusive search, such as

25

the frisk for a weapon, which might arise in the school

that probable cause should be the required test

32

We obviously

1

setting because obviously the police would only have to

2

meet a reasonable suspicion test in that circumstance,

3

and we conceded that if a school authority had

4

reasonable suspicion to believe that a

5

and dangerous, that the lesser standard would be

6

justified in that circumstance as well.
QUESTION:

7
8

student was armed

Do you think a Terry standard would

be enough then?
MS. DE JULIO:

9

Well, certainly in a weapons

10

situation if we hold the police to that standard I think

11

it would be difficult to argue that we should not allow

12

educators to act in that circumstance on the basis of

13

reasonable suspicion or reasonable grounds, but again,

14

the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that the

15

reasonable grounds was the standard that they would

16

adopt for all school searches, regardless of the purpose

17

or the nature of the substance being searched for, with

18

the caveat that as the search became more intrusive, the

19

reasonable grounds would more closely approach probable

20

cause.
QUESTION:

21
22
23

Do you agree that issue isn’t

befcre us?
MS. DE JULIO:

Your Honor, it is not befcre

24

this Court as I understand it because the New Jersey

25

Supreme Court found the search of the juvenile to be

33

1

unreasonable. Therefore we were not in a position tc

2

petition, and the state did not take issue, as I

3

understand it, with the nature of the standard which the

4

New Jersey Supreme Court adopted.
QUESTION:

5

Sc you think as it comes tc us we

6

must accept the notion that there was no — not even

7

reasonable suspicion or reasonable grounds.
MS. DE JULIO:

8
9

I think the facts of the case

do support the conclusion that there was no reasonable

10

basis for the search at the outset.

11

Jersey Supreme Court made the further finding that even

12

if the initial opening of the purse had been reasonable,

13

the scope of the search enlarged far beyond the

14

reasonableness that would have justified the opening of

15

the purse.

10

Moreover, the New

The principal testified that he opened the

17

purse looking for tobacco cigarettes, and that he saw a

18

package of Marlboro cigarettes sitting right on top.

19

that point, he had dene all that one could argue would

20

be reasonable by any stretch of the imagination, but he

21

then proceeded to remove the cigarettes, observe the

22

rolling papers, which he then felt gave him a basis to

23

go further, to open up zippered compartments, to read

24

personal papes which the student had.

25

QUESTION:

Well,

when he found the Marlboro

34

At

1

cigarettes, he had more evidence towards probable cause

2

than he did before he found them, because she had said,

3

I don’t smoke, and that shows that she lied as to saying

4

that she didn't smoke, and therefore supports an

5

inference that she lied in her other denials.
MS. DE JULIO:

6

Well, Your Honor, I think it is

7

a close case, but I think that we have to keep in mind

8

that in this school, unlike many others, smoking was not

9

per se forbidden.

The school permitted students tc

10

smoke in certain designated areas, so that many students

11

would be lawfully carrying cigarettes in their purses or

12

pockets.

13

not proof positive either that the juvenile had been

14

smoking in the girls’ room, which was net a specially

15

designated area.

16

So that the search for cigarettes really was

QUESTION:

Nc, but it was proof positive that

17

she had lied, or a very strong inference that she had

18

lied when she said she didn’t smoke.

19

MS. DE JULIO:

Your Honor, I think it may have

20

been seme evidence, tut I don't think It was conclusive

21

in that the fact that she was carrying cigarettes did

22

not prove that she herself smoked.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

No, but I mean, ycu don’t need a

whole lot more than that, I don’t think.
MS. DE JULIO:

Well, as I would be happy tc

35

1

concede, I think that it is a close case, and that the

2

facts would support, however, the conclusion that the

3

New Jersey Supreme Court made.

suggested yourself, there is only one question here, the

when the state is attempting to utilize the fruits of

17

its illegal conduct on its direct case in chief in a

criminal matter, that the exclusionary rule must be

19

applied.

20

decisions of this Court have indicated that the

21

exclusionary rule is net constitutionally mandated in

22

every circumstance where Fourth Amendment violation

23

occurs, those cases have not in any way affected the

The Fourth Amendment protects against intrusions into

personal privacy.

bubble gum in a school context or whether it be for a

The law is

Well,

why wouldn't the answer be

16

the same?

If the school officer has violated the

17

constitutional rights cf the student, why would the

18

evidence be usable against him?
MS. DE JULIO:

19

The mere recent decisions cf

20

this Court have distinguished between the types of

21

proceedings in which the exclusionary rule would be

22

applied.

23

argument that a school disciplinary proceeding might

24

well be the type of proceeding to which we would want to

25

apply the exclusionary rule.

I could certainly make very substantial

However, I think that we recognize that while

2

people may suffer substantial detriments in civil ca ses

3

that v e apply to criminal prosecutions because we

reccgn ize that the consequences there are even mere

Certainly if this matter had come up on the

from the ruling of the chancery court in this

10

matter

that the evidence could not have been utilized to

impose a disciplinary sanction, it would be a very

made o n both sides would be very different.

That was

I do feel that perhaps the briefs filed by the

17
18

amicus curiae in this case, the school boards

19

associ ations, really address arguments that ought to be

20

made a t some point in an appropriate appeal where the

21

issue was whether the illegally seized evidence could be

QUESTION:

2

Ms. DeJulio, may I ask you a

3

somewhat different type question?

4

that many states conduct rather intensive educational

5

programs for police officers tc make sure that they know

6

their duty and the basic legal principles applicable to

7

the performance of those duties.

8

instituted any such programs for the education of its

9

teachers?
MS. DE JULIO:

I am sure you krcn

Had New Jersey

Your Honor, I was called by the

11

New Jersey Department of Education subsequent to the

12

decision in the state court, and they indicated to me

13

that they were interested in making that kind of

14

training available, tut then the petition for certiorari

15

was filed, and I believe the matter has been held in

16

abeyance pending the outcome of the matter in this

17

Court.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

How many public school teachers are

there in New Jersey?
MS. DE JULIO:

I would not have any estimate.

21

I couldn't begin to tell you.

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Do you have any idea how much

instruction New Jersey gives its police officers?
MS. DE JULIO:

Your Honor, I don't know.

I

would suggest, however, that the test which was involved

41

1

in this case is a very simple one.

2

a very flexible, very easy concept to understand, and I

3

think that in dealing with teachers and school

4

authorities, we are by definition dealing with a very

5

educated, highly motivated group of people.
QUESTION*

6

Reasonable ground is

But we have exclusionary rule cases

7

at every term of this Court, and I am told by law

8

enforcement officers that every time we hand down a new

9

decision, that requires a new briefing of the police.

10

MS. DE JULIO*

11

QUESTION*

12

Well, certainly, Your Honor --

Is it your idea that should be done

in the public school system?
MS. DE JULIO: I think that public school

13
14

teachers are already on a continuing basis being made

15

aware of a variety of legal concepts that do impact upon

16

education.

17

laws,

18

litigation and many statutes and many regulations.

19
20
21

We live in a modern society, with many, many

and certainly schools are the subject of much

QUESTION:

And this also would have to be done

in the hospitals?
MS. DE JULIO:

Well , Yo ur Honor, as I

22

i n d ic a ted , I think that might be the case if it were

23

found that the action cf a state hospital or a state

24

instit ution rose to the level of governmen t action for

25

Fourth Amendment purposes.

Alse, I think that it is

42

1

fair to say that when you are dealing with a complicated

2

educational system, the continuing education of teachers

3

in all aspects is something that is rather routine.

4

This could be very easily incorporated into that kind of

5

ongoing training that teachers are getting in their

6

academic fields and other related areas.

7

Perhaps ironically, many teachers themselves

8

are responsible for teaching their students

9

constitutional principles.

As a history teacher, I was

10

required to teach constitutional law to my students.

11

I think we are dealing with a core of people and a core

12

of expertise that is mere than adequate to deal with

13

whatever demands the legal standard may require.

14

QUESTION!

Sc

Ms. DeJulio, when the principal saw

15

the pocketbook and knew the facts around it, what then

18

could he do legally in your mind?

17

MS. DE JULIO:

How much?

I believe that when he -- he

18

should net have opened the pocketbook.

19

the search of the pocketbook was independent of --

20

QUESTION!

21

MS. DE JULIO:

I believe that

What could he have done?
I think he could have imposed a

22

sanction upon the student based upon the testimony of

23

the teacher who observed her smoking a cigarette in a

24

non-permitted area.

25

QUESTION:

And that is it?

43

1

MS. DE JULIO*

And that wculd have been the

2

extent of it.

3

posessory offense, and the search of her purse wculd

4

have been a fishing expedition.

I think we are not dealing with a

QUESTION:

Ms. DeJulic, you have private

secondary schools in New Jersey, don't you?

7

MS. DE JULIO*

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

Suppose the same facts here took

place in a private school, and instead of being a public

10

school principal it was a headmaster or headmistress.

11

Different case?

12

MS. DE JULIO: That may very well present a

13

different case, because the Fourth Amendment has been

14

held not to apply to private citizens such as cases

15

involving employers searching employees' desk drawers

16

and it may be that a private school teacher, since

17

private schools are different, and are perhaps not

18

subject to the same regulations and standards, and are

19

not an arm of the government --

20
21

QUESTION:

So if a youngster wants to get into

drugs, he had better stay in the public school side?

22

(General laughter.)

23

MS. DE JULIO*

Well, Your Honor, I think that

24

that is very much oversimplifying, and I think it is

25

ignoring the fact that the rule imposed by the New

44

1

Jersey Supreme Court would not prevent a teacher from

2

conducting a search if he had reasonable grounds tc

3

believe that a student had drugs in a purse or a pocket,

4

and I think that the cases are -- the reported cases are

5

legion where searches were conducted under a reasonable

6

grounds or reasonable suspicion test in various states,

7

and the teachers were upheld because they did have seme

8

reason to believe that the student either possessed

9

drugs or some ether substance which was dangerous tc

10
11

them
The test that the New Jersey Supreme Court

12

develo ped was one which took into consideration the

13

15

studen ts and their rights tc personal privacy.

The emotional trauma which

45

this type of indignity will inflict upon impressionable

adolescents is a cost which society would have to pay

and which should not be ignored in any cost benefit

ana lys is.
QUESTION *

5

What about the costs to the

6

children of other parents to whom this young lady is

7

selling drugs?

8

HS. DE JULIO:

9

QUESTION:

10

Your Honor# the —

That is a social cost of some

importance# isn't it?
MS. DE JULIO:

11

It certainly is, and certainly

12

the question of dealing with drugs and other criminal

13

conduct in the schools has been the subject of many

14

studies which have suggested many remedial measures that

15

could be implemented to attack the problem.

18

that the use of searches is at best a bandaid approach

17

to a problem which I don't think any educator would view

18

as a remedial measure of first choice.

I think

Certainly the

19

drug problem has to be dealt with and should be dealt

20

with.

21
22
23
24
25

The question is whether we have to throw out
students' Fourth Amendment rights in order to do it.
The drug problem in society at large is certainly a
serious one, but we have not permitted the police to
threw away the Fourth Amendment.

46

We have not completely

1

neutralized the Fourth Amendment protections through the

2

exclusionary rule in order to attack the problem of

3

drugs or weapons in our society.

4

The standard which was imposed below was a

5

compromise that recognized that when you are dealing

6

with children you perhaps have more responsibility than

7

when you are dealing with adults, and that may justify

8

the lesser standard that was imposed.

9

Also, the court specifically stated that there

10

were many factors which could be taken into

11

consideration, such as the age of the child, the child's

12

prior involvement in criminal activity or disruptive

13

behavior, the nature of the school's own problems, all

14

of which would be considered by a court in determining

15

whether a reasonable grounds existed for the search to

16

be conducted.

17

It is also important to recognize particularly

18

in the school context that the exclusionary rule dees

19

deter conduct on the part of teachers, that while

20

teachers are not, like the police, directly involved in

21

the criminal justice process, they do have some

22

interest, substantial interest in seeing criminal

23

prosecutions against their students brought to a

24

successful conclusion, because they are responsible for

25

maintaining order in the school.

47

1

And the fact of a juvenile cr criminal

2

conviction would certainly assist the school in dealing

3

with a dangerous or disruptive student.

4

the student entirely from the school ty means of a

5

custodial disposition, or through some lesser sanction

6

might persuade the student to conform his conduct to

7

school norms.

8

9

It might remove

So, I think that teachers would be deterred,
and do have some incentive to follow Fourth Amendment

10

guidelines that would ensure that no evidence would be

11

suppressed in a later court proceeding.

12

I think it is also important to recognize in

13

the school context that the exclusionary rule serves an

14

educative as well as a deterrent function.

15

of evidence is a demonstration to society as a whole and

10

to those who govern us that we value highly our

17

constitutional rights, and we attach serious

18

consequences to those who violate them. If we expect

19

schools to teach students to respect --

20

QUESTION:

You said serious consequences on

21

those who violate them.

22

violated the rights.

The teacher, in your view,

Now, what is the serious

consequence on the teacher?
MS. DE JULIO:

Your Honor, the serious

consequence will be the fact that the subsequent court

48

1

proceeding stemming frcm the illegal evidence that was

2

discovered will be dismissed.

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, in the abstract, the teacher

perhaps couldn’t care less.
MS. DE JULIO:

5

Your Honor, I think in many

6

ways the teacher has more reason, because it is not in

7

the abstract.

8

in the classroom.

The teacher — the student will be back

QUESTION:

9

But the teacher, unlike the

10

policeman, is not involved in a criminal justice project

11

or law enforcement.

12

MS. DE JULIO: But the teacher does have the

13

responsibility of maintaining order and discipline in

14

the school, and if a destructive student or a dangerous

15

student is not dealt with in the criminal justice

16

process, then the school may have to deal with him under

17

much more difficult circumstances.
I think that it is important that we show

18
19

students that the ccnstituticnal system of government is

20

more than a collection of empty promises, and that by

21

applying the exclusionary rule in these circumstances,

22

we protect the students' Fourth Amendment rights and

23

give an effective deterrent for their violation.
QUESTION:

24
25

having

Dc you think that the teacher

suffered this penalty that you describe is

2

studen ts are using marijuana or other drugs?

NS. DE JULIO;

4

QUESTION;

5

I think that the teacher --

What is going to be the impact on

the te acher?
MS. DE JULIO:

6

I think that the impact will be

7

that t he teacher or school authority will learn to

8

confor m their behavior to the reasonable grounds

9

standa rd which

was adopted and which was the basis fcr

10

determ ining whether conduct is proper or improper under

11

the un reasonable search and seizure guarantees.
QUESTION;

12

Then as Justice Powell, I think,

13

sugges ted, teachers had better take a course on the

14

Fourth

Amendment.
MS. DE JULIO;

15

I think that teachers will have

16

to lea rn something about the Fourth Amendment.

17

that t hey already have to learn a great deal about law

18

and ho w law impacts upon them and their role as

19

educat ors. I think this will be a relatively easy lesson

20

t o tea ch, and certainly we are dealing with

21

profes sionals in the area of teaching and learning.

I think

In conclusion, I would merely remind the Court

22
23

that w e opposed the granting of certiorari and continue

24

to opp ose it on the grounds that the decision below was

25

based

upon independent and adequate state grounds.

50

The

1

New Jersey Supreme Court we would argue based its

2

decision upon independent grounds which would not be

3

affected by any modification of the federal law which

4

was cited in the --

5

QUESTION:

May I ask in that connection

6

whether apart from the federal cases, does New Jersey

7

have its own exclusionary rule?
MS. DE JULIO:

8
9

Your Honor, we have a provision

in cur state constitution which, though worded very

10

similarly to the federal provision, has been construed

11

by the New Jersey Supreme Court on many occasions to

12

provide broader protections.

13

QUESTION:

That is not my question.

My

14

question is whether New Jersey has an exclusionary

15

rule.

16

protection of Fourth Amendment.

17

independent exclusionary rule?

18

I know you have argued they have a broader

MS. CE JULIO:

Do they have an

I do not believe that they do,

19

but I do believe that in this case they determined that

20

the exclusionary rule should be applied based on their

21

state law proceedings and on provisions of the state

22

constitution.

ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

1

MR. NODES:

2

REBUTTAL

Yes, Nr. Chief Justice.

Very

3

briefly, in regards to the question that was asked by

4

Justice Powell concerning police training, I believe

5

that the general rule in New Jersey is that an attempt

6

is made to train police officers at least twice a year,

7

and they are given updated training each time a major

8

new constitutional decision comes down which impacts on

9

the Fourth or Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION!

10
11

you knew,

How long has that been going on, if

this kind of police training?
MR. NODES:

12

I am aware of it for about the

13

last five or six years.

15

I am just not aware of it

MR. NODES:

Yes,

19

but the municipal police are included in that program.
After this decision in State in the Interest

20
21

of T.L.C. came down from the New Jersey Supreme Court,

22

there were inquiries from school boards concerning what

23
24
25

they were allowed to dc, and these inquiries have
continued.

I don't believe that many of these inquiries

of trying to find out what the Fourth Amendment means

MR. NODES;

It would later

need for or desire for

That’s correct.

We don’t believe

the exclusionary rule will dc that.
QUESTIONi

If you wanted -- if you only raised

the single question about the exclusionary rule, and if

53

1

you wanted to argue about the Fourth Amendment, you

2

should have come up here with another question.

3

seem to -- You come here on the assumption that there

4

has been a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
ME. NODES;

5

You

Me didn't contest the

6

constitutional violation.

7

contest it because we believe that the Court never

8

needed to reach that, because the exclusionary rule did

9

not automatically have to be applied in any event.
QUESTION;

10

That is correct.

We didn't

Well, part of your argument is that

11

the teachers would like to know what the Fourth

12

Amendment means, because you would expect that they

13

would obey it then.

14

MR. NODES;

15

QUESTION;

Yes, Ycur Honor.
And there wouldn't be the same

16

temptation to disobey it that there is in law

17

enforcement?
MR. NODES;

18
19

I don't know if I understand the

question, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

20

Well, the exclusionary rule rests

21

on, at least a lot of people think so, not everybody, on

22

its deterrent effect, and you must exclude the evidence

23

to deter police conduct that is violative of the — it

24

isn't enough for them to knew what the Fourth Amendment

25

means.

You must also exclude the evidence.

54

HP. NODES;

1

Yes, cr provide another deterrent

2

so you have to teach people — yes, people have to know

3

what the Fourth Amendment says, and then there has to be

4

a deterrent to their violating and doing what they know

5

is wrong.
QUESTION;

6

Well, actually, in New Jersey is it

7

not just the Fourth Amendment, since the protections of

8

the counterpart of the Fourth Amendment in the state

9

constitution apparently broader than we have said they

10

were under the Fourth Amendment.

11

NR. NODES;

12

QUESTION;

13

In many cases -I guess ycur teachers have to know

what the state constitution guarantees are, don’t they?
MR. NODES;

14

I believe under this case that --

15

although in some cases the New Jersey Supreme Court has

16

given

broader protections --
