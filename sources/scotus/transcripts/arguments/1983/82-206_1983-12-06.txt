The granting of that relief is the subject of
the appeal before the Court at this time.
This matter arises out of the following

22

background.

The case was settled in

1980 with the entry

23

of a consent decree which provided hiring and

24

promotional relief consistent with the complaints which

25

were filed in the cause.

The city agreed to a long term

QUESTION i

5

MR. BLAIR;

I take it this was a Title 7 case.
It was, Your Honor.

The complaint

6

was also filed under Section 1981 and Section 1983 of

7

the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The decree also contained what were interim

8
9

goals for hiring and promotions.

No relief was granted

10

with regard to the city's layoff policies or the city's

11

seniority policies, and there was no constructive

12

competitive seniority awarded in the decree, again

13

consistent with the complaints, and the Respodents

14

waived any further relief.
In May of 1981, the City of Memphis, facing a

fiscal

18

and those layoffs were to be conducted consistent with

19

the city's longstanding, city-wide seniority policy

20

which was adopted with regard to layoffs in 1975.

21

Respondents sought injunctive relief in the Federal

22

District Court against the application of the senior

23

policy insofar as it would reduce the percentage of

24

blacks on the fire department.

The District Court, after ruling that the

issue before the court was not whether the city could

lay off, but the manner in which the city would lay off,

directed the city to come up with a plan consistent with

5

the court’s ruling.

The court

That court's order caused three innocent,

6

incumbent, white firefighters to be laid off who would

8

not have been laid off had the seniority policy been

9

applied.

It also caused seven additional senior,

11

off from their position or, in the parlance of the shop,

bumped down.

2

interpretation, of the decree or a motion to modify it?
MR. BLAIR;

3

Justice Eehnquist, in terms of the

4

ultimate resuit/ I don't think it makes any difference.

5

It is cur position that it was not an interpretaticn,

6

that the relief was not provided in the decree at all,

7

and that if the Court then wants to take the next step

8

and analyze whether modification would have been proper

9

under

these circumstaces, then we respectfully submit

10

that modification was not proper because the proper

11

circumstances were not present in this case.

12

I hope that answers your question.

QUESTION;

Mr. Blair/ may I ask, have any cf

these white firefighters been reinstated?

Everyone is back to the position which they held when

the layoffs took place.

QUESTION:

16

Yes, I did want to ask about the

specific consequences because I was wondering if, as you

answered in response to Justice Brennan, the collective

20

source of the city's legal obligation to pay the back

MR. 3LAIR;

14

regardless of who wins the

Sell, if Your Honor please, it

15

certainly would be our contention on behalf of the union

16

that if they have a rule and regulation that is in

17

effect and an obligation arises out of the enforcement

18

of that rule and regulation, that an employer could not

19

at that point at its whim say, well, that's not our rule

20

and regulation anymore, after the fact, and thereby in

21

effect erase the obligation or do away with the

22

obiiga tion.
It certainly is true that management has a lot

23
24

of normal management prerogatives which it can change

25

during

the course of the employment relationship, but if
13

there is an obligation that arises out of an area

covered by or a rule or regulation which arises out of

an area that is covered by normal management

obligation by simply saying, well, we are going to

HR. BLAIR;

2

Kell, if Your Honor please, as I

3

think this court recognized in California Brewers, every

4

seniority system is going to have aspects of that system

5

which are not based on the length of employment.
What you have here is a facially neutral,

6
7

nondiscriminatory, alphabetical tie-breaker designed to

8

apply in just this situation, and the source was that

9

the city was trying to find a fair way to establish or

create a tie-breaker.

The City of Memphis is

alreaiy taxing at the maximum level at which it can tax

4

We can ’t raise the sales tax again.
As regards our property tax, there was a

one-time decrease when the last sales tax increase came

7

into effect, but we are really, from a practical

8

standpoint, at the peak of the property tax at this

We have a rather odd situation where

industrial and commercial property in Tennessee is

AS AMICUS CURIAE

17

MR. LEE:

18
19

20

Hr. Solicitor General?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The issue in this case is squarely controlled

21

by this Court's holding in Teamsters v. United States

22

that federal courts lack the power to grant

23

constructive, competitive seniority to nonvictims of

24

employment discrimination,

25

shown that they individually are persons against whom

that is, these who have net

1

discrimination was practiced.

2

In Teamsters, the District Court found that

3

the employer had engaged in a pattern and practice of

4

discrimination against blacks and Spanish-surnamed

5

Americans, and in order to remedy this discrimination,

6

the Court of Appeals awarded constructive, retroactive

7

seniority tc each member of the class.
The previous term, in Franks v. Bowman

8

Transportation Company, the Court had held that proven

10

individual victims were entitled to be slotted into

11

their rightful place in the seniority system, that is,

12

the place that they would have enjoyed tut for the

13

di serimina tion.

14

Under Franks, therefore, both the

15

disriminatees and also their innocent ccworkers whose

16

rights are necessarily affected by the grant of

17

constructive competitive seniority, are relegated tc the

18

respective positions that they would have enjoyed

14

and indeed, it

Given the importance of seniority systems to

18

Title 7, it would make no sense at all , we submit, tc

19

ignore seniority in the single contect where it really

20

matters, particularly when you consider that beginning

21

with Franks in 1976, this Court has been called upon

22

with some frequency and in various contexts to reach an

23

accommodation between the achievement cn the one hand of

24

the twin objectives of Title 7, which is to eliminate

25

discrimination and compensate its victims, and on the

other hand, the protection cf bona fide seniority

2

systems.
There are about a half a dozen such cases that

3
4

deal with that accommodation, and the opinions are

5

characterized by two persistent themes.

6

these themes focuses on who are the beneficiaries cf

7

Title 7 remedial orders, and draws a bright line

The first of

The second theme concerns the other half of

From one perspective, Franks itself, which

20

dees grant competitive seniority to actual victims,

21

imposes part of the cost on innocent coworkers, but at

22

least under Franks, the cost distribution among the

23

victims and the innocent coworkers is the same

24

distribution that would have occurred if there had been

25

no discrimination.

It simply puts the relative parties

To go beyond that and to require that

to go beyond the limits of federal judicial power, and
