ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,

7

ON EEHAIF OF THE PETITIONEE

8

MR. LEEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9

the Court, before I state the facts of this case, I

10

would like first just briefly briefly to review the

11

governing principle of law against whose background the

12

statement of facts should be mere helpful.

13

The exclusionary rule emerged from cases like

14

Weeks versus the United States and Mapp v. Ohio in which

15

law enforcement officers committed flagrantly abusive

16

violations of the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.

17

The officers knew or should have known that what they

18

were doing was a violation of the Fourth Amendment tut

19

they did it anyway.
The rule rests on the assumption that the best

20
21

way to deter that kind of conduct is to deny its

22

evidentiary fruits to the law enforcement officers who

23

perpetrated it.

24

underyling deterrence assumption is being challenged in

25

this case.

Neither the exclusionary rule nor its

Its applicability to cases of wilful

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

misconduct, like Weeks and Pape, would be left

2

undisturbed by the rule which we propose.

3

The net result of Weeks and *app is that we

4

are willing to let seme criminals gc free as the

5

necessary price for deterring the constable from

6

violating the Fourth Amendment, but it is a heavy price,

7

and this Court has clarified that it is a heavy price,

8

and that we do not pay it beyond those cases to which

9

its underlying deterrence rationale extends.
The exception for which we contend comes into

10
11

play by its very definition only in those cases where

12

deterrence would be inappropriate, where the police have

13

acted as a reasonably well trained officer would have

14

acted

15

whatever extent, excluding the evidence, where the

16

police have acted reasonably deters,

17

It cverdeters.

under the circumstances.

In that kind of case, tc

it deters too much.

It is just as likely to deter the police from

18
19

performing their duty as it is tc encourage compliance

20

with the Fourth Amendment.
Therefore, it will not deter future Fourth

21
22

Amendment violations sc long as the police do their

23

duty.

24
25

This Court’s precedents make it very clear
that since the paramount and perhaps the sole purpose of

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the exclusionary rule is to deter, the rule applies only

2

to those situations where the deterrence benefits

3

outweigh the costs of depressing highly probative

4

eviden ce.

5

In Stone v. Fowell and United States v. Janis,

6

for example, it was conceded that there would have been

7

some additional evidence, seme additional deterrence

8

from the unavailability of the illegally seized evidence

9

at a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding or a civil

10
11

trial by a different sovereign.
In both of those cases and others, the

12

existence of seme marginal deterrence from application

13

of the exclusionary rule to these additional proceedings

14

or to those additional contexts was conceded.

15

Nevertheless, the rule was held inapplicable because it

16

could not pay its way in a cost benefit analysis.

17

marginal evidentiary ccst exceeded the marginal

18

deterrence benefit that would result from applying an

19

exclusionary rule to these proceedings.

The

20

And it is this Court's deterrence-based ccst

21

benefit principle which squarely governs this case, to

22

whose facts I now turn.

23

On the ccst side, the four respondents here

24

have been charged with offenses that include the

25

possession and distribution of drugs.

The evidence that

5

1

they seek to exclude, large quantities cf drugs and drug

2

dealing paraphernalia found in their residences, is

3

highly relevant to the issue of their guilt or

4

innoce nee.

5

On the deterrence side, it is really quite

6

difficult to perceive just what it is that the police

7

did wrong in this case, or perhaps more appropriately

8

said,

9

differently in the next case.

what it is that we would want them to do

10

After receiving a tip from an informant that -

11

QUESTION*

Well, on that basis -- perhaps we

12

just ought tc reverse cn that basis, that they acted

13

consistently with the Fourth Amendment.

That brings into play. Justice

HE. LEE*

Another Illinois against Gates.
Another Illinois against Gates, and

18

cf course my response tc that is twofold.

The first is

19

that the question is net before the Court in the sense

20

that it is net one cf the questions presented, and the

21

second is that after Gates, it involves nothing more

22

than a fact bound probable cause issue which does net —

23

which

on the merits.

QUESTIONj

Sc you assume that we wanted tc do

something else.

4

MB. LEE;

Exactly, and I will also assure you

5

that if you are interested in reviewing fact bound

6

probable cause cases from the Ninth Circuit, we can

7

bring many more of them here.

8

(General laughter.)

9

MR. LEE;

10

QUESTION;

But —
Kay I ask, though, along the same

11

vein,

12

case exactly as you urge the Court to do, and a

13

magistrate in the future is confronted with an identical

14

fact pattern.

15

or not ?

16

Mr. Solicitor General, supposing we decide this

Should the magistrate issue the warrant

ME. LEE;

Whether the magistrate should issue

17

the warrant or not depends on factors other than what

18

the Court would give in deciding this particular case,

19

because the relevant decision in guiding the magistrate

20

whether to issue the warrant or not would be Illinois

21

versus Gates, and not this case.

22

QUESTION;

Well, but if this case is -- assume

23

an exact duplicate of the facts of this case,

which are

24

quite different from Illinois against Gates.

He must

25

either decide that dees constitute probable cause cr

MR. LEE;

3

QUESTION;

That is correct.
And we don’t reach the good faith

4

rule unless we first decide, it seems to me, that there

5

is no probable cause.

6

MR. LEE;

Well, in our view, those are two

7

completely separate issues. • The one gees to the wrong,

8

and the other goes to the remedy.

The one goes to the

question, has there or has there not been a substantive
10

Fourth Amendment violation, and the other goes to the

11

question whether, assuminc that there is a Fourth

12

Amendment violation, what should be the remedy.

13

the evidence or should it not be excluded?
The Illinois versus Gates went to one, and

14
15
18

Should

United

States versus Leon should oo to the other.
QUESTION;

Well, you haven't challenged here

17

the Ninth Circuit's determination that there was a

18

violation of the Fourth Amendment.

1

you present in your petition is the good faith rule.

20

Isn't that right?

21

MR. LEE;

The only question

That is exactly right, and -- that

22

is exactly right.

23

the Court, and of course, while the Court --

24
25

QUESTION;

It is the only issue that is before

is, you are really not quite sure what the magistrate

should do

MR. LEE*

Well, and that that is not an issue

3

-- We deliberately have not briefed it.

4

reached it.

5

We urge the Court not to reach it.

QUESTION*

Well, you know what magistrates in

And in other circuits, if the rule

was different, they would net issue the warrant.

Precisely.

And if that is a serious

18

QUESTION*

General Lee, I guess this case was

decided before Illinois versus Gates?

19

MR. LEE*

20

QUESTION*

That is correct.
And does the record in this case

21

establish that the pelice actually had information

22

available about the reliability and credibility of the

23

informer?

24

according to the record?

25

Was that information available tc them,

MR. LEE:

We have characterized this informant

1

under the usual standards as ar informant cf unprc-ver

2

reliability, the same as in Illinois versus Gates.

3

After receiving a tir from an informant that

4

two of the respondents were selling drugs in large

5

quantities. Officer Cyril Faumbach and other officers of

6

the Burbank Police Eepartment conducted a mcnth-lcrg

7

investigation of two residences and a condominium,

8

observed activities generally consistent with the

9

informant’s information, and conducted background checks

10
11

on persons whom they observed.
Pased on that information, on his years cf

12

experience as a narcotics officer, and on his

13

specialized training in narcotics investigations,

14

Officer Faumbach concluded

15

being used as a distribution point, referred to as a

16

stash pad, tc store large quantities cf narcotics which

17

were then transported in smaller amounts to respondents’

18

residences for distribution.

that the condominium was

After consulting with three ether experienced

20

investigators and three deputy district attorneys, he

21

applied for a search warrant, which was issued by a

22

California Superior Court judge.

23

New, as I say, whether the magistrate's

24

judgment in this case correctly assessed the presence of

25

probable cause is not before the Court, but whether the

protable cause, it certainly cculd not he said that it

should have teen clear to Officer Raumtach that there

4

was no probable cause cr that applying for a warrant

5

would be improper in the circuinstances .

6

He prepared his affidavit, and presented it tc

7

a magistrate, sc that the decision whether to search or

8

not to search was made as this Court has stated so

9

frequently that it should be made, by a judicial

10

officer, in this case a judge, rather than an executive

11

officer.

12

I would invite the Court’s attention tc

13

Officer Raumbach’s detailed, carefully prepared

14

affidavit, Rages 3b tc 52 cf the Joint Appendix, which

15

shows that the constable in this case was a cautious,

highly trained, and experienced narcotics expert who

been suggested, an objective, reasonable good faith

23

exception, an exception which is keyed to the reasonably

24

well trained officer, would place a premium on

25

reasonableness and on training.

Far from placing a premium on ignorance, as has

QUESTION;
action

3

What does it do tc encourage proper

by the magistrate?
MB. I EE:

let me turn to that.

Very little.

4

And the reason is that whatever problem you have,

5

Justice O'Connor, at the magistrate level is a problem

6

that is simply outside the ambit cf what the

7

exclusionary rule was ever intended to accomplish and

8

what it is by its very nature capable cf accomplishing.

9

Magistrates are judicial officers.

They are

10

members cf, if you will, the Article III branch, the

11

judicial branch.

12

today,

In bcth the cases before the Court

they were judges, and the way --

13

QUESTION:

14

MB. LEE:

15

QUESTION;

If I may interrupt -Yes.
-- I assume that is usually the

16

case.

In the City of Tampa case ten years ago, we said

17

it was all right fcr a city clerk to be a magistrate.
MR. LEE;

18

That is correct.

Put even there,

19

the Court clarified that there are two requirements that

20

magistrates must meet.

21

neutral and unbiased, and the ether is that they have tc

22

be capable of making the probable cause judgement.

23

as long as those two requirements are met, those are the

24

two requirements that are essential to the magistrate's

25

job .

One of them is that they must be

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 6284300

Now,

1

But regardless of the level cf the training,

2

as long as they are neutral and detached, and as leng as

3

they are capable of making the probable cause judgment,

4

they are judges.

5

And the way our system —

7

They are part of the judicial branch.

QUESTION:
General —

8

NR. LEE:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Kaybe.it is enough, Hr. Solicitor

Excuse me.
-- to say they are performing a

judicial function in that particular setting.
HR. LEE:

That is absolutely right.

That is

12

absolutely right.

13

the way that our system corrects their past errors and

14

prevents their future errors is to reverse their

15

decisions on appeal.

16

They are performing as judges.

And

New, I recognize that it has been suggested by

17

the respondents and the amici that reversal cf

18

magistrate decisions is not an adequate corrective,

19

however adequate it is cr it is not to upgrade the

20

quality cf magistrates, it is certainly mere closely

21

linked to the magistrate function than is the exclusion

22

cf evidence, which impeses the remedy and its burden on

23

another branch of government and on society as a whole.

24
25

If the purpose of changing the exclusionary

rule is to admit the evidence, I fail to see hew ycu
would ever have occasion to determine the propriety of
the magistrate's action.
MS. LEE;

Well, on the later occasion when the

evidence either is or is net admitted, then the decision
of the magistrate would be reviewed in the normal ccurse
of events, but it is net simply a matter, we submit, of
excluding the evidence.
QUESTION;

But the issue before us now is the

conduct of the — net cf the judicial officer, but of
the police officer in acting in good faith on a

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. lee, cne of the arguments

17

your opponents make to the adoption of a good faith

18

exception tc the exclusion rule is that it wculd prevent

19

the development of Fourth Amendment law because the

20

typical judge at a suppression hearinq, faced with the

21

question of, was there a Fourth Amendment violation, was

22

it in good faith and reasonable, is ocing to answer the

23

question, it was in good faith and reasonable, and sc we

24

don’t have tc get to the — Now, if you don’t feel there

much,

4

your idea that magistrates* findings are somehow

6

I guess, what your answer is.

8

tut it seems tc ire that it dees kind cf qc against

MS. LEEi

Well, leave the magistrates aside,

because I am really a tit uncertain as to what extent
those would be reviewable or not, but the — or in

10

exactly what context, tut taking the issue that you have

11

now raised, which is whether the adoption of a

12

reasonable belief exception would freeze the develcpnent

13

of the Fourth Amendment law, I think it is a legitimate

14

concern, and one that ought to he faced.

16

On its face, however, I would note that it has

16

to te taken in perspective, given the Court's consistent

17

caution against the unnecessary resolution cf

18

constitutional issues, and that if the rule is otherwise

1

appropriate for adoption, that certainly it is not a

20

persuasive reason not tc adept it, because the

21

consequence would be that this Court would have fewer

22

opportunities tc decide constitutional questions.

23

But to whatever extent it is a legitimate

24

concern, and I start from the premise that it is, there

25

are several avenues by which substantive Fourth

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Amendment issues will continue to come before this

Court.

reply brief, and in the interest of time I will simply

4

refer you to those categories that are discussed in our

brief.

Three of these categories are discussed in cur

17

circum stances.

prudential use cf the Court’s resources, and that

In the harmless error cases, for example, the

19

Court has sometimes considered first whether a wrong was

20

committed, and sometimes it has not.

21

error cases are discussed in cur opening brief, both

22

cases coming out of this Court and also out cf the

23

Courts of Appeals, and

24

25

persuasiveness of those harmless error cases.

1

And in O’Connor versus Donaldson, which was a

2

civil damage suit, the Court first held that the

3

respondent's confinement was unconstitutional, and then

4

remanded the case to the Court of Appeals to consider

5

the petitioner’s claim cf a good faith immunity defense

6

in light of the intervening decision handed down the

7

same term in Wood versus Strickland.

8

New, if there were an Article III

9

constitutional limitation on reaching the substantive

10

issue in a case in which the remedial issue might

11

dispose cf the case, you would have to overrule both the

12

harmless error cases and also Wood versus Strickland.
The question therefore concerns the

13
14

requirements of judicial prudence and not of Article

to tack down from the rule which is attempting to

13

function vis-a-vis the Pill of Eights and the

20

Constitution, so that they will not feel, as studies

seem to indicate, disassociated from the rest of us when

It therefore becomes incumbent upon the Court not

Now, implicit in the government's position is

that alternative remedies can effectuate the same thing

that the exclusionary rule can do by -- and there are

implies that there are equal remedies that would

effectuate the same things that we want the exclusionary

In fact, that isn't true.

Mr. Cossack, if the thrust of the

magistrate simply makes some kind of a mistake or error,

13

a slip of the pen?

ME. COSSACK;

15

QUESTION;

Are you suggesting that --

Is there no room there for any kind

16

of a so-called good faith exception for the officer

17

executing such a warrant?

18

MR. COSSACK;

Are you suggesting a situation,

19

Your Honor, where there was probable cause in fact, the

20

magistrate reviewed it, and decided there wasn't

21

probable cause?

22

QUESTION;

Or maybe even decided there was and

23

made some error on the warrant.

24

there is no room for any good faith exception?

MR. COSSACK;

Are you suggesting that

So that —

NR. COSSACK;

11

Are you suggesting, Your Honor,

12

that the magistrate acted erroneously on an incorrect

13

warrant and came tc the conclusion that there was

14

probable cause when in fact the police officer in geed

15

16

misstated facts?
Well, I believe. Your Honor, that in those

17

kinds of situations, the courts have held that upon

18

review of the ex parte proceeding, that both sides would

19

be allowed to bring cut that fact, and the true facts

20

would then be presented to

QUESTION :

Well, apart from the integrity

point,

4

at least that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to

deter unlawful police conduct.

I think this Court has said a half a dozen times

6

MR. COSSACKi

7

QUESTION*

8

That’s correct. Your Honor.

Have we ever said the purpose was

tc deter unlawful conduct ty the magistrate?

9

MR. COSSACKi

No, Your Honor, but I don’t

10

think you have ever had presented tc this Court a

11

situation where the government is attempting to say that

12

because a magistrate erred and not a police erred, there

13

is — somehow that the rights of the individual are

14

somewhat less affected as they are today.

Yes, Your Honor.

Right.

I will ask you one other

19

question.

Do you think deterrence is an appropriate

20

remedy for a magistrate who is removed, at least it

21

seems tc me, from the same sort of atmosphere that a

22

police officer — in which the police officer acts?

23

is a judicial officer.

24

25

conduct, would apply equally to a magistrate as to a

police officer?
MR.

COSSACK:

Your Honor, I believe that the

3

way I can answer that question is that, is that it

4

should, because the net effect cf it is that somewhere

5

an individual's rights guaranteed as probable cause are

6

being affected, and therefore it is imperative upon us

7

to recognize those rights, whether they are hurt by

8

improper police conduct or improper magistrate conduct.

14

MR. LEE:

15
16

It should net take that long, hr.

Chief Justice.
First, with respect to magistrate shopping,

17

the argument is nothing more nor less than an attack on

18

the warrant procedure itself and on this Court’s

19

consistent advice that it has given over the years that

20

the decision of whether to search or not after the

21

police have done their job should net be dene by the

22

police preferably, but it should be a decision that

23

should be made by a neutral judicial officer.

24
25

Nothing has happened in the interim to change
the propriety or the correctness of that advice.
