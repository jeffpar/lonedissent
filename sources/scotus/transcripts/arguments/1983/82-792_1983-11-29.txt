ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MS. LASCELLt

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and fna y it please the Courti
At issue in this case is whether a private

13

college called Grove City College which seeks to avoid

14

government entanglement, which seeks to remain

15

independent, and which seeks to operate efficiently,

16

must either expel students who receive federal

17

scholarships, or must agree that it is subject to

18

government regulation.

19

Grove City has never sought nor accepted any

20

federal aid nor grants.

21

participate in the BEOG program or any other student

22

assistance program sponsored by state or federal

23

governments.

QUESTION*.

5

MR. LASCELLi

6

Yes.
But in terms of the statement of

the case, that is the position of the college.

7

OUESTIONi

8

HR. IASCEILt

9

That's correct, Hr. Justice

All right, that's the position.
The government acknowledged, as

a matter of fact, that Grove City was not participating

10

in the BEOG program, but it asked the college tc help by

11

supplying forms for students who might be eligible to

12

participater in the BEOG program and by certifyina

13

attendance and costs at the college in order that those

14

students might receive those awards.

15

The government now claims that what Grove City

16

did means that the college is operating a program which

17

receives federal financial assistance.

18

claim in this case, nor has there ever been any claim,

19

that Grove City discriminates in any way, nor that it

20

claims any right tc discriminate.

21

There is no

Now, the issues in the case can be a little

22

confusing, and we have tried tc label them for the

23

convenience of the Court in three ways.

24

what we call the recipicient issue, that is, whether

25

Grove City operates a program which receives federal

financial assistance because seme of its students

2

receive BEOG grants.

3
4

QUESTION:

They use the money to pay their

tuition?
KR. LASCELLi

5

Perhaps, but certainly not,

6

not — that is a theoretical possibility, Justice White,

7

but I don't think in this case, in fact, that is what

8

happened, nor do I think that that is what could

9

happen .

10

11
12

In this case the government selects the
students, the Court will recall -QUESTION:

But you would be here making the

13

same argument if, even if the students were just

14

conduits through which tuition money passed.

15

MB. LASCELL:

Well, I would be making the same

16

arguments, but in fact, it seems to me that the BFOG

17

grant statute does not contemplate that the students are

18

conduits but instead contemplates that they are ultimate

19

beneficiaries.

20
21

QUESTION:

That they could use the money for

anything they wanted to.

Sight.

3

MP. LASCELL:

But. in this instance, the two

4

students who are involved in this case in fact did not

5

use that money for tuition.

6

neither student received that money until well after

7

tuition and fee payments were due at the college, and in

8

fact,

9

evident that that money cannot come to those students

Ycu will recall that

if we closely examine the BECG program, it is very

10

until after they are in attendance for the semester

11

which

12

does not occur until after students begin classes.

13

Under those circumstances, at Grove City, at least, the

14

money whicn the students receive would not qo to the

15

institution but would be used for other educational

16

purposes, whether tc repay loans, to take care of

17

housing, to buy books at off-campus stores, other

18

educational purposes allowed by the statute and the

19

regula tions.

20

21

recipient issue.

And in this instance, the

That is the first issue, the

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Grove City claims that it is not a recipient,

1

2

and if

the Court agrees, it does not need to consider

3

what we have called issues two and three.

4

Issue two is the program issue.

What is the

5

program or activity to be regulated if in fact Grove

6

City is a recipient.?
Three theories have been offered to this

7

8

Court.

One is that the program equals the institution,

9

institutionwide program at Grove City or any other

10

college.

That's the government's historical position,

11

and it is the position which was adopted by the Third

12

Circui t.
The second position, the second theory offered

13
14

to this Court is the one that Grove City offers,

that if

15

Grove City is a recipient, the program appropriately to

16

be regulated is the BECG program itself.
The third theory is a new one which has been

17
18

offered to this court, and that is that the entire

19

financial aid program of a college like Grove City is

20

that which is to be regulated, including any private

21

money

22

That's the government's new position, offered for the

23

first time to this Court and never before offered to the

24

college.

25

the program issue.

which is a part cf that financial aid program.

That is the program issue, what we have called

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

The thir.l issue, which again needs to be

1

2

considered only if Grove City is determined to be a

3

recipient, is what we have called the funds termination

4

issues

5

terminated solely because Grove City refused to execute

6

an assurance of compliance which the government itself

7

now says was overly broad when it asked Grove City to

8

execute it, but which the government also says now can

9

be saved by a new interpretation never before offered to

whether aid to Grove City students can be

10

the college and despite the fact that there has never

11

been any claim of discrimination levied against this

12

instit ution .
Those, therefore, are the three issues which

13
14

we seek to address, the recipient issue, the program

15

issue,

16

and the funds termination issue.
Turning first to the recipient issue, whether

17

or not Grove City is a recipient of federal financial

18

assistance depends obviously, as this Court well knows,

19

on the language of the statute itself.

20

about receiving federal financial assistance and

21

operating a program or activity.

22

the college that receive has plain meaning.

23

word which any one cf us would have difficulty in

24

understanding were we not lawyers arguing about a case.

25

couintry, receive means to consciously participate, and

2

to receive, to obtain funds.

3

that.

Grove City does not do

4

In fact, it consciously has chosen not to

5

participate in any federal aid program of any kind,

6

despite the fact that those —
QUESTIONS

7

Well, you can certainly -- a

8

legatee can certainly receive funds from a testator

9

without having consciously participated at all, and the

10

testator — I don’t see why you put consciously

11

participate into your definition of receive.
MR. LASCELLs

12

Only here, Justice, because I

13

think that the arant program contemplates seme

14

deliberate action on the part of the college.

15

disagree that a legatee could receive something without

16

doing anything except being there.

17

instance, I think that the scope of the grant statute

18

itself contemplates some activity.
QUESTION;

19

I don’t

But in this

Then you are not talking about the

20

generic meaning of the word

21

about the word "receive” as it appears in the statute.
HR. IASCELL;

22
23
24
25

"receive."

That’s correct.

You are talking

That’s

correc t.
QUESTION;

Is there any federal statute that

the college would be violating if it announced and

g

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

enforced a policy of refusing to accept any student who

2

received federal aid?
ME. IASCEILs

3
4

None of which I am aware.

I do

not —
Wouldn't that be a discrimination?

5

QUESTIONS

6

MR. IASCEILs

Well, I don't think that it's a

7

discrimination, though, for any protected class.

I

8

think that the college could say we choose to accept

9

only those students who take no federal aid programs.
The difficulty with that, Mr. Chief Justice,

10
11

is that of the college does that, what it would be doing

12

would be to discriminate in one way, maybe not in a

13

protected way, but discriminato in one way against those

14

students who in fact the Congress chose to help by these

15

aid programs, and certainly in

16

students might Include minorities, particularly poor

17

minorities who would be unable to attend a college like

18

Grove City even — I'm sorry, without these kinds of lid

19

progra ms.

20

this instance, those

That seems anomalous to us because the

21

Congress clearly intended with these aid programs to aid

22

such students.

23

QUESTION

i

Does the record give us any

24

breakdown on the composition of the students receiving

25

this particular form of aid at Grove City?

record

3

O'Conner, co-educational since its founding, as the

4

Court knows.

5

about its 200 — 2200 students, received BEOG awards

6

under this alternate disbursal system.

7

however, nothing in the record which indicates the

8

proportion by which those students were divided, whether

9

by sex, by minority, by race, by religion, by anything

10

11

about that.

There is very little in the

At the time that this case arose,

There is,

Don't forget that that — the reason for that

12

is that the government chooses those students; Grove

13

City dees net.

14

were there are allows them to attend once they have

15

received those awards.

16

Grove City simply takes the students who

The other important point, T think, about

17

Grove City which we should say and which should be clear

18

and which is a part of the record is that its efficiency

19

and operation has resulted in very high quality

20

educational programs at very low cost.

21

room and board costs at the time that this case arose

22

were just over $4000 per year, not per semester as all

23

of us are accustomed to seeing at high quality private,

24

independent universities and colleges in this country.

25

One of the reasons that it has been able to do that has

Its tuition fee,

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

been because cf its refusal to be entangled with any

2

kind of government authority, and at the same time, its

3

refusal as a part of its conscience and heritage, to

4

discriminate against any class of people who wish to

5

attend

that institution.
That is something of which the college is very

6
7

proud,

and rightfully so, it seems to me.
Now, the recipient issue is one which we find

8
9

very difficult.

The Court will recall that at the time

10

Title 9 was enacted, there were in fact three pieces of

11

legislation before the Congress, one a proposal from

12

Senator Bayh, one a proposal from Congresswoman Greene,

13

and one, an administrative proposal, and the Congress

14

made a conscious choice about which of those proposals

15

it chose to accept.
The position of the college is that the

16
17

proposal which it chose to accept is one which includes

18

a definition of receive which does not emcompass this

19

college operating in this way.

20

in that statute receive or benefit or assist.

kind of assistance.
ME. LASCELL:

QUESTION:

4
5

We agree entirely. Justice

And North Haven v. Bell of this

Court indicated we give it a broad reading.
So how do you explain that?

6

And there are

7

references in the legislative record that discuss the

8

intent of the drafters of that legislation.
MR. LASCELL:

9

I agree entirely.

Title 9 was a part of the Education Act's —

10
11

Education Act of 1972.

There were 20 parts tc that

12

act.

13

grants, as continuing education programs, establishment

14

of a National Institute of Educator, and among the ether

15

17 which were remaining, both Title 9 and the federal

16

financial assistance program about which we are

17

talkin g.

Those parts included such things as library

Now, the BEOG program was just one small part

18
19

of that federal financial assistance program.

20

were, as the Court will recall, several other parts to

21

that.
The statutory language, the college would

22
23

agree,

24

under the circumstances.

25

There

should be given as broad a scope as possible

QUESTION:

It is remedial legislation.

Well, do you think then that — all

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

right.

Do you think that the receipt cannot he

indire ct?

3

MR. LASCELLs

4

QUESTIONj

5

MR. IASCELLi

6

Do you think it has to he direct?
I believe that that was the

choice which the Congress made.
QUESTION*

7

8

Yes.

Senator Humphreys*

Well, how do you account for
statements to the contrary?

MR. LASCELL:

9

Well, I think that Senator

10

Humphrey's statements related to Title 6, and I think

11

that they also related later to the proposal which

12

Senator Bayh made in 1971, and the Court will recall

13

that between 1971 and 1972 when the legislation was

14

enacted, there was a dramatic change in what was

15

proposed as Title 9.
The *71 version, for instance, applied only to

16
17

public schools and to private graduate programs, and we

18

know that in the '17 version which was eventually

19

enacted, both those circumstances were eliminated in

20

1972.

21

the administration proposal, and the proposal from

22

Representative Greene, were different than that which

23

Senator Bayh had proposed in 1971.

We also know that the administrative proposal,

We read that legislative history as very

24
25

confusing.

It was interesting to me as I reread the

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

briefs this weekend, to see that every one of us,

fcc th

2

amici -- every amici and every litigant, cited that

3

legislative history from Senator Bayh as supportive of

4

our own positions.
Now, that means tc me, Justice O'Connor, that

5
6

really the only thing that we can examine which shows

7

any clear change or distinction is the differences, or

8

are the differences between the '71 legislation and the

9

'72 legislation which was enacted.

And it is the

10

college's position that in that change it became as

11

clear as we can hope that recipient under these

12

circumstances did not mean beneficiary or did not

13

mean — did not mean benefit or did not mean

14

a ssist ance.
We do not believe, by the way, that that

15
16

interpretation of the statute means that discrimination

17

will affect American higher education in ways that would

18

be entirely improper, nor dc we believe that that means

19

the end of Title 9 enforcement.

20

that that's correct.

21

Haven the Finch reading of infection, it has done so

22

before, and that is the position with which this college

23

a g r ee s .

24
25

We simply dc not think

This Court acknowledged in Forth

This college does not discriminate and dees
not think that other colleges should, and thinks that if

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

a program is infected by discriminatory practices, then

2

the assistance to the federally funded program can and

3

should be terminated.

4

advocate for the remainder of the life of this college.
QUESTIONS

5

That is a position which we will

Counsel, if the government prevails

6

here, what will be in your view the effect upon women’s

7

colleges that are still women's colleges, like Wilson

8

and tft . Holyoke, and others?
KB. LASCELL;

9

And Wells, Your Honor.

I say that dear to my heart.

10

I chair the

11

board

12

about which I have some great personal concern.

13

of a women’s college so that this is an argument

I think if the government prevails here in

14

this case, that the effect — that there will be no

15

effect on women’s undergraduate institutions.

16

will of course recall that Title 9 exempts that.

17

Private, single-sex institutions are exempt from the

18

enforcement provisions of Title 9 currently, and I

19

believe as well that with a narrow reading of this

20

Court's decision in the Mississippi College case, that

21

that can continue, so that I don't see that" that will be

22

a problem here.

23

The Court

What I think is important, and what I think

24

Congress did when it enacted Title 9, was to balance twc

25

very important concerns, exceptionally important; one,

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

to prevent gender discrimination in post-secondary

2

education in the United States* and at the same time, by

3

very carefully constructing that Education Act of

4

by attempting to preserve diversity in American higher

5

educat ion.

6

1972,

Net everyone, Justice Blackmun, would think

7

that a single-sex college is appropriate.

Not everyone

8

would think that what Grove City believes is

9

appropriate.

But the significance of those events, the

10

significance of that diversity in American higher

11

education I believe is what Congress carefully chose to

12

do as it balanced those interests in 1972.

13

The second issue, of course, if

the Court

14

determines that Grove City is a recipient, is the

15

prearam specificity issue.

16
17

QUESTION;

May I ask one question before you

leave this?

18

MB. LASCELL;

19

QUESTION;

Yes, Justice Stevens.

You take the position the

20

regulation is invalid?

21

MR. LASCELL:

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. LASCELL;

Yes, I do, as it is applied.

Eight.
The second issue is the program

24

specificity issue.

There are, as I mentioned in the

25

beginning, three theories which have been propounded to

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the Court, one, that the program equals the institution;

2

second, that the program is the EEOG program itself; and

3

third,

4

financial aid program,

5

program which is to be regulated if Grove City is a

6

recipi ent.

7

the new government position that the entire
including private money, is the

The program, so far as we can tell from our

8

examination of Title 9 and from the contemporaneous

9

history and from the statements of the commentators, the

10

program is defined and limited by the purpose of the

11

underlying grant statute.

12

is to be regulated.

13

that if we examine the funds termination provision.

14

That is what determines what

And I think that we find support in

The Court will recall that the funds

15

regula ted ?

9

MR. LASCELL;

That if the cclleae, Justice --

10

I’m sorry, if the Court determines that Grove City

11

College is a recipient of federal financial

12

assistance --

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. LASCELLs

15

I get it now.
Then the program which is

appropriately regulated is only the BEOG program.

16

QUESTION;

And therefore?

17

MR. LASCELL;

And therefore that the

18

regulations and the enforcement of the regulations which

19

the government propounds which says that that entire

20

college is to be regulated, is incorrect.

21

QUESTION;

Well, you would say, though, that

22

the college could be forced to, if we get this far,

23

the college could be forced to execute some kind of a

24

piece of paper —

25

MR. LASCELL;

I would say that --

QUESTION'S

With respect to that proigram.

2

MR. LASCELL:

That's correct.

If there vera a

3

program specific assurance of compliance correctly

4

drafted, which we say that the one involved in this case

5

is not, then the college could be required to execute

6

that with respect to its operation —
QUESTIONS

7

8

Well, the government seems tc think

that its request was overbroad in the first place.
MR. LASCELLs

9

I think that's correct.

That's

10

the first time, of course, that that has been said as we

11

came through the Third Circuit —
QUESTIONS

12

But they -- but they still insist

13

on something broader than you think is necessary, even

14

if you are a recipient.
MR. LASCELLs

15
16

I think that's exactly correct,

exactly correct.
The third issue is the funds termination

17
18

issue.

The claim of the government is that it can

19

terminate the funis of these students even though Grove

20

City doesn't discriminate and even though there is this

21

overly admittedly broad, or admittedly overly broad

22

assurance of compliance.
The position of the college is that that is

23
24

fundamentally unfair to the beneficiaries of this grant

25

statute.

There has never been a claim of discrimination

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

There is an admittedly overly fcroad assurance of

here

2

compliance, and yet the government still claims a right

3

to terminate this assistance.

4

QUESTIONS

Well,

what if — what if you're a

5

recipient, and what if

6

and you then refuse to executel the proper kind of a

piece of paper limited to that program?

government then terminate the funds to the student?
MR. LASCELL;

the program is the grant pregram

of the Congress has been that funds termination is to be

A last remedy.

Then the answer to the question

is yes .

And I thought your position was

that fund termination would never be proper in case of a

That's absolutely correct,

So we can really just ignore that

1

Your Honor, in a sense,

empirically it is a discrimination, but we are caught

here in this dilemma, that it’s the kind of

4

discrimination that existed before the federal

government created this program.

it, you couldn't go.

situation with this special kind of statute provision

10

that says we will help finance scholarship aid for you,

11

but what we want in return is an assurance that you do

12

not put your scholarship program on a discriminatory

13

ba sis.

14

Now, we don*'t think that that is a harsh or

15

terrible thing.

In fact, we are being cudgeled also on

16

the ground that that doesn't go far enough because we

17

are being told that that leaves open the possibility

18

that there will be discrimination in other parts of the

19

college, and many of the amici asked the question, well,

20

how can it be that Congress would have wished a student

21

with federal money to show up in a college which

22

discriminates in certain of its parts?

23

answer to that must be, Your Honor, that Congress in '72

24

was not thinking of this statute as whether you are for

or against discrimination.

feature of this case. Your Honors, that the Court of

It is the one that I was led to by

Our answer to that is that although Congress
was opposed to discrimination in all its forms, what

10

Congress was thinking about in

11

for or against discrimination in the abstract, but how

12

broad a federal regultory intervention should be

authorized, because regulation is -- always has an

element of overkill and overenforcement.

Congress decided in that statute -- and there was a vary

1

I think, Your Honor, they were

2

worried about that, but they were also worried about the

3

breadth of intervention on the Court of Appeals theory

4

of this case, which is a dollar of federal aid anywhere

5

sets up this economic ripple effect and leads to

6

regulation on a pervasive basis.
And we think that Congress, the size of the

8

gap that is left by the government's theory should net

9

be overstated because subsidized programs are covered,

10

we think admissions are covered unless explicitly

11

exempted.

12

Congress had in mind, too, that there are

13

other laws in play here, Title 7, the Constitution is in

14

play in the case of public institutions, as we learned

15

from Justice O'Connor's opinion in the Mississippi

Nursing case, state law is in play, and there are

fundamental ethical laws here that are in play that for

some of us, I hope a let of us, mean that we don’t

That's correct.

And it was re-enacted at a time

when — was it still in the same legislative basket with
Title 9?

Yes.

This agency interpretation of the

regulations was well known at the time.
MR. LASCELL;

Well, it was known in 1975 when

QUESTIONS

Do you think that, re-enactment

against that background is really just post-legislative

history or post-enactment history, or is it not?

15

MR. LASCELLs

I think it is, at best,

16

post-enactment legislative history, and I am very

17

uncomfortable suggesting to the Court just what that

18

means in this instance.

And nevertheless extended the grant

program which was part of Title 9.
MR. LASCELLs

That's also correct.

And that,
