CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

Mr. Dodyk, I think you

may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL K. DODYK, ESC.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. DODYKs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
In this appeal, Nestinghouse Electric
Corporation challenges the constitutionality of the way

10

in which the State of New York taxes the income of a

11

domestic international sales corporation or DISC.

12

A DISC is not a typical business corporation.

13

It is a vehicle established under the Internal Revenue

14

Code to permit the deferral of income taxes with respect

15

to certain income from exports.

16

attributed to a DISC and on which tax may be deferred is

17

determined by a formula set forth in the Internal

18

Revenue Code such as 50 percent of net income or 4

1

percent of gross receipts derived from exports.

20

The income which may be

DISCs typically perform no functions,

21

property, have no employees.

23

export-related income for purposes of tax deferral.

24
25

A DISC is essentially an

The export-related income so segregated is
essentially pure income separated from the costs which

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 30001 (202) 628-0300

1

generate that income.

2

of the business entities whose exports are in question.

3

Under the

Those costs remain on the books

Internal Revenue Code as it was in

4

effect during the relevant period, a taxpayer was

5

essentially permitted to defer federal taxes on 50

6 percent of income allocated to the DISC until that
7

income is distributed to the parent.

8

Turning to Westinghouse, Westinghouse and its

9

affiliates are engaged in a variety of businesses, seme

10 of which exports products, a portion of the income from
11

which during the relevant period was allocated by

12

Westinghouse to the DISC.
«

13

During the years here in question, 1972 and

14

1973,

approximately 75 to 80 percent of the Westinghouse

15

DISC income was derived from Westinghouse exports,

16 approximately 20 to 25 percent from affiliates of
17

18

Westinghouse.
The record in this case establishes that the

19

affiliates of Westinghouse did no business in New York.

20

It further establishes that the affiliates are

21

autonomous, independently managed, and deal with

22

Westinghouse on an arm's length basis.

23

The State of New York dees not treat these

24

affiliates as unitary with Westinghouse and has not

25

attempted to tax their income in recognition of the fact
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that they do not do business in the State of New York.

2

The tax practices here at issue arise from New

3

York's taxation of accumulated DISC income.

4

particular tax involved is the New York corporate income

5

tax.

6

appcrtioned tax.

The

The New York corporate income tax is a formula

7

In determining the amount of income which the

8

State of Sew York taxes, it first attempts to determine

9

the taxpayer's total income.

It then multiplies it by a

10

fraction which is determined by the relationship of the

11

taxpayer's New York property, payroll and revenue tc the

12

total payroll, property and revenue of the taxpayer.

13

In determining the amount of a taxpayer's

14

income to be apportioned to New York, the state in this

15

case added to the income of Westinghouse the total

16

income of its DISC, including the amount on which

17

federal taxes were deferred, and including the amount

18

derived by reason of exports by Westinghouse non-Hew

19

York affiliates.

20

Having determined the income apportioned tc

21

New York, the state then applied a tax rate of 9 percent

22

to that income as allocated to the State of New York.

23

In computing the tax actually due, however, the court

24

took another step, and that is, it permitted a credit

25

with respect to 70 percent of the tax due on accumulated
5

1

DISC income.

2

this case, because the State of New York, although it

3

permits that credit, it permits it only with respect to

4

exports which are shipped from a regular place cf

5

business in the State of New York.

6

in calculating the credit, the New York statute requires

7

the taxpayer to multiply its accumulated DISC income by

8

a fraction of which the numerator is gross receipts

9

shipped from New York, and the denominator gross

10
11

And it is that credit which is at issue in

More specifically,

receipts from exports shipped from all sources.
In this case the result was to limit the

12

credit permitted Westinghouse to approximately 5 percent

13

of the accumulated DISC income which New York taxed.

14

course, with respect to other corporations which have

15

their base of operations in New York, such as General

16

Electric, the credit is much greater.

Of

17

The basic result of New York's limitation on

18

the availability of the credit is that if a firm ships

19

exports from New York, it will pay a tax of 2.7 percent

20

on accumulated DISC income attributed to that shipment,

21

but if it ships that export from New Jersey or any state

22

other than New York, it will pay a tax of 9 percent.

23

But in terms of dollars, if you assume a corporation

24

with $100 million of accumulated DISC income, 50 percent

25

of which is apportioned to the State of New York, that

taxpayer will pay to the State of New York a tax in the

2

amount of 3^,500,000 if it ships from non-New York

3

facilities, but if it ships from New York facilities,

4

its tax bill will only be 3*1*350,000.
QUESTI0N«

6

Mr. Dodyk, what you’re saying is

6

basically that the federal Constitution requires the

7

credit New York extends you to be larger than it was

8

calculated to be under the statute.
ME. DODYKs

9

QUESTION:

10

That is correct, Your Honor.
I suppose you could win on that

11

point and still be worse off financially if the case

12

went back to the New York Court of Appeals after

13

reversing, and the New York Court of Appeals decided

14

that the New York legislature never would have enacted

15

the credit at all if it knew that this was going to be

16

the result.
MR. DODYK:

17

Hell, I guess in that case my

18

client, Westinghouse , would be a very altruistic

19

enforcer of constitutional principle.

20

have said I would have succeeded in shooting myself in

21

the foot.

22
23

Or some would

But in any event, that’s something for the
Court of Appeals on remand to determine.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. DODYK:

If you win.
Yes, of course.
7

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Our argument is essentially a simple one, and

2

that is, that any tax scheme which works that

3

difference, which imposes a higher rate of tax on

4

shipments which are made outside the taxing state than

5

it does on the same equivalent shipment made inside the

6

State of New York is an unconstitutional burden on the

7

commerce clause because it discriminates against

8

interstate commerce.

9

In this particular case we believe that the

10

operation of the credit and

11

exacerbated by the fact that the State of New York

12

requires the taxpayer to add to its income base the

13

entire amount of DISC income, but excludes from the

14

denominator of the apportionment formula the property,

15

payroll and revenue of the non-New York affiliates whose

16

shipments accounted for 20 to 25 percent of the DISC

17

income involved in this case.

18

QUESTION*

its unconstitutionality is

Let me ask right there, the

19

shipments that originated in New York, were all of them

20

made in interstate commerce?
/

21

MR. DODYK:

22

QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor.
So then it’s really not a

23

discrimination against interstate commerce; it's a

24

discrimination between two kinds of interstate commerce.

25

HR. DODYK*

In a sense that is true.

And much

8

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

.the same was the case, of course, in the Eostcn Stock

2

Exchange case where the Court observed, I guess for the

3

first time, that even if one is dealing with a

4

discrimination between two forms of interstate commerce,

5

that is still a form of discrimination which the

6

commerce clause proscribes.
Essentially, we believe that this case is

7
8

governed by the Boston Stock Exchange case and Maryland

9

v. Louisiana.

In Boston Stock Exchange, New York

10

imposed a tax on any transfer of securities which had

11

certain defined connections or contacts with the State

12

of New York.
That tax scheme, however, included a deduction

13
14

or I should say a credit and a limitation which was

15

applicable if the transfer was executed on a New York

10

Stock Exchange, so that the effect was that a transfer

17

which was executed on the Boston Stock Exchange or seme

18

other stock exchange would bear a higher rate of tax

19

than a transfer which was executed on the New York Stock

20

Exchan ge.

21

And we submit that this case is no different.

22

In the Boston Stock Exchange case if you executed that

23

transfer, you paid a higher rate of tax if that transfer

24

was executed in Boston as opposed to New York, so here,

25

if you ship the export from the port of Boston, you pay
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

a higher rate of tax than you do if you ship that export

2

from New York.

3

Similarly, in Maryland v. Louisiana, the State

4

of Louisiana imposed a tax on the first use of natural

5

gas coming into the state from wells located on the

6

federal offshore properties, and it then built into the

7

tax scheme a series of limitations in deductions which

8

effectively limited the incidence of that tax to gas

9

which was shipped out of Louisiana to out-of-state

10

users, and this Court held that set of limitations tc

11

work an unconstitutional discrimination against

12

interstate commerce.

13

Although obviously Appellees do not accept our

14

characterization of their tax as discriminatory, they do

15

not deny, they have never denied and cannot deny that

16

the effect of that tax, economic effect, is to impose a

17

higher rate of tax if an export is shipped from a

18

non-New York facility as compared to one which is

19

shipped from a New York facility.

20

Appellees have not cited a single case in

21

which this Court has sustained a state tax which has

22

that differential geographical impact, and to our

23

knowledge there are no cases which do so.

24
25

Appellees* response really consists of two
basic arguments.

One is justification by reference to
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

apportionment, and one is argument by analogy.

2

They say that the constitutionality of the

3

taxes was deemed because the tax is a properly

4

apportioned income tax.

5 for two reasons.

That argument, I submit, fails

First, as we have pointed out, the tax

6

is not properly apportioned; and second, and egually

7

important, apportionment is irrelevant to the reason why

8

we are urging that the tax is unconstitutional.
The reason that the New York tax is

9
10

unconstitutional is that it results in a higher tax rate

11

if property is shipped from a non-New York source than

12

if the property is shipped from a New York source.

13

14

NR. DODYKs

NR. DODYKs

17

Both owned by the same —
Pardon?
Both owned by the same entity?
Yes.

Both owned by the same

18

So even if the base of the tax were proper —

19

QUESTION*

Nr. Dodyk, does that always

20

follow?

21

from New York, might it not?

22

Your income tax might well go up if you ship

MR. DODYKs

Well, it might well go up in the

23

sense that you would have added payroll and property to

24

the numerator if you established the facility in New

25

York as opposed to having the facility established in
11

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

New Jersey

2

But I submit. Your Honor, that effect is going

3

to be infinitesimal, because all you're talking about

4

here is establishing a warehouse and handling facility,

5

the property and payroll of which are but a small

6

fraction of the property and payroll which came together

7

into the manufacture and shipment of the product in

8

question .

9

So to the extent that the state relies on an

10

offsetting increase, I submit that the underlying

11

economics will not support the argument.

12

Now, the reason why the formula apportionment

13

defense I think fails is because we're not attacking at

14

this point the tax based on its basis.

15

that formula apportionment is wrong; we’re saying that

10

what's wrong is allowing a credit to a taxpayer which

17

turns on the locus from which the export is shipped.

18

And because that is the source of the

19

unconstitutionality, we submit that the basis of the tax

20

is simply irrelevant.

We're not saying

Or to put it another way, if you take a lock

21
22

at the Boston Stock Exchange case, which to my mind

23

involved a very similar form of discrimination which was

24

struck

25

New York could tax that stock transfer which was

down, there was no question but that the State of

12

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

executed on the Boston Stock Exchange.

2

accepted that there were sufficient contacts with the

3

State of Hew York to permit the tax, but the

4

unconstitutionality arose from the difference in the

5

rate of tax applied because of where the transfer was

e

execut ed.

The Court

Similarly, in Maryland v. Louisiana, the

7
8

taxable incident was first use of natural gas within the

9

state.

The federal government did argue that the first

10

use also made the tax unconstitutional, but this Court

11

rejected that argument and said for purposes of the

12

opinion it assumed that the State of Louisiana had

13

sufficient contact with the first use to permit it to

14

impose a tax.

15

So that in both Boston Stock Exchange and

10

Maryland v. Louisiana, the basis of the tax was a valid

17

basis, just as the Appellees here argue formula

18

apportionment constitutes a valid basis.

19

New,

the Appellees seek to avoid the governing

20

force of Maryland v. Louisiana and Boston Stock Exchange

21

by suggesting a distinction, and the distinction is that

22

in Eoston Stock Exchange and Maryland v. Louisiana ycu

23

were dealing with a transactional tax in a sense,

24

whereas here we're not dealing with a transactional tax

25

but with a formula apportioned income tax.
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

It's true that distinction does exist in the

2

facts of the cases, but Appellees have never suggested

3

any reason why the difference in the tax base should

4

make any constitutional difference.

5

submit that difference, the difference between formula

6

apportionment and transaction is irrelevant because the

7

source of the unconstitutionality is the discriminatory

8

impact which results from the application of the credit.

9

And, again, I

The argument by analogy. Appellees in amicus

10

argue that since they could constitutionally take a

11

variety of other steps to reduce the impact of state

12

taxation that they should likewise be permitted to

13

implement the credit scheme here at issue.

14

Appellees* only authority for that proposition

15

is an oft-repeated quotation which they take from the

16

Boston Stock Exchange case to the effect that states may

17

use their taxing power to compete with other states for

18

a share of interstate commerce.

19

amicus go on to cite as alternative measures which they

20

might constitutionally takei

21

protection, providing investment subsidies, reduced

22

taxation of exports, abolition of DISC income taxation,

23

and indeed, abolition of the corporate income tax

24

altcge ther.

25

And then Appellees in

providing police and fire

I submit that the phrase relied upon from
14

2

Court with informed guidance for the resolution of the

3

particular constitutional questions presented here.

4
5

To say that states may generally use their
taxing power to compete for interstate commerce is tc

8 say nothing about the legality of a tax which results in
7

higher rates being imposed on out-of-state export

8

shipments as compared to in-state export shipments.

9

Moreover/ that language appears only as a

10 general reservation in the context of an opinion in

which this Court struck down a taxing scheme which is

12
13

very similar to the one we have here at bar.
The various alternative tax and incentive

14

schemes which Hew York adduces as being -- justifying

analogy are all distinguishable in that none of

involves a tax which weighs more heavily on out-of-state

shipments than in-state shipments.

Of course, a state

18 may choose to abolish taxes on DISC income, on export
19

income or on corporate income altogether; but in none of

those cases does the state create a tax, the rate of

which differs depending on the location from which the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER H. SCHIFF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. SCHIFF*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

22

My view of the case that Mr. Dodyk has argued

23

is very different from what I understand the case to be

24

and what the facts to be.

25

to me a good part of what Nr. Dodyk has argued are the

As a matter of fact,

it seems

16

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

issues on which you relate to the second issue in the

2

jurisdictional statement with respect to which you

3

dismissed it for being insubstantial.

4

It seems to me it's the law of the case that

5

the — New York was perfectly proper in viewing

6

Kestinghouse and the Westinghouse DISC on a unitary

7

basis.

8

I've heard just now and in their briefs, seems to

9

challenge the application of the unitary principle.

Nevertheless, a good part of the argument that

10

Admittedly, it is done by the back door in

11

relation to the credit, but it seems to underlie the

12

claim that somehow New York is taxing out-of-state

13

income or is — because they claim that we are -- about

14

the credit, that the measurement of the credit is wrong

15

because we base it on DISC income related to shipments

16

from a place of business in New York, but that we don't

17

give it credit if the shipments are from a place outside

18

New York, assumes that we are somehow taxing income that

19

is outside the state.

20

Now, what New York has done here in applying

21

the three-factor business allocation formula which this

22

Court so recently reaffirmed in the Container case, was

23

to only tax New York income.

24
25

Now, once it's determined what the overall
amount of New York income is, we submit that it was
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

reasonable for New York to apply a credit only to that

2

portion of the accumulated DISC income, and that's the

3

DISC income for which the federal government provides a

4

tax break, is to try to ascertain what of the total

5

amount of DISC income is reasonably attributable to New

6

York.

7

Because in the first place in applying the

8

business allocation formula, as our Court of Appeals has

9

said, New York is only taxing New York income.

And I

10

think it would be a strange policy indeed, whether the

11

commerce clause or any other provision of the

12

Constitution, to say that we have to give a credit cn

13

income that we have never taxed in the first place.

14

QUESTION:

Hell, isn't that upside down,

15

though, really?

If — if all of the DISC income had

16

arisen from shipments from New York, there had been the

17

same unitary income but the tax would — you wouldn't

18

have had any tax on the DISC.

Well, anyway -- anyway your credit

would have applied to all the DISC income, wouldn't it?

QUESTION;

3

HR. SCHIFFi

Oh, I understand that.
And the question then is do we

4

have to tax the DISC income at the same rate as all

5

other New York income, and that's all that the division

0

here involves.

Other business income which — that’s

7 related to New York which isn’t DISC income we rate —
8

we tax at the 9 percent level.

If it is DISC income or

9

if we have an investment tax credit or some other

10 credit, it is a somewhat lesser rate.
11

Now, let me also P9int cut that the credit

12 here -- Mr. Dodyk keeps talking about we tax it at 2.7
13

percent.

If he had used the figures in the record as

14

applied to Westinghouse rather than deriving

15

hypothetical examples throughout his brief, the

10

effective tax rate on the accumulated DISC income which

17 is derivable from the record in 1972, one of the years
18 in question here, was approximately 8.69 percent; in
19

1973 it was about 8.65 percent — the fact reflected by

20

the actual size of the credit here.

21

credit in 1975 that they are objecting to and apparently

22

they want to pay more is about 52,500.

23

about $6,000, even though Westinghouse was paying an

24

And I suggest in response to a question that

Justice Rehnquist asked that the — that if Westinghcuse

were to win in this case, that it would be, in terms of

the questions that have been left open by this Court, an

5

invalidation of a DISC credit in its entirety with the

6

result that yes, indeed, Mr. Dodyk would be shooting

7

himself in the foot because his client would be paying

8

about $10,000 more for the two years here in question.

9

Whether he could then change the New York

10

legislature's way of determining the credit I do not

11

know, but I don’t think it is a legislative question.

The issue here is whether the DISC credit is invalid or

not and not how it was computed.

QUESTION:

Well, the hope is — well, if

You stand by those statements, I

take it.
MR. SCHIFF:

Of course.

If they do some New

York export business, if they are generating some of
their income from New York business, and that’s being
exported — because that’s the only thing that the DISC

2

credit relates to — we will then apply a lower tax rate

3

to that income, which we think is totally consistent

4

with this Court’s language in the Boston Stock Exchange

5

case and other cases like the Bowers case which permit

6

states to give credit to try to compete.

7

Now, there is a major difference between our

8

tax and the credit in this case and the Boston Stock

9

case and the Maryland against Louisiana case.

In these

20

cases — in the Boston case it was clear that New York

2

was — while it was — it was attempting to tax

22

extraterritorially,

I think.

23

We are imposing a tax on the stock transfer,

24

but we oppose the full tax, but it varied depending on

25

whether the transfer was being accomplished through an

2

Exchange.

the New York Stock

There was, however, enough incidents to tax it

3
4

in New York because the transfer of the stock

5

certificate, I think, was happening there, so that we

6

were discriminating depending on where part of the

7

transaction happened.
In this case the only thing that we tax in

8
9

applying the unitary principle is New York income, and

10

then we only apply credit to the New York income.

11

matter of fact,

12

because we use these two percentages, which means that

13

the credit boils down to something like a quarter of one

14

percen t.

it*s a very, very conservative credit

also relevant.

Well, but I — I, with all due

respect, I do not see how we get to discrimination in

11

this case if we are not taxing, as they suggest,

12

extraterritorial values in the first place, or giving a

The statement made is that we should not be

are definitely not doing that.

may be my problem, I have had difficulty in
