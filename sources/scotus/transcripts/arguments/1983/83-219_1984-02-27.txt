CEAI ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. ACHTENEERG , ESQ.,

7

ON BEHAIF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ACHTENBERG;

10

please

Mr. Chief Justice, and iray it

the Court;
Gary McDonald brought this Section 1983 action

11

to establish that his discharge violated his rights

12

under the Constitution.

13

whether he should have been forbidden to do that because

14

of a prior arbitration decision -- a decision which did

15

not deal with the ccnstituticnal issue, a decision by an

16

arbitrator who was not presented with and did not decide

17

the constitutional issue.

18

The issue before this Court is

In Alexander v. Gardner-Denver and in

19

Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight this Court held that

20

pricr arbitration awards did net bar subsequent acticns

21

under the Fair labor Standards Act and under Title VII.

22

And the issue before this Ccurt today is whether there

23

is some reason why a different rule should apply to

24

Section 1983 cases.

25

Me Donald was discharged after receiving and

complaints against the chief of police.

3

complaints by members cf the public.

4

officer he had received from at least six different

5

women complaints that the chief was involved in some

6

form of sexual misconduct or sexual assault.

7

these on to various city officials, and an investigation

8

of the chief ensued.

and threatened McDonald and threatened one of the ether

He told McDonald cn at least twe occasions

11

that he would have his job for starting the

12

13

This harassment culminated when McDonald set

14

up a meeting where one of the complaining women was to

15

present certain information to the mayor in her own

16

words.

17

threatened the woman, he threatened McDonald.

18

said that he would have McDonald's job for starting the

investigation.

the city council that McDonald would be fired, and the

21

actual firing took place the day after that.

the grievance procedure provided in the collective

1

the problems which are involved in using arbitration in

2

this sort cf case.

3

McDonald was provided essentially no notice of

4

the only charge which the arbitrator sustained against

5

him — the charge cf having committed a sexual assault

6

on a minor female.

7

took the stand at arbitration, McDonald was never told

8

who it was he was supposed

where he was supposed to have assaulted her.

QUESTIONi

Until the alleged victim, Mrs. Dack,

Did he ask for an adjournment tc

prepare to meet those charges?

him by the union did net.

14

QUESTION*

So.

The attorney assigned to

Well, does that bring up the

15

subject cf waiver possibly?

16

about something now that he didn’t object to then.

17

MR. ACHTENBERG*

Because you’re complaining

I don't believe it can be

18

said that he had not made the request on numerous

19

occasions.

20

entitled to a waiver under the contract is one that ve

21

have absolutely nothing in the record on.

22

and I think that that brings us tc one cf the ether

23

problems with using arbitration to resolve individual

24

rights questions; ar.d that is that McDonald did not

25

control his own defense.

The question of whether he would have been

Just as --

It was not his decision

decision --

QUESTION*

4

MB. ACHTENEEFG;

It was the

Whose decision was it?
It was the decision of the

5

attorney assigned tc him by the union over his

6

cbjecticn.

7

whether he could have his own attorney present and was

8

told he could net.

He did not even make the decision to

9

go to arbitration.

That decision was made by the union.

10

He — he requested — he asked the union

The union, together with the city, without the

11

involvement of McDonald, picked the arbitrator.

12

union's attorney elected not to call the crucial witness

13

whe would have corroborated McDonald's testimony; that

14

is that the so-called Dack incident simply never

15

occurred; that McDonald never touched Earbara Dack, that

16

he never said anything offensive to her.

17

was called at trial and was undoubtedly persuasive

18

corroboration of McDonald's testimony tc the same effect.
QUESTICNi

19

And the

That witness

Well, Mr. Achetenberg, is that any

20

different than if this had, say, been a trial in a trial

21

court of general jurisdiction, and the petitioner's

22

lawyer

23

kind of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,

24

isn't it?

25

there hadn't called a witness.

ME. ACHTENBEEGs

I mean that's

I don't believe so.

The —

1

the lack of control over ycur own defense in a situation

2

in which the counsel represents you, net the interests

3

of the union, is somewhat different than the situation

4

where the attorney is there to represent the union's

5

intere st.
QUESTIONS

6

Are you suggesting that the unicn

7

had kind of a secret interest in not calling this

8

particular witness, or just that the union lawyer wasn't

9

particularly diligent?
MR. ACHTENBERGs

10

We don't knew why the union's

11

lawyer did not call this witness.

12

concerns about what effects that might have on the

13

witness, on the witness himself, whe was also a unicn

14

member .
QUESTION;

15

He may have had

Was any effort made after the

16

arbitration hearing to find out, to raise these

17

questions with the attorney who represented him?
MR. ACHTENPEEG;

18

The original complaint in

19

this case had the union joined in a state law pendant

20

claim as a defendant fer failure of adequate

21

representation.

22

on the merits but cn the basis that it did not want to

23

take pendant jurisdiction over that state law issue.

24

New, that has not teen further pursued; at

25

least

The district court dismissed that, not

to my knowledge that has not been pursued.

QUESTION;

1

If you did net prevail here, would

2

you have an action over in the state courts against the

3

union cr the union lawyer?
HR. ACHTENBERG:

4
5

I believe it would be time

barred .
The issue presented to the arbitrator was not

6

7

even the same issue which is presented by the Section

8

1983 complaint.

9

in the

Under Kount Healthy v. Doyle, the issue

1983 complaint is one of motive, one of what was

10

in Chief Longstreet's mind.

11

discharge McDonald even without the First Amendment

12

activity?

3

Would he have decided to

The question the arbitrator decided was a

4

different issue, and that was simply whether there was a

5

justificaticn assuming pure motive.

6

to what happened in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver where

7

the arbitrator -- in Alexander the employee was charged

8

with having produced too many defective parts.

9

in a parts plant.

It’s very similar

He was

The arbitrator dealt with the issue

20

of whether or not he produced too many defective parts

2

and whether that was grounds under the contract for the

22

discharge, but not with the issue of whether that was

23

the real reason for the discharge, whether in fact

24

racial discrimination was being masked ty this

25

justificaticn.
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Similarly here the arbitrator did not deal

1
2

with the issue of whether anti-First Amendment animus,

3

you might call it, was being masked here by the excuse

4

of the — of the Dack incident, which — or the alleged

5

Dack incident.
I think I should deal with the argument made

6
7

primarily by amicus EEAC that we need to avoid -- we

8

need to grant preclusion in this case because otherwise

9

we will fill the courts with Section 1983 cases.

I

10

don't think that will happen, but before we turn tc

11

that,

12

Congress has expressed a fundamental commitment to the

13

vindication of this sort of right.

14

I think it's important to remember that we --

In 1871 when federal causes of action were few

15

and far between, Congress thought these rights were

16

important enough to create such a cause of action.

17

again in 1976 when it passed the Civil Eights Attorney's

18

Fee Act, Congress expressed its belief that these cases

19

were sufficiently important that special incentives in

20

the way of attorneys'

21

should be provided to bring them.

22

that this sort of fundamental congressional commitment

23

should be lightly ignored; but I don't think that

24

considerations of judicial economy necessarily militate

25

in favor of granting preclusion.

And

And I don't think

1

As this Court pointed out in Alexander v.

2

Gardner-Eenver, and I believe in Earrentine, granting a

3

rule of preclusion will give incentives to unions and

4

employees to skip the arbitration process and instead go

5

directly into court, either state or federal.

QUESTION:

Well, if the contract calls for

arbitration, they can't skip it.
MR. ACHTENBERG:
as to the Section

They could skip arbitration

QUESTION:

I'm speaking of the general claims

of discharges, all the working conditions.
MR. ACHTENBERG:

That's correct.

They could

l

13

not skip the Section 1S83 -- I'm sorry — they could not

14

skip arbitration as to their contractual claims.

15

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that perhaps the

16

unions wouldn't agree to arbitration in the collective

17

bargaining agreements if that were so?

18

MR. ACHTENBERG:

It is possible that they

19

might not agree to arbitration, but I think more likely

20

that they would exclude specifically this sort of claim

21

rather than doing sc implicitly, as I think they have in

22

most cases.

23

claim sc that although the contractual issue might be

24

resolved in arbitration, the 1983 constitutional claim

25

would be separated out and clearly could net be

They might explicitly exclude this sort of

therefore, cases which would otherwise be resolved in

arbitration, either because the employee won and got the

All of those

What is the status of this

arbitration decision under state law?
ME. ACHTENBEEGi

12

Under state law this

13

arbitration decision would ret be given preclusive

effect in a subsequent action to vindicate individual

15

rights.

16

identical, but very similar to the same sort of effect

17

that the federal courts give it in —

It would be given a — I'm not sure it's

QUESTION;

18

What if the — what if the

19

arbitration turned on why a person was fired, a factual

20

issue,

21

would

22

in a state court proceeding, which you would say would

23

not be totally precluded as res judicata, but what about

24

the factual determination in the arbitration under state

25

law?

and any suit to vindicate an individual right
also turn on the same fact?

How about in -- in --

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. ACHTENBEEGi

1

I think the answer to that is

2

in Eichigan Civil Rights Commission ex rel. Eoyd v.

3

Chrysler, in which the Michigan court said that --

4

quoted the portion of Alexander which said that the

5

federal court should try the case de novo.
QUESTION;

6

Well,

I'm asking what about -- how

7

about the trial on — how about a trial in the state

8

court?

9

MR. ACHTENEERG;

Yeah.

That's the — as I

10

understand Michigan ex rel. Eoyd, it is saying that in

11

state court —

12

QUESTION;

Suppose you're wrong about that?

13

Suppose that that factual determination would be

14

conclusive in the state suit.

15

MR. ACHTENEEEG;

16

QUESTION;

Let's just suppose that.

I don't --

Then wouldn't that have just as

17

much impact on a 1983 suit as would a state judicial

18

determination?

19

MR. ACHTENEEEG;

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. ACHTENEERG*

I don't believe sc.

Why not?
As I believe you yourself

22

said in Kremer, Section 1738 does not apply to

23

arbitration awards.

24

awards because Section —

25

QUESTION;

It does net apply to arbitration

Well,

yes, but suppose the state
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

court — after all, I may have said that* I may be wrong.

2

(Laughter. )

3

QUESTION:

I frequently am.

But under state

4

law, let's just assume the arbitration proceeding had

5

just as much binding effect as a judicial determination

6

cf a fact.

Now, why shouldn't —
ME. ACHTENBEEG:

7

I think that the reasons that

8

this Court recited in Alexander and Barrentine are at

9

least as applicable in the First Amendment context, the

10

1983 context, as they were in the context of Title H II

11

or in the context of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Arbitrators are not judges.

12

Arbitrators are

13

not bound by the rules cf evidence that -- that bird

14

15

an adequate record.

16

QUESTION:

They do not have an -- they often do not have
They often are not lawyers.
Section 1738, too, speaks in terms

17

of judicial procedures, doesn't it, net arbitration

18

proceedings.

19

federal courts to give full faith and credit.

20

21
22

It’s a federal statute that requires

ME. ACHTENEEFG:

It specifically refers to

judicial proceedings -QUESTION:

Well,

that wouldn't — even if

23

didn't apply, as you suggest that somebody else has

24

suggested, that still doesn't dispose cf the issue.

25

1738 doesn't reach it, but why would — well, do you

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1738

1

think the Court should he precluded from giving the same

2

finality to a factual determination in an arbitration as

3

a state court would?
ME. ACHTENEEEG:

4
5

be a bad decision to do so.
QUESTION:

6
7

And also you think inconsistent

with our prior cases.
ME. ACHTENEEEG:

8
9

I think — I think it would

Yeah.

I think it'd certainly

be inconsistent with both Alexander and with

10

Barrentine.

And the reasons that this Court set forth

11

in those two cases I think apply at least as strongly

12

here,

13

motive, we have issues which involve a statute which has

14

been subject to construction since 1871, and a

15

Constitution, or in this case constitutional amendment

16

which has been subject to construction long before that .

17

The -- the issues presented in these cases are

because here again we have issues which involve

18

at least as foreign to an arbitrator as the issues

19

presented in Barrentine, which involved a -- a wage,

20

essentially a wage dispute.

21

Justice said — said in dissent in Barrentine, a civil

22

rights case is substantially different than a wage case.

23

QUESTION:

And as I believe the Chief

In any event, you take the position

24

that Michigan law wculd net give preclusive effect tc

25

the determinations of the arbitrator?
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

ME. ACHTENBERG;

1

It would not in a subsequent

2

individual rights case.

3

contract, they would give it the same — not exactly the

4

same as I read the case, but very similar tc the sort of

5

deference given by the Steelworkers trilogy.

6

the Michigan courts have cited the Steelworkers trilogy

7

with some regularity, just as they have cited Alexander

8

and Barrentine.

I think that the decision in Michigan ex rel. Eoyd and

2

in Eetroit Fire Fighters pretty clearly deals with that

issue.
QUESTION;

You make a point that he wasn't

informed, your client wasn't informed about an appeal

from the arbitrator's award.

MR. ACHTENEEFG:

collaterally attacking the arbitration award.

Those are

12

QUESTION*

For fraud -- for fraud, for example.

13

MR. ACHTFNEEFG;

Yeah.

Those are available to

14

the union, and there's a suit for breach of fair

15

representation which would be avail -- which would be

16

available to the employee.
QUESTION :

17

But when he hired — when he joined

18

the union, he, in effect, hired the union to represent

19

him in all matters of this kind, did he not?
MR. ACHTFNEEFG:

20

I don't believe sc.

I think

21

he "hired” perhaps involuntarily, although net in this

22

case.

23

to represent him with regard to the contract, with

24

regard to his rights in collective bargaining.

He was a member cf the union.

MR. ACHTENEEEG;

Disputes under the contract.

Isn't that covered?

QUESTION;

Well, a discharge — a discharge is

a dispute under the contract, is it not?
MR. ACHTENBERG;

6

It may, and it may also le a

7

dispute under the Constitution.

As this Court

8

recognized, I think, in Perry v. Sindermann, your right

9

not to be discharged for exercising your First Amendment

10

rights is independent of any right you may have under a

11

contract.

12

discharged under the contract, you still have the right

13

as a public employee not to be discharged for exercise

14

of your First Amendment rights.

15

Even if you have no right not to be

QUESTION;

May I ask you a question?

In your

answers to Justice White you were considering whether

21

the state court be free to make its own decision on

preclusion, or would it be compelled to follow a federal

rule that you advocate?

24
25

I'd just like to ask

Do you argue -- suppose this case had

MR. ACHTENBERG;

1983; would

I think the state court as an

issue of preclusion — I believe that the correct answer
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

is that the state court has to follow the federal rule

2

In other words, you’re in effect

arguing that 1983 compels the result that you're seeking.

MR. flCHTENEEFG;

7

even if you applied 1738 sort cf analysis,

8

v. Prosise and I think also under Migra, this Court has

9

held the mest preclusion ycu can give is the preclusion

10

I think the enactment cf an
But I think that
under Haring

that the state gives.
I'll point out that I don't think that the

11
