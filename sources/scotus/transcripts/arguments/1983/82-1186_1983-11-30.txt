ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. ROMANS, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF TRANSWQRLD AIRLINES, INC.

8

MR. ROMANSi

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court.

10

The issue to be decided in this case is

11

whether the United States courts are dutybcund to

12

enforce.the limitations of liability of the Warsaw

13

Convention, and if so, how the Warsaw gold franc, which

14

is the unit used to express that limitation of

15

liability, is to be converted into present U.S. dollars.

16

The facts are agreed and quickly stated.

17

Franklin Mint delivered four cartons tc TWA in

18

Philadelphia for shipment to London, England.

QUESTIONS

MR. ROMANS*

21

QUESTIONS

22

In March of 1979, Your Honor.
I don't believe the briefs put it

out, but I am curious.

23

MR. ROMANS*

24

QUESTION*

25

When?

That is when -- March of 1979.
And will you tell us how they were

lost as you go along?

MR. ROMANS:

1

Your Honor, if T knew how they

2

were lost, we might not be here today.

3

that they were not delivered in London, and we could not

4

find them anywhere in the system.

5

four cartons weighed 714 pounds, that the entire fee to

6

carry

7

that Franklin Mint told TWA that one carton contained

8

"metal stamping dies, metal stampings, numismatic,

9

articles of adornment," and that the three ether

10

All we know is

We dc know that the

them to London was less than $550, and we do know

packages contained "metal stampings, numismatic."
Now, when the packages did not arrive in

11

12

London, Franklin Mint made a claim, and it claimed that

13

it was entitled to $250,000 because it turned out that

14

metal stampings, numismatic, meant gold coins.

15

Now, Franklin Mint knew that TWA's limitation

16

of liability was $20 per kilogram, and that its overall

17

liability was $6,500, based on the weight of 714

18

pounds.

19

limit of liability if it chose to do sc.

20

declared an excess value.

21

TWA, we have gold coins here, and they are worth

22

$250,000.

23

have declared an excess value, and now we are going to

24

charge an excess charge for this high value shipment.

25

Franklin Mint could easily have avoided this
It could have

It could have said, look,

In that case, TWA would have said, yes, you

But Franklin Mint chose not to do that.

QUESTION*

The procedure you just described is

permissible under the Warsaw Convention?

3

MR. ROMANS i

4

No value was declared, and in the box for

5

declared value, Franklin Mint typed in the initials

6

"NVD,"

7

course, never showed up.

8
9

Absolutely right, Your Honor.

which mean no value declared, and the gold, of

Now, on oral argument before Judge Napp of the
District Court, he commented that Franklin Mint knew

10

that there was gold in those cartons.

11

thief knew that there was gold in those cartons.

12

TWA was left in ignorance.

Evidently the
Only

13

Now, we moved for partial summary judgment in

14

the District Ccurt to reduce our liability to our limit

15

of $6,500, and the question before the District Court,

16

as is here today, is, how do you convert these Warsaw

17

gold francs into U.S. currency?

18

alternative conversion factors, one the last official

19

price of gold, which would lead to the $20 per kilogram

20

limitation.

21

right, a unit of account of the International Monetary

22

Fund.

23

substantially the same.-

24
25

And we suggested two

Cur second one was the special drawing

That would lead to a limitation of liability

Franklin Mint countered and suggested that the
market price of gold be used as the conversion factor.

6

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

That would have led to a limit of liability

2

approximately ten times higher, because the market price

3

of gold at that time was roughly $420 per ounce.
The District Court held that the last official

4
5

price should apply because that was the conversion

6

factor that the Civil Aeronautics Board ordered the

7

airlines to use in their current and effective order.

8

That was the conversion factor that all of the airlines

9

listed in their tariffs, which are filed.

And that

10

conversion factor constituted as close as anything the

11

government’s interpretation of how this treaty should be

12

constr ued.

13

Now, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and after

14

affirming it said, each choice has a powerful argument

15

against it.

16

days from the issuance of the Court of Appeals mandate,

17

the limitations of liability of this treaty will be

18

unenforceable in United States courts.

19

Enforcement by a court is impossible, so 60

Now, I would like to briefly discuss the

20

abrogation issue.

The Court of Appeals correctly stated

21

that U.S. courts do not have the power, absent a

22

Constitutional infirmity, to abrogate U.S. treaties, put

23

that in a very succinct footnote, Number 26, and you are

24

absolutely right.

25

courts don't have the power under these facts to

Then it went ahead to hold that

2

the intent of the drafters.

3

Here, I feel the Court of Appeals was in

4

error.

5

purpose of this treaty, and that is, it sets a

6

limitation on liability and also a floor.

7

always so readily recognized in the United States is

8

that the laws of many countries, and there are over 120

9

which adhere to this treaty, the laws of many countries

They lost sight, in my view, of the primary

What is not

10

require limitations of liability which are much lower

11

than the Warsaw Convention, and the Warsaw Convention

12

says that the limit will be no higher than $20 per kilo,

13

but it also says any agreement entered into prior tc the

14

loss which would result in a limit lower than $20 a kilo

15

is void, so, the convention establishes both a floor and

16

a ceiling.

17

The Court of Appeals based its opinion on the

18

fact that one section of the Par Value Modification Act

19

had been repealed, and that is when the world went off

20

the gold standard and adopted special drawing rights.

21

They felt that it was impossible to select any

22

conversion factor, and

23

to construe this convention.

that therefore they were unable

24

We submit that neither the Repeal Act nor the

25

legislative history mentions the Warsaw Convention, and

that in order for a court to find that a later past

2

statute has abrogated a U.S. treaty, there must be clear

3

intent on the part of Congress to abrogate that treaty,

4

and there is no clear intent.
In fact, Judge Winter, writing for the Second

Circuit, acknowledged that fact.

17

that the Congress knew very well that there would be

Act.

They are here to inform this Court

Do any of those units of the

21

government have the power to abrogate or modify

22

treaties?

MR. POMANS:

Yes, Your Honor, they do.

The

HR. ROMANS:

No, Your Honor, I am not, but -You are arguing it is in force.

Correct.
Well —
That's — yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

Eut you are referring to all these

23

other branches of the United States government.

I am

24

asking you, do any of those branches have the authority

25

to redefine the terms of this treaty?

No, Your Honor.

That has tc he

done in a convention, with all the treaty partners

presen t•

4

QUESTION*

So why are the views of the

5

Solicitor General any more persuasive than those of any

6

other litigant?
MR. ROMANS*

7

Because it seems to me that when

8

this Court interprets a treaty, it is very helpful to

9

understand how the government, which is more experienced

10

in the delicate areas of foreign relations, views the

11

treaty.

12

QUESTION *

Well, it isn’t just their

13

experience, is it?

14

government has a responsibility.

15

relations with other countries can be affected by how a

16

treaty is construed.

17

Isn’t it their concern?

MR. ROMANS*

The

The government's

Absolutely right. Your Honor, and

18

as the government has said in its brief, several treaty

19

partners have communicated their displeasure with the

20

decision of the Second Circuit, and the United States

21

informs this Court that our foreign relations with those

22

countries in the aviation area will be seriously

23

affected, and this is a way. Hr. Justice Stevens, that

24

the United States can assist this Court, bringing this

25

kind of information to it.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

QUESTION*

1

I suppose, counsel, that even

2

before the repeal of the Par Value Modification Act, the

3

free market price of geld had fluctuated and might have

4

been above that value,

5

before the repeal, weren't they?
MR, ROMANS*

6

so people were well aware of that

Yes, Your Honor»

They were very

7

well aware that there was a two-tier system since 1968

8

until

1978.
QUESTION*

9

And I guess no one then questioned

10

whether it should be the official price that was

11

followed under the Warsaw Convention.
MR. ROMANS*

12
13

Honor,

because the law was very clear.
QUESTION*

14
15
16

Not in the United States, Ycur

Right,

I am talking about this

countr y .
MR. ROMANS*

That the Civil Aeronautics Eoard

17

had issued an order, and that order is still in effect.

18

We are commanded tc make this conversion according tc

19

the last official price of gold.

20

QUESTION*

Moreover —

Sc, in the absence of any

21

indication by Congress that it intended to alter the

22

Warsaw Convention, there would be no reason to alter the

23

formula that we follow, would there?

24

MR. ROMANS:

25

QUESTION*

Precisely.
Mr. Romans, is there any room here

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

for an interpretation that the parties intended to take

2

the dollar value of gold, which I gather is what you are

3

suggesting, of the gold franc just before we went off

4

the gold standard and inflating it by some appropriate

5

index of inflation of the dollar since that time?

6

NR. ROMANS*

7

QUESTIONS

8

No, Your Honor.

Not precisely.

Well, wouldn't that come closer to

effectuating the signatories in fact?
KB. ROMANS*

Well, actually, this question has

10

been studied as late as 1975.

There have been several

11

conventions of the treaty partners, and in 1975, the

12

Montreal Protocols to the Warsaw Convention were drafted

13

and signed by the United States.

14

increased significantly the limits of liability for

15

death and personal injury.

10

that the limit of liability for cargo should remain at

17

the same level.

Those protocols

However, it was determined

Now, that was expressed in terms of special

18
1

drawing rights,

17 special drawing rights,

but 17

20

special drawing rights amount to approximately $20 per

21

kilogram, so that the parties felt that the limit for

22

purposes of cargo should remain at that level, which is

23

$20 per kilogram.

24

25

really, of the jet engine.

Now, you wonder why, after all these

and I submit to you it is because of the advent,
Planes today can carry

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

efficiently much heavier cargo, and because the limit is

2

based on weight, the weight of a heavy shipment will

3

give that shipper sufficient protection.

4

So that if -- For example, Italians ship shoes

5

from Italy to the United States, and the Warsaw limit is

6

almost always in excess of the value of the cargo of

7

those shoes.

8

very high value shipment, gold or diamonds, that all

9

other shippers everywhere should not have to participate

The feeling is that if you are shipping a

If you are

11

shipping very valuable cargo, you should pay an extra

12

premium, and you can dc that by declaring an excess

QUESTION;

15

Could TWA by contract, by its

16

contract, given all the limitations of the treaty and

17

the statutes, have provided that liability should net be

18

beyond the declared value of the shipment?
MR. ROMANS;

19

No, Your Honor, because the

20

Warsaw Convention includes in its provisions an Article

21

23, which says any agreement leading to a lower price is

22

void.

23

say to a shipper, we are going to make your limit less,

24

25

That is part of the floor.

QUESTION :

Did you say what the declared value

1

was here, or was there one?

2

HR. ROMANSs

There was no declared value.

3

There is just one other main point that I

4

would like to say, and that is that the last official

5

price cf gold is being used today by the United States

6

when it makes payments to the World Bank. The United

7

States is obligated to make its payments to the World

8

Bank in United States gold dollars, but those gold

9

dollars for all practical purposes of this argument are

10

the same as the French gold francs.
They are a unit of liability, and the United

11

States as late as December 1,

18

is the preferred conversion factor.

14

In treaty interpretation, the overriding

imperative for the courts is tc give effect to the

16

intention of the parties, and in doing so it is

17

necessary to take a liberal and, one might say,

18

sympathetic approach to discerning the intent of the

19

parties.

20

yet the Court should go the last mile tc discern that

intent and to give it reasonable effect.

ORAI ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. FOSTER, ESQ.,

15

NR. FOSTER;

16
17

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice,

may it please

the Court.
This case is a perfect example of an issue

18

which should be resolved by the other branches, but

19

which by default has become a judicial problem, and a

20

consequence of that fact is that no matter what this

21

Court decides, the decision is going to be to some

22

extent unsatisfactory.

23

Now, before the Circuit Court, four possible

24

ways of interpreting Article 22 were presented.

The

25

Circuit Court held that as to each possibility, there

24
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

were powerful, devastating arguments against each.

The

2

Second

3

a fifth course of action, and the government and TWA

4

have been quick to point out the problems with that

5

solution to the problem.

Circuit's resolution of the problem was to choose

Franklin-Sint*s position is that the gold

6
7

franc in Article 22 can best be converted into United

8

States dollars by reference to the free market value of

9

gold at the time when the contract of carriage was

10

breach ed.
If the Court is unable to accept that

11
12

conversion interpretation,

the second best option is to

13

adopt the conclusion reached by the Second Circuit,

14

namely, that a political question is involved in making

15

a decision as to the proper conversion factor, and that

18

that decision really belongs to the other branches and

17

not the judiciary.
Now, Franklin Hint’s position that the free

18
19

market price should be used really rests on three

20

grounds.

21

Stevens was pointing out, the text of the treaty.

22

treaty says 65 and a half milligrams of gold, and what

23

Franklin Mint says is that in this case the cargo should

24

have been delivered on March 26th, 1979.

25

The first is, going back to what Mr. Justice

Well, the treaty also expressly

4

refers, does it not, to conversion to a national

5

6

MR. FOSTER*

7

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
And at the time the treaty was

8

adopted, that was clearly thought in this country to

9

refer to the official rate of gold, was it not?

10
11

MR. FOSTER*

Well, yes, Your Honor.

The issue

is —

12

QUESTION*

You are just unhappy because the

13

free market has changed so much and the Par Value

14

Modification Act was repealed, but I don't see how that

15

alters the intent of the drafters of the treaty at the

16

time it was done.
MR. FOSTER;

17

Well, at the time that the treaty

18

was drafted, Your Honor, there really wasn't a conflict

19

between an official price and a free market price,

20

because they were for all intents and purposes one and

21

the sa me.

22

QUESTION;

All right, but there certainly was,

23

before the repeal of the Par Value Modification Act,

24

there was quite a disparity, and nobody was objecting to

25

the Warsaw Convention official rate price.

26
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

HR. FOSTER

Well, yes and no, Your Honor

2

What happened is that following 1968, when they went

3

into this two-tier system, and there was a divergency

4

between the official price and the free market price,

5

starting in the early seventies, people started to say,

6

how do we resolve this problem, and the Montreal

7

Protocols that Mr. Romans mentioned was one way of

8

resolving this problem.
So, yes, you are entirely correct in saying

9
10

that when the Par Value Modification Act was passed, the

11

problem was well known, but it was also something that,

12

although not raised in the context of the Par Value

13

Modification Act, was felt to be a major problem that

So TWA knew that they had a valuable cargo.

6

The second point is, to answer your question -

7

8

Franklin Mint didn’t want to pay anything but the base

rate.
MR. FOSTER;

to Justice O’Connor’s reason, the reason for that is

the case -- in the context of cargo, because this case

2

comes down to basically a dispute between the insurance

3

companies.

4

international transportation, the only person that isn’t

5

insured by and large are passengers, and that also has

6

to be seen in the context of the history of the

7

convention, because when the convention was drafted in

8

1929 -- well, Lindberg crossed the Atlantic in 1927,

9

Earhart did it in 1928.

10

No in the context of passengers, because in

Anyone who was flying planes had to be crazy,

11

and certainly knew what the risk was, and one of the

12

changes that has occurred since 1929 is, people

13

willy-nilly hop on a plane to Montreal and don’t knew

14

that the liability regime is drastically different than

15

if they hop on a plane to go skiing in Colorado.

16

So, the really — the real party with exposure

17

in this situation are the passengers, and they are bound

18

by the same gold franc unit, although the limits are

19

different than cargo.

20

In addition to the text of the treaty, the

21

Franklin Nint’s argument in favor of the free market

22

value is also supported by the intent of the drafters.

23

Now, the drafting minutes for the Warsaw Conference of

24

1929 are reproduced, the pertinent parts, in the Joint

25

Appendix starting at Page 158.

29
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

And what that shows is that goinq into the

2

final conference, the drafters had a limit based on a

3

gold franc, and that has to be also seen in the context

4

of the time, because prior to World War One, most of the

5

major currencies were on a gold standard.

6

during

9

where people had to have a bushelful of Reichsmarks just

to buy a loaf of bread.
So, during the twenties, when the conference

was being drafted, they knew the currencies could be

14

what they took was international value.

So, it was recognized then that the limit

2

has to be based on a gold value.
In the mid-1950's, there were a series of

3
4

conferences to revise the Warsaw Convention, and in the

5

Hague Protocol in

11

which said, "Conversion of the sums into national

12

currencies other than gold shall in case of judicial

13

proceedings be made according to the gold value of such

14

currencies at the date of the judgment."
So, it was recognized in the mid-fifties that

15
16

we are talking about gold, and in fact when the

17

discussions leading up to the Hague Protocol were being

18

made,

19

argument for why they didn't have to increase the limit

20

of liability the fact that the limits on gold had

21

increased, and that therefore there was no reason to

22

increase the number of gold francs because the increase

23

in the value of gold had taken care of the problem.

24
25

the airlines themselves were offering as an

the intent of the

drafters supports the use of a gold value.

31

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

And the final point is the practice in the

2

United

States.

From 1934,

when the United States

3

adhered to the convention, until the present time, there

4

has been no question that a gold value has to be used.

5

What has happened is that the price between the free

6

market value and the official price has -- there has

7

been a wide divergence, and the official price has now

8

disapp eared.
The airlines were given a subsidy in 1929 in

If you take special drawing rights or $42.22

8

per gold, what you are doing is changing that gold

7

clause into a currency clause, and that is most clearly

8

the case in the special drawing rights, because a

9

special drawing right is just an average of five

10

currencies, and what happens then is, a claimant's

11

recovery rises or falls based on what happens to those

12

curren cies.
What the drafters of the convention intended

13
14

was that the recovery be tied to gold.

15

although still the case, is the situation if you use

16

$42.22.

17

by taking a price, fixing it in time, what that means

18

is, from here on in, a claimant's recovery rises or

19

falls based on the value of $42.22, and not anything

20

dealing with gold, and it was again, as I said, the

21

drafters’ intention to have it tied to gold.

22

Less clearly,

That was the last official price of gold, and

Now, Franklin Nint’s position is that Article

23

22 can be interpreted consistently with the text and the

24

intent of the convention’s drafters by using the free

25

market price of gold.

there will be a trial or a finding o n damages,

What are

Well, that's — I mean, the

theoretical possibility that, say, Franklin Hint is

18

bound by the amounts stated for Customs purposes, which

19

could be lower than the amount of the limit using the

20

free market value, but — in other words, if the free

21

market value limit is f80,000, and Franklin Hint's

22

damages are $67,000 because of the Customs value, then

23

the Court would have to take the lower amount.

24
25

Now, the reason why I say that the Second
Circuit's decision is the second best option is because

changes in the nature of gold in our system, the Article

1978, given the

11

branches to resolve the problem, because the problem

12

here is, if you take SDK's, if you take $42.22 an ounce,

13

you are changing the basic nature of Article 22 from a

gold clause into a currency clause, and that isn't

MR. FOSTERS

QUESTIONi

7

Well, Your Honor, because -You haven't really talked about

that.
MR. FOSTER:

8

— first of all, the CAB order

9

that Mr. Romans referred to was promulgated during the

10

time when there was an official price of gold, and what

11

happened was, as the official price of gold would

12

periodically change, the CAB would come out with an

13

order saying, this is what the new limits are.
The CAB itself has really been — there are

14
15

internal memoranda discussing what they should do with

16

the problem, and one of the documents in the Joint

17

Appendix which was originally presented by Mr. Romans

18

was a memorandum in which the writer said,

fiction, namely, the $42 figure," and that is at Page

It goes on to say that the best thing to do is

3

get together with State, with Treasury, with

4

Transportation, and let them worry about it, because the

5

CAE is going out of business, and it will be up to them

6

to resolve the matter in the future.
In a later order, and that is CAB Order

7
8

81-3-143, which is in the Joint Appendix before the

9

Second Circuit, the CAE in an order dealing with SDR's

10

dropped a footnote and said, and this order was in 1981,

11

"We don't indicate by this order any views as to what

12

the value of the gold franc in the convention is."
So, there is really, as the Second Circuit

13
14

said,

15

law of inertia as opposed to any concrete policy

16

decision, just simply because they recognize that the

17

CAB is going out of business, in essence, and other

people are going to have to worry about it, and quite

that the infant airline industries are no longer infants

MR. FOSTER*

Yes, Your Honor, and in fact in

the Airline Deregulation Act, they said -- they

expressed a strong policy argument in favor of free

Just to conclude, I would point out that the

problem here is the fact that you have a convention

20

is trying to cram 1929 language into the realities of

21

the 1980’s.
