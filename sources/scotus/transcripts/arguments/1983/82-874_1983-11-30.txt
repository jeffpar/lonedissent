ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. GARVEY, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. DUNLAVEYi

Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Courts
Section 1252 of the Judicial Code provides

9

Thank you.

that any party may appeal to this Court from a decision

10

by a court of the United States holding unconstitutional

11

an act of Congress.

12

the Government must appeal to this Court in a case where

13

it concedes that the statute is unconstitutional and the

14

only issue is the question of what relief should be

15

provid ed.

16

The issue in this case is whether

The statute in this case is Section

17

211(a)(5)(A) of the Social Security Act, which deals

18

with self-employment income from a family business in

19

community property states.

20

that if a family business is not run as a partnership

21

then for purposes of old age, survivors and disability

22

insurance all the income from the business shall be

23

attributed to the earnings account of the husband,

24

unless the wife is able to shew that she exercised

25

substantially all the management and control of the

busine ss
In 1980 the Attorney General determined that

3

that presumption made in that section was

4

unconstitutional and informed Congress that he would not

5

defend on appeal a case called Becker against Califano,

e

which had held that section unconstitutional.

7

Three weeks later Respondent filed this action

8

on behalf of a class of affected wives in community

9

property states.

The Government acknowledged in the

10

district court that the section was unconstitutional and

11

did not defend it.

12

entered judgment on the uncontested issue of liability

13

and held the section unconstitutional.

So the district court shortly

14

Thereafter and until now, the only issue in

15

this case has been what relief should be provided for

16

that deficiency in the statute.

17

in the district court that, since the invalid provision

18

was simply an exception to Section 211(a), the general

19

rule applying in the 42 non-community property states,

20

that what the district court should do was what was done

21

throughout the rest of the country.

22

the family business wasn't run as a partnership then all

23

the income should be attributed to one spouse or the

24

other without the use of any presumption, after a

25

determination of which one was chiefly responsible for

The Government proposed

running the business.
The district court disagreed and held, among

2
3

other things, that in community property states the

4

income should be divided between husband and wife

5

according to the amounts of their labor in the

6

business.
The Government appealed to the Court of

7
8

Appeals, which dismissed in a one-sentence order saying

9

it didn't have jurisdiction because cf Section 1252, and

10

the Government then petitioned this Court for a writ of

11

cer tio rari .
Cur position can be summed up briefly in two

12
13

points:

number one, only an appeal from the

14
15

constitutional issue can bring a case tc this Court;
t
number two, the question of relief in this case is not

16

part of the constitutional issue.

17

Let me begin with the first of those points.

18

Only an appeal from the holding of unconstitutionality

19

can bring the case to this Court under Section 1252.

20

It's important to recognize at the outset that Section

21

1252 is a unique jurisdictional provision.

22

section what Congress did was to pick out from the whole

23

universe of cases that customary go from the district

24

courts to the Court of Appeals a few unique cases which,

25

because of their great importance, were thought to

warrant extraordinary treatment and immediate review in

2

this Court.

3

The extraordinary treatment is, first of all,

4

tat they’re within the mandatory appellate jurisdiction

5

of this Court; but in addition, they leapfrog over the

6

Courts of Appeals. . And unlike even cases coming to this

7

Court under Section 1253, they haven’t had the benefit

8

of review even by three district judges by getting

9

here.
The reason Congress did this, in the words of

10
11

the sponsor of the bill which became Section 1252, the

12

reason was this.

13

ridiculous that the final determination as to the

14

constitutionality of an act of Congress be held in

15

abeyance for two or three years and nobody knows whether

16

or not it is constitutional."

Hr. Garvey, do you propose to shift

at some point in your argument from the statement cf the

sponsors to the language of the statute?
MR. GARVEY;

21

Indeed I do.

I intend to turn

Let me, if I may, just finish this

The House report on the bill said that its

This is not

5
6

point,

it does not even involve a constitutional issue.

7

At most what it involves is something like a question of

8

statutory intent.

9

than a simple question about whether the district judge

10

properly exercised her equitable discretion in providing

11

a remedy for a conceded unconstitutional provision in

12

the statute.

At worst, it involves nothing mere

Those are like the questions that the Courts

13

of Appeals address every day.

15

questions of extraordinary importance that Congress

16

determined should come immediately to this Court.

QUESTION*

I suppose some issues, although not

constitutional ones, can be as important in other ways.
HR. GARVEY*

That is certainly so.

There are

22

many questions of statutory construction that are mere

23

important than some of the kinds of questions that can

24

come to this Court under Section 1252.

25

Section 1252 does not turn on the importance of the

Nevertheless,

1

question, but on whether an act of Congress has been

2

held unconstitutional.
Now, what the statute provides — and we have

3
4

reproduced it at page 2 of our brief.

5

provides is, in the first paragraph it addresses what

6

should be done with appeals from the holding of

7

unconstitutionality.

8

addresses what should be done with other issues.

In the second paragraph it

The first paragraph saysz

9

What the statute

"Any party may

10

appeal

to the Supreme Court from a judgment, decree or

11

order by a court of the United States holding an Pet of

12

Congress unconstitutional in any civil action to which

13

the United States is a party."
Now, there are two ways in which that, in

14
15

which

the language in that first paragraph, can be

16

read.

17

sense in light of what Congress had in mind in providing

18

this extraordinary review mechanism.

But I would suggest that only one of them makes

19

One way of understanding that language is that

20

any party may appeal from any issue that is decided in a

21

judgment or order along with the issue of the

22

uncenstitutionality of an Act of Congress.

23

of looking at the judgment or order is that it's a kind

24

of grab bag and, provided the issue of

25

unconstitutionality is in there, a party is entitled to

So one way

1

take any other issue up to this Court, even if the

2

unconstitutional question is not brought to this Court.

3

So for example, if in this Court in the same judgment in

4

which

5

unconstitutional it had also denied attorney's fees to

6

the plaintiff, this grab bag interpretation of the first

7

section would entitle the plaintiff to bring up to this

8

Court the question of her entitlement to attorney's

9

fees, even though the constitutional question is not

Or, to take another example, if in the same

11
12

judgment the district court had decided a pendent

13

question of state law and nobody was interested in

14

appealing the holding of unconstitutionality, this grab

judgment?

What kind of

A final judgment holding any Act of

MR. GARVEY;

8
9

particular kind of final judgment.

And if the final judgment

As I said, the language and the

syntax of that paragraph will support that reading.

I

10

suggest that that reading doesn't make a lot of sense in

11

light cf what Congress had in mind in adopting that

12

section, and that there is another reading which can be

13

given to it, which is that the first paragraph is

14

entitled to authorize only appeals from the holding cf

15

unconstitutionality, that that is the issue which brings

16

the whole case to this Court and that's an essential

17

prerequisite for getting the case up here under the

18

first

4

paragraph.

19

QUESTION;

21

MR. GARVEY;

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. GARVEY;

24
25

Mr. Garvey, did the United States

No,

we did not.

Was that a conscious decision?
I don't know whether it was a

conscious decision or not.
That interpretation of the first paragraph of

10

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Section 1252 I think, is, the interpretation we propose.

2

is supported by the language of the second paragraph,

3

because what the second paragraph says is that once this

4

notice of appeal, which I think is this proper Section

5

1252 notice of appeal, is filed, the second paragraph

6

tells you what to do with the ether issues in the case.
It says if any of these issues have been taken

7

8

to other courts — that is to say, to the Court of

9

Appealss — prior to the filing of the proper Section

10

1252 notice of appeal to this Court, they shall be

11

treated as taken directly to this Court -- that is to

12

say, they will be transferred from the Court of Appeals

13

to this Court -- when the holding of unconstitutionity

14

is brought here, so that the whole case can be decided

15

tooether.

16

It also says in the first paragraph that the

17

party who has received a notice of appeal under this

18

section shall take any subsequent appeal or cross-appeal

19

to the Supreme Court.

20

direction is, in the example that I gave earlier, if the

21

winning party is sitting around drafting her notice of

22

appeal on the question of attorney's fees to the Court

23

of Appeals, where it would go but for an appeal to this

24

Court on the question cf unconstitutionality, the first

25

sentence says that she ought instead to file the notice

Now, the reason for that

11

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

of appeal to this Court because the appeal on the

2

constitutional question has brought the case here.
QUESTION;

3

Suppose, Mr. Garvey,

that you have

4

the whole range.

You have a decision on

5

constitutionality,

6

bring the case directly here, but that there were also

7

some remedial factors and some attorney's fees.

8

there any statute that would prevent this Court, after

9

it had decided the constitutional question, to remand

which would clearly in your view

Is

10

the case for a determination, for an examination by the

11

Court of Appeals of the other two questions that were

12

not constitutional?

13

decide all the issues?

Or would this Court be required to

I don't believe this Court would be required

14
15

to decide all the issues.

16

second

17

to this Court is that in the ordinary case the party

18

bringing them up won't yet have had a chance to have

19

them reviewed and Congress didn't want those issues

20

being decided simultaneously with the decision on the

21

constitutional question in this Court so that

22

inconsistent results might be reached.

23
24
25

I think the reason why the

paragraph directs the other issues to be brought

But the procedure you.suggest wouldn't result
in possible inconsistencies in the determinations.
QUESTION;

But one way or another, the parties

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

would te entitled to review of the district court in

2

some way?
MR. GARVEY &

3

Yes, they would.

The second

4

paragraph, by leapfrogging over the Court of Appeals,

5

deprives those parties appealing on other issues of

6

their usual right to have at least one appeal in the

7

Court of Appeals.
Sell, that is our first point, that only an

8
9

appeal from the holding of unconstitutionality can bring

10

the case, although it brings the whole case, to this

11

Court under Section 1252.
Our second point is that the question of

12
13

relief in this case is not a part of the holding of

14

unconstitutionality.

15

issue of relief here is an intrinsic aspect of the

16

holding of unconstitutionality.

17

I think a couple of examples ought to make clear.

Respondent has maintained that the

But that is not sc, as

18

Suppose that what the district court had done

19

in this case after holding the statute unconstitutional

20

was to adopt the approach the Government suggested.

21

Suppose the district court had concluded that, because

22

this exception to the general rule in Section 211(a) was

23

invalid, that it ought to apply the basic rule in

24

Section 211(a) that applies in non-community property

25

sta tes .

13

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

If Respondent, plaintiff in the district

court,

3

Respondent would not he able to contest the holding of

4

unconstitutionally* having prevailed on it in the

5

district court.

6

unconstitutionality of Section 211(a)(5)(A), would have

7

no interest in contesting it in this Court, and yet the

8

appeal

9

had appealed that issue of relief to this Court,

And the Government, having conceded the

would be brought directly here.
Or to take an even more extreme example,

10

suppose the district court had gone a step further and

11

actually -- suppose this were an individual action.

12

Suppose the district court had gone a step further and

13

actually recomputed the Respondent’s earnings account.

14

Suppose that on the basis of that recomputation the

15

district court had concluded that. Respondent was

16

entitled to collect $200 in old age benefits under the

17

Social Security Act, and suppose that Respondent

18

believed she was entitled to collect $205 a month.

19

If relief is in fact an intrinsic part of the

20

holding of unconstitutionality, Respondent would be

21

entitled to bring to this Court her disagreement with

22

the district court about the additional $5 a month,

23

notwithstanding that again she couldn't contest the

24

holding of unconstitutionality, having prevailed on that

25

issue in the district court.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Or, to take just cne more example, suppose the

2

district court had done what it did in this case and

3

said that the income was to be divided between husband

4

and wife, but that the district court had declined to

5

recompute earnings accounts back, to 1950 because, the

6

court might say, some wives are going to be better off

7

under those earnings accounts, under the earnings

8

accounts of their husbands, than they will be under the

9

new standard, and we don't want to disturb their

10

reliance interests; and some husbands are going to be

11

deprived of benefits if we recompute.

12

make this prospective.

13

this Court there would be no question about the

14

unconstitutionality of Section 211(a)(5)(A).

15

So we'll just

Once again, when the case got to

How, what these examples show, I think, are

16

two things.

17

18

question whatever.

20

determined by the Constitution.

What they show first of all is that there

What's more, the type of relief that the

district court chose, the one cf those three that I

suggested or another one, the one that it chose, the

type of relief that the district court chose might in

2

Congress would prefer it to apply, given the

3

unconstitutionality of Section 211(a)(5)(A), which

4

everybody concedes.

5

court’s decision on the question of relief, unlike its

6

decision on the question of unconstitutionality, may

7

very well be quite consistent with the wishes of

8

Congress.
QUESTIONS

9

That means that the district

But I take it it was not consistent

10

with the Government’s arguments there as to what the

11

intent of Congress was.
HE. GARVEY:

12

Indeed not.

But whether or not

3

it is inconsistent with the wishes of Congress is

4

something that at this point we don’t know, whereas its

5

holding on Section 211(a)(5)(A) we do know is

6

inconsistent with what Congress wanted, because wrote

7

that into the statute and the district court said that

8

statute is invalid.
So the question of relief may very well be

consistent with what Congress wanted to do, and in that

case I

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

things and one of them was that the case didn't really

2

involve any question of unconstitutionality; in fact, it

3

really involves a question of what Congress would want

4

to do, or maybe what it involves is a question about

5

equitable discretion.

I gave the district court took account of the reliance

equitable approach is to protect their interests by

11

Those kinds of decisions about what Congress

12

had in mind, about the equitable — about the reliance

13

interests of people who are already collecting benefits,

14

are the kinds of questions that the Court of Appeals

15

decids every day in cases of statutory construction, in

16

cases where — in other cases involving issues about the

question of relief is quite unlike the impact of the

And I presume because the Government

QUESTION;

You say you presume.

Certainly our

summary action doesn't explain it, does it?
MR. GARVEY;

18

No, your summary action does not

19

explain it, although it does note that the dismissal is

20

for lack of jurisdiction.

21

I would also suggest, Justice Stevens, that it

22

may be, with the less frequent use of three-judge courts

23

nowadays, that the question may be one of more

24

significance in future cases than it has been in the

25

past.

We suggested in our reply brief that the question

18

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

might come up in the wake of this Court's decision in

2

INS against Chada about questions of severability, which

3

we say are really no different from the question of

4

relief involved in this case.

5
6

7

So it is one which I think has not only arisen
in the past, but may reoccur with some frequency.
Let me make just one last point.

The question

8

in this case is not whether this Court should review the

9

question of relief or not.

The question in this case is

10

whether this Court should immediately review the

11

district court’s decision on the issue of relief,

12

because we presume that if an appeal were taken to the

13

Court of Appeals and the impact of the relief really

14

were severe and it really was fairly clear that the

15

relief chosen was not the one that Congress would have

16

preferred, that certiorari is always available from the

17

Court of Appeals' decision on the question of relief

18

under Section 1259(1).

19

So the question is not whether this Court

20

should review it; it's whether it should review it

21

immediately, rather than after having the benefit cf the

22

Court of Appeals' determination.

23
24
25

If there are no further questions, I'd like to
reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEEJ

Very well.

MR. DUDOVITZ i

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Courts
The issue before you today involves both

determining the parameters of the appeals to this Court

8

as well as appeals to the Court of Appeals under Section

9

1291.

10

As the Government has acknowledged, the

11

federal district court in this case did hold a federal

12

statute, Section 211(a)(5)(A) of the Social Security

13

Act, unconstitutional.

14

constitutionally adequate relief to the class members

15

whose rights were violated.

It also went forward and awarded

21

protective appeal filed in this Court.

22

Eut they filed that notice of appeal
There was,

Section 1291, which sets forth the

23

jurisdictional parameters for the Court of Appeals, says

24

that the Court of Appeals may not have jurisdiction if

25

it's possible for there to be an appeal to this Court.

The operative word in the statute is the word "may".

2

you may appeal to this Court, then the Court of Appeals

3

loses its jurisdiction.

4

emphasized recently in its Donovan case, what that means

5

is is that there is only one place for you to go when

6

you're appealing from an order holding an Act of

7

Congress unconstitutional.

8

If

And as this Court has

The issue here then turns on whether or net

9

this case presents a situation where the place for the

10

Government to go if they had an appeal was this Court.

11

We believe that the requirements of 1252 are pretty

12

clear right on its face.

13

the commentaries have pointed cut, four basic

14

requirements, three of which — that it be from a

15

court,

16

party

17

not in issue in this case,

18

that the order being appealed from must be from a

19

holding that a statute is unconstitutional.

They talk about, as most of

proper

that it be a civil action, the Government be a
— are really not controversial and certainly are
and the fourth requirement,

Well, there's no doubt that the order of the

20
21

district court from which the Government appealed was in

22

fact such an order.

23

this case that their notice of appeal purports to be a

24

notice of appeal from that entire order.

says,

And it is important to recognize in

It simply

we're appealing from that final judgment where the

So that's something that the Government says can

It also applies to

to decide it.

Then could they decide it?

HR. DUDOVITZ:

I guess your question presumes

24

that it was proper for that case to get in the Court of

25

to say, if it was and then the Court of Appeals holds

QUESTION?

7

NR. DUDOVITZt

8

With regard to the relationship of the relief

9

As an appeal and not as a cert.
Not as a cert, that's correct.

to the constitutional question, I would point out that

10

the Government itself agrees, as they’ve noted on page 3

11

of thair reply brief, that the district court must

12

address the questions of relief as a consequence of

13

holding that statute unconstitutional.

14

something the court had to do.

15

That is

That was part of its job once it found that

16

statute unconstitutional.

And it seems to me that that

17

puts that issue as a predicate; that the predicate to

18

that issue therefore is the holding of

19

unconstitutionality, which therefore binds the

20

Government to do something.

21

problem that the court — excuse me — that Congress

22

wanted to bring to this Court.

23

going to be bound, when something was going to happen to

24

the Government as a result of holding the statute

25

unconstitutional. Congress wanted this Court to quickly

And that's the kind of

When the Government was

and promptly resolve that problem, to make sure that the

2

disruption to the Government was minimum.
Now,

3

the Government’s line here that they've

4

attempted to draw we contend just plainly doesn't fit

7

is no phrase or statement in Section 1252 that suggests

that the issues to be appealed must be the question of

constitutionality.

They are trying tc

QUESTION:

11

the statute on its face.

There

Certainly there are intimations in

the second paragraph, aren't there?
ME. DUDOVITZ:

12

There are, but it's very

13

different, Your Honor, from the kinds of language that

14

exist in the other direct appeal statutes,

15

more about the kinds of issues, such as 1257 and

16

And it's also very different from the earlier

17

predecessor of 1252, which was repealed in 1925.

that talk
1254.

And in that earlier language, which the

18
19

Government cites in its cert petition at page 11, the

20

statute said that in any case that involves

21

constitutional construction or application of the

22

Constitution or in which the Constitution or the laws of

23

the U.S. are brought into question, that that's when you

24

bring a case up.

Now, the Congress didn't go back and

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

QUESTION;

But now take the second sentence of

2

the second paragraph on page 2 of the briefs

3

appeals or cross appeals taken to other courts prior to

such notice shall be treated as taken directly to the

5

Supreme Court."

"All

Now, that hypothesizes that appeals to the

7

Court cf Appeals by some party would have been proper in

8

the case of a judgment which held an Act of Congress

9

unconstitutional, don’t you think?

10

MR. DODOVITZs

Well, I contend and we have

11

argued that what that could very well be referring to is

12

in fact other kinds of appeals, such as interlocutory

13

appeals, which may have been appropriate in the Court of

14

Appeals prior to the holding of the Act being

15

uncons titutional.

16

The real import of the entire second paragraph

17

is to make sure that when this Court gets a case where

18

an Act has been held unconstitutional, it gets all

19

aspects of the case so that it has the power to

20

determine what should be done in this situation to make

21

a final and quick decision in order, again, to avoid

22

disruption to the Government.

23

QUESTIONS

That's certainly part of what the

24

statute is trying to do.

But another part, as your

25

opponent has suggested , is to select out a very few

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

cases that Congress felt deserved the Immediate

2

attention of this Court, and certainly the focus of

3

Congress was on the declaration of unconstitutionality.
MR. DUDOVITZj

4

Well,

I agree it’s very few

5

cases, and I can partly, I think, try to answer Justice

6

Stevens’ question about how many cases.

7

statute, which of course the Government has cited, which

8

requires the Attorney General to notify Congress when

9

they're not going to appeal from a holding of

10

There is a

uncons titutionality.
It's my understanding that in the years '81,

11

12

'82 and

13

two times where the Attorney General has so notified the

14

Government.

15

this case.

'83, subsequent to this case, there have been

16

That's other than the one time before in

We're not — this is one of those unique

17

cases.

There aren't very many times when this happens.

18

In fact, the Government itself points out the great

19

difficulty it always has in conceding the

20

unconstitutionality, that they rarely do that.

21

is a unique case.

22

any wa y..

So this

I don't think it’s a common case in

23

let me add, Justice Rehnquist, to one other

24

major reason I believe that the kind of line that the

25

Government wants to draw here in terms of

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

constitutionality doesn’t make sense, and that is

2

because it’s really premised on the theory that in

3

interpreting the statute this Court ought to be trying

4

to minimize its mandatory docket.

5

Now, whether or not we all think that that’s

6

something that ought to be done, the fact is that this

7

Court has held very explicitly that 1252 is not to be so

8

interpreted.

9

Court has held before, is to expand the mandatory docket

In fact, the purpose of 1252, as this

10

and not restrict it.

11

not view the language here with the idea of supporting

12

the minimizing of the mandatory docket, but rather with

13

the idea of what Congress desired.
QUESTION:

14

Ana therefore, the Court should

I don’t think our cases support

15

you.

16

that once Congress has decided

17

18

ought

19

If I understand your contention, you’re saying
to expand the mandatory

by passing a statute such as 1252, that statute
to be generously construed.
Now, I think that the whole history of the

20

three-judge court situation and appeals from three-judge

21

courts indicates that this Court recognizes when

22

Congre ss wants to increase cur mandatory docket, but it

23

doesn’t construe those statutes generously or

24

beneficently, or whatever you want to use, the term.

25

MR. DUDOVITZ:

I think this Court has

28
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

explicitly said, going back to the KcLucas case and in

2

the Grace Brethren Church case, that 1252 is not to be

3

construed in the same fashion as 1253, the three-judge

4

court.

It is separate —
QUESTION;

5

No, but what it said in NcLucas was

6

that it shouldn't be construed in the same way that the

7

three-judge court appeal statute was, where we held that

8

in order to have the appeal the three-judge court had to

9

have jurisdiction.

We said that wasn't required here.

10

3ut I don't think that really is the same thing as

11

saying we'll treat as broadly as possible the

12

substantive definitions of what can be appealed.
KR. DUDOVITZi

13

Well, I guess, Justice

14

Rehnguist, as I read those cases the Court has really

15

said that the basis for the 1253 cases was in fact

16

carrying out the principle of limiting the mandatory

17

docket of this Court, and as a result that 1253 was

18

going to be interpreted, if interpretation was

19

necessary, in a restrictive way.
On the other hand, the cases — and they go

20
21

back before these three-judge court cases.

The Reid

22

case,

23

Court specifically said, we're not going to take a

24

restrictive view of the word "party", we’re going to

25

take a more broader view of the word "party".

where the word "party" was interpreted; that the

1

Another — let me add a final point on what I

2

think are some problems with the Government's line

3

drawing, and that is I think it's very difficult to draw

4

that line and then make it consistent with the footnote

S

in the Regan case, where it says that an appeal by a

6

party who succeeded in the lower court on an issue which

7

the lower court found to be constitutional fits within

8

the first paragraph.

9

That is not an appeal on the issue for which

10

the court held unconstitutional at all, and in fact, as

11

the Government has pointed cut in its reply brief in

12

Regan,

13

because in order for the plaintiffs to get the relief

14

they wanted they needed to try to succeed on a different

15

issue.

the real reason for that appeal was relief,

They were really appealing relief.
And the Court didn't say that that issue ccmes

16
17

up under the second paragraph as a further appeal once

18

the Government made its appeal.

19

comes up under the first paragraph.

20

that more broad language.

21

consistent with what we're arguing here.

that is exactly the same as this case.

10
11

But

I don't believe

Probably we

wouldn't all be here if that were true.
But what Grace Brethren does, I believe, is it

follows a line of cases from this Court which indicates

13

the broader interpretation of what it means to hold an

Act of Congress unconstitutional.

22

Right.

That's all.

It didn't deal with

this question at all.
HR. DUDOVITZ;

What it does, I think, is it

23

follows from first the holding that you don't really

24

have to hold an Act of Congress unconstitutional; it can

25

be the Act applied, which is a much earlier line of

31

cases from the Fleming case.
And then — and I do think that it's taken at

2
3

least somewhat of a step further to say, not only dc you

4

not have to hold the Act itself unconstitutional, but in

5

fact if you held a state statute unconstitutional but it

6

effectively tied in the federal statute and affected the

7

operation of the statute program, the Federal Government

16

So it is not this

I wouldn’t disagree that it was

All I’m trying to suggest is that its

view of how to interpret 1252 is consistent, I believe,

with our view of how you interpret 1252.

Mr. Dudovitz, while you're pausing

21

let me just be sure I'm right about one assumption.

2

I would not.

I think what

3

comes here under my reading of the statute is relief

4

that is necessary to remedy the constitutional wrong.

The attorney fees relief doesn’t come from that.

really comes from a separate statutory basis.

your sort of plain language — you're not resting your

I would not rest solely on the

plain language.

I think even if you don't do the plain

a constitutional ruling.

HE. DUDOVITZ;

HR. DUDOVITZ;

I'm saying that I think you can

set that issue aside if you want to, because of the fact

that the relief doesn't flow directly as a remedy for

2

the constitutional violation.
Let me finally turn to one other point which

3

the Government has requested here to this Court which I

4

want to address briefly, and that is they have asked

5

that, even if this Court determines that we are correct,

6

that the Court ought to vacate the district court's

7

order and remand to allow the district court to enter a

8

new judgment, from which a new notice cf appeal could be

9

filed, and therefore they could then appeal to this

10

Court and have the relief issues brought here.

11

We think that that is a particularly

12

inappropriate action for this Court to take should the

13

Court decide in our favor.

14

whether you do that or not is really an equitable kind

15

of decision and you must look at what the effects cf

16

that are and what actions of the Government ought to be

17

protected here.

18

I think the question of

First, the effects of it could be very

19

disastrous to the class members in this case, who are

20

old and disabled women who, as the district court noted,

21

are largely living on the social security benefits, some

22

of which they receive as a result of this, the district

court’s rulijig.

The district court's relief has been

The Government, while it sought a stay in the

1

2

district court, did not pursue the stay.

They did not

3

argue that having the relief implemented while this was

4

going on was going to be necessarily particularly

5

harmful to them.
So it seems to me that their failure to do

that,

the effect that this has on the class members, and

8

finally the fact that the Government didn’t take any

9

action which you ought to really protect, which Justice

10

Blackmun pointed out by his question, they didn't file a

11

protective notice -- and it seems to me after the

12

Donovan case, which you remember came down three or four

13

months before the final judgment in this case, that at

14

worst from the Government's position there were some

15

questions to be asked as to where an appeal ought tc

to me is not very onerous.

I think, than what happened in the Donovan case, where

what was left in effect was the ruling a statute was

unconstitutional when the Government thought the statute

was constitutional.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF

1

JOHN H. GARVEY, ESQ.,

2

ON REHALF OF PETITIONER

3
4

MR. GARVEY:

I just have three brief points,

if I may.

5

If I understand correctly what Respondent’s

6

counsel has said, essentially, unless they’re able to

7

win on this unlikely point regarding the first

8

paragraph, what this case all boils down to is whether

9

the relief in this case is constitutionally mandated.

10

That, as the examples that I gave showed and as all the

11

cases cited in our reply brief at page 3 to 5 indicate,

12

is simply not the case.
The second point I want to make is a rather

13
14

technical point in response to a concern by Justice

15

Rehnquist.

16

paragraph of 1252 Congress at least contemplated that

17

some kinds of appeals would be filed to the Court of

18

Appeals prior to the filing of what I have been calling

19

the proper Section 1252 notice of appeal.

20

You pointed out that under the second

Respondent in her reply brief indicated that

21

those prior appeals were probably appeals taken under

22

Section 1292(b) of the Judicial Code.

23

1292(b) was not enacted until 1958, so it’s unlikely

24

that they had 1292(b) appeals in mind.

25

In fact, Section

There were -- there was a narrow class of

8

There was a narrow class that Congress probably
mind as well, simply a question of who beat in

And the third point I want to make is that, if

9

we should lose the proper disposition of this case

10

should not be like the disposition of the Richland

11

County case.

12

Government's brief in this Court we conceded that we had

13

gone to the wrong court in taking our appeal to the

14

Court of Appeals and, as this Court said, the direction

15

in which we should have gone was clear under this

16

Court's precedents.

In the Richland County case, in the

17

In this case, by contrast, I think we had very

18

good reason for believing in Montana Contractors against

19

Kreps that the proper place for us to go was to the

20

Court of Appeals and not to this Court.

21

should be wrong about where we should have gone, at

22

least the proper disposition would be to remand to the

23

district court for entry of a fresh decree from which we

24

may take a proper appeal to this Court.

25

And so if we

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

It hasn't been argued, but I'm just suggesting a

2

rationale for requiring jurisdiction to be accepted by

3

this Court of Congress might have been that it did not

4

want the Attorney General to be able to concede the

5

unconstitutionality of statutes without this Court in

6

effect approving the concession, and that therefore they

the mandatory jurisdiction here, because it's

And that

10

perhaps underlies their requirement that you tell the

11

Congress whenever you do this.

12

KR. GARVEYs

That's conceivable, although I,

13

having

read the legislative history, have found no

14

indication of that.

15

General's choice to intervene or not in these cases is

16

discretionary, so that he may let go by a holding of

17

unconstitutionality without even getting involved.

the same position even more strongly if you had
