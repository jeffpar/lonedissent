CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

3

Mr. Varco, I think you

may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. VARCO, JR., ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

5

MR. VARCOi

6

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

7

please the Court, at issue today are two conflicting

8

claims.

9

sex discrimination in certain commerical associations,

On one hand, the states, that it can prohibit

10

and on

the other, the United States Jaycees, with a

11

constitutionally protected freedom of association,

12

permits it to engage in precisely that conduct.
In order to understand those claims, it’s

13
14

necessary that the facts of this case be made clear, and

15

I’d like to take a few minutes to do just that.

16

the Jaycees does, and what it offers, and how it treats

17

its members are essential to an understanding of this

18

case.

19

training and leadership skills and the opportunity to

20

obtain

21

indivi duals .

22

What

What the organization does is offer leadership

those skills and obtain that training to certain

It offers this training and these

23

opportunities in three types of programs.

24

type of program is the program in which the Jaycees

25

train an individual to better himself or herself.

3

The first

Such

1

programs would be learning how to be a better speaker.

2

A second type of program is a program that they call

3

management skills.

4

train people to run meetings, to run programs.

5

type of program that the Jaycees runs and provides

6

opportunities for leadership training in are programs

7

which merge those first two types of skills, but which

8

work toward the betterment of the community, so that,

9

for example, an individual Jaycee learns these

That indicates that the Jaycees
A third

10

individual skills, learns hew tc run a program, and then

11

runs a program for the betterment of their community.
These programs are made available through some

12

13

7,000 local chapters by a national organization, and

14

they're run on a local basis in local communities.

15

unfortunate part, from the State’s point point of view,

16

about these programs is that women have admission to the

17

leadership training opportunities that are provided, but

18

they're on a limited basis.

19

these organizations is that they cannot vote, they

20

cannot hold office, and they cannot receive any of the

21

awards that the Jaycees give for performance in these

22

progra ms.

23

The

What women cannot do in

Thus, what happens is the Jaycees can buy part

24

of this program — female Jaycees can buy part of this

25

program, but they can't buy all of it.

4

Now, the Jaycees have pictured themselves as a

1

2

private membership organization, and I think it's

3

essential to understand that they really operate the way

4

a business operates.

5

headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma have a marketing

6

department, a department that’s designed to shape and

7

promote the Jaycee image.

8

and had a budget of some $2 million.

9

that,

10

For example, their national

In 1980 this had 40 employees
In addition to

they have a membership development department that

creates these programs that I referred to you about.
In the 1980 Annual Report the Jaycees referred

11
12

to tfcese programs as some among the most useful that

13

they have in getting career opportunities and new jots.
Another indication of the business aspect of

14
15

this community — of this organization — is the way in

16

which

17

had a membership of some 295,000 members;

18

of those members had been recruited the previous year.

19
20

the Jaycees recruit.

QUESTION;

For example, in 1980 they
120 to 130,000

Well, what does that — how does

that bear on any of the issues in this case?

21

MR. VARC0;

22

QUESTION*

23

MR. VARCC:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice -How they get their numbers?
I think what it shows is that it

24

operates the way a business operates.

25

and seek customers. They go cut on a continuous basis to

5

Businesses go out

1

look for people to buy their products.

2

what the United States Jaycees does in this case.

3

They’re continually locking for new people to bring into

4

their organization.

5

QUESTION*

Well, that’s true of social

6

fraternities, too.

7

rushing.

8

that make them a business organization?

Fraternities are constantly

They want a new pledge group every year.

MR. VARCOs

9

That’s precisely

No, I don't think it does.

Does

I

10

think that in a fraternity, for example.

11

Justice Rehnquist, you have a situation in which there

12

are ties that bind the members which are significantly

13

different than the ties that bind the people in the

14

Jay cee s.

15

QUESTION;

#

Well, there may be those

16

differences, but I think one of them is not a — there

17

is not a difference between their desire for new members

18

at frequent intervals.

19

MR. VARCCs

Well,

I bring that point out tc

20

show that that’s one of the aspects of their business.

21

I think some clubs, for example, some private social

22

clubs don't show this rush that fraternities do.

23

They're very discreet and private, there's no recruiting

24

that goes on, you have to know somebody to belong.

25

think that if we’re weighing the Jaycees on the spectrum

6

So I

1

of where they belong, the fact that they go out and seek

2

these people actively shows that they’re more like a

3

business and they work more like a business than they do

4

like a private social club.
QUESTIONS

5

Hell, an association of this kind

6

has one thing in common with a fraternity that was just

7

mentioned, in that the fraternity has access to these

8

people for about four years of undergraduate work, and

9

perhaps a little longer, and you have an age limit

10

here.

Is that not sc?

11

MR. VARCO;

12

QUESTIONS

13
14
15
16
17

•

MR. VARCO;

Yes, that’s correct.
And what is that age limit?
The Jaycees' programs are offered

to people between the ages cf 18 and 35.
QUESTIONS

Does that violate — does that

discriminate against older people?
MR. VARCO;

It certainly does, but in the

18

State of Minnesota that’s not illegal.

19

provision against age discrimination in the state.

20

is a form of discimination; it is a discriminatory

21

judgment that they make.

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. VARCO;

24

QUESTION;

25

There is nc
It

With that turnover -Fardon me?
With that age limit, there’s a very

substantial turnover in membership, is there not?

7

1

MR. VARCOi

I don't know if the record

2

indicates quite what their turnover is, Mr. Chief

3

J u s ti c e .
QUESTION!

4

You don’t need to know what the

5

record shows.

You just need to look at the numbers.

6

age 35 or 36, every year quite a few of them are going

7

out, aren't they?

8

MR. VARCO:

9

QUESTION*

Yes, that's correct.
Well, then in order to maintain an

10

organization, they've got to have a program at the

11

bottom side to bring new ones in, don't they?

12

MR. VARCO:

13

QUESTION:

MR. VARCO*

At

No question about that.
What's remarkable about that?
There's nothing remarkable about

But the reason I bring that point up —

QUESTION*

17

MR. VARCO:

18

QUESTION*

19

MR. VARCC:

Why does that it make it a businss?
Pardon me?
Why does that make it a business?
It’s a businesslike aspect to it.

20

In other words, I'm sure that there are some clubs that

21

we would all agree would be private, that dcn't engage

22

in this particular type of recruiting, and they lose

23

members quite regularly; I don't know if they replace

24

them on the same basis.

25

that they don’t.

I think we could hypothesize

Eut this club recruits aggressively.

8

1

It has a -- it refers to its new members as customers.

2

It solicits them in a way that business is solicited.

It goes cut into the marketplace and looks for --

QUESTION:

5

MR. VARCO:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. VARCO:

It recruits women, too, doesn't it?
Pardon me?
It recruits women, too, doesn't it?
The Minneapolis and St. Paul

8

chapters, in contravention cf the financial charter,

9

recruited women.

10
11

I don't think that the national

Jaycees recruits women.
QUESTION:

I thought you, in describing the

12

Jaycees at the outset, you said that women can be

13

limited members.

14

MR. VARCO:

15

several categories of members.

16

important are, for this case, are individual member

17

which is limited tc men between the ages of 18 and 35,

18

and associate members which is a category of membership

19

that women can have.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. VARCO:

22

The Jaycees, Justice White, have

Don't they recruit for them?
I don't believe that they dc.

don't believe that --

QUESTION:

WE. VARCO:

I would think they would be

That's one of their rights.
Again, I hate to fall back on what

6

the record says, but the evidence in our record

7

consisted of what the Minneapolis and St. Paul chapters

8

did, and it consists of a large number of materials

9

about how the national chapter operates.

10

The Minneapolis and St. Paul chapters

11

recruited aggressively for them because, of course, they

12

treated them equally.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. VARCO:

As members.
As individual members.

But there

15

is nothing in there, in the record, that shows how the

16

associate --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. VARCO:

19

QUESTION:

Regardless of how sensible -That's correct.
Would you agree that the core issue

20

in this case is not whether this is a good idea to

21

include or exclude women, but whether it is required as

22

a matter of law.

23
24
25

Is that not the issue in this case?

MR. VARCO:

I'd agree with the first half of

that formulation.
QUESTION:

What about the second half?

10

MR. VARCO*

1

Whether it’s a good idea or net

2

makes no difference to this Court.

5

otherwise valid state law.
QUESTION:

7

I think that the

whether the Jaycees have a

Or whether people who are not

members have a statutorily guaranteed right to come in.

8

MR. VARCO:

9

QUESTION*

Yes.

And in Minnesota they do.

Then why is the good sense of it

10

relevant one way or the other?

11

MR. VARCO*

I think the good sense of it is

12

particularly relevant.

17

It's simply a question of constitutional and

QUESTION:

I agreed with your first part of

There’s two organizations in the

two cities that thought it was a good idea.

MR. VARCO:

19

QUESTION*

Yes, they did.
But that has nothing to do, has it,

20

with whether -- with the legal question that's presented

21

here.

22

MR. VARCO:

No.

That only served as the

23

Petrie dish upon which this all grew.

24

this particular way in which the Jaycees treated their

25

female members.

11

It sprung from

1

The Jaycees’ grounds —

2

QUESTION;

Would the statute in your state be

3

applied to prevent a group of blacks from forming an

4

all-black club to advocate causes and interests to black

5

citizens, and compel that group to admit whites?
ME. VARCO;

6

I think. Justice O’Connor, it

7

would depend on several things.

8

analysis that you'd have to make, and I think there^s a

9

constitutiona analysis that you’d have to make.
QUESTION;

10

There is a statutory

If it were found to be as much of a

11

public accommodation as the Jaycees, then do you think

12

that there would be a First Amendment right of that

13

black association that would override any state

14

regulations?
ME. VARCO;

15

If the admission of whites tc this

16

black institution in your hypothetical could be shown to

17

interfere with some constitutionally protected freedom

18

— let’s say a constitutionally protected right to hold

19

a belief or to advocate a belief -- then the State of

20

Minnesota, I think, would have trouble requiring through

21

its public accommodations law that those people be -QUESTION;

22

Well,

dees the First Amendment

23

incorporate a right to advocate causes relating just to

24

young men?

25

MR. VARCO;

It probably does, Justice

12

1

O'Connor, but that freedom is not interfered with in

2

this particular case.

3

Minnesota imposes upon the Jaycees which requires them

4

to admit women would not ha ve the effect of interfering

5

with any position that the Jaycees takes on these issues

that purportedly concern yo ung men.

QUESTION;

I'm su re you tried to tell

Arnold, but he didn’t agree with you.

9
10

ME. VARCC;

11

QUESTION;

That' s correct.
What i f there were, in Minneapolis,

12

an Iranian society devoted to the propagation of Iranian

13

interests, and one of their big positions was that Iraq

14

is all bad?

15

comes along and says, well, these Iraqui people that

16

wanted to belong to the Ira nian society are free to join

17

it under our public accommo dations law.

18

them.

19

constitutional basis, and s ays, well lock, there's no

20

reason in the world why the Iranian society can't keep

21

on advocating gust what it always did;

22

bad.

23

enough

24

to quite substantially chan ge the purpose of the

25

organization.

And then the S upreme Court of Minnesota

You have to let

And then the State t ries to defend on a

that Iraq is all

And their answer, I s uppose, would be if you admit
Iraquis into the Ira nian society, they're going

13

1

Isn't that the same foreseeable here?

2

HE. VAECC;

No, it is not.

It's not

3

foreseeable at all, because the assumption in your

4

hypothetical, probably quite an accurate one, is that

5

the Iraquis would have a different point of view on that

6

war than the Iranians.

7

the two cases here is that the issues that the Jaycees

8

purportedly calls men's issues are not issues on which

9

sex determines your point of view, much the way — or to

10

the contrary of what happens in the Iran/Iraq situation.

11

In addition to that, the Jaycees hold up their

I think the difference between

12

membership to no politica litmus test the way the

13

Iraq/Iran hypothetical would.

14

divergent views.

15

Hen can hold these

They can hold --

QUESTION;

Well, these are factual assertions

16

about the character of this organization.

17

supposed to take your word for it, or how are these

18

things supposed to be sorted out?

19
20
21
22
23

MR. VAECO;

fire we

I think the record shows,

Justice White, that QUESTION;

Well,

apparently it didn't, or the

Court cf Appeals would have believed you.
MR. VARCO;

Well, the record shows that the

24

admissions practices of the Jaycees don't entail any ort

25

of agreement with a particular issue.

14

QUESTION:

1

Well/ at least the Court of Appeals

2

thought there was something in the notion that the

3

Jaycees were giving a male point of view, and that is

4

was distinguishable enough that the State couldn't force

5

them to take in women.
MR. VARCO:

6

7

I think that the Court of Appeals

made the erroneous assumption that because —

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. VARCO:

I know you --- men uttered something, that

10

that was a man's point of view.

11

way, that because men uttered it, men would hold

12

point of view and women wouldn't.

13

in the record that shows that.

14

contrary, what the record shows is that the Jaycees

15

don't require any particular political ideology.
A striking fact,

16

Or, to put it another
this

But there is nothing

And quite to the

I think, is that they don't

17

even require you to pass the test if you come in with

18

respect to the very issue that's here.
QUESTION:

19

Going back to Justice O’Connor's

20

question, what if the blacks decided that we should have

21

our own Jaycee, because we ought to really promote black

22

business participation in black businesses, and things

23

like that?

24

speak,

25

membership.

So they had an absolute carbon copy, so to

of the Jaycees, but they are all limited to black
They did exactly the same things, took

15

1

great part in community work, trained leadership,

2

e t ca t e ra .

3

MR. VARCO;

If there’s absolutely no

4

difference between the organization in your hypothetical

5

and the organization here, then I would say that they

6

could not do that.
QUESTION;

7
8

they’re all black.

9
10

MR. VARCO;

QUESTION ;

You mean under the Minnesota

Supreme Court of the matter and your view of the matter?

13

MR. VARCO;

14

QUESTION;

15

That would make no difference for

purposes of this application of this statute.

11

12

Well, the difference is that

That’s correct.
Under the Court of Appeals’ view,

they could do that, couldn't they?
MR. VARCO;

16

That’s correct.

But if we

17

accepted the

Court of Appeals’ view, I guess we wouldn't

18

be here.

disagree with them both on the law and

19

the facts.

20

We

QUESTION;

on

Is that because you're elevating

21

the type of speech involved to different levels of

22

protection?

The type of advocacy involved?

23

important in

one case than another?

24

there can be

no First Amendment advocacy right on

25

allegedly concerns of only male citizens?

16

Is it mere

Are you saying

that

MR. VARCO:

1

I'm looking at that question,

2

Justice O'Connor, from two points of view.

First, from

3

a factual point of view.

4

point of view is illustrated by Justice Rehnquist's

5

observations.

6

difference between the Iranian and Iraqui points of view

7

on this particular war.

And I think that the factual

There would be — there's a factual

8

In this case, what we disagree with is that

9

the entrance of women into the Jaycees will result in

10

any difference of opinion on the particular issues that

11

the Jaycees speaks on.

12

that,
QUESTION i

13

There simply is no basis fcr

Well, what if the Jaycees had taken

14

a posi tion that the Equal Rights Amendment is bad, and

15

that w omen getting into the job market is a bad

16

develo pmen t?

17

positi ons, which I am aware they have not, would that

18

cha nge you r answer to any of Justice O'Connor's

19

questi ons ?

20

Now, if they had taken those two

MR. VARCO:

I think what it would change would

21

be the nature of the regulation that the state could

22

impose upon them.

23

their organization people who disagreed with that

24

particular point of view, because that would then be

25

content regulation.

It couldn’t force them to take into

We'd be regulating the content cf

17

1

their beliefs
QUESTION;

2
3

But you say they still couldn't

just flatly ban women, is that right?
HR. VARCO:

4

That's correct.

It's obvious that

5

there are some women who probably agree with that point

6

of view.
QUESTION;

7
8

Is the government limited to

regulating only non-speech activities of an organization?
MR. VARCO;

9

For purposes of the First

10

Amendment and for purposes of analyzing this case, as

11

the jurisprudence cf this Court has progressed this far,

12

the answer is probably yes.
QUESTION;

13

There are two other areas

Well, does that mean if an

-»

14

organization did have both social non-speech activities

15

that it performed and certain advocacy functions that it

16

performed, that the state could relate just the social

17

non-speech activities within that organization?

18

MR. VARCC;

19

QUESTION;

20
21

It could certainly do that, yes.
Is that the effect of your state’s

law?
MR. VARCO;

In this particular case it is,

22

yes, because there is no regulation of content based

23

speech here.

24
25

What I was going to suggest is that the First
Amendment, while it protects not only content-based

18

1

speech, it also protects certain, private, intimate

2

gatherings.

3

is probably someplace in the concept of liberty, the

4

notion that the government shouldn't regulate certain

5

types of behavior that aren’t, while not intimate, are

6

nonetheless personal.

7

shouldn't be telling people who they have to go on

8

picnics with.

I think that as an extension of that, there

So, for example, the government

On none of those three bases, the content

9
10

base,

the privacy base, or this substantive due proces

11

base do the Jaycees fit in, because the relationships

12

that the people have here are simply too impersonal and

13

too commercial to be accorded any of those types of

14

protec tion.
QUESTION;

15

What about the occasion of voting,

16

for instance, in the organization on what political

17

positions the organization will take?

18

activity?

19

Is that protected

Not in this particular instance,

20

no, because voting is part of what you do as a Jaycee.

21

You take positions on issues.

It does.

The Jaycees, about once

the front of their annual report each year, and they are

requirement that the state puts on them through its

public accommodations statute, wouldn’t affect the

positions that the Jaycees takes on these particular

issues , because there is no sex-based link between the

issues.

Yes, but this organization doesn't

make its money solely off of dues.

If you look at their

10

annual report for 1980, I believe that their budget was

11

$4.2 million and only $2.6 of that came from dues.

12

rest of that money came from other sources, sales cf

The

And, Justice Stevens, the Ninnesota Supreme

15

Court did say it was a business and it offered its goods

17

and services to the public, but when it did it looked at

an extensive record which shows just how similar to a

business this organization is, viewing its members as

customers, selling and advertising the way a business

would.

respect, from the Kiwanis, the Rotary, and 29 other

Well, one thing that is —
They purchase the membership, in

your terms, for X dollars and pay so much every time

they attend a luncheon.

and others have referred to, very frequently they

Now, why is the Kiwanis Club or the Rotary
Club any different from the Junior Chamber of Commerce?
MR. VARCC;

Cne of the problems with this case

24

is that there is so much evidence about the Jaycees and

25

so little about precisely these clubs that you've

26

1

described.

And my suspicion is, is that the difference

2

between the Jaycees and these clubs is that there is

3

some degree of selectivity, something other than the

4

ability to spend money.
QDESTIONi

5

Selectivity in one sense, that it's

just one lawyer, so that he has a monopoly or a

potential monopoly cn that incoming business.
ME. VARCO;

Eut if there’s a privacy aspect

that has to be protected here, it’s protected because of

selectivity.

It’s because this organization is more

Well, at least they assert that

16

they’re selective in that they want only males between

17

the ages of 18 and 36 or something like that.

MR. VARCOi

18

That’s correct.

But by the same

19

token,

that simply is too big a pool to say, because

20

they exclude women, they’re not selective.

It’s too public a pool.

MR. VARCO;

If the Girl Scouts operate in the

probably be considered a public accommodation for

purposes of the Minnesota Human Rights Act.

MR. VARCO;

And the Boy Scouts, too.
That’s correct.
Well,

do you — the District Court

said that even if the Jaycees are interested in

that the state interest is compelling and overrides that

The United States Jaycees is not a business.

Is there some

Of the majority of -- they voted

Yes.

I think you have the power to

13

analyze the facts in making the constitutional inquiry

14

as to whether this organization’s right to free

15

association has been -- .

16

QUESTION:

Why don’t you just accept the fact

17

that within the meaning of the Minnesota statute, this

18

is a business?

19

But that doesn’t solve the case.

MR. HALL*

Well, if that were accepted, we

20

would abridge constitutional rights by just pure

21

imposition of labels.

22

QUESTION:

Why?

Why?

23

your constitutional argument.

MR. HALL:

meaning of the statute.
HR. HALL;

4

All it does

Cur point is the same as Judge

5

Arnold made, that the label "business" is simply a

6

distortion of the facts.
QUESTION;

7

Suppose it is.

The Minnesota

8

Legislature and the Minnesota Supreme Court can’t

9

determine the constitutional question here.

10

determine that issue, don't we?
MR. HALL;

11
12

Yes.

Eut — I’m sorry, I didn’t

follow your question.
QUESTION;

15

MR. HALL;

That’s correct.

16

QUESTION :

-- not the Minnesota Legislature or

17

the Minnesota Supreme Court.

18

MR. HALL;

That’s correct.

19

QUESTION;

Because the Supreme Court of

20

Minnesota says this is a business under Minnesota law.

21

That’s the last word on Minnesota law.
MR. HALL:

22

I’m not quarreling that the last

23

word on whether or not they label this a public -- that

24

label,

25

that that label does net preclude the constitutional

QUESTION:

Eight.

Cur position

But is it a fact that any

man between those ages is admitted?
ME. HALL:

Yes.

That is true, except for de

11

facto exclusion on a local basis where people tend to

12

admit people and recruit people, as in St. Paul, where

13

they’re primarily business.

14

be another way, and in Los Angeles it may be another,

15

where people tend to recruit people they have something

16

in common with.

17

But in New Orleans it may

But it is true that it does not have an

18

exquisite or exclusive method of recruitment.

19

all the decisions of this Court that have dealt with the

20

right of freedom association, to my knowledge, none cf

21

those cases have dealt with organizations that have had

22

highly selective or private club membership policies.

23

And there's nothing in the cases that we have seen that

24

indicate that an organization with this kind of a policy

25

could not enjoy that freedom.

40

However,

QUESTION;

1

Part of your submission is that the

2

First Amendment protects private organizations, whether

3

they’re communicative organizations or not.

4

fraternal organizations.
MR. HAIL;

5

Just

That is our position, although in

6

this case, there is bread communication of controversial

7

public issues.

QUESTION;

8
9

In this case, the -But none of which — none of which

you can identify that would be different if women were —
MR. HALL;

10

I can’t identify — if the

11

organization itself, it were required to comply with the

12

Minnesota injunction and admit women, it is

13

inconceivable -- and I think you’re rational to assume

14

that the organization won't change and that its

15

viewpoint won’t change.
QUESTION;

16
17

yet.

Anytime the membership --

Well,

I've asked about it several times.

MR. HALL;

MR. HALL;

Well, they've never voted on it,

but I can’t predict the issues —

23

QUESTION;

24

agree on it either.

25

MR. HALL;

Hew do you know?

All men don't

I can’t predict what the viewpoint

41

1

will be on any given issue that may come up next year or

2

the year after that.

3

QUESTION;

4

would be different?

5

MR. HALL;

But you just think it inevitably

I think an organization in which

6

you change the membership from one which is all men,

7

dedicated to voting the interests of men, and you change

8

it to an organization which also includes women, I think

9

it’s only rational to assume that that organization is

10

going to undergo a substantial change.
QUESTION;

11

But new, it seems to me that

12

there's something that has to depend on the nature of

13

the organization.

14

male stockbrokers that are solely concerned with the

15

business of stockbrokering and what's happening to

16

stockbrokering, and they’re required to take in women

17

stockbrokers, it seems to me that the great focus on

18

stockbrokering may be very little different between men

19

and women.

20

If ycu have an organization of all •

On the other hand, if you have an organization

21

of male chauvinists that says we're tried of this

22

affirmative action in favor of women, we want what we

23

think is a square deal, it seems to me there you get a

24

different thing.

25

But you haven't really shown.that the Jaycees

42

1

are in the latter category at all, that they espouse

2

anything close to men's rights or the kinds of issues

3

that men and women might feel differently about.
MR. HALL:

4

Well, the important point that I

5

think perhaps I haven't made clear is that this

6

organization's essential core purpose is to advance the

7

interests of young men, just as there are women's

8

organizations which central core purpose is to advance

9

women.

If you would require those women's organizations

10

to admit men, you're going to change the organization.

11

If you require this organization to admit women, I think

12

it's inevitable that you're going to essentially change

13

ist.
I think we have a constitutional right to have

14
15

an organization which just promotes the interests of

16

young men.

17

it becomes an orgnanization in which women are members,

18

that they're going to long stand for leaving the

19

organization with the sole purpose to advance the

20

interests of men.

21
22
23

And I don't think that we can expect that if

QUESTIONS

Aren't you just afraid that the

women will "take over"?
MR. HAIL:

Maybe that -- that may be a --

24

Judge Doyle of the Tenth Circuit suggested that may be a

25

possible fear, and if it is, I think it's the kind of

43

1

fear that would be legitimately protected by any group.

2

Women may keep out men for fear they'll take over.

3

think it’s a legitimate right to do so.
QUESTION;

4

I

Well, if the suffragette movement

5

of a century ago had taken in men, they probably

6

wouldn't have had the women's vote quite as soon as they

7

did, would they?
MR. HALLi

8

That's right.

And I think if wcmen

9

had been in this organization five years ago or even six

10

years age, they would not have been willing to spend the

11

kind of money this organization is spending to uphold

12

its constitutional right to be a men-only organization.
QUESTION;

13

Mr. Hall, I'm afraid we're not

14

giving you much chance to argue, but the Court of

15

Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in its holding paragraph

16

on page A2, says this;

MR. HALL;

No, he doesn't.

Rut he arrives at

the same conclusion by dictating who the membership, and

by dictating the membership you effectively determine

how that organization will — its collective voice and

its programs.

QUESTION;

I don’t think your opponent would

have said -- would say that his arguments all apply to a

19

situation where there was something called the National

20

Organization of Ken, that it anti-affirmative action,

21

anti-ERA, and so forth.

22

I think perhaps he would say the difference

23

between that case and ycur case is, you haven't shewn

24

that the Jaycees are the counterpart of NOW.

25

MR. HALL;

Yes.

It seems irrational to assume

49

1

that this organization, to continue as an all-male

2

organization, has to deliberately take positions on ERA

3

or abortion in order to show how anti-woman it is.

4

doesn’t seem to make sense that they can't have an

Don’t you think those were the

arguments that were made in those cases?

The same

argument you make.
MR. HALL*

11

In the public accommodation cases,

12

the right of freedom of association was not made, to my

13

knowledge, because they were no private associaticnal

14

characteristics involved in a restaurant or a motel, as

15

distinguished from this case where a local Jaycee

I notice in their brief that they filed

that there are 200,000 women and men in that
Apparently, they do take in men.

MR. HALL:

16

Yes.

As to those organizations,

17

the problem of admitting anyone to interfere with thir

18

fundamental underlying purpose has not been a problem.

19

Some of the organizations who have filed as amicus here,

20

however, do limit their membership to women, and

21

legitimately so, because those organizations feel that

22

they're promoting the interests of women, and if they

23

want to do that they should limit their organization to

24

women.

25

There are large organizations in this country

53

1

which do limit their memberships strictly tc women fcr
