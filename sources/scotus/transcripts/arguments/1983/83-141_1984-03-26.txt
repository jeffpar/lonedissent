MR. TRIBE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case tests the limits of federal judicial

2

intervention into the legislative and the judicial

3

processes of a state that has grappled since entering

4

the Union with a land oligopoly traceable to its

5

monarchy, very much as the original

6

struggled with large landholdings traceable to the

7

English crown.

8
9

13 colonies

Now, Hawaii’s legislature attacked that
problem by using eminent domain with fair compensation,

20

the approach that the Appellees themselves preferred for

2

federal tax reasons, but an approach that the U.S. Court

22

of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denounced as a

23

forbidden taking from one private party to benefit

24

another, as though the Land Reform Act somehow left the

25

land market of Hawaii itself completely unchanged and

merely substituted a favored group of lessees for the

2

Bishop Estate and ether supposedly disfavored owners as

3

the ruling oligopolists of the Hawaiian Islands.

4

New, I should like tc begin by shewing hew

5

wholly untenable that view is.

The Appellees talk

6

repeatedly, as did the Ninth Circuit, of appeasing the

7

desires for land owning of the landless majority.

8

think it will become clear, that radically distorts the

9

aims of the legislation before this Court.

As I

Eut it does, perhaps inadvertently, hit upon a

10
11

very fundamental truth, and that is that people

12

everywhere greatly prefer tc own not only the home they

13

live in and invest in and build, but also the land on

14

which

that home stands.
Now, of course there are unusual circumstances

15
16

-- and

17

lead a perfectly well functioning land market to

18

separate surface from subsurface ownership, to separate

19

the ownership of the heme on top of the land from the

20

ownership of what’s under the land.

21

his Court has seen seme cf them -- that might

Fcr example, in the case of Pennsylvania Ccal

22

against Kahon, where the land contained valuable

23

minerals, the perfectly natural development was for a

24

few large mining companies to end up owning the mining

25

rights under very large tracts of land, and selling only

1

surface rights to a large number of individual

2

homeowners.

3

But of course, in most places, both in the

4

continental United States and in Hawaii, a normally

5

functioning competitive market would never yield sc

6

bizarre a pattern, where literally tens of thousands of

7

individual homeowners are forced to build on top of land

8

that they must rent half a century at a gulp, despite

9

the fact that they want to buy that land at what a court

10

would approve as fair market value and are able to do

11

so.

12

simply

refuse to sell,

13

record

unmistakeably shows, keep even more land off the

14

residential market altogether, despite the great

15

demand .

The situation is that a small number of owners

17

Hawaii if it doesn’t happen elsewhere?

18

asked

19

reached the conclusions elaborately articulated in 1S67

20

and reaffirmed in 1575 that there were in Hawaii crucial

21

artificial deterrents to the normal functioning of the

22

market, deterrents to the landowners selling the land

23

that these who lived on top of it wanted to buy.

24
25

The legislature

that question and, after extensive hearings,

Those deterrents included trust indentures
inherited from the Hawaiian mcnarchs.

They included as

1

a very

practical and crucial matter federal tax

2

disineentives, because the IPS made very clear to the

3

major landowners that were they to sell in large

4

quantities they would be treated as ordinary dealers in

5

real estate and would be taxed at ordinary income rates

6

on virtually 100 percent of the proceeds.
Now, that alone would not produce this bizarre

7

8

pattern were it not also for the shortage of nearby

9

competitors with land to sell.

That is, whatever the

disincentives cf the large landowners, if there were

adjacent landowners whe for some reason were perfectly

happy

the land and the land beneath as well, then this pattern

14

would not have developed.

to meet consumer preferences for a house on top cf

But here, as the legislature found, there was

15
16

a shortage cf alternative competitors, and indeed,

17

unlike some of the early American colonies, those that

18

did not directly break up major landholdings from the

19

crown but nonetheless found the holdings dissolved

20

through natural forces because people could just cross

21

the border and go to a place where they could buy the

22

land under their homes, that wasn't exactly available

23

because crossing the border plunks you in the middle of

24

the ocean.

25

So that was the situation that the legislature

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

confronted, and it found specifically that this land

2

oligopoly would net just naturally fade away; that

indeed

4

deterrents to sale; that it would keep forcing up land

5

prices and lease rents and the cost of living generally,

6

with grave economic and social consequences for the

7

entire state, unless the oligopoly was somehow broken up

8

by law .

it vculd persist because of these artificial

Now, it was against that background that the

9
10

Hawaii Land Reform Act was passed.

As a brief reading

11

of it will make plain to the Court, it dees net simply

12

substitute a favored for a disfavored group of owners.

13

What it does is create a neutral mechanism for

14

identifying where it is that the land oligopoly was

15

actually causing demonstrable,

palpable market failure.

The concept of this Act is that such market

16
17

failure is identifiable where large development tracts

18

are available only in the form of long-term leasehold of

19

the underlying land, despite the willingness and ability

20

of a sufficiently large number of small lot lessees to

21

buy individual lots at fair prices.

22

have lessees who want to buy at fair prices, but all

23

they can get is long-term leaseholds in part of a large

24

tract,

25

That is, where you

there is a demonstrable market failure.
Now, how would a legislature try to figure out

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

when that had occurred?

2

for applications by lessees to say, we’re able and

3

willing to buy, but we're unable to do it because the

4

sellers will not sell.

Well, presumably it would wait

And that's the way this Act works.

That application is a signal that

predicted it would throughout the islands.
At that point the Act relies on a state

11
12

agency, the Hawaii Housing Authority, to decide whether

13

or not

14

would serve the public purpose of creating a competitive

15

land market, and if the answer to that question is yes

16

-- and I suppose that it ordinarily would be, but one

17

can't tell because this is a facial attack on the law

18

and the law has only begun to be applied.

19

condemning all or part of the tract in question

If the answer to that is yes, the Hawaii

20

Housing Authority takes all or part of the tract -- it

21

decides which part -- by eminent domain.

ME. TRIBE;

Under that scheme, title passes

from the landowner to the Hawaii Housing Authority at

3

But if the tenant has qualified and is able to

5

tenant presumably has priority and --

6

QUESTION:

7

HR. TRIBE:

Presumably?
Well, because the statute is net

8

entirely clear on that subject, and on its face the

9

statute suggests, although its purposes I think would

10

best be served by giving priority to the tenant, the

11

statute really places discretion in the state to decide

12

how best to dispose of the now disaggregated

13

landholdings, and the -QUESTION*

landowner is only one cf a group of 25 or whatever that

number is.

HR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

That's right.
But he may end up not ever getting

title?
HR. TRIBE:

Well, if it should turn out that

21

circum stances changed and that the landowner no longer

22

wants to purchase or nc longer can purchase, because his

23

eligibility must be determined both when the land is

24

designated --

25

QUESTION:

Well, how about the agency just

11

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

doesn't want now to sell tc him?
MR. TRIPE:

2

Then what?

I think that I would argue that

3

the agency doesn't have unfettered discretion simply to

4

hold onto it.

5

agency can't use this power to earn profit on the land.

The law says, for instance, that the

But the point is that the statute makes it

6
7

plain that the agency is empowered to lease the land or

8

to sell it tc the tenant.
QUESTION:

9

MR. TRIBE:

10

And lease it to somebody else?
Eossibly.

Obviously, if the Act

11

works as intended I wouldn't expect that to happen.

But

12

it's important to see that the Act structurally has

13

three features that are very different from what the

14

Appellees would suggest and that make the Hawaii Housing

15

Authority anything but a vapid conduit.
First of all, it is suggested by the Appellees

16
17

that the Housing Authority may take only those lets for

18

which the individual occupant has filed an application.

19

That isn't true.

20

the tract.

21

It may take any or all of the lets in

Second, they suggest that it must sell the lot

22

to the occupant, and, although it probably would end up

23

doing that, that's not a requirement of the Act.

24
25

And third, they suggest that the Hawaii
Housing Authority must pay owners with funds supplied by

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the buyers rather than with public funds.

2

Act makes clear that purchasing these lets with public

3

funds

4

legislature that chose to do that would presumably find

5

a mechanism.

is another option.

QUESTION ;

6

Again, the

New, any reasonable

Do you think the agency could just

7

hang on until they can get a better price than the

8

valuation put on in the condemnation proceeding?
KB. TFIBEc

9

Viere it to do that, I think it

10

might violate the prescription against running the

11

system fer profit.

12

not supposed to be used to generate surplus revenue for

13

the state.

That is, the statute says that it's

And if the agency does, as the Act I think

14
15

implicitly contemplates, end up transferring title to

16

the current occupant, presumably any rational system

17

would tax the occupant with the benefit of then becoming

18

the owner.

19

price would come from the occupant is what one would

20

expect .

21

And so the fact that ordinarily the purchase

In fact,

let me say that I don't stress the

22

mechanical details to suggest that the Act would net

23

ordinarily work much as they suppose, but if it dees it

24

simply means that the legislature was correct in its

25

assessment that once the tight grip of the oliaopoly in

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

this case was broken, then one would see the

2

transactions flow naturally.

3

That is,

then one would see those who lived on

4

the land, who wanted tc buy the land under their feet,

5

could afford tc do so, would simply do so.

6

Hawaii

Hcusing Authority facilitates that process.
QUESTION:

7
8

And then I take it if the occupant

finally acquired title to the land, he could sell it?
MR. TRIBE:

9
10

So that the

That's right, the occupant could

sell it.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. TRIBE:

No limitations whatever?
Exactly.

The occupant could sell

13

it.

But the point is, there would now be a market

14

within which these sales would take place.

15

with any kind of divestiture of an oligopoly, whether

16

it's Bell Telephone or anybody else, one is not

17

interested here in state socialism or the government

continuing to run this land.

19

redevelopment case or an urban redevelopment tract.

20

The point is the public purpose here, the

That is, as

This is not an urban

21

public use, is tc break up oligopoly, a fairly

22

traditional public purpose, and then let the market do

23

what it will.

24
25

QUESTION:

And did you say the operation of

the statute has simply been suspended pending the result

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

of this litigation?

2

MR. TRIBE*

Well, not entirely, Justice

3

Brennan.

4

Appellees have called a holding pattern in all but ere

5

case,

6

want to focus quite closely on that case.

In fact, the statute has been put in what the

and when I get to Pullman and Younger standing I

7

It’s the case of Kamiloiki Valley, and in that

8

case as this Court sits an appeal is being considered by

9

the Supreme Court of Hawaii in a proceeding that we will

10

argue ought to have led the courts below not to leap to

11

judgment, much less leap to invalidation cf this

12

statute, but to abstain under either Pullman or Younger

13

or both.
QUESTION;

14

Professor Tribe,

I may be mistaken,

15

but I thought there was one exception, and that was if

16

the tenant ultimately acquired the property he could not

17

sell within ten years.
MR. TRIBE;

to purchase.

20

Blackm un.

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. TRIBE;

Without civing the HHA an option
I think that's right, Justice

There is that exception?
Yes,

there are certain

23

limitations.

But I think it would be fair to say that

24

on the whole the point of the Act is tc create a market

25

and not to have continuing supervision, and for that

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

reason we don’t emphasize such marginal limitations as

2

there are.

3
4

QUESTION :

Is there anything in the statute

which limits the time that the HHA can hold?
MR. TRIBE;

5

If the HHA has not otherwise put

6

the market -- put the property up for sale and the

7

purchase price is tendered/ I believe within 60 days,

8

title must then pass tc the qualified purchaser.
QUESTION;

9

Mr. Tribe, dees the Act apply tc

10

the undeveloped tracts cf land that these group cf

11

landowners refuse to sell?
MR. TRIBE;

12

13

The only theory, Justice

White
QUESTION;

14
15

No.

If it did, would you have the same

arguments?
MR. TRIBE;

16

Well, I suppose if the argument

17

were that their holding of the undeveloped land off the

18

market is itself a sign of oligopoly and that they must

19

be forced tc put some of that on the market as well in

20

return

for just compensation --

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. TRIBE;

Wouldn't you have to?
-- I think we would be making

23

exactly the same argument, though I suppose that the

24

record in the case would lock different and the findings

25

that the legislature made would be quite different in

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

cha racter
There are other limits I suppose I might

2
3

mention, Justice Brennan, and that is that the HHA may

4

net sell to any purchaser mere than one lot.

5

some combination a purchaser were able to acquire, let's

6

say, two lots and another purchaser three and the two

7

purchasers together might be deemed owners of a single

8

development tract of five lots, then they again would be

9

subject to the Act.
And if for some reason, though,

10

And if by

as I tried to

11

describe, the market would almost surely prevent it, the

12

competitive forces working on consumer desires to own

13

the land, if for seme reason such purchasers began then

14

refusing to sell and leasing the land for 55 years cr

15

longer, as the Appellees in this case do, then the Act,

16

which restructures the market, would again be

17

operative.
That is, this Act does not become functus

18
19

officio the moment the new owner occupies.

20

a permanent restructuring of the land market of Hawaii,

21

designed to create a market where now there is market

22

con tro1.

This Act is

And I think it's important to recognize that
that is hardly a radical step.

to bring a suit, but that’s the way government often

works.

that these who occupy should be the ones who are taxed

In any case, let me briefly turn to the

abstention issues, because It seems to me that if this

Court does have doubts along the lines that you're

suggesting -- is there genuinely a public purpose -- and

16

if the Court for the first time in decades were willing

17

to repudiate legislative findings --

QUESTION;

Mr. Trite, you’re pretty

half-hearted about the abstention doctrine.

if we'll rule for you on the merits you want us to say

abstention was not required, but if we're inclined to

MR. TRIBE;

in Thibodaux, that abstention was required, but the

2

Court could quite efficiently say that in dictum ard

uphold this law on the merits, rather than dragging cut

4

what I think is frankly a wholly unsubstantiated attack

5

against the validity of the law.

6

We are not trying to have it both ways.

From

7

the very beginning, as we explain in our reply brief, we

8

have urged that there should be abstention.

10

earlier that there are so many uncertainties about this

statute and the whole scheme that we cught to wait until

12

we hear from the state court.

MR. TRIPE;

If you think those uncertainties

could invalidate it, then of course you must wait.

15

QUESTION;

for cur insisting on abstention.

MR. TRIPE:

I would like to do just that, I

would like to do just that.
Let me say as to Pullman abstention, if there

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

are any doubts about the public purpose, it is the

2

courts of Hawaii in the now pending case that should

3

answer the question.
But that pending case shows ycu precisely how

4

5

Younger abstention also was mandated.

That is, in that

6

case a trial on just compensation was held in November

7

of

8

all practical purposes, once the Hawaii Housing

9

Authority decided that it would serve a public purpose

'82, a trial on public use was held in

1983.

But for

10

to take the Kamiloiki tract on March 30, 1979, that case

11

was pending and under Younger there should have teen

12

absten tion .
And in fact we have argued, I think without

13
14

any meaningful rebuttal from the Appellees, that as

15

early

16

federal complaint was filed, they had every opportunity

17

to present to the Hawaii Housing Authority all of their

constitutional objections, and they did so in a letter,

go for them.

All of these have taken place,

according to my understanding, Justice White, under

20

rulings from the Internal Revenue Service which have not

taxed

22

the proceeds as ordinary income.
QUESTION:

So that I suppose if your clients

23

were forced to sell a lot of these, many, many lots

24

under this Act — suppose the Act is uphold, so that

25

there'll be hundreds of lots sold under this.

Do you

taxed as capital gain?

You mean taxed as what, income

MR. ASHFORD:

9

No, capital gain.

I think that

10

they will not be taxed as straight income, but they will

11

be taxed as capital gains.
Now, the point has been made that my clients

urged the legislature to arrive at this result.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE, ESQ.,

22

ON BEHALF CF APPELLANTS

23

MR. TRIBE:

24

Speaking for the State of Hawaii and not I

25

Yes, briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.

think for any thugs, this law I think is plainly valid.

53

1

And I think I now finally understand the circle that

2

lies at the heart of the Appellees' argument.

3

circle is thiss

4

you need a public purpose.

It’s okay to take this property,

So Justice White askss

5

The
lut

Why isn't spreading

6

ownership a public purpose.

And then we're told:

7

that's a public purpose, but you need tc act

8

constitutionally.

9

constitutional?

And then we ask:

Ch,

Why isn't this

Oh, because there's no public purpose.

I suppose they try to escape from that circle

10
11

by cne narrow escape route, and that is to argue that

12

the government must somehow always take for itself.

13

Justice P.ehnquist and Justice White ask about the

14

irrigation cases and the road cases, and we're told

15

they're distinguishable, as is the Chief Justice's

16

question about urban redevelopment, because there, you

17

see, the government has a plan.
We have a plan, too; they just don't like cur

18
19

plan.

20

Justice O’Connor perceives and as Justice Stevens'

21

question I think indicates, this is just like other

22

forms of divestiture.

23

Our plan is to break up their market power.

As

But their answer is divestiture is regulation,

24

it's not taking.

I think this Court really is concerned

25

with realities and net just labels.

The reason that

54

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

taking is used rather than regulation is that they had

2

the lobbying power to avoid the regulatory route.

3

And when they point out/ mors or less equating

4

themselves with the government, that the government too

5

has a lot of land, why doesn't it sell it, I think I

6

understand what people in Hawaii mean when they say that

7

these landowners are Hawaii's other government.
When they also say that this statute is

8
9

unprecedented, that no legislature has ever been so

10

bold,

11

which broke up landholdings in a way parallel to this,

12

of the Connecticut legislature in

13

Pennsylvania in 1799.

14

action .

15

I am reminded of the Virginia legislature in 1779

1793, and of

This is not unprecedented

And even if you take the pigeonholing approach

16

of insisting that it be compared explicitly with other

17

contemporary exercises of the taking power, it doesn't

18

look all that unprecedented to me.

19

different from Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon, where

20

property rights were, this Court held, in effect taken

21

from the owner of the mining rights under the land and

22

transferred to the surface owner.

23

What followed from that?

It's not really

That there was no

24

power to do it because it went from A to B?

No, all

25

that followed was that you had to compensate, and there

QUESTION:

Well, that’s all the putative

condemnee asked for in Pennsylvania Coal against Mahon.
ME. TRIBE:

4

I suppose the condemnee, though,

5

might have been happy to have the law wholly

6

invalidated.

7

and the Court made clear, I think, that if there were

8

compensation that’s all that would be required.

9

fact,

The brief I think urged also invalidation,

In

the key line in Justice Holmes' opinion is that

10

the State of Pennsylvania must not take a constitutional

11

shortcut, it must pay.
New, when the State cf Hawaii decided to use

12

13

eminent domain, to avoid the constitutional shortcut of

14

the Maryland type law that required the inclusion of

15

options to purchase, it's remarkable that then the

16

Appellees turn around and say, because we're using

17

eminent domain, with its guarantees cf compensation,

18

that now you should strike the law down.
And it's remarkable that they say that because

19
20

those people who occupy the land will, of all things,

21

end up paying for it,

22

unconstitutional.

23

hold.

that that makes this law

We don’t think this Court should so

24

Thank you.
