ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. PUSHECRTH:

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this case presents a challenge to

10

Oklahoma’s requirement that cable TV operators delete

11

wine advertising from programming they bring into the

12

state of Oklahoma.
The District Court found that it is infeasible

13
14

for cable TV operators to delete the advertising from

15

their programming.

16

overturn that finding.

finding by stating that Oklahoma’s advertising ban would

The Court cf Appeals did not

The crux cf this case is the crushing economic

QUESTION:

What is the technical difficulty?

25

MR. RUSHFCRTH:

The technical difficulty,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Justice Erennan, is that the cable TV operators get no

2

notice regarding the time or content of the advertising

3

signals in their programming.

4

cable TV operators pick up signals as they find them

5

over the air or over satellite, and they receive no

6

notice cf advertising.
QUESTIONi

7

Contrary to broadcasters,

Well, if network television

8

producers can give advance notice, why can't the

9

producers of the cable broadcast do the same?
MR. EUSHFCRTKs

10

There is a very marked

11

difference, your honor, between cable TV operators and

12

broadcasters.

13

Oklahoma receives a great deal of advance notice

14

regarding the advertising that will be on that network

15

feed from New York City or wherever it comes from.

16

only To they receive notice, but throuah the affiliation

17

agreement with the network, they have control ever the

18

signal.

and further, they have —

They can delete advertising as they see fit,

the cable TV operator would be required to

multitude of signals coming -QUESTION:

4

There are a

Is there any technical reason why

5

the cablecasters couldn't furnish that information to

6

you, tc your client?
MR. EUSHFORTH:

7

There is no technical reason

8

why they could not furnish

the information, Your Honor.

9

If the cablecasters were to give notice to cable TV

10

operators, nevertheless, the cable TV operators would be

11

in a position, having a multitude of signals coming in

12

simultaneously, of placing an employee at each of these

13

signals, one for each signal, and without full notice of

14

what is in that signal, it cannot be done automatically.
QUESTION:

15
16
17

could

There is no encoding mechanism that

be employed?
MR. RUSHFCRTH:

Your Honor, the technology is

18

simply net there.

19

dealing here in terms of seconds, not in terms of

20

minutes, and unless they have full notice as to what is

21

in the advertising, when it is going tc come precisely,

22

then they will have to wait a number of seconds before

23

they even know what is in the advertising, and they

24

would have to delete it manually.

25

QUESTION:

This must be done manually.

by the Copyright Act?

Cr can you opt out?

ME. RUSHFCRTH s

3

Well, if the cable TV operator

4

wishes tc carry programs from television stations, then

5

as Congress found,

6

TV operator to do that is tc participate in the

7

compulsory licensing scheme.

8

that many of the TV signals picked up by cable

9

television operators are so-called reluctant television

10

stations.

There is no economic incentive for television

11

stations to cooperate with cable TV operators, and

12

indeed many of them have expressly stated they will not

13

so cooperate.
So that in order, as Congress found, in crder

14
15

for the cable TV operator tc carry this type of pregram,

16

which is, of course, the kind of programming most

17

interesting to its subscribers, the only feasible way

18

for the cable TV operator tc do that is by participating

19

in the compulsory licensing scheme.
Now, Oklahoma permits the sale and consumption

20
21

of wine within the state.

QUESTIONi

2

MR. RUSHFORTH;

Cculd they exclude all advertising?
We don't telieve so.

We

3

believe that no case, no decision of this Court holds

4

that the Twenty-First Amendment includes the power to

5

tan interstate advertising by someone net a liquor

6

licensee of the state of Oklahoma.

7

8
9

QUESTION;

Cculd they exclude all cable

operations?
MR. RUSHFCRTHs

Well, we believe — no, they

10

could not, Your Honor.

11

apply its advertising ban to cable TV operators.

12

that year, abandoning a decade's practice, the Attorney

13

General of Oklahoma held that the advertising ban would

14

apply to cable TV operators.

15

Oklahoma until 1980 did not
In

The District Court found that by applying the

16

advertising ban to cable TV, the state would not

17

directly advance its interest in promoting temperance.

18

To the contrary, the District Court found that in light

19

of the pervasive advertising in newspapers, magazines,

20

and other media, and beer advertising that is pervasive

21

throughout the state --

22

QUESTION.-

And allowed on TV.

23

MR. RUSHFCRTF:

And allowed on TV.

That all

24

this incremental advertising on cable would do is inform

25

Oklahomans of what they already knew from other

7

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

sources.

2

findings, but in the face of them, deferred to the

3

legislative judgment of Oklahoma, and upheld the

4

advertising ban as it applies to cable TV.

5

The Court of Appeals did not overturn these

It did so because it misinterpreted this

6

Court’s decisions under the Twenty-First Amendment.

7

Oklahoma rests its entire case on the proposition that

8

the Twenty-First Amendment empowers it not only to

9

regulate or ban the importation, transportation of wine

10

into the state of Oklahoma, but also to ban interstate

11

advertising by someone who is net a liquor licensee, but

12

who is engaged in the business of comm unication.

13

decision of this Ccurt has so held.

14

this Court’s decisions have limited the scope of the

15

Twenty-First Amendment.

16

Nc

Tc the contrary,

In the case of California Liquor Retail

17

Dealers Association versus Midcal Aluminum, this Ccurt

18

held that even in the area of liquor commerce, the

19

federal government retains a substantial interest, and

20

in that case, the Ccurt struck down a California retail

21

pricing scheme.

22

interest in that scheme was unsubstantiated and far

23

outweighed by the federal government’s interest in

24

maintaining competition.

25

The Ccurt said that the state's

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

that where the Twenty-First Amendment is a factor, that

2

seme kind of balancing has to be employed in determining

3

whether there is preemption?
MR. RUSHFORTRi

4

I think, Your Honor, it does

5

when we are talking about the area of liquor commerce.

6

When we go beyond that area, as we certainly do here,

7

because the impact of the state's regulation is upon

8

people not engaged in liquor commerce, but people

9

engaged in an entirely different element of commerce,

10

then this Court's decisions in Craig versus Boren and in

11

Larkin versus Grendel’s Den, for example, say that the

12

Twenty-First Amendment does not alter constitutional

13

analysis.

14

Here, there is a pervasive, a comprehensive

15

federal scheme of regulation of cable television.

16

purpose is to ensure that cable television becomes an

17

integral part of a national communications network.

18
19
20

QUESTION!

Its

Was this argument ever made in the

District Court?
MR. RUSHFORTH:

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

The

21

argument regarding preemption cf Oklahoma's statute by

22

federal law was in the complaint, and the trial judge

23

made a finding in his findings upholding his issuance of

24

a preliminary injunction that cable TV operators could

25

not comply both with state and federal law.

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

The reason the trial court judge decided the

2

surcirary judgment motion on First Amendment grounds as

3

opposed to preemption grounds,

4

asked the parties to brief and argue these elements in

5

the case that were common tc both the broadcasters and

6

the cable TV operators, and that meant he wanted

7

briefing of the First Amendment issue, because by that

8

time the broadcasters were with us.

9

QUESTION :

I believe,

was because he

And is it the broadcasters or the

10

cable TV people that are not -- cannot take advantage of

11

the federal preemption argument?

12

ME. RUSHFCRTF;

The broadcasters, Your Honor,

13

may have a federal preemption argument, but it would be

14

an entirely different argument.

15

that we present here.

16

QUESTION;

It is not the arguent

Then, on appeal tc the Tenth

17

Circuit, did the cable people whom you represent urge

18

the federal preemption ground as an independent or an

19

alternative ground for upholding the judgment of the

20

District Court?

21

MR. EUSHFCRTH;

Your Honor, we urged upon the

22

Court of Appeals in defense of the District Court's

23

ruling primarily First Amendment grounds.

24

for rehearing, we did urge the Court to consider all the

25

issues before the trial court, and then, of course,

In a motion

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

as

1

Your Honor knows, this Court requested us to brief and

2

argue the issues of preemption.
QUESTION;

3

It is a little hard to understand

4

how the Court would be able to resolve the

5

non-commercial speech First Amendment argument or issue

6

as well as the preemption issue without some kind cf a

7

factual record.

MR. RUSHFORTH:

8
9

I just wonder how that could be dene.
Your Honor, if I may point to

the record before the District Court, the District Court

10

explicitly asked the parties whether they wished any

11

further factual evidence placed into the record, and

12

both parties, the state of Cklahoma and my clients,

13

suggested that they did not wish more evidence, and cn

14

that record the District Court made certain findings,

15

including which are findings that cable TV operators

16

here cannot comply with both state and federal law.
Included in those findings is a finding that

17
18

the advertising ban goes beyond the place where it reeds

19

to go

QUESTION;

evidence taken on these subjects in the District Court?
NR. RUSHFORTH;

There is evidence, Your Honor,

the District Court, testimony in the record -QUESTION;

When you say testimony, is this

testimony in open court?

testimony on the technical infeasibility and the

6

economic infeasibility of this rule as it applies to

cable TV operators.

Yes, Your Honor, it is, and it
It includes

And it was on the basis of this

testimony that the Eistrict Court made its finding?

10

MR. PUSHFCRTH*

That’s correct.

11

This pervasive federal scheme is for the

12

purpose of encouraging the development of cable

13

television.

14

direct conflict between state and federal law.

15

the deletion of advertising that Oklahoma seeks would

16

constitute copyright infringement under the Copyright

17

Act, would subject the cable TV operator to criminal and

18

civil penalties, and would force him to lose the

19

compulsory license.

Here, there is no dispute that there is a
Indeed,

It would also directly conflict with rules of

20
21

the Federal Communications Commission requiring that

22

television signals carried by cable TV operators net

23

delete advertising.

24

Court’s decisions compel that the state law must give

25

way.

In these circumstances, this

12

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

The Oklahoma advertising ban also must fall

1

2

under the principles of the First Amendment.

It fellows

3

directly from the District Court finding that the

4

advertising ban here will operate to restrain

5

programming classically protected by the First

6

Amendment,

7

a broad array of cultural, artistic, and infcrmaticnal

8

content that is classically protected by the First

9

Amendment, and the state has net come close to

news, entertainment, sports programming, with

10

sustaining the burden that it must sustain in order to

11

restrict and restrain such programs.

12

QUESTION;

What if seme cable TV operator

13

chose to run some commercials about murder for hire in

14

Oklahoma, and the state cf Cklahoma says, nc, it is

15

against our laws to have that kind of commercial on, so

16

we are net going to be able to show it in Cklahoma, and

17

you say, well, look at all the good stuff people are

18

missing because we just can't delete those commercials

19

from the channel we have taken them from.

20

make the same argument in that kind of a case?

21

MR. RUSHFCRTF:

Would you

Well, Your Honor, certainly if

22

that were the situation, it would not pass the tests

23

that this Court has established for the protection cf

24

commercial speech.

25

set out by this Court in the Central Hudson case,

It would violate the first princple

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

because it would be about activity that is illegal, and

2

sc in that sense it would net be entitled to protection.

3

QUESTION:

Are you saying, then, that

4

Oklahoma's ban on advertising cf liquor simply can’t

5

pass the test for commercial speech, quite apart from

6

its appearance on cable television?

7

says,

9

you can't put up billboards advertising liquor?
NR. RUSHFOFTH:

8

What if Oklahoma

Well, if the advertising were

intrastate. Your Honor, no decision of this Court has

10

included within the power of the Twenty-First amendment

11

to tan that kind of advertising, but it would be a very

12

different case from the one we are involved with here.

13

Here, we are dealing, as this Court stated in

14

Metromedia, with the law of cable television, and there

15

are very special considerations that apply because cf

16

the effect this ban has not only on the commercial

17

speech but on the non-commercial programming carried by

18

cable TV operators.

19

QUESTION:

Well, and does the state always

20

just have tc take the whole thing just as the cable

21

operators put it together because theicable operators

22

argue that they can't screen out the commercials?
ME. RUSH FCFTF :

23

Well, Your Honor, I don't

24

think,

in the situation where the advertising ban were

25

addressed tc something that were illegal under Oklahoma

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

law, then that advertising would not he entitled tc

2

protection under the Central Hudson test.

3

also situations that would, of course, be illegal under

4

federal law, and under those circumstances there could

5

be a federal ban upon the advertising that may be able

6

to pass the Central Hudson test and may not in fact

7

restrain ncn-ccmmercial speech.
This is a situation, however, in which net

8
9

There are

only dees the advertising ban restrain non-commercial

10

speech

because of the economics and technology of cable

11

television, but it also is an advertising ban that does

12

not pass the tests established by this Court in Central

13

Hudson.

14

the state’s interest, as the trial court found, and this

15

Court has never held --

It goes too far.

QUESTION;

16

It is not directly related tc

Why do you say it is not directly

17

related to the state’s interest?

18

wants to discourage consumption of hard liquor, and the

19

theory on which advertisers spend money is presumably

20

that the money they spend is going to increase their

21

sales.

22

Oklahoma for that approach.

23

The state presumably

I don’t see hew you can fault the state of

NR. RUSHFORTH:

Your Honor, I would like tc

24

say two things about that.

First, cable TV operators

25

derive no revenue whatever from wine advertising.

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

They

1

have nc direct relationship with wine advertising.

2
3

QUESTION;

No, but you say they are carrying

it just because they can't sever out the --

4

MR. RUSHFCRTH:

That's correct.

Secondly,

5

Your Honor, and more importantly, the District Court’s

6

finding states very clearly that the incremental

7

advertising on cable TV in the face of advertising on

8

other media, in newspapers, in magazines, cannot do

9

anything but inform Oklahomans of what they already know

10

and will not advance the state's interest.
QUESTION;

11
12

finding on?

What evidence did he make that

Is that just his hunchback?

MR. RUSHFORTH;

13

Or, his hunch?

He made that finding on the

14

evidence that Oklahoma does not ban advertising for wine

15

from the New York Times as it comes into the state of

16

Oklahoma.

17

someone be sitting at the border of the state of

18

Oklahoma clipping wine advertising from the New York

19

No one is suggesting here, Your Honor, that

2

well a Step A.

The state doesn't have to do that.

ME. RUSHFCRTK:

Well, the trial court found,

3

Your Honor, after an examination of the record,

4

including the fact that beer advertising is pervasive

5

throughout the state, that as a matter of fact the

6

application cf this rule tc cable television would net

7

directly advance the state's interest, and it is --

8
9
10

QUESTIONS

What did the trial court conceive

the state's interest tc be?
MR. RUSHEORTH;

The trial court conceived the

11

state's interest to be the promotion of temperance, the

12

prevention of drunk driving —

13

QUESTIONS

Why isn't the state's interest

14

exactly what the Oklahoma legislature said it was, cr

15

the Oklahoma people when they ratified the constitution,

16

that we are interested in net having liquor advertised

17

on television?

18

MR. RUSHFORTH:

Your Honor, this Court's line

19

of cases ending last term with Eclger sets cut clearly

20

who has the burden to sustain a showing, and the state

21

simply has not complied with these requirements here.

22

Thank you.

23

QUESTION:

Counsel, before you sit down —

24

maybe you answered

this when I was out of the room --

25

what brought the Attorney General in 1980 tc issue his

advisory opinion?

Why then?

MR. RUSHFORTH:

2

Why not before?

Your Honor, we frankly don’t

3

know the answer to that question.

requirement that when a state senator, as I understand

5

it, when a state senator makes a request to the Attorney

6

ORAL ARGUMENT CF MICHAEL W. KC CCNNEL1, ESQ.,

16

CN BEHALF OF THE FCC AS AMICUS CURIAE, PRO HAC VICE
MR. MC CONNELL;

17

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

18

please

the Court, the Federal Communcations Commission

19

has regulated the cable television industry since the

20

mid-1960's.

21

have been to encourage the widest availability and

22

diversity of programming to persons all across the

23

nation while ensuring that the position of broadcasters,

24

who are, after all, the originators of most programming,

25

are not undercut by the availability of the new medium.

The consistent themes of that regulation

440 FIRST ST. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

The Commission’s regulatory approach in this

2

area has been dictated in large part by factors inherent

3

to the cable industry, the economic role of cable

4

operators in relation to broadcasters, and the

5

techno logical structure of the cable systems, a matter

6

which Mr. Rushfcrth discussed in his argument.

7

Oklahoma's law at issue here is preempted by

8

federal regulation because it requires cable operators

9

to do

something that the Commission has determined as an

10

economic matter they should not be permitted to do, and

11

that as a technological matter they cannot feasibly do,

12

namely, to delete certain advertisements from the

13

programming to which those advertisements were attached

14

by the program originators.

15
16

QUESTION;

What about cigarette advertising?

That is banned on television by the Commission, is it?

MR. MC CONNELL:

QUESTION:

19
20

Well,

MR. MC CONNELL;

Eecause those advertisements

21

do not appear on any broadcast stations, cable operators

22

have no problem deleting them, because they are not

23

there in the first instance.

MR. MC CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, so long as

the broadcasters and cablecasters then move to

would be preempted for precisely the same reasons that

QUESTION:

I believe that that

let me discuss —

Mr. McConnell, what are the reasons

for the non-deletion requirements of the FCC rules?
MR. MC CONNELL:

The reasons are two.

One has

14

to do with the economics of the cable industry.

15

other has to do with the technological structure.

16

economics drive from the fact that cable operators

17

receive their revenues from subscriber fees, from the

18

hemes that bring in the cable networks to their

19

television sets.

20

22

persons who own the television sets, but who receive

23

their revenues from the advertisers.

25

This is in marked contrast

In addition, the cable operators have no
contractual relationship with the broadcast stations

That is tc

2

say, they have no contract with the station, they pay

3

nomcney tc the stations, and they have no control ever

4

the content of the programming that the stations

5

broadcast.
Cable operators and broadcasters are able to

6
7

proceed in this fashion because there is a certain

8

conjunction of interests that the cable operators obtain

9

free programming, which makes their services more

10

valuable to the subscribers, but at the same time

11

nationwide broadcasters and cable networks expand their

12

audience, thus enabling them to command a higher price

13

for their advertising,

15

to carry the advertising along with the programming.

QUESTION:

Well, Nr. McConnell, the FCC

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

doesn’t protect broadcasters in the Oklahoma situation,

2

does it?

3

concerned net to carry liquor advertising in Oklahoma?

4

They can be required so far as the FCC is

MR. KC CONNELL:

That is correct, Your Honor.

5

The reasons for that are that the local broadcaster is

6

the very person who would receive the revenues from the

7

advertising. There is no third party whose copyright

8

interests would be infringed by the broadcaster not

9

being permitted to carry the advertising.

Moreover, the

10

broadcaster as a technological matter simply broadcasts

11

one signal over which he has complete control, whereas

12

the cable operators are broadcasting a number of

13

signals, usually somewhere between 12 and 30 signals

14

simultaneously, and their operations are simply not

15

equipped even to know what the content of the

16

advertising is, much less to be able to delete it if

17

they did knew.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. McConnell, in making the

19

preemption analysis, do you think that the Court has to

20

do the Midcal type of balancing because of the

21

Twenty-First Amendment?

22

MR. MC CONNELL:

No, Justice O’Connor.

I

23

don’t believe that the Court needs to engage in

24

balancing, because the Twenty-First Amendment gives

25

states enhanced authority over the sale and importation

The most important quid pro quo for being able

to pick up this broadcasting, however, is that they

carry the commercials along with the programming.

not true, and even if this Court were to apply a

20

First, let's talk about the regulatory scheme

Oklahoma's prohibition of liquor advertisement

21

is part cf a state constitutional amendment which

22

repealed Prohibition in 195S.

23

that repealing was that they retain the prohibition

against liquor advertising, and that is to prevent the

2

artificial stimulation of the consumption of alcohol, or

3

increasing the consumption of alcohol, or to consume

4

alcohol if you do not consume it.
I think we must keep in mind here that this is

5
6

the electronic medium.

In the FCC case and some of the

7

other cases, this Court has recognized that the

8

electronic medium is treated specially because of the

9

10

commercial speech, into the home, and the impression

11

that it has upon people who can’t read, or we are

What is the relationship of this state

First of all, I think that it

15

must be pointed cut to the Court that -- I don't think

16

there's any argument about it -- that the rule was

17

pursued -- was pursuant to the Twenty-First Amendment.

18

I don't know if counsel makes light of the Twenty-First

And I would think you would want to

MR. MC DONALD;

One of the other things that

we think that should be addressed by this Court is that

10

what type of setting is there when a Twenty-First

11

Amendment case is presented to the Ccurt,

12

with a presumption in favor of the state in a competing

One of the problems that was presented, cf

25

This Ccurt held that as a matter

And we think that in this particular situation

there is a rational basis.

2

What are some of the dangers of petitioners*

3

arguments?

4

raised by one cf the questions when petitioners were

5

presenting their argument, and that is, what about an

6

unlawful activity being advertised by the cablecaster?

7

That would not have commercial speech protection,

8

because it would be concerning unlawful activity, and it

would net meet the Central Hudson test.

21

of the reasons that there were many complaints that came

in that resulted in the request of an AG's opinion to

and it had not been coming into the homes before, and

2

people were getting rather excited about the uninvited

3

soliciation to — for the artificial stimulation tc

consume alcohol.
In conclusion, the petitioners* challenges to

5

6

Oklahoma’s restriction on liquor advertising is not

7

supported by sound constitutional arguments, nor is

8

petitioners* position supported by sound public policy.

9

If this Court were to adopt petitioners* position, it

10

would leave states powerless tc protect a citizen

11

against liquor advertising, no matter hew fraudulent, nc

12

matter how deceptive.
Under the petitioners* arguments, the federal

13
14

government, despite the Twenty-First Amendment, has

15

absolute power to dictate that the children of Oklahoma

16

be subjected to television advertising of alcohol that

17

is aimed specifically at encouraging the consumption and

18

indeed

19

increased consumption of alcohol.
In proposing the Twenty-First Amendment tc the

20

people of this country, Congress itself refused tc

21

include previsions which would have vested Congress with
