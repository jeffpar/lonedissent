Well, the order that you agreed to

present my argument and address it to now, Mr. Justice

QUESTION*

Well, I have to say for myself it

strikes me that the whole thing is moot, or at least

1

certainly premature.

2

MR. RHYNE*

Well, I would say that that order

3

is illegal, null and void because the court that issued

4

it had no jurisdiction to issue is.
Now, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

5
6

Court,

in this case the appellee’s claim is based upon a

7

complaint that they have been denied access to the —

8

full and complete access to the at large election system

9

provided by the Florida constitution, and

to the

10

political process leading to the nominations and

11

elections in the county commission of Escambia County.
I should have said that Escambia County is

12
13

adjacent to Pensacola.

It had 205,000 people in it in

14

1970,

233,000 in 1980;

15

1970,

16.2 percent of them were eligible voters.

10

1980,

17.2 were eligible voters.

17

voters, 66.9 of the blacks are registered; 69.7 of the

18

whites are registered.

19

and on

20

that way they are pretty equal.

19.7 of those are black.

23

case that any statute or any part of the constitution

24

has been invalidated, and sc I address myself to

The state constitution requires at

In connection with that constitutional

7

11

or not the requirements of Article 3, Clause 2, or

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Rhyne, supposing that the

2

state cf Florida had a cne-year duration of residence

3

requirement in order to vote, which this Court has held

4^ is unconstitutional, and someone went to Escambia County
6

and registered to vote without having qualified for the

one year and was told he couldn’t register.

I think you would have to join the

The precinct men were named — and

6

the other one was named Alright, and they ended up by

paying awards -- I mean fined $5 apiece.

8

MR. RHYNE*

9

QUESTION;

Kell -But there was a state law which was

10

declared unconstitutional in that case, and the

11

government not only was not a party, but when it came up

12

here, the Attorney General didn't even want to defend

13

it.

14

MR.' RHYNE;

Now, there is a federal statute.

15

Justice Marshall, that requires that any judge before

16

whom the constitutionality cf a state statute or the

17

constitution is drawn in question, 2403(b), must notify

18

the state Attorney General —

didn't want to come, and this Court says come, and he

did come.

Hr. Rhyne, suppose we — say we

study this out very carefully, based on your brief, and
10

I am very interested in listening to the merits of the

11

case.

12

KE. RHYNEs

Well, I think also. Your Honor,

13

this statement that no state statute or constitutional

14

provision has been invalidated by the judgment below,

15

which is the second sentence in their brief, is a

16

statement that is very hard to defend, since the —

QUESTION;

Your central point, though, doesn't

turn on this, does it?
KE. EHYNE*

The Court of Appeals in about the

20

third line of its decision says that the lower court

21

declared this constitution and statute unconstitutional,

22

and then they affirmed it, so that statement is wrong.

23

Now, the appellees throughout their brief have

24

constantly claimed that it is Florida's constitution, it

25

is at large constitution that has caused the damage, and

11
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that under Article 3, Section 2, Clause 1, the federal

2

courts have no jurisdiction.

3

With respect to the merits, I would first of

4

all address myself to something that they make a let of

5

in connection with the so-called referendum.

6

Hr. Justice Brennan, that is what you have in mind.

7

Now, the referendums were net suggested by the blacks or

8

because there was any discrimination against them.

15

That had been voted down.

And

So, they appointed a charter study committee

17
18

of five, one of whom was a black, to draw up a new

19

charter for the county of Escambia, as they have a right

20

to do.

21

and on

22

they were divided three to two.

24

9

And so the commissioners then appointed

10

another study committee of five, and that committee

11

tried to put together the ideas of the two dissenters

12

and the three who were for this charter, and so they

13

worked for three or four months and came up with a new

14

charter, and they recommended five elected in

15

districts.

16

in there is that this could never be used to consolidate

17

Pensacola and Escambia. That seemed to be the major

18

thing that bothered the people there then, and they also

revised throughout the charter.

They put in there — the main thing they put

And when they finished that revision, they

20

21

called in their staff and had them go over it, and

22

finally, by August, they were ready to go public, sc to

23

speak,

24

so they announced that they were going to release a

25

draft of this charter, and publish it — they published

with the results of the work on the charter, and

they would then have eight public hearings.

13

The commissioners can't do anything about

They can't change it at all.
The commissioners here made tremendous changes

14

in this charter, and one of them was to keep the five

15

elected at large.

16

the big thing that was before the people in connection

17

with the referendum which they announced would take

18

place on November 8th.

1

They were shocked at the fact that only 15 or 20 people

20

came out to the various hearings.

21

hearings, three blacks did appear and say they wanted

22

single member districts, that blacks would get a fairer

23

deal if they had single member districts than if they

24

had elections at large.

25

Now, the other side pretends this was

1

all that kind of thing, they finally adopted on the 14th

2

of September a final draft which was published in the

3

newspapers, and was given to anybody who wanted to study

4

it, and that draft was voted on then in November and

5

defeated, and so then we were into 1978, and we ccire to

pretrial statement was just the one that I just read

12

It was all aimed at the state of Florida.
And so, at the hearing before Judge Arne, they

13

asked each one of the commissioners and they each

14

testified as to why they favored at large rather than

15

single member districts, and the general purport of it

16

was the problems are at large, and so therefore the cure

2

they filed a post-trial memorandum in which they said

3

that they wanted to keep the five to protect the

incumb ency.

5

The Court of Appeals, when they get to that,

6

they said they had read the entire testimony.

7

found no evidence whatever of racial motivation on the

8

part of the commissioners, and that protecting one’s

incumbency didn’t mean blacks qua blacks, and so

therefore reversed. They did grant a rehearing.

did grant comments on the Rogers versus Lodge, and net a

They

And in doing so, they decided that the Rogers

versus Ledge was different from White versus Register

17

broader way to uphold — give greater deference to the

15

MR. MENEFEE:

That, as the District Court

16

called it, anomalous situation.

From approximately the

17

turn of the century, after all of the — most of the

18

disenfranchising devices had taken effect, blacks were

19

removed from the electorate, then they went to the

20

situation where the all-white Democratic primary was

21

conducted from single member districts, but the general

22

election, which in my part of the country didn't mean a

23

whole heck cf a lot back then, was conducted at large.

24

They let black folks vote in the general election, but

25

not in the single member district Democratic primary,

I do believe the mootness issue

was addressed in the appellee's brief.

Then we can really get rid of these judgments.

Well, your position, as I

understand it, isn't that it is moot.

It is that you

are the party that at one time — you represent the

11

party that sought to challenge the Court of Appeals for

12

the Eleventh Circuit's judgment.

changed its mind.

QUESTION:

3

The only thing is, you don't happen

to represent the two individual commissioners.

4
5

That is correct, Your Honor

MR. SANTURI.:

I represent the board of county

commissioners.

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

Veil, they have two

7

individual commissioners who are parties in their cwn

8

right.
MR. SANTURI:

9

But we are saying that they do

10

not have the requisite interest in this particular case

11

to force the county to keep pursuing the appeal.
QUESTION:

12

Well, to pass on the issue that you

13

have raised, the Court would have to decide whether

14

these two have any .interest to preserve.
MR. SANTURI:

15
16

I believe that's correct, Mr.

Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

17

Of course, it would be a nice thing

18

— if

19

this to the Court of Appeals for two or three reasons,

20

one, to consider your point first: secondly, if there is

21

still a live case, to consider — reconsider the matter

22

23

MR. SANTURI:

Remand may be the correct

24

vehicle in order to — There are some factual assertions

QUESTION:

It would have to remand it

That is correct, Justice White.

May I ask, in your opinion, whom

does Mr. Rhyne represent?
MR. SANTURI:

Justice Stevens, I believe that

he has named Commissioner Dickson, Commissioner Kelsey,

10

and he represents also certain former members cf the

11

board of county commissioners.

QUESTION: ’ He has certainly made it clear he
