ORAL ARGUMENT CF CRAIG S. BARNARD, ESQ.

ON EEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BARNARD*

please the Court.
Mr. Spaziano is before the Court for review of

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

a death sentence imposed by the State of Florida.

The

10

questions presented here involve whether the procedures

11

that were followed were adequate to assure reliability

12

of either the guilt determination or the penalty

13

determination.
Despite the evidence and the verdict,

Mr. Spaziano may or may not be guilty of first degree

17

options in its guilt deliberations.

18

the jury did have, the sentencing verdict it did choose

19

to exercise, and that was overriden by a judge that was

20

not — the judge that was net privy to the guilt

deliberations of the jury.

MR. BARNARD:

QUESTION:

9

MR. BARNARD:

That's correct.

And the jury -- I see your point.
Well, there are dual constraints

10

on the power of the jury's decisionmaking here.

11

were constraints in the guilt phase on the jury's

12

ability to evaluate the defendant’s culp.ability in any

13

reasonable manner.

There

The question here is whether, in the guilt

14
15

phase,

the jury must be given more than two options; or,

16

if not, must the jury -- the jury's verdict for life in

17

the second phase at least be accorded finality.

18

QUESTIONi

If you prevail in this case,

19

counsel, what's the consequence of your prevailing?

of Eec k would indicate that a new trial is required,

because the harm in Feck was the harm of a distorted

The question as to whether a new

Mr. Barnard, you're arguing two

quite separate points, though, aren't you?

That

wouldn't be true of both of your points, would it?

11

You have a lesser included offense argument,

12

as I understand it, and also you argue that the jury

13

should

net have been overridden on the penalty phase.

14

MR. BARNARD:

15

QUESTION:

16

to get

That's correct.

As to the latter, you wouldn't want

a new trial, would you?

17

MR. BARNARD:

No.

18

But the first issue is the Beck issue.

It

19

involves an application of the Court’s decision in Beck

20

v. Alabama.

21

sentence, very simply, may not be imposed, consistent

22

with the Constitution, where it is imposed after a

23

verdict of guilt of a capital offense, where the jury

24

had no other options other than acquittal.

25

The Court held in Beck that the death

The Court reasoned that such a situation puts

5

1

pressure on the jury, if you will, that threatens the

2

efficacy of the reasonable doubt standard in that guilt

3

determination, so much so that in a capital case, that

4

risk can't be tolerated; that the risk of an unwarranted

5

conviction is just too great.

6

Therefore, in Beck, where the Alabama

7

legislature had passed a statute preventing the jury

8

from considering lesser offenses, that procedure was

9

held to be unconstitutional.

10

Similarly, in Keeble, where the Court was

11

faced with the prosecution cf an Indian, and there was

12

no jurisdiction in the lower court over lesser offenses

13

for an Indian, the Court determined t»hat nevertheless

14

there was error.

15

So it is the unavailability of the —

16

QUESTION;

17

do you know?

18
19
20

And what was the result in Keeble,

MB. BARNARD;
result?

I do net know.

The final

It was remanded.
QUESTION;

I suppose the inference is that the

21

Federal Court, despite the lack of jurisdiction, could

22

find him guilty, try him and find him guilty of the

23

lesser included facts.

24

there is nothing -- or did he?

25

NR. BARNARD;

He didn’t go free.

I do net know that.

6

At least

It may have

1

been — I do knew that the Court here has since held

2

that it did not decide the question of jurisdiction in

3

K e e tl e .

4

QUESTIGN:

I take it here, there was no

5

request for lesser included offense instructions, in

6

your case?
MR. BARNARDi

7

Well, they never got to the

8

point of the request, because the statute of limitations

9

had run.

10
11

12

The only way that there could have been

instructions is if there were no statute of limitations.
QUESTION*

But you're now saying that there

should have been such an instruction, I take it.

13

MR. BARNARDi

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

And would you have had the judge

15

charga the jury on the elements of the offense, and also

16

tell the jury that the statute of limitations had run,

17

and that no judgment could be entered on the verdict if

18

they returned a verdict of that kind?

19
20
21

MR. BARNARD:

No, I don't believe it would,

because the situation would be the same result as Beck.
QUESTION:

Then you'd have the judge charge

22

the jury, and give the jury the impression that the

23

defendant could be sentenced if they returned a verdict

24

on the lesser included offense, even though, in fact,

25

the defendant couldn't be sentenced.

7

1

HP. BARNARD;

Well

the jury would be doing

2

precisely what the jury is doing, what it is supposed to

3

do — excuse me.

4

fact that a jury is the fact finder that returns a

5

verdict and tells us essentially what offense has

occurred.

7

Florida, is a separate legal decision that the judge can

8

make.

10

See, cur position is premised on the

And the statute of limitations, especially in

It is made, most of the time, by a judge, net by

QUESTION;

Well, tut if the theory of a lesser

11

included offense charge is that the jury may be willing,

12

in a doubtful case, may be willing to find someone

13

guilty of a lesser included offense rather than a

14

greater offense, if they think they have that option,

15

rther than just the option between acquitting and

16

finding guilty of the greater offense, isn't it a little

17

inconsistent to give the jury the impression that they

18

can return a verdict of guilty on this lesser offense,

19

and that there will be punishment for it when, in fact,

20

there can’t be any?

21

MR. BARNARD;

Ky answer is that I believe that

22

it would not mislead the jury to instruct on the lesser

23

offenses, because if the jury were instructed on the

24

offense -- the lesser offenses — determined, as juries

25

do, what offense has been committed, and if it was the

should he doing.

statute of limitations.

4

The judge would then determine the

But there are other options.

If it is

5

believed that that would mislead the jury too much, the

6

State has other options, one of which is to change its

7

statute of limitations, which, incidentally, Florida has

8

since done.

10

There are a number of options to get around

unavailability to that jury of the lesser offense.

MR. BARNARD;

it, to the lesser included offense instructions.

That is absolutely clear

Yes.

QUESTION;

Was he asked to waive the statute

of limitations?
MR. BARNARD;

Yes.

And he did not want to

waive the statute of limitations, and did not.
QUESTION;

Is there any role in Florida.for

24

the jury to make determinations in connection with the

don’t want to suggest to the Court that they are.

QUESTION*

Those, I think, indicate --

Does the record tell us what the

vote of the jury was on the life sentence?
MR. BARNARD*

I cannot tell you the vote.

It's net a matter of our record, that I know of.
QUESTION*

Well, under Florida law, would it

22

be lawful, would it be possible to know, unless the jury

23

foreman reported it affirmatively to the judge?

MR. EARNARD*

25

QUESTION*

It is --

Ordinarily, a judge instructs the

12

1

jury foreman not to disclose the exact vote.

2

SR. BARNARD*

That’s correct.

In this case,

3

however, the judge was going to poll the jury, and then

they all decided not to, I guess, not to embarrass the

was a majority.

18

So our position, very simply, is that the evil

of unreliability predicted by Reck came true here.

The

20

■ jury was deprived of the opportunity of fully evaluating

21

the weight of the evidence in any reasonable manner, for

22

precisely the reasons the Court said in Beck, the

23

pressures that this Court identified in Beck.

24
25

QUESTION*

Mr. Barnard, are you making any

claim that the State purposefully delayed this case

13

until

MR. BARNARD;

We are making a claim, not as to

intent so much, as to the pcssbility of intent.

6

could prove that?

7

do it?

Would your case be different if you
Or does the State have the right to

MR. BARNARD;

8

I --

I just don't know.

If the State

9

intentionally waited until after the statute of

10

limitations, I think that the argument would be

11

stronger, but nevertheless, I think under the facts of

12

this case, which is -QUESTION;

13

Why would it be any stronger?

14

you have to do is waive the statute.

15

protect yourself from that.
ME. BARNARD;

All

I mean you could

Could, but that’s a penalty.

That's a very harsh penalty for --

18

QUESTION;

It just cancels out the delay is

19

all it does.

I don’t see any harsh penalty about that.

20

If they’re deliberately delaying so that you’ll have a

21

defense you wouldn't otherwise have, then you waive the

22

defense, it seems to me you're back where you started

23

from.

24

MR. BARNARD;

I think I understand that.

25

In this case, I think it’s important to knew,

14

1

howeve r, that there was only a three-week delay, and

2

that t he State of Florida had, according to its records,

3

our re cord, had known for a year about Dilisio's

4

allega tions here -- the complaining witness — had known

5

for a year about them, and so we're left, I guess, with

6

an unr esolved record, but one that certainly could be

int erp reted as indicating intent.

QUESTIONS

When the state legislature, as

17

appare ntly the Florida State Legislature has done, gives

18

the ju dge that power, are they not saying in so many

19

words that the jury is permitted to make a

20

reccmm endation to the judge for whatever use the judge

21

wants to make of that recommendation.

Well, what if the legislature had,

in so many words, expressly said the jury, at its

option, may recommend to the judge the sentence to be

given, but the judge shall have sole and final power?

11

Would you have any problem with that kind of a statute?

Under the arguments that we're

13

presenting, yes, I would have a problem with that

MR. BARNARD;

Yes , but I think we need tc

Your theory would outlaw judge

MR. BARNARD;

20

In all crimes?

I don't believe

21

so.

Our focus is on the unique nature of the capital

sentencing decision; that capital sentencing brings

23

considerations that are not controlling in non-capital

cases.

Is your argument, Nr. Earnard, that

a mere reliable sentencer, or that you have to have

5

perhaps both a judge and jury agree?

6

which it is.

I am not sure

7

Ec you understand my question?

8

MR. BARNARD:

9

Yes.

It is very simply that a

judge may not impose a death sentence after a jury has

10

ruled in favor of the defendant on that sentence, if the

11

jury imposes life.
QUESTION:

22

argument from what you said orally.
MR. BARNARD;

23

You don't

I don't really understand your

I am enthusiastic about our

24

argument.

Cur argument, very simply, follows the

25

methodology of the Court, which is the Eighth Amendment

21

1

testing the contemporary values.

2

the mid-19th century, the constant move towards jury

3

senten cing .

4

And you can see, since

And then, looking now at what's going on, it

5

is still jury sentencing, and the states did not move

6

away from jury sentencing, including Florida, that had

7

jury sentencing for 100 years, until the Court’s

8

decision in Furman, suggesting, as it was suggested in

9

Woodson v. North Carolina, that the states were not

10

reacting in any judgment about whether a judge or a jury

11

was a better sentencer, but simply trying to retain the

12

constitutionality of the statute after Furman.

13

So our decision or our argument is, first,

14

that the Eighth Amendment, tested by the evolving

15

standards, requires it and that the Court’s independent

16

assessment also should counsel that way, because the

17

The Court has repeatedly emphasized

and

Well, it isn’t just retribution.

23

It’s also deterrence with respect to the rest of the

community.

ME. BARNARD;

Deterrence is relevant for a

22

1

legislature when it is deciding whether to pass a

2

statute or not.

3

the sentencing phase, selecting who is going to die,

4

because that type of an issue is directed towards other

5

people, not towards the uniqueness of the particular

6

individual themselves.

It’s not, I don’t believe, relevant at

QUESTION;

7

Well,

I suppose the irony of your

8

position, if you really mean it, is that a judge would

9

never have a role in whether or not to impose a death

10

penalty, and if the jury imposed the death penalty, he

11

could not override that decision.
HE. BARNARD:

12

No, I don't think that's the

13

result, any more than it would be the result in an

14

acquit tal.
QUESTION;

15

Well, you say that the jury is the

16

sole sentencer under the Eighth Amendment.

business has a judge got overruling them?
MR. BARNARD;

Well, the analogy is to trial

I don't think I could argue

I don't think it is either constitutionally

Nell, nc, we don’t; because,

the jury doesn’t sentence the man

The question was asked, when counsel was

11

arguing about whether the Florida statute has a jury

12

sentencing or a mere advisory sentence, counsel has

13

indicated that he thought it was a sentence.

14

here.

22

QUESTION;

This is a

It’s in compliance

Well, your opposition says that a

23

jury do the sentencing in this case, and if Florida

24

purports to put the decision in the hands of a judge,

25

it’s wrong, it’s not complying with the Constitution.

29

1

What have you got to say about that?

2

HR. MENSER:

Well, Mr. Justice White, we h ave

3

200 men cn death row.

We have 80 cases where the ju dge

4

erred in overriding the jury verdict, and we have 12 0

5

cases where the judge blindly followed the jury and

6

refused to exercise his discretion and superior

7

abilities, okay.
The argument just doesn't have any merit,

8
9

The

fact is that Florida is a very unique state.

10

Mr. Spaziano may be happy going with a jury decision in

16

So it's just a specious argument.

17

QUESTION:

May I inquire?

You say there a re

18

120 cases where the judge followed the jury's

19

recommendation or advisory verdict of death, and 80

20

where they overrode.

21

22

How many are there in which the judge or j ury
recommended death, and the judge overruled and gave life?

23

MR. MENSER:

24

When the judge enters a life sentence, the y do

When there is a life sentence, it would just

go to a District Court of Appeal which would make the

QUESTION:

4

So, in effect, the way it seems to

5

work out is if the jury recommends death, it's going to

6

be death.

7

a second opportunity for the State to impose the death

9

And if the jury recommends life, there may be

MR. MENSER:

No.

In fact, this Court observed

10

in both Proffitt and Barclay, that the Florida Supreme

11

Court has rejected almost 80 percent of the jury

12

overrides where death has been imposed.

13

where the jury has recommended death, we don't know how

14

many times the judge has given life.

15

assume it happens.

16

QUESTION:

And, in cases

But we have to

Those statistics you were citing

17

were just from the people on Death Row who, I suppose,

by definition, end up with a death sentence.

19

MR. MENSER:

20

That's the long and the short of it, unless

21
22

Correct.

the Court has any particular question.
QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you this question

23

about it, because I am somewhat interested in the

24

question whether it's appropriate to impose a death

25

sentence when the jury has apparently unanimously

31

1

recommended life, which is fair to infer, I think, from

2

the promptness with which they acted here.

3
4

What is the rationale for the death penalty,
for Florida’s death penalty?

5

KB. MESSEFi

Is it rehabilitation?

Well, we do know that no one

6

who's received it has ever broken the law again.

7

the fact is that -- not to be facetious -- but the fact

8

is there are three prongs, okay.

9

society has to be protected.

There is the fact that

In Nr. Spaziano's case,

10

perhaps 12 murders, 4 bombings, who knows how many

11

rapes,

12

But

okay.
QUESTION*

But they would not be protected by

13

incarc eration for life , wit hout possibility of parole.

14

for ex ample.

15

HR. MENSER :

No, because the murders go on in

16

prison , and there is a real and present danger to prison

17

g u a rd s and other inmat es.

18

The second one is the deterrence factor.

We

19

do know that — well, we’ll never know how many people

20

don’t commit murder because they might get the chair.

21

We do know, again, that the recidivism rate for executed

22

prisoners is zero, and that — and if one life is saved

23

that way, that’s fine with us.

24
25

It’s worth it.

And the third factor, of course, is so
miniscule as to be nonexistent, but counsel refers tc

QUESTIONS

This i s why some penologists have

2

said that the death sentenc e should be imposed for

3

prisoners, life prisoners w ho commit a murder within the

4

prison or in the process of escape — limiting the death

5

sentence to that narrow cat egory, because there is no

other deterrence on them.

statute, the limitations problem would not exist,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG S. BARNARD, ESQ.

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

19

MR. BARNARD;

Very briefly,

just to clear up

20

some facts.

Justice Stevens’s question regarding

21

overruling a death verdict, judges overruling a death

22

verdict — those statistics are not kept, but there are

23

some indications in our certiorari petition — the

24

petition itself — we had attached an appendix which set

25

out some of those statistics from data done by --

35

1

collected by Linda Foley, Professor Foley, who has done

2

a study.

3

*
That data reports — and again, it's set out

4

in the certiorari petition appendix -- that where death

5

is involved, either the jury or the judge is thinking

6

about death, or has decided on death, the disagreement

7

is about 6 percent the judge would impose life or the

8

jury would impose death; in 28 percent, where the jury

9

would impose and then the judge imposes death.

10

So the disagreement is quite vast there.

11

About avoiding detection, that is, of course,

12

not true.

13

the State file an arrest warrant, and that tolls the

14

statute of limitations, so there is absolutely no

15

indication in this record at all that Joe Spaziano was

16

avoiding detection.
