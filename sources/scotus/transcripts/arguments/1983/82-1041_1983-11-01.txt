Mr. Riggs, ycu may

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts

This is a gift tax case, here on a writ of

decision for the taxpayers ty the United States Tax

exception.

3

Our point or our position and wha t we would

4

like to emphasize here at oral argument can be stated

5

briefly in three pointss
One, the Gift Tax Code cannot be reaso nably

6

7

interpreted to include the Respondent’s rig ht to use

8

theory.

Khis theory that there is a proper ty right to
\

9 use we submit amounts to no more than the a ttempt to tax
10

potential income as a gift.
Second, the decision below, if it is upheld,

11
12

will destroy the reasonable expectations of many

13

taxpayers and will add to an already overbu rdened

14

judici ary.

15

Three, if there is a gap in the present law

16

which should be corrected, Congress should act and net

17

the Executive or the Judicial Branches.

18

QUESTION*

Sr. Riggs, were tax lawyers

19

advising their clients that the position you espouse is

20

correct before the Crown case?

21

MR. RIGGS*

Justice O’Connor, I don’t know how

22

they were advising their clients.

Before Crown, a

23

district court in the Middle District of Texas, if I

24

remember correctly, decided this same issue and decided

26

it in favor of the taxpayer, and the Government did not

7

MR. RIGGS;

No, ma’am.

I really believe that

what’s at stake here has been common among families as

9

long as there have been families.

And a great many cf

these loans are made with absolutely no tax results in

13

That’s the reason I was hesitant to

QUESTION;

Sell, I suppose a great many

14

intra-family loans can be made without tax consequences

15

under the previsions for the annual giving without tax

16

consequences and the cumulative life exemption.

17

MB. RIGGS;

Yes, ma’am.

But an awful lot of

18

taxpayers annually make the amount of the annual

19

exclusion as a gift.

20

that either results in a tax or it reduces a one-time

21

lifetime credit.

No question about it.

There's a

QUESTION*

7

Well, what's the difference in

8

terms of real estate transactions in the law of real

9

estate between a lease which conveys part of the

10

property, the use of the property, and the property

11

itself?
MR, RIGGS*

12

The great difference, Your Honor,

13

is the common law on which the statute is superimposed.

14

A use -- and incidentally, the use doesn't have to he

15

16

Mr. Riggs, do I correctly

MR. RIGGSs

Yes, Your Honor.
How about an I0U?
Well, I don’t understand an IOU,

Justice Marshall, to be any more than, without any other

facts,

to a non-interest bearing demand loan.

Is there any case on it?
I beg your pardon?
Is there any case on it?

QUESTION:

Of course, I believe that a note

And a note that doesn’t have a term

specified is due on demand, isn’t it?
MR. RIGGSs

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, sir.

And

21

our whole point is that if your’re going to find

22

something is not a gift — and a loan is not; it’s the

23

antithesis of a gift — then you’re going to have tc fit

of a gift, isn't it, the transfer of a property interest

MR. RIGGS:

18

The area in which we’re in,

19

Justice Eehnquist, is a transfer for consideration.

QUESTION;

Exactly, Your Honor, exactly.
But the Solicitor General has cited

a number of cases, has he not, dealing with cases

arising out of charitable deductions for contributions

to charities, where the right to use property for a

there are a number of authorities in accord with that

This Court in Commissioner against Wemyss,

Perhaps the most obvious way in which it

the Code, which is cited on pages 2 and 3 of our brief,

KR . WALLACES

8

9

Where in the world are you

Well, there are many difficult

questions under the gift tax law, many of which will

10

remain, however this case is decided.

Many of them

11

revolve around the question of what constitutes support

12

for dependents that traditionally has not been subjected

13

to the gift tax, and these questions arise whether what

14

is involved is a loan or the direct payment of a corpus

15

that constitutes support.
The same question arises with respect to a

16
17

dependent whether you allow that person to have the use

18

of a portion of your residence or whether you supply

19

food and clothing for that individual which is

20

consumed.

21

And ordinarily, the Congress and the courts

22

and the Commissioner have proceeded on the assumption

23

that when there's a legal obligation to provide support

24

the provision of that support is not a gift subject to

25

the gift tax.

What if it goes beyond a legal obligation

22

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

These are difficult questions

There is a great difference between providing

the or dinary items of clothing, even if they may be

9

MR. WALLACE*

That doesn't have to follow, in

our view, because our theory of the gift is not that the

that constitutes the gift.

of business transactions.

There have been different rates specified by

the Commissioner in asserting deficiencies in this area ,

19

partly reflecting differences in prevailing rates of

20

interest at the time, but also partly reflecting the

particular circumstances of the case, because the demand

CHIEF JUSTICE BUFGER*

Hr. Wallace, you have

seven minutes remaining.

5

HR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

We have set forth the contemporaneous Treasury

7

regulations in our brief, and on page 12 and 13

we have

8

discussed in particular the 1936 regulation which refers

9

to the enjoyment of property which is not itself fully

10

transferred, but the right to enjoy it is transferred

11

and subject to the gift tax, which fits the concept cf

12

what we have here even though there was no specific

13

reference to a loan here.

14

The principal is a lean rather than a gift,

15

but the enjoyment in this case is the right to use that

16

money during the time in which the donor doesn’t require

17

the principal to be repaid.

16

QUESTION:

Hr. Wallace, what if, instead of

19

being an interest-free loan in this case, the loan were

20

made at the rate of six percent and the Commissioner

21

felt that the going rate at the time was 14 percent for

22

an unsecured loan.

23

your view the same way he attacks this one?

24
25

Could he attack that transaction in

HR. WALLACE:

He certainly could.

Whether or

not successfully would depend on whether he could preve

36

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

that it came within the statutory criterion of property

2

transferred for less than an adequate and full

3

consideration in money or money’s worth.

4

criterion Congress has specified, as set forth in our

5

brief.
QUESTION*

6

That is the

Mr. Wallace, as I understand it the

7

dimensions of this problem have been changed with the

8

increased exemption to $10,000 and $20,000.
MR. WALLACE*

9

Well, yes, the applicability has

10

been changed, that is correct.

11

value of the gift, but the principal could be much

12

larger .
QUESTION:

13

There’s exclusion of the

But the donee would have to receive

14

a very substantial sum of money before we’d have any

15

application of this.

MR. WALLACE*

QUESTION*

K R. WALLACE*

19

QUESTION*

20

MR. WALLACE*

21

22
23

That is correct.

About how much?
Well —

Hundreds of thousands?
It would be many hundreds cf

thousa nds.
QUESTION*

It would depend on whether he had

already exceeded his allowance.

24

MR. WALLACE*

25

QUESTION*

For the year.

Yes.

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

MR. WALLACE:

1

2

For the year.

If there were

other gifts that year, you know, they too add up.
QUESTION:

3

Under your position, in figuring

4

out whether you've exceeded your allowance you have to

5

include these things?
MR. WALLACE:

6

That is correct.

And they seem

7

to us squarely to come within the statutory definition

8

and the definitions in the committee reports and in the

9

regulations, and they are obviously a means of

10

transferring wealth to one's intended beneficiaries in a

11

way that would exclude the likelihood of additional

12

estate tax liability, in a way that transfers income tax

13

liability on any further income that's generated from

14

the donor, who is likely to be in a higher income tax

15

bracket, to the donee.
So they come squarely within the purpose, as

16
17

well as the broad language, of the gift tax law.
And I would like to be sure that the theory of

18
19

the Government is well understood here, because it has

20

erroneously been argued that we are in some way doubling

21

the taxation of income that's generated.

22

the gift is not the income that is generated by that

23

property.

24
25

The value of

The way we value and tax the gift is precisely
the way ve would with a gift of stock, by its market

value,

here the market value of the right to use the

2

money.

3

that is a separate matter that is taxed under the income

4

tax law.

5

pay income tax on dividends that are generated, and if

6

the stock is given to the donee he pays income tax on

7

any dividends that are generated.

If the stock does in fact generate dividends,

And the same thing is true of any income

9

If the donor had retained the stock he would

generated by the use of the money.

It in no way

10

duplicates the tax on the gift, which is the transfer of

11

the right to use that money.

12

QUESTIONt

If the affluent father should put

13

up $100,000 worth of Government bonds or market value

14

securities to secure the son’s loan at a bank, would

15

there be any gift?
MB. WALLACE:

16

There would, in the use of that

17

money, of that security that would otherwise be

18

available, whatever the market —
QUESTION:

19
20
21

What’s the value of the use of the

security ?
MR. WALLACE:

Whatever it would cost someone

22

to get it if it weren’t given to him, the same as the

23

value of any other gift.

24

QUESTION*

Well, how would you measure it?

25

MR. WALLACE:

By what it would cost you to get

2

willing to give it to you.

3

expert testimony.
QUESTION*

4

It might — it would take

How do you measure the value of a

5

demand note the day it's given, where it's just on

6

demand ?

MR. WALLACE*

7

Well, we have talked about the

8

method of valuing it.

9

periodically and in retrospect.
QUESTION*

10
11

It can only be valued

valued at the tine the gift is given?
MR. WALLACE*

12

And so is this.

Eut this is an

It's not jus t a gift that takes place at

14

the one time when it's first given, because the extent

15

of the gift can only be known by how long the donor

16

forebears in asking for it to be returned.
QUESTION*

17
18

Let me change the hypothetical.

Father guarantees the loan at the bank.
MR. WALLACE*

No, I'm just -- I'm limiting this

MR. WALLACES

There’s no property being

transferred to the donee in that situation.

pointed out in footnote 24 on page 18 of our brief, in

4

that dissent in the Tax Court in the Crown case, Judge

5

Simpson, joined by Judges Romm and Tamm and Wald and

6

Wilbur, did eguate this situation with the situation

7

where the donor arranged for a bank to provide the use

of these funds to the donee and paid the interest.

believe Justice Powell foresaw it when he asked, hew do

4

seems to have some effect on the feeling in this case?

One is, since 1976 we don’t have separate gift
The estate is

10

all the way back to 1932, if you did not file a 709, a

11

gift tax return, there’s no statute cf limitations.

12

this Court allows a brand new concept of gift to come

13

into the taxing picture, there literally is no limit,

14

until you get back of 1932, that this tax can place.

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. RIGGS;

17

QUESTIO»;

Yes, sir, Justice.
The Chief Justice asked Mr. Wallace

18

about the loan of securities as collateral for the

19

donee's loan.

If

What do you think about that?

MR. RIGGS;

Your Honor, I know there’s a case

21

that’s held exactly that it is not a gift, and I was

22

trying with my co-counsel desperately to find it when it

23

came up, but I cannot recall it.

24

a case in the Tax Court ruling it was not a gift.

25

QUESTION;

But I do know there’s

Would you take the position that,

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-S300

1

say, a taxpayer in a high income bracket could turn over

2

a portfolio of securities to someone else and say, I*m

3

just loaning these to you and you just keep the income,

4

and then when I want them back you give them back tc me,

5

thsre'd be no gift?

6

9
10
11

ME. RIGGS*

Well, may I add one more thing?

Is it returnable on demand?
QUESTION*

Returnable on demand, yes.

But

it's to their tax advantage to have the donee, you know,
being in a lower bracket —
MR. RIGGS*

Yes, Your Honor.

I think, first,

12

Lucas v. Earl would tax the income still to the grantor

13

of the loan.

14
15
16
17

Second, again —

QUESTION*

You say the income would be taxable

tc the dcnor?
MR. RIGGS*

Yes, sir, under the Lucas versus

Earl case of this Court many, many years back.

18

As to whether or not it’s a gift, again, I 've

19

been concentrating sc hard cn these loans, I would only

20

be speculating. Justice Stevens, and I've learned not to

21

do that already this morning.

22

QUESTION*

Well, what if you turned over

23

$200,000, said, you keep in a savings account.

Would

24

the income on the savings account be taxable to the

25

grantor in your view?

And if so, why isn’t the income
