ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE M. NOBLE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. NOBLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents two issues:

first, whether

12

Congress violated the Constitution's requirement of

13

separation of powers when it appointed the Secretary of

14

the Senate and the Clerk of the House as nonvoting ex

15

officio members of the Federal Election Commission where

16

all the decisions of the Commission are made by six voting

17

members who are appointed by the President and confirmed

18

by the Senate, pursuant to Article II.

19

The second issue is whether, if the FEC is

20

unconstitutional, whether the actions taken prior to the

21

Court's decision should be afforded the fact of validity

22

as was done some 18 years ago in Buckley v. Valeo.

23

The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C.

24

Circuit applied a bright line rule to the separation of

25

powers analysis and effectively said that the mere

1

presence of nonvoting, ex officio agents of Congress on an

2

independent agency of the executive branch was a violation

3

of the separation of powers.

4

After doing so, the court declined to apply the

5

precedent of Buckley v. Valeo, and felt that because this

6

was a defense to an enforcement action it must give the

7

National Rifle Association some relief, and therefore

8

reversed the district court's finding of a violation of

9

the Federal Election Campaign Act.
We believe that the court of appeals erred on

10
11

both issues.

QUESTION:

12

13

Are you also going to address whether

you have authority to represent the FEC here?
MR. NOBLE:

14
15

The court's --

If the Court wishes, I can address

that issue.
The Federal Election Commission was created in

16
17

the wake of Watergate to be independent of the Department

18

of Justice.

19

Federal Election Commission having independent authority

20

to institute actions and to conduct appeals of cases under

21

title II.

22

The statute itself talks in terms of the

The Solicitor General's position on this relies

23

on a narrow reading of the word appeal to not include

24

petitions for writ of certiorari.

MR. NOBLE:

In other words, the Commission can appeal every

I suppose you could give effect to

You could give effect to both those

8

statutes, though I think that would not be giving full

9

effect to the intent of Congress in establishing the

10

Federal Election Commission.
First, I would note that 518(a) also talks about

11
12

the Solicitor General's authority to appeal, and does not

13

specifically mention petitions for writ of certiorari, and

14

this Court has recognized that's a congressional grant of

15

authority, and that Congress can limit that authority in

16

specific instances.

17

QUESTION:

18

Here, where you have -You don't think the word suits in

that statute helps the Attorney, the S.G.?

19

MR. NOBLE:

As a general proposition, absent

20

some other declaration by Congress that litigation

21

authority should reside in another agency, yes, I think

22

that does cover it.

23

situation where Congress clearly intended the Federal

24

Election Commission to be independent of the Department of

25

Justice.

But in our instance, we have a

QUESTION:

1

Well, you're saying that appeals in

2

518 indicates that it comprehends writs of certiorari.

3

thought that was your argument.
MR. NOBLE:

4

I

The word appeal generally

5

comprehends writs of certiorari.

6

used in our statute in title II authorizing the Commission

7

to conduct appeals.

8

QUESTION:

9
10

The word appeal is also

But in 518 it says, suits and

appeals.
MR. NOBLE:

Yes, but while that's a general

11

grant of authority to the Solicitor General, we don't

12

believe that it overrides the congressional -- the words

13

of the statute and also the congressional intent to afford

14

the Commission its own litigation authority.

15

QUESTION:

Well, it doesn't override, it, but

16

the point is, the mere fact that your statute says appeals

17

is not contradicted by, or a limited reading of that

18

statute is not contradicted by 518(a), which goes out of

19

its way to say, not just appeals, but the Attorney General

20

represents the United States in suits and appeals.

21

MR. NOBLE:

Yes, Justice Scalia, but again I

22

think if you look at the intent of Congress, the way the

23

statute's constructed, also --

I'm looking at it.

I'm reading

518(a), and I'm reading 9010, and what do you do about

1

9040, which was enacted at the same time as the statute

2

you're relying upon, which does say the Commission is

3

authorized on behalf of the United States to appeal from

4

and to petition the Supreme Court for certiorari to review

5

judgments or decrees entered with respect to actions in

6

which it is presumed to be provided in this section, which

7

is not the present section.

8

to say, not only appeal, but to petition for certiorari.

9

MR. NOBLE:

There it goes out of its way

That provision was not enacted at

10

the same time as the Federal Election Campaign Act.

11

fact, that provision came into being in 1971, prior to the

12

Commission even being created, and then what happened in

13

1974 when the Commission was created, that statute was

14

just modified to substitute the Commission for the

15

Comptroller General, and we don't think that Congress had

16

any intent in doing that.

1

effect what you have is two statutes created at two

2

different times, and they were originally created for two

3

different agencies, and so we think that the looking at

4

title 26 as a proscription on title 2 authority is

5

inappropriate in this situation.

6

7

QUESTION:

Also, though --

How many other agencies have the

authority to petition here without the S.G.?

8

MR. NOBLE:

9

QUESTION:

Excuse me, I'm -How many other agencies, or how many

10

agencies, perhaps I should say, have the authority to

11

petition here without the S.G.?

12

MR. NOBLE:

I'm aware of -- there -- I'm not

13

specifically sure.

14

agencies, and there are situations where agencies have

15

voluntarily given, or ceded authority to the S.G. to

16

petition this Court.

QUESTION:

I think there are a couple of other

Do you know what the other agencies

are that you think have that authority?

Beyond that, I'm not sure.

Doesn't the FTC have the same, a

similar statute to yours?
MR. NOBLE:

I don't know that it has the same

exact language, and it clearly does not have the same

25

legislative history with regard to the intent of the

1

Federal Election Commission to be independent of the

2

Department of Justice.

3

If I can address for a moment the question of

4

title 26, and how -- the reading that title 26 gives the

5

FEC authority while title 2 does not would result in what

6

we consider a conflicting scheme, because under title 26

7

and under title 2, the Federal Election Commission can

8

bring suits for injunctive relief for violations of the

9

public financing statutes.

10

And under the Solicitor General's position, we

11

would have a situation that if the FEC cited title 2, the

12

Solicitor General would have authority in the Supreme

13

Court, if the FEC cited title 26 as its authority, the FEC

14

would have authority in the Supreme Court, and if the

15

SEC -- if the FEC, as is probably most likely, would cite

16

both statutory sections, then you would have conflicting

17

authority in the Supreme Court, and we suggest that that

18

is not the scheme that Congress intended.

19

The -- what runs throughout our statute, the

20

creation of our statute, was the idea that the Federal

21

Election Commission confined itself in litigation involved

22

with a sitting President, or a sitting President's

23

opponent, and that there should be independence from the

24

Department of Justice, from the Attorney General.

25

QUESTION:

Well, the statute in title 26

1

expressly gives the FEC authority.

2

these statutes could be read so as to say the FEC does not

3

have authority to petition this Court in this case today.

4

If we were to say that, do you think that the subsequent

5

permission given by the Solicitor General could possibly

6

cure the jurisdictional problem?

QUESTION:

I suppose that all

Yes.
Because the consent wasn't given

until long after the petition was filed.
MR. NOBLE:

10

Yes.

The petition was clearly filed

11

within time.

12

puts a time limit on when the Solicitor General can

13

authorize a petition to be filed, and I think the

14

Solicitor General would be in a better position to speak

15

to that issue, but we don't see anything, and nothing's

16

been cited that would limit the Solicitor General's

17

authority to authorize the petition.

There is nothing that we read in 518(a) that

QUESTION:

So 2 years can go by, and we really

19

don't know whether the case is here or not until the

20

Attorney General chooses to retroactively give life to the

21

suit?

22

That doesn't seem -- it's very strange to me.
MR. NOBLE:

Well, I don't think you would have a

23

situation, because the Court would rule on the petition,

24

presumably, before that point, but I don't think that's a

25

situation - 10

QUESTION:
2

After we've ruled on the petition, and we rule that the

3

agency is not properly represented, the Attorney General

4

at that point cannot give life to the suit, right, but any

5

time up to then, we really don't know until he speaks

6

whether the suit is properly here or not?

7
8
9

MR. NOBLE:

I -- that is a possibility.

That is

not the situation you have in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe the Clerk should just

10

refuse to accept the filing in the first instance, if it

11

comes in here without the Solicitor General's

12

participation, and that ends it.

13
•l

MR. NOBLE:

Well, I -- that would end it.

I

think one of the problems you have in this case is that
15

for approximately 18 years the Federal Election Commission

16

has exercised what I think many presumed was its own

17

independent litigating authority, so there was no question

18

in this case earlier on that -- whether we had the

19

authority, and no previous Solicitor General has ever

20

raised an objection, so I think everybody just assumed

21

that the Federal Election Commission did, in fact, have

22

the authority.

Oh, at least there's that in mind.

1

MR. NOBLE:

Yes.

2

If I may move on to the first substantive issue

3

in the case,

the court's application of the bright line

4

test is contrary to the functional analysis that this

5

Court has used with regard to separation of powers cases,

6

and that functional analysis requires the Court to look at

7

whether or not there has been aggrandizement of power by

8

one branch,

or interference with the exercise of power by

another branch.
10

In this case, we have a threshold question:

11

the ex officios exercise any power?

12

provides that the ex officio members of the Commission

13

have no vote on the Commission.

And might not those discussions be

2

less than full and frank in the presence of those two

congressional representatives?

4

MR. NOBLE:

Whatever influence they would have

5

to chill the discussions would be very minimal,

6

considering the fact that this agency, as all agencies,

7

works under the Freedom of Information Act, the Sunshine

Act, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, so the

Commissioners do not sit at a meeting with an

10

understanding that what they say will forever be secret.

QUESTION:

Rather, what you're dealing

But if you're right, your opponent

6

suggests that Congress could put ex officio members on

this Court to sit in our conference, and under your

theory, that's okay, because all they can do is discuss it

with us.

10

That's all right.
MR. NOBLE:

No, Justice O'Connor, we think that

11

that proposition is really based on an untenable

12

proposition by the respondents, which is that what is good

13

for an independent agency created by Congress and placed

14

in the executive branch by necessity is good for this

15

Court or the President.

violation of separation of powers if Congress were to send

MR. NOBLE:

2

Because the same rights that attach

to either the President or this Court do not necessarily

Well, I -- if you cannot draw the

line, then I think there would also be a problem with the

application of the Freedom of Information Act and the

Sunshine Act to independent agencies, because clearly the

11

courts have gone out of their way to not apply, for

12

of the President, saying that to do so would raise serious

MR. NOBLE:

on a functional approach, and I would start with the

proposition that there is a distinction with the Federal

I would also note that, even today, the Clerk of

the House and the Secretary of the Senate have - - receive

all reports for candidates for those bodies, and then have

7

to submit those reports to the FEC, so there is a clear

overlap between the authority of the FEC and, while the

FEC has to independently exercise that authority, Congress

10

believed that the FEC would be served by the advice of the

1

administrative investigations are discussed, and members

2

of the public are not allowed to appear in those sessions.
However, as a practical matter, their influence

3
4

is really limited to the ability to give advice.

The

5

statute puts no burden on the agency to follow that

6

advice, to explain why it's not following that advice; it

7

doesn't require the agency to delay a decision if the

8

Commissioners, voting Commissioners disagree with the ex

9

officio members.
Unlike some other statutes that the lower courts

10
11

have upheld, there is no leverage that the ex officios

12

have, other than the leverage that exists with this agency

13

and every agency, which is the leverage of oversight.

QUESTION:

Is it correct to say they're part of

the decisional process?
MR. NOBLE:

16

They are part of the deliberative

process in the same sense that when the time comes to make

19

that decision, what is very, what is as a practical matter

very clear to everybody is that they have no vote, because

1

right to speak is overridden by the fact that they have

2

absolutely no vote, and also the fact that we are subject,

3

as the court of appeals below noted, to normal oversight,

4

and the -- which can include hearings, can include private

5

meetings with Commissioners, and all of that is much more

6

-- has much more weight on an agency, on every agency,

7

than just the sitting of the ex officio members.
QUESTION:

8
9

Is there any rule of the Commission

or any rule generally that would prohibit one of these

10

members from speaking to one of the voting members on the

11

way down the hall before the meeting starts?

12

MR. NOBLE:

13

QUESTION:

No.
So there wouldn't be anything that

14

would prevent such a member from saying, you know, 37

15

Senators are going to be furious if you go after so-and-

16

so, on the way into the meeting?
MR. NOBLE:

17

No, but -- but that doesn't

18

really -- is not necessarily a function of sitting at the

table.

20

QUESTION:

Well, but it's also a function that

21

the general public doesn't get to perform, either.

22

don't walk down the hall from their offices to the meeting

They

1

2

public wouldn't have.
MR. NOBLE:

Yes.

There is that opportunity, but

3

again, I think that opportunity pales in comparison to the

4

opportunity, when the tapes are made public, for Congress

5

in oversight functions to see what the agency has done.

6

As a practical matter, all they can do is say

7
8
9

what they think, and that's where it stops.
What I'd like to just briefly say is that in
terms of the remedy involved in this case, make two very

10

quick points.

One is that what we're asking for is the

11

application of Buckley v. Valeo, and to find that the

12

agency was, in fact -- all the actions of the agency were,

13

in fact, de facto valid, and second, that we wanted to

14

point out that contrary to the NRA's position, there is a

15

remedy in this case.

16

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Noble.

17

Mr. Bender, we'll hear now from you.

you might touch briefly on the de facto matter which you,

I believe you argue in your brief.

1

position, as you know from the brief we filed in response

2

to the Court's invitation, that the Commission does not

3

have independent litigating authority.

4

The right procedure, I think, would be for the

5

Clerk to reject the brief or petition filed by an agency

6

without such authority, and ask the Solicitor General

7

whether the Solicitor General in fact authorizes the

8

petition.

9

In this case, we did, in response to the Court's

10

question, authorize the petition.

11

authorization is valid.
QUESTION:

12

13

I think that

I guess we have accepted petitions

from the FEC in the past that weren't authorized.

14

MR. BENDER:

15

QUESTION:

Yeah, and I think that's -There seems to be kind of a practice

16

of it, so it's quite understandable that the Clerk

17

accepted this one, I suppose.

18

MR. BENDER:

Right, and I think it's also

19

understandable that the FEC did not ask us for authority

20

before filing its petition.

21

the day before they filed it as a matter of courtesy.
QUESTION:

22

They notified us, I believe,

Well, how would the subsequent

23

consent or authorization relate back?

thing isn't properly filed, isn't that the end of the

25

matter?

MR. BENDER:

1

It

no, I don't think so.

It's

2

similar to the practice that's followed throughout the

3

appellate courts of the United States with regard to

4

notices

of appeal.
Agencies of the United States often file

5
6

protective notices of appeal without first getting the

7

Solicitor General's authorization because time does not

8

permit that, and after the notice of appeal is filed,

9

Solicitor General often authorizes the appeal and it goes

10

the

ahead.
QUESTION:

11

But now, is that the same sort of

12

statutory situation that you have in petitions to this

13

Court?2

14

MR. BENDER:

I think it is.

The Solicitor

15

General has the same authority to authorize appeals by the

16

United States as it does to authorize participation in

17

this Court.

18

QUESTION:

So a U.S. Attorney filing a notice of

19

appeal from the district court to the court of appeals,

20

you say that notice of appeal would be, not be any good so

21

far as the court was concerned, unless the S.G. approved

22

it?

23

MR. BENDER:

I think the appeal would not be any

24

good, unless the Solicitor General approved, authorized

25

the going forward with the appeal, but I think the

approval does not have to be given before the time for the

notice of appeal to be filed, because of the time

pressure.

QUESTION:

saying that they are invalid?
MR. BENDER:

6

In the courts of appeals you're

No, no.

I'm saying that they are

7

valid, even though the authorization comes after the

8

filing of the notice of appeal.

9

QUESTION:

They are valid because the U.S.

10

Attorneys have authorization to proceed immediately,

11

without the prior consent of the Solicitor General, so

12

they have authorization.

13

the Justice Department is to give them authorization to

14

file appeals.

IS

18

MR. BENDER:

You're saying the practice of

practice.

authorization to file petitions for certiorari?2

MR. BENDER:

QUESTION:

21

MR. BENDER:

I think no.
Then it's not a parallel situation.
In light -- I agree it's not an

22

entirely parallel situation, but in light of what Justice

O'Connor mentioned, that is the general understanding that

we only authorize it after --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. BENDER:

5

QUESTION:

Is it the case that --- the petition is filed.
-- when a person reasonably believes

6

he is an agent, he is an agent?

7

MR. BENDER:

I think it's -- I wouldn't analyze

8

it as a technical question of the law of agency.

I would

9

analyze it as a question of whether the jurisdictional

10

limits on the filing of the petition were met in this

11

case, and I think that since an agency of the United

12

States did file a petition and signify their intention to

13

go forward with the case, and since we relatively promptly

14

authorized that petition after the Court noticed the

15

problem, it should be deemed to relate back, and you

16

shouldn't apply technical concepts of the law of agency to

17

the question.

18

There's no unfairness here to the respondents.

19

They had notice that the petition was being filed at the

20

time.

21

QUESTION:

You can say that about any agency

22

coming here without the approval, that there was no

23

unfairness because the respondent knew that the agency was

24

filing a petition for certiorari, but that doesn't get you

25

over the hurdle.

MR. BENDER:

1

I think, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

2

in a case where it was clear that the agency did not have

3

the authority, a case might be made that the petition

4

should be deemed out of time, but I think it's important

5

to take into account here the reality that this Court had

6

in the past --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. BENDER:

9
10

Well, but I --- accepted those petitions.

Excuse me.
QUESTION:

I thought it was clear here,

11

according to your brief, that the agency does not have

12

that authority.

13

MR. BENDER:

It was -- it is clear to us that

14

they do not, but the agency might very reasonably have

IS

thought that they did, because in the past they have filed

16

petitions without authorizations from the Solicitor

17

General and the Court has gone ahead and granted the

18

petitions and heard the cases on the merits.

19

QUESTION:

So is there an agency theory that if

20

you reasonably think you have authority you're more likely

21

to have it than if you don't, is that the --

22

MR. BENDER:

I don't think you should analyze

23

this as a matter of agency theory.

I think you should

analyze it as the correct interpretation of the Court's

jurisdictional limits on the time of filing a petition,

and I think if it is unclear whether the agency has the

2

authority, and the agency reasonably believes it has the

3

authority, and the Solicitor General's authorization is

4

given relatively promptly afterwards, that there's nothing

5

that prevents you from having that authorization relate

back.

QUESTION:

with FEC on the merits and say that this is a violation of

separation of powers.

Yes.

MR. BENDER:

-- the Appointments Clause is a

8

theirs.

9

that the Court should follow the same practice it followed

10

Our view is similar to

We agree with the FEC with regard to the remedy,

in Buckley and Valeo.
In Buckley and Valeo the Court went out of its

11
12

way, even though it held that the structure of the

13

Commission was unconstitutional, to delay its mandate for

14

30 days in order not to interrupt enforcement of the

15

provisions, the substantive provisions that the Court

16

sustains.

17

QUESTION:

Of course, in Buckley, the thing was

18

just a declaratory judgment, so the mandate was really

19

meaningless anyway.

20

MR. BENDER:

Right, and this challenge should

21

also have been a declaratory judgment, and if it had been

have before the Federal Election Commission when they were

8

considering the bringing of the enforcement action against

9

them.

10

And so a structural challenge like this,

11

especially in light of Buckley, which says that

12

enforcement can go forward even though the structure is

13

unconstitutional, I think Buckley holds that that kind of

14

challenge should be made not in an enforcement proceeding

15

but in a declaratory judgment proceeding.

16

QUESTION:

Buckley holds that if it's made in a

17

declaratory judgment proceeding you don't issue an

18

immediate -- but it -- I don't know that Buckley holds

19

that it should be brought, it must be brought in a

20

declaratory judgment proceeding.

21

MR. BENDER:

No, but -- although Buckley holds

22

that if made in a declaratory judgment proceeding, it

23

operates only prospectively.

24
25

Buckley further holds that pending enforcement
proceedings, indeed, enforcement proceedings that weren't

be interfered with.

4

and I think if you read that in connection with this case,

5

the conclusion is inevitable that you cannot raise this as

6

a defense in the pending enforcement proceeding.

7

That's a holding of Buckley, also,

Now, one technical difficulty with that, I

8

should point out, is that there is a declaratory judgment

9

proceeding in the FEC statute, section 437h, and it is --

10

the procedures are very similar to the procedures that

11

happened in this case, but there is a technical

12

difference.

13

Under the declaratory judgment procedure in the

14

statute, the district court is not to decide the

15

constitutional question.

16

the court of appeals en banc.

QUESTION:

It is to refer it immediately to
That didn't happen here.

Why do you refer to it as a technical

difference?

MR. BENDER:

It's a difference in the -- it's a

difference in the procedures that take place.

21

think it affects the ability of this Court to consider the

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that this is not

a proper defense to an enforcement action?
MR. BENDER:

Yes, right.

I think Buckley holds

5

that, that this is not a proper defense in an enforcement

6

action, because Buckley holds that --

7

QUESTION:

So if there's a constitutionally

8

defective structure, constitutionally defective entity

9

that brings an enforcement action against you, that

10
11

constitutional defect is not a defense?
MR. BENDER:

Right.

I think that's the holding

12

of Buckley, and also the holding of Northern Pipeline with

13

regard to similar-type structural defects in the

14

bankruptcy courts.

15

QUESTION:

Well, that really seems quite a weird

16

result, that you can be proceeded against by an agency

17

that is totally improperly constituted but you can't raise

that as a defense to the proceeding.

19

MR. BENDER:

I think that's what Buckley holds,

20

and I don't think it's that weird, because -- I think that

21

should not apply in a case where there is demonstrated

22

prejudice from the structural defect, but I think the

23

basis for Buckley's holding that, and I think it is

sensible, is that when there isn't any prejudice from it,

Well, I can see how you'd say that,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COOPER:

16
17

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

18
19

Thank you, Mr. Bender.

I should like to speak only for a moment on the
jurisdictional question that the Court has discussed.
Our position is this case is JOT and, Mr.

20
21

Justice Scalia, I think your point regarding this issue

22

going away if the Court rules on the cert petition is not

23

the case, because in this case the Court ruled on the cert

24

petition and granted it, and obviously the issue is still

25

here.

The issue is a jurisdictional one.

1

The

2

Solicitor General says that he can retroactively approve a

3

cert petition filed by the Federal Election Commission,

4

says that is like a protective notice of appeal.

5

Justice Scalia, your points were right on target in that

6

regard.

7

protective notice of appeal filed without the Solicitor

8

General's approval.

9

case is jurisdictionally out of time.

10

I think,

My own experience is there's never been a

QUESTION:

The point, Your Honor, again is this

Was it -- it was filed within 90 days

11

by the FEC, and then there's, I gather a justice for good

12

cause can extend it for 60 days in addition under the

13

statute, at least as I read that.

14

that is right, was the approval given by the S.G. within

15

that 60 days or outside of that 60 days, too?

16

MR. COOPER:

Is that right, and if

Justice Breyer, it was given

17

outside of the 60-day period of time, so there's no

18

understanding of the time limits of this Court, of which I

19

am aware anyway, that would bring the authorized petition

20

within the time limits of this Court, so if it is -- if

21

the Court has jurisdiction, it must be because the

22

Solicitor General is empowered after the fact to authorize

23

the petition.

24

And of course if -- in this case it would mean
that the Solicitor General has the power to decide not to

QUESTION:

There is a difference, Mr. Cooper.

I

suppose that ex officio members on this Court would invade

10

our independent authority, but your theory is a little

11

different, I think.

12

that the Congress is aggrandizing itself or enhancing its

13

own powers by putting its people on another branch.

Your theory is one of aggrandizement,

It

seems to me the theory is different in the two cases.
14

15

MR. COOPER:

Well, Your Honor, I think actually

16

our theory is both that Congress is invading the

17

executive's domain, and it is doing so in a way that

18

aggrandizes its own, so I believe we have the benefit of

19

all of this Court's separation of powers jurisprudence.

20

QUESTION:

As to the invasion point, it seems to

21

me rather clear that we would react rather promptly if

22

somebody said somebody's going to sit on our conferences,

23

and it's interesting to me that for some 20 years or so,

24

the FEC doesn't seem to have been bothered at all by the

presence of these members.

In the next breath, they quite frankly admit

6

that the congressional agents are on the Commission for

7

the purpose of representing the Congress, and for the

8

purpose of influencing the Commission through their sound

advice, so not only has the Congress stripped the

10

President of a purely Article II function, enforcement of

11

law, and placed it in a Commission, if the Commission is

12

right, that is free from the President's control, but it

13

has also installed on that agency two agents of its own

our submission that if Congress is going to place

That's the only point you're making --

when you have principal officers who control a Commission

enforcement of a Federal regulatory statute, including the

ability to get penalties as the Commission did in this

But supposing you let the President

Congress and passing messages from Congress to the

MR. COOPER:

11

Oh, well, under those circumstances

12

I think the objectionable features would be drawn out very

thin.

QUESTION:

So it's the fact that the two

11

not sure it isn't a problem, but I think the case against

the Attorney General's ex officio membership on the

activities that the Sentencing Commission performs are

themselves not activities that the executive branch can't

17

They are executive, quasi judicial, quasi

So that you say that -- would you say

that there's an ongoing violation of the structural nature

10

because those attorneys are under the supervision of the

11

Commission which has these ex officio members on it?

12

that your theory?

13

MR. COOPER:

Oh, yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

Is

I think

14

that however murky it may be regarding the ex officio, the

15

participation of the ex officios in investigatory

16

activities, it's not murky at all that a complaint filed

17

for the purpose - - by a Government agency for the purpose

18

of effecting a civil penalty for a violation of the

19

Federal regulatory statute is an executive action, and so

20

that is what this Commission was disqualified by the

21

Constitution from doing, because --

22

QUESTION:

Why would this disqualify it?

I

23

mean, you've got six people, and they were the only six

24

people who could vote, and they're clearly all right.

MR. COOPER:

They are, Your Honor, but this

Why isn't the proper way to characterize the

19

Therefore, the clear unconstitutionality is the activity,

20

the presence of the ex officio members.

21

that unconstitutionality is, in fact, to declare it and,

22

if there were need, to enjoin any further participation by

them.

whether in fact that happened and, if it didn't happen, or

constitutionality is cured, the remedy is prospective, and

that's the end of the case.

MR. COOPER:

Therefore, the question is, find out

Your Honor, it wouldn't because, at

10

least it is our submission that the Commission was

11

constituted such that it was disqualified from enforcing

It was disqualified from bringing this --

QUESTION:

You'd have a stronger argument if you

didn't have a severance provision, wouldn't you?
MR. COOPER:

15

Your Honor, I don't think so.

I

16

think that the severance provision allows for the

17

correction of this statute and it to go forward without

18

further involvement of the Congress, but it does seem to

19

me that those acts it has taken which were invalid, which

20

were void, can't just be somehow deemed valid, and that --

21

QUESTION:

That's a way of characterizing the

case.

MR. COOPER:

Their acts were not invalid, but

the acts of the Commission itself were invalid because of
the presence - QUESTION:

Does it have anything to do with

12

whether their acts are invalid?

I thought it simply had

13

to do with whether the statute continues to subsist as an
operational statute.

MR. COOPER:

That's what the severance point I

think has to do with it, Your Honor, but -QUESTION:

So you can cut out a piece of the

statute and let the rest continue to operate, as opposed

19

to saying the whole statute's null and void.

if these ex officios had had voting power, but only two

2

out of eight, they couldn't have coerced or compelled the

3

Commission, and it may well have been that they voted

4

against this action, but in my opinion, that would clearly

5

make it, the Commission itself, void.
QUESTION:

6

Well, it would make it, because your

7

argument would still be an influence argument, just as it

8

is here.

10

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, my argument is a facial

challenge.
QUESTION:

11

You can't compel with -- two out of

12

six does not compel, nonvoting two out of six does not

13

compel, but your argument would be essentially the same,

14

wouldn't it?

15

MR. COOPER:

My argument is not an as-applied

16

argument, it is a facial challenge based upon the

17

membership of the ex officios, not upon whether or not

18

they actually influenced this case in a way against my

19

clients.

20

If the statute had said all of the Federal

21

Election Commission members will be white, then that would

22

be an invalid Commission, and the acts taken against me,

23

even if they would have been taken by a perfectly

24

constitutional Commission, would be void, in my opinion,

25

and I would have a valid defense.

QUESTION:

Well, you think of a facial attack as

2

being associated with the First Amendment.

Other than

3

that, to talk about something being void or invalid and

something like that, it's not always that clear that it's

5

totally across the board.

MR. COOPER:

9

surely it would follow, I would submit, that the criminal

10

prosecution of the defendants in that case would have had

11

to be dismissed.

that void independent counsel, or even by an independent

13

counsel at that point somehow constitutionally repaired to

go forward.

And that's what our submission is here, that the

Court really, if we are correct on the merits, and the
