ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals in this case invalidated a

12

longstanding regulation of the Secretary of the Interior

13

that interprets the term "harm" as that term is used in

14

the Endangered Species Act's prohibition against the

15

taking of listed species.

16

statutory term "harm" to mean an act which actually kills

17

or injures wildlife.

18

The regulation defines the

The second sentence elaborates upon that basic

19

definition in one particular circumstance.

20

that harm includes significant habitat modification or

21

degradation that actually kills or injures wildlife by

22

significantly impairing its essential behavioral patterns,

23

including breeding, feeding, or sheltering.

24
25

It provides

The court of appeals invalidated this regulation
on its face.

The court concluded that the take

1

prohibition in section 9 of the act applies only to the

2

direct applications of force against wildlife.

3

Respondents argue for a comparably narrow interpretation

4

saying that the take prohibition, including harm, applies

5

only to conduct that is purposeful and directed at

6

wildlife.

7

are wrong.
A party challenging a regulation on its face

In our view, both of these narrow constructions

bears a very heavy burden of showing that no circumstances

10

exist under which the regulation may be valid.

11

case, we submit that respondents have failed to show that

12

Congress categorically excluded those deaths or injuries

13

to protected wildlife that result from habitat

modification.

QUESTION:

In this

Would you tell us preliminarily,

16

Mr. Kneedler, what the mens rea requirement is under this

statute?

MR. KNEEDLER:

For a criminal violation --

Yes.

The statute

21

specifically requires in section 11(b) that the person

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

The person must -- need not

know that.

in 1978 to change the scienter from wilfully to knowingly,

6

to change it from a specific intent crime to a general

7

intent crime.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

In fact, Congress specifically amended the act

But why wouldn't a defendant in a

criminal case have to know that a particular animal was
endangered?
MR. KNEEDLER:

11

That is a question of knowledge

12

of the law which is nor ordinarily required.

13

required, though, under our interpretation of knowingly,

14

is that the person must know that the conduct in which he

15

is engaging will have the prescribed effect on the

16

protected wildlife.

17

there is significant habitat modification for wildlife,

18

and must know that it will impair the behavioral patterns,

19

such as depriving it of food, depriving it of essential

20

shelter.

21

QUESTION:

What is

In other words, he must know that

Well, do you think that our holding

22

in X-Citement Video bears on the interpretation of the

23

mens rea requirement?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, in X-Citement Video, the

Court made clear, I believe, that it was not necessary

1

that the person know that the material was obscene in the

2

legal sense, but what the person did have to know was the

3

general character of the material in terms of its

4

displaying explicit sexual acts involving minors.

5

So here we believe what the person has to know

6

is that his conduct will have the effect on the wildlife,

7

but what -- the only thing he doesn't have to know is that

8

the species is listed, and that was what Congress was

9

driving at by changing the mens rea requirement from

10

11

wilful to knowingly.
QUESTION:

But would have to know, for

12

example -- if you drained a pond on your property, you'd

13

have to know that there is a particular frog or

whatever --

1

analysis that the Court applied as a legal matter we

2

believe is correct, because there --

3

QUESTION:

4

there, do you know?

What actual injury or death was found

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

Yes.

The goats and sheep that

6

were permitted to graze there were eating the shoots of

7

the trees on which the protected bird depended for its

8

entire habitat, in fact, for feeding, for shelter, and

9

ultimately for breeding, and we think that this fits very

10

readily into the normal understanding of what the word

11

"harm" means.
QUESTION:

12

What about the word "take"?

Let's

13

start with the word "harm" -- "take."

We have here a

14

statute.

15

provision that says it is unlawful for any purpose -- for

16

any person subject to jurisdiction of the United States to

17

take any protected species within the United States.

The operative provision of the statute is the

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, "take" --

That word goes all the way back, and

to take an animal, it's clear what to take an animal

means, absent a definition.

QUESTION:

1

Historically, I've never heard it

2

used in any other way, to take an animal, to take a

3

species of animal.

Okay.

Step 1.

Then, step 2, you're going to say, but there is

4
5

a definition of "take" in this case.

6

happens to contain the word "harm."

7

The definition

The word "harm," and every other word within

8

that definition, can be interpreted in a way consistent

9

with that old-fashioned meaning of "take," but the agency

10

here has chosen to take that one word,

11

of giving it a meaning consistent with "take," has given

12

it a meaning that makes the word "take" an absolutely

13

inappropriate word to use in that operative provision of

14

the statute.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

16

QUESTION:

"harm," and instead

Well --

You're saying you take an animal when

17

you plow your land and accidentally destroy the habitat of

18

the animal.

19

nobody would use the word in that sense.

You have taken the animal.

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

I mean, nobody --

Well, the concept of "take" may

21

have its -- I think does have its roots in ancient

22

wildlife law as you're describing, but what Congress has

23

done is built upon that an extrapolated from that, and in

24

this --

QUESTION:

Only if you choose to interpret the

word "harm" the way you want to interpret it.

2

interpreted another way that fits perfectly well within

3

the concept of "take."
MR. KNEEDLER:

4

It can be

But Congress -- there were prior

5

Federal wildlife statutes that did not contain the word

6

"harm," in fact did not contain the word "harass."

7

Migratory Bird Treaty Act did not contain either of those

8

words, and yet, for example, in the FMC case we cite in

9

our brief, a corporation was convicted of a crime for

10

The

discharging chemicals into a pond.
The birds landed on it, and died as a result of

landing there.

Now, they died -- it was not in the

classic sense hunting.

statute that didn't contain "harm" --

Was that a case from this Court?
No, it wasn't, it was -- but it

is -QUESTION:

Was that issue specifically raised

within the case?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

It was argued in that case

22

that that wasn't "kill," and the court of appeals in that

case found that it was "kill."

that Congress -QUESTION:

4

But we don't regard a court of

appeals case as any sort of a binding precedent.
MR. KNEEDLER:

5

No, I understand that.

I'm just

describing it in terms of how the predecessor statutes,

7

other statutes on which Congress was presumably building

8

when it added the words "harass" and "harm."

9

If I could, there are -QUESTION:

What was the operative word in that

It was also "take"?

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

It was -- the statute included

"take."

interpreting there was "kill," but --

15
16

It also included "kill," and what the court was

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, this regulation

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

19
20

Yes.

-- "harm" has been on the books since

1975?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

It was promulgated almost

21

contemporaneously with the passage of the act, soon after

22

that, and significantly, then, this Court in its

23

celebrated case in TVA v. Hill concluded in that case,

24

pointed out not only that the construction of the Tellico

25

Dam would have violated section 7 of the act, but that it

1

would have also violated the take prohibition, because it

2

would have destroyed the habitat of the snail darter that

3

was necessary both for breeding, or for spawning, and for

4

feeding.

5

The Court pointed out that the act is pervasive

6

in its protection for species, and pointed out with

7

specific reference to the habitat aspect of the harm

8

regulation, saying we don't see how completion of the dam

9

could other than harm the snail darter, so --

QUESTION:

How has the enforcement of the --

11

that was a case involving the Government, but against --

enforcement against private actors, how has that come

about over the years?

14

explanation of the criminal prosecution prospect, but in

15

fact, what has the enforcement experience been?

16
17
18

MR. KNEEDLER:

Before you were engaged in an

There have only been seven

criminal prosecutions.
What Fish & Wildlife Service typically does is

19

when a problem, or potential problem, has come to its

20

attention, it notifies the landowner and invites the

21

landowner to contact Fish & Wildlife Service, because this

22

is not an absolute prohibition.

or do something that would destroy critical or essential

2

habitat, to apply for a permit and enable the Fish &

Wildlife Service to suggest ways in which that activity

4

could be done in a way that would minimize the harm.

QUESTION:

It's only absolute if Fish & Wildlife

wants it to be absolute.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the Fish & Wildlife

8

regulations in 50 C.F.R. 1732(b) say that Fish & Wildlife

9

shall issue a permit if the statutory criteria --

MR. KNEEDLER:

The Fish & Wildlife regulations.

But they have -- since the

overall thrust of the act to protect the species to ensure

that before someone goes ahead and destroys habitat in a

1

trees in ways that would minimize the taking of

2

protected species.

3

QUESTION:

Because when you take trees, you're

4

taking the owl.

That's the theory of this?

5

note the way you use "take trees."

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

QUESTION:

I mean, I

Well, if I may --

The whole spotted owl thing is based

8

on the notion that people who are harvesting trees are

9

taking owls?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

If I may, on the word "take,"

11

there are other uses of the word "take" that I think are

12

instructive here.

13

"take" that has been brought into this very case is that

14

the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and there the

15

Court has held that "take" does not, in the way

16

respondents are arguing, mean only the physical

17

appropriation of property.

18

that restrict the use of property.

19

QUESTION:

For example, the other use of the word

It also applies to regulations

Is that a realistic assessment of the

20

meaning that was intended in this particular statute by

21

the word "take"?

22

23
24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but there's -- it's a word

with many, many meanings.
QUESTION:

I mean, you could say "take" means to

2

But obviously, that's not the meaning used here.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but the there is -- the

3

word "take" also has a meaning of taking lives.

4

example, one might say that a flood that inundated a

5

valley took 50 lives, and that's not hunting, it is action

6

which has the consequence of eliminating --

7
8

9
10

QUESTION:
a double take.

For

It can mean, too, you know --he did

It can mean a lot of things.

(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

But when you say you "take" an

11

animal, it means you hunt the animal and reduce it to your

12

control by wounding it, by killing it, by harming it.

13

means harming the animal, not harming the forest, which

14

causes the animal to starve to death.

15

taking an animal seems to me just weird.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

It

To say that that's

But if you're harming the animal

17

in a way that affects its essential behavioral

18

characteristics -- for example, take the salmon that would

19

be swimming up the river to spawn.

20

in the river so it can't reach its spawning grounds, the

21

salmon may die in the same period of time, but will not be

22

able to reproduce.

23

If you put a barrier

I think that's "harm" within any meaning of that

24

term, and again, the word "harm" is a statutory term.

25

It's not just "take."

Congress supplied a definition
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

1

which includes "harm," a definition that this Court

2

referred to the way the Secretary had given content to

3

that in TVA v. Hill.
And then, if I may, in 1 82, significantly, and

4
5

this is very important, what Congress did was enact a

6

permit program recognizing, specifically recognizing in

7

the Senate report that "harm" means habitat modification

8

that harms a species.
What Congress did was enact a permit program

10

that permits such takings, incidental takings to go

11

forward, but only in specific circumstances, not that

12

they're entirely outside the act, but resting on the

13

premise that they are covered by the harm regulation.

14

Congress said they may go forward if they are

15

incidental and not the purpose of the conduct, and we

16

think those statutory phrases are inconsistent with

17

respondent's position that "harm" or "take" applies only

18

to purposeful conduct that is aimed at a species such as

1

hunting.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler --

QUESTION:

Because --

I'm sorry.

No, I'm sorry.

1

it's inconsistent because the statutory modification in

2

effect recognized the regulation as being reasonable, I

3

suppose.
MR. KNEEDLER:

4

That's right, and also on the

5

face of the act we think refutes respondent's suggestion

6

that it refers only to such things as hunting that are

7

aimed at or directed at a specific animal --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KNEEDLER:
QUESTION:

10

No, but you don't --- because the statute --

May I just interrupt you?

I take it

11

you're not arguing that in the absence of a regulation the

12

word "harm" would cover what you claim it covers in this

13

case?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, there still might be a

15

question, if the Secretary had given it that

16

interpretation, but here, under Chevron, the Secretary has

17

given it this interpretation for 17 years this Court

18

recognized that Congress responded to it and built upon

19

that, and we think at least under Chevron the word "harm"

20

carries that meaning, and Congress recognized that by

21

saying that you can get a permit to engage in activity

22

that harms a species incidentally, and not for the

23

purpose --

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, the later statutory

modification which acknowledges, let's assume that it

1

does, that it includes habitat modification, I would find

2

that persuasive if what that modification did was add some

3

new restriction or talk about the nature of the

4

restriction that had previously been imposed, but all this

5

amendment does is enable you to get out of the

6

restriction.

7

Let's assume I'm a Congressman who voted for the

8

"take" to mean no citizen in the country can do anything

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, Justice Scalia, in the

background of both the 1978 and 1982 amendments there is

5

no suggestion that this was a crazy interpretation of the

word "harm."

this was a valid interpretation of the word "harm."

was a proposal by Senator Garn to amend "harm" -- to amend

"take" to exclude forestry practice --

If Congress enacts a mitigating statute based on what

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, we think the 1982

exemptions that Congress did enact, and enacted under

carefully limited circumstances, to enable the Fish &

Congress added the word "harm," an expansive word, as

were of national importance, both --

understand the other side's argument as categorically

excluding the habitat modification as a step which might

lead to liability.

11

If -- I don't understand the other side to be

12

arguing that if I had a spotted owl nesting in the tree

outside, and I went outside and cut the tree down for the

express purpose of killing the owl, who would go down with

15

the tree and be crushed, that that would be excluded from

It's habitat modification -- I think what

they're arguing is simply that habitat modification which

does not have a purpose to kill or eliminate the species

that deal with civil penalties and criminal penalties, so

3

for an injunctive action you don't need to prove

knowledge, and there's no reason why Congress would have

wanted to show knowledge.

What Congress was focusing on was the impact on

these species which Congress determined to be of national

importance, not the blameworthiness of individuals when it

comes to civil injunctive actions.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Kneedler, do you know of any

11

other Federal criminal statute that provides for an

12

attempt crime that is attached to something other than a

13

purposeful crime, because this definition, which includes

14

"harm" -- the definition of "take" it says means to

15

harass, harm, pursue, hunt, wound, kill, trap, capture, or

16

collect, or to attempt to engage in such conduct.

17
18

Now, what do you mean?

This means to attempt to

cut down a forest?

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think it would encompass a

20

situation if you -- for example, if.you attempted to block

21

passage of salmon to a spawning ground but were

22

unsuccessful, that would be an attempt to harm the salmon

of the definition, or attempt to do any of those things.

15

you would not have to have knowledge, and again, there's

no reason why Congress would have wanted that for an

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. MACLEOD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MACLEOD:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to address three points this morning in

10
11

response to the Government's argument.

First,

I'd like to

12

talk about the text and structure of the act,

13

what "take" means in its statutory context, how it is

14

clear that in section 9 Congress was focused on certain

15

types of conduct, and wasn't attempting to establish a

16

broad,

17

activity based solely on what its injurious effect might

18

be to wildlife.

and show

regulatory authority over any form of human

19

Secondly,

I'd like to talk about some of the

20

hard cases that come up under the statute,

21

so,

22

focuses on effect and not on the types of conduct with

23

which Congress was concerned, will assure that the wrong

24

questions are asked about whether a take occurred in every

25

instance.

and in doing

I want to emphasize that the regulation, because it

Finally, I'd like to say something about the

1

2

1982 amendments and the meaning of incidental take.
The 1973 Congress focused on two threats to rare

3
4

species.

It wanted to stop the destruction of their

5

necessary habitat, and it wanted to stop people from

6

hunting and killing them and trading in them.

7

addressed the habitat destruction issue in sections 5 and

8

7.

It

Those provisions say that that's what they're about.
Section 5 in particular provides a very

9
10

effective means for addressing the very problems that the

11

Secretary claims authority to regulate under section 9.

12

It is a land acquisition authority in which Congress said

13

to the Government, if you need to protect habitat, you

14

have the authority and the funding to do so.
Section 9 has a very different purpose.

15

It

16

zeroed in on the issue of hunting and killing rare

17

animals, and of putting an end to what was becoming a

18

thriving business of trafficking in them, and what it says

19

is very clear.

acts.

Justice Stevens, is when you're dealing with purely

to use the land acquisition authority under section 5.

Now, it's possible, given a particular situation

that if it went to a court, a court might find, in a given

QUESTION:

What I assume to be

-- that in fact purposeful activity

is the norm in this string of verbs, and therefore

activity?

don't want to catch the endangered species.

7

what you want to do, but you know that that is, in fact,

8

what you are going to accomplish, and the statute says, by

9

using the word "knowing," that in fact your knowledge is

11

That's not

sufficient to make you liable under the statute.
I mean, you can't -- it makes no sense, it seems

12

to me, to say that -- for Congress to provide that you

must knowingly commit a purposeful act.

14

has got to be knowing, and if the state of mind is

15

knowing, then there isn't a purposeful element in the

verbs, and if you know that your net is going to pull up

17

the endangered species, that's enough, and that, I

18

suppose, is consistent with the Secretary's regulation,

that if you know the destruction of the habitat is going

to result in the killing and the injury, that's enough.

that argument is that by going to effect, the regulation

adds an element which is not covered by knowing in this

has got to be that this goes beyond merely knowing

number of instances, in which knowing conduct would in

end of your facial challenge, and the most that you could

to cover the case in which you had no reason to know that

9

the representative of the species was going to be hurt,

10
11

MR. MACLEOD:

We believe that the facial

actor is culpable under that standard, we often look to

7

find what are the logical, likely, and natural

8

consequences of the acts, and that's the equation that you

9

want to excise from this analysis, it seems to me, which

10

brings us almost full circle to where we began, asking you

11

how to distinguish this purposeful interpretation you're

12

putting forward from what we often and always do in

13

criminal law and in mens rea analysis.

14

MR. MACLEOD:

Justice Kennedy, we don't say that

15

it's inappropriate or irrelevant to look at effects.

16

just say that you shouldn't look to the effects alone, but

17

under the regulation, that's what you're left with.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. MACLEOD:

So that you can look to the effects.
You can look at the effects as

long as they're one of a number of relevant inquiries

21

under the statute.

3

MR. MACLEOD:

QUESTION:

Correct, Justice Scalia.

But if you engage in an activity

5

which is not a taking activity, you are not knowingly

6

taking.

7

MR. MACLEOD:

8

QUESTION:

9

Correct, Justice Scalia.

So if you're cutting down trees,

you're not knowingly taking, even though you may kill an

10

owl, but if you're shooting some other species, knowing

11

that there are owls in the vicinity, and you shoot an owl,

12

you are knowingly taking an owl.

13

MR. MACLEOD:

That is absolutely correct.

14

would be an incidental take, but it would be a take

15

nonetheless.

16

QUESTION:

That

But that -- but going back to Justice

17

Kennedy's example, you chop down a tree and you know it's

going to fall on someone's house and kill the occupant,

20

down the tree, is that insulated from criminal liability,

to confront is one where you do have that knowledge.

Not of the common --

to kill him, but you would not know you were going to take

him because you were not engaged in a taking activity.

You were cutting down a tree.

effects instead of in terms of conduct.

Congress acted in a way in

It can be purposeful against any species, and if it

spawning and feeding purposes.

It was not directed at the snail darter.

prohibition against take.

The discussion of knowledge, knowledge is

penalties, for civil penalties and criminal penalties,

retrospective penalties for prior conduct.

12

For an injunctive action, you sue for a

Congress would have wanted the scheme to work.

MR. KNEEDLER:

2

of regional or national importance, and then said any such

3

project granted an exemption will also be exempt from the

4

prohibition against taking in section 9 or any

5

implementing regulations.
Given the fact that this Court specifically

6

7

referred to the harm regulation, that reference to

8

regulations can only have been to the harm regulation, and

9

the legislative history to the '78 act shows that that was

true.
And then again in 1982, Congress saying not at

12

all costs, it created the special permit exemption to

13

allow takes to go forward in particular circumstances.

14

But it wasn't just in 1982.

In 1973, the

15

legislative history of the report shows that with respect

to the word "harass" it would allow the Secretary to

regulate, the House report said, whether intentional or

not, regulate or prohibit activities of bird watchers
