ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD W. JENKINS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JENKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
As the briefs indicate, this case turns in large

14

part on whether or not the phrase, by means of a

15

prospectus or oral communication, as used in section 12(2)

16

of the Securities Act of 1933, is a phrase of limitation.

17

The case also turns on whether, by section

18

12(2), the act covers negotiated private transactions even

19

though .the act does not otherwise intrude into such

20

business arrangements.

21

The House report answers both these questions,

22

stating the bill affects only new offerings of securities.

23

It does not affect ordinary redistribution of securities.

24
25

As to liability provisions, the report states
the bill's civil liabilities attach only when there's been

an untrue statement of material fact in the registration

This case involves no new offering of

securities, and presents the paradigm example of a private

6

transaction the act plainly left free from regulation

other than by its section 17.
Art Gustafson, Dan McLean, and Francis Butler

sold their company to a sophisticated investor which

10

conducted its own due diligence and negotiated the deal it

11

wanted.

The buyers had full access to information about

12

Alloyd.

Indeed, Mr. McLean and Mr. Butler were officers

13

and shareholders of the buyer.

14

The stock purchase agreement contained numerous

15

risk-allocating provisions.

16

knew that Alloyd's interim earnings were estimated, so, as

17

is common, they closed with an estimated purchase price

subject to a later dollar-for dollar adjustment after an

19

audit determined actual earnings.

In particular, the parties

They plainly could

After the audit, the parties agreed that the

23

estimated price had been $815,000 too high, and sellers

24

paid that amount to buyers as the agreement required.

now claim that sellers warranted a certain level of such

2

earnings in the agreement.

3

warranty, which is a contract law matter, and also claim a

4

violation of section 2 of the -- 12(2) of the Securities

5

Act.

6

They claim a breach of that

They have made no claim of fraud.
As to the section 12(2) claim they assert, it is

7

that the purchase agreement itself, the negotiated

8

purchase agreement, was a prospectus, and they claim they

9

are entitled to rely on oral communications during due

10

diligence about Alloyd's inventory, even though the

11

agreement specifically provided such oral statements were

12

superseded by the terms of the agreement.

13

Buyers seek rescission of the transaction or

14

rescissionary damages, even though by the agreement they

15

agreed that they would not seek rescission.

16

The act, and section 12(2) in particular, makes

17

a seller, we submit, a fiduciary only when there is an

18

initial public offering of securities.

19

in the context of ordinary secondary transactions such as

20

privately negotiated resales of stock that have never been

21

publicly distributed.

22

It does not do so

A stock purchase agreement memorializing the

23

terms of a negotiated deal is not a prospectus, nor are

24

discussions in the course of due diligence regarding the

25

reliability of inventory estimates.

QUESTION:

1

If it had been an offering

2

circular -- not just a purchase agreement, but would an

3

offering circular fit within the definition of

4

section 2(10)?
MR. JENKINS:

5

An offering circular would

6

certainly be a circular, I think, within the meaning of

7

section 2(10).

8

preceding words in 2(10) is, the very first definition of

9

prospectus is prospectus itself, which as commonly defined

10

It specifically uses that phrase.

But the

then had a public solicitation connotation.
We believe the correct interpretation, as

11

12

demonstrated by numerous portions of the House report and

13

other commentary by draftsman, is, an offering circular is

14

a prospectus when it's used to solicit the public to

15

purchase securities.

16

QUESTION:

But if it's in connection with a

17

private offering, it would not -- is that what you're

18

saying would not?

19

•

MR. JENKINS:

We don't believe that would be the

20

proper definition under 2(10), or, particularly, under

21

section 2(12), given the context of 2(12) as a liability

22

provision in the act.

23

QUESTION:

But 2(10) just says, offers any

24

security for sale.

25

the statute aren't limited to a public offering.

It doesn't -- it's not -- the words of

MR. JENKINS:

The very first word that section

2

2(10) uses is prospectus.

3

is, prospectus, as commonly used then, connoted, or was

4

defined as, a document prepared by a company describing

5

its stock or prospects and inviting the public to

6

subscribe to an issuer.

7

first word used in the definition of prospectus.

8

believe the following words have similar import.

QUESTION:

In defining what a prospectus

That's the

Where is that limitation used?

I

10

mean, suppose you had what might be called an offering

11

circular in connection with this private offering, but it

12

was labeled, prospectus.

13

definition?

14

MR. JENKINS:

Would it then fit within the

We don't believe so, not for

15

section 2(10) purposes, and certainly not for section

16

12(2) purposes, because of their use of the word

17

prospectus, used as a selling document.

18
19

QUESTION:

And you're -- when you say similar

import,, you mean public offering import?

20

MR. JENKINS:

21

QUESTION:

Public offering, yes, Your Honor.

So if this deal has -- no, it would

22

still be -- well, if this deal had been done with the

23

company, the control company issuing new shares, and then

24

Gustafson redeeming the shares that they had originally,

25

then that -- otherwise everything is the same.

That would

Yes.

The buyers got new shares, and

then the sellers redeemed their old shares.

8

think --

9

MR. JENKINS:

I don't

As to the first portion of the

10

transaction, the issuance by Alloyd of new shares to the

11

buyers, the exemption of section, I think it's 4(2) of the

12

act, would exempt that transaction.

13

As to the second portion, a redemption, then, of

14

the seller's shares by the company,

15

also be a 4(2)-exempted transaction, but I'm not certain.

16

But in either event, because there is no public selling,

17

no public offer involved in the transaction, no --

I believe that would

on the sale versus resale.

In other words --

There --

-- I gave you a situation where you

23

the form of a sale of new shares, redemption of old

shares, in the other it's done in the form of just a

direct sale of the
MR. JENKINS:

There is some authority,

3

particularly in the comments of legislators, and I think

4

these are cited in the SIA's brief in particular, for the

5

proposition that the act just does not apply to

6

transactions in old stock, period.

7

Some of the commentary in the House report is

8

inconsistent with that sort of declaration, because the

9

commentary in the House report indicates that if there's a

10

redistribution of old stock either by a company or a

11

control person, that transaction is subject to regulation

12

by the act.

3

To the extent one prefers to rely on the House

4

report, declared rationale, or the Congressmen's

5

statements of intent that the act doesn't apply to resales

6

of old stock at all, I think either way you reach the same

7

result as to the application of section --

8
9

QUESTION:

Yes, but I'm giving you two ways of

doing essentially the same deal.

One, it would involve a

20

resale, and the other would be a first sale, and wholly

21

apart from the private versus public sale, I think you

22

said resales are never included.

they were debating the act.

MR. JENKINS:

1

That is part of our position.

One

2

view that could be taken of the act based on those

3

statements is the act just doesn't apply to resales of old

4

stock, period.

QUESTION:

Yes, but you --

QUESTION:

11

I --

-- and that is enough to interrupt

the act that way?
MR. JENKINS:

12

No, Your Honor.

I think the

13

preferred view is the view that is articulated in our

14

briefs, that the House report carefully lays out how the

15

bill -- the bill -- regulates such transactions.

16

redistribution of old stock looks like a public offering,

17

becomes a public offering, then the act applies.

QUESTION:

Sure.

MR. JENKINS:

I personally also believe that

that is a transaction that the act requires to register.
QUESTION:

Of course.

I'm just saying that

13

there are some secondary offerings that must be

14

registered, so there is no basis in the statute for

15

drawing a distinction simply about whether it's a primary

16

offering or secondary offering.

17

MR. JENKINS:

I think the only basis is the

18

statements over and over in the House report and by

19

legislators --

QUESTION:

There's nothing --

21

MR. JENKINS:

-- it applies to new stock, and

transactions, period.

3

MR. JENKINS:

That's my view as to the proper

position to come down on.
Buyers and the SEC argue that section 12(2)

4

extend far beyond the otherwise limited coverage of the

5

act, and applies to all communications in all contexts

6

involving sales of securities.

7

their briefs is based in part on the 1948 decision of

8

Moore v. Gorman and its progeny.

9

Their argument in both

They reason, as that court did, that section

10

12(2) covers secondary transactions and including private

11

resales, because section 4 exempts such transactions from

12

section 5, but does not exempt such transactions from

13

section 12.

14

Seller's position, of course, is that this begs

15

the initial question, what did section 12(2) intend to

16

regulate in the first instance?

17

not have seen any need to exempt a transaction from

18

section 12(2) if it didn't perceive the transaction as

19

covered- by section 12(2) in the first place.

20

QUESTION:

Plainly, Congress would

Well, Mr. Jenkins, I guess the

21

problem is that the language of the section 12(2) does say

22

that any person who offers or sells a security by means of

23

a prospectus or oral communication which includes an

24

untrue statement is liable, so the language itself, of

25

course, is broad, as you have to concede.

MR. JENKINS:

1

I respectfully do not so concede.

2

The language itself is limiting language.

meant to say it broadly, it would have said, any

4

communication, or it would have said nothing, as it did in

section 17 of the act.

7

Section 17 says, you shall not
That is a

When they put the phrase, by means of a

8

9

If Congress had

prospectus or oral communication in section 12(2), they

10

had to be connoting some limitation.

We believe the

11

limitation is the limitation that flows from the natural

12

lay understanding of the term prospectus, which is a

13

document soliciting the public to subscribe to an issue of

14

stock.

15

We don't think section 2(1) requires that you go

16

any differently and, indeed, if it does, as the buyers are

17

attempting to read section 2 (10), why did Congress not

18

simply use the word, any written communication or

19

broadcast in section 2(10)?

20

that.

21

It used many more words than

We think that the usage of all of the words have

22

to be read together in light of the initial word,

23

prospectus, as further communications which are used to

24

solicit the public to purchase securities.

1

in a way that's contrary to the definition in the statute,

2

you define oral communication the same way, by sort of

3

guilt by association, right?

4

oral communication.

5

mean something less than an oral communication?

How do you get oral communication to

MR. JENKINS:

6

It does say, prospectus or

Certainly by guilt by association,

7

or noscitur a sociis, or whichever term you want to put on

8

it, and by the reverse reasoning that also applies to

9

section 2(10).

If they meant any communication, why

10

didn't they just simply say so?

11

that way.

12

they used more words than just, any communication, they

13

were connoting limitation.

14

They knew how to write

That's the way they wrote section 17.

When

We have articulated in our briefs where we

15

believe the limitation leads.

16

in the position of necessarily being all or nothing.

17

it's totally unlimited, their view is the phrase does

require application to every communication in every

19

context' involving securities.

The words used when the act was passed were,

That is treating and describing a specific type of

2

communication, not a negotiated stock purchase agreement

3

and not comments made during the course of due diligence,

4

which the parties agreed were superseded by the stock

5

purchase agreement.

6

QUESTION:

One of the briefs in support of

7

respondents said -- discussed section 410(a)(2) of the

8

Uniform Securities Act, said it was similar to 12(2), and

9

said that the consensus among the States is contrary to

10

your position.

11

and secondary market transactions are covered.

12

The consensus is that both private sales

MR. JENKINS:

Well, 4 -- the section of the

13

Uniform Securities Act that they're referring to does not,

14

specifically does not include the phrase, by means of a

15

prospectus or oral communication.

16

out of that act.

Those words are left

17

Certainly, with those words left out,

18

they're correct the Uniform Securities Act does apply to

19

such transactions, but it's an awfully big distinction.

20

mean, they're saying the things mean the same even though

21

the '33 act has words of limitation in them that the

22

uniform act does not have.

23

QUESTION:

I thought perhaps the reason for the

24

use of the word prospectus is it's a term of art, which is

You know, it defines prospectus as any

prospectus, notice, circular, advertisement, letter, or

4

communication, but then it specifically says, by the way,

5

two things are not prospectuses, and that's if you comply

6

with certain SEC rules and so forth, so the reason that

7

they wouldn't say, any written communication, is they

8

wanted to tie it directly to that definition.

so much easier to do.

still believe the same result would be reached if they'd

I find it very odd that the limitation that

Why all the way down, by saying, who offers or

It's a very strange way to do it.

MR. JENKINS:

I think the reason that Congress

the statute, if you look at how the statute is drafted

21

it's clear that the whole statute only applies to public

superfluous.

MR. JENKINS:

Two answers.

different and significantly broader, as this Court

observed in United States v. Naftalin.
Second, there is specific commentary in the

intent that section

that it was applicable to secondary transactions.

Does that silence suggest that

section 12 applies to transactions that do not have to be

MR. JENKINS:

We believe not.

We know that

from the language that got added to section 12(2).

13

QUESTION:

That is pretty clear

The point is that the style of the

act does use exemptions in section 4, exempting one

section from another.

16

MR. JENKINS:

That's correct in terms of

exempting transactions, if you will, and securities, from

5

1

Mr. Kopecky, in 2( 0), after it says,

the term prospectus means any prospectus, et cetera, et

say that an, simply an agreement of sale signed by both

11

MR. KOPECKY:

12

I think in this

Why is that?
Well, the agreement here was the

culmination of a long process.

The agreement included

3

specifically representations by the sellers that were made

4

as an inducement, and that's in the language of the

5

agreement itself, as an inducement to the buyers to buy

6

the stock, so the agreement itself was part of the selling

process.

I assume because of its

The attorneys' fees would be hard

10

for the plaintiff to get in this case, so I don't think

11

that's a motivating factor.

12

The negligence standard is obviously a benefit,

so it is true that in those categories of cases where

14

there's an overlap between section 12(2) and 10(b)-5, a

15

plaintiff would prefer to sue under 12(2), just as in the

context of a registered public offering of securities, if

there's a misstatement in the registration statement, the

plaintiff in that case would much prefer to sue under

have to prove fraud.

MR. KOPECKY:

1

The answer to that statement is

2

not clear from the legislative history, so I can only

3

speculate, but let me offer a couple of explanations.
One, this statute was basically walking into new

4
5

territory.

There had not been significant regulation of

6

the securities industry.

7

Congress to have started with some terms that were known

8

and commonly used, prospectus, circular, notice, and then

9

worked from that in increasing breadth, ending with the

I think it is reasonable for

10

term, written communication.

Could they have simply said

11

any communication, or any written communication?

12

certainly could have.

They

I think a second explanation is that, as pointed

13
14

out in the Solicitor General's brief, we know that the

15

draftsmen started with the British Companies Act as a

16

model, and the British Companies Act has a definition of

17

prospectus that starts out similarly to the definition of

18

this case.

19

.

However, in this case the drafters diverted

20

significantly, because the British Companies Act referred

21

to public offerings of securities.

22

from the definition of prospectus by the Congress that

23

enacted the '33 act.

transaction?
MR. KOPECKY:

2

Under the British Companies Act --

3

well, certainly if we were relying on a prospectus I think

4

we'd have a hard time, because the British Companies Act

5

defines prospectus to include a public offering, so I

6

think we would have a harder case.

7

I do not have clearly in mind what the British

8

Companies Act says about oral representations, which is a

9

key part of our case here, so I don't know if we could win

10

under that statute.

Kennedy's question that was brought up in the SIA brief,

firm?

23

MR. KOPECKY:

I think it is far from clear that

24

brokerage research reports would be subject to liability

25

under section 12(2) for a couple of reasons.

First, in

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

order to have liability under section 12(2), you must be a

2

seller.

3

far from clear, I think, that someone who issues a

4

research report is a seller.

You must be a statutory seller.

It's unclear,

In Pinter v. Dahl, this Court explained what it

5
6

means to be a statutory seller under section 12(1).

7

Assume for a minute that definition extends to 12(2) .

8

must either be the person who passes title to the

9

security, or one who solicits the sale for your own

You

10

financial benefit, so someone who issues an analyst's

11

report is not necessarily soliciting anybody to buy stock.
Second, the analyst's report itself would have

12

13

to be a prospectus, and prospectus is defined as a

14

document that offers or confirms the sale of the security.

15

Now, an analyst's report does not offer a

16

security for sale, nor does it confirm the sale of the

17

security, so I think the concerns about open-ended

18

liability for analysts is significantly overblown.

MR. KOPECKY:

Again, the legislative history

explicitly, and we've talked about, during Mr. Jenkins'

2

argument, sections 4(2), 4(1), which create express

3

exemptions from the registration requirement.
There's no comparable exemption from section

5

12(2) and, further, again as Mr. Jenkins pointed out, when

6

Congress meant to exempt a particular type of security

7

from section 12(2), it did that explicitly as well.
So when Congress meant there to be exemptions,

it enacted them.
QUESTION:

10

Does -- Justice Breyer asked you

11

whether one aspect of the definition of prospectus is

carried over into the phrase, oral communication.

about the aspect that requires a prospectus to be in

sold by means of either a written or oral communication

21

means that that statement is made in connection with the

solicitation of the sale.

23

section 12(2) was to focus in on that process by which

2

solicit sales of securities.

3

I want to return to just one other point in the

4

text of section

5

term, oral communication.

6

and most recently in FDIC v. Meyer, that undefined

7

statutory terms are to be given their ordinary, or natural

8

meaning.

2(2) itself, if I may, and that's the
This Court has said repeatedly,

Now, petitioners cannot dispute that giving the

10

words of the statute their ordinary meaning, section

2(2)

11

on its face unambiguously applies to any security sold by

means of a false or misleading oral communication.

There

3

simply is no connotation you can give to oral

4

communication that limits it to a public offering or an

5

initial offering of securities.

6

To the contrary, an oral communication is going

7

to occur most often in the context of a private

8

transaction, a negotiated transaction where people are

9

talking*to each other, so oral communication, it seems, if

you read it just in its natural sense, clearly applies to

all transactions.

It is interesting that in the '34 act there was

7

the primary purpose, was to seek the eradication of

wrote the statute to pick up persons other than mobsters

10

I think the situation here is analogous to RICO,

You can look at the legislative history of

or organized criminals.

11

QUESTION:

A good example.

12

MR. KOPECKY:

And this Court has said, we're

13

going to construe RICO not in light of what was the

14

primary motivation, but the way Congress wrote the

15

statute, and I suggest that's what the Court should do

16

here with section 12(2), is construe the statute the way

Congress wrote it.

with all those unpleasant RICO cases.

MR. KOPECKY:

MR. KOPECKY:

Your Honor --

Your Honor, that's a good point,

23

That tell us something about 1) how the statute

3

should be read, 2) this Court has said on a number of

4

occasions that it is inappropriate to set aside

5

longstanding interpretations of express statutory remedies

that parties have come to rely on, but third, in response

13

MR. KOPECKY:

I think the explanation

8

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In our view, the cause of action provided in

11

section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 does extend to

12

all sales of securities made by means of a prospectus or

13

oral communication that contains a misleading statement,

14

and there is no limitation to initial offerings, initial

15

public offerings, or an exclusion of private transactions

16

or secondary transactions.

17

The key in construing section 12(2) is the

18

phrase, prospectus or oral communication, which is a

19

defined term in the act, and when one looks at the

20

definition in section 2(10) of the prospectus, it's fairly

21

clear that Congress used words that cover a very, very

22

broad range of kinds of communications that offer a

23

security for sale or confirm the sale of a security.

24
25

And as my cocounsel alluded to, the origins of
the statutory definition of prospectus are very revealing,

because they show that the first four terms in that

definition are the same that appear in the British

wrote this act that they used the British Companies Act as

a model.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Dreeben, how do you answer

7

Justice Kennedy's question about section 10, which uses

8

the word, a prospectus, but that is definitely the kind of

9

prospectus that would be part of a registration statement?

10

There, the word prospectus does have a circumscribed

11

meaning.

But I think the most important point here is

20
21

that the structure of the acts, the securities laws as a

whole, reflects that Congress understood the difference

narrower association of prospectus used in a registration

MR. DREEBEN:

To the extent that they are used

Does that mean they have the same

7

high standard of full disclosure that the prospectus that

8

accompanies the normal public offering has?

9

MR. DREEBEN:

No, Justice Stevens, they don't,

10

because the requirement that would attach under 12(2) is

11

not a requirement of affirmative disclosure.

12

requirement that's imposed by virtue of 12(2) is that the

The British Companies Act only

any secondary transactions, and it doesn't regulate

It doesn't regulate

And the point that I was trying to make about

the comparison between the language is that the British

Compani.es Act quite deliberately included the word,

20

prospective circular, et cetera, and then said, in

21

offering of securities to the public, and the Securities

22

Act drafters dropped that language and substituted in the

23

words, which offers any security for sale, which really

24

expresses a quite different and deliberately broader

25

connotation.

And when picked up in 12(2), I think as Justice

1

Ginsburg indicated, you can have offering circulars that

plain language of the statute quite clearly applies to

Not in the sense of Chevron,

We're not asking for deference in that

10

sense, but we do think that it is extraordinarily

revealing and very important to the construction of 12(2)

12

that at the time that this statute was passed, the

13

administrators who were responsible for its

14

implementation, which was the Federal Trade Commission,

15

issued releases that quite clearly said that the act in

Commission there were also a raft of articles that were

2

written at the time, or around the time, by such people as

William 0. Douglas and Felix Frankfurter -- Felix

4

Frankfurter was at the time very heavily involved in the

5

drafting process -- and those articles asserted without

6

qualification that section 12(2) applied to any sale of

security and wanted to educate the investment community

8

that was concerned with this that that was true.

9

This understanding continued not only

10

immediately after the '33 act was passed but for decades,

11

until the late 1980's.

12

There was very significant work trying to revise

13

the act in 1940, in which the industry and the Commission

14

together met, and everybody understood and expressed in

15

written documents that section 12(2) applies to a really

broad range of transactions, it doesn't distinguish among

the various types, it doesn't distinguish broker

transactions from initial public offerings, and it should,

do you account for the fact there have been so very few

cases like this?

MR. DREEBEN:

I -- the -- probably the

was the existence of Rule

litigation under

Yes.

But I take it you could get out of

that if in fact you enclosed as well a prospectus that had

met the SEC's registration requirement because of the

exception in (a).

Is that right, or not?

MR. DREEBEN:

That question has not been

definitively decided in the courts.

view of commentators is that the exceptions that are

There are several reasons for that, and there is

a statutory argument that supports it.

is that there is an unequivocal statement in the House

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD W. JENKINS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. JENKINS:

The fundamental issue here is

10

whether, when everybody says the '33 act was following the

11

British act, which only applied to public offerings, did

12

Congress somehow in the process, by section 12(2), totally

13

convert the '33 act to apply to all private communications

14

in all privately negotiated contexts?

15

The references by the draftsmen, by the House

16

report, and others that were involved in the process, not

17

later commentary in magazines, demonstrate irrefutably

18

that the overall scope of the act, and its civil liability

19

provisions in particular, didn't expand so drastically

20

from the British Companies Act.

act.

1

I think, if you believe what Mr. Landis wrote, which may

2

be a stretch, I don't know, but it appears accurate that

3

Mr. Frankfurter was overseeing it but was not as heavily

4

drafted.

5

In fact, I think Mr. Landis in his article

6

referred to Mr. Frankfurter seeing the draft of the act

7

for the first time before a meeting, or something along

8

those lines.

9

Mr. Landis, who said public offerings not private

13

The act was

-- the British act which did include

an express limitation to public offerings?

14

MR. JENKINS:

I think the simple answer is, they

15

felt it wasn't necessary.

16

ten sections of the act, and in particular section 5, the

17

heart of the act, is directed solely at one context,

You rely on using the same litany of

that extent.

1

which is in the British Companies Act, but Congress

2

repeatedly said, the draftsmen said, this act is the

3

British securities act.

4

How could those statements be correctly made if

5

one applies only to public distributions and the other is

6

much, much broader, applying to every private transaction

7

that ever involves the sale of a security and an

8

interstate communication?

9

The lack of any explanation, specific discussion

10

or anything, anywhere in the legislative history or the

11

House report of any notation that the act extended so much

12

more broadly is to our mind very, very strong proof that

13

Congress, none of the Congressmen, none of the drafters

14

intended such a broad departure from the public offering

15

context.

16

They just simply couldn't have said the things

17

they said in the reports about the act or in Mr. Landis'

18

article about the act if that were the case, if the act

19

intended to go into such a wide range of private,

20

negotiated transactions.
