ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM PERRY PENDLEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. PENDLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Adarand is a small, family-owned corporation

13

that does business in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

14

owned by and operated by Randy Pech, his wife Valerie, his

15

mom Ruth, and their friend and Partner, Steve Gaglan.

16

It is

In the year surrounding the events that led to

17

this action, Adarand's annual average gross receipts were

18

approximately $900,000, but their average annual net

19

profits was but $30,000.

20

event, they had a net negative cash flow of some $20,000.

21

In fact, in the year before this

Adarand specializes in the construction of

22

highway guardrails, primarily as a result of the receipt

23

of subcontracts from prime contractors.

24

submitted a bid to do the guardrail work on the

25

subcontract as a subcontractor along 4.7 miles of highway

In 1989, Adarand

1

in the San Juan National Forest in extreme Southwestern

2

Colorado.

3

Although it submitted the lowest bid, and

4

although it has an excellent reputation for doing quality-

5

work on a timely basis its bid was rejected by operation

6

of the statute questioned here, a statute which presumes

7

that all members of certain enumerated racial and ethnic

8

groups are socially and economically disadvantaged.
Adarand challenged the constitutionality of the

9
10

statute both on its face and as applied to him in the loss

11

of this $20,000 contract.
QUESTION:

12

13

Do we know that that was the reason

for the rejection?

14

MR. PENDLEY:

Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

When

15

we look at the statement by Mountain Sand and Gravel at

16

page 30 and 31 of the joint appendix, Mountain Sand and

17

Gravel says, but for the SCC, the subcontractor

18

compensation clause, Adarand would have received the

19

contract.

20
21

22

But -QUESTION:

Does that clarify that it was the

presumption that was crucial in this case?
MR. PENDLEY:

No.

That is clear by other means,

23

Justice Souter.

24

Randy Pech testified that in fact it was the operation of

25

the presumption.

There are several means:

1)

He said, Gonzales is a DBE because he is

a minority.
In addition, we have the testimony that's

2

3

contained in the appendix in the reply, at pages 7, 9 and

4

10, and 14, where three Government officials testified

5

they knew of no circumstance under which anybody had been

6

a DBE for any other reason than the operation of the

7

presumption.
QUESTION:

8

9

Did the judge take that -- make that

a finding that that was an undisputed material fact?
MR. PENDLEY:

10

There -- Justice Souter, there

11

were no genuine issues of material fact remaining in the

12

dispute.

14

for summary judgment stipulated to all the facts, or

agreed there were no genuine issues of material fact

remaining in dispute.

QUESTION:

One of those issues would have been

But you said the statute, and there

19

are several statutes under which one can be certified.

20

Can you tell us which of the statutes you are challenging

21

in this proceeding?

22

MR. PENDLEY:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

We're

23

challenging the -- several statutes.

25

Government's brief.

2

In addition, that -- there is section 637(d),

3

which is on page 11 of the Government's appendix, which

4

sets out the presumption, and that presumption is applied

5

to 644(g) because of the appropriation in the STURAA,

6

what's called the STURAA, the Surface Transportation and

7

Uniform Relocation Assistance Act, which is at page 16-A

8

of the Government's brief.

9

QUESTION:

But you're not challenging what has

10

been called the 8(a) certification, or are you -- does

11

that enter into this case?

12

MR. PENDLEY:

No, Justice Ginsburg, it does not,

13

simply the presumption under this Federal highway set-

14

aside, which is a direct funding program.

15

QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Pendley, the plaintiff

16

is not suing for the - - for damages or any backward­

17

looking relief for this particular contract, as I

18

understand it.

MR. PENDLEY:

We -- no, Justice O'Connor.

believe that we could go back and seek relief.
QUESTION:

We

We - -

Well, but that was not sought, and is

not sought in this suit?
MR. PENDLEY:

We seek such other -- such other

24

relief as may be just and equitable under the premises,

25

and that's on page 24.

2

QUESTION:

I thought you were seeking an

injunction and forward-looking relief.

3

MR. PENDLEY:

4

QUESTION:

We are seeking both, Your Honor.

The Solicitor General takes the

5

position that the petitioner lacks standing for a failure

6

to show that the presumption was applied here, or if it

7

was, that it was applied incorrectly.

8

9

MR. PENDLEY:

Well, Justice O'Connor, we believe

that there is plenty of evidence below to demonstrate that

10

it was in fact a presumption.

11

testimony, we have three Federal officials who were

12

running that particular agency, the Central Federal Lands

13

Highway Division, who testified that they know of no other

14

basis that anyone in Colorado was certified as a DBE,

15

except for the presumption.

16

We have Mr. Pech's

And one of the reasons why that's very

17

important, Justice O'Connor, is because section 108, the

18

subcontracting compensation clause, requires the prime

19

contractor to provide to the Federal Government a copy of

20

the DBE certification, so the Federal officials involved

21

in this program have known from the very beginning the

22

basis upon which the certification took place, which adds

23

increased importance to their testimony that they knew of

24

no situation in which DBE's were certified by any other

25

way than the presumption.

QUESTION:

1

And what did the petitioner show

2

would be his future damages, or the injury to be suffered

3

in the future?
MR. PENDLEY:

4

His injury, Justice O'Connor, is

5

the fact that he cannot compete on an equal footing, as

6

this Court held in the Jacksonville case, that that is the

7

harm, that is the harm, direct harm - QUESTION:

backward-looking relief being sought?
MR. PENDLEY:

10
11

12

Well, in Jacksonville, was there some

I don't believe so, Justice

O'Connor.
But what Mr. Pech has testified is, he bids on

13

every single contract in Colorado.

14

contract in Colorado, he bids on those projects, and as

15

long as there is a subcontractor compensation clause in

16

the provision that prevents him from competing on an equal

17

footing, he will be unable to compete.

Every single guardrail

18

In fact, he presented evidence in response to

19

the Government's interrogatory number 22 that showed he

20

had lost some 12 contracts already as a result of the

21

application of the socially and economically

22

disadvantaged - -

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Had he issued about 83 bids over a

period of some 9 years?
MR. PENDLEY:

Was that the testimony?
Yes, Your Honor, Justice Kennedy.

1

The testimony from the Government in response to one of

2

our interrogatories was there were some 87 contracts let

3

that contained guardrail work.

4

Of those, 64 were given to subcontractors to do,

5

and of that, 43 percent of that number went to DBE's, and

6

that's consistent with the documents provided by the L. S.

7

Lee amicus brief, where they point to the General

8

Accounting Office report that shows that in many of these

9

States -- for example in Colorado, 78 percent of the

10

traffic signaling is going to DBE's.

11

90 percent of the guardrails and fencing is going to

12

DBE's.

QUESTION:

In Connecticut,

there were subcontractors, had your client bid on all of

QUESTION:

Do you contend that Congress failed

to make adequate findings concerning racial discrimination

Yes, Your Honor.

We think there's

MR. PENDLEY:

Yes.

Well, I'm trying to answer

12

that, Justice -- excuse me.

13

and the answer is that it was a facial challenge, and so

14

Justice -- Chief Justice Burger insisted that he had --

15

the Court had reasonable assurances that the

16

administrative process would be operating effectively and

17

properly, it would be narrowly limited, it would be

18

limited to the situations in which it applied, in fact, as

19

amicus Pacific Legal Foundation points out in footnote 44,

20

it was very clear -- 44 of the Fullilove brief, opinion --

21

it was very clear that it was only going to apply to

22

minorities who were disadvantaged.

23

QUESTION:

I hope this is the answer,

Well, that goes to the tailoring.

I

24

don't think that goes to whether there were adequate

1

the congressional findings of discrimination in the

2

construction industry.

3

MR. PENDLEY:

Your Honor, I don't think there's

4

adequate findings here.

I think what one has to look

5

at - - the Court should look at is the appendix B of the

6

Government's brief, where they set -- where it sets out

7

what they think is the best -- its best shot at

8

demonstrating the findings.
And one looks at pages 21 and 23, for example,

9
10

and we hear again the litany of problems that small

11

businesses like Adarand face, problems getting bonding,

12

problems getting certification, problems dealing with

13

Government paperwork, problems getting paid by prime on

14

time, these are problems that cut, as the Court has said

15

in the past, not across racial lines but across business

16

on size lines.

17

makes findings like that, they are so amorphous as to be

18

limitless.

19

That's really the issue.

When Congress

In addition, the Government points to two

20

specific things:

21

York, and 2) problems with State officials in Illinois.

22

1) problems with trade unions in New

Now, it seems that those cry out for race-

23

neutral resolution, that those are issues that can be

dealt with on a case-specific basis to end whatever

2

officials who are violating the law.
QUESTION:

Suppose the Government interest here

3

were to remedy the past effects of racial discrimination.

4

Could the Government pass a statute to accomplish its

5

interest without using race-conscious measures?

6

MR. PENDLEY:

Oh, I think that's the

7

aspirational goal, Justice Kennedy, that the Congress be

8

victim-specific.

9

that spreads out there, we have a victim-specific remedy,

I think when you look at the continuum

10

and at the other end we have a total indifference to the

11

nature of the victims, if they are, and whether or not

12

they've suffered.

13

indifference.

14

That's what we have here, total

I mean, we have a situation here where a Hong

15

Kong banker, a Japanese electrical engineer, or the son of

16

landed gentry from Spain could come to Colorado Springs,

17

buy 51 percent of Adarand, and turn it into a DBE.

18

QUESTION:

I don't see how it could do that,

19

because I thought that the claim had to be one of specific

20

injury to this particular subcontractor, by virtue of

21

membership in some group.

22

MR. PENDLEY:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

That's the Government's --

I guess, to make it clear, I thought

group membership was necessary, but it was not sufficient.
MR. PENDLEY:

Your Honor, it is sufficient.

QUESTION:

Well, let's start with the statute.

8

Under the statute, would it be sufficient simply to be a

9

member of a group?

10

MR. PENDLEY:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

The regulations read as though the

12

SBA will issue a certification only if the business shows

13

it meets the definition of economic disadvantage, and does

14

that mean that each participant has to personally

15

demonstrate harm from discrimination to qualify?

16

MR. PENDLEY:

O'Connor, the certification was by the States, and --

current situation, which is totally indifferent to any --

any injustice, or - -

3

QUESTION:

I thought the regulations could be

4

read to require just that and I wondered, if they did,

5

what your view of them might be?

6

MR. PENDLEY:

I don't think the regulations can

7

be read that way.

8

there's -- in the notice of proposed rulemaking that we

9

discuss on page 22 of -- I believe it's page 22 of our

In fact, they specifically say,

10

brief, where the Government says -- talking about the

11

proposed rulemaking coming out on certification, and it

12

says, we've had inquiries from States saying, what do we

13

do, do we inquire into the economic status of these

14

organizations?

15

And the answer is, States, you don't do that.

16

Once you have determined that this applicant is a member

17

of one of the identified racial groups, the inquiry ends.

18

That individual, that organization is certified.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Pendley, isn't it accurate to say

20

that actual, personal harm from discrimination is

21

necessary, but it is presumed?

scheme of the statute that technically it is necessary,

23

but it is simply presumed to exist if the enterprise is a

QUESTION:

1

Now, the Government says that that's

2

good enough.

If you have a problem with the presumption,

3

you could have come in and showed that in your case, in

4

the case of this contract, the presumption was not valid.

5

Did you have such an opportunity?
MR. PENDLEY:

6

The rules permit a third party to

7

challenge the presumption, but as Pacific Legal Foundation

8

points out in their amicus brief, that's not consistent

9

with the real world.
I think the first question is, is it fair, is it

10
11

right to ensure the equal protection guarantees be put on

12

the back of an Adarand, rather than on the Government,

13

which is dispensing these benefits, and the benefited

14

party?

15

In addition, the difficulty an Adarand has,

16

first of all, Judge Posner --as the amicus Association of

17

General Contractors' brief points out, discussing Judge

18

Posner's point that what if we had a rebuttable

19

presumption that blacks could not do highway construction

20

work?

21

even if it was rebuttable.

22

That would be odious and offensive on its face,

The irony here, in comparison is in that

23

situation, the black contractor is in possession of the

24

knowledge necessary to rebut the presumption.

25

But Fullilove involved a straight-

Yes.

On the facial challenge, to agree

with you, mustn't we overrule Fullilove?

No, Your Honor.

How can you take both statutes on

set-aside is good, and the other, that has a rebuttable

presumption, that has a concept of economic disadvantage,

that is not race-specific, that that one is no good?

MR. PENDLEY:

In the Fullilove case, Justice --

21

Chief Justice Burger's opinion is filled with references

22

to the flexibility of the program, the waivers in the

23

program, how they can get out from under it, the ceilings

of the program, how they could not give to DBE's in

improper situations, so it was a very flexible program.

you give this contract to one of our DBE's instead of the

QUESTION:

Congress described that not as a

to be a cost compensation, recognizing that it would be an

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DREW S. DAYS, III
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
GENERAL DAYS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The subcontracting compensation clause

14

challenged here is a means of effectuating a national

15

policy designed by Congress and supported by Presidents of

16

both parties to ensure to the greatest extent possible

17

that Federal procurement programs do not compound the

18

continuing effects of well-documented discrimination but,

19

rather, serve to offset their consequences.

20

The process by which compensation is awarded is

21

neither overinclusive, since members of certain designated

22

racial and ethnic groups were not, in fact, disadvantaged

23

or ineligible under the program, nor underinclusive, since

24

some individuals who are not members of those designated

25

groups may qualify as socially and disadvantaged persons

under the regulatory scheme.
QUESTION:

2

General Days, why couldn't Congress

3

have done this without a presumption, and just said that

4

if the DBE can show factual economic disadvantage, it gets

5

the benefit, but not use any presumption?
GENERAL DAYS:

6

Mr. Chief Justice, Congress could

7

have done that, but I think what the record reflects here

8

is a review by Congress over a number of years, looking at
the degree to which Federal contracting dollars were going

10

to contractors who had participated in some way or

11

reinforced discrimination against members of certain

12

racially and economically disadvantaged groups and decided

13

that this was the appropriate way to do it.

14

QUESTION:

So it's really a matter of

15

administrative convenience?

16

out this way in the majority of cases?

17

GENERAL DAYS:

They figured it would come

Well, I wouldn't characterize it

18

as administrative convenience.

determination that if the results that Congress wanted to

20

have occur were to occur, they would have to be done in

21

this way.

22

It was simply a

Congress -QUESTION:

And Congress, then, was indifferent

23

to the fact that perhaps people who had not been in fact

24

economically disadvantaged might, because of the

25

presumption, nonetheless get the benefit of it?

1

GENERAL DAYS:

Congress was, I think, concerned

2

about that, but was aware that the administrative scheme

3

that was in place or set up after the statute was amended

4

would deal with those particular problems.

5

One has to understand that the Small Business

6

Act, for example, was in existence for 25 years before

7

Congress decided to focus, as it has in recent years, on

8

the problems of members of certain racial and ethnic

9

groups that were socially and economically disadvantaged,

10

so there was some experience on the part of Congress with

11

the way in which Federal procurement dollars were somehow

12

not finding their way to people who were the victims of

13

discrimination.

14

QUESTION:

General Days, as a practical matter,

15

how does a third party go about challenging the economic

16

disadvantage presumption as applied to a particular

17

contractor?

18

GENERAL DAYS:

What a contractor, a

19

subcontractor would do in a situation like this in

20

Adarand's case is bring to the attention of the

21

contracting officer or, if it were appropriate, to the

22

SBA, the fact that it felt that a company that claimed to

23

be a disadvantaged business enterprise was not a

24

disadvantaged business enterprise.

25

example, the amount of contracts, the number of contracts

2

that that particular company had won.
QUESTION:

How does he know that the company is

3

claiming that status?

4

that he would know whose claim to challenge?

5

Is it posted somewhere publicly

GENERAL DAYS:

Yes.

Under the STURAA scheme

6

disadvantaged business enterprises are listed by the

7

States so that they can participate in programs that the

8

State enters into with the Federal Government, so it is

9

possible for one to look down that list and identify those

10

who are claiming to be disadvantaged business enterprises.

11

QUESTION:

But how would you know which one?

12

mean, you have a particular bid situation.

13

going out for bid.

14

GENERAL DAYS:

15

QUESTION:

I

There is a job

Yes.

And how does someone like petitioner

16

know that from that long list a particular one is going to

17

be trying to get the certification and therefore that's

18

the one that should be challenged?

19

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, it can be done at the time

20

that that subcontractor comes forward.

For example, in

21

this subcontracting compensation clause situation, in the

22

Adarand situation, once Mountain Gravel decided that it

23

was going to participate in the SCC program and was

24

seeking out disadvantaged business enterprises and

1

needs, at that point --

2

QUESTION:

3

Gonzales had been identified?

4

How would the petitioner know that

GENERAL DAYS:

One of the ways that Adarand

5

would know, in fact, is that Gonzales has been involved in

6

a number of contracts, and they're generally aware --

7

QUESTION:

But there's no mechanism to let the

8

petitioner know in a particular situation that this is the

9

one to focus on?

10

GENERAL DAYS:

I think that once the subcontract

11

is let to Gonzales, Adarand can come in and say Gonzales

12

does not qualify appropriately as a DBE.

13
14
15
16

QUESTION:

That makes it much harder to upset, I

suppose, after the fact.
Are you aware of any instances where third
parties have successfully challenged --

17

GENERAL DAYS:

18

QUESTION:

GENERAL DAYS:

Yes.

-- one of these certifications?
Yes, I am.

We have cited in our

20

brief, for example, a challenge that came through the SBA

21

process in the Autek case, where a Native American firm

22

had claimed social and economic disadvantaged status, and

23

it was determined that because of the income of that

24

particular company, it should not be permitted that status

25

as a disadvantaged business enterprise.

3

QUESTION:

You can answer that yes or no,

General Days.
GENERAL DAYS:

No, I don't think that we have

4

precisely pinned down, but the point is that the SBA and

5

the State contracting agencies get information from a

6

number of sources, and they are open to claims from any

7

source, and then investigate those particular situations.

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, Adarand says that as a

practical matter that's a fantasy, that there's not enough

10

time, there's not enough information, and besides which

11

you blackball yourself by identifying yourself as a

12

litigious individual.

13

No general contractor wants to hire somebody

14

who's going to promote litigation, and if - - now, is that

true or false?

fact that this presumption is really only that, and that

it's a real, live, working system in which it's challenged

19

with some regularity, it seems to me to be in effect a

20

conclusive presumption.

21

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, it is not, Justice Scalia.

22

I'd like to point the Court to an amicus brief by the

QUESTION:

But under the act, at least it's

theoretically possible to challenge the determination that

this person has not in fact been subject to racial

discrimination?

15

GENERAL DAYS:

I think, Justice Kennedy, it's

16

not correct to say that there can be a challenge to

17

someone who says, I am an African American, that they in

18

fact are not African American.

19

The real focus of this program is on

20

disadvantage, and so the inquiry naturally focuses on

21

whatever the problems this particular organization has

22

had, if it's overcome those disadvantages and is competing

23

as would any other agency or company, then it is not

24

eligible for participation in the disadvantaged business

enterprise program.

QUESTION:

It is challenging not the

General Days, I believe Mr. Pendley

8

said he's not challenging the 8(a) certification program,

9

and it does seem that there's a big difference when you

10

get to economic disadvantage, that it's not automatic

11

under 8(a).

Am I right in that --

12

GENERAL DAYS:

13

QUESTION:

that's correct.

-- that there's a presumption under

14

8(d) that if nobody challenges it just sticks based on

15

minority status, but that's not so for 8(a) certification?

16

GENERAL DAYS:

That's correct.

In fact, Justice

17

Ginsburg, although it appears that under 8(a) one can

18

challenge economic -- that there's a presumption of social

19

disadvantage but not of equal economic disadvantage, and

20

that under the 8(d) program there's a presumption with

21

respect to both.

22

The fact is that the analysis under both regimes

23

is that there can be an open challenge to the nature of

24

the particular company as to whether it's economically

25

disadvantaged, so the regimes and the challenges and the

particular company is economically disadvantaged, although

it might satisfy the social disadvantage prong of the

QUESTION:

General Days, what is the limit of --

6

if there is any, of the Government's ability to use race

7

as a -- as the basis for a presumption in some of its

8

programs?

9

Suppose the Government has a very important

10

space program which just can't afford any mistakes, and it

11

says, just looking over education statistics, whites

12

generally have a higher level of education, and we are

13

going to assume that any bidder that is white-owned is a

14

more competent bidder -- it's just a presumption.

to use that presumption for the program.

want to come in and show that even though you're not

GENERAL DAYS:

1

Justice Scalia, I think that the

2

difference between this situation and the situation that

3

you posed is a question of whether Congress is acting for

4

remedial purposes, and what we have here is - -

5
6

QUESTION:

I don't know what that means.

It's a

good, valid governmental purpose in both cases.

7

GENERAL DAYS:

No, but what I'm talking about is

8

Congress either explicitly or by way of the operation of a

9

statutory scheme is attempting to remedy the effects of

10

prior racial discrimination, relying upon its authority

11

under section 5 of the Fourteenth, or other provisions of

12

the Civil War Amendment.

13

QUESTION:

Well, but how can section 5 of the

14

Fourteenth Amendment give Congress authority to lessen the

15

effect of that amendment on congressional actions?

16

There's -- I think there's a statement in the Katzenbach

17

case that Congress can move in only one direction under

18

the Fourteenth Amendment.

19

GENERAL DAYS:

It could make the standards more

Yes.

QUESTION:

-- less stringent?

Yes, that the equal protection

4

component, let's say, of the Fifteenth -- of the Fifth

5

Amendment would be less demanding on Congress.

6

GENERAL DAYS:

I think what this Court has

7

indicated in a number of decisions is that Congress

8

possesses a unique and comprehensive power to legislate

9

under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, or section 2

10

of the Thirteenth, or of the Fifteenth Amendment, to

11

remedy the effects of racial discrimination, or denial of

12

equal protection, but particularly where racial

13

discrimination is concerned, and the example that Justice

14

Scalia gave indicates nothing about the desire of Congress

15

to deal with discrimination and to remedy it.

16

QUESTION:

It can do that, but can it do it by

17

adopting race-based presumptions?

question that it can do it --

1

The 10 percent.

If one

2

subcontracts above 10 percent, then one can get the

3

benefit of the SCC, but it's not an open-ended program.

4

In other words, the prime contractor cannot continue to

5

gain more and more money by taking on more DBE

6

subcontractors in that particular contract, because the

7

compensation is limited to 1.5 percent of the overall

8

contract, or 2 percent, if there are more than -- two or
more subcontractors, but there's not an infinite ability

10

of a prime contractor to just add on DBE's in order to

11

gain compensation.
QUESTION:

12

13

Is he more favored if he adds on more

DBE's?

14

GENERAL DAYS:

No, he is not.

There's no

15

indication that a prime contractor, Mountain Gravel in

16

this case, would have lost a contract because it didn't

17

take advantage of the SCC.

18

therefore Mountain Gravel could have decided not to use

the SCC at all, and would have kept the prime contract and

would have carried it out in ways other than under the DBE

program.

in fact couldn't bring such a lawsuit because it

someone in the position of Adarand have a right to sue the

QUESTION:

Isn't it

No, that would not be possible.

So the only thing that someone in

Adarand's position could do is to say, procurement

You look into it.

That's right, and to challenge

the extent to which the contracting officer had not, in

Do you want to add anything about the

With regard to the presumption, the reason the

6

7

presumption wasn't opposed, Mr. Justice Scalia, is because

8

from the beginning, from the get-go and the origin in this

9

case, the Government knew the presumption worked, and that

10

was the assumption all the way through --

MR. PENDLEY:

Mr. Pendley --- this process.

Excuse me, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

-- may I ask you a question about the

15

presumption, which is quite an important part of the case?

16

Would you legal argument be different if, instead of a

17

presumption, the statute said that the person seeking a

18

DBA certification could put in evidence of discrimination

19

against other members of that person's race to attempt to

20

make the showing, and that the trial -- that the fact­

21

finder would be entitled to rely on such evidence?

22

that be a different case?

MR. PENDLEY:

Would

I think that would be an

absolutely different case.
QUESTION:

Would that be permissible, in your

view?
MR. PENDLEY:

To the extent that Congress set up

3

some fact-finding that was necessary, some level that was

4

necessary, some hurdle that had some meaning that there

5

was -- so one could see if there was a tight fit between

6

the discrimination and the remedy.

7

QUESTION:

The tight fit would be that an Afro-

8

American would prove that a lot of other Afro-Americans

9

had been discriminated against, but this one never

10

suffered any discrimination.

No, I -- that --

Would that be a permissible showing?
I don't think so.

You don't?
No.

So it really isn't -I think it has to be -- excuse me,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

It's not the presumption that is

20

critical but, rather, the relevance of the discrimination

21

against other members of the race?

Exactly, Your Honor.

General is correct, others may qualify for this program,

subpart D, appendix A, where they list the Vietnam

veteran, the Appalachian white, the ascetic Jews, but said

it must be emphasized that these individuals are not

No, Your Honor.

I draw the Court's attention

to page 23 of our brief, footnote 20.

In making the

certification decision, the recipient, that's the State,

11

relies on this presumption and does not investigate the

12

social and economic status of individuals who fall into

13

one of the presumptive groups.

QUESTION:

In the State of Colorado's presump -

15

certification, is that permanent, or is that subject to

periodic review, when the State certifies?

First of all, when an Adarand

The first thing that happens is

the contracting officer stops the contract, and he

Number 2, the DBE presumption continues in

place, so this DBE continues to be able to bid on other

projects until the process is over, and frankly, when one

8

examines the amorphous basis upon which one is socially

regulations, it's hard to imagine how an Adarand could

defeat the presumption.
