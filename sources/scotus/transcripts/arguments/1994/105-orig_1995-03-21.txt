ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF KANSAS
MR. DRAPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The State of Kansas is here this morning in

Kansas depends on those return flows and on the

benefits of John Martin Reservoir, which was conducted in

the 1940's about 60 miles above the State line,

MR. DRAPER:

Over what period of time is that?
This is over the study period of

1950 through 1985, Mr. Chief Justice.

the Colorado winter water storage program.

seen that comparison before.

The State of Kansas has filed three

exceptions.

Mr. Draper, the special master concluded, as I understand

1

his report and recommendation, that Kansas just failed to

2

demonstrate adequately those depletions, and if that

3

factual finding is valid, why doesn't that end the matter

4

on those claims?
MR. DRAPER:

5

Your Honor, the two claims are

6

quite different with respect to the answer to your

7

question.

8

he did dismiss the Kansas case at the end of its evidence

9

for failure of proof, but the reason was that he believed

10

With respect to the Trinidad Reservoir claim,

as a matter of law that Kansas had proved the wrong thing.
We proved that Colorado had violated the

11
12

operating principles adopted by the Arkansas River Compact

13

Administration for the operation of this reservoir.

14

believe that the adoption by the compact administration of

15

principles for the operations of the reservoir which were

16

proposed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation set

17

the standard for compliance with respect to that project

18

under the compact.

19

QUESTION:

We

Well, presumably the parties to that

20

special operating program can sue in district court to

21

enforce any rights under that separate agreement, isn't

22

that so?

23

MR. DRAPER:

We don't believe that's true, Your

24

Honor.

25

the only meaningful forum, in which we can press a claim

We believe that this is the only forum, certainly

1

for violation of the operating principles.

2

QUESTION:

But the master found that there was

3

no damage in effect to Kansas because there was no proof

4

that the flow at State line was any different, isn't that

5

right?

6

MR. DRAPER:

We believe, Your Honor, that the

7

State of Kansas received some benefits from the adoption

8

of the operating principles that correspond to the

9

allowance of the project in the first place, which was

10

being held up until --

MR. DRAPER:

Well --- Kansas gave its approval.
-- could you answer my question?
The answer is that it is

sufficient, in our view, to prove -QUESTION:

Well, my question was, didn't the

7

master find that there was no appreciable change in volume

of flow at State line?

MR. DRAPER:

strongly, Your Honor.

was developed on a study period of

and not for the operation period that we're talking about

in this case, which is

operating principles was for that period.

There is no

QUESTION:

1

Well, then -- but then if the master

2

is right, and it's up to Kansas to show some depletion of

3

flow at the State line, Kansas still fails, it seems to

4

me, even if there's no showing one way or the other, if

5

the burden of proof is on Kansas, and this is Kansas'

6

lawsuit.

7

MR. DRAPER:

Your Honor, the evidence showed

8

that the departure from the operating principles, which we

9

believe is the compliance standard for this project, did

10

cause depletions of waters that otherwise would have gone

11

to Kansas.

The inflows to John Martin Reservoir -QUESTION:

12

Well, but now this is what the master

3

said, and I think I have the quote right:

4

attempt to establish that the flows of the Arkansas River

5

at the State line were less than they would have been if

6

the Trinidad project had not been constructed or operated

7

at all.

20

MR. DRAPER:

Kansas did not

That is technically correct, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And Article IV-D of the compact

21

allows developments such as Trinidad, subject only to the

22

proviso that they don't materially deplete usable flows at

23

the State line.

24
25

MR. DRAPER:

It does not mention the State line,

Your Honor, just flows available for use to Kansas users,

1

and during the study period, the inflows to John Martin

2

Reservoir were divided 40 percent and 60 percent between

3

the two States, and delivered to the State line with the

4

help of a trans-loss account to be sure that the flows

5

actually reached Kansas.
This was also the standard that the Bureau of

6

7

Reclamation used when it devised the operating principles

8

in 1964 and proposed those to the compacting States.
QUESTION:

9

Well, is it correct, however, that

10

you made no effort to show that in fact it reduced the

11

flow from what it would have been had there been no

12

project at all?

13

Is that an accurate enough statement?

MR. DRAPER:

That is an accurate statement, Your

14

Honor.

15

Kansas, usable flows to Kansas as a result of the

16

departure from the operating principles.

17

We show that there was a depletion of flows to

QUESTION:

And the master -- you're not

18

contesting that he said -- your theory ultimately was that

19

a violation of the separate operating principles per se

20

constituted a compact violation, and that was a theory

21

that he rejected.

22

MR. DRAPER:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
And what was wrong with his

24

observation that there were other remedies, assuming that

25

the operating principles were violated, that there were

1

remedies appropriate to that?
MR. DRAPER:

2

We don't believe that is correct,

3

Your Honor.

4

meaningful forum that we have, that the State of Kansas

5

has to enforce the operating principles.

6

an interstate dispute, and interstate disputes, whether

7

they're under a compact or not, must be brought in this

8

forum.

9

We believe that this forum is the only-

QUESTION:

It is basically

What is the -- what do you rely -- as

10

I understand it, though I didn't quite understand your

11

answer to Justice Scalia, that you say that they violated

12

the procedures, these procedures.

13

MR. DRAPER:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
All right, and then the issue -- and

15

if they violated the procedures, then they violated the

16

compact.

17

MR. DRAPER:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
But the other side says, you're

19

right, as long as there was a material depletion of the

20

water available to Kansas, and you think that's shown

21

automatically by the fact they violated the procedures,

22

and they don't.

So that's my understanding of it.

23

MR. DRAPER:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct, Your Honor.
All right.

Now, if that's correct,

then what is it that shows that automatically violating

1

these procedures would violate the compact, without some

2

further showing of what physically happened in terms of

3

availability of water to Kansas?

4

automatically?

5

What is it that shows it

The best think that I thought you pointed to is

6

this thing about a letter to the Governor of Kansas from

7

Mr. Dugan.

MR. DRAPER:

8

9

Is that the best thing for you?
Yes.

That is the letter that

immediately preceded the adoption of the operating

10

principles by the compact administration.

11

our brief at page A-85.
QUESTION:

12

It appears in

The problem I had with that letter,

13

which is what I'm getting to, is it says that if they

14

don't violate the -- if they don't violate the procedures,

15

they won't materially deplete the flow.

16

it says?

17

have is, the proposed project will not materially deplete

18

the water if it's operated under the guidelines.

19
20

If you don't violate the procedures -- what I

MR. DRAPER:

QUESTION:

22

MR. DRAPER:

24
25

That letter indicated that strict

compliance with the operating principles --

21

23

Isn't that what

Would not deplete --- would achieve compliance with

the compact.
QUESTION:

Right, but it doesn't say what will

happen if you don't comply with the procedures.

It leaves

1

it up in the air.

2

MR. DRAPER:

3

QUESTION:

Literally, that's true, Your Honor.
All right, so then if that's true,

4

then what is it that you have to prove that if you do

5

violate the procedures, that automatically depletes the

6

flow, or at least the parties thereby agreed to that, and

7

I couldn't find anything in here that said that they did

8

agree to that automatic -MR. DRAPER:

9

Your Honor, we believe that the

10

statement by the Bureau of Reclamation and the operating

11

principles themselves, the mandatory language that is

12

contained in those, in the preamble and in every operative

13

section of the operating principles, indicates that these

14

are intended to be binding in nature, and that they form

15

the standard of compact compliance for that particular

16

proj ect.

17
18

QUESTION:

Well, isn't Kansas' suit a suit for

violation of the compact?

19

MR. DRAPER:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct.
The SG takes the position that the

21

compact does not even empower the compact administrators

22

to amend the compact to create a new, enforceable right

23

under the compact.

24
25

MR. DRAPER:

Your Honor, Article VIII-B(2) of

the compact, which appears on page 3 of our blue brief,

accords the administration -- that's the compact

2

administration -- the power to prescribe procedures for

3

the administration of this compact, and by the proviso of

4

that provision, it makes very clear that those are

5

proceedings --

6

QUESTION:

Yes, but how does VIII-B authorize

7

the compact administrators to establish a compact

8

violation that differs from that set out in Article IV-D?

9

I mean, that's what the standard is.

10

suit was brought under.

11

Kansas didn't prove.

12

you want to go.

13

MR. DRAPER:

That's what your

That's what the master said

I just don't see how you get where

The answer, Your Honor, is that

14

the -- there is no difference between compliance with the

15

operating principles and the compact itself with respect

16

to this project.

17

It was studied by the U.S. Bureau of

18

Reclamation, it was determined what was necessary in order

19

to comply with the compact -- this is a reservoir,

20

incidentally, which is 220 miles above the State line, and

21

the compact administration was looking at the question,

22

how do we operate this project on a day-to-day basis?

23

we have the gates of the reservoir open today, or not, or

24

how long do we keep them open?

25

We have down, or in the compact itself the

3

operations, and that's what the compact administration was

4

adopting here, were the exact daily operations so that the

5

dam tender who is employed by the Federal Government will

6

know when the open the gates and when to close them at

7

this project.

8

10

What does that mean in terms of the daily-

QUESTION:

May I ask, are these violations of

the procedures ongoing, or have they been terminated?
MR. DRAPER:

They have been terminated for the

11

moment by a letter from the Colorado State engineer, the

12

highest water official for domestic water use in Colorado,

13

that until the violations were either determined, or the

14

practices which form the basis for the violations were

15

determined not to be a violation, or the principles were

16

amended, that the reservoir would be so --

17

QUESTION:

Well, has it not been determined that

18

there were violations, so doesn't that mean they will

19

cease in the future, then?

20

MR. DRAPER:

21

QUESTION:

I'm sorry?
There has been a determination, has

22

there not, that there were violations of the procedures,

23

and does it therefore not follow that they will be

24

discontinued in the future?

MR. DRAPER:

And also that they've been

They are terminated for the moment,

6

but that is only by letter of the Colorado State water

official, and that letter could be revoked.
QUESTION:

8

9

Mr. Draper, what has the practice of

the parties been under the agreement?

Has it, in fact,

10

been the Arkansas River Compact Administration that has

11

prescribed procedures for the administration of this

12

proj ect?

13
14
15

MR. DRAPER:

These are the only operating

procedures for this project, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And are they given authority to

16

prescribe those procedures by some document other than

17

this compact?

18

MR. DRAPER:

19

is the basis of that authority.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

The compact itself

The statute that sets up the project

does not authorize them to prescribe procedures?
MR. DRAPER:

The statute that sets up the

23

project requires that the project be operated in

24

compliance with the Arkansas River Compact.

That's all it says.

MR. DRAPER:

2

QUESTION:

That'S correct.
And in fact, it would seem the

3

parties have behaved as though Article VIII-A and VIII-B

4

does consider these procedures part of the compact.
MR. DRAPER:

5

Yes, we believe so.

Kansas agreed

6

to those procedures and required that they be adopted, and

gave its approval, which was essential for the funding to

Then go

I would first like to address some comments to

I wish to make

it clear that the master did not make a finding on the

of depletion when he was discussing how full the courtroom

to use Article IV-D to show a material depletion.

May I ask you a question about

MR. ROBBINS:

That's correct.

Yes.
It was a -- what they were

6

concerned about was, if you simply use the term,

7

depletion, Kansas and Colorado might be here every year

8

arguing about some small glitch, and you must remember

9

that this is a river that has average -- that has flow

10

conditions that on the average are a number of, you know,

11

600,000 or 800,000 acre feet, but rise into the millions

have this huge variability in the system, and they didn't

material depletion was intended to cover that.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I would like to address the issues in the order

8

that they are presented in our brief.

9

correctly resolved the Trinidad claim.

First, the master
Kansas has

10

predicated that claim on the theory that Trinidad

11

operations have breached the compact, but the only

12

relevant limitation that the compact imposes on new

13

projects like Trinidad is that they cannot materially

14

deplete usable flows.
Kansas has made no showing that Trinidad has had

15
16

that effect.

Instead, Kansas has attempted to show that

17

Colorado has allowed a local irrigation district to

18

violate reservoir operating principles, but those

19

operating principles are not a part of the compact, and

20

hence their violation cannot establish a violation of the

21

compact.

22

Simply put, Kansas cannot predicate its compact

23

action based on conduct that the compact does not forbid.

The master also correctly concluded that Kansas
had failed to prove its winter water storage claim.

The

he concluded that Kansas had failed to show that the

winter water storage program had caused material State

line depletions.

The record fully supports that

arguing that Colorado should bear the burden of disproving

QUESTION:

MR. MINEAR:

-- of the compact violation?
It is our view that it would make

3

sense to employ the clear and convincing standard in this

4

situation.

5

The reason we reach that conclusion is because

6

this Court has recognized that the clear and convincing

7

standard applies in actions between the States in other

8

interstate disputes, most frequently in actual

9

apportionment measures, and the factors that lead to the

10

application of the clear and convincing standard, namely

11

the sensitive nature of litigation between States, and

12

also the disruptive effect of disturbing settled water

13

uses, both call for a clear and convincing standard to

14

make sure that there is not a mistake.

15

QUESTION:

Although we have suggested that a

16

preponderance standard is appropriate for violations of a

17

decree, is it?

18

MR. MINEAR:

I think that the Court -- this -- I

19

think you're speaking to the 1993 decision in Nebraska v.

20

Wyoming, and in that case the Court noted that a party

21

does not need to prove injury in order to enforce a

22

decree.

the decree itself, but the Court did not speak to the

24

question of the burden of proof, or the standard of proof

25

in that situation.

the standard of proof would be clear and convincing even

Court looked at was the disruptive effect of disrupting

QUESTION:

Yes, but the disruption theoretically

has occurred by the decree.

The only question is the

does not implicate the same sort of disruption in settled

The assumption is a different one, that the usage

10

Well, I respectfully disagree with

that, because the problem here is really one of the

12

question of the level of confidence you have with respect

to the factual findings that are made, and this case

14

nicely illustrates that.

15

The Kansas model here had numerous serious

problems.

QUESTION:

No, I -- you're that there is certain

evidence which does not carry with it a high probative

7

You're saying, this isn't good enough to get you across

the line for preponderance.

QUESTION:

Just because you have an overall

claim, I believe that there is some confusion here as to

8

the appropriate question that the Court needs to address,

9

and that is, while there may be dispute about the

10

quantification of the depletions of usable flow caused by

11

the Colorado winter water storage program, we would assert

12

for your review that there is no meaningful dispute with

13

regard to the existence of depletions.

it still found depletions.
