ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

Since 1920, the Interstate Commerce Act has

12

prohibited common carriers from delivering freight on

13

credit except pursuant to regulations adopted by the

14

Interstate Commerce Commission governing credit

15

transactions, and that prohibition was extended to motor

16

carriers when they came under the ICC's jurisdiction in

17

the Motor Carrier Act of 1935.

18

focused on railroads, of course.

19

Prior thereto, it was

The ICC first adopted credit regulations in 1920

20

and from 1920 until 1988 those regulations contained no

21

authorization of liquidated damages for late payment of

22

freight charges.

23

collect the prescribed rate for a timely payment plus

24

interest for the delay.

25

The only authorized remedy was to

1

the first time, at the behest of the American Trucking

2

Association and other carrier interests, authorized

3

liquidated damages for collection expense charges in the

4

regulations, and those are set forth beginning at page 83a

5

of the appendix to our petition, subpart g of the

6

regulations, entitled "Collection Expense Charges."

7

In an amicus brief filed in our support by the

8

Health & Personal Care Distribution Conference and some

9

other shipping associations, on page 4 and 5, the course

10

of the rulemaking proceedings is recounted and the

11

citations are given.

12

The shipping interests were, of course,

13

participants and quite concerned about unfairness to them

14

that may eventuate and, because of that, the ICC included

15

initially in the 1988 regulations and added in the revised

16

regulations in 1989 certain conditions for the collection

17

of these liquidated damages which, it is undisputed, were

18

not complied with in this case.

19

Those include from, beginning with the provision

20

that was in the original 1988 regulations and was

21

retained, a requirement that the original bills advise

22

shippers of the consequence of late payment.

23

forth on page 86a.

24
25

That is set

It's subpart (c).

And the two provisions that were added in 1989
to further protect shippers from the unfair practices are

set forth first on page 85a, and that is subpart

2

(g)(2)(vi), that revised bills have to be issued within a

3

90-day period after the original credit period had

4

expired.

That also admittedly was not complied with.

5

And then on page 84, subpart (iii) of (g)(2), it

6

says that the loss of discount, or the liquidated damages,

7

cannot be applied on an aggregated basis but can only be

8

applied on separate and independent freight bills.

9

are obviously great economies of scale in aggregate

There

10

collections, and there was concern that aggregate

11

collections would be made, particularly after carriers

12

became insolvent, and there's a specific reference in that

13

provision to a bankruptcy trustee attempting to collect on

14

an aggregate basis.

15

So what we are concerned with here is an effort

16

that was made by respondent, as the trustee for this

17

insolvent carrier, to bill shippers from several years

18

earlier and collect additional payments, including these

19

very heavy liquidated damage charges, an effort that was

20

specifically foreseen by the Commission in adopting the

21

regulations authorizing credit transactions, and --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, could you clarify for me

23

what this -- what you've been calling the liquidated

24

damages which the respondents call the bureau rate, when,

25

1

failure to pay on time, would this bureau rate apply, and

2

in connection with that, what rate would apply to someone

3

who is shipping these same goods on these same routes who

4

pays on delivery, who doesn't get credit terms?

5

wouldn't be the bureau rate, would it?

6

some --

7

MR. WALLACE:

That

It would be

That is correct.

It would be the

8

same discount rate that applies to the credit

9

transactions, plus there can be a service charge for the

10

delayed payment in the -QUESTION:

11

But wouldn't -- I'm positing no delay

in payment.

13

favorable than the discounted rate?

14

on delivery, who's not asking even for 30 days, is that

15

also --

16

Wouldn't there be something even more

MR. WALLACE:

The shipper who pays

That could be, and as far as I'm

17

aware was, the same discount rate, although there might be

18

some further discount for cash payment which is not

19

reflected in anything I've read in this case.

20

Mr. Gumport could clarify that.

21

QUESTION:

Perhaps

So does the bureau rate -- it

22

certainly doesn't apply to one who pays promptly.

23

apply to anything other than this liquid -- as a

24

liquidated damage --

25

MR. WALLACE:

Does it

So far as I'm aware, it does not.

It is not

it is a

1

There's no indication that it does.

2

source from which the real rates, the real filed rates

3

are -- the discount rates, it's a source from which the

4

discount rates are calculated.
So that it's a source -- it's a rate bureau

5
6

source that determines the proportionality of what are the

7

real rates, which are the discount rates, and the only way

8

that this record reflects that those rates come into play

9

at all is not as what I think are accurately regarded as

10

rates for transportation, but as the measure of the

11

liquidated damages for collection costs that is authorized

12

under these regulations under the collection expense

charges in little point (ii) at the top of page 84a of the

14

appendix.

damages that is authorized under this rule, if the rule is

complied with.

17

That is one method of calculating liquidated

Now, the rule was designed specifically to

18

forestall precisely the problem that arose here by

19

conditioning the availability of these liquidated damage

20

charges on compliance with certain safeguards for the

21

shippers.

22

23

QUESTION:

Well, could the trustee, in an action

brought by the shipper, raise this as a defense?

MR. WALLACE:

25

other way around that it occurs.

Well, ordinarily it's -- it's the

1

their payments and would not be bringing an action.

It's

2

the trustee who is trying to get additional payments from

3

the shippers through the bankruptcy proceedings.

4

He has made claims against them, and the -- this

5

Court's holding in Southern Pacific Transportation Company

6

v. Commercial Metals suggests that the shippers cannot

7

themselves raise a defense, and we have briefed the case

8

on that assumption.

9

QUESTION:

Well, I was going to ask you, do you

10

have a position as to whether or not the defense is

11

available in the action itself?

12

MR. WALLACE:

We have briefed the case on the

13

assumption that it would not be available to the shippers

14

under the rationale of the Commercial Metals case, but I

15

think in candor an argument could be made that Commercial

16

Metals should not extend that far because what was

17

directly involved in Commercial Metals was an effort not

18

to pay the transportation rate itself, which --

19

QUESTION:

Well, if it's an invalid rate, then

20

under our K Mart line of -- under the K Mart case, it

21

would seem to me that it's just a nonenforceable rate in

22

the court, and it would seem to me that that would almost

23

have to be the premise if you're to prevail here.

24

quite sure why there should be a difference.

25

MR. WALLACE:

I'm not

Well, we do take some solace from

1

the K Mart case.

I don't want to overdraw the analogy,

2

because the Court determined there that there was no

3

valid, filed rate.

4

ascertained from tariff filings and the Court said that

5

that could not prevail over a violation of the

6

Commission's regulations, and in that way the case is very

7

analogous to our case.

There was a rate that could be

8

But Commercial Metals held, in the context of an

9

effort by the shipper not to pay the transportation charge

10

at all, the transportation rate, that the shipper could

11

not raise that as a defense, that if there's to be a

12

challenge to it because of violation of the Commission's

13

credit regulations, and that is the only case of this

14

Court that deals with a claim of violation of the credit

15

regulations, that is to be enforced in the courts by the

16

ICC.

17

The reason I think that an argument could be

18

made by shippers that Commercial Metals doesn't extend as

19

far as this case is because in this case what is sought to

20

be collected is not the rate for transportation or

21

services that the statute requires to be in a tariff as a

22

rate filing.

23

transaction if the payment were made promptly, plus

24

whatever interest there would be for delay in payment,

25

precisely what the ICC's requested injunction would limit

That rate is what would be payable in the

1

the trustee to collecting here.
What is sought to be collected in addition are

2

3

these liquidated damages called collection expense charges

4

authorized by the regulation beginning on page 83a, which

5

are in the tariff, but not because the statute requiring

6

the rates for transportation or services require it to be

7

in the tariff -- those statutes we've set forth in our

8

brief on page 74a and 75a of the appendix to the

9

petition -- but instead it's because the regulation itself

10

requires that those liquidated damage rates be in the

11

tariff.

12

They're entirely a creature of the regulation,

13

and that is on 84a of the petition appendix under 2(i),

14

"Shall be described in the tariff rule," and (ii) says,

15

"Shall be applied without unlawful prejudice and/or unjust

16

discrimination."

17

Those requirements are creatures of the

18

regulation, just as the authorization to collect these

19

charges at all are creatures of the regulation, and the

20

Commission, as I started to say at the outset, is acting

21

in an area where Congress expressly relied on the

22

Commission's regulations to set the rule.

23

Congress proscribed altogether any credit

24

transactions here except pursuant to regulations which the

25

Commission may adopt, so the Commission was acting really
10

1

at the zenith of its regulatory powers in fulfilling a

2

mandate that Congress expressly relied on the Commission

3

and only the Commission to fulfill here.

4

So regardless of whether the shippers could

5

raise a defense, what Commercial Metals looked to was an

6

even more venerable provision of the act that dates back

7

to the original Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, the

8

statutory authority for the Commission to bring an

9

enforcement action in Federal court, and the Court in

10

Commercial Metals emphasized that that could be an

11

injunctive action to enforce the credit regulations.

12

It should be remembered that at the time of the

13

Commercial Metals decision in 1982, the credit regulations

14

did not yet authorize this liquidated damages for the cost

15

of collection, and the only defense being made by the

16

shipper was a defense not to have to pay the filed rate

17

for transportation itself.

18

So there might have been anticipation that the

19

Commission would be unlikely to bring an injunctive action

20

which would say that the carrier should not be paid at all

21

for the transportation, even in the circumstance where the

22

carrier did not fully comply with the credit regulations,

23

but at least as the Court interpreted the act, that was to

24

be left to the Commission's enforcement authority rather

25

than an equitable defense by the shippers.

1

Well, since the conditions admittedly were not

2

complied with for assessing the liquidated damages, it

3

might seem obvious, in light of Commercial Metals and the

4

Commission's enforcement authority in 49 U.S.C. 11702 that

5

I've referred to, that the Commission's action to enjoin

6

this belated effort of the trustee acting in perfect good

7

faith to try to enhance the value of the estate, to enjoin

8

this effort to collect liquidated damages when these very

9

carefully constructed conditions had not been complied

10

with to the obvious prejudice of the shippers whom the

11

conditions were designed to protect, and that the trustee,

12

standing in the shoes of Transcon, should be relegated to

13

the historic remedy that existed from 1920 to 1988 of the

14

transportation charge plus interest for any lateness in

15

the payment, obviously a remedy that could not be said to

16

be incompatible with the act.

17

The court of appeals, however, said no, that

18

that rather obvious conclusion should not be reached

19

because of the filed rate doctrine as it understood that

20

doctrine to have been applied by this Court in Maislin

21

Industries v. Primary Steel.

22

Now, we think that this was misconceived by the

23

court of appeals from the outset, and the first thing to

24

be said is that Maislin, in contrast to this case,

25

involved an effort to enforce an unfiled rate, the
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

negotiated rate which was never filed, but under the

2

Commission's then negotiated rates policy was to be

3

enforced in preference to the actual filed rate.

4

And Maislin itself, in footnote 11 of the

5

Maislin opinion, pointed out that the case was therefore

6

different from prior decisions of the Court in which the

7

question was which of two filed rates should be applied,

8

rather than an effort to depart from the filed rate

9

schedule altogether.

10

And we think that that footnote applies a

11

fortiori in this case, because here it's not a choice

12

between two filed rates for transportation, it's a choice

13

between the filed rate for transportation, which the

14

Commission says the trustee is entitled to, and this other

15

charge of liquidated damages that is not a filed rate for

16

transportation within the meaning of the statutes that

17

require rates for transportation and services to be

18

provided, but as I previously explained is entirely a

19

creature of the regulations which is required to be in the

20

tariff only because the regulations require it to be in

21

the tariff.

That is the source of the obligation.

22

Then this Court decided Reiter v. Cooper after

23

the court of appeals' initial decision, which we thought

24

made the error more manifest because Reiter established

25

quite clearly the principle that Maislin did not mean that
13

1

the filed rate doctrine would preclude claims and defenses

2

that are specifically accorded by the act itself, such as

3

the Commission's express statutory authority to bring an

4

action for an injunction to enforce its credit

5

regulations.

6

So when we petitioned for certiorari for the

7

first time in this case, we suggested that the judgment be

8

vacated and the case remanded for reconsideration in light

9

of Reiter v. Cooper, which is the course that the Court

10

took, but on remand the court of appeals reached the same

11

conclusion, basically holding that the ICC statutory

12

enforcement authority should be subordinated to its view

13

of the filed rate doctrine, which is --

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, did that occur in the

Ninth Circuit after reargument and fresh briefing, or when

MR. WALLACE:

Not reargued, just rebriefed,

So it seemed to us that what the Court held was

merely, to the contrary of Reiter, that the express

statutory provision should be subordinated to the Court's

1

view of the filed rate doctrine, which is just the

2

opposite of the way the Court came out in Reiter.

3

And it also -- in its rationale on remand it

4

seemed to us the Court intruded into and effectively

5

nullified the ICC's enforcement discretion with respect to

6

what remedy it can seek among the remedies expressly given

7

to the Commission for the credit regulation violations,

8

and the Ninth Circuit said other remedies will suffice.

9

But those other remedies, while they might

10

suffice against operating characters -- carriers because

11

of their prospective nature, would be of little

12

assistance, if any, in the context of the trustee in

13

bankruptcy, who is trying to dun shippers for these

14

charges years after the shipment.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I'm not sure I quite

16

understand what the Government's position is regarding

17

provisions that are in rate filings because they are

18

required to be there by these regulations.

19

position that somehow they do not enjoy the protections

20

that other provisions of the rates enjoy?

21

MR. WALLACE:

Is it your

Well, I wouldn't say quite that

22

they don't enjoy the protections, but it is important that

23

they're not required by statute to be filed rates that

24

govern, rather than any contract to the contrary, the

25

payment for transportation and services, and -15

QUESTION:

1

Aren't there a number of things that

2

might be optionally included in rates but do not have to

3

be included in rates?

4

MR. WALLACE:

We think that these are rules

5

relating to the rates,

6

about what is to be done in the nonpayment, but part of

7

the relevance of this in the case is that respondents are

arguing in some of their amici that there would be

13

QUESTION:

Do you think that's because of

14

enforcement discretion, because you could move against

15

some and not against others?

16

MR. WALLACE:

Well,

I don't want to make their

17

argument for them.

18

the prohibition against unjust discrimination that is

19

involved here is only the prohibition in the Commission's

own regulations, which the Commission is entitled to

considerable deference in construing,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD L. GUMPORT

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GUMPORT:

please the Court:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The Government concedes in its brief in this
Court that the loss of discount tariff provision is
lawful.

The Government also concedes in its brief in this

10

Court that the regulations still do not create a defense

11

to payment of the filed rate assertable by shippers.

12

This is therefore a simple case, because

13

Congress has explicitly addressed the issue in the

14

statute.

15

unless and until this tariff is rendered ineffective, set

16

QUESTION:

Not if you read the filed rate as the

3

discounted rate, and the liquidated -- what you call the

4

bureau rate, what they call the liquidated damage

5

provision, if you read that as simply a credit term,

6

not -- the filed rate, the rate is the discounted rate.

7

Then, if you don't pay up on time there's this liquidated

damage provision.

9

MR. GUMPORT:

Justice Ginsburg, if one could

10

reasonably do that, that would be right, but in this case

11

it was impossible to do that, and there's at least four

12

reasons why it's impossible.

13

First of all, the tariff is unambiguous.

14

There's no dispute that under the express terms of the

15

tariff a shipper is not entitled to the discount unless it

16

pays the tariff charge within 90 days, and only then --

17

only then is it entitled to the discount, and when certain

18

shipper amici tried to argue to the contrary, they had to

19

change the language of the tariff to make that argument.

20

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't the Commission's own

21

rules be treated as a supplement to the tariff, since

22

admittedly you can have this higher rate, bureau rate,

23

liquidated damage rate, you can have it only by virtue of

24

the credit provisions, so why not say, as a supplement to

25

this tariff, we read in the ICC conditions, forgetting the

liquidated damages, put it in the bill, 90 days passes,

3

regulations in effect be treated as a supplement to the

4

tariff?
MR. GUMPORT:

5

There are several reasons, Your

6

Honor.

First of all, it's contrary to this Court's

7

decision in Davis v. Portland Seed, where a carrier had

8

filed a tariff that contained a higher rate for the

9

shorter route than for the longer route, and the tariff

10

was arguably unlawful on its face.

11

express provisions of the statute, and this Court said, it

12

doesn't matter, it's the filed rate, and unless and until

13

the ICC suspends or sets it aside --

15

QUESTION:

It was contrary to the

That was for the purpose of a defense

by the shipper, isn't that right --

It seems to me it just can't be that the

who doesn't pay within 90 days, the CEO shall be shot.

I mean, obviously it's

unlawful and you can't perform it.
MR. GUMPORT:

could retroactively reject that kind of tariff, it could
reject it, it could suspend it, and that is not this case

tariff provision, there would be criminal penalties for
doing that, and indeed, in Maislin, in the Maislin
decision -QUESTION:

How can you have criminal penalties

for complying with Federal law?

You're telling me that

you're obliged to perform that contract by the

MR. GUMPORT:

Your Honor, it's a question of

3

remedy, because in the Maislin case there was no question,

4

and the Court pointed out in footnote 12 of its decision

5

that if the carrier was lying to shippers about what it's

6

real rates were, it was a crime, and nevertheless in

7

Maislin the Court held that the ICC could not have a valid

8

policy which created a remedy that operated to prevent the

carrier from enforcing its filed rate.

And in this case we don't dispute that the ICC

11

has a remedy.

The only reason that you can have this two-

in the two-track system, other than the credit

3

MR. GUMPORT:

Your Honor, there is nothing in

5

of discount tariff provision except under our credit

say that, nothing at all.

There's nothing in those regulations that

8

Let me return to your earlier question.

9

QUESTION:

Please clarify for me, then, the

10

extent to which you disagree with Mr. Wallace, who said

11

this was not possible until the eighties rulemaking.

12

Until then, you got the interest for late payment, it was

13

only that rulemaking that brought in the credit

14

regulations, and one way of calculating the liquidated

15

damages was having this additional tariff.

16

that you had these two-track systems, the discounted rate

17

and the higher rate, before there were any credit

18

regulations?

19

MR. GUMPORT:

Is it true

Your Honor, in 1985, the ICC

20

authorized the filing of tariffs giving discounts for

21

early payment, and in that 1985 regulatory decision they

22

said, we're not sure you can do this, but we're now

specifically authorizing you to do it.

answered my question.

Did you -- were there these two-

2

track tariff systems before the eighties rulemaking?

3

MR. GUMPORT:

4

Let me return to your question as to whether

5

Your Honor, I don't know.

there are two filed rates.

There's only one filed rate.

6

The ICC, in its 1988 decision authorizing the

7

filing of loss of discount tariff provisions, said that

8

under the filed rate doctrine the carrier must enforce the

9

loss of discount tariff provision.

10

In the trial court, before Judge Hill heard the

11

issue that he disposed of by summary judgment, he

12

specifically asked the ICC's counsel whether it agreed

13

that the loss of discount tariff provision, which is a

14

part of the rules tariff, whether the ICC agreed that the

15

rules tariffs were a part of the carrier's filed rate

16

within the meaning of Maislin, and the ICC's counsel

17

responded, yes, I don't take issue with that.

18

The ICC also put in a declaration from a tariff

19

expert, a Mr. Manning, on November 8, 1991, in support of

20

its cross motion for summary judgment, and he said in his

21

declaration that Transcon's TCON 625, which is the

22

discount tariff, is governed by Transcon's TCON 103, which

23

is the rules tariff, in which the loss of discount tariff

24

provision appears.

25

So there is no dispute, and there was no dispute

calculating liquidated damages, so was your answer to

Justice Scalia that it's both?

it is a rate, and the issue before this Court is the

3

remedy, and Congress has said what the remedy should be.

4

I would also say, it doesn't matter, because

QUESTION:

I'm curious abut the statute.

Isn't

5

there a statute here?

6

but if I do, I thought that the -- there is a statute that

7

governs the tariff, and it says that you can't have a

8

tariff that allows a person credit, except "under

9

regulations of the Commission," so the statute seems to

I may not understand it correctly,

10

say the only reason you could have this provision in the

11

tariff is because you will file, follow, regulations of

12

the Commission.

13

And now I take it what the Commission said is,

14

you did follow regulations of the Commission when you put

15

that in, you did follow regulations of the Commission when

16

you accepted the freight on credit, but you did not follow

17

the regulations of the Commission when you sought damages,

18

because you can't seek damages aggregate, and you have to

19

present your bill within 7 days, or something like that,

20

under the regulations of the Commission.

21

MR. GUMPORT:

whether the regulations were violated.

MR. GUMPORT:

Now, maybe it doesn't.

That's

This statute's language says one

important thing about what's to be in the regulations.

says that the regulations are to be regulations

Maybe I don't have it right.

It

says, "governing the payment for transportation and
service and --

11

Yes, but I take it this was governing

the payment for transportation.

14

MR. GUMPORT:

Your Honor, there's no question

15

that it's governing the payment, but the question is, what

16

is the remedy, and the statutory language tells us not

17

only that they govern payment but that they are to be

19

discrimination is a judicially defined term.

20

It was judicially defined in this Court's Texas

case, which was quoted with approval in the MCI case --

MR. GUMPORT:

1

They are unlawful insofar as they

2

are applied to create a judicial injunction preventing the

3

carrier from performing its statutory duty to collect the

4

filed rate, and that's because, just as in Maislin, there

5

was a broad grant of power to the Commission to prohibit

6

unreasonable practices.

7

Here we have a statute that uses the words,

8

"preventing discrimination," and "preventing

9

discrimination" are judicially defined words that mean

10

adherence to the filed rate, so what these -- what the

11

statute tells us is the one remedy that the ICC cannot

12

provide for in its regulations is the remedy of directing

13

the carrier not to adhere to its tariff rate.

14

QUESTION:

And that's simply because of the

15

term -- the statute says one of the things is preventing

discrimination?

words?

You place all that weight on those two

MR. GUMPORT:

on those two words, which have been defined -- were

defined by this Court before those words were put in the

2

credit rules of the Commission serve three basic purposes.
One is, they exist for the benefit of the

3

carrier, and the ICC in its brief in this Court doesn't

4

deny that, but here it's seeking to enforce the credit

5

rules for the benefit of the shipper, and the credit rules

6

are also to serve the additional two purposes of

7

preventing discrimination, which this Court has always

8

held, right through MCI, last term -- that there is an

9

indissoluble unity.

10

That's -- those are the words of the Court in

11

the Texas & Pacific case, those are the words of the Court

12

in MCI Telecommunications, that there's an indissoluble

13

unity between a carrier's duty to adhere to the filed rate

14

and the statutory goal of preventing discrimination.

15

In addition, the Court also explained in

16

Commercial Metals that the other purpose of the credit

17

rules is to protect the working -- the capital structure

18

of the carrier, yet here, the credit rules are to be

19

applied to prevent the carrier from recovering funds that

20

it needs to pay its creditors.

I would emphasize on that is, that -- it just doesn't

15

QUESTION:

I think that -- I think one thing

Well, the thing that I'm puzzled

16

about is, there's a valid regulation out there that's been

17

violated, and the Commission says they want this remedy,

18

and you're saying, well, there's some other remedy, but

19

the other remedy that you describe is the functional

20

equivalent of this one, as I understand it.

21

MR. GUMPORT:

It's not, Your Honor, because

22

under the Interstate Commerce Act so long as the rate is

23

in effect there is a civil and criminal duty to comply,

24

and the one remedy that they're asking for is what the

25

statute commands they can't have.

They can fine Transcon.

that will realistically enforce these rules?
MR. GUMPORT:

8

9

Your Honor, I don't -- it seems to

me that the ultimate sanction of the Government for people

10

who violate its rules is to throw them in jail, and the

11

people who used to run Transcon are all still around

12

running another trucking company, and it would have a

13

salutary effect on the trucking industry, if the ICC

14

really wants to stop, make people comply with their

regulations, to go out and prosecute them.

How about the trustee, because of the

MR. GUMPORT:

Your Honor, that's -- first of

all, the regulations as interpreted by the ICC only apply

The Commission says we

don't want them picking and choosing, all there to stop

How do you respond to that?

MR. GUMPORT:

And I'm saying they can enforce

that any way they want to, except in one way, and that is

8

to sue the carrier to prevent it from performing its

9

statutory duty to charge and collect its filed rate unless

Even the filed rate that

12

discriminates, because it does discriminate, since it

13

violates these regs.

14

MR. GUMPORT:

Your Honor, I would disagree,

15

because the Court has defined discrimination as being per

16

se occurring when a carrier is disregarding its tariff

17

rate.

18

from Texas & Pacific Railroad v. Abilene Cotton through

19

MCI Telecommunications.

20

That is the teaching of the filed rate doctrine

The rule of this Court has always been, it is

21

discriminatory when a carrier departs from its filed rate

22

unless and until the ICC sets it aside, and in your

23

hypothetical, Justice Breyer, the Commission could

24

prosecute people for wilfully disobeying the credit

regulations.

It could also sue a carrier prospectively

2

have to let people know, and it could get contempt

3

penalties for violation of that injunction.
What it couldn't do is to say, you violated our

credit regulations.

Therefore, even though we've done

6

nothing with your tariff, even though we concede that your

7

tariff is lawful, even though the statutory provisions of

the act say you must charge and collect your tariff

provision and you shall go to jail if you disregard it, we

still want an injunction against you stopping you from

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

Mr. Wallace, tell me why this is

different from the case where -- that Justice Ginsburg

7

asked about.
Even if the filed rate violated the statute, the

8

9

filed rate doctrine would apply, and it would have to be

10

set aside before it could be collected, and you're coming

11

in and saying, ah, but if it violates a regulation, that's

12

different.

13

MR. WALLACE:

MR. WALLACE:

Well --

That doesn't seem to make much sense.
-- that isn't the only thing that

one.

It's -- the suggestion that the Commission

This, the liquidated damages provision as it

21

appears in the tariff could have been lawfully enforced if

complied with, so there was no basis for striking it from

the tariff.

25

If the tariff had also said, and these

1

liquidated damages can be assessed on an aggregated basis,

2

not merely on an individual basis, that would have been a

3

provision that the Commission could have struck from the

4

tariff.
But what good would it have done the Commission

5
6

to strike that from the tariff when under the respondent's

7

submission the same result could be reached anyway,

8

because the liquidated damages provision itself remains in

9

the tariff, and that has to be enforceable regardless of

10

violations of the safeguards that were placed in the

11

Commission's regulation.
And I want to say, in response to a question

12

13

raised by Justice Ginsburg, on page 33a of the petition

14

for certiorari appendix the court of appeals discusses the

15

meager case authority, in the first paragraph on that

16

page, that existed about efforts to try to include

17

liquidated damages provisions before they were authorized

18

by regulation.

have them solely as a creature of tariff were correctly
