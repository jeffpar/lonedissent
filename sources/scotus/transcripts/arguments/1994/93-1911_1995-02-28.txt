ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN SCOTT MICHAELS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MICHAELS:

8

9

Cinda Sandin v. Demont Connor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case comes to this Court from the Ninth

10
11

Circuit's decision holding that Hawaii Administrative Rule

12

17-201-18(b),

13

interest entitling every inmate in the Hawaii penal system

14

to a procedural due process review under the standards of

15

Wolff v. McDonnell for every assignment to disciplinary

16

segregation of 4 hours or more.

17

our burden-of-proof rule,

creates a liberty

In so holding, the Ninth Circuit ignored nearly

18

a half-dozen decisions of this Court that characterize the

19

Wolff case as applying solely to regimes that threaten the

20

loss of good-time credit.

21

system of good-time credit, nor does even our parole

22

system make a disciplinary finding a necessary impact on

23

parole.

QUESTION:

The State of Hawaii has no

But it does make it a relevant

finding.

MR. MICHAELS:

1

It is relevant in the sense that

2

a bad disciplinary record can be but need not be a basis

3

for the denial of parole.

4

QUESTION:

Right.

They could say this person's

5

record is terrible, he clearly is not a good candidate for

6

a trouble-free life if released, so we're not going to

7

parole, or they could say, this person's record is

8

terrible, let's get him out of here as soon as we can.

9

They've got that choice.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. MICHAELS:

Yes, and Justice Souter, I would

12

say that the driving force for parole decisions today in

13

our State would be prison overcrowding.

14

another reason for granting early parole.

15

That would be

But it has no necessary impact, and inmates who

16

have very good records in prison could be denied parole

17

for any number of reasons, and inmates that have very bad

18

records in prison could be granted parole for a number of

19

reasons.

20

The Ninth Circuit also ignored a lengthy summary

21

judgment record that tells us what Demont Connor's

22

assignment to disciplinary segregation actually meant in

23

real-world terms.

24

in disciplinary segregation, to Module A, and Module A was

the most restrictive general population module in the

to disciplinary segregation meant only the loss of certain

3

privileges, and was not a major change in the conditions

of his confinement.

5

As a result, his assignment

We ask the Court, as it decides this case, to

6

keep five things in mind.

First, disciplinary confinement

7

is only one stopping point along a continuum of

8

penalogical responses, and is merely the combination of

9

one set of privileges in lieu of another and we submit

10

that, unless the court is prepared to federalize through

11

the Due Process Clause all State-created privileges in

12

prison, it must reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit

13

below.

14

QUESTION:

Before you continue with that, would

15

you just step back for a moment?

16

difference was the loss of certain privileges.

17

be specific about what it was, what the loss consisted of?

18

MR. MICHAELS:

You said the only
Could you

Right, and Justice Ginsburg, I

19

would refer Your Honor to the guidelines that begin on

20

page 125 of the Joint Appendix.

21

provisions, and I'm prepared to discuss those.

22

There are a number of

When the inmate was in Module A, he was subject

23

to lock-down already for 16 hours a day.

24

disciplinary confinement, his amount of lock-down time

25

increased, but the inmate was also entitled to out-of5

When he went to

1

cell exercise time, shower five times a week, religious

2

counseling, legal counseling, as well as a monthly visit

3

with his family, non-contact visit.

4

The number of visits went down.

It would have

5

gone down from eight to one.

He would have lost the one

6

telephone call that he could make of a personal nature,

7

although he would have had the right to make legal,

8

official phone calls to counsel or to the State Ombudsman.

9

In addition, the inmate would have lost, when he moved

10

from Module A, the right to watch television and to

11

receive certain newspapers, but he would be entitled to

12

have both religious and nonreligious reading materials in

13

the disciplinary holding unit.

14

QUESTION:

Is there a third alternative for us?

15

You spoke of federalizing everything, of limiting

16

interests only to those that affect prison time, and so

17

on.

18

a de minimis rule here?

19

MR. MICHAELS:

Is there a third alternative of devising some kind of

Justice Souter, I suppose that

20

because the concept of de minimis does exist in the law,

21

that one could have that, but it would mean that a very

22

large number of privileges that from a subjective sense to

23

the prisoner would not be viewed as de minimis would be

24

eligible for procedural due process protection.

25

QUESTION:

Well, I presume we'd have an

1

objective de minimis rule.
MR. MICHAELS:

2

Even then, in an objective test,

3

I would think the category of de minimis, if the Court is

4

going to treat it as it has been treated in the law, would

5

mean that only a very small number of changes would be

6

exempt from Federal judicial scrutiny.
QUESTION:

7
8

It wouldn't be worth the trouble,

from your standpoint, to have a de minimis rule?
MR. MICHAELS:

9

We think that the longstanding

10

theme of this Court's decisions dealing with prison

11

management, that - -

12

QUESTION:

Well, would it -- just from your

13

standpoint, from your client's standpoint, would it be

14

worth your while to have such a rule?

15

MR. MICHAELS:

16

QUESTION:

17

Would you rather have all or nothing,

in effect, rather than have a de minimis rule?
MR. MICHAELS:

18
19

It would be better than --

We don't think that line is

administrable, no, Your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

Okay.

21

QUESTION:

Well, what you're asking for is a

22

form of de minimis rule, except it's not really de

23

minimis.

24

no loss of good-time credit, and no necessary impact on

25

parole, then you would not construe voluntarily adopted

You're asking for a rule that says where there's

1

prison regulations as creating a liberty interest.
MR. MICHAELS:

2

3

In that sense, Mr. Chief Justice,

yes.

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

I dare say that's not what

5

Justice Souter meant about a de minimis, and perhaps you

6

wouldn't describe it as de minimis, but you're asking for

7

some sort of a cut-off.

8

MR. MICHAELS:

9

Yes.

Our position is that the

line for eligibility for due process protection should be

10

drawn at good-time credits, or a finding that has a

11

necessary impact on a parole date.
QUESTION:

12

What is the underlying theory for

13

that?

That describes the test.

14

but what is the theoretical justification for drawing the

15

line there?
MR. MICHAELS:

16

It describes the line,

Your Honor, we ask the Court in

17

this case to look at the structure of cases such as Wolff

18

v. McDonnell, as well as the extensive progeny in this

19

area.

20

The underlying theme of this Court's decisions

21

is that prison managers need flexibility and discretion,

22

and to the extent the Constitution intrudes upon that by

23

weighing procedural due process requirements upon them,

24

the Court has always been solicitous of categories of

25

conduct that are meaningfully different from one another.

For example, in the Wolff case itself, the Court

1

2

distinguished between parole revocation, where the person

3

is already out, and good-time credits where the person is

4

in but has earned a certain expectation of getting out by

5

a particular day.
We think that this case is categorically

6

7

different from even that situation, the good-time credit

8

case, and that the appropriate constitutional response is

9

to say that this is not an area -- even where for

10

management reasons we may have mandatory rules, that this

11

is not an area, Justice Kennedy, where the Due Process

12

Clause should be the constitutional protection.
One of the points that I make, and I make it

13
14

now, is that we do submit that there will still be

15

backstop constitutional protection against arbitrary

16

assignments to disciplinary segregation, but the source of

17

that right should not be the variegated and sometimes

18

complex requirements of the procedural Due Process Clause,

19

but it would be the requirement of minimum rationality

20

under the Equal Protection Clause.
QUESTION:

May I ask you to test your position

1

who received a particular kind of punishment were denied

2

parole for an extra year, and also that the -- whenever

3

they got this particular punishment, they were put in

4

isolation for, say, 8 months, not cruel and unusual

5

punishment, but a dramatically different situation.

6

7
8

9

Under your rule, I would suppose there's simply
no review of the procedures that would precede that.
MR. MICHAELS:

There would be review under the

Equal Protection Clause --

10

QUESTION:

Yes, but I'm assuming no --

11

MR. MICHAELS:

12

QUESTION:

-- for minimum rationality.

-- no racial charge, nothing like

13

that, just the person who made the decision, the argument

14

would be, he acted arbitrarily because the crime -- I

15

mean, the offense was not nearly so -- you know, whatever

16

the reason might be, but you have to assume total

17

discretion on the warden to use the kind of punishment I

18

suggest, even if 99 percent of the time, in fact, it would

19

mean an extra year in prison.

20

MR. MICHAELS:

Several answers, Your Honor.

21

First, as to what the empirical result would be on parole,

22

the Court has already held in cases like the Dumschat

23

case, I believe, that that empirical evidence is not

24

relevant to the procedural due process question.

25

QUESTION:

You may be right as a matter -- all

1

I'm asking you, am I not correctly describing the

2

situation that your rule would tolerate?
MR. MICHAELS:

3

Our rule would not tolerate it if

4

this was a charge that was simply made up.

5

is that --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MICHAELS:

Our position

Why not?
Because, as even this Court's

8

cases recognize, although the equal protection line of

9

arguments, the rational basis test, is a very lenient

10

test, it is not a toothless test, and that, for example,

11

City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, the Court

12

actually will require some evidence to show that there is

13

a rational basis for the assignment.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

So there would be judicial review of

the sufficiency of the evidence, under your test?
MR. MICHAELS:

Our position is that there would

17

be only a minimal evidence requirement, but yes, there

18

could be judicial review, so that --

19

QUESTION:

But it would be a procedural

20

requirement in my case, of minimum evidence?

21

the position I understood your brief to advocate.

22

MR. MICHAELS:

That's not

I believe the -- in my discussion

23

with you that we're at least clarifying our brief.

24

think that the brief was clear, but I'd like to clarify

25

the brief in that regard.

Because of the way the equal protection works,

1

2

in court we would obviously have to produce some evidence,

3

under our theory, to justify the detention.

QUESTION:

1

It's frankly news to me that the Equal Protection Clause

2

is an evidentiary guarantee.

Do you have any cases that -

3
4

MR. MICHAELS:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. MICHAELS:

Yes.

What's that?
I can understand Your Honor's

7

concern that as a general matter, when reviewing

8

legislation, the court will use the imagined rational

9

basis standard, but even cases like -- but in cases where

10

there are as-applied equal protection challenges, and

11

these challenges could be brought now, but obviously the

12

litigants don't do - - the plaintiffs don't do that,

13

because they have a howitzer with the procedural Due

14

Process Clause.

15

Under the Cleburne case, the Court actually

16

required in an as-applied equal protection challenge some

17

rational connection between a legitimate interest and what

18

the Government was doing in that case.

19

QUESTION:

Isn't there a good reason to think

20

that the Cleburne case was something of a sport, in view

21

of our subsequent equal protection jurisprudence?

22

MR. MICHAELS:

Well, we do offer that as the

23

support for what the constitutional backstop would be if

24

the Court wanted to go in that way.

25

QUESTION:

I don't think it's a backstop.

I

1

think you're asking us to jump out of the frying pan into

2

the fire and create a whole new constitutional equal

3

protection jurisprudence that allows all sorts of factual

4

decisions by every State and locality to be reviewed on

5

equal protection grounds.

That's a whole new territory.

I mean, maybe Hawaii likes it, but I don't view

6

7

it as a great assistance to the problem of

8

overintrusiveness of the Federal Government into these

9

matters.

10
11

12

MR. MICHAELS:

Well, it would be a minimal test,

and at the same time, Your Honor, we -QUESTION:

Yes, but may I interrupt you?

You

13

say it would be a minimal test.

14

wouldn't be a much more complicated test than the one that

15

you've got now, because the issue now is whether certain

16

procedural options were provided to the prisoner.

17

seems to me something fairly simple to litigate, even

18

though it may provoke a certain degree of nuisance

19

litigation for you.

20

I don't see why it

That

But if, in fact, a minimal sufficiency of

21

evidence criterion is going to take its place, I would

22

suppose that that was going to be rather more complicated

23

to litigate, because you're going to have to establish

24

what’was there in the -- before the parole -- before the

25

prison warden, or whatever the disciplinary committee is.

1

It seems to me that you're asking for the

2

substitution of a very complicated procedure in place of a

3

comparatively simple one.
MR. MICHAELS:

4

I'd respectfully disagree,

5

Justice Souter, because the present system is not only as

6

complicated as you make it, but even much more so, because

7

under Superintendent v. Hill we do have to provide already

8

some evidence, and so we already would have to meet that
component under procedural due process analysis.
QUESTION:

10

Well, is there any reason to believe

11

things would be simpler on a sufficiency of -- minimal

12

sufficiency of evidence test?
MR. MICHAELS:

13

Yes, indeed, because there are at

14

least several other aspects of procedural due process

15

protections, namely the requirement of a contemporary

16

statement, and there are all kinds of conflicts that arise

17

as to what has to go in the statement, how specific the

18

reference has to be to the evidence, and these provoke a

1

great amount of litigation, and in this case particularly,

the issue of witnesses.

analysis.

22

QUESTION:

Those would disappear under our

Well, suppose the prison authorities

transferred the prisoner to solitary confinement, and he

says, there's no reason for doing this, and they said, oh,

we've heard a rumor that you're a troublemaker.

Does that

1

2

suffice?
MR. MICHAELS:

I would say that being a

3

troublemaker per se is not governed by the specific rules

4

that we have in our institution.

5

QUESTION:

No, I mean in this hypothetical

6

regime, where we don't have procedural due process

7

protections to any degree, but we do have a minimum

8

requirement of some rationality, would the case that I put

9

fit within that requirement and meet that requirement?

10

MR. MICHAELS:

I would have to answer that,

11

Justice Kennedy, yes and no.

12

basis analysis one would be going outside of what -- the

13

specific rules the prison has in terms of defining the

14

legitimate State interest.

15

QUESTION:

Yes, if in the rational

No, you don't have a rule.

The rule

16

is that the prison authorities can do what's for the best

17

interests of the prison, of prison management.

18

MR. MICHAELS:

19

QUESTION:

Then the answer would be yes.

I'm trying to follow Justice Souter's

20

point, which is to try to explore whether or not the

21

regime we would be substituting is really much of an

22

improvement, and so I put you the case of an assignment to

23

solitary confinement based on a rumor that he's a

24

troublemaker, and I want to know if that meets the minimum

MR. MICHAELS:

3

Yes.

We submit that that would

QUESTION:

4

What would be the inquiry, whether

the person was in fact a troublemaker, or whether there

that you're subject to sometimes erroneous and even

MR. MICHAELS:

1

Well, our position is that the

2

Equal Protection Clause requires a rational basis for the

3

decision with respect to a legitimate State interest, and

4

it would go beyond, Your Honor, the type of suspect class

5

analysis, and this is the way we presented it in both the

6

cert petition and in our brief.

7

QUESTION:

And I take it that's based on the

8

theory, but maybe I'm wrong, that the Government must

9

always have some reason for what it does?

I don't think

10

we've ever said that, but that would be the underlying

11

theoretical justification for this principle, that the

12

Government must always have some minimum rationality for

13

whatever action it takes.

14
15

Now, we've never said that, but if that's what
you want us to say, I assume that would be the reason.

16

MR. MICHAELS:

That may well be --

Other than that, it's because there

is some kind of liberty interest, as Justice Stevens'

MR. MICHAELS:

One of the factors that this Court's existing

Yes.

10

precedents have focused upon is whether the constitutional

We disagree with that, Justice

And why do you disagree?

Is it

1

because it's discretionary, the imposition of sanctions

2

under the Hawaiian scheme?

3

MR. MICHAELS:

It's a two-part argument.

First,

4

we believe that our broader ground for reversal does

5

respond to existing precedent, because we believe existing

6

precedent asks the Court to take into account the

7

incentives that are created.

8

9

But secondly, we also believe that the
assignment is sufficiently discretionary that our case

10

falls within the kinds of language in cases such as

11

Kentucky v. Thompson and 01im v. Wakinekona, and I focus

12

the Court on two of the aspects of discretion.

13

First, the Ninth Circuit just read our rule

14

incorrectly in saying that we have a sufficiency, a

15

substantial evidence requirement.

16

201-18(b) is a duty to convict if there is substantial

17

evidence of misconduct.

18

more than mere silence in order to send a person to

disciplinary confinement.

20

QUESTION:

The mandate of Rule 17-

Our rule says that there must be

Well, doesn't that mean simply it's

21

like an administrative Fifth Amendment?

22

you can't find substantial evidence based on the silence

23

of the prisoners.

In other words,

Isn't .that all that means?

MR. MICHAELS:
that characterization.

require disciplinary confinement if there is substantial

3

there is less.
QUESTION:

4
5

Well, let me ask you a different

question.
Your -- I take it there's nothing in your rules

6

7

that expressly says, in the absence of substantial

8

evidence you may still convict?

9

that?

10

MR. MICHAELS:

11

QUESTION:

There's nothing that says

Not explicitly.

Well, you say it explicitly or you

12

don't, and I take it there's nothing that says that.

13

have all sorts of variations about punishment, but about

14

conviction, there's nothing more that is said.
MR. MICHAELS:

15

You

It's our position that the way

16

the rule is structured, that the committee can convict on

17

less.
QUESTION:

18

No, but just tell me how the rule is

19

structured, and on the question of conviction, as I

20

understand, you say two things, the rule says two things:

21

you shall convict on substantial evidence; silence is not

22

enough.

23
24
25

That's all it says, isn't it?
MR. MICHAELS:

It says that you must convict on

substantial evidence.

MR. MICHAELS:

QUESTION:

Okay.

So the Ninth Circuit says, if

it says you shall convict on substantial evidence, most

people reading that would say, you better not convict if

6

you don't have substantial evidence.

MR. MICHAELS:

9

Is that an

That's one possible reading of

the rule.

10

QUESTION:

Well, is it unreasonable?

11

MR. MICHAELS:

In light of the overall purposes,

12

we believe that it is, in light of the overall purposes of

13

the regulation.

14

QUESTION:

So is there a case somewhere -- I

15

mean, how many instances have there been in which

16

prisoners were, in fact, punished under this rule, though

17

there was a finding there was not even substantial

evidence, and they didn't admit guilt?

19

instances have there been?

How many such

20

MR. MICHAELS:

I can't cite any to the Court.

21

The other aspect of discretion that we refer the

Court to is the authority of the administrator in 17-201-

QUESTION:

find that very strange.

QUESTION:

Do you really think that's what it means?

I

It does vest --

Don't you think it means he can, you

know, review and alter the findings for some good reason?
MR. MICHAELS:

It does -- it vests greater

12

discretion in the warden because that person has -- is at

13

the top of the system and hopefully has a better

14

perspective on these questions.

QUESTION:

Isn't it an unusual interpretation of

20

that our rule doesn't track all of the options that are

I thought that that's what you -- your

5

MR. MICHAELS:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, that is our interpretation.

But that word is constantly used to

7

describe options for the appellate forum, court, and it

8

doesn't mean that a court of appeals, for example, can do

9

whatever it wants with regard to a district court decision

10

just because it has authority to affirm, reverse, or

11

modify.

12

MR. MICHAELS:

What we respond to that concern

13

is that that word has a different meaning in the prison

14

context, and at least this Court's decisions have given

15

prison administrators leeway in interpreting their rules,

16

and if one looks at the Thompson case itself, the Court

17

went quite far in defining discretion where, frankly, even

18

the State of Kentucky did not believe that there was any.

19

QUESTION:

May I ask -- I understand your

interpretation in your brief, but has that interpretation

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. HOFFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and

may it please the Court:

6

We had thought this case was about the State of

7

Hawaii's desire to be able to impose arbitrary punishment

8

in the absence of Wolff procedures.

9

arguments in response to the State's position.

10

We have three main

The first really is that the case is quite a

11

simple case under this Court's precedents, that under

12

Wolff and Hewitt it seems clear that these regulations

13

create a liberty interest because they require that there

14

be a finding of guilt, a finding of misconduct before

15

punishment can be imposed, and that starts from the very

16

beginning of the regulations in 17-201-4, that says that

17

these whole regulations are about tailoring punishment for

18

misconduct.

20
21

QUESTION:

What do you understand the test to

have been laid down in Hewitt?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Your Honor, the test that -- as I

22

understand it in Hewitt, is that the State has to restrict

23

administrative discretion in a way that would give a

24

prisoner in these circumstances a legitimate expectation

25

that the State is not going to act unless certain

specific, substantive predicates -QUESTION:

Well, Hewitt certainly doesn't say

3

that in so many words.

MR. HOFFMAN:

What Hewitt talks about is whether

5

there are substantive predicates that are laid out, and

particular standards that control administrative

7

discretion.

9

QUESTION:

But it ends up being something of an

It ends up talking about all the

arguments pro and con, and then says, on these peculiar

facts we find there was a liberty interest?

12

that's much to go on?

13
14
15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Do you think

Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, I

think it says more than that.
The Court said that the substantive predicates

16

were the need for control in those regulations and threat

17

to security, and that unless there were findings along

18

those lines, then administrative segregation in Hewitt

19

could not be imposed, and that the Pennsylvania statute

20

said that, and that if the Pennsylvania statute had said

21

that administrators could impose administrative

22

segregation for any reason, or if it left -- as in

23

Thompson, if it left the ultimate decision to the

24

administrator, free from a substantive predicate that had

to be met, then there was the kind of discretion that

de minimis exception with respect to the creation of

State-created liberty interests, or --

4

QUESTION:

Is there?

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Should there be?

Well, I have two answers, really.

6

One is, I'm not sure whether there should be under the

7

jurisprudence of the Court that says that it's the

8

weight -- the nature of the interest rather than the

9

weight.

It's Hawaii's decision to decide what's important

10

enough to handle their prison in this way, because there

11

clearly --

12

QUESTION:

Well, a rule dealing with not

13

allowing prisoners to watch violent television programs,

14

or something of that sort, are we going to get all this

15

stuff in the Federal courts?

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Justice O'Connor, what I'd say to

17

that is it probably is the case that a de minimis line

18

could be created.

19

not be covered by that kind of position.

20

I believe that in this case we would

I think from this Court's footnote 19 in Wolff

21

v. McDonnell, this Court's recognized that putting someone

22

into solitary confinement is a significant thing, and I

23

would take issue a bit with Mr. Michaels' description of

24

what happens.

2

lost the ability to work, he lost educational

3

opportunities, he was put in lock-down more.

4

There was a significant change in conditions

5

because of an act of misconduct as to which there should

be fair procedures to decide, so I think --

QUESTION:

Although they were all conditions

that he subjected himself to by committing the felony he

9

committed.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, Justice Scalia, I think that

11

if the -- this Court has repeatedly stated over the years

12

that a person does not lose all of his or her

13

constitutional rights by being in prison, and --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Exactly, and we're talking about how

many should be lost.
MR. HOFFMAN:

And it could be -- it could be, as

17

this Court said in Hewitt, that for reasons of

18

institutional management or security, that administrative

19

segregation conditions, which may even look a lot like

20

disciplinary segregation, can be imposed without this kind

21

of scrutiny under the Due Process Clause, if that's how

22

the regulations are drafted.

23

But I think there's a significant distinction,

24

and this Court's cases, I believe, have recognized that.

Even in Hewitt, the Court distinguished between

13

to do that, but I think --

They're both in prison.

MR. HOFFMAN:

There's something anomalous about

resolve the anomaly is to say that this Court would then

arbitrary punishment.
QUESTION:

3
4

In Hewitt we said it didn't didn't

we?
MR. HOFFMAN:

5

I don't think so, Chief Justice

6

Rehnquist.

In Hewitt the Court said that administrative

7

segregation was the kind of event that was in the normal

8

range or limits of confinement, and this Court at the same

9

time it was saying that, in fact I believe in either the

10

next or the prior paragraph, said that disciplinary

11

punishment was different, and that there's a big

12

difference between subjecting someone to a particular

13

classification or to administrative segregation within a

14

prison environment and putting them into adverse

15

conditions because they've done something wrong, arguably,

16

and this Court has recognized in many contexts that

17

punishment is different from measures that would be taken

18

for a regulatory purpose.

19

QUESTION:

I'm sure it is, but where is it writ

20

that that isn't one of the things that you subject

21

yourself to when you commit a crime?

subject yourself to being put in confinement because of

I mean, that's part of the bad part --

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

6

QUESTION:

Now, why isn't that

I think that the --

You can't be tortured, you can't be

7

discriminated against for all those liberty reasons that

8

are set forth in the Constitution, but doggone it, one of

9

the hard things about going to jail is sometimes you get a

10

bad warden just like sometime children have unreasonable

11

parents.

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well --

It's part of the punishment.
I think that it's inconsistent

15

with the many statements that this Court has made that

16

there's no iron curtain between the Constitution and

17

prisoners, because if the Due Process Clause means

18

anything, I think the touchstone is protection of the

19

individual against arbitrary Government conduct.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but you say you -- in answer to

21

my question you said, somebody could be treated much more

22

arbitrarily and has no rights, if the State doesn't have a

code of fair prison procedure.

There is

MR. HOFFMAN:

1

Well, I think under this Court's

2

State-created liberty interest doctrine, one of the things

3

that the Due Process Clause protects, in addition to

4

whatever it protects apart from what the State provides,

5

is that when the State provides something that a person

6

can reasonably rely on as an entitlement, that this Court

7

protects that entitlement by fair procedures, and in

8

this --

9

QUESTION:

Well, in the supposition that Justice

10

Ginsburg has put to you, where you have a State that says,

11

in the sound discretion of the warden you can be put in

12

solitary confinement, suppose that were the regime?

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

No rules.

And the warden said, I

15

think every fifth prisoner should know what it's like to

16

be in solitary, and I put you all in solitary for the

17

first 2 months of your confinements, one out of five.

18

that within the sound discretion of the warden?

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

20

QUESTION:

Well, I think that if --

And it sounds to me like it might

21

well be, but would there be an underlying due process

22

claim that you could bring to show that this was not

23

within sound discretion as that term is generally

24

understood under the law?

Is

1

open in Hewitt the question about whether there could be

2

due process claims for that kind of arbitrary decision.

3

I'm not sure about that hypothetical.

I think

4

if it was done to punish someone, I believe it would be

5

different, and that one of the reasons it would be

6

different is that the consequences of punishment, as this

7

Court also recognized in Hewitt -- in Hewitt, the Court

8

distinguished between administrative segregation and

9

disciplinary segregation in part because it found that the

10

administrative segregation had no impact on parole, likely

11

or otherwise.

12

In Hawaii, and I believe it's true in many

13

States, if there's a finding of misconduct that

14

accompanies the decision to put someone in solitary

15

confinement, that has an additional impact beyond the

16

physical change in conditions of confinement, which I

17

believe is where your question is coming from.

18

If there's a decision made for other

19

institutional interests that doesn't focus on a particular

20

person that says one in five, or you start out your

21

confinement in solitary confinement to see what it would

22

be like if you break the rules, that was -- that presents

23

a different question, I think.

there's a sound discretion standard there's going to be

some litigation under the Due Process Clause.

2

what you're saying?

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Is that

Justice Kennedy, I believe that

4

if, in fact, States gave unlimited discretion -- in fact,

5

if we went back to the days of the hands-off rule before

6

Wolff started, what would happen is, there would be a new

7

generation of litigation about what the due process

8

required in a variety of situations and I believe, and

9

certainly I would be urging, that what the ultimate result

10

of that would be, is something that looked a lot like

11

Wolff v. McDonnell and, in fact, I think Wolff v.

12

McDonnell layes out a set of procedures that are well

13

understood in the prisons of this country that are applied

14

every day in hundreds of different situations, that are

15

accepted, and about which there's not a lot of

16

controversy, and they are very deferential to the States.

17

QUESTION:

Well, counsel, after Wolff the Court

18

decided a case called Vitek v. Jones in 1980, and this is

19

what was said in that opinion:

20

conditions of confinement having a substantial adverse

21

impact on the prisoner are not alone sufficient to invoke

22

the protections of the Due Process Clause as long as the

23

conditions or degree of confinement to which the prisoner

24

is subjected is within the sentence imposed on him.

25

that changes in the

1

a long way toward ruling out these claims.

T

MR. HOFFMAN:

But this Court also said in Wolff

3

that solitary confinement should be treated in the same

4

manner, and I think that -- and in this Court in Wright v.

5

Enomoto summarily affirmed a case in which the issue of

6

disciplinary segregation that was the only one that was

7

involved.

8
9

QUESTION:

Not just solitary, because you made a

distinction between administrative segregation, so you

10

could be in solitary and you wouldn't have this right, but

11

one thing that puzzles me about this particular case, the

12

1983 action was begun at an interlocutory stage.

13

warden overturned the basic punishment.

14

the time was served, but there is no -- on this record

y

True, it's after

there is no disciplinary segregation.
16

So it's just like -- in this particular case

17

it's just like it had been an administrative segregation.

18

The terms are virtually the same, the terms of

19

incarceration, so why should we treat this like a

20

disciplinary segregation when the warden's own

21

determination has in effect changed its character?

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I don't think that the

warden's decision changed the character.

10

expunged as part of the administrative review the 30-day

sentence involved in the case, in May of 1988.

12

QUESTION:

So it's just like talking about a

13

district court decision that's been vacated by the court

of appeals.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, what is still at issue,

although not in the questions presented, is whether there

under the law.

of the harm is its disciplinary character.

understood your argument to be that if this had been
imposed purely administratively for nondisciplinary
purposes there would be no liberty interest and no due

expunged, and there is no -- presumably no chance of

I would also say, in terms of the bright line

what happens in disciplinary punishment within Hawaii and

within many States is not sufficiently important to fall

you can go to the warden -- it's certainly in that code

that you're relying on for other reasons that says you can

apply to the warden for review.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, but Wolff says that you also

7

get a chance to call witnesses to prove your point, and so

8

the due process violation that he's claiming is not that

9

he didn't get something else that he could have gotten,

10

but that he didn't get one thing that was central to his

11

point, which was to try to prove that he didn't do what

12

they said he did, and one of the things that Wolff does is

13

say that unless there is some higher institutional

interest in terms of institutional security, you get a
right to call that witness in order to be able to prove

a due process claim about whether you receive due process

I mean,

one of the problems about the facts of

this particular case is that it's not clear how Mr. Connor

would know whether in fact there was ever going to be any

action on this claim.

process?

if you take it in the Wolff context the Warden,

so he's going to get out just when he expected to.

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well,

I think that in truth the

22

amount of damages that you suffer in a case like that if

23

you're not, for example, put into solitary confinement but

24

you've lost good time alone would be very hard to

25

establish very many damages, but I think at least

theoretically, if you've been denied the process due --

you could get declaratory relief, and you could get, what

is it, $1 in damages, maybe.

You could -- you'd have your claim,

QUESTION:

But it wouldn't -- but the claim,

you'd still have the claim, on your reasoning, right?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think that the claim, if

11

there's a State-created liberty interest, or a liberty

12

interest under the Due Process Clause, you would have a

13

claim if the proper procedures are denied you, yes.

14

- that would be our position, that you do have that claim

15

If I may on the, just to address the particular

We -

16

bright line that Hawaii has set forth, the line in this

17

Court's cases has not really been about duration of

18

confinement.

19

tried to talk about things that are, I believe, things of

20

real substance, including administrative segregation.

I mean, they've tried -- this Court has

21

Where a State actually creates rules that limit

22

the imposition of administrative segregation like Hewitt,

23

this Court has found that that is certainly an important

24

enough matter that the State can be held to its word, and

25

it is an important matter and it may be that in some

1

circumstances administrative segregation would also raise

2

constitutional questions, but the line about duration of

3

confinement would first of all not be a bright line,

4

because in this case we should fall within it.

5

His duration of confinement, at least from the

6

standpoint of what the potential punishment is, clearly

7

makes this an important decision that's going to be made

8

about misconduct, and there are many different interests

9

in a prison about which prison authorities could create

10

regulations that might or might not create a liberty

11

interest, and I think --

12

QUESTION:

What the Court has basically done, I

13

guess in this area as in property, is that it's said that

14

one way of looking to see if there's a liberty or property

15

interest is to see if the discretion of the decisionmaker

16

to remove the thing from the person is significantly

17

confined or cabined by State rules or regulations, right?

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

And sometimes the problem is, that

20

protects things that seem trivial, and sometimes it

21

doesn't protect things that seem important.

22

a better way than that?

23

Now, have you

I mean, I guess the main argument for that,

24

particularly in the trivial area, is it's hard to think of

25

a better way, and do you have a suggestion, if this is

being written for something that would in a better way
distinguish the important from the trivial for purposes of
the Due Process Clause?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think it would be very

difficult to draw the line.

I mean, I've actually thought

a lot about how you would draw that line.
QUESTION:

Is there a better way, really?

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I'm not sure that there is

abetter way to draw the line.

I think that one of the

advantages of the Court's doctrine in the absence of the
better way is that it essentially leaves it up to the
States to make a certain decision.
For example, in almost every State regulation
that we looked at, if there's minor punishment, relatively
minor punishment, the procedures of Wolff are not applied.
I mean, it's much more summary procedures that look a lot
more like Hewitt, and it appears that there's not a lot of
complaint about that, and so what we're talking about here
is a significant punishment.

It's significant both under

this Court's cases, but also in Hawaii.

Hawaii considers

this to be an important punishment.
QUESTION:

Well, why wouldn't it suffice if we

held for those matters it's a denial of due process if the
States do not provide State court review of the prison
determinations?

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think that this Court's

2

cases, certainly the Perat line of cases seem to indicate

3

that when there's random and unauthorized State action,

4

that post deprivation remedies would be appropriate, but I

5

think that in a case where there's an established

6

procedure like this one, that's been in existence for more

7

than 20 years, that the issue is really what process is

8

due as part of this determination, not at some later point

in a State court hearing on damages.
