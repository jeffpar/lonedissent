ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MR. BARTEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Section 3124,

title 31 of the United States

15

Code, prohibits State taxation of Federal obligations and •

16

the interest thereon.

Federal obligations or the interest on Federal

obligations.

This prohibition extends to every

The Nebraska supreme court erred in holding that

3

Nebraska's tax violated section 3124.

4

Nebraska's tax did not consider directly or indirectly

5

either Federal obligations or interest on Federal

6

obligations.

the mutual funds which distributed income to Respondent

Loewenstein were in essence secured loans in which Federal

obligations merely served as collateral.

QUESTION:

Could you describe in perhaps a

11

little detail exactly what a typical agreement like this

12

was, and why it was entered into?

13

MR. BARTEL:

Repurchase agreements are called

14

repos for short, and they're in essence contracts

15

involving the simultaneous sale and future repurchase of

16

an asset, usually Treasury securities.

17

consist of what is a two-part transaction.

18

party that holds Federal securities, denominated as the

19

seller, transfers the securities to another party, the

20

buyer, in exchange for cash.

21

have been the mutual funds.

Repos generally
In step 1, the

In this case the buyer would

22

The second step consists of a contemporaneous

23

agreement by the seller to repurchase the securities at

24

the original sale price, plus an agreed-upon amount of

25

interest in a rate specified in the agreement.

QUESTION:

Not dependent on the rate that the

security pays?
MR. BARTEL:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

The interest paid by the seller is paid on prevailing

5

market rates on loans or financing transactions of similar

6

maturity and risk.

7

the interest paid by the seller on repurchase is less than

8

the interest rate accruing on the underlying obligations.

9

That was in the second stipulation, paragraph 19.

10

In fact, it was stipulated below that

QUESTION:

But you could say the same thing

11

about the normal sale of Treasury bonds, couldn't you?

12

you sell a bond that has a certain maturity price, and if,

13

in fact, rates for other obligations have gone up, the

14

money you get won't depend upon the face interest on the

15

Government obligation.

market is at the time, won't it?

MR. BARTEL:

It will depend upon what the

That is true.

Yes, that's correct,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And yet that transaction, you

acknowledge, is exempt from taxation, is it not?
MR. BARTEL:

Yes.

The distinction here, Your

22

Honor, is that the way the repurchase agreement is

23

structured, that the funds in essence are never, the owner

24

is entitled to the Federal exemption.

25

is interest at a rate agreed to between private parties

1

that really doesn't bear a relation to the interest rate,

2

and more importantly - QUESTION:

3

Yes, but I'm -- that factor is

4

irrelevant, once you acknowledge that in just a straight

5

sale of a Treasury bond, it -- the amount you pay for it

6

has nothing to do with the interest rate on the face of

7

the bond.

8

I don't see how that's a point for you at all, the fact

9

that the interest rate depends on market rate.

10

It has to do with what the going market is, so

MR. BARTEL:

It is in purposes of the overall

11

analyzation, I think, of the nature of the agreements,

12

because what we are contending, again, is that the real

13

substance, the true substance of the agreements is that

14

the mutual funds were not the true owners or substantive

15

owners of the underlying obligations.

16

QUESTION:

Well, what kind of unforeseen

17

consequences would result from our characterization of

18

this as a loan?

19

that is acquiring the bonds temporarily, then if it's the

20

owner there would be one consequence, if it was a loan

21

there would be another.

22

a loan for purposes of SEC regulation of the sales?

8

It's pointed out in the amicus briefs filed by

9

the Investment Company Institute and the Federal Reserve

10

Bank of New York that not all repos are identical to the

11

precise transactions involved in this case.

12

QUESTION:

Are there other instances where

13

something is characterized one way for bankruptcy

14

purposes, yet another way for security purposes, yet

15

another way for tax purposes?

16

extraordinary to have a different characterization for tax

17

purposes than for other purposes?

18
19
20

MR. BARTEL:

Is that -- is it

I would not think so, although I

don't have any ready examples.
I think the mere fact that when you look at

21

repos themselves and that there has been a division of the

22

characterization and treatment, depending upon the purpose

23

served, even the bankruptcy decisions, the Bevill case,

24

that discuss the characterization of repos for tax

25

purposes recognize that there may be different reasons why

1

a rule or a principle of construction should be adopted

2

for tax purposes that is different than the concerns in a

3

bankruptcy context.
And that, in essence, is why we think that the

4
5

economic substance principle, which has been recognized by

6

Federal courts, construing the exemption of repurchase

7

agreements involving cases construing section 103 of the

8

Internal Revenue Code, which deals with the exemption of

9

interest on State and local obligations, and State court

10

cases that have also relied on the economic substance

11

analysis to look at -QUESTION:

12

In the respondent's brief, the red

13

brief at about page -- it's at page 26 -- he sets forth a

14

hypothetical transaction where a $10,000 Treasury bill is

15

due in 360 days, and he has a series of hypotheticals, and

16

the first one, of course, is if the taxpayer just holds it

17

for 360 days, and he paid $9,500 for it, he redeems it for

18

$10,000, there's then $500 worth of interest, and all of

19

that is covered by the exemption.

20

that.

21

Everybody agrees with

Do you agree with his second example -- I take

22

it you do - - that if the bill is sold, just as an outright

23

sale, no repo agreement, just an outright sale, 180 days

24

down the road, that the exemption of $500 is given $250 to

25

each holder?

MR. BARTEL:

It appears in the hypothetical that

2

what he's dealing with is a short-term Treasury bill that

3

may be an obligation issued with discount.

4

extent that I believe that is the nature of the

5

hypothetical, that is correct, but we don't --

6

QUESTION:

That, to the

So that it's correct that if I own a

7

bill for 180 days, a 360-day bill, and I then transfer it

8

to a second holder, we each split the exemption?

9

MR. BARTEL:

I believe under the OID rules under

10

the Federal Income Tax Code there would be -- if you are

11

the actual holder and there is a transfer in substantive

12

owner, then that holder who is a substantive owner is

13

required to report that portion as income, that's correct.

14

QUESTION:

Well, and they each get the exemption

15

under Nebraska law, don't they?

16

MR. BARTEL:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
All right.

Now, when we get to the

18

repo transaction, do you agree with the characterization

19

he gives of how the repo transaction works?

20

MR. BARTEL:

No, we do not, Your Honor, because

21

we believe it, again as we explain in our brief, fails to

22

take into account the fact that the funds do not receive

23

exempt interest from the Federal Government.

QUESTION:

Well, under Nebraska law in the repo

MR. BARTEL:

Well, the effect of the add-back

21

provision could be to reduce the economic benefit.

22

would still receive a $500 exemption, but there may be a

23

requirement to add back, but we don't believe that that is

an impairment or a violation of section 3121.

that if you're wrong about 3124 and what it requires, it

That would be an application to the

It would not be an application -QUESTION:

7

What

Yes.

If the argument is that what

3124 requires is that every dollar of interest be fully
reflected, I suppose Nebraska could do that two ways.

10

way would be to say, Loewenstein gets the benefit.

11

Another way would be to say this person, whatever we

12

call -- the repoer, some briefs have called it, doesn't

13

have to add back the expense of the financing.
MR. BARTEL:

14

It's our position, of course, that

15

section 3124 doesn't require that result, and we would

16

rely on the Court's decision on First National Bank of

17

Atlanta v. Bartow County.

Because of the fact that repos can

As to how they do it, whether it's by judicial

there is even some inconsistency with some States saying

that they can tax all dividends from mutual fund

shareholders.

only looking at that portion which is derived from

12

repurchase agreements.

13

We haven't attempted to do that.

We're

So I don't know that other States have adopted

14

exactly the same test, but I think they're all urging the

15

Court, the amicus States, to look at economic substance as

16

the test to be applied.

QUESTION:

Very bravely I'm going to try this

again, since I'm thinking that it seems quite important in

my mind as to how the case comes out.

The repoer receives the interest on the Treasury

That is correct.
The repoer pays some money to the

MR. BARTEL:

Even if the transaction were

is not, if they are the owner and they are reselling the

obligation, wouldn't that in essence be gain on sale,

which the States have, I think, the authority to tax a

gain on sale of a Federal obligation.

So if they are -- it's clear from the agreements

that what they're bargaining for is not the interest from

However, the Nebraska Department of Revenue has

3

adopted an administrative ruling that essentially takes

4

away that exemption in the case of repurchase agreements.

5

That revenue ruling violates the applicable Federal

statute and the Supremacy Clause, and the Nebraska supreme

MR. WITTLER:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not

MR. WITTLER:

That's not what I mean to say,

we'd still have a problem with the Nebraska approach,

its obligations the same way, and you're saying it

MR. WITTLER:

I disagree with that, Your Honor.

14

There is nothing in the record, number 1, to answer that

question.

I don't know for a fact how they treat them.
What I know is that the Department of Revenue

apparently thought it necessary to adopt this regulation

to reach Federal repo income, and it has not seen fit to

adopt a similar regulation to allow it to meet State of

ruling that addresses Federal, none that addresses State,

QUESTION:

You know, Mr. Wittier,

it seems to me

that we dealt with an aspect of this argument in the

Bartow County Board of Tax Assessors case, where the Court-

16

said that the tax exemption required by the Constitution

17

and section 3124 is not a tax shelter, and Federal

18

obligations may be acquired in part by liabilities, and

19

when they are, a pro rata method of allocating a fair

20

share to the liabilities doesn't infringe on the immunity.

21

counter to what the Court said in Bartow --

1

provision was established by the Court's decision in First

2

National Bank of Atlanta v. Bartow County, and if that is

3

the only argument that they have to present, we think that

4

the Court can certainly reverse the decision of the court

5

below.
QUESTION:

6

I have just one question about why

7

Nebraska is not taking the position that California and

8

some other States have taken that all of this is beside

9

the point, because what Loewenstein receives is simply a

10

taxable dividend from the mutual fund.

11

MR. BARTEL:

Of course, that's largely a policy

12

question.

13

the cases, I suppose, from the other States, saw that the

14

trend was to allow the pass-through of interest income

15

earned by direct ownership of Federal obligations.

16

Our Department of Revenue simply, in looking at

We have not raised the issue, but I assume it's

17

based on the trend in those decisions, but, of course, our

18

position isn't binding on what other States may attempt.

24

There's been no decision, obviously, by this
Court on that question.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Bartel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
