CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 94-325, Chandris v. Latsis.
Mr. McCreadie.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McCREADIE:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the common and troublesome

10
11

question of who is a seaman under the Jones Act.

12

Unfortunately, the Jones Act does not define the statutory

13

term, seaman, so that task is left to the courts.

14

Court has struggled with that issue over the years, as

15

have the circuit and district courts.

This

16

Traditionally, the test that has been used, even

17

if it has more than two parts, breaks the seaman test down

18

into the examination of the connection of the employee to

19

his employer, or the vessel and then, secondly, the

20

employee's contribution to the vessel itself.

21

In Wilander, this Court addressed the second

22

part of that test, and answered the question of whether a

23

seaman must contribute to the navigation of the vessel

24

and, of course, the holding was that that is not

25

necessary.

The seaman must merely contribute to the

1

function or contribute to the mission of the vessel.
The issue today addresses the first question,

2

3

and that is, what is the employment-related connection to

4

the vessel that is necessary?
Wilander, although it addressed the navigation

5
6

issue, did make statements and give clues as to what

7

employment-related connection is necessary.

8

important - QUESTION:

9

One

Well, but I think what it didn't do

10

was answer the question whether the employee's

11

contribution has to be simply substantial, or a more

12

permanent one, in effect, with regard to his maritime

13

employment.

14
15
16

MR. McCREADIE:

That issue was certainly left

open.
QUESTION:

Yes, it was, and the Fifth Circuit

17

seems to have a more restrictive test, pointing, perhaps,

18

to permanent employment in that capacity, and the Second

19

Circuit spoke in terms of a substantial contribution in

20

terms of duration or nature.

21
22

23
24
25

MR. McCREADIE:

And I think that that focuses us

squarely on the issue today.
QUESTION:

And what test do you say this Court

must adopt?
MR. McCREADIE:

Well, in analyzing, Justice

O'Connor, those two tests, I believe that although there

2

were some good intentions in the Latsis test, there are

3

two fatal flaws in that test, and therefore I advocate the

4

Fifth Circuit test which has withstood many, many years of

5

tests under fire, under battle.
QUESTION:

6

7

with the Second Circuit's articulation of the test?
MR. McCREADIE:

8

9

What do you say are the fatal flaws

The Latsis test -- the problem

with the Latsis test is that we do know from Wilander that

10

Longshoreman and Jones Act seamen are mutually exclusive.

11

We also -QUESTION:

12

Do you think Mr. Latsis could have

13

been covered under the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers'

14

Act for these injuries?

15

MR. McCREADIE:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Did --to your knowledge, does the

17

record disclose whether he ever made an application under

18

that act?

19

MR. McCREADIE:

The record does not disclose

20

whether Mr. Latsis made an application.

21

record, if may, Mr. Justice, there is no indication that

22

he has done so.

23

Going outside the

I have, in anticipation of that question, tried

24

to determine without unduly getting off the track to

25

determine whether he still has that remedy, and my

1

preliminary research is that under 33 U.S. 13(g), I

2

believe it is, there is a tolling section that would allow

3

him to proceed that remedy if he's unsuccessful as this

4

case runs through the courts.

5

QUESTION:

6

7

Are engineers treated as

longshoremen?
MR. McCREADIE:

Traditional crew members who

8

hold the position of engineers are not treated as

9

longshoremen.

10
11
12

13

They are permanently assigned to a vessel,

and therefore, under any tests -QUESTION:

No, but even a land-based engineer;

would a land-based engineer be a longshoreman?
MR. McCREADIE:

A land-based engineer who was

14

performing ship repairs would be a longshoreman under the

15

Fifth Circuit Robinson test, and in my view the correct

16

test, because he's going to split time between shore and

17

sea, and depending on how much time he spends at sea and

18

how much time at shore, he could be a longshoreman.

19

of those questions, of course, are for the jury to decide,

20

and this Court has been unequivocal also in that

21

statement, that seaman status, unless it's so clear --

22

QUESTION:

But is it not true that there are a

23

category of personnel who are neither seamen nor

24

longshoremen who might go to sea once in a while?

25

Most

MR. McCREADIE:

There is that category, and in

1

that case they are entitled to traditional negligence

2

remedies, but here, because he is performing ship repair,

3

or species of ship repair, I believe he is covered by the

4

Longshore Act.

5

QUESTION:

Well, is that technically correct to

6

say he was -- I mean, he wasn't getting down there and

7

soldering any wires himself, was he?

8

MR. McCREADIE:

9

QUESTION:

10

There --

He was a supervising engineer.

MR. McCREADIE:

To my knowledge there are no

11

Supreme Court cases that specifically define what a repair

12

is for the purposes of the Longshore Act or the Jones Act.

13

However, there are some circuit cases, and my

14

interpretation of those cases is that it's a fairly common

15

sense definition, and that if a person is utilizing his

16

talents to replace communication equipment, or shore up

17

communication equipment, or to fix engine problems or

18

consult on engine problems, that that person then would be

19

doing repairs.

20

QUESTION:

You mean, he can work in a skyscraper

21

in Manhattan - - I guess the individual here worked in New

22

York most of the time.

23

MR. McCREADIE:

Is that - - am I right about that?
He -- his residence was in New

24

York, but he spent most of his living time in Miami,

25

Florida, in the company offices and in a condominium that

QUESTION:

But if you had the right computer

3

hookup, you could really be in Manhattan in a high rise

4

office building and still be a longshoreman.

5

MR. McCREADIE:

QUESTION:

7

MR. McCREADIE:

That's correct.

Virtual reality.
Under that circumstance, I think

8

to correct myself, he would not be a longshoreman, because

9

to be a longshoreman you need to satisfy the situs and the

10

status test, and although he would satisfy the status

11

test, he would not satisfy the situs test, so I stand

12

corrected on that answer.

13

QUESTION:

That --

Even though there may be difficult

14

cases, is there a possibility here to at least carve out a

15

category of easy cases, and that is, if we assume that the

16

individual is employed by the vessel owner, that the

17

vessel is on a voyage, which I take it this one

18

indisputably was, that the person is supposed to do some

19

work for the vessel owner on the voyage -- he's not a

20

passenger, and he's not a stowaway -- would we get into

21

trouble in carving out a central category in that case

22

when all those conditions are met, and say anyone in that

23

capacity is a seaman for purposes of that voyage?

your question correctly, you're reviewing the elements of

the voyage test, which would cover the situation that

2

you've described, and I believe not only would you create

3

difficulties, I think you would open the floodgates to

4

more and more litigation over this issue, and more

QUESTION:

Well, would we open floodgates to

7

more litigation over the issue, or just open floodgates to

8

more claimants who would succeed on their claims?

there a difference?

I think both would occur.

Longshore Act would be vitiated by that test.

QUESTION:

To give you

Well, before you get to the example,

15

I'm not following the discussion, because I had been under

16

the impression that you can't be a long --a seaman for

17

purposes of the voyage, that it is an employment status;

18

that you are either a seaman, or you are not a seaman.

19

And if you are a seaman, and have made one voyage, that

20

makes you a seaman.

You remain a seaman when you're back

MR. McCREADIE:

And if you get injured in the office

The reason why the voyage test

19

is wrong is, it has absolutely no resolving power, and the

examples of who would qualify under that test, you can go

21

on and on and on, and in fact the justice of this Court --

MR. McCREADIE:

1

Well, the voyage test does not

comply with the requirements that were set down in

Wilander, and the voyage test certainly would not be

If the

1

ABA or another bar group chartered a vessel and they

2

operated the vessel, and there was a seminar on board, and

3

one or more of the Court was invited to be a speaker on

4

that cruise, that voyage, and there was an injury to one

5

of the justices, the simplistic elements of the voyage

6

test would be met, because the justice would be

7

contributing to the mission of the vessel -- i.e., giving

8

an educational seminar, like an entertainer on a cruise

ship, you would be hurt during the voyage, and it would be

for the duration of the voyage.
QUESTION:

But you wouldn't be employed by the

vessel.
MR. McCREADIE:

But the voyage test does not

merits, that there be an employment relationship between

would not exclude the example of the general counsel of

QUESTION:

But those are all clearly examples of

people who would not be longshoremen, I assume.
MR. McCREADIE:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

So we do have a category of people

who are neither longshoremen or seamen.

12

MR. McCREADIE:

13

QUESTION:

There certainly are.

I take it the situs of the injury,

14

the fact that it occurred on a voyage, is relevant, is one

15

of the factors?

16

MR. McCREADIE:

In the Latsis case itself, the

17

Longshore Act in my view does cover the situation, because

18

he was a ship repairman.

19

general counsel, the CEO, and an in-house marketing

20

person, they do not fall within the category of the

21

Longshore Act.

But if you're a seaman, and the

1

MR. McCREADIE:

Absolutely correct, and that is

2

because the seaman status is not established at the exact

3

time of the accident, or -- and what you're doing

4

immediately before the accident.

5

In seaman's cases, this Court over and over has

6

decided that it doesn't want seamen to walk in and out of

7

coverage, so you looked to the overall employment

8

relationship, decided what status the person was, and

9

whether they were on shore or on a ship, they're entitled

10
11

to seamen's remedies.
QUESTION:

But in a close case, where the

12

claimant is arguing for seaman's status, is it relevant

13

that the injury occurred on the vessel on a voyage?

14

That's where Justice Souter was leading.

15

It seems to me there may be a category of easier

16

cases, and we can say that in a close case this can be the

17

dispositive factor.

18

subject to the perils of the sea, he's got to do what the

19

ship's doctor says, et cetera, et cetera.

It occurred on the voyage, where he's

MR. McCREADIE:

That is certainly a complicating

21

factor, and it makes it more difficult for us just to

22

exclude that person.

23

how using just a voyage test creates problems.

your answer to Justice Kennedy has to be no, that it is

irrelevant where the injury happened to occur.

The

Now, it may tug at the heartstrings, and it may

4
5

be a - - you know, an emotionally significant factor, but

6

as I understand your theory, the question is whether the

7

individual is normally doing the work of a seaman, and if

8

not, even if he happens to have been injured at sea,

9

during a voyage, it should make no difference.
MR. McCREADIE:

And I agree with your summary.

Perhaps I misunderstood your question.

test to apply, and from that perspective, I thought that

it is complicating, but it's not --

QUESTION:

It does not fit
It does have

But it seems to me not only

17

intuitive, but it has some bearing on the rationale for

18

the act, which is that the seaman is subject to the

19

discipline of the ship, the orders of the ship's doctor,

20

et cetera, which is precisely why we have seaman's status

21

at all.
MR. McCREADIE:

The perils of the sea is

certainly one of the policy considerations in protecting

seamen.

QUESTION:

1

2

Well, I'm suggesting that it is a

weighty factor, not the sole factor.
MR. McCREADIE:

3

It is one of the factors

4

involved, but, for example, as we discussed earlier,

5

seamen who are on shore are no longer subjected to the

6

perils of the sea, and -QUESTION:

7

Mr. McCreadie, I thought I had your

8

position right, but from what you're saying now, I'm not

clear.

I thought your position is you could type every

person, every employee.

11

say, tell me what Latsis' work is, and I will tell you

12

whether he's a seaman or not.

MR. McCREADIE:

14

QUESTION:

Before the accident occurs, you

That is correct.

So that, in answer to Justice

15

Kennedy's question, on your theory it should be irrelevant

16

whether Latsis was injured in a sea storm, because you

know from day 1, based on the obligations and duties of

18

his job, that he will not be a sailor.

19

your position.

20

MR. McCREADIE:

I thought that was

That is my position, and I

21

probably confused it by, again, conceding that there are

some advocates who want to just look to the place of the

injury to determine whether someone is a seaman.

My position is that you cannot

use perils of the sea as the sole basis for your test.

9

You have to start with Wilander, and use an employment-

10

related connection to a vessel.

11

The only place that the perils of the sea comes

12

into play is, when you're trying to draw the fine line at

the very end of the test, I think it's relevant to

This case

MR. McCREADIE:

The difficulty is, and the

2

reason that that is a problem, is because, as this Court

3

has pointed out, the Court has to give the law, and the

4

jury has to make the decision, and what I'm trying to

5

explain is that there are situations that superficially

6

fall under the Robinson-Barrett test, and makes a

7

longshoreman into a seaman, and that is contrary to

8

Congress' intent as to what they want to occur.

9

And what I'm trying to explain in the fourth

10

part of my brief on the merits is that, in order to

11

fortify the Fifth Circuit test, to shore it up so that it

12

is more precise, so that it does help a jury reach a

13

realistic and honest appraisal of the seaman's status and

14

also help an employer know what his employees are, that

15

conceptually it is fair to shore that up by adding in that

16

you need either a permanent connection, or a substantial

17

connection, as long as the substantial prong is fortified

18

by exposure, the perils at sea, not at the dock, or to the

dangers of vessels while they're underway at sea.

they're covered all the time.

MR. McCREADIE:

The difference between the tests

20

are that the perils of the sea is mentioned in the Latsis

21

test, but when they use the term, regularly exposed to the

22

perils of the sea, they did not address or use the word

can be up to 90 percent, according to the facts in this

And you take issue with that, is that

where you differ?
MR. McCREADIE:

That is the main problem.

That

is a problem with the test itself, because it allows

11

shore-based employees, contrary to Wilander, to be seamen.

12

I also take exception with the fact that they

articulate, regularly exposed to the perils of the sea,

but they never used it and never applied it to the facts

15

of the case, because if a person who is only out there

I can see there would be something wrong

with covering him once he comes back to shore, but is

there anything wrong with covering him while he's at sea?
MR. McCREADIE:

That would be tantamount to the

covering an employee just because he goes on one voyage.

You have to look to his entire employment-related

that while he's on the shore and doing the welding at the

MR. McCREADIE:

Because this Court and Congress

have shown a disinclination to allow people to wander in

10

QUESTION:

Well, is part of the problem that the

evolution of the Jones Act which was cited in the Wilander

case, and those are the Senko cases and the Butler case.
QUESTION:

3
4

Those are rather extreme decisions,

though, some 30 years ago, weren't they?
MR. ROSENBERG:

5

Well, I would not characterize

them as extreme, because they've been guiding courts all

7

along since that time, in terms of coverage, but just

8

let's examine factually what Butler involved and see how

9

it fits in with the situation at hand.

10

In Butler, there was a tugboat that had not been

11

moved in the year in question, except when it was towed to

12

a drydock.

13

It was awaiting Coast Guard inspection, it had no captain,

14

it had no other crew members except a laborer who was

15

assigned to it, and the laborer was mysteriously found

16

drowned, and the assumption was that he had somehow fallen

17

from a gangplank.

It was, I guess, effectively decommissioned.

18

Now, that vessel, this Court held, that question

19

as to whether that vessel was or was not in navigation was

20

a question for a jury, in the same way that the Second

21

Circuit held that whether or not that drydock, 6 months,

22

with very close planning, which had a crew on board, where

23

Mr. Latsis was, I contend, one of the crew members on that

boat, on that ship for that period of time, they executed

a plan where they restored that vessel in 6 months and she

I don't think that was a casual observation that was made.

Act.
And it's clearly contemplated that -- for

2

3

instance, in enumerating all the occupations and trades

4

that historically have been considered as seamen before

5

the Jones Act was enacted, and that was the starting point

6

for the analysis in Wilander, there have been engineers,

7

to have contributed to the mission of a voyage or the

function of the vessel, and those alternatives were

incorporated into -- in the -- universally in all the

QUESTION:

Could he be a longshoreman if he was

Don't think so.

No, it wouldn't, no.

So --

MR. ROSENBERG:

And in his office he wouldn't

meet it, either.
QUESTION:

So isn't it true that a lot of people

13

who are at sea -- this is following up on Justice Souter's

14

approach -- would not meet the situs test under the

15

Longshoreman's Act.

16

MR. ROSENBERG:

That's true, yes, and as a

17

matter of fact, there is a case that was not mentioned so

18

far, a recent case of this Court, Gizoni, a ship

19

repairman, where the employer advocated that since he was

20

a ship repairman, how could he be a seaman?

21

Well, this Court found Mr. Gizoni, a ship

22

repairman, a seaman because he traveled on work platforms

23

that were floating, and therefore the vessel requirement

24

was met, even though it was several vessels.

1

that you cannot go in and out of seaman and longshore

2

status?

3

MR. ROSENBERG:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, I do.

Well, that's exactly what I wondered

5

in the Second Circuit test.

6

about a person, other things being satisfied, that he

7

either - - he makes a contribution that is substantial

8

either in respect to duration, or nature.
MR. ROSENBERG:

9

QUESTION:

10

That is to say, they talk

Correct.

So I'm thinking, what about our

11

welder?

Ninety-nine percent of his time he's at the dock.

12

One day, he's repairing the bulkhead and they say, come

13

with us, continue to do it while we go to Hamburg.

14

Now, reading that test, I thought it would cover

15

him while he is making a substantial contribution in terms

16

of nature, though not of time.

17

MR. ROSENBERG:

18

QUESTION:

Exactly.

And therefore he would be covered.

19

But when he got back to the shore, and he got off the

20

boat, and he went back to his normal welding facilities,

21

he's no longer covered, while, on the other hand, the

22

seaman, who's there because of duration, i.e., the real

23

sailor, is covered always.

24
25

Now, that's how I was reading that, and that's
why I started out with Justice Souter's idea.

Perhaps

that would work.

as to whether that works or doesn't work.

4

But now from various -- I'm quite shaken

QUESTION:

I don't think that's what the Second

Circuit is saying.

5

QUESTION:

Well, regardless --

6

MR. ROSENBERG:

They didn't address that, no,

7

but let me tell you that there is a case in this Court

8

that was decided in 1959, Braen v. Pfeifer, which is cited

9

in the reply brief --we didn't cite it in our brief, but

10

it's in the reply brief, which involved a -- the question

11

as to whether you could step out of seaman status.

12

And this was a - - this was someone who was a

13

seaman, and he was assigned to nonseaman duties, and the

14

question was, by that assignment, would that take him out

15

of seaman status, and the holding was that it was not, and

16

I think implicit in that holding, and this also I think is

17

also the rationale of Senko, was the fact that it was an

18

intention that he would return at some point, that he was

19

destined to once again encounter the hazards of the sea,

20

and therefore he retains that seaman status.

21

QUESTION:

So how could we do that?

What I'm

22

basically getting at is, I don't understand why the welder

23

shouldn't be covered when he's out there in the ocean.

24

MR. ROSENBERG:

I think he should be.

But I can perfectly well understand

So how does it work, this statute, to

get there?
MR. ROSENBERG:

If the -- if your hypothetical

12

welder, Your Honor, did an odd job at sea, so he wasn't

13

regularly -- that wasn't part of his regular employment,

14

that was extraordinary.

15

was substantial, he would become a seaman.

16

Then if the welding job at hand

When he went back, however, if -- in proving

17

that it was isolated, did not ever encounter that kind of

18

risk or job again, or was not intended to, nobody planned

19

him doing that, then in effect his job changed, and he

20

lost the seaman status because he's no longer --

21

QUESTION:

Well, the Second Circuit test would

22

not cover the welder who was asked to go to Hamburg,

23

because it clearly said, you also have to find that in the

course of the plaintiff's employment, the plaintiff is

25

regularly exposed to the hazards of the sea.

You both agree that it has to be regularly, that

2

the individual does not occupy seaman status unless he's

3

regularly at sea, is that right?
MR. ROSENBERG:

4

Well, we're obliged to do that

5

because that's what the Second Circuit said, and we're

6

supporting the Second Circuit.

7

regularly has not been defined in any -- to any degree,

8

and I think contextually the - - regularly in that

9

situation means not sporadically, not spasmodically.

However, that term

Not related to the clock, however, because that

10

was the one thing that the Second Circuit was clear in

rejecting, that having a time-only index --

Mr. Rosenberg, we're talking about a

MR. ROSENBERG:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Judge Oaks wrote a charge for that

17

jury.

18

but what she says, it wasn't plain error.

Judge Kearse agreed that's a perfectly fine charge,

19

MR. ROSENBERG:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

So either the Fifth Circuit words are

21

right, permanent, or the Second Circuit's words are right,

22

substantial -- what is it? -- but more refinements we

23

can't give, because what we're talking about is, what was

24

the correct charge --

25

MR. ROSENBERG:

Exactly.

QUESTION:

1

-- for a jury to be given, in the

2

words of the Fifth Circuit, or in the words of the Second

3

Circuit?

4

MR. ROSENBERG:

5

QUESTION:

Exactly.

And nothing more elaborate is going

6

to help this district judge, who is either going to be

7

finished with the case, if the district judge is right, or

8

we'll have to charge another jury, if we uphold the Second

9

Circuit's decision.

10

MR. ROSENBERG:

Except, of course, that other

11

point I brought up, Your Honor, that in addition, Judge

12

Oaks' opinion states it was error to have excluded from

13

the jury's consideration the period of time the vessel was

14

in drydock from their determination whether Mr. Latsis, in

15

his overall employment, had a substantial connection to

16

that vessel.

17

The Second Circuit held that error, and that

18

ruling has not been challenged here, so in effect the

19

choices I see before the Court are, as you pointed out,

20

Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit test or the Second Circuit

21

test, but in any event a remand and a new trial, and that

22

seems inevitable on the state of this record.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

You say there should be a new trial

even though we were to adopt the Fifth Circuit test?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

But the Fifth Circuit test was not always so

1

2

time-oriented.

3

case, the Fifth Circuit was not so narrowly construing

4

that test.

5

relatively speaking, in recent times, and the older Fifth

6

Circuit test, where that emphasis of time was not so

7

narrow, is very much the same, except I think in the

8

Second Circuit it's more well articulated, to get away

9

from that concept, and I think that that --

duration as one way of proving substantiality, and nature

15

the other way, and if the nature of his work during the

voyage was what every seaman does -- maybe they just send

QUESTION:

The Second Circuit clearly had an

additional requirement, in addition to, that it be

The Second Circuit also said

10

that the plaintiff's employment had to regularly expose

11

the plaintiff to the hazards of the sea.

12

MR. ROSENBERG:

13

QUESTION:

14

So the Second Circuit had an

additional requirement.

15

MR. ROSENBERG:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes.

Exactly, Your Honor.

And the welder on a one-time trip

would not be covered under that test.
MR. ROSENBERG:

Assuming a trip was finite, it

19

wasn't a long, you know, worldwide cruise kind of thing,

20

he would or wouldn't be covered under that test, but you

21

have to employ that term to ascertain whether or not that

22

requirement was made, that fourth requirement.

23

QUESTION:

Is it possible to read the Second

24

Circuit test and to answer Justice Breyer's question in

25

some such way as this:

once a person has attained seaman status, he doesn't lose

2

that status by going ashore for a month or something of

3

that sort, he doesn't become a nonseaman when he crosses

4

the gangplank, and we will assume that when someone does

5

not have seaman status, mere presence fora short time,

6

perhaps even as an employee on the ship, may not be

7

enough.

8

9

But there are some cases, and perhaps this is
one, in which, by -- in which the previously nonseaman

10

goes on a voyage and performs duties which in fact

11

indicate a change in his job, and when that happens, as it

12

might be if the welder went to sea and while they were at

13

sea somebody said, my God, there's a leak in the hull, can

14

you weld it shut, and he goes down, of course he's

15

contributing to the mission of the ship, et cetera.

16

In that case, he is simply performing a

17

different kind of job for his employer from what he does

18

when he sits in drydock and so on, and this may be one of

19

those cases, and the Second Circuit's test is consistent

20

with applying -- may consistently be applied to find

21

seaman status, because once the job has changed, he

regularly is performing those duties.

Right.

He's assigned to land for 2 months,

he remains, he's ever and always a sailor.
Now, you seem to be shuffling on whether

spends a considerable amount of time on a voyage, can be,

for that temporary time, a sailor, even though he's going

to go back on shore and be an engineer and sit in his

office in Miami, and maybe fall down the stairs there.

Is Latsis ever and always a sailor, or can he be

a sailor, under your argument, when he's in the middle of

the ocean on the way to Bermuda, and yet not be a sailor

when he gets back to his office in Miami and falls down

the stairs?

MR. ROSENBERG:

1

Traditionally, it has been that

2

once you achieve the status of seaman, you don't step out

3

of it, as long as that continuity of the duties related to

4

that employment continue, but people do change jobs.
QUESTION:

But his job hasn't changed.

He

occasionally goes on ships, but he spends most of his time

on land.

as either a sailor or not so that just as when he had the

Are you -- is your answer yes, you must type him

got it in his office in Miami, when he got back, he would

11

still be a sailor?
MR. ROSENBERG:

12

Oh, he'd still be a sailor, yes,

13

but there's no negligence of an employer in the office in

14

Miami, so he would --

15

QUESTION:

I'm assuming that the office is ill-

eguipped, or the stairs in the property that was rented by

the employer were defected, so the negligence is still

there.
