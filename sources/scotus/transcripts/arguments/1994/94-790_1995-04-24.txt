MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Section 3585 of title

8 instructs the Bureau of

Prisons to calculate a defendant's sentence of

3

imprisonment in two related steps.

4

the Bureau must first determine when the sentence began,

5

which usually is when the defendant is received for

6

transportation to the facility where he is to serve it.

7

Under subsection (a),

Subsection (b) of the statute deals with the

8

issue of credit for prior custody before the sentence

9

began, and it generally requires that a defendant receive

20

credit for any time he has spent "in official detention."

21

The issue in this case is whether the Bureau is

22

correct in denying sentence credit under subsection (b) to

23

defendants who are released on bail within the meaning of

24

the Bail Reform Act of

status?
MR. ESTRADA:

Bail status.

After the judgment

10

of the court of appeals, the judgment I think in the last

11

footnote of the court's opinion instructed the district

12

court to grant bail to the defendant pending any hearing

13

on the remand on just how jail-like the conditions of

14

incarceration or of bail were.

MR. ESTRADA:

QUESTION:

19

MR. ESTRADA:

He would --

Would he have more time to serve?
Yes, he would.

Yes, he would.

20

The supposition of the court of appeals is that because

21

the sentence that remained was so short, and practically

22

most of it was subject to the dispute of credit, that in

23

order not to render the case moot pending the hearing that

24

the court ordered, the defendant should be granted bail,

25

and that's what the district court did on remand, and if

we manage to persuade the Court to our view of the statute

2

in this case, the result will be that he will have to

3

surrender for custody and serve the remainder of the

4

sentence.

5

The Third Circuit in this case rejected the

6

Bureau's interpretation and held that the words "official

7

detention" must be read more broadly than the Bureau does

8

in order to include a court order that releases a

9

defendant in bail but subject to a condition that he

10

remains in a privately run halfway house under the

11

conditions that the court termed "jail-like," and our

12

argument in this Court has three principal points as to

13

why the court of appeals was wrong.

14

First, that the context of the statutory

15

language indicates that Congress used the word "detention"

16

as an antonym of "bail," so that a defendant who receives

17

bail under any conditions should not be eligible for

18

credit under subsection (b).

19

The second point that I'd like to make today is

20

that Congress used the words "official detention" in the

21

statute for the first time in 1984, and that it was by

22

then settled in the courts of appeals under the antecedent

23

statute that dealt with credit that somebody who was

24

released on bail would not be eligible for credit toward a

25

sentence of imprisonment, and the third joint is that

1

if -- even if the court of appeals is right that it is

2

possible to read the statute more broadly, the agency was

3

not required to do so, and its view is reasonable, so it

4

is entitled to deference.
QUESTION:

8

Did the Bureau of Prisons have a

MR. ESTRADA:

979 program statement?

The contention is that it did.

Our view is they did not -- that it did not.

9

There was a general rule that would have denied

10

a defendant in the position of respondent credit even

11

under the old policy.statement, and in fact that general

12

rule was cited by the warden when it turned down the first

3

request by the inmate in this case.

4

There was an exception that came out of a case

5

called Waldorf, as we discuss in our brief, that was

6

basically to the effect that if the defendant was ordered

7

to actually be in a jail as a condition of bail under the

8

custody of prison officials, credit would be granted in

9

these circumstances.

Well, the use -- the policy

might be interpreted.
I haven't heard respondent offer an example as

2

3

to any other time in which it was interpreted that broadly

4

and, in fact, if it were, it would be inconsistent with

5

the general thrust of the general rule, because if it were

6

as broad as the court of appeals thought, it would swallow

the entire rule that said that this class of people didn't

get credit, and -QUESTION:

The facts that gave rise to the

That's right, because the statute

the sentence starts, not when the sentence is imposed, and

under subsection (a), the sentence starts when usually he

If I could go back to make one final point in

17

response to Justice O'Connor's question, the 1979 program

18

statement that does contain the exception was republished

19

in 1993 virtually in identical form, except that the 1993

20

version does not state that exception.

21

QUESTION:

Was there any statutory basis for

22

that change, or was it just a decision of the Bureau of

23

Prisons to change the language?

24

MR. ESTRADA:

25

There is no record as to why, when

the Bureau republished the 1993 version, it took out the

old Waldorf exception.
QUESTION:

Does the Bureau of Prisons have

rulemaking authority?

4

MR. ESTRADA:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

Not as to these matters.

Then what deference do we owe to the

Bureau of Prison's interpretation, do you think?
MR. ESTRADA:

Well, the same deference that you

8

would owe to any other agency's reasonable interpretation

9

of a statute that you have found it is charged with

10

administering.

Once you have held under Wilson, in our

11

view, that this statute was something that Congress

12

envisioned would be administered by the Bureau within the

13

narrow confines of what it is, they would get, in effect,

14

the delegated implicit authority to fill out the details

15

as to how better to make the statute work.

16

It is obviously a basic premise of that argument

17

that the court in Wilson found that Congress had an intent

18

to delegate to the Bureau these sorts of computations.

19

Obviously, if this were a statute the administration of

20

which is confined solely to the courts like any other

21

criminal statute, that is not an argument that we would be

22

making here, but once the court ruled in Wilson that there

23

was to some extent at least an .implicit delegation to the

24

Bureau to administer this statute, in our view they're

25

entitled to deference on their reasonable views as to what

the constitutional requirements that apply to a State's

MR. ESTRADA:

1

The result is that person gets no

credit, because if the person is not in that house, as I

3

understand your hypothetical, under the custody and under

may do to him many of the things that are done to both

that exactly happens, just what I said.
MR. ESTRADA:

12

I think I understand your

13

hypothetical, Justice Breyer, and the answer is that under

14

our view of the statute the word "detention" connotes --

15

the word "detention" as used in the credit statute

16

connotes custody by State prison authorities, the old bars

1

got those rather restrictive bail conditions and -- yes,

2

well, tell me if he knew first, and then I would like to

3

ask if he didn't know, wasn't he entitled to notice?

4

MR. ESTRADA:

Let me take that in two answers.

5

As to the first point, the answer is, we don't know,

6

because all of the records from the original case in

7

Baltimore are sealed, so what was actually placed on the

8

record is not in front of the Court, and it is not in the

9

record in front of the Court.

10

Nonetheless, my answer to that is that by the

11

time this happened the issue of whether somebody could get

12

credit for time spent in a halfway house had been

13

litigated in the circuits, the Bureau had a policy, both

14

of those things had clear rules, and certainly that gives

15

better notice to a person who thinks that he should be

16

entitled to it than the rule that the Third Circuit came

17

up in this case, which basically says that if it later

18

should turn out that the person was held under jail-type

19

conditions, then maybe, depending on the outcome of a

20

hearing, he'll get credit.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, this is my concern.

You

22

say that the Bureau had a policy, and there's a statute

23

that could be interpreted in one way or another, but the

24

rules are so careful, Rule 11, to say when somebody makes

25

a plea, that the judge with meticulous care had to tell

2

all the consequences of that.
Now here, if a man is in a jail and then gets

3

transferred to this halfway house where he's allowed out

4

only once in 150 days, the notion that he would appreciate

5

that that is not the kind of detention for which he'll get

6

credit, there's this tremendous change, maybe he would

have said if that's the deal, I want to stay in jail.

QUESTION:

Well, I was going to ask,

13

Mr. Estrada, under at least the Federal system, is it open

14

to the prisoner to say that he wants to start serving his

15

time immediately in a detention facility?

16

MR. ESTRADA:

It is open to the prisoner to

17

waive his right to bail, and the court of appeals in

18

making the notice argument that Justice Ginsburg was just

19

referring to in effect said that.

20

QUESTION:

don't have room for you in the jail, we're going to put

you in a concrete house at 14th Street, where you're not

6

that bear on what may later follow from the bail

determination, it is important to emphasize that under the

8

bail statute there is a right to appellate review, and if

someone is dissatisfied with the conditions under which he

has placed, he can take them up and say that, for example,

11

they are too restrictive. I --

assume it would be where there's a short sentence, that if

is bound by that?

judge will give him his way.

other things where people would like to do something that

is not quite compelled by law, we will try to accommodate

him, but I don't think there's any legal rule, if there

are good reasons to the contrary, why he must have his way

QUESTION:

Could I ask you, before you go back

2

to that, Mr. Estrada, I want to follow up on Justice

3

Breyer's question.

4

Having the facts of this case in mind,

5

supposing -- I've got two alternatives.

Supposing the

6

defendant asks for bail, and in one case the judge says,

7

bail is granted on the conditions set forth here; in the

8

second case, the judge says bail is denied, and until --

9

for the present you will be confined in exactly the same

10

way, have the rest of the order be exactly the same, would

11

they require different results?

12

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, but let me explain that as to

13

the second hypothetical, the legal consequence under the

14

bail statute of the court saying bail is denied is that he

15

must be confined into the custody of the Attorney General,

16

so therefore the Court doesn't really have the authority

17

under the bail statute, I don't think, to sort of say,

18

bail is denied, and I'm going --

19

QUESTION:

Well, say he does it --

20

MR. ESTRADA:

21

QUESTION:

-- to confine you --

-- confined to the custody of the

22

Attorney General, and that custody shall be carried out in

23

the following manner.

You don't think he could do that.

24

MR. ESTRADA:

25

QUESTION:

No, I don't think he can do that.

But what if the Attorney General then

I gather, then, in both cases there's

General makes the decision.

MR. ESTRADA:

10

It's not official detention

In both cases there is detention

11

in some sense of the English word,

12

the latter case is there official detention within the

13

meaning of the statute.

It's official if the Attorney General

orders it; it's not if the court orders it.

16

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, in essence, yes, but let me

17

make two points in response to that, Justice Stevens,

18

because I agree with you that it is a troubling

19

hypothetical.
The first one is that Congress passes a statute

20
21

like the credit statute with reference to classes of

22

people.

23

really think of a case that comes close to a line in some

24

sense, but that wasn't the class that Congress didn't

25

think of favoring when it conceived of the broad class at

the outset.

2

The second point is that, as we point out in our

reply brief, being in the custody of the Attorney General,

even if she chooses to put you in a halfway house for some

period of time,

too.

That would still be

I don't -- it seems to me

3

that if the Court found that the defendant should be

detained, which is a finding that under the bail law may

20

to find out what surveillance, what a person would do if

might want the person to wander around.

There are situations in which you

4

hypothesized, our basic point continues to be the same,

5

that the statute deals with,categories of what readily

came to Congress' mind as the classes most likely to be

implicated by rulings of this type.
QUESTION:

Well, what language of the statute do

you rely on in giving credit for time spent in State

custody?

11

But even as to cases that can be

There's no reference there to the Attorney

MR. ESTRADA:

Once again, let me make the first

13

answer to that question by emphasizing the answer that I

14

gave to Justice Breyer, which is that it is not our

15

contention that the credit statute incorporates in high

16

verba the definitions of the Bail Reform Act.

17

in the context of a statute of this type, the word

18

"detention" has a plain meaning that connotes a denial of

19

bail, and that an example of that is the Bail Reform Act.

20

Even if it were our contention that the statute

It is that

21

simply incorporates the related statutes so that we were

22

faced with the notion of this being limited only to the

23

Attorney General, the Bureau has taken the view that it

24

can extend that a little bit based on the legislative

25

history of the '66 act which we mentioned in our reply

1

brief, and on the settled practice, before the statute

2

took its current form in 1984, which Congress chose not to

3

disturb.

4

Now,

I understand that if one gets to that level

5

of the analysis,

it is possible to quibble with whether

6

the Bureau is right in taking those two matters to in

7

effect impeach the plain meaning of the statute, but I

8

would argue to you, Justice O'Connor,

9

the remedy is to tell us, do not give credit to State

that if that's true,

10

prisoners, not to say that everything else goes, and we

11

think that within all of the normal tools of statutory

12

construction, we have a fairly coherent view of the

13

statute that accounts for the fairly unique nature of

14

giving credit toward a sentence of imprisonment that the

15

other side simply does not have.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask one other question?

17

What - - where do you place category - - the cases in which

18

the defendant is granted bail but doesn't have the money

19

to put up a bond?

20

MR. ESTRADA:

We place those in the category of

21

detention, Justice Stevens,

22

that the Bail Reform Act uses the word "detention1- not

23

only to refer to the type of

QUESTION:

25

Well,

and the reason for that is

that category of cases,

then,

1

irresponsible to let a person who cannot afford bail free

2

on his own recognizance, would he?

3

MR. ESTRADA:

4

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Justice Stevens.

You suggested earlier that it would

5

be irresponsible for a judge to let a person who is

6

remanded to the custody of the Attorney General free on

7

his or her recognizance, because there would necessarily

8

have been a finding of danger to the community or risk of

9

flight.

10

MR. ESTRADA:

11

QUESTION:

12

But supposing a person could not make

bail and there was no such finding.

13

MR. ESTRADA:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

That's right.

Well --

Then it would not be irresponsible to

turn him loose, would it?
MR. ESTRADA:

That is not right, Justice

17

Stevens, for the following reason.

18

bail under that condition is a judgment that the safety of

19

the community and the defendant showing up will not be

20

assured unless the bail condition is met.

21

The judgment to set

If he cannot meet the condition, the Attorney

22

General's judgment would in effect put us in the same

23

place as the earlier hypothetical, which is, the judge has

24

found that this will not be assured in the absence of the

25

condition, and the Attorney General is nonetheless

disregarding that judgment and setting the person free

Mr. Chief Justice, if I may, I would like --

QUESTION:

5

MR. ESTRADA:

6

Can I --- to reserve the remainder of my

time.

7

QUESTION:

I want to see if I can get one

8

additional.

I'm going back to the same question, but it

9

is what's bothering me.

You can make your clear meaning

10

of the statute work in the Federal system, I think, all

11

right, but to focus on what I think is bothering several

12

people, I once saw a film that showed what the systems are

13

in Alabama called intermediate punishments.

14

know if you've seen that or not, but you can get the idea.

15

MR. ESTRADA:

16

QUESTION:

Now, I don't

I haven't, Justice Breyer.

Well, but there are a whole range of

17

things called intermediate punishments, and so it's easy

18

for me to think of this wide range of different degrees of

19

confinement, et cetera, and to ask how your clear

20

statement meaning works in that context.
One way to make it work is to say, jail or not

21

22

23

jail.

That's what the circuit did.
Another way to make it work is to say, did they

24

use the magic word "bail"?

25

that word in this State.

But they may not have used
I don't know if they did or not.

A third way is to say, look to see if they're in

use that kind of concept.

4

States may not

So how does your absolute system work in the

5

world of intermediate punishments which could also be

6

imposed as conditions of bail without using the word bail?

7

MR. ESTRADA:

Our system is based on the notion

8

that most of the States have an authority that puts people

9

in jail and keeps them there, and therefore that is the

10

authority who, if they had custody legally over the

11

defendant, they get the defendant credit, and if that does

12

not happen, then the defendant does not get credit.

Mr. Chief Justice, if I could reserve --

MR. ROCHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I'd like to begin by following up on Justice

Stevens' hypothetical and asking the Court to imagine the

22

following.

23

Let us assume that on the same date that the

24

court ordered Mr. Koray confined to the premises of the

25

halfway house under a release on conditions order, which

commits him to the custody of pretrial services, that

2

there was a codefendant, and that on that same day the

3

court ordered that codefendant detained under a detention

4

order, but the court also recommended to the Attorney

5

General that that codefendant be placed in a community

6

based program or residence, which the Bureau of Prisons in

7

its own program statement suggests the court may do.
I'm looking particularly at the petition for

8

9
10
11

cert, the appendix, at page 46a.

It's the very top of the

page.
Let us assume the Bureau of Prisons takes that

12

recommendation in this hypothetical and confines the

13

codefendant to the same halfway house that Mr. Koray was

14

confined to, and let us assume that both men, they may be

15

dorm mates, they may be roommates, but for those same 150

16

days they are subject to the same, as Mr. Koray alleges,

17

jail-type rules that prevail in that halfway house.

18

According to the interpretation of the Bureau of

19

Prisons of the meaning of the words "official detention"

20

this anomalous result occurs.

21

QUESTION:

Could Mr. Koray have said, when he

22

was acquainted with the terms of his bail, if that's bail,

he requested bail.

realities of the situation, that a defendant simply coming

forward and asking for some kind of bail release, that

equally plausible and more likely is that the court may,

for its own reasons, have wanted to place him in a halfway

and the court may have decided to place him in the halfway

QUESTION:

So there's no showing -- you say that

he even requested a change from his jail confinement to

his - MR. ROCHMAN:

6

That is -- the record is not

clear, and I'm suggesting to the Court that a chronology

8

of events makes it unlikely that he requested it or that

if he requested it he got what he wanted.
Your Honor asked earlier about whether or not

10
11

Mr. Koray was informed as to the consequences of his being

12

confined at the halfway house as opposed to his earlier

13

confinement under a detention order, and I think that

14

Judge Sloviter in her opinion indicated a concern about

15

the unfairness of now not crediting a defendant with this

16

time if the defendant had not been advised at the time of

the order.

why isn't it equally good as a general criteria?
MR. ROCHMAN:

Because the statute, sir,.that we

we say it has a clear -- there's a plain meaning to be

found,

but the words "official detention" -QUESTION:

Well, if you construe it the way

10

Mr. Estrada argues, it probably is pretty clear.

are going to be close cases on either side of the line in

It's certainly true that the one

is that the test that can also be proposed, although it

may not be a bright line test, still has considerable

Justice Breyer asked

Not all

The problem with the Solicitor General's

rationale -- I should say, the Bureau of Prisons

12

rationale, what they argue is that the touchstone, or the

13

relevant condition is custody by the Attorney General, and

14

in the hypothetical that I attempted to suggest to the

15

Court earlier, it is the application of what they say the

16

meaning of official detention is that results in that

17

absurd, unreasonable, and glaringly unjust result.

18

Because the application of that principle,

making the touchstone custody of the Attorney General,

20

results in the codefendant confined in exactly the same

3

Over the course of the years, the bail reform statute --

4

had the words "in custody" in it.

Because the Congress in, or various Congresses

used the phrases "official detention," "official custody,"

10

"custody," and "confinement" interchangeably, every court

of appeals that has addressed the question, and the

12

Solicitor General agrees, has determined that no change in

13

the meaning of the statute was intended by the change of

words from "in custody" to "official detention."

15

If "official detention" and "in custody" mean

16

the same thing, as that legislative history and the

court's opinion say they do, then there are -- then court

18

opinions which interpreted the words "in custody" should

19

have direct bearing on the meaning of the words in the

would be correct, Justice Scalia, if the appearance of the

phrase "official detention," if that was its first

7

clear earlier, the words "official detention," the phrase

8

"official detention" goes back to 1 73, well before the
Bail Reform Act, well before the creation of the detention

They're not fraternal twins, and that is why I

12

say that the court -- every court of appeals that has

considered the question, the Solicitor General concedes

14

and agrees that this is so, that the use of the words

"official detention" connotes no change in the meaning of

"custody," and "custody," according -- in the unanimous

interpretation of the courts,

And that is why I believe in her well-reasoned

she permitted to situations involving total confinement or

reject things like residing in a halfway house but being

QUESTION:

Excuse me, I thought the predecessor

4

statute didn't use the term "official detention" but it

5

used the term "custody."

6

MR. ROCHMAN:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That's what I said.

I thought you were saying that the

8

predecessor - - I thought you said that the phrase

9

"official detention" did not come full-blown at the time

10

that the Bail Reform Act was enacted, but that it had a

11

long history.

12

MR. ROCHMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

with the word "custody" in it.

What had a long history is a statute

15

MR. ROCHMAN:

16

QUESTION:

18

Yes.

Yes, sir, but in - -

Not a statute with the word "official

detention" in it.
MR. ROCHMAN:

That is correct, but what I said

19

was that in the legislative history, starting in 1973,

20

there were various attempts to amend or revise the

21

statute, and in those suggested revisions of the statute

22

over the years, from 1973 up until 1984, the various

23

Congresses used interchangeably the phrases "custody,"

24

"official custody," "detention," and "official detention."

Thank you, Mr. Rochman.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

I would just like to emphasize that the standard

8

that was adopted by the court of appeals and is being

9

urged by respondent is unworkable.
What respondent has done in effect is to ask the

10
11

Court to come up with a set of essentially legislative

12

classifications based in part on what would be considered

13

probation under 3563.

14

In that connection, I would like to highlight,

15

as we did in our reply brief, that if you took all of the

16

conditions that respondent had in this case and asked what

17

those would be called if it were a sentence under the

18

Federal system, the answer would be that it is a sentence

19

of probation, not a sentence of imprisonment, and I would

20

refer the Court to section 3563(b) (12), which identifies

21

what happened here as a permissible condition of

22

probation.

23

QUESTION:

But you don't care about that.

24

That's just in case we don't accept your rationale of the

25

case.

MR. ESTRADA:

2

QUESTION:

i)

Well --

You're saying even if we accept the

incarceration rationale, you'd say this still wouldn't be
4
5

incarceration.
MR. ESTRADA:

Well, it shows as one of our
i

6

statutory arguments, Justice Scalia, that what Congress

7

was trying to do here was to provide credit for only one

8

type of Federal sentence.

9

This is a statute that deals with credit only

10

for one of the many possible Federal sentences that may be

11

imposed, and the fact that if we took everything that

12

happened here and asked what it would be called if it were

13

a sentence, and the answer is not what the statute gives

14

credit for, we think it's a very powerful textual
indication that this is not the type of case for which

16
17

credit was contemplated.
On the issue of lack of notice, I would like to

18

refer the Court to 18 U.S.C. 3142(h), which is part of the

19

bail statute, and has a specific list of matters that the

20

defendant must be advised of when he is granted bail,

21

including his duties under their bail bond and the absence

22

or any consequence as to credit is not one of them.

23

Thank you.

QUESTION:

25

MR. ESTRADA:

But, is not one of them, so you -Is not one of them.
