ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. MICHAEL SOKOLOW

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SOKOLOW:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against the

11
12

Government seeking a second punishment for the same

13

offense in a second prosecution.

14

is whether the Government's attempt to punish Mr. Witte

15

for cocaine offenses previously included in relevant

16

conduct violates that protection.

17

illustrate exactly what the Double Jeopardy Clause was

18

designed to protect against.

19

these Federal Sentencing Guidelines can be defeated and

20

eliminated.

The issue in this case

The facts of this case

They also illustrate how

21

Mr. Witte was sentenced to 12 years in Federal

22

prison after buying 375 pounds of marijuana from Federal

23

agents.

24

based upon a guideline range of 292 to 365 months, which

25

included all prior marijuana offenses and all prior

That sentence was based upon two things.

It was

1

cocaine offenses negotiated or committed by Mr. Witte.

2

was further based upon Mr. Witte's cooperation and a

3

Government request to reduce his sentence.
The Government has now indicted Mr. Witte for

4
5

the same cocaine offenses and seeks to punish him again.

6

The express language of the sentencing guidelines shows

7

that Mr. Witte was previously punished, and that he will

8

be punished again.
QUESTION:

9

The -May I just ask you a preliminary

10

question about that?

11

would receive a multiple punishment for the cocaine

12

offense if this second prosecution proceeds and he's

4

not received a second sentence.

QUESTION:

He has not yet

He hasn't been convicted in the

second proceeding?
MR. SOKOLOW:

9
20

That is correct.

I take it he has

been sentenced on the second prosecution.

7
8

Why is that claim ripe now?

MR. S0K0L0W:

5
6

It

He has not been convicted, that is

correct.

21

QUESTION:

And why, then, is that claim ripe?

22

MR. SOKOLOW:

The reason the claim is ripe is

23

because under the Federal Drug Guideline and the other

24

language of the guidelines, all offenses were merged for

25

purposes of punishment in the first prosecution, and

2

Mr. Witte has received all punishment that he can receive.
The Government is barred from the end --

3

obtaining the end of the second prosecution -- that is,

4

any further punishment.

5

there can be no criminal judgment.

6

the end and putting Mr. Witte through that process --

7

QUESTION:

Since there can be no punishment,
Thus, proceeding to

Well, I'm not sure that gives you a

8

claim at this juncture.

9

wondered how you would deal with it.

I was troubled by it, and I

10

I also am troubled by how you would distinguish

11

that case of Williams v. Oklahoma, where we held that the

12

use of evidence of an uncharged crime at sentencing for

13

the crime for which the prosecution succeeded, doesn't

14

constitute punishment for the uncharged conduct, and it

15

seemed to me quite close.

16

MR. S0K0L0W:

17

Honor, and here's why.

18

Court sought in vain for a cross-reference between the

19

murder statute and the kidnapping statute.

20

cross-reference -- that is, no merger of the two crimes

21

for purposes of prosecution, no merger of the two crimes

22

for purposes of punishment, it found no violation of the

23

Double Jeopardy Clause and said, well, this is just a mere

24

enhancement.

25

It is not close at all, Your
In Williams v. Oklahoma, this

1

and the policy decisions made by the Commission effect a

2

merger for purposes of punishment, and that is exactly

3

where the violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause - QUESTION:

4

Did the term -- did the opinion in

5

Williams v. Oklahoma use the term merger?

6

recently, and I don't recall it using that term.

7

MR. SOKOLOW:

I read it

It does not use that term, but it

8

does look specifically for a cross-reference between the

9

two statutes.

I infer from the Court's seeking a cross-

10

reference between the two statutes that it was looking for

11

some sort of merger that would prohibit either the second

12

prosecution or the second punishment, or it would not have

13

sought some cross-reference between the two statutes.

14

QUESTION:

What do you do with a case like

15

Williams v. New York, another Williams case, which says

16

that courts have traditionally taken into consideration

17

all sorts of conduct in deciding what sentence shall be

18

imposed?

19

MR. SOKOLOW:

Courts have traditionally done

20

that, and the only thing courts have had to look at prior

21

to the sentencing guidelines was what was in the statute.

22

Here we have a new set of sentencing guidelines that

23

specifically prescribe punishment, that specifically

24

merge, and --

25

QUESTION:

What do you mean by the term "merge"?

MR. SOKOLOW:

1

2

Well, for

let's forget the term

merged.

3

QUESTION:

I think that's a good idea.

4

MR. SOKOLOW:

Let's look at 2D1.1.

2D1.1 and

5

the grouping provisions state, group the offenses, drug

6

offenses, according to their weight.

7

say drug offenses present a fungible harm and therefore

8

ought to be grouped.

The guidelines also

9

So what happens is, the drug offenses, we arrive

10

at a guideline by grouping them, by getting a total weight

11

of the drugs.

12

Now, if the Government brings four charges,

13

let's say, the Drug Guidelines group them and come up with

14

one guideline range.

15

the Drug Guidelines still group the offenses and come up

16

with the same guideline range.

17

If the Government brings one charge,

What is happening in this case -- that is, if

18

Mr. Witte pleads guilty to all charges or one charge, the

19

guideline range is still the same.

20

this case is, the Government is bringing one charge.

21

guidelines, the mechanism still works the same way.

22

Witte has the same guideline range, and the Government

23

says, aha, all the offenses have been grouped, Mr. Witte

24

has gotten all the punishment he could get under the

25

guidelines, now let us lop off one of the merged offenses

The

4

that was punished - QUESTION:

I thought you weren't going to use

the term "merged."
MR. SOKOLOW:

Let us lop off one of the grouped

5

offenses that was punished, let us go back to the Federal

6

Criminal Code, let us charge another one of the offenses

7

that was grouped, and let us run Mr. Witte through the

8

sentencing guidelines again, where all offenses will be

9

grouped, and he will receive a second punishment on the

10
11

group offenses.
QUESTION:

He was not convicted the first time

12

of the same thing that he will be convicted of if a jury

13

comes in against him the second time, is that right?

14

MR. SOKOLOW:

That is correct, but the

15

guidelines, the Commission expressly made the decision to

16

minimize the significance of the charging system.

17

QUESTION:

So are you saying basically that the

18

guidelines prevent his being sentenced a second time, or

19

tried, or that because of what the guidelines do, the

20

Double Jeopardy Clause prevents it?

21

MR. SOKOLOW:

Because of what the guidelines do,

22

and the way they group offenses for punishment, the Double

23

Jeopardy Clause prohibits Mr. Witte being punished again

24

in the same exact way.

25

QUESTION:

And in punishment, what is his

1

exposure?

Would you explain that -- if there's one charge

2

or two charges in the first trial, it's going to end up

3

with the same range.

4

terms of length of incarceration as a consequence of the

5

second prosecution?

What is the additional exposure in

MR. SOKOLOW:

6

In the first prosecution, the

7

guideline range was 292 to 365 months, based on the

8

grouping of all offenses.

9

motion for a departure downward, the sentence was 144

10

Because of the Government's

months.
In the second prosecution, the relevant conduct

11
12

and guideline range will again be 292 to 365 months, so

13

Mr. Witte is looking, for the same grouped offenses at an

14

additional exposure at a minimum of 118 months, and for

15

the same grouped offenses, an additional exposure of 191

16

months, which I believe is approximately an additional 15

17

years.
QUESTION:

18
19

But if the sentences are

concurrent - MR. SOKOLOW:

20

If the sentences are concurrent,

21

he's still -- he is looking at an additional -- because

22

the Government made the motion for the downward departure,

23

and - -

QUESTION:

25

Leave it out of it.

Let's forget the downward departure.

served among these three:
1)

We have an indictment for both crimes, 2) we

3

have an indictment only for one, and the other crime is

4

considered relevant conduct, 3) we have an indictment for

5

one, the other considered relevant conduct, but a second

6

prosecution for the second crime.

7

Are you telling me that the total numbers will

8

differ in that third -- the total incarceration period

9

will differ?

10

That's what I don't understand.

MR. S0K0L0W:

I believe what the Government says

11

and what the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit says

12

should happen in the second prosecution is that, let's

13

assume Mr. Witte had gotten 292 months, a minimum under

14

the guideline range.

15

The Government and the Fifth Circuit are saying,

16

okay, he's been in jail 30 months when this second

17

prosecution sentence is handed down.

18

months, take off 30 months, and then run the 365 months

19

concurrent with the 262 left, so his exposure would be an

20

additional 15 years.

21

22

23

QUESTION:

If he gets 365

Do the guidelines require that the

sentences be concurrent?
MR. SOKOLOW:

Section 5G1.3(b) says that the

24

sentences should be concurrent, but that doesn't mean that

25

the second sentence will not add a significant amount to

1

the -- in other words, they're not going to be strictly

2

concurrent with the exact same amount of time.
QUESTION:

3

I understand that, but there will be

4

substantial concurrency, and the district court has no

5

authority to alter that result and impose a consecutive

6

sentence?
MR. S0K0L0W:

7

As the Fifth Circuit read it, and

8

as I read it, I do not believe the district court is going

9

to have any authority to allow Mr. Witte to walk out of

10

prison at the same time he would have after the first - QUESTION:

11

Why not?

I mean, the way it's

12

supposed to work, isn't it -- look, there are two separate

13

things.

14

One is the Double Jeopardy Clause.
I take it from the year 2, well before the

15

guidelines, a judge might decide, hey, I'm going to give

16

you 15 years, because I've looked at your record and there

17

are about three robberies here you've never been punished

18

for, but this is a very bad guy.

19

on, a year later, if the Government decides to indict him

20

for one of those three robberies, I've never seen a case

21

that says they couldn't do it.

And then indeed, later

22

But the guidelines, which is a different matter,

23

are supposed to not punish you twice for the same offense,

24

and they can't think of every possible unusual situation,

25

so why wouldn't you go in here and say, judge, look, I'd

1

like to tell you something.

2

all this conduct into account.

3

In this first case, they took

Now, I know that the guidelines haven't written

4

words for every situation, but what you ought to do is

5

depart downward in this unusual situation in order to take

6

this fact into account, which is very unusual.

7

And you'll make all your arguments, and if the

8

judge concludes that indeed this is really a gyp that the

9

Government's indicting him twice, maybe he'll listen to

10

you, and if the judge concludes that maybe your client did

11

something that the Government didn't reasonably expect him

12

to do, maybe they won't listen.

13

But I mean, isn't this just the situation that

14

you should put your argument to a judge as a matter of

15

discretion and departure, and not an argument to the Court

16

as a matter of Double Jeopardy law?

17

MR. SOKOLOW:

No, it's not, and here's why.

We

18

already know what the Fifth Circuit answer's going to be.

19

The Fifth Circuit answer is going to be, Mr. Witte, go

20

serve an additional --

21

QUESTION:

No, no, it's not the Fifth Circuit

22

trial, it will be up to the sentencing judge in the

23

future, in a trial we've never even had yet.

24
25

MR. SOKOLOW:

But we know that the sentencing

judge is going to follow the guidelines.

QUESTION:

1

2

But the guidelines permit departure,

is my point.

3

MR. SOKOLOW:

4

QUESTION:

They --

And isn't this exactly the kind of

5

situation that if, in fact, your client is being badly

6

treated in the way you suggest, the judge ought to listen

7

to your argument and follow it, otherwise not.
MR. SOKOLOW:

8

9

I don't see -- I understand that

you're talking about 5K2.0, where it wasn't considered by

10

the Sentencing Commission, but I don't see how a judge

11

could reduce the sentence and make it run strictly

12

concurrently.

The --

13

QUESTION:

Why not?

14

MR. SOKOLOW:

The argument on the other side

15

would be -- if the Government prevails in this case, the

16

argument on the other side is, well, judge, clearly the

17

Commission considered this under 5G1.3(b), and clearly

18

this is the way it's supposed to work.
How can -- if 5G1.3(b) does apply, and

19
20

Mr. Witte, as the Fifth Circuit said, is supposed to get

21

an additional 118 months, how can you walk in front of a

22

district judge and say, judge, the Sentencing Commission

23

hasn't considered this, even though the Supreme Court and

24

the Fifth Circuit say 5G1.3(b) applies, please reduce the

25

sentence?

1

They'll say back to me, wait a minute, 5G1.3(b)

2

expressly applies, even though we disagree with that, but

3

that will be the answer.
QUESTION:

4

This is the argument you would make,

5

I guess, in the future.

Look, the theory of the thing is,

6

if the thing has'been taken into account the first time,

7

the judge isn't supposed to do it the second time.

8

He's

You have a very unusual situation, I take it,

9
10

because the first time involved a special credit for

11

cooperation, so that's unusual, and you'll go to the court

12

and explain all the reasons why the judge should try to

13

make the thing match as a departure, and the Government, I

14

take it, would put contrary reasons, if that's what they

15

think.

16

for that reason, departure might be called for, or might

17

not be.

18
19
20

But isn't yours quite an unusual circumstance, and

I didn't see anything in any of the opinions
that addressed that problem.
MR. S0K0L0W:

It is an unusual circumstance.

I

21

think if Mr. Witte does not prevail here, I think that the

22

Government will have an argument that 5G1.3(b) does

23

expressly take that into account, and therefore I will be

24

foreclosed.

25

But in addition, if Mr. Witte has received all

1

of the punishment he should have received under the

2

sentencing guidelines for the group defenses, why does the

3

Government have the right to put him through the jeopardy

of facing more punishment that he should not get under the

sentencing guidelines?

with us or not?
Why should he go through that anxiety when the

Why should Mr. Witte be waiting in

sentencing guidelines have worked the way they should have

10

worked in accordance with the policy of Congress to bring

11

about uniformity in sentencing, to bring about

12

proportionality in sentencing, in accordance with the

13

policy and the sentencing guidelines to reduce the

14

significance of the charging decision, to avoid double

15

counting for drug crimes, to treat them as fungible harms?

16

When Mr. Witte goes up and faces his Maker to

17

receive from 262 to 365 months on all those offenses, why

18

should he again go to meet his Maker for the very same

19

offenses?
And Mr. Witte's argument does not apply across

20
21

the board.

The guidelines are not monolithic.

The

22

guidelines make policy decisions about what is a fungible

23

harm and what isn't a fungible harm.

have a different situation if Mr. Witte had committed five

guidelines, or assaults are not grouped under the

guidelines.
QUESTION:

3

There wouldn't be any problem if they

4

were all tried in the same proceeding.

5

these -- you wouldn't have any objection.

6

MR. SOKOLOW:

7

QUESTION:

You wouldn't say

That is correct.

That is correct.

So I - - there's nothing that seems so

8

obvious to me about the injustice of doing it one way or

9

the other.

When you say that all that injustice can

10

simply be eliminated by trying them all in one proceeding,

11

the double punishment doesn't seem to me such a horrible

12

thing.

13

punishment that's the problem, it's not bringing them all

14

in one proceeding that's the problem.

You're just saying -- really, it isn't the double

15

MR. SOKOLOW:

It's not bringing them all in one

16

proceeding, because he's forced to be put in jeopardy

17

again for the same guideline range and additional

18

punishment.

19
20

QUESTION:

You're not worried about the

jeopardy, you're complaining about the punishment.

21

MR. SOKOLOW:

22

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And you say that's perfectly okay, so

23

long as they all did it in one proceeding?

MR. SOKOLOW:

There - - if I understand the

hypothetical correctly, the danger of having the second

Is the range any different?
The range -- the range is not

So the exposure is the same whether

it's one trial on two charges or consecutive trials each

11

on one of the charges.

12

MR. SOKOLOW:

The exposure under the range is

13

the same, yes, but the way the Fifth Circuit calculated

it, you only get credit for time that you've served, so if

the same sentence is imposed - -

QUESTION:

Isn't the answer -- I mean, the

17

answer is, it's supposed to work out the same.

18

supposed to, but because of the way in which two

19

consecutive trials can come about, unusual circumstances

20

can arise where the literal wording of the guideline can't

do it because, for example, one might have been a State

trial and the other a Federal trial, or one -- the second

That's right.

There's nothing to

Now the Government lops off one of those

Mr. DuMont,

MR. DuMONT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This Court's cases have always permitted

23

consideration at sentencing of conduct that is not part of

24

the offense of conviction, whether or not that conduct has

25

led to other convictions, precisely because the sentence

imposed at any given proceeding constitutes punishment

2

only for the offense that is actually before the court in

3

that proceeding.
QUESTION:

4

Will you tell us, in response to the

5

question Justice O'Connor asked of the petitioner's

6

counsel, if in your view there is no prematurity here,

7

that we have the issue squarely before us, and subsidiary

8

to that, why are you prosecuting this person a second time

9

if you don't intend to enhance his punishment?
MR. DuMONT:

10

In response to the first question,

11

we think that, although there is some slight doubt on it,

12

we think the issues are squarely presented.

13

doubt would arise if you could not reach the double

14

jeopardy question until the sentencing stage of the second

15

trial.

16

The only

That would depend on the determination that

17

conviction could be had in the second proceeding

18

without -- as long as there was no sentence, there would

19

be no jeopardy problem.

20

inconsistent with the Court's decision in Ball v. United

21

States, and also there's another case called Woodward, I

22

believe, where the Court took notice of the $50 special

23

assessments that are required under Federal law, and said

24

that those were enough to prevent two sentences from being

25

completely concurrent.

1

Yes.

The sense I have is that the

2

whole purpose of prosecuting him is so that you can impose

3

some additional punishment.

leads to the second question I asked.

MR. DuMONT:

MR. DuMONT:

Now, maybe that -- and that

Well, I -Or is that correct?
I think there are a variety of

8

interesting and difficult questions raised by the notion

9

of what the proper sentence would be at the second

10

proceeding.

I don't think it's necessary -- it is not why

11

we prosecuted the crimes separately that we intended

12

additional punishment.
QUESTION:

13

Well, what if, at the second

14

proceeding, if the conviction were obtained and if the

15

sentence imposed were identical to the one previously

I thought the Government was busy,

that it had a heavy criminal case load.
MR. DuMONT:

3

We do, and I think if you read the

transcript of the dismissal hearing on the second charge

you will find the judge was very concerned about that, but

I don't think it has ever been considered to take away our

right to bring a second charge on a different offense, no

matter what punishment may or may not -- no matter whether

9

that conduct may or may not have been taken into account

in a prior separate offense prosecution at sentencing.
QUESTION:

11
12

But the difference in this case from

the Williams and the other cases is that the conduct may

mandatory for sentencing purposes is the statutory maximum

in the case of his marijuana conduct was 5 to 40 years.

Now, it turns out that however you applied the

It's the

The fact that Congress in the sentencing

completely irrelevant to whether it was a sentencing

21

consequence, which is that every recidivist statute in

law.

QUESTION:

What the problem, I think, was -- I

15

mean, I don't want to put words in other people's mouths,

16

but I thought that Justice Stevens was driving at the

17

different problem of a later prosecution, and what you are

18

prosecuting this person for is the thing for which he was

19

punished previously, required by law.

20

That's not the recidivism statute at all.

In a

21

recidivism statute you're punishing the person for what he

22

did later, and the amount of the punishment is a function

23

of what happened before.

24

doing later is you're convicting him of an activity for

25

which he was previously punished.

But in this case, what you're

You're not increasing punishment because of what

2

he previously did for a different thing.

3

convicting him of what he has previously been punished

4

for, and that -- and since these matters are matters of

5

criminal -- of congressional intent, there is an open

6

question, I suppose, about whether the Congress in passing

7

these sentencing guidelines has, in fact, manifested some

8

kind of relevant intent.
I'm not saying you're wrong.

9

You are

I'm simply saying

10

it's not so obvious a question as the recidivism quotation

11

would suggest.
MR. DuMONT:

I may.

flaw in the way you --

Now,

the second point you make --

That's true.
--

is an excellent one and you

8

made it before, which is,

there are really two possible

9

arguments the petitioner can be making here, and he

10

conflates them, but I think it's necessary to separate

11

them out.
One is an argument based on the Constitution,

12

13

that what we are doing violates double jeopardy per se and

14

that, we think,

15

been discussing,

16

contrary on both sentencing and due process.

is wrong for all the reasons that we've
that all these Court's cases are to the

Now, there is also a statutory argument, I

17
18

suppose,

19

it passes -- passed the guidelines and the Sentencing

20

Reform Act to so transform the sentencing system that it

21

would in effect forbid, as a matter of statutory law,

22

subsequent prosecution and successive prosecutions of this

23

type.

24
25

that could be made,

that Congress intended when

Now, we think that that cannot hold up,

all because there is no positive indication anywhere in

1

the language or the history of the Sentencing Reform Act

2

or the guidelines to suggest that that's what Congress had

3

in mind, and second because the guidelines themselves in

4

section 5G .3 have an explicit mechanism which is designed

5

to take care of exactly this kind of situation, where you

6

have successive prosecutions for the same kind of conduct,

7

in fact, the same exact conduct.
Now, it is implausible that Congress addressed,

8

9

then the Sentencing Commission addressed that issue

10

specifically in 5G .2 if they thought that it was

11

unconstitutional anyway, given what they had done to the

12

definition of offenses.

3

To return for a moment to the issue of what you

4

are punished for when you are punished, no matter what is

5

being taken into account, I'd like to just point out one

6

example.

7

prosecution here happened to be 370 pounds, and that put

8

Mr. Witte in the statutory sentencing category of 5 to 40

9

years, a very broad category which, as I mentioned,

The amount of marijuana involved in the first

20

accommodated any of the possible changes in the guidelines

21

range depending on the relevant conduct.

22

But supposing it had been 50 kilograms of

23

marijuana, then his statutory maximum sentence under

24

section 84 , leaving aside unlikely other events, would

25

have been 5 years.

Now, suppose that the guidelines range, as it

1

2

would have been, would have been 33 to 41 months, in the

3

middle of that 5-year range, and suppose the district

4

court had taken account of the other 232,000 kilograms of

5

marijuana equivalent that it took account of in this case

6

as relevant conduct.

7

It would have wanted - - it would have been

8

required to enhance his sentence, but it would have hit a

9

statutory maximum of 5 years, and it would have been able

10

to impose no sentence greater than 5 years, because that's

11

the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction.
QUESTION:

12

13

Yes, but that's not this case, and

you don't have a statutory maximum.

14

MR. DuMONT:

15

QUESTION:

It's not this case.
Supposing just the opposite,

16

supposing that that would have required a 20-year

17

sentence, say there was no statutory maximum, and then --

18

but they only indicted him for the lesser amount, and

19

you're saying they could impose that sentence and then

20

subsequently indict him for the larger amount and then

21

impose an additional sentence.

22

it not?

23
24
25

MR. DuMONT:

That's your position, is

As a constitutional matter, if the

two offenses are separate, that's absolutely right.

MR. DuMONT:

I have no case where there was a

him for those burglaries later.

3

QUESTION:

No, but it seems somewhat

4

counterintuitive to me to say that a man could be punished

5

for relevant conduct in proceeding A, yet have that

6

aggravate a sentence that would not otherwise have been

7

imposed, then say in proceeding B, we can go ahead and

8

punish him again for the same relevant conduct, and all

9

I'm suggesting is, your position is without any precedent.
MR. DuMONT:

10

Well, I would say that my position

11

is I think with a great deal of precedent, although I

12

can't cite you a specific case where, as you say, the

13

judge was required in the first case to take account of

14

the same conduct, although I suspect that there are such

cases.

exist.

18

I can't think of one off the top of my head.

That

Now, what I think the logic of your argument and

19

petitioner's argument has to be is that it makes a

20

difference whether the court in the first case is required

21

by Congress to take into account certain things as

22

sentencing factors, or whether it is not required to take

them into account but is allowed to do so as a matter of

discretion.

MR. DuMONT:

That's entirely a matter of -- it

goes to the fact that the Court has always said that it is

20

Congress or the legislature in any given case that is

21

entitled to choose what is an element of the offense and

22

what is a sentencing factor.

23

Now, the Court has recognized that there are

24

cases where that might potentially be manipulated.

25

MacMillan, I think, stands for this proposition, that the

1

Court will take cognizance that the legislature might try

2

to manipulate that and slip something that should really

3

be an offense element into the sentencing phase.

4

But until the legislature does that, and there's

5

no case that has ever held that the legislature has done

6

that, until they do that, what the legislature decides is

7

an offense element and a sentencing factor controls, and

8

if it's a sentencing factor, it need only be proved by a

9

preponderance, although of course Congress could prescribe

10

something greater, and it does not go to the question of

11

whether you've been punished for that conduct.

12

only had that conduct taken into account in enhancing your

3

punishment for something else, of which you have been duly

convicted.

Why isn't there this precedent, and there

of States have guidelines systems now, and you should find

the State might try to prosecute somebody for a thing
