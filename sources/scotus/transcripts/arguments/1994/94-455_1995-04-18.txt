ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ROTHFELD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ROTHFELD:

8

9

: 5 a.m.)

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether a public

0

official who sued under section

983 and whose response is

2

that he did nothing wrong has asserted a defense of

3

qualified immunity that may be raised on interlocutory

4

appeal.

5

In answering that question, I think it's useful

6

to divide it into three component parts and to consider

7

them separately.

8
9

First, whether an official who says that he did
not violate clearly established law because he didn't

20

violate the law at all has asserted a defense of qualified

2

immunity, second, whether the validity of that defense is

22

somehow called into question by the existence of a

23

predicate factual dispute about what the defendant did,

24

and third, whether an immunity defense of this kind

25

satisfies the Cohen test for interlocutory appeals, and

I'll consider those three points in turn.
QUESTION:

What was the second point again?

went too fast for me.
MR. ROTHFELD:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

The

5

second issue, which I think is an integral component of

6

the first, is whether the existence of a predicate factual

7

dispute about what it is that the defendant did somehow

8

calls into question the validity of what otherwise would

9

be a valid qualified immunity defense.

10

On the first point, whether or not there is an

11

immunity defense at all, the court of appeals was of the

12

view that immunity comes into play only to protect public

13

officials who acted in the face of legal uncertainty, and
therefore, under the court's approach, a public official

*
15

who says that he didn't violate clearly established law

16

because the law was in a state of flux or uncertainty when

17

he acted, does state an immunity claim and may take an

18

interlocutory appeal if that defense is denied.

19

But under this approach, the public official who

20

says that he did not violate clearly established law

21

because there is no evidence that he violated the law at

22

all does not raise an immunity claim and cannot take an

23

interlocutory appeal.

24
25

Now, we think that that approach is based on a
fundamental misunderstanding of the immunity doctrine.

1

Immunity is not designed solely to protect public

2

officials who face legal uncertainty when they act.

3

Instead, the Court has repeatedly defined qualified

4

immunity to protect all official defendants who did not

5

violate clearly established law.

6

necessarily includes defendants who did not violate the

7

law at all either because they didn't commit the acts

8

alleged or because the acts alleged were clearly

9

constitutional.

That is a group that

That point follows directly, I think, from the

10
11

purposes of the immunity doctrine as repeatedly stated by

12

the Court.

13

like Harlow --

14

The Court has said time and again in cases

QUESTION:

You're immune if you're innocent?

15

How can you possibly apply a doctrine like that, you're

16

immune if you're innocent.

17

innocent until you've been -- until the facts have been

18

displayed.

19

You don't know whether you're

I mean, it seems to me an immunity doctrine

20

divorced from reference to some principle of law seems to

21

me meaningless.

22

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think, Your Honor, that

23

we're not saying that we shouldn't be liable here.

24

saying that we have a conceptually distinct immunity from

25

suit because we didn't violate clearly established law,

You're saying public officials should

As I

did not violate the law, clear as it may be, in effect at

2

the time of the acts.
MR. ROTHFELD:

3
4

Well, I think that's right, but

there are two aspects - -

5

QUESTION:

And that's a different concept of

6

immunity from the normal qualified immunity concept in

7

which your first concern is that public officials should

8

not have to guess about possible changes in the law or

9

clarifications of the law that occur after they act.
Here, you're saying the claim for immunity is

10
11

satisfied, in effect, by the value in not subjecting them

12

to trial, period, unless there's a genuine dispute of

13

fact, the kind of thing that you raise on summary

14

judgment.

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think there are a number

16

of aspects that are being connected here, Your Honor.

17

think it's useful to look at them individually.

18

is the question of, can we claim immunity because we

19

didn't violate the law at all, and I think that this

20

Court's decision in Siegert v. Gilley makes clear that we

21

can, that the first step involving an immunity claim is to

22

decide whether the plaintiff has alleged --

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Rothfeld, maybe I can clarify

24

what the problem seems to be, at least for me, this way.

MR. ROTHFELD:

Isn't that what your point is?
That is -- that would --

theoretically it would be possible in every case.
QUESTION:

5

Not theoretically.

Your position is,

6

I didn't do it.

The question is, is there sufficient

7

evidence to go to trial, every 1983 case on a clear

8

question of evidentiary sufficiency, no question of what

9

the law is, just evidentiary sufficiency?
MR. ROTHFELD:

10

On the question of whether there

11

is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the

12

defendant committed a constitutional violation, that is

13

our position, and let me - -

That may be a very good rule, but I

just question your trying to sneak it in under the name

immunity.

MR. ROTHFELD:

QUESTION:

Well, let me, if I can --

It does not bear any resemblance to a

doctrine of immunity.

It's a doctrine of automatic

If I can take a step back and try

22

to describe the conceptual framework which I think makes

23

clear what it is that we're asking for, in resolving an

24

immunity claim there are going always to have to be two

25

steps.

The allegation is that what the defendant did

1

-i.

2

violates clearly established law.
In addressing that claim, the court has to a)

3

make some assumption about what the defendant did and then

4

apply the clearly established law to that state of facts,

5

so looking first at whether the law was clearly

6

established or not, clearly we cannot lose the immunity

7

claim, because the law was clear that what we did was

8

constitutional, so the fact that the claim here is that

9

the defendant ultimately didn't violate the law at all

10
11

shouldn't detract from the immunity claim.
The second step of the inquiry is then, all

12

right, let's look at what the defendant did and decide

13

whether that violated clearly established law.

14

Now, there typically are disputes about what

15

defendants have done, in cases in which immunity is

16

claimed, and in that situation the court has to make some

17

assumption about what the defendant did.

18

accept the allegation of the complaint, or it can look to

19

the summary judgment record.

20

QUESTION:

It can either

It seems to me that immunity is

21

usually used to characterize a situation in which had the

22

official been a private person he would have been liable,

23

but by reason of his official status he is not.

24
25

If that's true, then I think what you're
proposing here would be inadequate, and would be wrong.

MR. ROTHFELD:

1

Well, I think certainly, Justice

2

Kennedy, preventing liability for public officials who

3

acted in a state of legal uncertainty is a purpose of the

4

immunity doctrine, but immunity has considerably broader

5

purposes, and Siegert I think demonstrates clearly that

6

the principle that only officials who did violate the

7

Constitution but did so at a time when it all was in flux,

8

I think that is not the only purpose, but the conclusion

9

in Siegert was that the official defendant was entitled to

10

immunity, because the plaintiff had not made out a

11

violation of the Constitution at all.
QUESTION:

12

The Court said --

Mr. Rothfeld, wouldn't it be better

13

to stick with this category?

14

the law is not clear.

15

another category where plaintiff says -- defendant says,

16

what I did doesn't add up to a violation of Federal law,

17

typical 12(b)(6) case, and this case where, if I did it,

18

I'm liable, but I say I didn't do it, so why don't we just

19

stick with that case?

We have one category where

That's not this case.

You've already said candidly that every

good on the facts, not nearly as good as the trial court,

so why don't we leave that question of evidentiary

sufficiency to the trial judge and say, but when it's a

question of law, then you could take your interlocutory

appeal?

Well, I think there are several

answers to that, Justice O'Connor -- Justice Ginsburg.

I've done this before, and I apologize.

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think that first of all we have some

10

significant empirical evidence of how good the courts are

11

in handling appeals of this sort.

12

that have adopted the rule that we are endorsing here.

13

They have applied it for some years, and have not had any

14

difficulty in sorting through these factual records.

is the kind of inquiry that courts make routinely when

they review decisions granting summary judgment motions,

So you don't think that trial judges

19

on the whole have a better feel for facts than courts of

appeal judges?

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, I don't, but the question

22

here is a legal question of whether or not there is a

23

genuine issue of material fact, and the Court has

24

recognized repeatedly that is a question of law.

25

a question that the courts of appeals resolve routinely,

That is

1

as I say, on appeals with -QUESTION:

2

Well, Mr. Rothfeld, this -- my

3

question ties in with that of Justice Ginsburg.

Typically

4

on a question like this the district court will decide

5

whether there's enough evidence to go to trial.
In this case, the police officer found the

6

7

plaintiff banging his head against the wall, and by the

8

time the arrest had been completed and he'd been hauled

9

off to jail, he was found to have suffered from broken

10

ribs and other physical injuries that are not consistent

11

with banging the head against the wall.
Now, the trial judge thought that was enough

12

13

circumstantial evidence to let it go to trial.

14

seems to me it would be a very rare case that the court of

15

appeals is going to second guess that kind of thing and

16

say, oh, no, you've got it wrong, it shouldn't go to trial

17

at all.

18

Now, it

There may be circuits that are allowing this

19

kind of thing, but in how many instances is the court of

20

appeals really reversing the trial judge's determination

21

of the facts?

22

not very practical.

23

I think you're asking for something that's

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think, to the contrary --

24

let me make two points in response to that.

25

First, in a

are taken, a majority of the reported decisions, the

2

decisions of the district courts denying summary judgment

3

motions, are overturned by the court of appeals, and we

4

cite a number of these decisions in footnote 3 of our

5

brief, of our opening brief.

6

And that I think is because there are

7

substantial institutional constraints that prevent public

8

officials in this situation from taking insubstantial

9

appeals, because they are faced with additional section

10

1983 attorney's fees liability if they ultimately lose on

11

the merits, because the district courts and the courts of

12

appeals both have procedures for weeding out insubstantial

13

claims.

14

In fact, in every case --

15

QUESTION:

Maybe we should extend that to

16

everybody in 1983 cases.

17

who -- every defendant who makes a summary judgment motion

18

ought to be able to get an interlocutory appeal.

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

Maybe everybody in a 1983 case

Well, I think, Your Honor, we

20

should not depart from the basic principle that the Court

21

has stated repeatedly in its immunity decisions in Harlow

22

and in Anderson and in Mitchell, over and over, that the

23

point of the immunity doctrine, the fundamental purpose,

24

is to prevent the trial of insubstantial claims because of

25

all the familiar reasons that insubstantial suits against

1

innocent public officials, because of the burdens that

2

those impose on the political system and the court.
QUESTION:

3

That is the purpose of the immunity

4

doctrine, but it does not follow that everything that

5

deters or prevents the trial of insubstantial claims is

6

immunity.

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

8

QUESTION:

9

No, that --

Your equating it with the immunity

doctrine simply because this new device would happen to

10

achieve the same end, it would, but it seems to me new

11

law - -

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

13

QUESTION:

14

Well, I'm using, Your Honor --

-- and not the immunity doctrine at

all.

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

I'm using the court's definition

16

of immunity, which is that it protects all public

17

officials who did not violate clearly established law,

18

which necessarily, as I say, includes officials who didn't

19

violate the law at all.
QUESTION:

20

It would be a perverse result --

But immunity -- to my mind, it's a

21

defense.

22

violation, the answer is, that may all be true, but I have

23

this immunity defense available, whereas you're really

24

attacking the allegations of the complaint.

1

Mr. Chief Justice, the Court concluded that the first step

2

was to determine whether or not there had been a violation

3

of the law.

4
5

QUESTION:

In Siegert, there was no dispute

about the facts.

6

MR. ROTHFELD:

7

QUESTION:

That's true.

We didn't take that to reevaluate the

8

factual conclusions or the summary judgment conclusions of

9

the lower courts.

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's true, and if it is -- if

11

we accept the proposition that there is an immunity

12

defense stated when there has been no violation of law at

13

all because then there necessarily hasn't been a violation

14

of clearly established law, you're led to the question of,

15

does the existence of the factual dispute somehow preclude

16

the appeal of that issue, and again, the court has to make

17

some assumption about what the defendant did so that it

18

can apply to clearly established law.

19

In making that assumption, it either sticks with

20

the allegations in the complaint,

21

entire summary judgment record.

22

or it looks at the

Now, the Court's decision in Anderson v.

district court is not stuck with the allegations in the

complaint, when there's a factual dispute about what the

2

The court will look to the entire record, will

3

apply Rule 56, as it ordinarily does, and will decide

whether there's a genuine issue of material fact.

When appeal is taken, the question then is, is

10

the court of appeals stuck with what the district court

11

said about whether there is a genuine issue of material

fact.

13

that the district court may consider the entire summary

14

judgment record, and the court of appeals cannot.

15

Ordinarily, the courts of appeals consider on appeal of a

question which is legitimately before them, and the

Harlow has been repeated in all of these Court's cases.

The innocent defendant, as the defendant in Harlow was

characterized, the defendant who has done nothing wrong,

should not be subjected to the burdens of litigation for

The reason this Court in Mitchell recognized a

exercises of discretion as long as they don't violate

Fear of baseless suits can create skewed

incentives and drive public officials to inaction when the

12

public interest requires that they act.

and here I think that it is.

3

I wanted to add a response to some of the

4

questions from the bench to Mr. Rothfeld from Justices

5

O'Connor and Ginsburg, who I think were suggesting that it

6

perhaps might be more practical to defer to what the

7

district court does in sifting the evidence, and limit

8

this kind of appeal under Mitchell to the circumstance

9

where there's really a doctrinal question for the court of

10

appeals to address, and I have two responses to that, and

11

one is really addressing the policies of recognizing a

12

right not to be tried, and the second is perhaps more

13

technical.

14

That idea of making a distinction between legal

15

issues that have to do with sifting the evidence and legal

16

issues that are more doctrinal runs contrary to the

17

fundamental impetus of Harlow.

18

reformulated the qualified immunity inquiry precisely to

19

ensure that qualified immunity would be more susceptible

of pretrial disposition by the courts and less likely to

21

be tied up with a jury disposition on the facts, and to

say that Mitchell, in turn, takes a unique and narrow view

Here, there's no

That's right, and my point was

really on a slightly more general level, that the notion

of taking what doesn't require a jury trial.

Perhaps a

motive inquiry would require a jury trial.
Here, under Rule 56, it's established that that

10
11

doesn't infringe any Seventh Amendment jury right, or it

12

doesn't entrench on the fact-finder's rule, and yet the

13

suggestion, I think, is that even there we're going to

14

leave that inquiry with the district courts, and I think

15

that cuts against the impetus of Harlow to say, let's take

16

as much of this as we can, make it a legal determination,

and make it susceptible of disposition pretrial, and then

again, if the district court errs, susceptible to

QUESTION:

20

It seems to me if we adopt your

position that one way to curtail the number of appeals

is one of the mechanisms that the courts of appeals have

QUESTION:

Would you agree with that position,

adduced after a summary judgment disposition the first go-

MS. PILLARD:

I think a rule restricting to one

interest in finality that might -- adherent in the Cohen

There's no doubt if he shot the

Now, you can stop the appeals coming up all the

time on that through just what Justice Kennedy suggested,

6

though that goes into the case we're hearing in October.

7

But the other practical thing that bothered me

8

is this, that if you do that, you get these cases in the

9

courts of appeals that are very complicated factually,

10

with people's motives, and very often district courts in

those circumstances just say, send it to trial, and the

that's why it sent it to trial, and that struck me as a

kind of mess.

like to get your response to that.

MS. PILLARD:

MS. PILLARD:

How could you?

For the same reason the district

court applied Rule 56 --

-- mess go to trial.

You'd have --- that way.

The court of appeals

could do that as well if there was some suggestion there.
But I think also your point is premised on a

14

distinction that just wouldn't work, and I think if you

15

take a hypothetical from the Mitchell case itself, that

16

shows why that distinction would frustrate even the core

17

qualified immunity claim.

18

For example, if the district court in Mitchell

19

had not denied qualified immunity because it found the law

20

was clear, but instead had denied it by erroneously

21

holding that there was a dispute in the evidence in that

22

case about whether there was a national security

23

justification for the wire tap, the court of appeals in

24

that kind of case has to look at the record to conclude

25

that the district court was wrong.

1

that error, the court of appeals would be unable to verify

2

that the claim falls within the gray area and that

3

qualified immunity is warranted.

4

Now, that kind of review, the sifting of the

5

evidence, has to be available in that case, otherwise

6

Mitchell would have been deprived of immunity, his conduct

7

would have been the same, the state of the law would have

8

been the same, and the interest in prompt disposal in that

9

case would have been the same as they were in the Mitchell

10

case, so a refusal to consider a district court's error

11

when it inheres in the evaluation of whether the facts

12

meet the Rule 56 standard is something that has to be

amenable to interlocutory review.

MR. PROCTOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The question presented here is whether there is

an absolute right to an appeal,.an interlocutory order

22

denying a motion for summary judgment, where a trial judge

23

found that there was a genuine issue of material fact in

1

That's what I hear as being the issue in this case.

2

The general rule is clear that with very narrow

3

exceptions denials of motion for summary judgment are not

4

immediately appealable.

5

subject to, but you must wait for final judgment.

6

That's the law everyone is

The reasons for the final judgment rule are to

7

avoid delay and unnecessary appeals, precisely what would

8

result if the decision below were not upheld.

9

Thus, if only a claim in this case were assault

10

and battery based on the same events that are alleged in

11

this complaint, there's no dispute that there would be no

12

interlocutory appeal.

13

fact the petitioners are police officers who claim

14

qualified immunity because they allege they did not do the

15

acts alleged, whether that changes the result.

16

The only question is whether the

In this case, I believe

this would be the first case scenario where an officer

says, I didn't do anything, or I was out of town, or I was

there but I didn't do anything or nothing happened.

That should not get upstairs because Mitchell

wanted cases to be dismissed before discovery.

the rationale in Mitchell.

whatsoever.

11

require that discovery be done in order for an appellate

Secondly, it's not the type of question that had

how can you avoid, if you're in the court of appeals,

policeman was standing, and once you admit that, you're

has to look to see what the evidence will support as to

asking the court of appeals to reach an important,

necessary, because there is a strong argument that the

facts don't establish the position anyway, and that this

is reversing the usual presumption, which is that we don't

reach constitutional issues unless we have to, and the

defendant in this case says you don't have to.

2

should not be doing that, and they in effect should simply

3

be deciding the qualified immunity issues based on the

4

facts pleaded in the plaintiff's pleadings and go no

5

further, and if that's -- if they confine their review to

that, then it would be very easy to make a distinction

between that kind of a case and the case that is before us

You could say, under your position, that the

only issue that the court of appeals should be reviewing

constitutional right, or similar issues of law, but that

if it is necessary in a case in order to reach the issue

to look at a summary -- to look at the facts and the

Justice Breyer asked before a positive and more

inconsistent statements being made and thousands of pages,

perhaps, of deposition testimony, and that, it's our

MR. PROCTOR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I would like to just start with trying to

10

further answer questions that were posed by Justice Breyer

11

and Justice Kennedy this morning with respect to what

12

facts, if in fact these types of appeals are to be

13

allowed, should the appellate court consider, and as I

14

thought about it, if it's a motion to dismiss in the

15

pleading stage, my answer to that would be the pleadings.

16

If it's a motion, denial of a motion for summary

17

judgment, in my estimation the appellate court should only

18

review the facts that the district court found persuasive,

19

or that the district court lays out in the appeal.

20

The district court will write an opinion, and

21

did so in this case, laying out the facts that in this

22

case she relied upon.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But of course, the district court

doesn't find facts on a motion for summary judgment.

No.

not a question of fact exists, or decide whether or not

sufficient facts, or really, if there was a fact that a

13

jury could find would prove the guilt or innocence.

what the appellate court should not be doing.

I don't think the appellate court

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ROTHFELD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Let me start with the hypothetical that was

presented at the opening argument by Justice Breyer.

of law and a factual dispute?

lies in that case.

What

There's no doubt an appeal

When it gets to the court of appeals, what state

10

of facts should the court assume?

11

every circuit, as the Seventh Circuit has pointed out,

12

including the Seventh Circuit, does not consider itself

13

bound either by the statement in the complaint or by the

14

district court's conclusion.

15

appeals itself makes a determination of whether there's a

genuine issue of material fact by looking to the entire

summary judgment record, and that approach makes perfect

18

sense.

19

As matters now stand,

Instead, the court of

The question of whether there's a genuine issue

of fact there been disputed, had there been some dispute

as to what the arresting officers knew at the time of the

arrest, the appellate court would have to have some

factual basis for resolving the question of whether there

was probable cause or whether a reasonable officer would

have believed probable cause to exist, and the question

then is, is the court stuck with what the district court

said about whether there's a genuine issue of material

fact, or may the appellate court make its own

an issue of law to be applied to the facts, and the

question is, what facts should the Court assume in

deciding that question of law?

looking to what the officers knew, you have to say, what

would be perverse to say that they can't do it where the
