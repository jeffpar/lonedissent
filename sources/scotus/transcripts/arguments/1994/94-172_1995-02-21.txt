ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MORRIS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. MORRIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns the applicability of title

12

18, United States Code, section 1001, often referred to as

13

the false statement statute, to statements of the

14

petitioner made in the course of bankruptcy court

15

proceedings.

16

making of knowingly false statements in any matter within

17

the jurisdiction of any department of the United States.

18

Our position is essentially twofold.

Section 1001, of course, prohibits the

If there

19

is an honest debate over whether the term "department"

20

includes the courts, then the Rule of Lenity requires

21

resolution of that ambiguity in favor of the accused, and

22

secondly and alternatively, the petitioner seeks this

23

Court's approval of the judicial function exception to

24

1001 and/or related limitations placed upon section 1001

25

by the various courts of appeals that have reached this

issue.

2

Very briefly, the petitioner's three convictions

3

under section 1001 arose from three written responses made

4

through counsel during the course of the bankruptcy

5

proceedings.

6

trustee as a result of inquiries made by that trustee.

These responses were made to the bankruptcy

7

The first two convictions arose from answers to

8

the bankruptcy trustee's complaint, and essentially those
answers consisted of the words,

10

that the allegations in the complaint are untrue."
The third conviction arose as a result of a

11
12

discovery dispute.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MORRIS:

These answers were verified?
The third conviction arose as a

result of a discovery dispute.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. MORRIS:

None of these answers were verified?
No, they were not.

The answer to

18

the complaint was signed by counsel and signed by the

1

petitioner, but not under oath, and the discovery response

20

was not signed by the petitioner at all, only signed by

21

counsel.

22

The discovery response arose as a result of the

23

trustee asking for the production of certain documents

24

from the petitioner, and the discovery response filed by

25

counsel stated that the petitioner had turned over those

documents to the prior trustee.
Later on in the bankruptcy court proceedings,

3

the bankruptcy judge issued an order directing the

4

petitioner to turn over those documents, and they were

5

turned over.

6

for 1001 as a result of that response in the discovery

7

issue, and that comprised the third of the three

8

convictions.

9

Nevertheless, the petitioner was indicted

First, I would like to address the question that

10

the determination of whether 1001 applies at all to the

11

courts is a question that logically and necessarily

12

precedes the determination of whether the judicial

13

function exception applies to 1001.

14

just fairly included within the question presented for

15

review, it is a necessary predicate to a determination of

16

the propriety of the judicial function exception.

QUESTION:

Congress

Congress did not --

Well, Bramblett stands in your way.

Do you say we have to overrule Bramblett?
MR. MORRIS:

It is, Your Honor, dictum in

22

Bramblett that stands in our way, and for that reason, we

23

do not believe that the Court will run into the problem of

24

stare decisis, as the Government would suggest.

25

decisis, of course, carries particular weight in a

2

the Government suggests it should carry in this case,

3

because, of course, we are addressing dictum, and we have

4

asked the Court to recede from the dictum in Bramblett - -

5
6

QUESTION:

Well, it certainly has been followed

in the intervening years, hasn't it?

7

MR. MORRIS:

Well, the courts of appeals,

8

because of Bramblett, have felt constrained to hold that

9

such statement that -- to hold that 1001 applies to the

10

courts because of the dictum in Bramblett, and it is with

11

several misgivings that the courts of appeals have noted

12

that.

13

case after Bramblett was that type of case also.

14

In fact, this is one such case, and the very first

QUESTION:

What Bramblett decided, though, not

15

really by way of dictum, was that it was not limit -- 1001

16

was not limited to the executive branch.

17

MR. MORRIS:

But the issue before Bramblett,

18

Your Honor, was not a statement made to the judiciary, it

19

was a statement made to the legislative branch, and in

20

fact - -

21

QUESTION:

Yes, but once you say it doesn't

22

apply to the -- it's not limited to the executive branch

23

but it extends to the legislative branch, it seems to me

24

it's very hard to carve out of the statute a meaning that

25

says, it covers executive and legislative but not

MR. MORRIS:

2

But nevertheless, that is what the

3

statute says.

4

word,

5

"department" for us in title 18, section 6, and that

6

definition of department is the executive departments, and

7

it was explained in the reviser's notes to that definition

8

of department.

9

The plain language of the statute uses the

"department," and Congress has defined the term,

I'm sorry?
What about Congress?

Is Congress

within that definition?

15

What about Congress?

No, it states that -Well, there goes your plain language

argument out the window.
QUESTION:

Bramblett held that it was applicable

to Congress, didn't it?
MR. MORRIS:

And we are asking, even if you are

19

looking at the holding of Bramblett, if the holding of

20

Bramblett is deemed at issue, we're asking the Court to

21

recede from the holding of Bramblett.

QUESTION:

So you're not really talking just

about dicta.
MR. MORRIS:

Well, technically, yes, we are,

because Bramblett did not involve - - in the sense that

Bramblett did not involve a statement to the judiciary,

distinction between the legislature and the judiciary for

4

the purposes of examining Bramblett, then yes, indeed,

5

we're asking the Court to recede from the holding as well.

If the Court finds that there's no principal

QUESTION:

6

Well, there is certainly no principal

7

distinction for purposes of making a plain language

8

argument.

MR. MORRIS:
QUESTION:

10
11

Well, there isn't -If you want to make a plain language

argument, you must ask us to overrule Bramblett.
MR. MORRIS:

12

Yes, and Bramblett runs counter to

13

the plain language argument and to the definition supplied

14

by Congress of the term "department."

overrule?
MR. MORRIS:

Yes, overrule, if we're going to

21

view it as the holding of Bramblett is at issue, but

22

recede if we're going to view Bramblett as only standing

23

in the way of the petitioner's argument as far as the

24

dictum is concerned.

QUESTION:

Do you attach any significance to the

1

fact that Bramblett was not just any statement to Congress

2

but rather was in support of a claim made to the

3

disbursing office of the Congress?

4

MR. MORRIS:

Yes, and that carries particular

5

significance in drawing the distinctions between

6

administrative and adjudicative functions that have been

7

drawn in the judicial function exception.

8

9

If we are to understand why the courts of
appeals have had such widespread acceptance of the

10

judicial function exception and the justification for the

11

distinction drawn between housekeeping functions and

12

adjudicate functions, all we need to do is look at

13

Bramblett and see why that happened.

14

And the Second Circuit in the Masterpol

15

decision, when that circuit adopted the judicial function

16

exception, probably set forth the most cogent explanation

17

of that distinction, and the Masterpol decision stated

18

that in viewing Bramblett and what it was limited to, it

19

was limited to a statement made to the disbursing office.

20

It was limited to the legislature as far as administrative

21

function was concerned.

22

And, therefore, Masterpol said the reason why

23

the courts of appeals are justified in drawing this

24

judicial function exception is so that Bramblett applies

25

to the legislature in the same way that 1001 will apply to

the judiciary, only insofar as the administrative

2

functions of the courts are concerned, so in that

3

respect - -

4

QUESTION:

5

for that distinction.

6

MR. MORRIS:

7

QUESTION:

There is no textual basis, though,
You agree with that, I take it?
Well -I mean, that's a nice way to draw a

8

line, but it doesn't reflect anything that's written in

9

the statute.

10

Isn't that fair to say?

MR. MORRIS:

No, but the courts -- yes, it's

11

fair to say, but the courts of appeals felt that that was

12

a justified interpretation of the statute, because

13

Congress never intended that that statute would apply to

14

statements such as those made by the petitioner in this

15

case, or certainly not to every misrepresentation made in

16

every Federal court.

17

QUESTION:

But, counsel, if similar statements

18

had been made before an ALJ, for example, an

19

administrative adjudicator, then you recognize that that

20

would certainly be covered?

applicability of 1001 as well, because that is an

So you say adjudicative functions

Well -There's nothing like that in the

made.

argument can be made for that.

MR. MORRIS:

1

I would rely upon what all the

2

circuits have held, and that is that 1001 was -- there is

no indication of congressional intent that 1001 would have

that broad scope, that there have to be some limitations,

Is there any -- once we get away from

the plain language, is there any rationale for keeping the

courts out but keeping the administrative adjudicators in?

rationale of the judicial function exception itself.

Beyond that, no.

That could be a problem in that

QUESTION:

And you would exclude congressional

adjudicative functions?

15

MR. MORRIS:

What would they be?
Well, as I stated, I think an

16

argument can be made that if it is acting in an

17

adjudicative function, that the rationale of the judicial

function exception could apply to those situations.

comparing it with the coverage that Bramblett actually

said extended to the legislative function, but without

Bramblett, I don't think there ever would have been any

effort to find a judicial exception.

MR. MORRIS:

The courts who have

argument would have prevailed in the courts of appeals

12

that Bramblett - -

13

QUESTION:

Without Bramblett you might well have

14

come up and said this applies to the executive department

15

only, but you would never say there's a judicial exception

16

that extends through the executive department as well as

17

excluding legislative and judiciary.

18

MR. MORRIS:

Well, the judicial function

19

exception, of course, is an outgrowth of the Bramblett

20

decision, and it flowed from Morgan's discussion of

21

traditional trial tactics and how those should not be

22

within the ambit of 1001, and that --

Well, Mr. Morris, let me ask you in

this case whether the false statements that were made in

the course of the bankruptcy proceeding could be punished

MR. MORRIS:

Arguably, yes.

They could have

been punished as perhaps obstruction of justice, as

11

Certainly the discovery response would subject

The perjury statute wouldn't cover

it, because they weren't under oath?
MR. MORRIS:

12

That's correct, and therein lies

13

one of the anomalies of the Government's interpretation of

14

1001.

15

Perjury, which carries a greater penalty than

16

1001, would create the anomaly that a person who makes a

17

false statement in court not under oath would be subjected

18

to a greater punishment than a person who is under oath

19

and makes a false statement, and that's the type of

20

unintended consequence that the courts of appeals were

21

concerned with in carving out the judicial function

22

exception, in particular coming to the conclusion that

23

1001 is not a boundless statute, and Congress never

24

intended it to be such.

the Court is going to approve the judicial function

functions of the Court, and if the exception is approved,

he should prevail.
There is also a related private civil --

11

sure I understood you correctly.

perjury is punished less severely than a false statement

14

MR. MORRIS:

Did you mean to say that

Well, my understanding is that the

15

perjury statute carries 5 years and $2,000, and then a

16

violation of 1001 carries 5 years and $10,000.

QUESTION:

MR. MORRIS:

You said it the other way around.

apologize.
The petitioner is also seeking relief under the

private civil litigation exception, as it is so-called,

22

from the Second Circuit's D'Amato case, which was also

23

adopted by the Eleventh Circuit in London, and those cases

held that 1001 does not apply to civil litigation where

the Government is not a party.

QUESTION:

Yes, but isn't it true that the

3

history of this statute was one of false claims against

4

the Government, usually monetary claims, and the

5

particular false statement in Bramblett was in support of

6

a monetary claim made to the disbursing officer, so isn't

7

it conceivable that one could say the holding goes only to

8

those departments of the judiciary or the legislature that

9

perform similar functions to the departments in the

10

executive branch that process claims against the

11

Government?

12

MR. BRESS:

No, Justice Stevens, and primarily

for two reasons.

carried out in Bramblett.

MR. BRESS:

Where did -- how do

In Bramblett it was argued, and the

21

Court noted, that the matter involved -- and this is on

22

page 509 of the opinion -- was within the jurisdiction of

23

the Treasury Department, and the misstatements could be

24

taken, therefore, to be misstatements to the Treasury,

25

because the money would come out of the Treasury.

That

was basically a disbursement rationale.
In other words, because the false statement

2

3

would take money from the Government, it is like false

4

claims, and the Court should approve it on that basis.
QUESTION:

5

Yes, but that -- that's what you rely

6

on for saying that it was -- you think the rationale would

apply to an unsworn statement at a committee hearing?
MR. BRESS:

8

9

Yes, and in fact the District of

Columbia Circuit held as much in the Poindexter case.
The statutory reason for that interpretation is

10
11

that the original false statement provision only went to

12

false statements made to collect payment on false claims.

13

That statute was amended, broadened to include false

14

statements to cheat, defraud, or swindle the Government.

15

When this Court in the Cohn decision interpreted

16

that phrase still only to reach monetary claims, the Court

17

deleted the purpose element entirely and substituted the

18

"in any matter" clause.

later - -

QUESTION:

21

MR. BRESS:

That clause was interpreted

The Congress did.
Congress did.

I'm sorry.

That

clause was interpreted later by the Court in United States

v. Gilliland to remove the restriction to monetary frauds

24

and to broaden the statute to false statements that might

25

pervert any authorized Government function.

That lack of a functional distinction was echoed

2

by this Court in United States v. Rodgers, where the Court

3

rejected the notion that false statements to an

4

investigatory agency -- in that case, it was the FBI and

5

the Secret Service -- would not come within the scope of

6

section 1001.

The Court held in that case that section 1001

does not make functional distinctions, and that any matter

means any matter.

It would

So why couldn't we simply say, if we think that

17

Bramblett was incorrectly decided that "department"

18

doesn't mean Congress, why couldn't we say, we will go

19

along with Bramblett insofar as it has been applied to

20

Congress, but we won't take the further step, which would

21

be logical, if you believe Bramblett was right, of

extending it to the judiciary as well?

terrible about that?

It said that the -- I mean,

know, we don't have to follow that.

12

MR. BRESS:

That approach we believe would

13

suffer the same faults as overturning the case in its

14

entirety, in the following sense.

15

regard for statutory stare decisis is based in part on

16

Congress' ability, if it does not like the holding that

17

the Court has with respect to a statute, to change the

18

statute in reaction to that holding.

The Court's special

19

Congress did not change or amend section 1001 in

20

response to this Court's decision in Bramblett, and in the

21

40 years since Bramblett was decided, this Court and the

22

lower Federal courts have based many decisions on this

Court's interpretation of the statutory language in

After the statute was amended in '34

not agree that you can read context to give any special

Whatever monetary attachment the false

The context indicating otherwise was interpreted

12

13

by this Court in Bramblett primarily to take account of

14

the evolution of the statute over time.

QUESTION:

Does the context refer literally only

16

to the words of the statute, or does the context include

17

the historical understanding behind those words?

18

For example, if you are going to apply it to the

19

judicial branch across the board, then I suppose in theory

20

a lawyer making a closing argument who allegedly

21

misrepresents facts is going to be indictable under this

22

statute.

23

Would you agree?
MR. BRESS:

If the lawyer intentionally

misrepresents facts, the lawyer may be prosecutable under

However, in a closing statement, for

1

example, the lawyer is generally not taken to be stating

2

facts that he believes exist, but rather to be summing up

3

what has gone on during the trial.

4

QUESTION:

Well, let's say that's one way --

5

there's a difference, though, between a closing argument

6

and the reference to facts there, and the factual

7

implications of entering a plea, which in fact --

8

MR. BRESS:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes.
-- is the distinction that you

recognize.
Well, when we bear in mind the fact that

11
12

historically a lawyer who is claimed to have made a

13

misrepresentation in closing argument is usually dealt

14

with by an objection, a statement by the judge saying to

15

the jury, take your own recollection of the evidence, this

16

is just argument, you don't have to accept his statement

17

of the fact, that is for you to decide.

18

Isn't that part of the context in which we

19

should determine whether the statute in fact applies, the

20

context here being that there is a settled practice for

21

dealing with these problems, and it would be rather

22

startling to assume that suddenly this settled practice

23

had been overlaid by a - - the creation of an indictable

24

offense.

you are suggesting we should consider context, or as the

MR. BRESS:

2

It might be a proper contextual

3

argument, except that we would take the position that the

4

overlap of section 1001 on top of, as you say, more

5

specific context -- for example, this is - - the trial

the legislature and also in the executive branch.

10

of the ostensible application of the statute?

MR. BRESS:

So we shouldn't do what I was

Moreover, section 1001

If section 1001 were read not to apply where a

more specific prohibition applies, you would cut the guts

out of the statute, which was intended to be a broad

statute.

Moreover, as a general matter, this Court has

never taken the position that criminal statutes ought to

be interpreted narrowly to minimize or eliminate areas of

overlap.

strong presumption against implied repeal.

14

That would, in our view, conflict with the

QUESTION:

You are supposed to interpret an

15

ambiguous statute in the direction of lenity, and why

16

isn't it ambiguous?

17

"department" means executive department unless the context

18

shows the term is intended to describe executive,

19

legislative, or judicial, and the context here would seem

20

ambiguous in respect to judicial, wouldn't it?

21

That is to say, where the term

If you look at the function of the judiciary,

22

But why isn't it at least ambiguous, given all

of the considerations that have been brought up, and then

once it's ambiguous, why can't you say, yes, executive,

call for judicial?

Well, firstly, in terms of the

context, we disagree that the context is ambiguous,

particularly if you compare it with the legislative

10

context.

make - -

12

I don't believe there is any distinction you can

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose the distinction might

13

be that people very often go to Congress -- very often --

14

in order to get money from the United States Government.

15

When they come into court, the instances of their trying

16

to get money from the United States Government, while

17

significant, is smaller, significantly smaller than the

18

instances in which they're trying to get money from

19

Congress or the executive branch.

20

MR. BRESS:

The 1934 amendment to the act was

21

passed mostly at the urging of the Department of the

22

Interior, which was concerned about falsifications of

23

statements made in connection with hot oil shipments.

24

Those false statements were not made in any respect to

take money out of the Federal Government.

The amendment to the statute at that point, and

I can't emphasize this too much, was meant to take out the

need to prove monetary fraud, and rather to reach false

To view otherwise would be contrary to this

So when I go back to the legislative

geared to take money from the Federal Government.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Bress, even if one accepts that

the concern is making false statements to the Government,

what about the distinction that the Second Circuit made in

6

D'Amato that Mr. Morris brought up at the end of his

7

argument?

8

between private parties.

That is, at lease excise civil litigation
Unlike agency adjudication,

where one of the parties is the Government, here we have
10

no Government interests being adjudicated, only private

11

parties.

12

Why shouldn't that be taken out?
MR. BRESS:

In our view, the decision of the

13

Second Circuit in D'Amato was basically a different way of

14

saying that the Second Circuit didn't agree with Bramblett

15

in the first place, because the Second Circuit was

16

essentially saying that a lie in a judicial context is

17

only going to fall within 1001 if the lie was essentially

18

to the Government as executive on the other side of the

1

case, that the lie to the court, which might pervert the

20

court's decisionmaking functions, would not fall within

21

the statute.

22

We believe that that holding is fundamentally

23

inconsistent with Bramblett, and that perversion of

24

judicial functions, just as perversion of executive or

25

legislative, falls within the statute.

intend frauds such as this, the claim for money made to

MR. BRESS:

Justice Stevens, we take the holding

in Bramblett to be that section 1001 was not intended to

be restricted to the executive branch but, rather, reach

the legislative and judicial branches.

QUESTION:

That's correct, but it doesn't

necessary mean that it covers everything that happens in

QUESTION:

Isn't one of the things that we

should worry about is not what theoretically would be

covered by this, but by the sort of interorum effect of

Take my example a moment ago of the lawyer who

7

becomes too exuberant in final argument.

8

what we ought to worry about is not merely, and perhaps

9

not at all, about the lawyer who just flatly lies to the

edge in a case against the Government and then finds

himself next week being indicted with 6 months of

litigation facing criminal penalties to follow.

Isn't that a reason for trying to trim the

There are other implications

Government's contention that disapproving or limiting
