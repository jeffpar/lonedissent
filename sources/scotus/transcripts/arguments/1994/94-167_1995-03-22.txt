ORAL ARGUMENT OF ISIDORO RODRIGUEZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the Court:
The question for the Court today is to resolve

12

the dispute between the Circuits.

13

the Attorney General's scope of employment certification

14

issued under the Westfall Act is subject to de novo

15

judicial review by the district court.

16

That is, whether or not

This action involves a simple automobile

17

accident in Barranquilla, Colombia, where an employee of

18

the Federal Government, driving at night, injured

1

Petitioners.

20

Subsequently, after two years of filing additional data to

21

the administrative body, told the statute of limitations

22

of the action was filed in ' 3.

23

to that, the attorney -- the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern

24

District of Virginia issued a one-line paragraph saying

25

that Mr. Lamagno was in fact acting within the scope of

An administrative claim was filed in ' 1.

Three months subsequent

1

his employment.
We opposed that motion in the district court,

2

3

however, based on the Fourth Circuit's ruling in Johnson

4

v. Carter, that held that there was no discretion on the

5

part of the district court but to dismiss the action and

6

substitute the United States.

7

As a result of being -- having the United States

8

substitute, the action was dismissed as a result of the

9

Foreign Claims Exemption to the Federal Torts Claims Act.

10

And this action was then filed -- a petition before this

11

Court.

12

We hold that --we believe that the Fourth

13

Circuit's decision is in error in two essential ways.

14

First, there is nothing within the Westfall Act to

15

indicate that the -- that the presumption of judicial

16

review under the Federal Drivers Act, which was the

17

underpinning of the Westfall Act, was amended.

18

all times judicial review was maintained --

19
20
21

QUESTION:

That at

Well, they did change the statutory

language, didn't they?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Yes.

Under (d)(1), Mr. Chief

22

Justice, they changed the statutory language to expand

23

what was under the Federal Drivers Act -- that is immunity

24

from suit if a Federal driver was acting within the scope

25

of employment at the time of the car accident -- to

1

encompass all Federal employees as long as they were

2

acting within the scope of their employment.
QUESTION:

3
4

And what did the Federal Drivers Act

say about judicial review?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

5

It said nothing, with the

6

exception on the issue of removal from the State court to

7

the Federal court, which permitted a challenge by the

8

individual.

9

in divers, in the Federal court.

With regard to a -- an action that was filed
It was moot.

There was

10

-- there was a presumption of judicial review, and the

11

courts followed that presumption.
And that --

12

QUESTION:

3

Well, now, now, wait a minute.

There

-- was the presumption of judicial review contained in the

5

language of the Act?

QUESTION:

No; you can answer that question yes

or no, surely.
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

QUESTION:

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

25

Specifically, no -- within the

Drivers --

I -- I -- in reviewing the

The Federal Drivers Act.

It was

not specifically black-letter law within the statute.

1

law within the statute?

2

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

3

Subsequently, the Westfall Act expanded the --

4

the ability of immunity from suit on an individual basis

5

if the Federal employee was acting within the scope of

6

employment.

7

No, Your Honor.

The reason why the -- the need for judicial

8

review is threefold.

First, without judicial review,

9

there is a question about due process.

Here we have

10

individuals who have a right of action as a result of a

11

tort action, having property damage and injuries, having

12

no opportunity to be heard as a result ofa--a--a

13

certification -- scope of employment by an administrative

14

body, who is acting both as a factfinder and, at the same

15

time, as defense of the Federal employee.

16

QUESTION:

And what is the argument that that

17

would deny due process -- this accident took place in

18

Colombia, right?

19

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

20

QUESTION:

Correct.

And you're perfectly free to sue in

21

the courts of Colombia, I take it?

22

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

No, Your Honor.

As a result of

23

sovereign immunity, Mr. Lamagno was detailed to the United

24

States Embassy, and so there is sovereign immunity from

25

suit in Colombia.

QUESTION:

1

As against him as an individual?

I

2

guess the United States I can understand that argument,

3

but suing him as an individual -- you can't sue the United

4

States --

5

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Correct.

In the United States either.
Well, you could not under

8

Colombian civil law sue him as an individual as a result

9

of his being in the service of a foreign embassy.

10

QUESTION:

With diplomatic immunity?

11

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

12

So he has -- in that capacity, there is not,

Correct.

13

within civil law -- the Civil Code of Colombia, a scope of

14

employment exception to this diplomatic immunity.

15

we're -- we're essentially without recourse under the laws

16

of Colombia.

17

QUESTION:

18

the Westfall Act was passed?

This -- this accident occurred after

19

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

22

23

And so,

Correct.

Not before?
It occurred in -- in January of

' 91.
QUESTION:

It's not as though the right to sue

24

existed and then the Act took it away.

25

the accident occurred, that this might happen.

The Act said, when

That --

1

that the Attorney General might, in -- in effect, say you

2

can't sue this individual?

3

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Correct.

So why is that a denial of due

process?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Well, because essentially, even

7

under the Federal Drivers Act you had a right to challenge

8

the issue of the scope of employment to determine whether

9

in fact at the time --

10
11
12

3
4

QUESTION:

Yes, but they changed that before

this accident -MR. RODRIGUEZ:

That is -- that is the issue

before this Court -- whether in fact it was changed.
QUESTION:

Suppose -- suppose the Federal

5

Government says, ex ante, before -- before an accident

6

occurs, they -- they say you cannot sue personally any

7

Federal employee?

8

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

Before the accident occurs?
They just say, you know, we --

20

we have made the determination that suits against Federal

21

employees are so much trouble, they are so distracting to

22

-- to their execution of their duties that one of the

23

perquisites of Federal employment is you are to be immune

24

from civil tort suits, period?

25

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Based on that hypothetical -8

Is that a denial of -- of equal -- of

Well, it -- no, based on that

However, that -- those facts

QUESTION:

Well, this is just one step short of

6

that.

7

that the Attorney General says shall be, shall be.
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

8

9

It says not all of them will be, but only those

I think -- I think there's a

large distinction between the hypothetical you presented

10

and the facts with regard to the Westfall Act and the

11

antecedent Federal Drivers Act.

12

never designed and never attempted to remove the issue of

13

judicial review.

14
15

The Westfall Act was

This -- there is cursory legislative language in
the history of it.

16

QUESTION:

But with regard to the specific -No, wait.

I -- I'm -- I was not

17

speaking to the point of whether the Act removed judicial

18

review.

process of law.

I was speaking to your argument that if it did re

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

If it did --

And that's all I'm speaking -- yes -On your hypothetical --

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

1

No.

Based on your hypothetical,

2

I said that that would be acceptable, because there would

3

be a clear, emphatic statement on the part of Congress,

4

saying that -- that for these specific findings and these

5

specific fact situations, we will deny and we will

underwrite all Federal employees.

Now, whether or not that was

Leaving it to the Attorney General is

what -- is what causes it to be a denial of due process?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

12

Leaving both issues -- both the

13

factfinding and the defending of the -- of the -- of the

14

employee.

15

recourses for the injured parties.

16

And then, the third issue, removing all

QUESTION:

Well, before the Federal Tort Claims

17

Act, you couldn't sue the Government for -- for any injury

18

inflicted by a -- an employee acting in the course of --

19

of his employment.

20

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

But that is the issue.

Our

21

challenge is whether or not Mr. Lamagno was in fact acting

22

within the scope of his employment.

23

both at the administrative level -- where we raised the

24

challenge initially -- was some sort of impartial

25

factfinding that -- to assure that in fact he was acting

And what we requested

immunity.

Neither at the administratively level nor at the

judicial level do we have that type of impartial

factfinding.

We had this lawsuit against the

That -- that is -- that is a common law tort

10

that occurred in -- in Colombia, which we have sued

11

Mr. Lamagno in his individual capacity.
QUESTION:

12

And you say the diplomatic immunity

13

is so total that even acting outside the scope of

14

employment, it would -- there is no remedy in -- in

There would be no way of getting

Well, how can you lay venue against

him back here in the United States?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

20

Because -- because he is a

resident of Virginia.

He is a -- he works out of the --

QUESTION:

And was -- was he served with process

in the action?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

We served process both on -- on

the Agency head and also on -- on the Agency in his name,

5

which was accepted.

6

QUESTION:

Well, was it -- yes, but I -- this is

collateral, but I -- I doubt that they could accept

8

service for him personally, could they?

10
11

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Well, they --we never received

it back to our process server, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

You -- you sued him personally based

12

on all-purpose jurisdiction, you sued him where he

13

resided, his all-purpose forum where he resided?

14

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

You said you would be left without a

16

remedy, but isn't there some kind of administrative

17

proceeding ongoing before the DEA?

18

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Theoretically there is an

19

administrative process.

But if the -- if Lamagno's

20

grandchildren get to a certain age, I'm certain that they

21

will be able to deal with that, because here we are four

22

years down the road, a simple car accident, and DEA has

23

the -- has not responded in any fashion other than -- I

24

should say -- DEA -- the Torts Division of the Justice

25

Department, because it was transferred from DEA to the

Although they have requested mountains of

2
3

documentation, both medical reports and other -- other

4

information, they never have responded during this

5

four-year course as to what the status of this action

6

would be.

7

QUESTION:

Could you tell me a little bit more

8

about your due process argument?

What's -- what line of

9

authority -- what precedents from this Court do you cite

10

in support of the proposition that there is a denial of

11

due process when the certification by the Government

12

deprives your client of a cause of action?

13

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Well, the -- the -- the line of

14

reason from this Court starts out that there is a property

15

right in a common law action.

16

Petrousky v. United States in the Second Circuit, and

17

reaffirmed there.

18

right, in order to deprive them of the property right, you

19

have to have due process.

QUESTION:

That's been supported in

And that, once you have that property

And what's your -- your closest case

in point from this Court?

But this statute was passed before the cause of action

It's a fine argument when

But --

There was no cause of action expected

or anticipated, except one that was subject to this
Attorney General's specification.
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

But that's only if you abide by

12

the analysis that when the Westfall Act was passed, it was

designed to remove judicial review.

support that -- that assertion.

QUESTION:

There is nothing to

that the Attorney General would certify that the

but simply said, if the Attorney General says, no cause of

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

QUESTION:

The same problem.

7

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

The issue of bias by the

factfinder is one of the key ingredients of -- of -- of

this particular case.

Because here you have the person

who is the supervisor of the employee, if you will, making

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The position of the United States is that under

behest of a tort plaintiff.

concluded that the scope certification is subject to

The large majority of courts

judicial review.

21

the Westfall Act and with the strong presumption that

22

administrative action is judicially reviewable.

23

That view is consistent with the text of

Moreover, to permit judicial review of the

Attorney General's scope certification does not render the

First, the text of the Act does not definitively

2

resolve the interpretive question that this case presents.

3

Respondent, in his amicus, placed principal reliance on

4

the statute's use of the word "shall."

5

Carter, the predecessor Fourth Circuit case to this one,

6

the Fourth Circuit also concluded that the word "shall"

reflected an unambiguous congressional intent to preclude

review of the certification.

What is the basis for jurisdiction

4

MR. STEWART:

And that's the

But as a constitutional matter, it's certainly

clear that Congress may provide a Federal forum when the

cause of action arises under State law, but if a viable or

11

colorable Federal defense is asserted -- as this Court

12

said in Mesa v. California.

13

And essentially, we read 2679 (d)(2) to reflect

14

a congressional determination that where the Attorney

remains colorable.

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think, as Mr. Kellogg has

pointed out in his brief, there is a divergence of opinion

5

among the Circuits as to the factors to be taken into

6

account in certifying and the factors to be taken into

account in judicial review.

8

dispute pertains to the question of whether the

plaintiffs' allegations should be taken as true in making

And at least on some occasions, the Attorney

12

13

General will base her -- or her designee -- will base the

14

scope determination on the view that the acts, as alleged

15

in the complaint, are within the scope.

16

The district court may disagree with that

determination -- may determine that if the facts, as

alleged, were proved to a tee, the defendant employee

would be acting with the -- outside of his scope of

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

It certainly --

Couldn't it?

MR. STEWART:

In this case there is, 21 U.S.C.

11

Mr. Rodriguez referred -- doesn't apply across the board.

It says that, notwithstanding the foreign tort exception,

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

3

It's

Why don't you protect defendants from

you?

4

MR. STEWART:

There is certainly something

5

unusual about the Department of Justice affirmatively

6

asserting the position that one of its acts is judicially

7

reviewable.

8

here today.

9

And I think there are two reasons that we are

The first is that the Court has often stressed

10

that there is a strong presumption in favor of judicial

11

review of executive action; that that presumption is

12

overcome only in very unusual circumstances; and,

13

consequently, we feel an obligation not to assert a

14

non-reviewability argument unless there are compelling

15

reasons for it.

16

The second is that during congressional

17

consideration of the bill that became the Westfall Act, we

18

represented to Congress our view that under the Act, the

19

scope certification would be judicially reviewable.

20

That's not binding us on it, but I think the Department is

So, what kind of a certification is

entered then?

Do you say, I certify the employee was

acting within the employment, but it didn't happen, or

what do you do?
MR. STEWART:

6

Well, typically, the certification

7

itself would be a fairly sparse document.

A certification

would simply say something to the effect of this on; that

4

either a memorandum in support of the notion of notice of

substitution or an affidavit that would flesh out the

basis for the conclusion.

7

I think here we had something of a truncated

proceeding because the scope certification was undertaken

9

immediately after the Fourth Circuit's decision in Johnson

MR. MALONEY:

"Should a United States district

QUESTION:

But now 2679 (d) just talks about on

a motion to remand, doesn't it?
MR. MALONEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

it clearly articulates that the United States District

QUESTION:

Yes.

But on a motion to remand.

at least the Westfall Act seems to set out several

12

different sections.

differently a motion to remand and the simple

determination of whether a suit shall proceed.

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

But the stat -- the subsection here goes on to

17

say, when there's not an available remedy against the

18

United States, which implies that what they're talking

19

about is where the district court found that the

20

certification for some reason was invalid, or that a

21

district court found that the employee was not acting in

22

the scope of his employment, and therefore had the ability

23

to remand that case to the State court.

MR. MALONEY:

Well, it's -- it's -- it's not for

I believe that's -- that Congress was

pretty clear on that, Justice O'Connor, in making a

5

balancing test between the rights of plaintiffs and the

6

rights of Federal employees.

7

And as this Court noted in the Smith case that

was cited by my adversary, Congress gave less solicitude

for plaintiffs' rights in passing this Act.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL K. KELLOGG

9

BY INVITATION OF THE COURT, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

10
11

12

13

MR. KELLOGG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The only part of the language or structure of

14

the Westfall Act that the Government is able to rely on at

15

all to try to undermine the mandatory language of the

16

statute is subsection (d)(2), which says that

17

certification shall be conclusive for purposes of removal.

18

The United States tries to argue that the implication of

19

that provision is that it's not conclusive for purposes of

20

substitution.

21

There are several reasons why that implication

22

doesn't hold.

First of all, as Mr. Maloney pointed out,

23

it does not change the mandatory language used in the rest

24

of the statute that says the United States shall be

25

substituted, period.

The only condition precedent for substitution

1
2

listed in the statute is certification.

It's the only

3

event that the district court is charged with determining.

4

The second reason the implication doesn't hold

5

is that it's counterbalanced by subsection (d)(3), which

6

says that if the Attorney General does not certify, then

7

the plaintiff can seek a certification from the court that

8

he was in fact acting within the scope of the employment.

MR. KELLOGG:

Is it not correct that in that case

he can get the -- a State judge to review the United

States Attorney General's refusal to certify?

MR. KELLOGG:

No.

Because the statute in,

8

(d)(3), allows the United States to remove it to Federal

9

court.
QUESTION:

20

No, I'm thinking in cases in which

21

the United States refused to certify -- the (d)(3)

22

situation.

23

MR. KELLOGG:

That's correct.

Then the

24

defendant petitions for certification.

25

then removes the case to Federal court under (d)(3).

And

1

a Federal court judge will make that determination.
And then, if he rules against the defendant --

2

3

says he was acting outside the scope of employment -- the

4

case is remanded to State court.
But by providing a specific provision that says

5
6

certification is reviewable at the behest of the

7

defendant, with no corresponding provision saying it's

Learned Hand, people -- plaintiffs could sue Government

employees, but they couldn't recover if it was within the

scope of their employment; right?
Then this Court, in Westfall, limited that;

MR. KELLOGG:

decided by a judge and a jury.

I'm not sure that's correct to say

That's correct.

Mr. Kellogg, could you say something

about the -- the due process argument?

I mean the

arguments made that we should interpret "shall" to mean

something other than "shall" because of the constitutional

MR. KELLOGG:

Is there a constitutional

I think

your answer, quite frankly, was -- was perfectly correct

May I ask one question about the word

can leave the statute with all the "shalls" that are in it

QUESTION:

I mean you --

QUESTION:

I wondered about a different

5

But there's a line of cases in this Court that talk about

a constitutional separation of powers problem that arises

when you take a common variety -- common, garden variety

13

Now, here -- here, in fact, even in Crowell &

Benson, you could take a common variety tort action and

15

give it to an administrator because there was judicial

review of that administrator's decision.

17

Now, here,

I take it, you would be taking a

common, garden variety tort action, handing it not to --

19

really, over to the Attorney General to decide, and there

20

would be no judicial review of that Attorney General's

21

decision on that common, garden variety tort action.

22

Now, what I wonder is, doesn't that raise some

23

kind of constitutional problem under Shore, Crowell &

employment is itself under the common law generally

regarded as an admission or a ratification of the acts of

that employee.

8

9
10

I think the key point here is that the

I know of no separation of powers or due process
problem in allowing an employer to ratify or acknowledge
scope of employment on behalf of its employee.

11

Now, ordinarily, of course, under the common

12

law, the plaintiff could then proceed against both the

13

defendant employee and the employer who admits

14

responsibility --

QUESTION:

The reason being that the admission

was adverse to the dec -- declarant's interest.

17

MR. KELLOGG:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct.

But here -- but here, the -- the

19

admission is taken as defeating a cause of action, say, in

20

a State court with a jury trial for a malicious act.

21

MR. KELLOGG:

That is precisely what this Court,

22

in United States v. Smith acknowledged was the result of

23

the Westfall Act, and the intent of Congress.

24

when it cuts off a ordinary, common law tort action

25

against the employee and against the United States, it is

That even

that isn't so here.

an assumption as to how the statutory scheme worked.

QUESTION:

2

Do you think a certification is

3

reviewable somehow under the Administrative Procedure Act,

4

the final Agency action?
MR. KELLOGG:

5

I -- I don't think so, Justice

6

Scalia, because this statute really sort of occupies the

7

field, and sets up its own standards for how the

8

determination is made.

9

10

Besides which, I -- I view this

the Attorney General.
QUESTION:

11

What are the standards -- you said --

12

you just used the words, set up standards for how the

13

determination is made.

14

Attorneys all over make these certifications or not.

15

there guidelines for them?

16

MR. KELLOGG:

As I understand it, the U.S.

I was unable to find any.

I

any.

19

QUESTION:

So we don't even know if there's any

20

uniformity in the way these certifications are being

21

handed out, do we?

22

MR. KELLOGG:

That's correct.

But we do know

23

that under the United States' view, scope of employment in

24

this case would be determined under the law of Colombia,

25

which would lead to all sorts of problems as to whether a

1

Federal agent is acting within the scope of his Federal

2

employment.
It would make considerably more sense to have

3
4

that determination made by the Attorney General or

5

delegated to a U.S. Attorney, to try to determine some

8

country he happens to be in.
QUESTION:

0

Is it not conceivable that apart from

this procedure, apart from challenging it when -- when the

11

-- when the certification is made to -- to the court that

12

has the tort action, might there not be an action against

3

the -- let's suppose an Attorney General who is -- or a

4

U.S. Attorney who is making these certifications just

5

randomly, just in order to help both the employee at no

expense to the Government, without any investigation

7

whatever -- is there a possibility of a separate action

8

under the Administrative Procedure Act to get that -- to

9

get that decision overturned?

20

MR. KELLOGG:

21

QUESTION:

Well, I think --

You'd have a different standard to

review.

23

would simply determine whether -- whether the -- the U.S.

QUESTION:

Which would be quite different from

what -- what -- what is -- what is asked for here.
MR. KELLOGG:

True.

I think as -- as an initial

matter, there would be potentially Rule 11 sanctions in

5

the court., where the Attorney General or the U.S. Attorney

6

makes this certification.

7

I mean it is not something that the Attorney

General or the U.S. Attorney is likely to take lightly.

Because they do have to go into court.

They do have to

10

say, we've looked into these circumstances.

It's a representation to the court that

QUESTION:

If it's not -- if it's not reviewable

by the court, how does the court get into it at all for

purposes of Rule 11 sanctions?

18

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, in -- in many instances,

you'll find where a particular side wins the argument, but

20

still could be subject to Rule 11 sanctions for

21

misrepresenting some aspect.
