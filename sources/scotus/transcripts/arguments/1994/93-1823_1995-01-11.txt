ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. MUNICH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MUNICH:

8

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
10

This 17-year-old desegregation case involves a

11

remedy of unprecedented breadth and unparalleled expense.

12

One of the remedy's central aims is to lure nonminority

13

children from the suburbs to the district for the express

14

purpose of altering the racial balance within the Kansas

15

City School District.

16

In pursuit of this so-called desegregative

17

attractiveness goal and the companion objective of

18

suburban comparability, one of the orders at issue here

1

today requires the State of Missouri to prove that a

20

quality education component of the remedy has produced

21

improved student achievement.

22

In the other orders at issue today, the lower

23

courts have also ruled that the State must fund salary

24

increases for noninstructional personnel of the KCMSD,

25

again premised on the same goals of suburban comparability

and desegregative attractiveness.
These rulings, and the underlying goals that

2

3

motivate them, far exceed the scope of the violation found

4

in this case.

5

case may proceed to unitary status in a proper and orderly

6

fashion.

7

They must be corrected to ensure that the

We start off with the proposition that the core

8

mandate in one of these cases is to eliminate the racially

9

identifiable schools from the district.

That has been the

10

focus since Green, and carried through in Dowell and

11

Freeman.
That test looks to whether the resources and the

12

13

students in the district have been allocated in a race-

14

neutral fashion to the extent possible, to the extent

15

practicable.

16

been done to ensure that students are assigned to schools

17

on an equitable basis, and that resources are assigned to

18

schools --

19

In other words, has everything practically

QUESTION:

Mr. Munich, there was an order

20

entered by the district court, I take it, requiring

21

improved student achievement?

22

MR. MUNICH:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
And I take it from the questions

24

presented in the petition for certiorari in this case that

25

we are not asked to review the propriety of that order?

2

Justice O'Connor --

3

QUESTION:

What we are asking the Court to do,

Isn't that right?

I mean, that -- we

4

are not asked to review whether that order was proper or

5

not?
MR. MUNICH:

6

At the outset, that's correct,

7

Justice O'Connor.

What we are asking the Court to do,

8

though, is to examine today, in light of the State's --

9

the posture of this case for unitary status, whether the

10

goals that the lower courts have held the State to are

11

proper today, and those goals are what we view as the

12

interdistrict goals of suburban comparability and -QUESTION:

13

You know, I thought we were here to

14

review whether the State, as opposed to the school

15

district, should have partial unitary status.

16

thought that was really the question before us, and

17

whether the courts below examined the proper factors and

18

made the proper determination on that issue.

19

right?
MR. MUNICH:

20
21
22

I mean, I

Is that

That's correct, Justice O'Connor,

and we - QUESTION:

Because much in your brief seemed to

23

go quite beyond that and reach back to the validity of the

24

order that was initially entered.

25

MR. MUNICH:

I think the posture of this case,

Justice O'Connor, is very similar to what the Court

2

confronted in Spangler.

3

orders and goals set for minority to majority transfers

4

and racial balances and all of that.

5

that -- and when it took the case, it would not review the

6

validity of those goals back then, but it would look to

7

the validity of those goals in 1974, when the district had

8

asked to be relieved of the order.

9

There, there had been initial

The Court said

We are asking for the same thing here.

We are

10

not saying that everything that has already happened needs

11

to be undone, but what we are saying is that the goals

12

that are still extant in these orders, these interdistrict

13

goals, go beyond the scope of the violation here, and when

14

we are being held, when the State of Missouri is being

15

held to those goals, that the Court must look at those in

16

the context of the question of whether partial unitary

17

status should be ordered and what the standards are, more

18

importantly.

19

QUESTION:

Do you take the position that the

20

measurement of student achievement is irrelevant in

21

determining whether the goals have been met?

22

MR. MUNICH:

We do, Your Honor.

For the purpose

23

of unitary status there's no question about that.

24

believe that if one --

MR. MUNICH:

2

We don't think it is relevant, Your

3

Honor, for these reasons.

4

Green factors that the Court has historically looked at

deals with facilities -QUESTION:

6

First off, the traditional

Well, the Green -- you -- I take it

7

you would accept the proposition that the Green factors

8

are not exclusive?
MR. MUNICH:

9

Your Honor, we think that they may

10

not be completely exclusive.

11

they - QUESTION:

12

13

However, we think that

Well, that means they're not

exclusive.

14

MR. MUNICH:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MUNICH:

That's correct, Your Honor -Okay.
-- but we do think they focus on

17

allocation of resources and not what you get after you do

18

that, and we think the reason --

19

QUESTION:

That's right.

They may, indeed, so

20

focus, but if it is appropriate to look at some point to

21

educational offerings as being a goal, ultimate or

22

intermediate, then why is it irrelevant to look to the

23

measurement of whether those educational offerings are

24

having any effect or not?

We think for this reason, Justice

2

things the district court looked at in Freeman, and it

3

looked at whether resources had been allocated, textbooks,

4

faculty assignments, were teachers biased, the good

5

teachers, the better quality teachers biased in favor of

6

the white schools or the black schools, and those are the

7

types of things that we believe can be looked at.
But when we're talking about how the student

10

story, and for this reason.

11

about a school district that makes assignments, that is

12

asked to basically allocate resources to eliminate racial

13

identifiability in the schools, it can do that by

14

executing a change in policy.

16

that the athletic league shall henceforth be unified, it

17

happens.

18

On the one hand, when we talk

If it says, the boundary
If it says

On the other hand, when we are talking about how

19

a student does, those inputs that the school board

20

introduces are filtered through individual students and

21

their individual talents, volitions --

QUESTION:

Even if it happened, then, even if

23

there were a remarkable increase in achievement level,

24

that, too, would be irrelevant, that it doesn't matter,

6

resources are allocated, we're not -- the State should not

7

be let off the hook because scores have gone up for some

8

reason.

9

We're not trying to have both sides of the pie,

If resources are not allocated equally, if there is

QUESTION:

I'm glad that you've clarified that,

10

that it's irrelevant either way, and I would also be

11

helped if you could point to the precise part of the

12

district court's order that you're challenging, because

13

there seems to be some confusion.

14

Two of the members of the dedicated panel on the

15

Eighth Circuit thought that there was no order that

increased test scores were required.

the judges gave on rehearing.

I'm sure you're

It was that test scores

So where -- and those two judges also said

21

nothing in the district court's opinion said otherwise, so

22

where do you find this order that there must be an

23

improvement in the scores?

25

MR. MUNICH:

One of the problems here, of

course, Justice Ginsburg, is the fact that the district

1

court did not directly address the State's partial unitary

2

status in the order that it issued on June 17, 1992.

3

What the court of appeals did when it examined

4

the State's claims on appeal was, it looked not only at

5

that order, but it also looked at several other orders to

6

try to ascertain from those whether the district court had

7

properly analyzed the State's Freeman arguments, the

8

unitary -- partial unitary status argument.

9

It looked, for example -- this is in the

10

petition appendix at page 131, where the district court

11

relied on national norms in another order.

12

April 16th, '93 order.

13

QUESTION:

That's the

But why shouldn't we take it as the

14

law of the case that nothing in the district court's

15

opinion so required, that what was said with regard to

16

test scores is that there is a factor in the equation?

17

MR. MUNICH:

Well, Your Honor, we would -- it's

18

certainly unclear, as you point out, whether it is a --

19

whether the panel meant it is a factor or a controlling

20

factor, but we think that the State's view is that either

21

way it should not be considered on the question of whether

22

unitary status is at hand, that the whole point of looking

23

at whether unitary status is at hand is a question of

24

whether, again, the resources within the district have

25

been allocated properly.

The Eighth Circuit standard,

1

even if we read it narrowly as simply a relevant factor,

2

we think does an injustice to that standard.
QUESTION:

3

You say it is not a relevant factor,

4

and that if all other factors have been satisfied but this

5

one hasn't, and therefore that's the sole basis why you're

6

denied the unitary status, that's wrong?
MR. MUNICH:

7
8

We think that's wrong, Justice

Scalia.
QUESTION:

9

Aren't you retreating from your

10

answer to me a moment ago?

You agreed that the Green

11

factors were not exclusive.

12

the position that nothing but allocation of resources,

13

which I take to be a Green factor enumeration, is

14

relevant.

15

that may be relevant than that.

16

MR. MUNICH:

You seem to be coming back to

You conceded a moment ago that there is more

Justice Souter, let me make sure

17

that I'm -- that my answer on that is clear.

18

things other than faculty assignments, extracurricular

19

activities, facilities, which are among the traditional

20

Green factors.

21

allocation of textbooks, allocation of computers, per

22

capita spending -- in Freeman, of course, there was some

23

question whether per capita spending among students had

24

been equalized.

25

There may be

Those things may include, we think,

considered.

In our view, they are probably subsumed

2

within the six Green factors as they exist, but we would

3

say --we would concede that allocation issues, when we're

4

talking about resources, are things that Green looks to,

5

but that - QUESTION:

6

Do we somehow blind ourselves to the

7

forest for the trees, here, because the forest is the

8

elimination of the vestiges of the prior de jure

9

discrimination, and it seems to me that the argument

10

you're making is that we ignore the forest for the trees,

11

and by and large the trees are the Green trees?
MR. MUNICH:

12

13

I don't think that would be the

result, Justice Souter.

14

QUESTION:

Where, then, in your analysis, is

15

there room to consider the -- sort of the ultimate

16

question of the elimination of vestiges?

17

MR. MUNICH:

We think that the elimination of

18

vestiges, to the extent practical, comes about by the

19

allocation, by - - first by the allocation of equal

20

resources, and -QUESTION:

21

22

Well, isn't one of the original evils

of a segregated system substandard academic performance?

23

MR. MUNICH:

If that has been found in a proper

24

case, Justice Kennedy, that is correct, and that gets us

25

to what - 12

QUESTION:

1

2

And you would not challenge that

finding in this case, as I understand it.
MR. MUNICH:

3

We're not saying that that's a

4

clearly erroneous finding.

We are challenging the legal

5

sufficiency of it, Justice Souter.
But to get back to your question, Justice

6

7

Kennedy, we think that -- our view is that one of the

8

inherent flaws that has guided the lower courts below is a

9

commingling of the analysis, of the analyses as to

10

whether, 1) whether unitary status is at hand, measured by

11

the Green factors, and as I say, we look --we believe

12

that fairly looks to whether resources have been allocated

13

equally.

14

The point that Your Honor makes I think is the

15

second point, which is namely, are there some sort of

16

educational deficits that the de jure system have visited

17

upon minority students?

18

and that, of course, is Milliken II.

19

The problem, we think, is that --

The problem, we think, is that the courts below

20

have not - - have failed to distinguish between those two

21

components of the remedy, and that is why - - of the

22

analysis, and that is why we have rather skewed tests as

23

to when the remedy should end, rather skewed goals here as

24

to what must be attained, and what we view, in essence, as

25

an open-ended remedy.

QUESTION:

1

I assume that if you have

2

nondiscriminatory input, teachers and textbooks and so

3

forth, for a certain period of time, for long enough, that

4

every student who is currently in the school system has

5

not been subjected to lower input.

6

possible that any of the lower achievement is a vestige of

7

discrimination, isn't that right?

8

MR. MUNICH:

9

QUESTION:

Then it could not be

That's correct, Justice Scalia.
And for how long has that compliance

10

with the equal input requirement existed in this school

11

system?

12

MR. MUNICH:

In this case the initial

13

Milliken II, the compen -- what the parties refer to here

14

as the Milliken II components were implemented in the

15

beginning of 1985, '86.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. MUNICH:

18

QUESTION:

'85,

'86?

That's right, Justice Scalia.
So at least at the grammar school

19

level, through eighth grade, there's nobody in that system

20

that hasn't had equal input?

21

MR. MUNICH:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

22

The other thing I should point out is that before the

23

remedy was entered in this case, the Kansas City District,

24

beginning in 1977, implemented its own voluntary student

25

reassignment policy.

It was a massive effort.

It

1

transferred -- involved the transfer of some 16,000 of the

2

school district's 41,000 students.
It used noncontiguous zoning, clustering,

3
4

pairing, a lot of the same types of things that were --

5

procedures and remedies that were used throughout the

6

South to desegregate heavily segregated school districts.

7

That has been going on since 1977 in this district.
QUESTION:

8

9

Mr. Munich, then you're saying that

the Government was inaccurate in telling us, as they did

10

in their brief, that in 1985 you joined -- the State

11

joined in urging the district court to order programs that

12

would increase student level achievements at both the

13

elementary and secondary level, so apparently in 1985 you

14

thought that there was not the required upgrading of the

15

system.

16

MR. MUNICH:

After liability was ordered --

17

found here, Justice Ginsburg, the court ordered the

18

parties to come forward with plans, and the court made it

19

very clear that what it wanted was plans that would be

20

addressed to student achievement.

21

came forward with such plans.

22

The State, of course,

I should add, though, that the point here is

23

that on two occasions at least the State challenged

24

whether those compensatory plans, or those remedial plans,

25

could be applied in a system-wide fashion such as we have

here, and that -QUESTION:

But there is no -- I'm trying to

3

determine the basis for your saying that everything was up

4

to snuff in 1985, because it seems the district court

5

didn't think so, and from what the Government represents

6

about the State's position, even the State didn't think

7

that in 1985 you were in full compliance.

8

9

MR. MUNICH:

Our position is not, Justice

Ginsburg, that we were -- that the district was fully

10

equalized as of 1985.

11

compensatory or remedial programs began.

12

That's when the programs, these

The point that I may have been unclear on was

13

that prior to that, at least in the student assignment

14

arena, there had been massive changes going on.

15

QUESTION:

I thought in '85 the district court

16

was not trying to equalize all of the schools in the

17

district, but was rather trying to have a level of input,

18

and of accomplishment, that made that district better than

19

all the surrounding districts.

20

MR. MUNICH:

21

QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice Scalia.
Wasn't that the purpose for the

22

additional upgrading that you agreed to, not necessarily

23

assume that all these schools within the district were

24

equal, but rather, to make this district better than the

25

ones around it so it would attract new students?

MR. MUNICH:

1

That's correct, Justice Scalia, and

2

that's where we parted ways with the district court.

3

had the view back then, and still take the view, that to

4

the extent there were identifiable victims of the de jure

5

system who had suffered educational deficits, that

6

Milliken II, of course, makes clear that something

2

but we do not think today in 1995 that the Court can

3

properly examine the question of unitary status in this

4

case without looking at those unitary goals.
Indeed, the Eighth Circuit, when it analyzed our

appeal in this case, said that it had to look at those

7

goals to ensure whether we had been held to them properly

8

or not, and the Eighth Circuit did in fact go back, and

9

one of the things it did was look at whether the goals of

10

desegregative attractiveness and suburban comparability

11

had been met.
And, in fact, even the Jenkins respondents

12

13

argued in their brief at page 25 that the State had the

14

burden below of proving that the quality of education

15

programs had achieved their remedial goals, so we think,

in fact, that it would be examining this question, this

in this case is, that one of the effects of the prior de

The argument that we are making, which is
consistent with this Court's precedent in Swann and

Milliken II and, indeed, in all its school desegregation

jurisprudence, is that a district court has to have

12

flexibility in fashioning a desegregation remedy, and in

13

the process of doing so, it certainly can continue -- can

14

consider test scores as one among many factors as to

15

whether or not the violation has been remedied, but it

2

Well, what sort of plan would solve

that problem?
MR. SHAW:

3

Well, I think in part the answer is

4

that if the plan as it is working now continues to succeed

5

in attracting white patients back into the district, that

6

would undercut the stigma that has been attached to the

7

school district in which whites were not enrolled and as a

consequence they wouldn't fund the district, and it may be

possible to get on a better footing with respect to local

ought to be just the other way around.

There are difficult questions with respect to

MR. BENDER:

National norms would not be - -

7

right.

National norms are not the right test.

I think if

8

you're going to do that kind of comparison, which is one

9

way, and I think if the comparison showed that they were

10

comparable, that they were about the same, you could

11

easily conclude that the results of segregation had been

12

gone.
Another thing you can look at is, you would

13
14

expect that if the educational performance was lower in

15

1985, and then --

16

QUESTION:

But jurisdiction does not remain

17

until the results of segregation are gone.

18

until all practicable remedies to accomplish that have

19

been gone, and that, it seems to me, you have not

20

addressed.
MR. BENDER:

21

It remains

Well, one way you could show that,

22

for example, is after the remedies were started you would

23

look at test scores, or other indicia like attendance

24

rates, for the next 2 years, and see what happened to

25

them.

indication that you had done as much as was practicable to

do.

5

again I think would show that you had done as much as was

practicable to do, because these remedies were the

7

remedies which were the state-of-the-art educational

8

remedies at the time.

I think that would be a very powerful

You might find that they never went up at all, which

But you might find that they have been going up

10

every year, and that that progress continues, and if you

11

found that, and in addition found that the level of

12

progress was below the level in Philadelphia, or San

13

Francisco, or New York, that would be powerful evidence

14
»

that the remedies should not be stopped, because the
effects of the segregation were still there.

16
17

QUESTION:

Don't you think the amount of money

spent is one element of practicability?

18

MR. BENDER:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BENDER:

Absolutely.
At $1.3 billion here already.
A lot of that was spent on capital

21

improvements which are not repetitive expenses, but I

22

agree with you completely that the level of expenditure

23

necessary is relevant.

QUESTION:

And what about the length of time

MR. BENDER:

QUESTION:

4

Also relevant.
-- when it's managed by a Federal

district judge?
MR. BENDER:

5

All of those things are relevant,

6

but those things are exactly what the district court

7

should be asked to consider, and those are the issues on

8

which the State has the burden of proof in showing that it

9

has done whatever it is practicable to do.

What are the

10

additional costs of continuing these remedies for a couple

11

of years?
QUESTION:

12

Well, don't you think those things

13

were before the district court, the amount of money that

14

had been spent and the length of time?

15

that wasn't presented, or argued, or - -

16

MR. BENDER:

No.

Are you suggesting

The amount of money that had

17

been spent up until then was before the district court,

18

but I don't think that the State presented to the district

19

court any of the evidence I'm talking about, or how these

20

remedies worked.
In fact, the State has said here today that

21
22

that's a totally irrelevant question.

maintained that position below, then it did not make that

24

showing.

MR. BENDER:

2

QUESTION:

That's where the thing starts.
You say it must present this evidence

3

in order to resist an order requiring it to increase

4

teacher salaries?

5

That's exactly where we are.

MR. BENDER:

We - - the Government has not taken

6

a position on the teacher salary issue, which does not

7

have national importance.

8

only district in which that issue has arisen.

As far as we know this is the

9

But to the extent that teacher salaries are

10

relevant, and I think to some extent they are, to the

11

quality of the education program, and to the extent that

12

it's necessary to keep teacher salaries at a certain

13

minimum level to ensure that you're getting decent

14

teachers into the system, yes, the State would have to

15

show that if you lowered the teacher salaries, if you

16

withdrew the support for teacher salaries, then you

17

wouldn't go back to the educational deficiencies that you

18

had before.

19

QUESTION:

But on the salary issue it seemed

20

like it was just a very convenient way for the school

21

district and the labor union to get what they wanted

22

without going through collective bargaining, and there are

23

some very unattractive features --

here, and the State is just left holding the bag because

2

the school district and the labor union make a deal with

3

the court that the court's going to set the salaries.

4

MR. BENDER:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. BENDER:

But I think, Justice -It can't be relevant.
-- O'Connor, it's very important

7

for this Court to make clear that you have to follow an

8

orderly procedure in withdrawing from those remedies, that

9

you don't do that by making factual assertions in an

10

appellate court or in the Supreme Court that you -- you

11

don't do that by making assertions that you don't back up

12

with proof.

13

The way to do that is to go to the district

14

court and say, look, we don't think that we should have to

15

be having all-day kindergartens any more, because the

16

students coming into the school now have not been harmed

17

by the prior segregation.
