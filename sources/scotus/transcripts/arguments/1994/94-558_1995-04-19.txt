ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. IEYOUB

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE APPELLANTS

10

GENERAL IEYOUB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This is the Louisiana congressional

12

reapportionment case, the first such case to reach this

13

Court on the merits after Shaw v. Reno.

14

The district court held that Louisiana's Fourth

15

Congressional District violated the Equal Protection

16

Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

17

also held that all race - conscious redistricting, while not

18

always unconstitutional, is always subject to strict

19

scrutiny.

20

The district court

Louisiana's population is over 30 percent black.

21

Since the end of Reconstruction until the 1980's blacks

22

have never comprised a majority in any of Louisiana's

23

congressional districts.

24

by Federal court order, that Louisiana drew its first

25

majority minority district, and not until 1990 did

It wasn't until 1983, compelled

'

In this century, no black has been elected to

either State-wide office, or to Congress, or the State

legislature, except from majority-minority districts, and

I hardly need to remind this Court - -

QUESTION:

about, what is a majority minority district?

8

GENERAL IEYOUB:

Your Honor, I think a majority

minority district is a district that will give minorities

10

a fair opportunity to elect representatives of their

11

choice.

12

^

What do you mean, General Ieyoub,

QUESTION:

Well then, it's almost self-defining,

13

isn't it?

14

except from a district which will give minorities a chance

15

to elect a minority, is there any independent definition

16

of a majority minority district?

17

I mean, if you say nobody has been elected

GENERAL IEYOUB:

Your Honor, I do not know of

18

any independent definition.

19

contains a majority minority population.

20

Louisiana's Fourth Congressional District has a 55 percent

21

majority minority population.

22

QUESTION:

It's simply that the district

Well, so that perhaps is the

23

definition, that the district has a majority of a minority

24

population.

GENERAL IEYOUB:

Yes, Your Honor.

a history of past discriminatory practices.

Yes, Your Honor.

By intentionally drawing the

districts according to race, and having people run on the

19

basis of race, presumably, in these racial districts, you

Your Honor, there was evidence

QUESTION:

That's a new one to me.

QUESTION:

I didn't know that we had a case that

struck down political gerrymandering on the basis of

protecting incumbents.

GENERAL IEYOUB:

That is my mistake, Your Honor.

I don't believe that the Court has ever struck down a

To some extent, Your Honor, but

not so dramatically that one could say it was a dramatic

dramatically from past historical configurations.

QUESTION:

This we submit,

In

General, may I go sort of behind your

10

present argument to what I understand your brief to say

11

and raise a question about that?

12

As I understand it, the point of what you're

13

arguing now is that because this district is not bizarre,

14

since it -- on historical grounds there's nothing that

15

unusual about it, there shouldn't be any strict scrutiny

16

applied at all, because you say Shaw and Reno requires

17

bizarreness as sort of the threshold showing in order to

18

require a strict scrutiny analysis, is that your argument?

19

GENERAL IEYOUB:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I have been assuming, and you correct

21

me if I'm wrong, that just as you would try to define

22

bizarre by what is traditional, that you would probably

23

argue, and I guess I have assumed, that what is

24

sufficiently compact for the Gingles test probably has the

25

same sort of historical criterion.

If it's compact to the

degree it historically has been, that's compact enough.

2

GENERAL IEYOUB:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Here's the problem I have with the

4

argument.

5

we apply strict scrutiny, then once we find that a

6

district is bizarre enough to be subject to the scrutiny,

7

it's necessarily going to flunk the Gingles test, so that

8

it could never, in effect, be justified as necessary or

9

reasonably necessary to avoid a section 2 violation.

10

If that is going to be the condition upon which

Conversely, if it doesn't flunk the Gingles

11

test, if it's not bizarre, then if we adopt your position

12

or adopt the bizarreness position, we would never, at

13

least, be scrutinizing it for any other purpose.

14

would, for example, never get to the point of scrutinizing

15

it for packing.

16

We

How do we get out of that bind, that if we

17

scrutinize it at all it's necessarily going to flunk.

18

we don't scrutinize it, we never would look to other

19

violations such as a packing violation?

20

GENERAL IEYOUB:

If

Your Honor, I think that

21

initially one can look at the particular configuration of

22

the district and make a determination, at least looking at

23

it, whether or not the configuration is bizarre.

ultimately classify it as bizarre or not is going to

GENERAL DAYS:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- Justice O'Connor was trying to get

at.

Supposing that the shape itself does not prove to be

9

really "bizarre" but a finding of fact is made that the

10

predominant purpose of the legislature was to construct a

11

majority minority district.

12

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, under those circumstances I

13

think the case would move into strict scrutiny and the

14

State would have to show a compelling interest for doing

15

what it was doing.

16

QUESTION:

So bizarreness by -- is not an

17

essential ingredient of a claim.

18

GENERAL DAYS:

I think it is, because prior to

19

Shaw v. Reno, and as I indicated I don't think Shaw v.

20

Reno changed the law, it was not possible to set out an

21

equal protection claim unless one could show that there

22

was some injury.

v. Reno that it changed that law.

That is, intent to discriminate and a

a district with the predominant purpose of composing it on

the basis of one race, or substantially one race.
GENERAL DAYS:

4

With respect, Justice Kennedy, I

5

don't think that's what Shaw v. Reno says.

6

the district is drawn in a way that can be reasonably

7

understood as being solely for the purpose of separating

the races.

the State is responsible for justifying that under strict

scrutiny.

QUESTION:

In your view, why should that be a

constitutional violation under Shaw?
GENERAL DAYS:

Because this Court did not change

the prior law, and what the prior law said, what this

Court recognized, was that race is something that is

10

always a part of the redistricting process.

15

that as one threshold indicator of the prohibited intent.

16

GENERAL DAYS:

All you're imposing is a visual

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think

17

what this Court recognized in Shaw v. Reno and other

18

cases, as I was about to describe, was that race is a

19

consideration along with other criteria in the

20

redistricting process, so if what you're saying, Justice

21

Kennedy, is that whenever a State uses race as one of the

22

considerations in the redistricting process, it's

23

automatically moved over into strict scrutiny.

24

consequences are as follows.

25

Then the

recognized the interest of Creoles, decided that Creoles

2

had a different language, had a different religious view,

3

had different political views and different economic

4

concerns, that would not trigger any constitutional

5

review.

6

But if the State looked at a group of blacks and

7

decided that those blacks had commonalities of interest

8

that coincided with race but did not turn solely on race

9

and tried to recognize those communities of interest, the

10

reading that's being suggested would automatically shift

11

that determination by the State into strict scrutiny, and

12

it is our position that for this Court to suggest that

13

every time a State or a locality or a municipality goes

14

through a redistricting process and uses race as one of

15

the considerations that it moves into strict scrutiny has

16

several problems.

17

QUESTION:

General, I don't think the question

18

has been whether they use it at all.

19

question has been whether that has been the predominant

20

consideration.

21

GENERAL DAYS:

I thought the

I understand that, Justice -- you

22

know, whether that's the basis on which the district was

drawn, and I thought that that had been conceded here,

24

that these are not hypothetical questions you're getting.

General for the State acknowledges that that's how the

2

district was drawn, with the precise purpose of getting a

3

majority minority district.

4

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, but Justice Scalia, we can

5

talk about whether the State satisfied strict scrutiny,

6

but the point I think that is very important to make in

7

terms of the process is,

8

shifting burdens,

9

regular traditional district with no deviations

it's not merely a matter of

it is that even with a completely

10

whatsoever, the standard that the district court used,

11

namely, where race - conscious redistricting is involved it

12

is not necessarily unconstitutional but always subject to

13

strict scrutiny,

14

disruptive and incorrect way of looking at the districting

15

process.

16

is a very powerful and I think very

QUESTION:

Don't you think a distinction can be

made between situations where race is one of a lot of

factors that's considered in districting and situations in

which race is the determinative factor, where you set out

to create a majority minority district?

I think

1

the test that's being presented here would automatically

2

haul before the Court the legislative officers who were

3

involved in this process to probe their intent, to find

4

out what they were thinking, what all of them had in mind

5

when they passed the statute.

6

QUESTION:

But General Days, isn't it the case

7

here that it's conceded the endeavor was to create a

8

majority minority district, and I think you answered

9

Justice O'Connor's question by distinguishing Reno v. Shaw

10

from simply endeavoring to create a minority majority

11

district.

12

GENERAL DAYS:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

And you cited precedent.

I thought

14

you had in mind United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, and

15

wasn't the predominant purpose there to create a minority

16

majority district?

17

GENERAL DAYS:

Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, and

18

that's what I meant when I said that we did not understand

19

Shaw v. Reno to repudiate prior precedent, and in UJO,

20

five justices of this Court very clearly said --

21

QUESTION:

UJO was a badly splintered Court.

22

GENERAL DAYS:

It was badly splintered, but

recognition that in the limited circumstance where the

QUESTION:

In your view --

QUESTION:

As I understand it, what you're

8

saying is that, you're saying we should read what we - -

9

what the majority said in Shaw is a mechanism basically to

10

make the first cut so that every time there is not an

11

automatically litigable issue.

12

GENERAL DAYS:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.

My problem is, why isn't that also

14

going to function for reasons raised in my question as a

15

last cut?

16

In other words, if you flunk the bizarreness

17

test, you're necessarily going to flunk any attempt to get

18

a section 2 justification because it won't be compact with

19

Gingles.

20

based on historical comparison you don't look at anything

else, like packing?

Well, let me take the second part

of that.

That's

1

traditional lawsuit showing dilution, which was not a

2

right that was abrogated or altered in any way insofar as

3

we're concerned by Shaw v. Reno, so that claim would still

be available.

So Shaw and Reno basically is just

It's npt

8

GENERAL DAYS:

That's absolutely correct.

9

Now, on the question of whether a district is

of meeting strict scrutiny and showing a compelling

interest are narrow tailoring.

the claim that it was a strong basis in evidence for

QUESTION:

I think that if

Would there be an opportunity to

18

GENERAL DAYS:

I think there would be a

possibility of justifying it under the Fourteenth

there is obviously a connection between a bizarreness

2

finding and a section 2 defense, but not between

3

bizarreness and some of the other claims that are made.

4

QUESTION:

General Days, speaking of section 5,

5

in preclearing does the Department of Justice assume that

6

unless the legislature of the State creates a majority

7

minority district where it is possible to do it, that

8

otherwise there -- you would assume discrimination on the

9

part of the State?

10

GENERAL DAYS:

No, that's not the position.

11

It's a more totality of the circumstances analysis, and

12

it's not an automatic determination as to how that would

13

be resolved.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I guess we'll get into that

more in the next case, but let me ask you one other thing.

And they did not -- they lived in

I believe it was a contiguous

district, yes.

GENERAL DAYS:

1

Well, Justice O'Connor, as you

2

are aware, we did not raise the standing issue, but I

3

think that it is a problematic concern in this case.

4

Shaw v. Reno in fact entitled people because of certain

5

stigmatic harm or the possibility that they would not be

6

adequately represented to bring a Shaw v. Reno claim,

7

those who are either in the district or in adjoining

8

districts who might be affected by the district I think

9

probably have the type of standing that the Court had in

10

mind in Shaw v. Reno.
The problem is how far to take that, and whether

11
12

If

it can go to the extent of the entire State, anyone, any

3

place in the State can bring this type of lawsuit with

4

respect to one district.
QUESTION:

5

Well, if you're included in because

6

you're black, I presume you're excluded out because you're

white.

GENERAL DAYS:

QUESTION:

Yes.

Certainly a person who's contiguous

20

enough that he might have been included in but for the

fact that they wanted to exclude any more white votes, I

assume he'd have some complaint, but he might have to show

that, I guess.

MR. WARREN:

Well, it sure does.

the key to this District 4 is four metropolitan areas

which heretofore in Louisiana history had always been in

to creating this district was joining them together in one

district, combining them in one district.

21

The key

Now, when they were combined in one district, in

whether you make a distinction between race and other

suspect categories.

Americans, about Irish Americans?

a substantial purpose was to have a district where the

dominant national origin group would be Irish.

Would you make any different argument

Suppose the dominant or

becomes the touchstone, it's invalid.

We used the Kiryas

Joel case as an example of that and several justices on

4

this Court actually cited Shaw in connection with their

5

opinions in that case.

6

that case, the defining feature was the Hasidic sect, the

7

Satmar sect, and that, if it becomes the touchstone, is, I

8

think, the basis for invalidation.

The question is, and it was in

Race is different, and it's not

just race, it is suspect classifications.
QUESTION:

8

So normally race is different because

it's normally totally irrelevant to the decision.

see, in this case, apparently Louisiana made a decision

11

that it was not irrelevant, and therefore the normal

12

reason for strict scrutiny does not apply.

Well, race comes into play in lots

Here it's easy because the

district court held three separate hearings, it sorted

through all the facts, it heard all the evidence, it's

evident, self-evident, I think, to anyone who examines the

Gingles, when we're talking about difficult factual

Mr. Warren, when you speak about

difficult decisions, one of the many problems in this case

10

is when you deal with Shaw v. Reno, when you've got one

11

criterion, bizarreness, and that's not hard to apply, but

12

to determine predominant, substantial, and it can spread

13

to other groups, national origin groups that have been

14

classified as suspect, it seems you're getting -- you're

15

opening the door to the kinds of challenges that the

16

Federal courts were into of necessity in the school

17

segregation cases and to a limited extent in the

18

redistricting cases.
