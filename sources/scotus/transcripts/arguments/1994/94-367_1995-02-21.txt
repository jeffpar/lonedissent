ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. SPELLMIRE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SPELLMIRE:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it

please the Court:
The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act should

11
12

not be read to regulate the conduct of lawyers engaged in

13

the prosecution of litigation even if that litigation is

14

against the consumer for the collection of a debt, and as

15

those terms are defined in the act.

16

The act, when read as a whole, demonstrates that

17

it was not intended to regulate the behavior or conduct of

18

attorneys when they are performing acts which are uniquely

19

capable of performance by attorneys by reason of their

20

licensure.

21

The act is ambiguous, and a -- by its definition

22

of debt collector, and a literal application of the

23

language of that statute, that act, would result in absurd

24

outcomes, when reviewed with other statutes.

25

The congressional intent clearly establishes

1

that Congress never intended the act to reach the conduct

2

of lawyers performing the function of lawyers.

3
4

QUESTION:

exception that used to be in there for lawyers, didn't it?

5
6

Well, Congress certainly did drop the

MR. SPELLMIRE:

Yes, it did, Your Honor.

It did

drop that exception.

7

QUESTION:

And that certainly points in the

8

direction of at least opening the question as to whether

9

the definition of debt collector extends to lawyers who

10

regularly collect or attempt to collect debts owed to

11

another.

12

13
14
15
16

MR. SPELLMIRE:

I think there is no question,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And the language literally can cover

that kind of an attorney.
MR. SPELLMIRE:

Your Honor, I do -- the

17

petitioner does not agree that the language, when read in

18

light of the entire statute, could be interpreted as the

19

Court has suggested its interpretation.

20

When Congress removed the exception --

21

QUESTION:

On looking at the definition of debt

22

collector, and if you look at that in light of Congress'

23

repeal of any exception for lawyers, it does seem to me

24

that a lawyer could be a debt collector.

25

Now, it may raise other practical problems, but

1

if you look at that definition, it would appear possible

2

that a lawyer could be a debt collector.

3

MR. SPELLMIRE:

Your Honor, the definition,

4

taken in the context of the statute, is ambiguous.

5

There's no question that an attorney can perform the

6

activities of a debt collector, and when performing the

7

activities of a debt collector would be governed by this

8

act.

9

I think the phrase "debt collector" is clearly

10

understandable when it is focused to collection agencies

11

who through the mails or through the use of phone contact

12

bring personal pressure and contact to bear upon an

13

individual to pay a debt.

14

A lawyer, on the other hand, engaged in

15

litigation, applies to a court, and asks a court to find a

16

debt to be due, and asks a court to order the payment of

17

that debt.

18

There is a difference between the two, and when

19

read in the context of this statute, the definition of

20

"debt collector" unless -- unless there is some

21

explanation of what it means to collect a debt, remains

22

ambiguous.

23

Since it is ambiguous -QUESTION:

Isn't the ambiguity, though, answered

24

by the terms that were repealed, because prior to the

25

amendment the statute didn't merely have a general

1

exception for lawyers, the exception read, any attorney at

2

law collecting a debt as an attorney on behalf of.
That seems to refer to the peculiar functions

3
4

that lawyers perform, and it would seem that the exception

5

that used to be there is, in its terms, remarkably close,

6

if not identical, to the exception that you want us to

7

find as a way to resolve the ambiguity, and yet that was

8

repealed.

9

referred to lawyers acting as attorneys, cut against you

10

and resolve the very ambiguity that you raise?
MR. SPELLMIRE:

11
12

13

And doesn't the repeal of that language, which

No, it does not.

Let me

explain.
When Congress initially enacted this

14

legislation, it did have the exception, and lawyers,

15

attorneys, in all of their functions when representing a

16

client, were exempted from its coverage.

17

Following that enactment, lawyers then entered

18

into the debt collection business in competition with lay

19

debt collectors.

20

QUESTION:

Well, that is to say they took on a

21

lot of clients who had debts, and they specialized in debt

22

collection.

23

MR. SPELLMIRE:

24

QUESTION:

25

They performed --

They were still representing clients,

weren't they?

3
4

They were -- yes, they were

So they were doing just what the

exception says would not bring them subject to the act.
MR. SPELLMIRE:

5

They were representing clients,

6

but in order to understand the meaning of the term "debt

7

collector" within that statute, given its ambiguity, one

8

has to examine the purposes for which the exceptions were

9

removed, and the purpose and the congressional intention

10

in removing the statute was to subject attorneys, when

11

they engaged in the same activities as lay debt

12

collectors, to the same rules.

13

QUESTION:

Well, if that were the case, I don't

14

know why it was necessary, because the exception read,

15

attorney collecting a debt as an attorney."

16

say, I suppose, exercising those peculiar functions and

17

powers that lawyers, as attorneys, may exercise, and if

18

Congress meant nothing more than you say it meant, then it

19

would seem to me that the attorneys, to the extent that

20

they were doing something which was not peculiar to their

21

profession, would have been covered by the statute anyway,

22

so it wouldn't have been necessary to repeal the

23

exception.

QUESTION:

1

Well, how about -- and I don't want

2

to cut you off from getting into that, but how about a --

3

just a comment on the text of the exception itself.

4

exception was limited to the exercise of functions as an

5

attorney, i.e., functions which any debt collector in

6

general would not have been able to exercise.

7

MR. SPELLMIRE:

At the time the exception was

8

enacted with the original enactment of the act,

9

attorneys -QUESTION:

Okay, but isn't that what the text

says?

12

MR. SPELLMIRE:

That is what the text says.

13

QUESTION:

Okay.

14

QUESTION:

Well, does that have to mean only

Okay.

15

those functions that only an attorney can perform?

16

you not be hired as an attorney for purposes of collecting

17

the debt, and part of what you could do as an attorney is

18

to call up the person that owes the debt and say,

19

my client money.

Can

"You owe

I'm the client's attorney."

20

MR. SPELLMIRE:

21

QUESTION:

You --

When are you going to pay the debt?

22

Would that person be acting as an attorney, if he was

23

hired as an attorney?

24

MR. SPELLMIRE:

25

QUESTION:

No.

I'm trying to help you here.

QUESTION:

I would think he would be, and I

4

would think that that's

does not necessarily mean doing only those things that

6

lawyers can do.

7

it in the capacity of having been hired as an attorney.

9

It could mean doing anything, but doing

QUESTION:

8

-- you know, that as an attorney

And isn't that what Congress

responded to when it cut out the attorney exemption,

10

attorneys calling up people in the middle of the night

11

doing all the things that bad old debt collectors did?
MR. SPELLMIRE:

12

That was the purpose, was to

13

include attorneys when they were acting as a debt

14

collector, when they were engaging in the kinds of

15

activities that were forbidden by the act --

16

QUESTION:

You don't want to say when they were

17

acting as a debt collector.

18

attorneys, they were doing the things that debt collectors

19

do.
MR. SPELLMIRE:

20
21
22

You want to say, when, as

I will accept the Court's

statement.
QUESTION:

But if you say that, you've got to

23

explain why the text read the way it did, and I haven't

24

heard that explanation yet.

MR. SPELLMIRE:

The text read the way it did

1

when it was originally enacted because at that time

2

attorneys had not invaded the debt collection business as

3

they did in the years intervening.

4

QUESTION:

That explains why they later perhaps

5

wanted to broaden the coverage of the act, but it doesn't

6

explain why they seemed, in the exception, to want to

7

limit the exception by that phrase, which I assume has

8

some meaning,

9

limitation in there, if you're going to accept Justice

10
11

"as an attorney."

Why did they put that

Scalia's argument?
MR. SPELLMIRE:

Your Honor, at the time of the

12

original enactment, inasmuch as Congress was exempting

13

attorneys, Congress was not concerned with the types of

14

activities attorneys were engaged in at that time.

15

became -- it was later that they became concerned with the

16

types of activities that attorneys were engaged in, that

17

is, attorneys performing debt collecting activities.

18

QUESTION:

I assume they put that language in,

19

or I assume you think they put that language in, to

20

exclude the situation where a fellow who has a law degree

21

is employed by a collection agency.

anyone as an attorney.

23

He is not hired by

He happens to have a law degree.

If you exclude all attorneys from coverage of

debt collection agencies would be staffed entirely by

people with law degrees, who would not be acting as

QUESTION:

3

Yes, but the original exemption was

the blanket exemption for attorneys.

It was only when

Right, for a client.

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

8

QUESTION:

Yes --

9

QUESTION:

Well, that --

10

QUESTION:

-- and just an attorney-employee of a

11

debt collection agency would not have been exempt under

12

the original act.

13

MR. SPELLMIRE:

14

QUESTION:

Not by reason of its language.

And you want in -- if I understand

15

it, your exception is an exception for lawyers who are

16

acting in the exercise of their peculiar functions as

17

attorneys, as distinct from the functions that any debt

18

collector could perform.

19

MR. SPELLMIRE:

That is correct.

An attorney

20

should not be regulated by this act when performing the

21

functions peculiar to the --

1

be implemented by reason of the ambiguity contained in

2

this statute, and it is clear that Congress did not intend

3

to interfere with or regulate the practice of law by

4

lawyers in their capacity as lawyers in this country.

5

What they did intend to do was, to the extent

6

attorneys engaged in activities similar to those forbidden

7

by this act, that they should be regulated by the act.

8

9
10

QUESTION:

If I understand it, there are three

situations:
1.

People who have law degrees are not even

11

hired as attorneys.

12

They are attorneys, but they're hired as debt collectors,

13

work for a debt collection agency.

14

client relationship, whatever.

15

They just happen to have law degrees.

There's no attorney-

Situation 2, there is an attorney-client

16

relationship, and the lawyer is doing the things that debt

17

collectors do, not things that only lawyers can do.

18

And situation 3, there is an attorney-client

19

relationship, and the lawyer is doing things which only

20

lawyers can do.

All right?

21

And as I understand your position, the original

22

statute, which was repealed, covered situation 1, and the

23

current statute, after the repealer, covers situation 2

24

but does not cover situation 3.

Did I go too fast?
No, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

Is that what you're saying?

6

MR. SPELLMIRE:

The statute as originally

7

enacted would have exempted situations 2 and 3.

8

it is our position that in repealing the exemption,

9

Congress meant to include example 2 but did not mean to

10
11

We are --

include example 3.
QUESTION:

Well, would you explain example 2,

12

maybe, because I thought in example 2 there was a lawyer-

13

client relationship, and yet the lawyer was not acting in

14

any function, or performing any function peculiar to

15

lawyers, so the relationship seems to be an empty one,

16

because he's doing the same things, and only those things,

17

that he was doing under example 1, isn't that correct?

18

And if that is correct, then what we're left

19

with is the preservation of a lawyer exception, i.e.,

20

example 3, which seems to be the same exception that was

21

in the old exception that was repealed.

22

MR. SPELLMIRE:

No.

When the act -- when the

23

exemption was repealed, it is true that example number 2

24

then fell within the act.

QUESTION:

1

How about just writing a letter,

2

which many perfectly legitimate collection lawyers do?

3

Before you file a lawsuit, maybe we can get this by

4

letter.

5

Is that covered in so-called 2?
MR. SPELLMIRE:

Since that letter could be

6

written by a person who does not possess a law license,

7

that could be covered, and that lawyer, in that act, would

8

fall within the purview of the Fair Debt Collection

9

Practices Act, according to our interpretation of that

10

act.
QUESTION:

11

So it's only when you file a lawsuit,

12

under your view, on behalf of a client, that a lawyer is

MR. SPELLMIRE:

The reason is that in

QUESTION:

Well, section 1692c (b) allows

QUESTION:

All right.

Maybe that's not right as

applied to a lawyer.

11

MR. SPELLMIRE:

12

QUESTION:

That might be.

What it says is, a debt collector may

13

not be held liable if the violation was not intentional,

14

and resulted from a bona fide error, so if in fact the

15

client comes and says, A, B, and C is true, the lawyer

16

thinks that's probably right, puts him on the stand, the

17

jury disbelieves him, the lawyer would not be liable, as

18

long as the lawyer was in good faith.

19

mean, doesn't that solve most of the problem?

20
21

MR. SPELLMIRE:

25

As good faith has been

described, that would solve that problem.

22

23

Is that right?

QUESTION:

Then what other problems are in the

chamber?
MR. SPELLMIRE:

debtor can express the desire to no longer be contacted,

and that can bring about a cessation of any contacts with

2

that debt collector by anybody -- excuse me, debtor by

3

anybody.
QUESTION:

4

But it says you can communicate to --

where the creditor intends to invoke a specified remedy.

Might that not imply that the lawyer can then go ahead and

invoke the specified remedy?

MR. SPELLMIRE:

The verification and disclosure

provisions would be applicable to pleadings, to

complaints, and to virtually all documents that

17

constituted communications that would be sent.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SPELLMIRE:

And what harm does that cause?
Your Honor, may I return to your

20

prior question for a second?

While the answer that I gave

21

to that question was accurate, in the context, however,

22

of, for example, a deposition, should the debtor take the

23

position that the debt is disputed, that would have to

terminate all activities at that time with respect to that

deposition.

This would allow for the very serious

disruption, if it were utilized, of this act to frustrate

the normal rules of procedure.

4

QUESTION:

Well, but there's an exception with

5

the express permission of a court of competent

jurisdiction.

7

MR. SPELLMIRE:

That would still require, Your

8

Honor, an attorney to apply to a court if it occurred at a

9

deposition.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

For a deposition order, yes.

I mean,

that's not unusual, either.
MR. SPELLMIRE:

It is very unusual, Your Honor,

13

in the normal litigation context, for a deponent party to

14

determine that that party no longer wishes to be

15

communicated with.

16

QUESTION:

Don't you think an ordinary notice of

17

deposition, pursuant to the rules, would imply the

18

permission of the court?

19

MR. SPELLMIRE:

I'm not sure that that would

20

imply, necessarily, the permission of the court, because

21

very often, such notices may be sent unilaterally.

22

QUESTION:

I realize you don't need a court

approval to notice someone's deposition, but the rules

provide for the notice, and it seems to me one could argue

Mr. Spellmire, what do we make of the

they didn't say, it doesn't apply to other things

connected with litigation.

18

MR. SPELLMIRE:

interpretation of that particular exception indicates the

intention of Congress that the act not apply to matters

21

for anything else?

3

MR. SPELLMIRE:

Pursuant to their intention, and

their congressional purpose in this law, they didn't need

any further exemption, because attorneys from their view,

6

Congress' view, were not within the ambit of this act when

they were engaged in litigation and -- engaged in

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. EDELMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

The issue before the Court is whether otherwise

10

illegal conduct by one who regularly collects consumer

11

debts is outside the scope of the Fair Debt Collection

12

Practices Act because that person is acting as a lawyer.

13

The statute was originally passed in 1977.

At

14

that time, in a number of States, including such large

15

States as California, a collection agency, a lay

16

collection agency, could take an assignment of a debt and

attorney, to enforce it.

There is in addition an exemption in 1692a(6)(D)

3

for attempting to serve legal process on any other person

4

in connection with the judicial enforcement of any debt.

5

The phrase "judicial enforcement of any debt" would have

6

no meaning unless it were within the basic scope of debt

Going back to the 1986 repeal of the attorney-

history that its intent was to place attorneys and lay

Congress responded to this concern by totally

deleting the attorney exemption and refusing to enact

statutes which were proposed by the Commercial Law League

there would remain an attorney exemption.

18

As a result, we have a statute which once

contained an express exclusion for the matter at issue

where Congress declined to enact precisely that position

which said, we're not going to enforce the act against

2

attorneys engaged in litigation.
The FTC -- not even the Commission itself has

3

rule-making authority under the Fair Debt Collection

5

Practices Act.

6

very broad rule-making authority given to the enforcing

7

agencies under the other eight or nine titles of the

Consumer Credit Protection Act, but in this one case, the

9

enforcing authority is completely denied any rule-making

10

It's a fairly unique situation.

There's

authority whatever.
And notwithstanding this, we have a commentary

11

12

which is read by petitioners to say -- to create an

13

exemption.

There is no authority to create such an

14

exemption.

An administrative agency, much less its staff,

15

cannot create statutory exemptions without some basis in

16

the congressional enactment that purports to authorize it.

17

The staff commentary, incidentally, does not

18

actually support petitioner's position in this case,

19

insofar as it applies to the letter.

20

if an attorney does not engage regularly in consumer debt

21

collection activity, he's not subject to the act insofar

22

as litigation conduct is concerned, but it is now conceded

23

by petitioners that they do engage regularly in consumer

24

debt collection activity, such as sending consumers

25

dunning letters.

1

So basically, we have a statute which I think is

2

plain on its face, when you consider the sequence of basic

3

definition of debt collection, which even in Black's Law

4

Dictionary covers suing someone for a debt, the original

5

attorney exemption, and the removal of that attorney

6

exemption while all along litigation conduct by collection

7

agencies is regulated, and intentionally regulated, by the

8

statute.

9

If you look at the legislative history,

you

10

find, again, an intent on the part of Congress to subject

11

lawyers to regulation that did not heretofore exist.

12

QUESTION:

What is your answer specifically to

13

the argument that this will chill full adversarial zeal,

14

the best representation of the client, because the

15

attorney will be intimidated by the prospect of liability,

16

so will hold back arguments that might be tenable, but

17

that ultimately fail?

18

MR. EDELMAN:

Your Honor, insofar as the issue

19

before the Court is concerned, namely, adding charges to

20

debts which are not expressly authorized, Congress

21

intentionally, and with application to both lawyers and

22

other debt collectors, imposed a strict standard.

23

consumer cannot be subjected to any charge that someone

24

might be able to dream up a nonfrivolous argument in

25

support of.

Congress was careful about this, because it

realized that the vast majority of collection lawsuits go

argue against the lawyer, and accordingly, it made the

5

standard one of whether the debt is expressly authorized,

or whether the charge is expressly authorized by the

instrument creating the debt, or permitted by law.
It's not an unfair standard, because first, if

8

9

There is no one there to

no one is going to argue against the imposition of the

10

charge, it shouldn't be routinely imposed where it will

11

greatly -- as in this case, greatly increase the amount of

the debt, and the consumer is not represented and says

nothing.

In addition, normally, most collection lawyers

are enforcing printed form contracts.

It's very easy for

So Congress did tighten the standard, and it

20

would not be appropriate for an attorney to argue that a

21

consumer is liable for insurance or some other charge that

22

a nonfrivolous argument could be made with respect to, but

23

which is not expressly authorized in the instrument

24

creating the debt.

25

That problem, or that restraint, has nothing to

1

do with the attorney's status as attorney.

The collection

2

agency can't demand such a charge before the matter is in

3

litigation, or during litigation, and the same restraint

4

is imposed upon the attorney.
So the answer to Your Honor's inquiry, Your

5
6

Honor, is that the act imposes certain restrictions, it

7

imposes them equally upon lawyers and nonlawyers who are

8

collecting consumer debts, and in the 17 years that the

9

act has been applied to collection agencies, these

10

restrictions have not been found to impose an undue burden

11

upon the collection of debts for consumers or the

12

extension of consumer credit.

13

Congress had a -- was faced with a problem in

14

balancing the interests of collection agencies and then

15

collection lawyers on the one hand and the public on the

16

other, it drew that balance very carefully, and I think

17

the judgment of Congress as expressed in the act should be

respected.

That judgment does not permit of an attorney

20

What the petitioner's argument, I think, really

21

boils down to is an appeal to the reluctance of attorneys

22

to impose liability on other attorneys.

23

that position is that Congress did exactly that after an

24

8-year trial period of an exemption, and specific

25

provisions of the act address explicitly litigation
