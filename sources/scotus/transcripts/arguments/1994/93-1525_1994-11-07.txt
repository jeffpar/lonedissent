CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

5

Passenger Corporation.
Justice Breyer has asked me to announce that he

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14
15

MR. COLE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

16

This case asks whether Amtrak was subject to the

17

constraints of the First and Fifth Amendments when it

18

refused to display Michael Lebron's advertisement in

19

Pennsylvania Station, New York, because of its political

20

content.

21

If Amtrak is correct that it is a private actor,

22

then an entity wholly owned by the United States, managed

23

by the U.S.-appointed board, dependent on massive United

24

States subsidies for its very survival, would be

25

constitutionally free to engage in blatant viewpoint

discrimination.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Cole, we don't have before us, do

3

we, any question as to whether, if Amtrak is indeed a

4

Government entity as you contend, whether it would be

5

permissible for it to take the action that it did here?
MR. COLE:

6

That's -- that's correct, Your Honor.

7

The -- Amtrak's argument is that no matter what its speech

8

policies are, they are not subject to constitutional

9

review because they are not a State actor.
QUESTION:

10

And you say they are subject to

11

constitutional review, but the question of, if they're

12

subjected to that constitutional review, is it permissible

13

or not, is not before us.

14
15

MR. COLE:

That would be decided by the First

Circuit -- I mean, by the Second Circuit on remand.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Cole, in the proceedings in

17

courts below, it appeared to me that your client waived

18

any argument in the nature of a direct argument that

19

Amtrak is a Government agency, and instead proceeded on a

20

rather different theory.
MR. COLE:

21

Well, we didn't waive any claim, Your

22

Honor.

This Court held in Yee that one waives claims, not

23

arguments.

24

are that Mr. Lebron's First and Fifth Amendment rights

25

were violated because Amtrak is a Federal actor.

The claims that we have made from the outset

MR. COLE:

In the lower courts,

the Second

Circuit had held that Amtrak was not a governmental entity

for various purposes.

like certain laws like the APA, et cetera, the Federal

2

Tort Claims Act, would not apply.

3

However, we have always maintained that because

4

this entity is owned and controlled by the United States,

5

it must be subject to the constitutional constraints that

6

apply where the Government is responsible for a particular

action.

QUESTION:

Mr. Cole, I suppose in the abstract

we could approach the issue in either of two ways.
We could approach it by asking the question

11

whether, for purposes of controlling advertising policy,

12

Amtrak should be regarded as a Federal entity, a

13

characterization way of approaching the case, and the

14

other way would be to approach it on the assumption,

15

arguendo, that Amtrak is private, and yet ask the question

16

whether the control by the national Government through the

17

appointment process and so on is so great that the

18

relationship, the nexus, however you want to call it, is

19

established.

20

Would it make any difference, for the outcome of

21

this case, whether we went the characterization route of

22

analysis as distinct from the relationship to the

23

undoubted national Government kind of analysis?

24
25

MR. COLE:

No, as long --we believe that the

question under the State action analysis is, is the

challenged?

3

Amtrak, its ownership and control by the United States,

5

is responsible for this conduct, for the policy that we

have challenged here.

The question --

Mr. Cole, are you saying this is in

Our position, Your Honor, is that

QUESTION:

purposes?

How about for sovereign immunity

It would not be immune -MR. COLE:

For sovereign immunity purposes it's

18

not immune because Congress established -- gave it the

19

right to sue and be sued, and therefore it's not immune

20

under the sovereign immunity principles, and there are

21

various -- the question of whether an entity is an agency

Oh, no, you've said more than that.

You've said, for constitutional issues --

14

MR. COLE:

Right.

QUESTION:

-- Congress can't change it by just

MR. COLE:

2

Well, I think -- I think, two points

3

in response to that, Justice Scalia.

4

of whether Amtrak is constitutionally responsible for the

5

conduct challenged here cannot turn on whether Amtrak is

constitutionally composed.

constitutionally composed.

8

First, the question

We don't argue that it's not

QUESTION:

No, I --

MR. COLE:

Second of all, we do believe that it

10

is constitutionally composed because the directors of

11

Amtrak are appointed either by the President or by the

12

Secretary of Transportation and would be inferior officers

13

under the Appointments Clause.

QUESTION:

MR. COLE:

Inferior officers under the
Why are they inferior officers?
Well, the Congress has deemed that

they shall be appointed by the Secretary of

Transportation.

They --

QUESTION:

So whenever Congress makes that

20

appointment disposition the agency automatically becomes

21

an inferior agency, even if it isn't an inferior agency,

22

or the officers become inferior officers even if they

aren't?

Honor, is that whether Amtrak is constitutionally

responsible for its actions in this case does not turn on

whether its board is constitutionally composed.

3

QUESTION:

I didn't suggest that, but I'm just

4

exploring the consequences of your thesis that Amtrak is a

Government agency.

me, is that it is unconstitutionally composed, which may

7

have consequences elsewhere, though not with respect to

8

its First Amendment liability.

9

MR. COLE:

One of the consequences, it seems to

Well, we believe that if the Court

10

were to conclude that the officers were inferior officers,

11

it would be permissibly composed, because the executive

12

department, through the President or the Secretary of

13

Transportation, appointed --

QUESTION:

But you concede that the executive

does not control Amtrak.

Nobody but the directors really

MR. COLE:

Well, no --

18

QUESTION:

Except by a general law.

I mean,

19

Congress could pass a law, but they can control a lot of

20

things.

21

MR. COLE:

Well, no, in fact the United States

22

owns all of Amtrak's preferred shares and has 99 percent

23

of the votes, so the United States, as essentially the

24

sole shareholder of Amtrak, has the ultimate

responsibility for what Amtrak does.

I think, are appointed to 2-

QUESTION:

1

Well, Mr. Cole, may I interrupt you

2

here?

3

you have not proceeded on the basis of the

4

characterization theory, I thought the assumption of the

5

argument was that for the sake of argument, we will assume

6

that Amtrak is private, and the question is whether its

7

connection with the undoubted Government, i.e., the

8

President and the Secretary of Transportation and so on,

9

is such as to justify concluding that the action that it

10

I thought the assumption of the argument -- since

takes is ultimately State action.
And now you keep -- now in your argument you're

11
12

referring to Amtrak not as a private actor, but, in

13

effect, as a governmental actor, and if we make that

14

assumption, it's all over.

1

2

of the board, there's no private entity to which you can

3

point which is responsible for the actions alleged, and

4

the Congress has recognized this.

5

With respect to virtually every other

6

corporation, it has acknowledged that those corporations

7

which it owns in whole and whose boards it appoints are

8

wholly-owned Government corporations, are treated as

9

agencies, and would clearly be State actors.

10

Those entities which Congress supports which are

11

privately owned, privately run, like the Government -

12

sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Sallie Mae,

13

et cetera, those are treated as private entities and ought

14

to be treated as private entities, because they are

15

privately owned, they are privately run, the only

16

governmental involvement there is the Government has a

17

minority representation on the board, usually 3 of 15

18

members of the board.

But where an entity is owned and controlled by

3

As soon as 51 percent of the shares switch over

from the board drop down to a very small number, and

6

7

lodged in a private majority board, and it is no longer an

So Congress itself has recognized that the

very much like Amtrak, formed for the same purpose and

didn't think that that made the corporation part of the

May I ask, in making that

May I also ask, along with the Chief

be so, but our point is different.
Our point is, if you're going to read it that

2

3

generously, you're going to read it to include an argument

4

that was explicitly withdrawn from the case in the court

5

of appeals, but I'm prepared to address the question in

6

case the Court does entertain it.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Baine, it's easy to concede this

8

is not a Government agency for the Federal Tort Claims Act

9

purposes, it is not a Government agency for purposes of

10

APA purposes, but where is there a concession that this is

11

not a Government actor for purposes of constitutional

12

limitations?

13

MR. BAINE:

Well, I would simply direct the

14

Court's attention to the petitioner's brief in the

15

district court and the court of appeals, in which they

16

said they do not contend that Amtrak is a Government

17

entity, but, rather, a private entity so interrelated to

18

Federal entities that it's to be treated as a State actor

19

here.
Now, if the question is presented whether or not

20
21

this is a Federal agency or instrumentality for all

22

purposes, our answer to that question is no for three

23

reasons.

24
25

First, because Congress very unambiguously said
the entity they were creating was not to be considered

1

part of the Government.

2

Second, because this Court said in the pass

3

rider case, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe case, that

4

Amtrak is not a governmental entity, but rather a private

5

corporation.
And third, because there were valid and

6

7

legitimate reasons why Congress said that Amtrak should

8

not be a part of the Government and, indeed, today Amtrak

9

has important features that are not at al like a

10

Government agency, and that are very much like a business.

11

QUESTION:

Would you --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Baine --

13

QUESTION:

Would you agree with the

14

characterization I suggested before that this is a

15

centaur-like entity, that it is part private, part

16

Government?

17

MR. BAINE:

One could call it quasi-public in

18

the sense that that word is sometimes used to refer to

19

corporate entities.

20

There are aspects of Amtrak that one could say

21

are public in the sense the public rides the trains, and

22

it's certainly true that the Government regulates Amtrak

23

and has the other relationships that we've been talking

24

about.

25

But our position is that if you have an entity

1

that arguably has some features that may be governmental

2

and some that are private, the appropriate question is,

3

what about the action or the policy that we're talking

4

about here, is that influenced by the fact that the

5

Government's involved, and the answer to that is clearly

6

no.

The policy against political advertising --

7
8

QUESTION:

Mr. Baine, can I test your hypothesis

with a rather unlikely hypothetical question?

9

MR. BAINE:
QUESTION:

10

Certainly.
Assume that the board, viewing itself
I

11

as totally private, like -- it adopted a policy of

12

accepting advertisements only from Presbyterians and

13

Democrats, say, an extreme example, and would refuse all

14

other advertising.

18

not, if it's a totally private entity.

19

Congress disapproves of this policy,

Would that statute be constitutional?

MR. BAINE:

I think

We would begin the analysis with the

20

question whether or not Amtrak has any First Amendment

21

rights, and we would say that it does, and then we would

22

ask whether or not there was a compelling State interest

23

that justified the legislation that said Amtrak couldn't

24

discriminate in that sense.

In that case, it could come

But we would contend that Amtrak does have First

2

Amendment rights in the same way that its competitors

3

have.

4

QUESTION:

Well, if it has the same rights as

5

its competitor, private competitors have, it could engage

6

in a policy of selective advertising that could not be

7

overruled by statute.

8

9

MR. BAINE:

That may be, but it is a far-fetched

hypothetical, and in fact the policy in this case is that

10

Amtrak wanted very much to stay away from all matters of

11

controversy, to avoid any suggestion that they're favoring

12

one side or the other in political debate, and have no

13

political advertising whatsoever, and we think that's a

14

policy choice they ought to be able to make.

15

QUESTION:

Well, but that goes to the merits.

16

What Justice Stevens presents is the specter of a

17

corporation that is beyond Congress' control, a

18

corporation that on the one hand Congress funds,

19

subsidizes, and controls the appointment of 100 percent of

20

its directors, but on the other hand it cannot be

21

controlled by the Congress.

22

MR. BAINE:

That is very odd.

Well, under Rust v. Sullivan, I

23

think Congress would have the power to control the

24

expenditure of public funds, and if the concern here is

25

that Amtrak receives Government funds and might misuse

petitioner would be arguing that's exactly the way it

should come out.

12

I said before that - QUESTION:

Let's take a case without any

regulation.
Suppose Amtrak says, we don't want any

leafleting in Penn Station, and that's challenged as in

14

violation of the First Amendment, and this Court's

15

decision involving the Port Authority Terminal is cited by

16

the plaintiffs as precedent, could Amtrak have a policy

17

that says, no leafleting on these premises?

18

MR. BAINE:

Amtrak could have such a policy.

19

The important point to bear in mind, I think, is

20

that Amtrak is continuing in the same business of the

21

railroads that it succeeded, and it is important and it's

22

desirable, it seems to me, that Congress have the

23

flexibility to approach crises in the business world, to

24

essentially reorganize and restructure and industry, as it

did in this case, without necessarily saddling the

3

Amtrak's competitors in the airlines and the bus

4

companies are not required to observe all of the

requirements of the Constitution, and it is important that

MR. BAINE:

No, I don't think that's enough.

QUESTION:

So it's basically got to be day-to-

day management before the nexus is close enough?

be some evidence that the Government cared about Amtrak's

MR. BAINE:

Well, when the Court has faced the

question in the past that because of a relationship

19

the Government exercises any control, overt or covert,

20

over the particular decision that is at issue in the case,

21

and that surely did not happen here.

22

The petitioner is taking the position that, even

that we must assume that everything it does is

Are you willing to accept de facto

control as the criterion?

I mean, I can imagine a lot of entities,

including, for example, the Corporation for Public

Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts, many

11

private institutions that are so dependent upon Federal

subsidies, for example, that if it becomes pretty clear

that the Federal Government wants something to be done,

they will do it, lest they lose their subsidies.

which this is not a governmental action or policy at all.

The label that Congress placed on Amtrak was not

6

a mere label.

It has meaning, and it has consequences.

7

In fact, it's an instruction to Amtrak that it is not to

8

regard itself as part of the Government, and it's also an
instruction to the Government that it's not to think that

10

it can exercise control over Amtrak's affairs.

11

statement that Amtrak doesn't speak for the Government,

12

and the Government is not generally bound by what Amtrak

13

says.

14

It's a

At the very least, this statement by Congress

15

means that Amtrak and the Government are separate entities

16

and, as a general matter, the Government is not

17

responsible for what Amtrak does.

MR. BAINE:

In general, it doesn't, and I think

2

it does show that Congress was not simply acting blindly.

3

Congress recognized that there are some things about

4

Amtrak that suggest that it ought to ask whether or not

5

certain statutory policies apply, and in the case of FOIA,

6

it decided it would be a good idea if the public could

7

examine Amtrak's affairs and be able to learn about how to

8

conduct itself.

To recognize that in some respects

-- for purposes of the Freedom of

Information Act.

MR. BAINE:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.
And for purposes -- and also under

18

the Inspector Generals Act, do you know any private entity

19

that is'subject to that legislation?

20

MR. BAINE:

No, but in the Inspector General

21

Act, the Congress said, we're doing this, but we recognize

22

that Amtrak is not part of the Government.

23

What the statement by Congress that has been

24

accepted by this Court means is that as a general matter,

25

the Government is not responsible.

There may be some

1

instances where the Government is responsible for what

2

Amtrak does, but we would suggest that those instances are

3

instances in which the Government has, either by law, or

4

by regulation, or by exercise of coercion or influence,

5

had some impact on Amtrak's decision, and that is not the

6

case here.

7

This is a case of Government inaction.

Insofar

8

as this policy was concerned, the Government was

9

completely inactive and uninterested, and that is why the

10

argument, until the briefs in this Court, has been that

11

there's Government action under the theory of Burton,

12

which was a case in which, under very unusual

13

circumstances, this Court did hold that the Government's

14

inaction amounted to action.

15

Burton has never been applied beyond the limited

16

factual setting in which it occurred, and the last place

17

to apply it would be in a case involving the First

18

Amendment, where the constitutional command essentially is

19

to be inactive, and to leave the decisions regarding

20

speech to private entities.

21

The position that we think is supported by the

22

cases is that in a case like this, when there is evidence

23

that the Government has, in fact, influenced or affected

24

the decision that took place, it is fair to say that the

25

Government is responsible.

1

But when the Government has not had any

2

influence whatsoever over the particular action, in those

3

cases when Amtrak has made a decision for purely business

4

reasons, it ought to have the same freedom to act that its

5

competitors enjoy.

MR. COLE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

Going back to Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist's

13

question regarding the private initiation of this policy,

14

the case that is closest to this case is the Gerard

15

College case, in which a privately founded, privately

16

funded, privately funded institution was run by a board of

17

Government appointees, and this Court found that the

18

private founders' policy of limiting admission to white

19

males was State action because the board was responsible

20

for that policy.

21

the board was responsible.

22

The board didn't adopt that policy, but

The Pennsylvania supreme court found that the

23

board was not a governmental entity, because the city had

that compelling, and that, I think, underscores that the

2

case is not to be decided by label -QUESTION:

3

Perhaps you can remind me, were the

4

trustees of Gerard College ex officio members, or were

5

they simply private people that were appointed by the

city?

MR. COLE:

They were -- it was a -- they were

8

appointed by the Government.

They were not -- it was

9

only - - it was a board of trustees of the City of

10

Philadelphia, but the City of Philadelphia had said that

does not constitute a city entity.

not make it something other than what it actually is, an

purposes.

QUESTION:

There and here.

3

MR. COLE:

That's right, and we believe that,

ordinarily, where the Government appoints the board, it

ought to be treated as a State actor.
As this Court has held, all State action cases

6

7

depend on the facts and circumstances of the case, and

because of the statutory designation with respect to the

Corporation for Public Broadcasting, might be a different

question.

That's not a question posed here.
