ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. BABCOCK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BABCOCK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether Longshore Act

11
12

compensation for permanent partial disability stops when

13

economic harm caused by injury ends or whether the

14

benefits must continue in the absence of economic harm

15

until the worker's physical condition improves or fully

16

resolves.

17

It's an exercise in statutory construction.

18

the starting point must be the central and, we think,

19

undebatable fact that the statute contains no express

20

distinction between physical and other factors in

21

determining the conditions which may serve as grounds for

22

modification.

23

And

Any restrictions on modification -- this clear,

24

bright line that Respondent Rambo found -- finds

25

separating a worker's physical condition from all the

1

other factors and circumstances to collectively determine

2

the economic effects of injury -- has to be found outside

3

the statutory language itself.

4

We say that it cannot be found within the

5

structure of the Act, the meaning or the context within

6

which the meaning of the word must fit.

7

concept suited to a wage loss system.
This bright line, this sharp distinction, would

8

9

It's simply not a

provide benefits to those who have no economic loss, and

10

deny them to those to whom that disability -- that

11

economic loss -- was delayed.

12

When Congress has decided -- and they have

13

decided on several occasions -- to provide benefits in the

14

absence of economic loss, they've made that intention

15

quite clear.

16

at Sections 8(c)(1) through (20) of the Act -- it has been

17

there since its beginning in 1928 -- or as they did in

18

1984, they amended and tailored the definition of

19

disability to require focus on impairment in the case of

20

certain retiree cases involving occupational disease.

21

They've used a schedule, which now appears

And they did that because, in that instance, the

22

retirement was thought by the Benefits Review Board and

23

some courts to have foreclosed the prospect of economic

24

loss.

25

We see in the legislative history nothing that

demonstrates the presence of an intent to mark between

2

physical and economic factors.

3

the legislative -- in -- excuse me, in the decisions of

4

this Court no suggestion, particularly in Banks and

5

O'Keefe, that a distinction should occur.

6

QUESTION:

And we certainly see in

Now, the initial determination of

7

liability is made by considering things other than the

8

physical condition?

11

12

MR. BABCOCK:
QUESTION:

The --

The physical condition as well as the

effect on the -- the wage-earning ability?
MR. BABCOCK:

The original determination is made

13

in accordance with some instructions appearing at Section

14

8(h) of the Act, and includes, in addition to the physical

15

condition, virtually all that would affect either the

16

stability of the current employment or the prospects and

17

stability of future employment, both micro or personal

18

factors such as skills and capacities, and macro factors

19

such as the industry as a whole.

20

And in this situation, though, the source of

21

this perceived distinction, in our judgment, lies not in

22

the language, not in the structure, not in the history,

23

not in the decisions of this Court, but, instead, it lies

24

in what can be best called 62-year-old dicta, drawn from a

25

case in which the central question that we're now dealing

2

with was not even a factor.
That case, McCormick, a 1933 opinion out of the

3

9th Circuit -- we would reach the same conclusion in

4

McCormick regardless of whether we're following the

5

Fleetwood Rule, allowing consideration for modification

6

purposes of all factors, or following the more rigid rule

7

that the 9th Circuit adopted, simply because Fleetwood

8

lost his income because there was a depression.

9

-- and therefore he sought more compensation.

He didn't

10

Even under our rule, no more compensation would

11

be payable because the loss -- this additional loss -- is

12

unrelated to the injury itself.

13

QUESTION:

Fleetwood is the name of the person

14

involved in the McCormick case?

15

MR. BABCOCK:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

Fleetwood

16

is the name of the worker involved in the 4th Circuit case

17

as to which the 9th Circuit's opinion in this proceeding

18

stands in contrast.

19

in McCormick.

20

I've forgotten the name of the worker

Another case relied upon in Rambo and by

21

Petitioner at length is Pillsbury.

22

And in both cases is -- there has been repetition, we

23

think thoughtless repetition, of those cases and their

24

dicta throughout the years, and we don't think they have

25

gained any greater significance than they originally

Once again, dicta.

other cases.

QUESTION:

Do we -- do we adjust conditions for

4

inflation?

5

have changed, do you use the dollar amount he was earning

6

or -1- or -- to adjust that up or what?

7

I mean, when you figure out whether conditions

MR. BABCOCK:

The Benefits Review Board's rule

8

-- and it's been approved by, I think, all the circuits

9

that have looked at it, requires the parties who are

10

taking earnings at a date subsequent to the date of the

11

injury to prove, as a matter of fact, what those new jobs

12

or that new position would have paid at the time of

13

injury.

14

There's always an effort to bring it back to

15

erode the effects of inflation and make that not a

16

meaningful factor.

17

QUESTION:

And what if his condition gets worse?

18

If his physical condition gets worse, is there any remedy

19

for him?

20

MR. BABCOCK:

Well, it would depend on whether

21

one were working from the 9th Circuit or the 4th Circuit

22

position.

23

after he had been trained and gained the skills to be a

24

crane operator and was now making much higher earnings

25

than the typical longshoremen.

Settlement and the frequency of it -- 90 to 95

That's the best I can say.

7

I don't think it'll happen very often.

I know of no studies.

We lived with this rule

for 10 years, since Fleetwood, since the Benefits Review

Board has worked with it, and there certainly has been no

torrent of these cases.
QUESTION:

Of course, Fleetwood is a case where

the employer got the modification, wasn't it?

13

MR. BABCOCK:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

That's correct.

But are there similar cases where the

employee has gotten modification?
MR. BABCOCK:

In the amicus brief submitted by

17

Industrial Indemnity Insurance Company there was reference

18

to one case -- I believe it's name was Vasquez -- where an

19

employee had come in seeking modification as a result of a

20

loss of skills and a loss of employment and was awarded --

QUESTION:

Just -- just one case -- it would

22

seem to me that there is a lot -- there would be a lot of

possibilities for claims by employees that -- say the'job

you gave -- but why do you suppose there aren't more of

MR. BABCOCK:

2

Well,

I think first, in reality,

3

90 percent of these cases settle before the first hearing

occurs.

post-award, so that forecloses that basis for -- for

modification.

And then you have, following that, since '84 and

Are you saying that in your

experience there are say hundreds or thousands of cases in

10

which adjustments are requested because of economic

11

changes that the Board never sees?
MR. BABCOCK:

12

No, I'm saying -- excuse me -- I

13

see, one way or another, probably a third to half of the

14

longshore cases on the West Coast, both shipyards and

15

stevedoring trades.

1

there's just a -- just a -- a particularly good couple of

2

years for the industry, so that all the wages in the

3

industry are higher; is that one of those conditions?
MR. BABCOCK:

4

I think it will get you in the

5

door to a proceeding, seeking modification.

And if you

6

can persuade the administrative law judge that this blip,

7

this -- this hiccup in the economy, demonstrates a

8

permanent change in the worker's capacity to earn, one
which is likely to continue, as Section 8(h) required,

10

into the foreseeable future, then you will see an increase

11

in the average weekly -- in the wage-earning capacity.

12

MR. BABCOCK:

13

that would have happened anyway.

14

or no injury, he -- he should get the benefit of that

15

blip.

But that -- but that's an increase

He -- he would still have been in that industry.
MR. BABCOCK:

Well, that's right.

And -- and so

17

the response of any claimant in that situation is, even if

18

you've got this number -- he's going -- you know, that --

1

that it increased and it's permanent, he's going to turn

20

and say, I -- I would think, but this isn't in the

21

interest of justice -- which is your overall equitable

22

limitation on it and certainly one the Congress accepted

23

-- it isn't in the interest of justice to take away some

24

of my money because I would have been there anyway and I

25

would be successful.

MR. BABCOCK:

Oh, excuse me, the Board.

the Director, who we represent, has not taken a position

The only -- only ruling, though, it cited was a

MR. MINEAR:

Well, I think there were various

7

QUESTION:

When is the first clear indication of

8

what their -- their position was, it was not limited to

physical holding?

10

MR. MINEAR:

I think one clear holding would

11

have been in 1972, when the Assistant Secretary for Labor

12

indicated that if a worker failed -- indicated in

13

congressional oversight hearings -- that if a worker

failed to -- to accept rehabilitation opportunities, his

just to get it on the table -- it seems to me if the -- if

could have changed conditions both ways, and yet there

don't seem to be many.
MR. MINEAR:

Because there are a lot of reasons why you

necessarily so.

Well, I -- I don't think that's

And -- and there are several reasons for

10

that.

11

less back in the 1930's and the 1940's as compared to --

12

to today, when there are more opportunities for retraining

13

and rehabilitation.

14

First of all, the retraining opportunities were far

The common practice, as I understand it, during

15

the thirties and forties if an in -- if a worker was

16

injured was that he would be put in a light-duty program.

17

He'd receive compensation based on his decreased wages.

18

And his situation would not change very much.

that situation.
QUESTION:

2

So,

I mean,

there must be lots of

3

these people who have been able to improve their earning

4

capacity for reasons unrelated to their injury?
MR. MINEAR:

5

Well,

another difficulty is that in

6

fact,

7

the employer may not know what their current earnings.are.

8

Congress actually dealt with that issue in 1984 by

9

enacting 8(j)

in those cases where the people leave the industry,

of the Longshore Act, which allows an

10

employer to require a disabled employee to submit wage

11

statements so that the employer can keep track of what the

12

disabled worker's wages are.

13

The obvious reason for that was base -- was the

14

assumption that there would be a basis for modification of

15

awards based on the increased earnings.

16
17

QUESTION:

Yes, but the obvious one is

inflation?

MR. MINEAR:

1

MR. MINEAR:

To answer your question, the

2

Longshore Act does take into account inflation in Section

3

10, in the case of total disability, but not in the case

4

of permanent partial disability.

5

QUESTION:

So why weren't they all in and

6

saying, hey, first of all, inflation, and -- and second --

7

well, I mean inflation is the obvious one and I -- I'm

8

sure there -- there are a lot of others where -- where --

9

why wouldn't they just -- they get older -- that's the

10

other obvious one.

11

MR. MINEAR:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Well -And it is harder to find a job when

you're older.
MR. MINEAR:

Well, under our construction, those

15

types of considerations are not relevant changes in

16

conditions.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MINEAR:

Why not?

That's --

The reason why is because those

19

factors are considered in the initial benefits award.

20

determination is made in terms of what the person's future

21

wages might be.

22

Now, if there is a mistake --

1

that would arise under a mistake of fact rather than a

2

change in conditions, to the extent that that factor is

3

considered, in the initial benefits determination.

4

And as this Court indicated in O'Keefe, there's

5

no limitation to the types of facts that could be

considered in a particular case.

7

the same rule should apply to change in conditions.

QUESTION:

So we think that the --

Well, what about general -- a general

We go into a boom.

Someone who

was unemployable before now faces a -- a job market that

MR. MINEAR:

No, the Director generally doesn't.

And this is on the basis of McCormick and -- and Burley.

McCormick, you recall, was a case involving a -- the

17

at that point held -- the court of appeals -- held that

18

you do not take into account change -- economic changes of

that type in adjusting an award.

20

Burley was a case that involved an increase in

21

work available to a disabled worker during World War II,

22

because of the booming economy.

That is not a relevant condition.

there's a remarriage or a termination of benefits.

It clearly applies to the situation where

Yes, but that could be because it

covers mistakes as well as change in condition.

might explain why it applies to death benefits.

7

MR. MINEAR:

That

Oh, that's -- that's a separate

8

concern, again, whether or not there is State

9

compensation.

But under Section 909 or Section 9 of the

10

-- the Longshore Act, it's quite clear that there are

11

certain changes that can take place with regard to death

12

benefits, such as remarriage, such as the termination of a

13

minor child's dependency.

14

Section 22 serves the function of allowing

15

changes with regard to those changes as well.

16

no question that it has been applied for many years with

regard to those types of changes.

MR. PIERRY:

Interesting, Your Honor, on the

the issue of requiring the employee to file, at least

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. BABCOCK

14

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BABCOCK:

15

Well, first, we cannot see within

16

the Act or its structure -- structure justice when an

17

individual who no longer has an economic loss continuing

18

to receive benefits --

19

QUESTION:

Well, I'll presume that.

But isn't

20

it true that this whole statutory scheme is a replacement

21

of the tort liability scheme in which, if they'd been

22

injured, you got a recovery, and later on, when he

23

recovers completely, he still keeps whatever he got in the

24

tort case?

MR. BABCOCK:

No, I don't think that's a fair

I don't think you can characterize the bargain

employers and employees on both sides as simply a

replacement for a tort system.

QUESTION:

4

Because we're only talking about

nonscheduled awards, aren't we, in this case?

5

MR. BABCOCK:

6

QUESTION:

7

That's correct.

The scheduled awards go on whatever

happens?

8

MR. BABCOCK:

Well, I think -- in theory, you

9

would say that a scheduled award, because its focus is

10

solely for impairment of the worker -- 20 percent lost

11

function of an arm -- if somehow that improved and the

12

award had not been fully paid out by the time this all

13

occurred, that you would seek modification based on change

14

of physical condition.

QUESTION:

15

But in the non -- what I'm saying --

in the non -- in the scheduled award, it would have to be

17

a change of physical condition; you would agree with that?

MR. BABCOCK:

Yes, because that's the basis for

the award.
I think a couple of points about them and how

21

long and why there isn't an overburden -- and you can go

22

back to '81, and the -- and the 5th Circuit's opinion,

23

of the judges did and the 5th Circuit approved, in order

to avoid the running of what was seen as a sometimes harsh

statute of limitations.
And they provided this 1 percent award because

the economic effects might materialize later on.

So we

averages -- I just checked -- the number of cases -- new

7

cases -- filed under the Longshore Act dropped from 4,500

in 1984, when Fleetwood came out, to the average of 3,500

to 3,700 in the intervening decade.

And the

There has been, and I think that padding shows,

10
11

that there will not be any torrent of increased litigation

12

as a result of --

13

QUESTION:

Is any of that possibly the result of

14

the declining oil business in the Gulf or things like that

15

-- any of that decrease during that period of time?

16

MR. BABCOCK:

I think the shipyards have gone

17

down some.

18

gone up some, and that lessens the likelihood of claims

19

because there is a low inflationary adjustment for partial

20

disability as time moves along.
