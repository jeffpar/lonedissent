ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS PAUL ECKHART

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

13

MR. ECKHART:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

14

The question presented by this case is whether,

15

everything else being equal, a State may provide the same

16

amount of AFDC benefits to a family where the dependent

17

children are all related to their caretaker, but are not

18

siblings of one another, as the State does where the

19

children are all brothers and sisters of one another.

20

California and 28 other States have adopted a

21

rule that requires the combination of assistance units

22

when there are more - - when there are two or more

23

assistance units residing in the same household with the

24

same caretaker relative.

25

combination of assistance units if there are two caretaker

California also requires the

relatives and they are married to each other.
The full text of California's regulation is set

2

3

forth at the - - in the appendix to the petition for

4

certiorari at note 3 on page 17, note 3 in the district

5

court opinion.
The fundamental error committed by the Ninth

6

7

Circuit in this case, in the Beaton case, which was the

8

case the district court relied on in ruling in this case

9

and which the Ninth Circuit simply followed in affirming

10

the district court in this case, was to look at the

11

Federal income rules before looking at the question of

12

whether the State has the discretion and the right to

13

require AFD recipients who live together in the same

14

household to be considered one assistance unit for

15

purposes of computing the grant that they receive from the

16

State.

17

In essence, the Ninth Circuit put the cart

18

before the horse.

19

rules before looking at the State's discretion to decide

20

that assistance units and groups of AFDC recipients living

21

in the same household may be combined.

22

It looked at the income availability

The rule that we are proposing that the Court

23

adopt in this case is that under cooperative federalism,

24

which this Court has recognized is the AFDC system that

25

Congress has enacted, the States have the discretion to

1

make this kind of a rule, that assistance units living in

2

the same household be combined, a part of their AFDC

3

program.

4

To put that another way, we're asking this Court

5

to hold that neither Congress nor the Secretary of Health

6

& Human Services have --by express edict, where that is

7

the only way the State's discretion may be circumscribed

8

in the AFDC programs, have taken that discretion away from
the States.

10

I would like to illustrate first how the rule

11

works in - - with a practical example, and then I would

12

like to make four points.

13

would like -- just briefly going through the points I

14

would like to make this morning, first of all, deciding

15

who must be in an AFDC assistance unit is largely a matter

16

of State discretion, just as the State has a right to

17

decide how poor a person has to be before they receive

18

benefits and how much AFDC benefits the State should pay

1

that person.

20

First of all, the points I

The second point, when assistance units are

21

combined, the income and resources of all the persons in

22

that household who are claiming AFDC are considered as

23

available to every other member of that unit.

24

availability rules really relate to the situation after

25

the assistance units are combined, and determining whether

pile of money on a lottery ticket, could that person opt

out of welfare benefits and the State couldn't force those

who remained to consider that person's -MR. ECKHART:

14

MR. ECKHART:

Your question implicates the lump

sum rule.

16

that once the assistance unit is combined, the income and

17

resources that are available to each of those individuals

18

are considered available to the unit as a whole.

19

First of all, the answer to your question is

QUESTION:

Well, can someone opt out of the unit

20

and say, I don't want assistance any more, so don't count

21

me in?
MR. ECKHART:

22

Well, there are two answers to

23

that.

First of all, Your Honor, there is a Federal family

24

filing unit rule in section 602(a)(38) of 42 U.S.C. which

25

provides that if the -- where Congress provided in 1984

1

that the father, mother, and brothers and sisters, all of

2

whom live in the same household, their needs and income

3

must be considered together, such that if one of those

4

individuals receives a lottery winning or a lump sum

5

income of some kind, that person, that income is deemed

6

available to all the individuals.

QUESTION:

Let's say it is not a father, mother,

8

and their children.

We have these --a nephew or a cousin

or something in the household.

10

Can somebody who receives

outside money opt out of the unit?
MR. ECKHART:

Under current California

12

interpretation of Federal requirements and Federal

13

regulations, no.

14

make clear, first of all, that is not -- none of the

15

plaintiffs in this case present that set of facts.

16

class definition does not include a plaintiff such as

17

that, such as one who has outside income, and I believe

18

the Court can decide this case without reaching those

19

income -- the lump sum rule which is provided by Federal

20

law under subdivision 602(a)(17) of the, 42 U.S.C. --

would not be eligible for AFDC, because the persons

eligible for AFDC are limited to dependent children under

the age of 21 and their caretaker relative.

QUESTION:

So what would happen if he lived with

the mother and father and dependent children?
MR. ECKHART:

6

If he lived with that household,

7

his income would not be considered available to the

8

others, in the same way, Your Honor, as, for instance,

9

Mrs. Edwards, who is one of the named plaintiffs in this

10

case.

She is not a needy caretaker.

In other words, she

her children.

14

children in the unit.

Her income -- if she received a lottery

15

Simply, we're talking about the members of the

16

assistance unit, those persons claiming AFDC, and that's

17

what distinguishes this case from the cases this Court

18

decided in the late sixties and early seventies, where we

were dealing with, in King, a man in the house, a

If the family anticipates the receipt of the

child is determined to be eligible for AFDC as being

2

deprived of support and care of one of that person's

3

parents, and let's assume for the sake of argument that

4

the children and the caretaker are all financially needy.

5

The -- in one household there's a single mother

6

and her three children.

In that household, under Federal

7

law and under State law, there's only one assistance unit,

8

a four-person assistance unit because the caretaker is
also eligible for AFDC, and in California, currently that

10

four-person assistance unit would receive a maximum grant

11

of $723.

12

The other household right next door, single

13

mother, one child, takes in two grandchildren.

14

daughter has died, or is -- has abandoned the children.

15

In that household, there are two assistance units.

16

Initially, there are two assistance units, one made up of

17

the mother and her child, the other made up of the two

grandchildren.

family receives the same maximum aid payment as does the

25

support or not.

That's really not the issue here.

1

issue is, we have two families that are similarly sized

2

and essentially similarly situated, a single caretaker and

3

three minor children.

4

If there are -- if the State's rule cannot be

5

enforced and we have to have two assistance units in that

6

family, then the State has to pay out $980 to that second

7

family because there are two two-person assistance units,

8

each of which receive, under current California law, a

9

maximum aid payment of $490.

10

Obviously, the reason for the assistance unit

11

rule, the combination-of-assistance unit rule that we have

12

suggested, is that the State sees this as a way of

13

treating families who are similarly sized the same, and it

also saves money.

17

I'd like to reserve some time for rebuttal, the -- our

is the Federal rule that mandates a nuclear family, the

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

4

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

5

7

MR. ENGELMAYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our position is that filing rules such as

8

California's are consistent with the regulations governing

9

the AFDC program, and that is the longstanding view of the

10
11

Secretary of Health & Human Services.
California's rule simply ensures that single

12

caretaker families with the same number of dependent

13

children and the same financial resources receive the same

14

amount of aid, otherwise, as my cocounsel has observed,

15

there would be a disparity of aid simply between two

16

families, simply because the children in one family happen

17

to be siblings and the children in the other were not.

18

Eliminating that disparity was, in our view, one of a

19

number of permissible ways that California had to allocate

20

its finite AFDC resources.

21

Under this Court's decisions in Dandridge and in

22

Jefferson, the State alternatively could have put a flat

23

ceiling on the family grant regardless of the number of

24

children in the unit, in the family, and it alternatively

25

could have reduced across the board the level of benefits.

Let me explain a little bit about how the system

works.

If I were to take in my orphan nephew, the State

3

would pay to me a full grant of $299 a month, and it does

that despite the fact that I have income of my own

5

ineligible for AFDC.

the goals of the statute is to encourage the care of

children in the homes of their relatives, and also because

I have no legal obligation to support that child.

The State does that because one of

9

Similarly, as the State admits, if two adult

10

sisters live together, both of whom were poor, both of

11

whom had children and required AFDC, the State again would

12

pay two full grants and would set up two separate

13

assistance units, and similarly, they do this because

14

there is no legal duty to support.

15

But when it comes to the poorest people and the

16

neediest people, the State stops following this general

17

rule and forces consolidation and doesn't pay a full

18

grant.

is important, as counsel has noted, because once in, all

of the income and resources count.

though the Secretary responsible for the regulation has

argued otherwise.

You are, in effect, asking us to reject

MS. MEISS:

That's correct, Your Honor, we are

doing that.

We're saying that the language is clear that

this kind of imputation of income -- it's the automatic

assumption that's forbidden in this case, and that in

11

addition to the language, the contemporaneous construction

12

put on those words by the drafters of this also suggest

13

that this -- that the HHS's position is incorrect.

14

But in addition, we're also arguing that the

15

regula -- that what they've done in adopting the action

16

transmittal is they've adopted a statement that they

17

should have -- it's basically an amendment to the

18

regulation, it changes the three availability regulations,

19

and that should have been done pursuant to the

20

Administrative Procedures Act, and for both of those

reasons, this is not a deference, and we feel the Court is

the State were to say, are you willing to contribute your

all into this one assistance unit, and essentially what

11

the State is doing is undermining the decisions of this

Court as well.

13

The State doesn't do that.

The State says, simply

In King v. Smith and in Lewis v. Martin the

14

Court said -- in Lewis v. Martin in particular, the Court

15

said that a step-parent could -- income could not be used,

16

if they didn't owe a legal duty of support, to decrease

17

the grant to a needy child, and what the State is trying

18

to do is through the back door do the same thing by

19

saying, we'll sweep this -- they could, under their

20

rationale, sweep the step-parent in, and that clearly

21

would undermine the decision of this Court.

here is to save money, and that they feel they're allowed

to do that because of the economies of scale that exist in

And Congress has said, when States want to take

a valid proration plan under 42 U.S.C. 612, and in that

2

plan, Congress set out a way for States to achieve these

same savings, or similar savings, to the one they achieve

through the consolidated assistance unit rule.

5

But what the State is doing here is essentially

6

an end run around the proration mechanism, the proration

statute, and trying to do an end run around the three

availability regulations at issue in this case.

9

QUESTION:

And it is the three availability

regulations and not any statutory peg that you -- on which

11

you base your case?

12

MS. MEISS:

Well, we also base our case, Your

13

Honor, on the court's interpretation of the language of

14

what income and resources can be attributed to an

15

individual under 602(a) (7) (A), which is the basis on which

16

the State says it gets its discretion to define assistance

units, so we also have that statutory claim, and we also

18

make - - as interpreted by this Court and the regulations

basically flesh out or make concrete the availability

principle and how it's used in this.

rather, violates the intent of the AFDC

2

that California's rule has the exact opposite effect.
That is, it destabilizes the lives of the

3

families the program is designed to assist, it decreases

4

the amount of money available to these families, and it

5

creates such a disincentive, as you can see from the facts

6

of one of our plaintiffs, and will for many families, that

7

they will be forced to give up these needy orphaned and

abandoned nephews and nieces and place them in a foster

care system, and house them away from their home.

QUESTION:

But what do you do with the matching

inequities that the State presents to us if we were to

12

adopt your view of this - - they have it set out

graphically on page 39 of their brief -- and the

14

comparison that they make among units that they assert are

15

similarly situated?

16

MS. MEISS:

Well, in one sense it's a false

17

issue, because the issue in this case is not just the

18

number of individuals in the home, but the legal

19

responsibility that those individuals owe to one another.

20

The State admits, for instance, that it will pay

21

two caretaker relatives -- in the example that I used in

22

the beginning, two sisters who are living together on

a unit of five, they would pay a higher amount to that

group of people.

3

So it's not the number of people that's

4

important, but it's their legal responsibility to one

another, and the State is basically saying that they want

6

to get at the fact that there are only five people here,

7

and five people -- with five people there's an economies

8

of scale, and --

QUESTION:

Well, I gather the State is also

10

saying, and I guess the Government is agreeing, that if

11

California wanted to, it could consider that to be a

12

single unit, too.

13

They've really chosen to say, we'll treat it as

14

a single unit when there's one caretaker for everybody,

15

but I suppose their position is that they -- the

16

definition of the assistant unit is up to them, and even

17

though there are two caretakers, they could, where the two

caretakers choose to live together with the children, they

4

There's --

5

QUESTION:

6

And there's not between a brother and

sister, but that's by statute, I suppose.

7

MS. MEISS:

That's correct.

The Congress has

8

decided that in certain instances we will presume that

9

there's -- we're going to allow this kind of automatic

10

assumption that income is available, and one of those is

11

the mandatory filing unit rule, which says that nuclear

12

families can be forced to share their income and

13

resources, but this is not a nuclear family we're dealing

14

with, and so it's distinguishable.

15

âThere's one thing that I would like to correct

16

that's in the reply brief of the petitioners, and that is

17

a footnote on page 15 -- on page 15, footnote 5, which

18

suggests that the harmful effect or the invidious effect

19

of this regulation is muted somewhat by the fact that, as

20

they say, there's a new action transmittal which would

21

allow the extended family members in this case to get

22

foster care, and I just want to clarify that that's

23

incorrect.

24
25

What that action transmittal merely said was
that when a parent is taking care of foster children, that

1

that parent is themselves eligible for regular AFDC for

2

their own needs, and that's a change from prior law, but

3

it doesn't -- it has no effect on this case, because by-

4

definition the children in this case are not eligible for

5

foster care.

6

If these children were, they would have applied

7

for it, because they would get so much more money from

8

foster care, but by definition these children don't meet

9

the complicated linkage requirements for foster care, and

10

therefore the - - and I want to point that out because the

11

effect of the policy is to create such economic insecurity

12

in families that those individuals, as happened in the

13

Moore family here, are forced to give those children up to

14

foster care.

15

QUESTION:

Is there any empirical information?

16

I take it underlying their theory is that a man or a woman

17

who's looking after four children will probably treat

18

them, and life will go on roughly the same, whether those

19

four children are four direct children, or two children

20

and two nephews, and on its face you'd think -- I don't

21

know the details and facts, but probably that's by and

22

large true.

23

At least, they argue that it is, or at least the

24

State could find that.

25

suggests it isn't true?

Is there any information that

MS. MEISS:

1

Well, as a practical matter, the

2

children that we're dealing with are children who are

3

taken in by these relatives, are by definition abandoned

4

or orphaned, they're victims of abuse or neglect, and so

5

most of them come to the households with greater needs,

6

with far greater needs, emotional needs, and many of them

7

are simply dropped off, as happened in one of our

8

plaintiffs' case, merely with the clothes on their back

9

and nothing else.
And so there is a difference between a regular

10
11

nuclear family, I think, and this kind of a family, and

that is, in a nuclear family one generally plans the

2

care.

3

I'd like to talk for a minute about what it is

4

that actually occurs when the State combines the unit and

5

what actually happens to individuals, and in a minute get

6

back to this question of lump sum income.

7

First, when they combine the units, it violates

8

the regulations at issue because in so doing it

9

consolidates the unit.

It reduces the grant based on the

10

fact that this individual lives with the other folks,

11

despite that there's no legal obligation of support

12

between those individuals, and perhaps the best example is

13

from our named plaintiffs, the Edwards household.

14

The Edwards household, when the child first came

15

in they mistakenly under their rule paid, but correctly

16

under our interpretation, two different units, two

17

different grants, and had two assistance units, so the

18

Edwards grant, when they consolidated, went for the

19

household from $901 a month to $630 a month.

20

The child, the needy niece who came into the new

21

household, her grant went from $341 a month to $210 a

22

month, so what they're doing in that situation is actually

23

reducing the amount of assistance payment paid to the

24

household and to the individual child based on the

25

presence of the family members and the household together,
43

even though there's no legal duty to support.
Secondly, in violation of the substitute parent
regulation, which says that you can only presume and make
this automatic assumption that the income of a parent is
going to be available, they assume that all people in the
household will contribute to one another, and here the
example that was asked -- I think it was Justice Ginsburg
asked about, if you were -- if the Solicitor General
were -- allowed the family to remove themselves from a
lump sum income, they couldn't do that if outside income
came into the home, and that's correct.
So in that situation, when somebody gets, for
instance, Social Security death benefits, which are
probably the largest single source of outside income in
the AFDC program, if an individual such as the child of
the caretaker relative were to receive those death
benefits, then not only would that -- would the -- would
they be attributable to the parent, the mother, and to the
child, but they're also attributable to the nephew, and
that point there's nothing -QUESTION:
