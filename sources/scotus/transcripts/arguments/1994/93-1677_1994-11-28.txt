ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY P. JOHNSTON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. JOHNSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Before the Court today is the question of

11

whether the State of Oklahoma may constitutionally impose

12

on the in-State purchaser and require the in-State vendor

13

to collect a sales tax on the purchase of bus

14

transportation sold within the State, the tax being

15

measured by the full purchase price of the ticket even

16

though the ultimate destination of the trip, or a portion

17

thereof, is to be traveled beyond the State's borders.

18

The facts of the case are basically very simple.

19

The State of Oklahoma has a general sales tax which taxes

20

the sale of tangible personal property and certain

21

services, including bus transportation by common carriers.

22

This tax, as most or all common sales taxes, is imposed

23

upon the consumer, is collected by the vendor, it is a

24

percentage of the purchase price, and is added to that.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Johnston, does Oklahoma tax the

MR. JOHNSTON:

They are not to my knowledge,

stipulation the only sales involved in this case were

2

those which originated in Oklahoma and terminated outside

3

of the State.
QUESTION:

4

The stipulation seems inconsistent

5

with something stated in the bankruptcy court opinion, and

6

I just didn't know which one to think was the correct one.

7

MR. JOHNSTON:

I - - my memory of the opinion was

8

that it did recognize that Jefferson sold other types of

9

interstate trips in the State of Oklahoma.

For instance,

10

round trips would be one type.

11

part of that, but that was a stipulation that is in the

12

record, that these sales, the exact sales in question in

13

this case were all those which originated in Oklahoma and

14

extended outside the State, or had a destination outside

15

the State.

16

The stipulation wasn't

In that respect, Jefferson, while operating in

17

Oklahoma and selling its bus trips and selling its bus

18

tickets from various outlets and locations across the

19

State for both intrastate and interstate trips -- that is,

20

extending beyond the State's borders, collected sales tax

21

only on those bus tickets which were sold for intrastate

22

trips.

23

Jefferson, of course, had a sales tax permit

24

issued by - - as a vendor by the State of Oklahoma, the

25

Oklahoma Tax Commission, and dutifully reported all sales

1

made in Oklahoma, both intrastate and interstate trips.

2

On the sales tax report, however, Jefferson then deducted

3

those sales which were connected with interstate trips,

4

did not collect or remit sales taxes on those sales, only

5

the net.

6

Jefferson filed for bankruptcy, and office

7

audits by the tax commission of Jefferson's sales tax

8

report developed that the interstate trips, the tax was

9

not being collected or remitted, and a claim was filed.

10

Jefferson objected in the bankruptcy court to the claim.

11

The bankruptcy court sustained Jefferson's claim that it

12

violated - - that the tax on these trips violated the

13

Commerce Clause.

14

tax in view of the four-prong test of Complete Auto.

15

The court, of course, analyzed the State

Analyzing and realizing that Jefferson is

16

physically present in the State of Oklahoma when it makes

17

all of these bus sales, these ticket sales, and that

18

Jefferson's customers are physically present in the State

19

when the sale is made, the bankruptcy court found that

20

this presence satisfied both the nexus requirement of

21

Complete Auto and also established that the State was

22

providing services both to Jefferson and to its customers

23

in connection with the sales transaction, and therefore

24

the fourth prong was satisfied that the tax was fairly

25

related to services provided by the taxing State.

As to the second prong of the Complete Auto

1

2

test, however, that the tax be fairly apportioned, the

3

court looked at the accepted test of whether or not the

4

tax is internally consistent.

5

other State enacted the same tax, would there be multiple

6

or double taxation.

7

because, of course, a bus ticket can be sold in only one

8

State.

9

That is whether, if every

The court found that there is not,

As to the second portion, however, the

10

bankruptcy court determined that the tax as it applies to

11

interstate trips was not fully -- fairly apportioned

12

because the court envisioned that the tax was essentially

13

the same as the tax in a prior case, Central Greyhound

14

Lines v. Mealey.

today, we are talking about a sales tax.

and it is not the thing that is purchased or the use of

the thing purchased.

However, in the case before this Court
It is a tax on

The taxable transaction is the sale itself,

QUESTION:

In Central Greyhound -Mr. Johnston, one more background

20

fact.

In the two bankruptcy proceedings that I think

21

involved another bus company there was a statement that

22

you tax even tickets that were sold outside the State.

23

Was -- the bankruptcy judge thought that the tax reached

24

transportation of -- where the ticket was sold out of

25

State.

Was that incorrect?

MR. JOHNSTON:

I

it's incorrect under the

2

law, Your Honor, and you're speaking of the Greyhound

3

case, which is an almost identical case which is currently

4

pending in the Fifth Circuit.

5

case were a bit broader than the stipulations.

6

not restrict themselves to trips, only to trips

7

originating in Oklahoma and terminating outside insofar as

8

interstate trips are concerned, but the -- I'm sorry --

9

QUESTION:

The stipulations in that
They did

Does the tax reach, as the bankruptcy

10

judges seem to think, transportation sold in other States,

11

but that occurs at least in part in Oklahoma?

12

MR. JOHNSTON:

No, Your Honor, it does not.

13

Under the statute and under the Oklahoma supreme court

14

decisions the Oklahoma sales tax is effective and

15

applicable only if the sale occurs in Oklahoma, and in

16

this case, that is if the trip is sold in Oklahoma.

17

is, if I go and buy a ticket.

That

18

I'm not talking, of course, just the piece of

19

paper but what the ticket represents and, of course, in

20

common parlance one does not buy transportation to New

21

York, one buys a ticket to New York.

22

QUESTION:

So this statement, the statute also

23

allows Oklahoma to tax transportation sold in other States

24

which occurs in Oklahoma, that's just flat wrong, is that

25

your position?

MR. JOHNSTON:

1

2

That's just flat wrong, Your

Honor.
Under the statute and under the supreme court

3
4

decisions in regard to the Oklahoma sales tax, the sale to

be taxable in Oklahoma must occur in Oklahoma.

6

occur outside the State.
QUESTION:

7

It cannot

It simply doesn't apply.

May I ask if your tax would cover --

8

forget interstate commerce and transportation for a

9

moment.

Supposing you bought your Super Bowl tickets in

10

Oklahoma, would the tax apply, the Super Bowl being played

11

in some other State?

12

MR. JOHNSTON:

Yes, Your Honor, I believe it

13

would, because my memory of the statute is that it does

14

tax admission to places of amusement, and if the sale were

15

made in Oklahoma, then it would be taxable in Oklahoma,

16

because, as with the Super Bowl ticket or a bus ticket,

17

the way people purchase these services - -

18

QUESTION:

And going back to Justice O'Connor's

19

question, there doesn't have to be any part of the service

20

performed within the State?

21

MR. JOHNSTON:

Not in such circumstances, where

22

you have certainly physical evidence in the form of the

23

ticket, but legal evidence where the service is bought and

24

paid for and at that point the purchaser has the right to

25

the service and the right to do with that service as he

The ticket, for instance, whether it be a

3

football game or a bus ticket, the purchaser once they buy

and pay for the ticket they can give it away, they could

sell it, I suppose they could leave it in a will.

QUESTION:

So, then, a travel agency doing

business in Oklahoma pays the tax on all the sales it

makes regardless of what the tickets are?

somebody buys tickets from an Oklahoma travel agent for

use going from New York to London or some place, he'd

still pay the tax in Oklahoma?

MR. JOHNSTON:

1

Yes, sir, under this statute.

If

2

the sale occurs there, and it would be in that case, as I

3

understand the question, then it would be taxable, yes,

4

sir.
QUESTION:

5

Well, exactly what is the provision

6

of the Oklahoma tax, because in answer to that question of

n

Justice Stevens, you said if it applies to transportation,

8

but then certainly a Super Bowl ticket to admit one into

9

the Super Bowl doesn't deal with transportation.

/

10

What is

the relevant provision of the Oklahoma tax statute?
MR. JOHNSTON:

11

As to transportation it is -- and

12

that's contained on pages 2 and 3 of the brief for

13

petitioner -- in section 1354, title 68 of the Oklahoma

14

statutes is the general levying statute, which levies the

15

sales tax of 4 percent, it is now 4-1/2 percent of the

16

gross receipts or gross proceeds of sale of a) tangible

17

personal property, c) transportation for hire to persons

18

by common carriers -- I've omitted the rest of that, but

19

it includes -QUESTION:

20
21

Well, how would that reach tickets to

the Super Bowl?
MR. JOHNSTON:

22

In other sections or subsections,

23

rather, of the sales tax statute, the tax is levied on the

24

sale of admission to amusement -- sports and amusement

25

places.

I thought I had made that clear.

But it is not

1

in this subsection, but it is within the taxing statute as

2

a specifically enumerated service.
The courts below, both the bankruptcy court, or

3
4

all three of the courts, the bankruptcy court, the

5

district court on appeal, and then the Eighth Circuit

6

Court of Appeal, all held that the tax was not fairly

7

apportioned under the external consistency test.

8

three, however, based their decisions and relied upon the

9

case of Central Greyhounds v. Mealey.

All

As I believe I

10

earlier said, this was -- that case involved a different

11

kind of a tax, a different kind of a taxpayer, on a

12

totally different transaction.

13

The district court, I believe it was, indicated

14

that it found no substantial difference between a sales

15

tax in this case and a gross income tax in the Central

16

Greyhound case.

17

QUESTION:

With respect to Central Greyhound, is

18

it your position that if New York had made that tax a tax

19

on the sale of the ticket, then it would have come out the

20

other way?

21

MR. JOHNSTON:

I believe it would, Your Honor.

22

If it had been a sales tax on the consumer as

23

opposed to an income tax on the provider of the service,

24

then I believe that the focus of the constitutional

25

examination which looks at the transaction would be

1

looking at the transaction involving the consumer and his

2

purchase, as opposed to the bus company and taxing its

3

revenues from the providing of the service, and that, I

4

believe, is the difference.

5

If it had been a different tax, I believe -- if

6

it had been a tax similar to this, then the results would

7

have been different.
QUESTION:

difference?

But as a practical matter, what's the

The measure is the same, which is the sale

price of the ticket.

It's exactly the same measure.

MR. JOHNSTON:

11

It is, Your Honor, but I believe

12

that under all the precedents you have to look at the

13

transaction that is being taxed.

14

transaction that is being taxed is the purchase of the

15

service, not the providing of the service nor the making

16

of money from the providing of the service.

In this situation, the

17

QUESTION:

18

in Central Greyhound, is it?

19

which you do the figuring.

20

due when the ticket is purchased, the tax is due when you

21

add up all your gross income and find out what it is.

22

Isn't that the only difference?

23

But there's no separate transaction

MR. JOHNSTON:

24

only difference.

Honor.

It's simply the moment at

QUESTION:

Is there -- was there any other kind

of income that went into gross income in Central Greyhound

that is -- in addition to revenue from the sale of

QUESTION:

I'm afraid I'm not -- I'm not
If there was, I'm not aware --

Then I'm not -- then, like the court

8

below, I'm not sure what the difference is, then.

9

that to me again.

10

MR. JOHNSTON:

Explain

Because in Central Greyhound we

11

are talking about taxing the bus company on its revenues,

12

its gross receipts in that case, not net revenues, but

13

from the providing of -- providing its own income, the

14

generation of income, in that case more than one State.

15

QUESTION:

Well, is the difference, then, that

16

in the case of the tax here, the bus company is given an

17

authorization to add on the tax up front and state it as a

18

tax when it collects it, as distinct from simply dealing

19

with it as a cost of business and passing it on sub

20

silentio when it figures the price of its ticket?

MR. JOHNSTON:

In this case the bus company is

not only permitted to do that, it is required.

provision of the statute.

Well, I realize that, but is that,

then, the only distinction between the two?

It's up front

1

in one case and it's an unstated cost of doing business

2

which increases the cost of the ticket in the other case?
MR. JOHNSTON:

3

I think that's not only correct,

4

Your Honor, but it also is constitutionally significant,

5

because - QUESTION:

6

7

That's the only difference.

That's

what I'm trying to get at.
MR. JOHNSTON:

8

yes, sir.

It is the primary difference,

As far as the economic result of an income tax

10

for a corporation, of course, it is basically always going

11

to trickle down to its customers in the form of higher

12

prices for whatever the corporation is doing.
However, the tax on the corporation's income,

13
14

even though the ultimate cost of that tax may eventually

15

increase the cost of its services to the customers, for

16

instance in the Liggett & Myers case, that does not,

17

according to the court, make that a tax on the customer,

18

and I believe we have --

Central Greyhound was, yes, sir.

And that this is a tax on the

purchaser, not on the company?

MR. JOHNSTON:

2

QUESTION:

That is the difference.

Why does that make a difference?

I

3

mean, a State -- the State of New York has a big interest,

4

I take it, in the income that its own corporations make,

5

so the connection between New York and its company,

6

Greyhound, is great.

7

Here, with the sales tax, I guess Oklahoma has

8

far less interest either in the company or in the trip, so

9

if there's a difference, why does it cut in your favor?

10
11

Why doesn't it cut against you?
MR. JOHNSTON:

The difference is, as far as

12

Oklahoma's interest, is that Oklahoma is levying a

13

transaction tax on the purchaser in Oklahoma and not on

14

the bus company.

15

the State of Oklahoma and nowhere else.

16

That transaction occurs totally within

QUESTION:

All right.

Is it the case here, I'm

17

not certain, but suppose I'm in Massachusetts and my son's

18

at school in California, and I think it would be nice to

19

send him an apple every month, so I get these things in

20

the mail you do, they'll send Washington apples to

21

California once a month.

22

Massachusetts if I buy the apples in Massachusetts?

23

They're Washington apples going to California.

24

MR. JOHNSTON:

25

QUESTION:

Can that be taxed in

I would doubt it.

The answer's no, I take it.

All

right.

Why is it any different if I buy him a haircut

once a month?

3

think he should get a haircut out at Stanford, so there's

a new service, which there ought to be, that they'll give

QUESTION:

I mean, does it make any difference?

I think that the difference as it

MR. JOHNSTON:

1

Yes, Your Honor.

I made the

distinction only between tangible personal property and

3

service to this extent, that it's well settled that for

4

tangible personal property you have the delivery of either

5

title or possession.

That is - - and the right to control.

In the situation of the bus ticket and

intangibles, intangible services, then we are talking

8

about the same transaction, it's the same transfer, but it

9

is the right to have and control that service, not

necessarily the ultimate enjoyment.
For instance, it is not the tax on the eating of

the apple or the riding of the bus.

The McGoldrick --

Court that require us to make a distinction between

want us to make?

14

MR. JOHNSTON:

The McGoldrick case would be one

case, Your Honor, because the agreement was made first,

then the coal was mined or released, then it was shipped

17

from a place out of State into New York, and actual

18

physical delivery of the coal to the buying customer was

19

made in New York, so the interstate portion of that

delivery the Court found to be basically incidental and

21

not violative of interstate commerce.

22

Other cases to which we would point the Court's

attention, and we have in the brief, are those situations

involving, for instance, airline fuel in Wardair Canada.

to a sales tax.

It was of an intangible service.

QUESTION:

What about the Court's stress of the

MR. JOHNSTON:

I believe because of the

circumstances or the nature of that transaction, and the

statute provided the possibility as the Court noted,

19

although I believe the Court said that there was a very,

20

very slight possibility, but a possibility, that an

21

interstate telephone call could be subject to tax in two

22

States, but only two States, and the Court then, of

23

course, observed that even if there was that slight

24

possibility, then the credit provision would act to take

care to avoid any actual multiple taxation.

Under the scenario that is adopted by the courts

Yes.

The answer to that is yes,

Mr. DeRuyter, one argument that was

able to tax the customer who is traveling on Oklahoma

all of the miles within Oklahoma, that they'd probably net

10

more than they are now, when they're taxing only the

person who purchased the ticket in Oklahoma.

12

Have you shown that that is not so, that in fact

13

if they went on your theory of taxing people who travel

the roads in Oklahoma, no matter where they begin, no

the Court, and what they're -- I mean, what they're

Associated Industries the argument was made that a use tax

that the tax here is imposed upon the individual

Yes.

I look at Evco, Ingram-

I believe that you do, that by

saying that you impose a tax on the sale of the ticket, at

bottom what you are saying is that you are imposing a tax

on the contract, making of the contract and the making of

No other view can tax the act of

QUESTION:

Right.

6

MR. DeRUYTER:

However, I'm -- the -- this Court

has said you must look at the operating incidence of the

tax.

9

measure of the tax,

The operating incidence of this tax is on the
and the measure of the tax is the

10

gross receipts from the total trip, and therefore our

11

argument is that the - - the argument of the State of

12

Oklahoma is too narrow, that you can't look only at the

13

actual transaction, but you must look at the operating

14

incidence of the tax, and that is clearly on the total

15

gross receipts, which is not apportioned.
QUESTION:

16
17

And your apportionment formula that

you suggest is mileage traveled in each State?

The determination of an

19

apportionment formula is in essence a legislative

decision.

situation, there is in this factual situation an

22

administratively feasible method of apportionment which is

3

MR. DeRUYTER:

Because when a person purchases a

QUESTION:

But they do.

They've got the ticket,

and if the bus company won't carry them, they can sue the

to me, they've got the full value of the transaction, and

12

they're going to realize that value either by traveling or

13

by making the bus company pay.

14

I mean, economically, it seems

The distinction, I suppose is, when they buy the

1

whereas in the purchase of a service, the dominion and

2

control of the object of that transaction can never be

3

complete until the passenger completes their travel, and

4

if that is interrupted in the middle, they have a right to

5

a refund of the portion of the sales tax, on the portion

6

of the trip they didn't complete.

7

QUESTION:

Would you agree, then, that if the

8

bus company were selling the tickets in the first place to

9

travel agents and travel agents were then selling them to

10

the travelers, that at least the transaction as between

11

the bus company and the travel agent would be complete at

12

that point, and that would be fully taxable?

13

MR. DeRUYTER:

14

QUESTION:

I don't believe that's the case.

Well, that isn't the case here, but

15

if that were the case, would that particular transaction

16

as between the company and the agent, as distinct from the

17

agent and the traveler, even on your theory, be fully

18

taxable without apportionment?

19

MR. DeRUYTER:

I don't think so, because the

20

travel agent is simply an agent in that situation, either

21

for the passenger or for Jefferson Lines, and it should

22

not make a difference on how the transaction is taxed.

The object of the transaction, the object of the

tax and the tax is not laid on the travel agency but

MR. DeRUYTER:

QUESTION:

Exactly.

Yes, and it doesn't seem to be a

difficult -- I mean, it looks as though there's a very

simple way that they might apportion, and so the question

6

is, do we follow -- do we say, well, if it was tough in

7

the phone case, it's equally tough in this case, and say

8

there can't be an apportionment, or do we say we were

9

wrong about apportionment in the first case, it's easy in

10

each instance, and therefore we see it your way here?

11

Which way do we go?

12

MR. DeRUYTER:

I've thought about - - I thought

13

about -- you know, when I've read Goldberg, my view of

14

that is simply that I don't think the State of Oklahoma

15

argues that apportionment on a mileage basis is difficult,

16

or impossible to do.

17

in this case.

18

They simply argue it's not relevant

As opposed to the telephone situation, as I

19

indicated before, if the facts were different in Goldberg

20

I think the result might have been different in Goldberg,

21

and if you have the technology to allocate to States where

22

there's a real nexus to tax in Goldberg, I think you might

have a different --my view of it, there would be a
