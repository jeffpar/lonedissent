ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ESTRADA:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The respondent was a California lawyer who

11
12

became involved in drug dealing and other crimes.

13

money obtained from his crimes, he invested in a venture

14

to mine gold in Alaska.

15

narcotics offenses and of violating the Racketeering

16

Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO.

17

RICO makes it a crime for any person to use income derived

18

from a pattern of racketeering activity to acquire an

1

interest in any enterprise "which is engaged in, or the

20

activities of which affect interstate or foreign

21

commerce."

22

With

He was eventually convicted of

The Ninth Circuit affirmed the narcotics

23

conviction, but it reversed the RICO conviction for lack

24

of proof that the activities of the gold mining venture

25

affected interstate commerce.

The court held that a

1

minimal effect on interstate commerce would be sufficient

2

to satisfy RICO, but that an incidental effect on that

3

commerce would not.

4

The court then found that the Government's

5

evidence, including the fact that the gold mining venture

6

had hired employees outside of Alaska and purchased

7

equipment outside of Alaska, showed, at most, an

8

incidental effect on interstate commerce.

The Ninth

Circuit emphasized that Alaska's geographical isolation
10

means that most supplies and equipment must get there via

11

interstate commerce, and it believed that Alaska's

12

dependence on interstate commerce should not mean that

13

local businesses in Alaska are covered by RICO.

14

We brought the case here because the Ninth

15

Circuit decision conflicts with the view of every other

16

court of appeals that has considered what sort of a

17

jurisdictional proof satisfies the requirements of RICO.

QUESTION:

MR. ESTRADA:

20
21

I think it's we rather than you who

Well, I stand corrected, Mr. Chief

Justice.

22

Our argument in the case, now that it is here,

23

Mr. Chief Justice, starts with the language of RICO, and

24

that language reaches all enterprises the activities of

25

which affect interstate or foreign commerce.

This Court's

1

cases made clear that the phrase, affect commerce, is a

2

term of art that Congress uses to exercise all commerce

3

power it has under the Constitution, and that Congress

4

intended to exercise all of its constitutional power in

5

RICO is confirmed not only by its use of that term of art,

6

but also by the fact that one of its principal goals in

7

enacting RICO, which was to safeguard small businesses

8

from infiltration by organized crime, could likely not be

9

achieved under any narrower view of the jurisdictional

10
11

requirement.
Under RICO, then, in our view, the question is

12

whether the activities of the enterprise, here the gold

13

mining venture, affect commerce when measured by the full

14

constitutional authority of Congress and, under that

15

standard, the evidence in this case was sufficient to meet

16

the Government's burden.

17

The Ninth Circuit conceded that respondent and

18

his employees traveled between Alaska and the Lower 48

19

States in connection with the work in the mine, that the

20

mine obtained supplies and equipment from the Lower 48

21

States, and the respondent mortgaged a home he owned in

22

Arizona to finance the second mining season in 1986.

23

In addition, the evidence showed that the mine

24

sold a substantial amount of gold in Alaska worth at least

25

$200,000, that the purchasers of the gold were part of a

1

broader market in precious metals that reached beyond

2

Alaska, and that therefore the mine's output was part of a

3

class of activities that in the aggregate substantially

4

affects interstate commerce.

5

In addition, the evidence showed that respondent

6

and his associates used the instrumentalities of

7

interstate commerce repeatedly, the mail and the

8

telephones, as part of the business of the mine.

9
10
11

In our view, all of that evidence was clearly
sufficient to satisfy the Government's burden under -QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, in your view, is there

12

any business enterprise in America that wouldn't be

13

covered by RICO?

14

What are the limits?

MR. ESTRADA:

As a factual matter, Justice

15

O'Connor, I cannot think of any business in the country

16

that could not be covered by RICO, given that what is at

17

issue is the full constitutional authority of Congress.

18

understand that the Commerce principle is a limited one,

19

and we do agree with that.

20

I

However, the facts on which it operates are not

21

limited, and in our economy on this day, I cannot think of

22

anything that is likely to actually happen in the real

23

world that would not be covered by this Court's cases

24

construing the extent of Congress' power under the

25

Commerce Clause.

I don't think Gibbons v. Ogden relied

Gibbons v. Ogden was just a broad definition of the

MR. ESTRADA:

That's right, although in later

10

cases in the 1940's this Court expressed the view that --

11

the broad view that Mr. Chief Justice Marshall had

12

expounded in the Ogden case was in fact merely an

QUESTION:

We don't

Doesn't our recent decision in the

11

Allied Bruce case have some relevance to this problem of

12

what affects commerce?

13

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, I -- but the only reason that

14

it is necessary to point to the Necessary and Proper

15

Clause, Justice Ginsburg, is that the Commerce Clause in

16

itself, as Justice Scalia pointed out, authorizes Congress

17

to regulate only commerce, and the so-called affectation

18

doctrine that allows Congress to deal with other matters

19

that are not in themselves commerce, but they have an

20

effect on commerce, is usually justified by reference to

21

the Necessary and Proper Clause even though the cases talk

22

about it as the commerce power.

sense that that term is used in the Constitution.

It is a

commerce power and the Necessary and Proper Clause.
QUESTION:

Well, you say the power is justified.

It's justified by whom?
MR. ESTRADA:

By - - this Court's cases have made

5

reference in explaining why Congress has been held to have

6

authority to reach matters that are not in themselves

7

commerce to the Necessary and Proper Clause.

8

QUESTION:

These are the cases that you can't

remember from the thirties and forties?
10

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but in

11

fact, and the Court has explained on occasion, that even

12

though the cases speak of Congress' power to reach

13

anything that affects commerce, some of the more cases --

14

some of the Court's cases have been more specific, and

15

have pointed out that Congress under the Commerce Clause

16

can reach only commerce in itself, but that under the

17

Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress can then reach other

18

things that are not in themselves commerce, but that

1

affect commerce, and this Court's cases dealing with

20

whether something affects commerce and saying that

21

Congress has power to reach those matters are usually --

22

are logically traceable to reasoning based ultimately on

23

the Necessary and Proper Clause.

24
25

I was going to turn to the justifications given
by the court of appeals.

The court of appeals though that

1

despite all of the evidence of interstate conduct in this

2

case, the fact that the enterprise hired employees and

3

purchased equipment outside of Alaska, that a different

4

result was warranted by its description of the effects on

5

commerce as incidental rather than minimal.

6

And that was wrong, because this Court stated in

7

Wickard v. Filburn that questions as to the constitutional

8

power of Congress really should not be solved by reference

9

to any formula that gives controlling weight to

10

nomenclature, and that the real question is whether actual

11

effects can be identified on commerce, and in this case,

12

they surely could.

13

The second reason that the Ninth Circuit gave

14

was based on the isolation of the State of Alaska, and we

15

do not think that that isolation should count against our

16

case.

17

Alaska have to obtain supplies and equipment from

18

interstate commerce, but that State is hardly unique in

19

that respect, and much the same could be said about Rhode

20

Island or Wyoming.

21

It is certainly true that many of the businesses in

No State of the Union is entirely self-

22

sufficient, and in our view it makes little sense to say

23

that the greater a State's dependence on interstate

24

commerce, the less likely it will be that the activities

25

within that State will be deemed to affect interstate

commerce.
QUESTION:

Now, does the Sherman Antitrust Act

3

have a lesser scope of coverage?

4

MR. ESTRADA:

No.

We think that the Sherman

5

Act, the Hobbs Act, and RICO, all go to the limits of the

6

Commerce Clause, and therefore if --

7
8

QUESTION:

But the language in each is somewhat

different, is it not?
MR. ESTRADA:

That is right.

The language in

each of them is somewhat different.

11

word "obstruct" commerce, some of them use "impede"

12

commerce, and some of them use "affect" commerce, and as

13

this Court has made clear in the NLRB cases, particularly

14

the Polish case versus the NLRB, all of those are terms of

15

art that are used to invoke the full authority of Congress

16

under the Commerce Clause, and therefore all of those

17

terms have been interpreted by this Court, when Congress

18

uses them, as going to the limits of the Commerce Clause.

19

QUESTION:

Some of them use the

Do I have to agree with that to agree

with the Government in this case?

22

MR. ESTRADA:

Because I don't agree

Yes, I do know, Justice Scalia.

In this case, no, because in our view the evidence in this

case, and this is how we tried to prove most of these

25

cases, was actually sufficient to show that the enterprise

It is --

It's language is "in restraint of

trade between the States," isn't it?

9

MR. ESTRADA:

That's right, and I know the view

10

that you expressed in Summit Health.

11

view in that case, the view was that the activity in that

12

case could be reached by Congress, but that in passing the

13

Sherman Act, Congress did not exercise its full authority.

14

As I understand your

In this case, it seems fairly plain to us at

15

least that Congress in using the words,

16

commerce," did what you thought it had not done in the

17

Sherman Act, because by the time RICO was passed, Congress

18

had been told again and again by this Court that if it

19

wished to invoke its full power under the Commerce Clause,

20

these were the words it had to use, and therefore, no,

21

even if you continue to hold your view as to the Sherman

Act, Justice Scalia, that should not keep you from sort

distinguish that case from this?

3

MR. ESTRADA:

How do you

That case stated that when

4

Congress engages, or defines a class of activities, the

5

Court's role in effect is significantly different, but

6

from the examples that the Court cited in that

7

footnote 12, especially the Perez case, it is evident that

8

what the Court was getting at is that when Congress itself

9

does what it did in the Perez case, that no further proof

10

of interstate commerce at all is called for in any given

11

case.

12

That doesn't really answer the question here,

13

because Congress exercised its full power under the

14

Commerce Clause, and that full power could be met by a

15

class of activities analysis, or any other way in which

16

Congress could lawfully exercise its power, and the

17

significant difference that the Court was talking to in

18

that case was the difference between having to prove the

19

fact in every case and having to have no evidence

20

whatsoever of the fact in any one case.

21

QUESTION:

In this case, Mr. Estrada, was there

22

an argument before the jury that interstate commerce was

not affected?

QUESTION:

So the Ninth Circuit's view was that

14

MR. ESTRADA:

That's right.

That' right, and we

15

think that that's clearly wrong under this Court's cases.

16

The Ninth Circuit's view is that the evidence in this case

Mr. Estrada, would the following

12

argument be sound?

13

Congress wanted to make it unequivocally clear that it was

14

legislating to the fullest extent of its powers, it would

15

have described the activity of the enterprise in this way:

16

it would have spoken of an enterprise which engages in

17

activities that affect interstate commerce.

18

It would go like this, that if

That would have made it clear that the

19

enterprise was simply one participant in a broader

20

activity, or congeries of activities that have, in the

21

aggregate, this substantial effect, but that what Congress

22

in fact did was to speak of an enterprise, the activities

23

of which affect commerce, which suggests that we are

24

speaking or looking not to an aggregate, but to the

25

particular activities of that enterprise, and to them

alone.

2

Is that sort of contrast in language the basis

3

for a sound argument that Congress was taking a narrower

4

view here?

5

MR. ESTRADA:

I don't think so, Justice Souter.

6

Congress usually will write the words,

7

at the end of the language that otherwise makes conduct a

8

crime on the understanding that that goes to the full

9

power of its commerce --

QUESTION:

"affect commerce"

So that whenever you see it, it's

11

basically a signal for the shorthand, whatever we can do

12

we're doing?

13

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, and I would give as an

14

example to you the Scarborough case, which dealt with

15

coming into possession of a firearm in commerce, or in

16

affecting commerce.

17

This Court held in that case, in the Scarborough

18

case, that even though the language said, possession

19

affecting commerce, that that requirement would be

20

satisfied by proof that the firearm had traveled in

21

interstate commerce at some point in human history, even

22

if it had nothing whatsoever to do with the conduct of the

23

defendant, and if that had happened before the defendant

24

came to have the firearm, and I think cases like that

properly give Congress an understanding - 18

QUESTION:

And you really think that that's what

our cases now, that whenever Congress uses the word

"affecting" the rest of the sentence doesn't matter?

4

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, I think that it matters in

5

the sense that the activities of the enterprise of course

6

have to affect commerce, but one of the tests that may

7

make that true under this Court's cases, and especially

8

the NLRB cases, is that they may affect commerce because,

9

considered with other like activities throughout the

10
11

country, the effect on commerce is substantial.
QUESTION:

If that's what we've said, maybe we

12

should unsay it, because it certainly is a trap for the

13

unwary legislator who thinks that he's speaking English,

14

and it turns out that if he uses the word "affecting" all

sorts of unreal things happen.

arguing here.

QUESTION:

Of course, what we've come with in

8

your answers to me and to Justice Scalia are a kind of

three variants, one of which would make it expressly clear

that we were talking about an enterprise whose activities,

of the spectrum, the answer that you gave to Justice

in the statute is something in between.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The question before the Court is whether the

Commerce Clause has any limitations.

7

"interstate commerce" mean anything, or is it a

8

jurisdictional fiction?

9

Does the term,

This Court's precedents require that the phrase,

10

"affects interstate commerce," which has been referred to

11

and is used as a part of the RICO statute, require that

12

there be a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

13

Government effectively urges upon this Court a standard of

14

identifiable and perceptible.

15

activity, whether it be a pizza parlor or the buying of

16

tissue paper, that activity is identifiable, it has a

17

potential effect on interstate commerce, and under the

18

Government's theory would be cognizable under the RICO

statute.

QUESTION:

doesn't go anywhere doesn't affect interstate commerce,

9

and if it turns into McDonald's, it does.

10

MR. WARREN:

Well, under the Government's

theory, I believe that the lemonade stand would affect

interstate commerce, because any activity has some effect

on interstate commerce.

4

believe that there is a significant difference, and that

5

Congress was aware of that difference when it passed both

of those statutes, since they were both parts of the

11

that if certain requirements are met, a certain number of

interstate commerce, so I believe that in passing the

14

Organized Crime Control Act Congress was well aware of the

different approaches it could take to interstate commerce.

mines that it wished to regulate, then the individual

2

mines within that class could be aggregated to establish a

3

substantial effect on interstate commerce, but when

4

Congress uses the generic term,

5

virtually every activity within the United States, it's a

6

class that is so broad that it is tantamount to trying to

7

exercise the commerce power itself over every activity.
The rationale, I would submit, of the class

8

9

"enterprise," which covers

analysis, is that classes are subsets of the whole, and

10

that Congress can properly pick out particular classes and

regulate those classes.

QUESTION:

That's a different argument.

I mean,

you're now making a textual argument, and I understood you
before to be saying that if Congress wants to legislate to

10

its limit, it must do so as a constitutional matter, I

11

suppose, by identifying each so-called subclass which it

12

wishes to regulate to the extent of its power, and I

didn't understand that to be an argument based on the text

of this statute.

to interpret that aggregation as having the substantial

MR. WARREN:

Well, gold mines are not defined

either by Congress in the statute or in the legislative

history.

Unlike the Russell case, for example, where the

10

then able to interpret the class of activities as being

MR. WARREN:

I disagree with the position of the

Government that the words,

have a general meaning which we can look at and take into

every statute.

8

in different ways, and that we have to take a close look

9

at the way the words are used in a particular statute, and

I believe that those words have been used

10

it's my position that those words reflect an intent that

11

only substantial effects on interstate commerce be

12

cognizable under the RICO statute.

To what extent do you rely on the

MR. WARREN:

I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg.

I do not rely on the Ninth Circuit to that extent, because

I think that almost any activity in the United States or

20

in any given State draws supplies and purchases supplies

21

from another State, whether we're talking about Alaska, or

22

California, or New York, or Wyoming, so I do not rely on

Mr. Warren, in connection with

distinction that cuts against you. There was a whole line

of cases about people who go up to Alaska to work and then

of employees coming from one State to another.

21

I would point out that in this case there were a

22

total of only five or six employees who worked at this

employees did travel in interstate commerce, it was --as

In fact, I would almost refer to some of these

3

incidents such as the travel of employees, the driving of

4

a Cadillac, which the Government refers to, as incidental

effects, a term which this Court used in Oregon State

crime, and I understand it's been given broader

construction than perhaps Congress intended, but looking

16

at the heart of the statute and wanting to police

investments of this kind of money, why would Congress want

to do anything less than its full power to reach all of

Well, even if it were the more

to your question, Justice Stevens, but there may be

certain types of activities that Congress wants to reach,

MR. WARREN:

I would agree with that.

I would again refer the Court to the Sherman

11

Act, because even though the language of the Sherman Act

12

does not talk about affecting interstate commerce, I

13

believe it provides a useful analog to an analysis.

all other counts that he was convicted on would not be

7

The Government acknowledges in principle that

8

the Commerce Clause has limits.

Its approach, however, is

9

to abandon what I would submit is the longstanding

substantial effect test of this Court, and would give

11

Congress an unbridled power to punish any kind of criminal
