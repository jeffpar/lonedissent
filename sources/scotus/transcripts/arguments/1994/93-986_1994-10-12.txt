ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. GOLDBERGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDBERGER:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the First

12

Amendment permits the State of Ohio to criminalize

13

petitioner's anonymous leafleting in public places because

14

they're unsigned leaflets, urge members of her community

15

to vote against a tax increase in a local referendum.

16

QUESTION:

You're not saying that that's why the

17

leaflets were made punishable, because they urge somebody

18

to vote a particular way.

1

MR. GOLDBERGER:

It seems to me, Your Honor,

20

that it's the contention of the State of Ohio that

21

anonymous political leaflets are unprotected when the

22

leaflets address voters, so indeed it was a combination of

23

the anonymity and the fact that the leaflets were

24

addressed to voters in a coming election.

25

QUESTION:

Because -- you say that's the only

place where the Ohio statute applies, is when the leaflets

2

are addressed to voters?
MR. GOLDBERGER:

3

According to the -- it's when

4

they -- they address voters on a referendum issue, or on

5

an election, if that's the thrust of the Court's question.

6

These are not -- it's not an anonymous --a flat

7

prohibition on all anonymous leafleting, it's a flat

8

prohibition on all anonymous election-related leafleting,
and in specific, the holding of the court below addressed

10

the portion of the statute which prohibited anonymous

11

leafleting with respect to referenda.
The events leading to this case began on

April 27th and 28th of 1 88.

18

it cost more than $250 to produce, there would have been

certain Federal requirements, would there not, of

20

MR. GOLDBERGER:

21

;

that kind of a requirement is valid?
Amendment violation?
MR. GOLDBERGER:

3

No.

I believe, Your Honor,

4

that a disclosure requirement on any leaflet, when the

5

leaflet is constitutes core political speech or is pure

6

speech, would violate the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

There's no First

Well, that wasn't my question.

I

8

don't think the Federal statute requires the disclosure on

9

the leaflet.

10

MR. GOLDBERGER:

11

QUESTION:

I believe it --

I think it requires furnishing

12

information to the FEC that I have spent X amount of

13

dollars in connection with a political campaign, and that
identity is then a matter of record.

I suppose the public

can learn who has made expenditures.

No, we do not, Your Honor, but

21

I -- with all due respect, I do believe 441(d) includes a

requirement that the name appear on the face of the

QUESTION:

What about a requirement on a

3

television ad that the identity of the people running the

4

ad be shown?

5

MR. GOLDBERGER:

I believe that's a different

6

kind of a case, Your Honor, because television is a

7

conduit for a great variety of communication, and there's

8

a potential for confusion when a viewer is watching

9

television as to who's saying what and under what

10

11

circumstances.
In addition, television as a form of

12

broadcasting is governed by the Federal Communications

13

Act, and I believe is subject to a separate and distinct

14

set of rules.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

So that we do have an interest in

knowing who is the speaker?
MR. GOLDBERGER:

You do have an interest in

18

knowing a situation in which there may be confusion,

19

because the speaker appears to be someone other than whom

20

the speaker actually is, but that --

21

QUESTION:

Well, suppose Mrs. McIntyre had hired

22

other people to put out the leaflets, might there not have

23

been confusion there?

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Honor, because the leaflets are -- they speak for

themselves.
When you watch television, you are hearing

2

3

communications from a whole --a large number of people as

4

you're viewing the television screen, and in lots of

5

situations, if you watch Saturday Night Live, for example,

6

there's a lot of confusion as to whether you're watching

7

an advertisement or whether you're watching a comedy skit.

8

(Laughter.)

9

QUESTION:

But your typical TV ad isn't that

10

way.

I mean, there's no doubt for that 30 seconds you're

11

watching a commercial add for Joe Doe.
MR. GOLDBERGER:

12

Well, it seems to me, Your

13

Honor, under those circumstances, if there's clarity as to

14

who the vehicle is, I believe that there's -- there

15

shouldn't be an absolute necessity to place it on the

16

screen.

17

I do believe there's likely to be confusion under those

18

circumstances.

advertisements which substantially exceed the cost of the

campaign expenditure disclosure minimums.

But I would respectfully differ with the Court.

Moreover, you're dealing with political

1

confusion as to who is speaking, in light of the fact that

2

you have the television serving as the conduit, that is

3

arguably constitutionally protected.

4

QUESTION:

Well, if the State showed that there

5

were confusion as to who were handing out leaflets, would

6

there then be a requirement of anon -- of named persons?

7

MR. GOLDBERGER:

It seems to me if you had a

8

statute -- well, you have statutes which deal with

9

election fraud and misrepresentation.

10
11

We're not really

challenging those statutes here.
QUESTION:

Well, I'm positing an assumption

12

where there are a lot of leaflets going around and

13

somebody's confused about who's writing the leaflets.

14
15
16

MR. GOLDBERGER:

I don't believe that's the

business of the State, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well then, that's not the answer to

17

the question between, asking you to distinguish between

18

television and pamphlets.

19

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Well, that assumes that

20

television is governed by the same set of ground rules

21

that are applicable to pamphlets.

22

the Federal Communications Act and the Red Lion decision,

23

this Court has decided that there are separate sets of

24

ground rules that are applicable.

1

with this issue?

2

the distinction.

I mean, that's the basic rationale for

MR. GOLDBERGER:

3

Well, Red Lion is not only a

4

spectrum scarcity case, Your Honor, it's also a case which

5

deals with the problem of having a conduit of

6

communication going into the home which - - there is an

7

immediate impact in which there is a potential for

8

confusion.
QUESTION:

9

Well, isn't there an equal potential

10

for confusion when I walk up to the polling place and I'm

11

handed 6 or 8 or 10 or 12 leaflets saying, vote for this,

12

that, or the other person or issue on the way up to vote?

voters are capable of deciding for themselves.

Let's be concrete about the Ohio

20

statute.

1

believe broadcasting poses a separate question.
QUESTION:

2

3

That's all it applies to, is radio

and television advertising.

4

MR. GOLDBERGER:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So you can, in any and all radio and

6

television ads, the State legitimately can require

7

identification of the speaker?
MR. GOLDBERGER:

8

9

I believe that -- I believe

that's true, but I think it's important to keep in mind

10

that these are not political ads.

The difference between

11

a commercial ad, or a political advertisement on a

12

television, is that it is paid for -- paid for in sums

13

that exceeds the expenditure disclosure minimums, and

14

there is a very different kind of a State interest

15

involved when large sums of money are involved in the

16

election process.

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. --

18

QUESTION:

Well, then, if Ohio had a ceiling on

19

the amount of money that -- it said, Ms. McIntyre can do

20

her flier as long as she's not spending over $500 on it,

21

that would be okay?
MR. GOLDBERGER:

flier?

In a broadcast, or just on the

No, I don't -QUESTION:

You said the thing was the spending

of money, substantial amounts of money.

Suppose this very

1

same statute, but it has a dollar limit under which you

2

don't have to disclose your name.
MR. GOLDBERGER:

3

That would track 441(d), Your

4

Honor.

As we read 441(d), I believe that the appropriate

5

disclosure is not on the face of the leaflet, but it is to

6

the appropriate election commission.

7

this Court has taken the position that expenditure

8

disclosure requirements are appropriate under some

9

circumstances, I think it's a judgment call for the court

However, because

10

as to whether or not it would also require disclosure on

11

the face of the leaflet.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GOLDBERGER:

14

Well, Mr. Goldberger -I believe that should be

unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

15

-- the statute 441(d) does say that

16

whenever a person makes an expenditure for the purpose of

17

financing communications for an election, such

18

communication shall clearly state the name of the person

19

making it.

20

if we have upheld that statute generally in Buckley, where

21

does that leave you?

Now, if that -- if it means what it says, and

MR. GOLDBERGER:

22

Your Honor, 441(d) addresses

23

the question of expenditures.

This is a question of pure

24

speech.

25

addresses the question of expenditures.

This is not a disclosure requirement which

Ohio's laws say,

1

all persons shall put their names on their leaflets.

does not frame it in terms of people who will make

3

expenditures, and --

QUESTION:

But this is less restrictive than an

expenditure statute.

expenses, and (b) a disclosure.

Are you saying that the State can do

the greater and not the lesser.
MR. GOLDBERGER:

No, I -- I'm not sure I

understand the Court's question.
QUESTION:

Well, you're saying that you would

14

assume -- I interpreted this from your answer -- that if

15

there were an expenditure limitation, that a disclosure

16

requirement might be valid.

17

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Well, a disclosure requirement,

18

I believe a disclosure requirement to the election

19

commission would be appropriate.

20

disclosure requirement ought to be required on the face of

21

the leaflet when the leaflet is pure speech and is

22

completely protected.

QUESTION:

I don't believe such a

Do you think it's constitutional to

MR. GOLDBERGER:

1

No, I believe that's not so.

I

2

believe that it is appropriate, or consistent with this

3

Court's decision in Buckley, however, that when someone

4

expends a certain amount of money in excess of a threshold

5

minimum, that they can be compelled to disclose the

6

expenditure to the election commission.

7

QUESTION:

So the constitutionality of such a

8

prohibition would depend on some minimum to be selected by

9

the legislature?

10

MR. GOLDBERGER:

11

QUESTION:

12

No --

Could the legislature suggest 25 --

choose $25?

13

MR. GOLDBERGER:

I believe, Your Honor, that the

14

minimum has constitutional -- has a constitutional element

15

to the extent that it is a minimum which interferes with

16

the ability of street corner leafleters to disseminate

17

their views and to articulate their views, and for others

18

that have a legitimate basis for remaining anonymous

19

because of their fear of retaliation, the kind of

20

retaliation which the justice below suggested might have

21

existed in this case, that there is anonymity and that any

22

threshold requirement has to leave room for that

23

anonymity.

The State's central arguments that -- the
Ohio -- I beg your pardon.

The Ohio supreme court rested

1

its decision on the fact that this case and this statute

2

should be reviewed by a relaxed level of scrutiny.

3

It took the position that because 3599.09 is an

4

election regulation, it is not -- it not need be reviewed

5

by the usual high level of scrutiny that this Court

6

applies to First Amendment communications, and those

7

communications that ordinarily occur in the election

8

context.

9

It rejected Talley, in short, on grounds that

10

petitioner's leaflets addressed voters on discrimination,

11

while Talley addressed passers-by.

12

rejected petitioner's leaflets because it addressed voters

13

in a referendum, while Talley addressed passers-by on the

14

issue of race discrimination.

15

Excuse me.

The Ohio supreme court was wrong.

It

3599.09 is

16

invalid because it is not a regulation of the mechanics of

17

the election process, it is a regulation of pure speech.

18

It interferes with the flow of speech to inform voters, it

19

deters criticisms of public -- it deters criticisms of

20

public officials by those individuals who would prefer to

21

remain anonymous because of a fear of potential

22

retaliation.

McIntyre and corporations?

3

Are you drawing a line between individuals like

MR. GOLDBERGER:

I believe that the Court should

4

draw a line between individuals like McIntyre and

5

corporations.

QUESTION:

What about rich individuals versus

poor corporations?

8

MR. GOLDBERGER:

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. GOLDBERGER:

It seems to me --

It seems to me, Your Honor,

11

that those matters can be handled through expenditure

12

disclosure requirements.

13

Buckley, and to the extent the Court treats them as valid

14

requirements under the First Amendment, the rich speaker

15

can be reached under the First amendment, and I might add,

16

the State of Arizona has used precisely this approach.

This Court has sustained them in

17

It has repealed a statute much like 3599.09, and

18

replaced it with an expenditure disclosure requirement and

19

a disclosure requirement on the face of leaflets which is

20

limited to political committees, and requires only the

21

disclosure of the names of major donors to those political

22

committees where the donor has contributed a very

23

substantial sum of money.

24
25

As a consequence, and the sections, the relevant
sections are cited in footnote 2 of the State's brief -16

QUESTION:

1

Under the Arizona statute, do you

2

have to disclose the names of major donors on the leaflet

3

itself?
MR. GOLDBERGER:

4

As I read the new statute, Your

5

Honor, you disclose the name of one donor, the major

6

donor, one or two donors who have contributed a

7

substantial sum of money on the leaflet.

8

that that's a valid requirement.

9

that the State of Arizona has taken a step back from the

I'm not arguing

MR. SUTTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think the Court's dialogue with Mr. Goldberger

12

demonstrates just how much this case is controlled by

14

Bellotti and Buckley.

15

In Bellotti, we have footnote 32, which

16

specifically states, in the heart of a case in which

17

campaign contributions, or a limitation on campaign

18

contributions was struck down, that the effective vehicle

19

in these instances is a disclosure statute, one where the

20

advertiser, the person circulating the handbill or making

21

the television advertisement, discloses his or her

22

identity.

There's no distinction between those
circumstances and these.

MR. SUTTER:

Well, Your Honor, in Bellotti the

Court decided that there was no distinction, especially in

17

the context of ballot measure elections, between

18

corporations and individuals, that their First Amendment

19

rights were coextensive, so I don't understand how there

20

could be a principled basis upon which one could require a

corporation to disclose just because they were better

3

MR. SUTTER:

No, Your Honor, because the only

4

concern before the Court in Buckley was not just campaign

5

contributions and expenditures, some sort of threshold to

6

distinguish big money from small money, the Court

7

specifically recognized, as a distinct and independent

8

compelling interest, the disclosure of information that

9

was important to the electorate to help them evaluate

10

11

candidates.
In this case -- and in that instance, it was the

16

provides the name of that person as information to the

speech that could have been utilized to deter campaign

In Burson, the Court recognized in Tennessee

that there were voter intimidation laws on the books that

conduct that the Court was trying to deter in Burson, but

that the State had a compelling interest in requiring the

speakers to place their name on the literature.

7

We think that the protections of

There would be no difference, and that is our

8

point here.

There is no principled way to distinguish

9

different types of campaign literature, distinguishing the

10

well heeled,

or those who are capable of communicating

11

more effectively, with those who do so on a smaller level.

12

This Court has recognized that there's really --

13

there's no justification for treating or restricting the

14

rights of groups,

15

individuals.

16

recognized that there are First Amendment rights

17

associated with groups being able to go over and - - go out

One of the points that came up during the course

We think that that's a question, when the facts

appropriately, that they will give it the appropriate

There is no evidence of fear.

circulated indeed contained her name and address, that she

MR. SUTTER:

I think the Court -- I can't stand

3

here and argue to the Court that there aren't prospects or

4

possibilities for deterrence of speech, for chilling of

5

speech, but that was exactly the circumstances in Buckley.
The Court recognized that the campaign finance

6

7

disclosure requirements could chill speech, but the Court

8

hesitated in striking down the statute on the prospect,

9

the speculation of potential harm, and instead decided

10

that on a case-by-case basis, where there would be an

11

opportunity to demonstrate harm, that that would render

12

the statute not applicable to those particular

13

circumstances, and all we are asking is for the same sort

14

of discretion to be extended to the State courts.

15

We think there's very little difference between

16

the Buckley circumstances.

course of this argument some of the dangers to existing

I think there is a tradition.

7

think the aspect of anonymity changes the perspective of

8

the case.

We're not saying, and didn't say to Margaret

McIntyre, that she couldn't speak, that she couldn't hand
10

out literature, that she couldn't say whatever she wanted

11

in that literature.

12

All we're saying is, because of the

13

countervailing State interest in protecting the electoral

14

process, that we may -- that the State may require her to

15

provide the public with access to a limited amount of

16

pertinent information to help them make better educated

electoral choices, and I think that under the

circumstances where you have these competing interests,

posit?

briefs here, in which that kind of double fraud has been

2

perpetrated, and therefore has rendered the State's

3

interest one of hope, rather than of realistic

4

expectation.
MR. SUTTER:

5

There's nothing in this record to

6

demonstrate that.

I suppose it could happen, but I don't

7

think that would be sufficient to invalidate the scope of

8

the law.

The State can't regulate under those

circumstances, if they're going to be concerned about who
10

will try to evade it.
And this statute here -- another similarity that

11
12

I'd like to point out with the Buckley case is that in

13

Buckley the Court struck down limitations on expenditures,

14

identifying that as intruding on core political speech,

15

but it retained -- it validated the disclosure

16

requirement, and that's the same sort of statute that we

17

have here.

18

If one looks at Buckley and Bellotti, especially

1

at the Bellotti footnote, that authorizes this kind of

20

attribution, it links Buckley and Bellotti.

21

Buckley for the same proposition that the State is citing

22

it for today, and that has two important characteristics.

23

One is that Buckley addressed not just groups but

24

individuals, and it links them in a way that they are both

disclosure statutes, that they are both constitutional.

The second is that, well it will help us enforce

expenditures in some way or other.

MR. SUTTER:

I'll start backwards, if I may.

7

First, I think the Court has articulated the interest that

8

was recognized in Buckley that there was an independent

9

justification for upholding the disclosure laws, and that

10

was to provide information to the electorate, important

11

information to help them evaluate the candidates.
And I think it's striking in the context of

12

13

Buckley that the Court not only required disclosure of

14

identity, but disclosure of associations, a much more

15

severe restriction and disclosure requirement than just

16

placing your own name and address on your literature, so

17

we think that this regulation is even less demanding and

18

less intrusive of First Amendment rights.

types of campaign reform was underway, as the Court noted

in Burson, with the Australian ballot procedure, and these

MR. SUTTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Some statutes in

10

the predecessor to the Ohio statute, as early as 1 22, but

11

the statute was in existence for years before that, and

12

that's, I think, a good point, is that this is all part of

13

the same reform movement in electoral politics.

The Court recognized in Buckley that the

disclosure requirement was part of Congress' effort at

total disclosure.

8

important legislation.
They think that it outweighs any interest in

10

anonymity because it doesn't affect the person's right to

11

speak, and I think, Your Honor, Justice O'Connor, that

12

here the State perhaps could have decided not to do this,

13

but that doesn't minimize the interest.

14

The State still had the interest in providing

15

this sort of limited information to help voters evaluate

16

ballot issues.

17

ballot issues affect the electorate's life as much as

18

legislative decisions by the legislature.

There's really no difference.

Thank you.

QUESTION:

21

That's why.

Why?

I mean,

That was my

question before, and I wrote down the answer -- Buckley.

22

MR. SUTTER:

23

QUESTION:

Buckley.
Yes, I got that answer.

I want to

24

know if there's anything more than that.

25

if you have the voters of the State of Ohio who say, we

That is to say,

1

really would like to know who is putting this out, and you

2

have a person who says, I really don't want to tell you.
All right, now, why is it that the Constitution

3
4

comes down on the side of the voters of Ohio, given the

5

First Amendment?
MR. SUTTER:

6

Your Honor, the First Amendment

7

protects speech, but it doesn't necessarily say that the

8

State can never regulate anonymous speech.
QUESTION:

9

So in other words, if the person --

10

you could have a law which says, if, by the way, you put

11

an argument in an election campaign, you must legally put

12

the counterargument.

13

mean, is that con --he says, I don't want to tell you the

14

arguments against my position -MR. SUTTER:

15
16

Your Honor, I think that's the

Tornillo case.

17
18

That might be a very nice law, but I

QUESTION:

I just want to tell you the ones for

it.
MR. SUTTER:

19

I think that's the Tornillo case,

-

20

but these statutes, that sort of scenario is drastically

21

different.

22

We're not trying to make someone say, "I have my position,

23

and now I'm going to articulate my opponent's."

24

asking for is that you identify yourself and then say

25

whatever you want.

We're not trying to control the content.

QUESTION:

It was not -- it was not that she
it was her failure to disclose

That's true of most of the cases that

we get here.
(Laughter.)
MR. SUTTER:

Your Honor, but it does go to this

10

whole question of retaliation, and it goes to this whole

11

question of what the real intrusion was as far as First

12

Amendment speech is concerned.

Thank you.
