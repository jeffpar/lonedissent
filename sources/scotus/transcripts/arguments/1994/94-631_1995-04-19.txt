ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID F. WALBERT

10

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE APPELLANTS

11
12

13

MR. WALBERT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
We are in this courtroom today almost exactly

14

one half century after the decision by this Court in

15

Colgrove v. Green.

16

important to us today just to remember what Justice

17

Frankfurter said there as he warned against a foray into

18

the political thicket.

I think that case is particularly

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WALBERT:

Wasn't that overruled later?
That was -- for the last 30 years,

21

Your Honor, this Court has navigated that political

22

thicket through Baker v. Carr and Reynolds, but I would

23

suggest to this Court that we're at a fork in the road

24

where instead of going through a manageable political

25

thicket where one person, one vote decisions are made

based on mathematics, we are standing at the edge of a

2

precipice where if Shaw is applied like the district court

3

did here, the standards of open-ended review of why the

4

legislature did this, why they did that, the goodness or

5

the badness and the reasonableness of the particular

6

reapportionment decisions, we would respectfully submit on

7

behalf of the State of Georgia that we have a whole new

8

kind and character of political thicket, not like what

9

this Court has ever gone through before.
QUESTION:

10
11

here?

Is there an issue about the "why"

I thought in this case --

12

MR. WALBERT:

13

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

-- as in the other one, there's no

14

doubt that the object was to create a majority minority

15

district.

16

MR. WALBERT:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. WALBERT:

19
20

The difference --

Is that contested?
That there was a purpose and a

goal of drawing a majority minority -QUESTION:

If you'd like to say purpose or goal

21

instead of object, that's okay with me, but that was

22

indeed the purpose or goal, to create a majority

23

minority --

24
25

MR. WALBERT:

The only difference that we have

on this, Your Honor, is whether that was the predominant

1

objective.

There was indeed a purpose to draw that goal,

2

but we have -- I think I could not state the argument

3

better than Justice Breyer asked the question.

4

meaningless in these cases to have a district court try

5

and determine what the predominant, substantial,

6

significant type of decision is on how the lines are

7

drawn.

8

was a consensus politically before the Department of

9

Justice ever got involved in the State of Georgia to try

It is

There was a purpose always in this case.

There

10

and draw a majority minority district in East Central

11

Georgia, no question about that fact.
QUESTION:

12

13

There certainly wasn't a consensus to

draw a third one.

14

MR. WALBERT:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WALBERT:

17
18

That is correct, Your Honor.

Yes.
As a matter of fact, that is

correct.
In terms of the second one, the Eleventh

19

District that is at issue here, the one that the findings

20

of the district court are made upon and the one that the

21

judgment of the district court in this case are involved

22

with, the Eleventh, however, in that location generally,

23

East Central Georgia, there was indeed a consensus

24

politically to have a district of this general location.

Well, Mr. Walbert, following Brown v.

1

Board of Education there were a number of challenges to

2

school districting in the north where there had never been

3

segregation by law, and those challenges were based on the

4

idea that the school district, the school boards drew

5

racially sensitive district lines tending to keep blacks

6

in one district, and those kind of inquiries were exactly

7

the same sort of inquiry here, what was the predominant

8

purpose of the school board, and apparently those matters

9

were dealt with without any great difficulty.

10

MR. WALBERT:

I would have to beg to differ with

11

Your Honor's characterization of the relative complexity

12

of the two kinds of cases.

This Court and the evidence in

3

this case, this Court has said any number of times, and

4

the evidence is undisputed if on one point in this case

5

that reapportionment is the most complex, politically

6

complex matter that ever comes before a General Assembly.

7

QUESTION:

Well, I think if you asked a school

8

board what was the most complex matter came before it that

9

the school board would probably say redistricting --

20

MR. WALBERT:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. WALBERT:

Well --

Drawing attendance zones.
Your Honor, I think that the

23

relative complexity of that and the hundreds of issues of

24

the 236 members of the General Assembly of the State of

25

Georgia, the two would pale by comparison.

I think that

1

is the evidence in this case.

2

QUESTION:

I don't

So you say that although the motive

3

inquiry was handled apparently without any undue

4

difficulty in the claims of de facto segregation, the

5

similar motive inquiry can't be handled in a case like

6

this?

7

MR. WALBERT:

It is unquestionably at least a

8

whole order of magnitude much more sophisticated and much

9

more complicated on the first hand.
On the other hand, we're talking about politics.

10
11

We're talking about that very thing that should never be

12

in the courts when it doesn't absolutely have to be,

3

attendance line drawing and the judgments of the district

4

courts about the whys, the wherefores, and the wisdom of

5

attendance line drawing is something that courts should,

6

and maybe could, manage.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. WALBERT:

9

they can.

Well, that's what this Court held

I'm talking about the relative ability -QUESTION:

20

Well, why should they manage that?

I don't think the Court -- this is a

21

little bit -- I don't think the Court held that.

ahead.

MR. WALBERT:

In terms of politics, Your Honor,

24

the critical distinction between this case and what Your

25

Honor raises is this.

The wall of separation of our

function of Government that this Court has talked about

2

for 100 years is what we're talking about crossing now

3

when we get into the wisdoms, the whys, and the wherefores

4

of reapportionment decisions.
If we're going to make the kind of open-ended

5
6

review of reapportionment decisions that was made by this

7

district court in this case, the wisdom of whether

8

Savannah should be coastal or whether it should be part of

9

this district -QUESTION:

10

You're saying if Georgia should

11

deliberately draw a district in order to prevent blacks

12

from electing a representative, there would be nothing we

13

could do about that?

14
15

MR. WALBERT:

Smith case this Court affirmed which we stand behind.

QUESTION:

MR. WALBERT:

The Court did something about

that.
QUESTION:
us we can't.

But no --

MR. WALBERT:

We cannot --

about it.

20

Well, I think that's the Busbee v.

Indeed we did, but you're now telling

Isn't it the same problem?

MR. WALBERT:

No, I don't believe so, Your

Honor.

1

QUESTION:

Why not?

2

MR. WALBERT:

Those courts -- first of all,

3

those cases had the prerequisite that helps you get away

4

from the political complexities of harm.

5

There is no harm proved here.

6

There's no claim and no evidence of any sort --

7

QUESTION:

Harm was proved.

There is no vote dilution.

This is harm proven.

The harm proven

8

is that someone who said he would be in this district has

9

been excluded from it because of his race.

10

QUESTION:

You're arguing Shaw v. Reno now.

11

MR. WALBERT:

No, I don't think so, Your Honor.

12

In the Busbee case we're talking about whether there was

13

an actual effort and an ability to keep blacks out of

14

office, but that --

15

QUESTION:

I don't see how it's any more

16

difficult to figure out whether the legislature drew its

17

lines to put blacks in or to keep blacks out.

18

question is the same as the other question, and the notion

19

that one is impossible for us to determine but the other

20

is not, I don't understand the reason for that.

21

MR. WALBERT:

The one

I would respectfully -- there's no

22

question again, Justice Scalia, that there is an element

23

of -- and the purpose, there was a purpose, a goal to draw

24

a majority minority district here.

2

you can parse it down and talk about 100 legislators.

This line, once you have the overall objective -- let's,

overall purpose was in fact to create a majority minority

13

district?

14

there's an answer to that.

15

there is such a thing as an answer to that question.

16

I don't know.

I'm not sure intellectually

those decisions, would be drawn in just like it is.

about how it would be better to have Savannah being part

The

that.

what is good or bad about reapportionment, and the thing

11

Suppose you're the Attorney General

12

of the United States, do you have a constitutional

13

obligation to refrain from telling the State, do

14

everything you can to create majority minority districts

15

to the maximum amount possible?

16

MR. WALBERT:

We don't think what Your Honor

17

just stated is part of section 5 or section 2, so I

18

guess --

19

QUESTION:

I'm asking whether or not it's

20

consistent with the Constitution of the United States and

21

the Equal Protection Clause for the Attorney General of

22

the United States to direct a State to proceed as I've

23

indicated.

Why?

Why?

Why wouldn't --

The statutes don't require that.

Pardon me?
Neither section 2 nor section 5

require it.
QUESTION:

Suppose the statute did permit the

Attorney General to do that, would there be a
constitutional violation?
MR. WALBERT:

I think it would very much depend

12

on the particular facts of the particular case.

Maximization --

QUESTION:

The facts of the case are

MR. WALBERT:

If it was nothing but

17

maximization, without regard to any other considerations,

18

that would be unconstitutional.

19

Why?

20

MR. WALBERT:

Because that at some point would

get -- it would violate Shaw.

MR. WALBERT:

1

We're saying this, Your Honor, and

2

nothing more than this.

3

and to reach that question about what is permissible and

4

what is not permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, we

5

respectfully urge this Court as most strenuously as we can

6

to try and draw an objective set of standards to implement

the Shaw case rather than this generalized subjective

intent thing, rather than a generalized review of the

goodness or the badness of the redistricting decisions of

objective as a criteria than discriminatory purpose?

don't see that it is.

MR. WALBERT:

I

I think they're both objective.
Your Honor, we would certainly

15

urge the Court to stay away from shape as a talisman where

16

it's the eye of the beholder type of shape, does it look

17

good, does it look bad.

18

What we think and what we urge the Court is,

19

where the district line is predominantly composed and

20

based upon the kind of county boundary, State boundary,

21

city boundaries, and the precinct lines then is the last

22

remaining part, that are locally determined based on

geographical markers, major highways, roads, and so on,

the line should be drawn, and that's where we say it's the

most appropriate way because that will not draw the courts

2

into the political thicket any deeper than they otherwise

3

have to be.

4

QUESTION:

Well, what if the lines in fact are

5

conveniently drawn precisely as you say.

They follow

6

various political boundaries, and a plaintiff who is a

7

member of the district in question comes in and says, yes,

8

they were lucky, they had these boundaries, but in fact

9

the only motivation behind the drawing of these lines was

10

simply to find a set of lines that would give a majority

11

minority district when there in fact is no justification

12

for it.

13

Is that person out of court?
MR. WALBERT:

That person's out of court, Your

14

Honor, and I think as a matter of law when you're

15

following the existing lines that have been drawn for

16

other purposes, that is by --

No, not in any way, shape, or

predominant purpose, and in fact the result and the intent

was racial packing.

If he's out of court, then at least one category

2

of traditional dilution jurisprudence is overruled.
MR. WALBERT:

I think not, Your Honor.

I would

respectfully suggest this is the reason why.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DREW S. DAYS, III

10

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL APPELLANT
GENERAL DAYS:

11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I want to address first the issue that members

13
14

of the Court have raised on several occasions in both the

15

prior argument and this argument, and that is the

16

predominant or motivating factor.
Our position is that that is not the proper

17
18

analysis.

The proper analysis under Shaw or under this

19

Court's prior precedents is whether the State is doing

20

something for blacks that it would not do for others.

21

That is, where blacks are being treated differently, given

22

different treatment, arguably to assist blacks, that it

23

would not provide for other groups.

or of some other evidence, that is sufficient to move the

But in our estimation, that has to be the

3

threshold analysis.

4

that have come from the bench today.

5

State is drawing districts that it would draw for Polish

6

Americans, or for Scottish Irish in Louisiana, or for

7

other groups, then our position is that does not trigger

strict scrutiny.

QUESTION:

It picks up many of the questions
That is, if the

But are you stipu -- are you assuming

10

that Irish descent, Polish descent is subject to strict

11

scrutiny the same way that race is?

12

GENERAL DAYS:

No, I'm not arguing that it is

13

subject to strict scrutiny, but the point I'm making is

14

that if the State were not to treat blacks who have a

15

community of interest, and that can be established in the

16

record, as it would treat other groups, then blacks are

17

being denied the equal protection of the laws, because the

18

only reason they're being denied the treatment that others

19

receive is because of the color of their skins.

20

QUESTION:

Well, that just repudiates, though,

21

our equal protection jurisprudence.

22

race is subjected to a much more demanding standard of

23

inquiry than something else.

1

for example, what the district court found was that there

2

was evidence that was partially convincing of the fact

3

that there was a community of interest among African

4

Americans within the Eleventh District, but what the Court

5

said is as follows, and this is at 44a of the

6

jurisdictional statement appendix:

7

It says,

"The problem with this tack is that,

8

while partially convincing, such a community of interest

9

is barred from constitutional recognition."

That cannot

10

be correct under the Constitution.

11

that blacks who share political interest, social interest,

12

economic interest, a history of discrimination against

13

them based upon their race, cannot be recognized as a

14

community that has a right to representation in the halls

15

of Congress.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

3

But wasn't there also evidence that

community of interest or no community of interest, the

only reason this was done was that the Justice Department

was demanding a third district, time was growing short,

didn't have time, or the State didn't, in the District of

in effect was to say, we surrender to the Justice

not look at the extent to which the district that was

drawn was consistent with principles that Georgia had

applied in a variety of other circumstances.
QUESTION:

10

All right, wasn't the evidence

equally clear that Georgia was in fact not applying them

here, that Georgia had no intention to apply them to

fact, which the dissent brings out very clearly, that what

Georgia was doing was consistent with what it had done in

The relevance is that if one

those letters reflect was that Georgia was doing not only

If maximization means that the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. LEE PARKS

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

MR. PARKS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The plaintiffs in this case ask the Court to

6

affirm the judgment of the district court that the

7

Eleventh Congressional District was an intentional racial

8

gerrymander that is at constitutional odds with the equal

9

protection jurisprudence of this Court.

10

All parties in this case I think would agree

11

with this opening premise:

12

constitutional evil that will be condoned only on a

13

limited basis, and if they're temporary.

14

in love with the assumption that race-based is remedial,

15

and in this case the illness was not defined before the

16

remedy was assumed.

17

race-based remedies are a

We have fallen

The real world of this case is beyond much of

18

what we have talked about here today.

19

this case is simple, and put forward in length in the

20

district court's opinion.

21

The real world of

The State of Georgia was confronted with a

22

regional plan of the Department of Justice that required

23

maximization of black voting strength based upon a

24

heretofore unavailable technology.

25

allowed reapportionment to be done at a census block level

That technology

with such scalpel-like precision that the races could be
separated to achieve particular racial percentages.
Not only within the district, but because of

4

that precision, the Department of Justice made the

5

assumption that the Voting Rights Act requires racial

6

proportionality within the districts.

7

explanation for why Georgia would have been required to

8

rip out the core of two traditionally established

9

districts and to change from what they originally proposed

0

to what ended up as the Georgia districting plan.
QUESTION:

That is the only

Mr. Parks, let me change the facts

2

just a little.

3

anticipating that they were going to have some difficulty

4

in retaining the white vote -- let's say, the Democrats --

5

decided that our loyal constituent, 90-percent voters for

6

the Democratic Party, are blacks, so now that we have this

7

additional district, let's make sure that we have a solid

8

Democratic district, and the Eleventh District was drawn

9

solely to have a solid Democratic district, and to include

20
2

Let's say that the Georgia legislature,

the most loyal Democratic voters.
MR. PARKS:

What's wrong with that?

I think the Court in the first Hays

22

opinion dealt with Your Honor's hypothetical, and the

23

Court made, I think, the appropriate distinction between

24

motive and intent.

25

we want to increase the Democratic strength of a

What is wrong with that?
MR. PARKS:

I think because it employs racial

classifications, whether -- now, the State would come in

14

and say -- at least you would move to direct scrutiny

15

because it employed the racial classification.

MR. PARKS:

So then in your -- sorry.
That -- the direct answer is, that's

20

not going to avoid the traditional strict scrutiny

21

analysis, and if you get into that, I think that the

22

political issue is not going to rise to the level of a

23

compelling State interest that would allow that type of

24

districting to succeed.

QUESTION:

So then, in your view, if people in

the legislature take race, or religion, or nationality

2

into account and put lots of members of one group into a

3

district for a host of political reasons, then the court

4

system, the 700 Federal judges, or whatever, will start to

5

reexamine that.

Is that what your statement is?

MR. PARKS:

6

No, Justice Breyer.

I think that --

I think your hypothetical takes it a step further.

9

consideration, that these black voters were going to be

moved.

MR. PARKS:

And -If we begin to broaden the spectrum

3

of consideration, then I think that it becomes a more

difficult question.

QUESTION:

They do the same thing, but a lot of

MR. PARKS:

Right.

into account in districting.

1

I take it under Shaw v. Reno that sometimes the

2

single factor of race, while it could be taken into

3

account, goes too far.

4

by which you measure going too far?

5

All right.

What's the criterion

Now, I understand the opposite side's criteria.

6

They say, you don't go too far.

You don't even get into

7

this matter unless you have a bizarrely shaped district

8

that differs in significant ways from what used to be in

9

this State, because that bizarrely shaped district is a

10

signal, a signal that the consideration went too far.

11

Now, there could be other kinds of signals.

12

What are the other signals, in your view, because if we

13

could find a signal, then perhaps -- and I could

14

understand an application of Shaw that wouldn't turn

15

everything topsy-turvy, but what are the signals?

16

The Solicitor General says, I'll tell you one,

17

that the shape is so bizarre when considered with the past

18

that that fact, together with the racial motivation,

19

provides a threshold.

20

Now, maybe I don't -- maybe that isn't the right

21

signal, maybe I don't have it right, but I'm trying to get

22

your view on that question.

23

MR. PARKS:

In looking at that question, I went

24

back to the oral argument that was presented to this Court

25

in Shaw v. Reno to see if the Court engaged in any

1

discussion of that.

There is only a single question in

2

response on whether the shape of the district would either

3

be an element or some some threshold test or merely

4

evidence of racial classifications.

5

Justice O'Connor asked the question at page 38

6

of the transcript, I guess you would agree that district

7

12 is a highly irregular shape.

8

districts such as that could be, in and of itself, some

9

evidence of an invidious intent, and the State of North

Do you think that

10

Carolina agreed.

I have always assumed that we would

11

never create some type of a threshold that would be visual

12

in nature that might, in fact, mask more sophisticated --

QUESTION:

Then --

QUESTION:

Then that -- you've

righted my question, and I'm sorry to -- but then, 1)

can understand this possibility, as several of the briefs

have stated and the amicus briefs have stated.

20

went too far.

First, you

Maybe it is visual, to show that it

21

Then, once you go beneath the threshold, you

22

look to see if there's a compelling interest, namely a

remedy for past discrimination, of which there has been

plenty.

Right.

1

All right, and then you look for

tailoring under the five traditional criteria of

that.

5

I'm not saying it's correct.

I understanda

I understand it.

I understand the alternative, which would be to

6

go into every district in half the counties in this State,

7

and what I'm looking for, is there some other way of doing

8

it?

9

MR. PARKS:

Your Honor, the -- there's one

10

additional fact I don't know if Your Honor has included,

11

but when we talk about visual, there are two maps you have

12

to look at.

You cannot just look at the map that shows in

3

macro form the geographical boundaries of the district.

4

No matter how irregular and how elongated their

5

appendages, they might just show that a municipality was

6

on that appendage.

7

QUESTION:

No, but all you're saying -- all

8

you're saying, I think, is that the so-called visual test,

9

the bizarreness test, will not, in fact, smoke out

20

everything that is wrong.

21

MR. PARKS:

22

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And I think General Days was very

23

clear in answering me that that is not his position.

saying that that is a sufficient test to identify a case

25

in which there should be strict scrutiny.

He's

He is also, I think, clearly saying that the

1

2

other tests, those tests, for example, that we have

3

identified for a traditional dilution jurisprudence, are

4

still there, so that in the point that you made that we

5

might, in fact, have a nonbizarre district which

6

nonetheless masked quite invidiously intentional

7

discrimination, they're not saying that you can't look at

8

that.

11

They're simply saying that you have to state a

it might be.
MR. PARKS:

Well, but then maybe, but if we have

12

just this specific claim, voters contending that there has

13

been intentional racial classifications that has resulted

14

in a gerrymandered district, but we're not allowed to look

15

past the visual to juxtapose the race map to see that

16

these lines are drawn --

17

QUESTION:

No, you are allowed to look beyond

18

it, but if you want to look beyond it for purposes other

19

than bringing what I will call a bizarreness Shaw claim,

20

you've got to allege those kinds of harms, for example,

21

i.e., those are your thresholds that are identified with

22

dilution, and there may be other reasons, too, but that

23

would be one reason, and that, it seems to me, would be

24

one answer that you could give to Justice Breyer.

don't think it is the end-all.

2

we have not only the bizarre shape of this district

3

compared to the past districting principles, but we also

4

have facts as found by the district court that this entire

5

districting plan was driven by proportionality, and that

6

proportionality far exceeded the racial and geographic

7

demographics of this State to sustain it.

8

9

QUESTION:

For example, in this case

Well, would you say that if the

legislature is so driven by race that it ignores

10

compactness and contiguity in a way that it would not and

11

has not for any other group, that that would state an

12

equal protection claim?

3

MR. PARKS:

Yes, Your Honor, and I think that is

4

the essence of Shaw v. Reno.

5

trying to give us is an operative way of dealing with

6

these cases.

7

QUESTION:

I think what Shaw v. Reno is

So if there has been a political

8

gerrymander, as occurred in the case we heard just before

9

this one, then you could do a racial district that more or

20

less matches that political gerrymander, right?

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, I don't think so.

QUESTION:

No, but I mean, you're lucky, or

8

you're unlucky, depending on whether you want to use

9

racial districting or not.

If you're lucky enough to come

10

from a State that's been using gerrymanders, you can do

11

it, and if you're unlucky enough to come from a State that

12

hasn't been, as you tell me Georgia is, then you can't do

13

it.

Does that make very much sense?

14

MR. PARKS:

No, it doesn't, Your Honor, because

it then allows racial -- it allows racial gerrymanders to

escape the strict scrutiny that this Court wants to apply,

And we have that in this case.
No, but where does your answer leave

5

you in response to the question, is everything, in fact,

6

going to qualify for attack, because the Shaw bizarreness

criterion says look, there is a point at which the

8

consideration of race may indeed become just outrageous.

MR. PARKS:

10

Right.
We accept the fact that some

considerations of race are necessary.

Some are outrageous.

The traditional dilution jurisprudence says

well, we're not going to depend on bizarreness, and we're

not going to depend on the kind of dilution harms, and

doesn't that leave you as saying, whenever you consider it

for any purpose, which in fact is always, because you

can't district without taking it into consideration

MR. PARKS:

1

The answer that the district court

2

had to that problem, Your Honor, was elevating the

3

standard, and I think it made an intentional elevation

4

from the Arlington Heights standard to a higher standard

5

in recognition that reapportionment is a legislative act

6

where race is frequently taken into consideration.

7

"Predominant and overriding," in the words of

8

our court, created a demonstrably higher standard than I

9

think the one that the justice is concerned about.

I do

10

think that that higher standard was a reasoned choice by

11

the district court that spoke to that issue, and I

12

disagree with the appellants that predominant intent is

13

some unworkable, unmanageable standard that courts can't

14

deal with.

15

QUESTION:

Is there any way to comment on - - and

16

maybe there isn't, but is there any way to comment on the

17

likelihood that the predominance standard is in fact going

18

to raise a series of claims subject to strict scrutiny in

19

greater numbers than the bizarreness threshold would do?

How do we compare those two?

MR. PARKS:

May I ask -Your Honor, that is not far off the

point.

QUESTION:

Yes, I understand.

May I ask you a

5

question about your view of a portion of the district

6

court's holding --

7

MR. PARKS:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, Your Honor.
-- that grows out of Justice Scalia's

suggestion that perhaps community of interest among

10

persons in a group might justify an odd-shaped district,

11

and the district court, as the Solicitor General pointed

12

out, said that the problem with doing that is that such a

3

community of interest is barred from constitutional

4

recognition if it's defined by racial group.

5

that's a correct statement of the law?

MR. PARKS:

Do you think

I think that if you're talking

about, in Your Honor's question, a bizarre shape, yes, I

do, because the only thing that I can --

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume we don't have a

20

bizarre shape, if you just have evidence of predominant

21

motive, and then the response is, yes, we had the

22

predominant motive, but we were trying to justify --we

23

tried to justify it on the grounds of a community of

interest.

to the same church, 90 percent share certain athletic

interests, or other community interests, would that be

permissible justification?
MR. PARKS:

That's the question.

Yes, because -- I think it would,

because race has fallen out of the mix in terms of

predominant characteristic here.

things that have nothing to do with race.

You're talking about

then?

12

would assume, hearkening back to Justice Scalia's question

earlier on, there would be a study or some basis for that,

and that we would then, as plaintiffs, evaluate that and

determine whether this is pretext or whether -- I mean,

race cases in employment law, in contracting law, in

issues, and we don't say that we're going to ignore quotas

at a university, or we're going to ignore quotas on public

might make uncovering the racial animus that drives those

QUESTION:

Can I ask you a question about an

earlier question that Justice Thomas asked about adopting
an odd-shaped district in order to maximize the number of
Democratic voters, or Republican voters, whatever.

You

said it would be bad if you simply crammed a lot of voters
of a certain race into that district in order to maximize
the vote of a party, knowing that that race votes 90
percent one way or the other.
Suppose you didn't do it that way, however.
Suppose you just looked at the voting returns, and without
considering race, drew the same weird-shaped district.

It

would come out the same way.
MR. PARKS:
QUESTION:

You say by precincts?
By precincts, about which precincts

voted Republican, which voted Democratic, and when you
ended up, you had an odd-shaped district that was
60 percent black.
MR. PARKS:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKS:

Right.
Would that be a violation?
No.

No, I don't think so.

No, race did not predominate.

It's similar to drawing our Fifth

Congressional District.

MR. PARKS:

good way to do it, and the further reason I say that is

this.

bought this computer that does this work, and it sat on

the bench at this trial, and this computer can bring that

information up just like that, show you the precinct, show

you the last election, and you can draw that Democratic

MR. PARKS:

Let me read to you what the State of Georgia

17

said 2 weeks before it gave in and threw its towel in,

18

what it said to a Federal district court when faced with a

19

Department of Justice demand that three districts be

20

created.

21

"This plan amounts to nothing more than a complaint that

22

the State should have but has not sought proportional

23

representation for minority citizens as a goal."

24
25

I stand corrected.

This is on page 22, footnote 22 of our brief:

The State went on to lambast the Department of
Justice as asking for not only unprecedented but a

dangerous plan regarding the political proces of this

2

Nation.

3

ultimately passed, would cause racial polarization and

4

encourage candidates of one race to be unresponsive to the

5

needs and wishes of another race, thereby breeding

6

extremism in both races to the detriment of all citizens.

7

A Max Black's plan, which was the proponent and

8

the blueprint for their plan, in the opinion of the State

9

2 weeks before they accepted it,

It then contended that the plan, as it was

"will most certainly have

10

the effect and result of diminishing minority

11

effectiveness in the political process" -- "diminishing

12

minority effectiveness in the political process."

QUESTION:

Mr. Parks --

QUESTION:

But they're here defending it today,

aren't they?
MR. PARKS:

They're here defending it today, but

17

I submit to you that the record is overwhelmingly clear

18

that that is out of expedience rather than any compelling

19

State justification.

20

QUESTION:

I thought your footnote described the

21

complaint in another case, that they were describing, the

22

complaint in Jones -- is this Jones v. Miller?

23

MR. PARKS:

Yes, but the State -- in that case,

24

they sought through section 2 to have these three minority

25

districts drawn.

The State was defending it and filed a

motion to dismiss the case, and those quotes are from the
State's brief opposing the implementation of the plan.
QUESTION:

And they're describing the complaint

in that case.
MR. PARKS:

Yes, but that plan is seeking to

have the Department of Justice mandate made the law
through section 2.
The State of Georgia admits that the Voting
Rights Act could not stand as a compelling State interest
for this plan.

When you remove the Voting Rights Act from

this type of racial gerrymandering, what else is there?
What else could there be?
The State says, a fair shot.

A fair shot is

code for proportionality, because proportionality is all
they argued at the district court.

They read De Grandy as

sanctioning proportionality, and I read -QUESTION:

Why isn't it a compelling -- isn't

it
MR. PARKS:
QUESTION:

-- that opinion very differently.
Couldn't it be a compelling interest

many, many, many yeas the State was set up in such a way
to prevent African Americans from having the same kind of
vote, or even having a vote, as other persons had?

But then would we then use, if we got

past the threshold and then we found such a compelling
