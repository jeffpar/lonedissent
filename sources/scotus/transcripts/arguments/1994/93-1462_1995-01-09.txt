ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES CHING

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CHING:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
There are two modes of analysis which are used

11
12

in determining ex post facto cases.

13

substantial harm or detriment analysis, and second is the

14

Calder/Collins analysis.

15

judgment of the Ninth Circuit in this case should be

16

reversed.

17

The first is the

Under either analysis, the

The history of substantial harm, detriment,

18

however the test is phrased, is relatively recent.

19

see, for instance, in Miller v. Florida, a case in which

20

there is a 9-0 vote, that an increase in the recommended

21

sentencing guides, which results in a recommended sentence

22

which is patently higher than that which the inmate

23

previously faced, would be an ex post facto law.

24
25

We can

We are also aware, because of the concurring
opinion in Collins, of what does not constitute

1

substantial harm.

That is, a procedural rule which does

2

not affect a concededly valid conviction.
Between these two poles is a lot of room, and in

3
4

this room I believe the indication, for instance, in the

5

concurring opinion of Chief Justice Rehnquist in Weaver,

6

that we are talking about a lose form of evaluation, an

7

evaluation of whether, on the bottom line, the inmate has

8

been harmed.

9

In the instant case, the Ninth Circuit made a

10

quick showing of substantial harm by assuming that it

11

existed.

12

because a parole suitability hearing must be had before a

13

parole date may be obtained, it must be that the failure

14

to accord them frequently amounted to substantial harm.

15

We have a statement that logic dictates that

This is clearly fallacious.

Circuit has done - -

17

QUESTION:

What the Ninth

Well, it may or may not be correct in

18

the given.case, but doesn't it have something to recommend

19

it at least as a way of measuring what probably will be

20

the general effect of the statute?

21

MR. CHING:

Well, certainly and, of course,

22

you're correct in pointing out that we are concerned with

23

the general class of prisoners affected.

24
25

QUESTION:

And I take it you also would not say

that there is anything conclusive in the fact that there

will always be a finding that it would be unlikely that if

2

the prisoner came back within 3 years there would be any

3

relief.

4

you out of the general rule.

I take it you don't rest entirely on that to take

MR. CHING:

5

Yes, Your Honor, my contention is

6

that the provision of the annual parole suitability

7

hearing is a necessary condition, but it is not a

8

sufficient condition for any given inmate to obtain a

9

parole date.
QUESTION:

10

Well, but is it always going to be --

11

in your view, is the general rule always going to be

12

displaced by the finding made that in all -- I forget what

13

the term of art is, that probably if the prisoner were to

14

come back within 3 years, he would not get relief by

15

parole?

16

MR. CHING:

Yes, Your Honor, I agree entirely

17

with your supposition.

18

findings made by the parole board that the individual

19

would not receive a parole date in the first and second

20

year subsequent to the initial hearing obviates any

21

possibility that he may successfully claim substantial

22

harm by the - -

So it is conclusive, then.

to say that, yes.

1

QUESTION:

Well, then what we're left with is a

2

general rule in which you concede the probable effect of

3

the general rule over a large class of cases will be to

4

extend the date before which parole is granted, and yet

5

you're saying that in any individual case there will never

6

be a showing of harm because of this particular finding.

7

MR. CHING:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CHING:

Yes.
Is that where we leave it?
Yes.

I believe that it is

10

impossible for an inmate who is affected by this

11

modification to show that he would have received

12

suitability --a successful suitability hearing in the

13

first and second years, those years in which he would not

14

under the amendment statute, and therefore he can never

15

show substantial harm, and neither can any member of the

16

affected class, within reason.

17

QUESTION:

Well, what about in Miller?

Would it

18

have been possible to show that the recommended sentence

19

would necessarily be the sentence?

20

say that getting a lower recommended -- or getting a lower

21

recommended sentence is a necessary condition of

22

establishing your claim, but not a sufficient condition.

23

MR. CHING:

There, also, you could

Well, Marrero really is a case that

24

turns on a closer analysis of State statutes, and the

25

interrelation with the Federal system at that time between

1

the sentence pronounced, in actual terms of numbers of

2

years of incarceration, and the giving of parole, the

3

granting of parole.

4

In Marrero, there was no diminution to the

5

inmate involved.

6

third of the term had been served.

7

He remained parole ineligible until one-

QUESTION:

I --

Suppose there had been a change in

8

that respect?

Suppose that when the person is sentenced

9

he would come up for parole after one-third of the time of

10

the full sentence, and that is changed retroactively to

11

have him come up after he served one-half of the sentence.

12

Would that fall under the ex post facto ban?

13

MR. CHING:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And would you distinguish the parole

15

eligibility, the initial eligibility hearing from the

16

subsequent suitability hearing in that regard?

17

draw that -- you've given me a firm yes, if they change

18

the initial eligibility date to his detriment, that's ex

19

post facto, but if they change the later, the subsequent

20

reconsideration, which you call the suitability,

21

subsequent suitability hearings, that doesn't fall within

22

the ex post facto ban, so could you distinguish --

23

MR. CHING:

Yes.

Why do you

Your Honor, the opportunity

24

for receiving parole in Marrero was keyed directly to the

25

sentence pronounced in that case.

If you go to the hearing itself, however, and

1

2

you establish, according to established criteria with

3

written findings, that the individual had no possibility

4

of being paroled in the second or third year afterwards,

5

then there is actual proof of no substantial harm, as

6

opposed to the possibility that you may find some harm to

7

him if his initial hearing is postponed, okay.
There is nothing that precedes the initial

8

hearing which would indicate that he would not be
10

successful at that first hearing, and besides, it is a

11

condition which provides for some amelioration of his

12

term.

13

What I am saying is that the production of

14

written findings as to his status is sufficient proof

15

positive that although -- that is, although he might have

16

deserved an initial hearing, he certainly need not deserve

17

a hearing as frequently in the future.

18

QUESTION:

So if they just changed it from 1-

1

year interval to 2-year intervals, without any requirement

20

that the parole board find it unlikely --

21

MR. CHING:

22

QUESTION:

23

the ex post facto - -

24

MR. CHING:

25

Yes.
-- that that would also fall under

I think we're getting very close to

a possible ex post facto condition there.

The issue is whether or not the record supports

1

2

a finding of harm.

3

defined, but you can utilize some speculation about the

4

class as a whole, where you have nothing to indicate that

5

the individual is completely without any prospects for

6

parole.

7

Now, this is not, admittedly, well-

The basic problem is defining the nature of

8

substantial harm.

If the record provides solid and

9

unequivocal data that there could not be any harm because

10

he would not have been paroled in the intervening years

11

between the first and third year, I think there cannot be

12

any reasonable possibility, without countervailing data in

13

the record, that there is any substantial harm --

14

QUESTION:

And is the principal datum that you

15

rely upon the board's own determination that the hearing

16

was unnecessary?

17

MR. CHING:

Yes, Your Honor.

The agency is

18

entrusted by State law, and the standards are well-defined

19

and established in regulation and State law.

20

that an administrative agency performs its duty absent --

21

QUESTION:

We assume

Can the board, if it deems it

22

necessary because there's some dramatic change in

23

circumstances, rescind its determination and hold an

24

earlier hearing, notwithstanding the ruling that it made?

MR. CHING:

Certainly, Your Honor, and in - 9

to show that counsel is in error in that regard?

10

MR. CHING:

11

QUESTION:

I -I notice the California supreme

court, as I recall, said that it's conceivable a hearing

13

could be held, but --

MR. CHING:

the part of the -- California's highest court, and that is

not a very sound basis upon which --

MR. CHING:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. CHING:

Well, I believe -For us to base a decision.
-- the meaning of conceivability

there is that there is no specific regulation which

QUESTION:

You mean it's the practice, even if

they've made this finding that there's no reasonable

possibility?

MR. CHING:

QUESTION:

7

Yes.

I am informed --

Doesn't that indicate that the

finding should not be taken at face value?
MR. CHING:

8

No.

If the inmate should say,

within a year I have made such significant progress that

10

your prior finding about me is incorrect, the board will

review the file,

12

whether or not - -

13

it is my understanding, and consider

QUESTION:

That suggests that you can't be sure

14

at the time the finding is made because your procedures

15

allow second-guessing the finding.

16

MR. CHING:

Well, Your Honor, no.

What it shows

17

is a great deal of solicitude toward the inmates by the

18

board,

in that an inquiry -QUESTION:

19

Why would they show solicitude for an

20

inmate who there was no reasonable possibility of any

MR. CHING:

Oh, it's definitely conclusive

absent new information.

3

information -- for instance --

QUESTION:

If the inmate can produce new

information in the ensuing year or two.

school exam, or something.

8

every year, isn't there?

9

MR. CHING:

He'll always

There's always new information

Yes, and in fact the accumulation of

10

information would not be reviewed absent some direct

11

inquiry by the inmate, or until the preparation was made

12

for the postponed hearing.

13

QUESTION:

Can the inmate challenge the board's

14

determination that it would be -- it would not be

15

reasonable to expect parole within 3 years?

16

MR. CHING:

Yes, Your Honor.

Habeas corpus is

available to the inmate, and -- both in State and Federal

courts, but also --

apply to a State court for a habeas corpus because of the

2

postponement.
QUESTION:

3

Well, what good does it do for the

4

California legislature to pass a statute, then, that says

5

instead of having hearings every year we're going to have

6

them every 3 years, if every inmate that is disadvantaged

7

by that can go and get a State habeas petition?

8

MR. CHING:

9

QUESTION:

Well -Have there been cases, actual cases

10

in California where the California courts have reviewed

11

this sort of a determination by the parole board?
MR. CHING:

12

I have not personally handled any.

13

I do not have a citation for a published case at this

14

point.

However, I am certain that inmates have filed such

15

writs.

The writs, of course --

MR. CHING:

Yes.
You think the California courts, if

21

he made some sort of a showing that this was a disputed

22

determination and that he could come into habeas corpus

23

and say, look, they were wrong in saying I wouldn't be

24

eligible for parole because, you know, look at all the

25

good things in my background, and the habeas court would

pass on that one way or the other?
MR. CHING:

2

3

I believe that the courts retain

jurisdiction to do so.
QUESTION:

4

Well, that the --my question was, do

5

you think they would decide a case like this on the

6

merits?
MR. CHING:

7
8

I have not seen one, Your Honor.

I

believe it's theoretically possible.
QUESTION:

9

So it's speculative on your part

10

whether a habeas remedy is available, just as it's

11

speculative on your part in the California supreme

12

court's --or that the board might alter its decision and

13

hold an earlier hearing?

14

MR. CHING:

All this is speculation?

Your Honor, I can only point out

15

that as to the writ of habeas corpus, it's clearly within

16

the jurisdiction of the superior court to do so, and as to

17

the agency practice, I only know that it is practice and

18

it is not placed in any regulation which I may cite to you

19

today.

goes to prison is the first parole hearing at which he

MR. CHING:

8

9

His first parole hearing is the

minimum eligible parole date, which is the bottom of the

term pronounced -- that is 15 to life in this case --

minus such credits as he may have earned for good

behavior.

MR. CHING:

2

Yes, Your Honor, that would be

within the discretion that is commonly accorded to parole

boards throughout the Nation.

QUESTION:

ex post facto problem, if previous --

7

MR. CHING:

8

QUESTION:

9

You think that would not present an

If it had been modified.
Yes.

If the first rule were that you

have a parole hearing every 2 years, and then the

10

legislature modified it to say that you don't get the

11

hearing every 2 years, you just get it when the board

12

thinks that there's a likelihood that you'll be paroled.

13

MR. CHING:

I would not think it would present

14

an ex post facto problem if the findings that we have in

15

this case were made.

16

The mere prospect of a hearing is not sufficient

17

to deprive --to indicate a deprival of any substantial

18

right that he may have.

19

QUESTION:

But I thought you answered my

20

question earlier that if they cut the time back from

21

annual to 2-year intervals without requiring the parole

22

board to find anything at all about the particular

23

offender, that that would violate the ex post facto

24

clause.

25

MR. CHING:

My contention there was that without

1

the findings you have no way of determining the

2

individual's actual suitability for parole, hence you have

3

only considerations which may derive from the situation

4

presented by the increase in time, and therefore some

5

speculation may enter into the calculation of harm to the

6

class involved.

7

QUESTION:

Excuse me, I don't under -- the

burden, I thought your proposition was the burden is upon

9

the prisoner to show that harm accrued from the change.

MR. CHING:

Yes.
Well, if that's so, then whether

ex post facto implications were found.

My contention as to whether it's the

have presented here with a habeas corpus in which he bears

There are two extremes in parole systems, one in

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ASPERGER:

obligation to design the system such that the only

mechanism for parole consideration and release was a

affirmative decision to do so, as it did in this case, the

mechanism under the State law for a prisoner's release,

would be a violation if the initial eligibility date were

2

extended from one-third of the term of years to one-half.

3

There is no analytical distinction between that violation

4

of the ex post facto clause and this violation.

5

The Court asked the question about the finding

6

in this case.

7

ex post facto clause is somewhat of a red herring here.

8

The question is, could the legislature in the first

9

instance deny the opportunity for parole which was

10
11

I believe the finding for purposes of the

previously guaranteed by the statute for a period of time?
If the answer to that question is no, then the

12

legislature can't get around that violation by delegating

13

discretion to an administrative agency to do so.

14

You might take another example.

Take Lindsey

15

with a slight variation.

Lindsey provided for a 15-year

16

mandatory minimum sentence, and the Court found that to be

17

a violation.

18

instance, and then it's obvious, I think, that the

19

legislature could not say, we're going to retroactively

20

create a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years, so it

21

would be no less of a violation for the legislature to say

22

to the judge, you can now, judge, impose a term of years

23

retroactively for up to 30 years, the point being that the

24

delegation of discretion to do what the legislature could

25

not do in the first instance is just as much of a

Well, why isn't the distinction

judgment is, in fact, sound, then one could conclude, as

Mr. Ching argues, that the prisoner has in fact not lost

any.

10

It is discretion controlled by a probability

MR. ASPERGER:

I think there are at least two

11

responses to that question, Your Honor.

12

the changing of the standard to a probability

13

determination is very different from what the State had

14

set up in the first instance, and that was a guaranteed

15

annual consideration of all current facts to decide if,

16

over time, the prisoner had become suitable for release,

17

and many of the factors under the State - -

18

QUESTION:

First of all is,

Well, if I understand you, you're

19

saying that in fact the very definition of the sentence

20

includes these opportunities regardless of whether the

21

opportunities would be likely to result in release, that a

22

sentence is essentially different depending on whether

23

it's going to be reviewed every year or not, even in cases

24

in which the annual review can be assumed to have no

25

likely effect on the release date.

MR. ASPERGER:

I'm saying you have to start with

2

a State statute in the first instance, and since the State

3

statute here requires current present consideration of the

4

facts, a fresh look, based upon a prisoner's

5

rehabilitation and capacity to be reintegrated into

6

society, that the legislature cannot change the rules of

7

the game after the offense has been committed, and that is

8

an essential component here.

9

You can also look at it on a broader level, I

10

think, Your Honor and that is, if you compare, for

11

example, a life sentence that carries with it the

12

possibility of parole and a life sentence that does not

13

have any possibility of parole, although there's no

14

guarantee that the prisoner will get out, there's no

15

doubt, based upon common sense and practical experience,

16

that the life sentence without the possibility of parole

17

is more onerous.

18

This Court recognized that principle in Solomon

19

v. Helms for the Eighth Amendment purposes.

20

recognized that principle in Warden v. Marrero, when it

21

held that the taking away of parole eligibility is

22

punishment, and a penalty.

here, you have to move to a higher level of analysis.

statute as it was originally adopted, which doesn't say

17

the parole board has discretion to hold hearings whenever

18

it would like, it says it must hold hearings to give

19

defendants a fresh look, that is something substantive,

and the problem you're going to run into if you find

dealing with in this case is, does it violate the

Constitution to retroactively deny opportunities for

If a State can't eliminate the statute in its

entirety retroactively, then it can't do it in a slightly

10

less onerous way by eliminating part of that eligibility

11

for parole, and that comes back to the question that was

asked earlier.

about a category of murderers, because I don't see that as

4

distinguishable for ex post facto purposes.

5

I also think that when you get into analysis of

6

individual harm, as the State is asking you to do in this

7

case, you really open the floodgates to enormous

8

jurisprudential problems, and making those types of

9

considerations, whether it's individual or class, is going

10

to be something that is very difficult for the Court to

11

do.
And it also, even with this class of

12

13

individuals, over time, the fact of the matter is that

14

many life prisoners in California do get out.

15

not at age 54, like Mr. Morales is, but over time they

16

will, so that's another reason why the -- trying to

17

permit, or permitting the State to simply deny or delay

18

the hearing for a class of individuals as we have in this

19

case has no principal or logical stopping point.

So, 10 or 15 years.

Anyway,

Suppose they say, fine,

Does he get out the next day?

They have to set a release date

immediately.

QUESTION:

They could set one the next day?

13

MR. ASPERGER:

They could set one the next day,

14

they could set one in the future, and you'll notice in the

15

brief there's a reference to the matrix which would say,

16

in this case it's 19 years.

17

prison credit that comes out of that base term of

18

confinement, and there's also good-time credit there, so

19

it is possible, depending on what the parole board does

20

with the 1,050 days' mandatory credit and good-time

credit, he could be -- he could have been released in

That's correct, because this is

MR. ASPERGER:

That

eligibility for parole.

2

But I think the key question that you have to

3

look at is, does the statute affect the eligibility for

4

parole and in fact deny him eligibility for parole for

5

longer than it originally granted that eligibility, and

6

then once you answer that question, there is a violation

7

or there isn't, there's no distinction that I think is

meaningful between 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, and 50

years.
QUESTION:

MR. ASPERGER:

12

Well, you -- what is -- that's

13

not what the statute granted, Your Honor.

14

granted a hearing once a year, and so my assumption is

15

that the substance of what he is being given here is a

16

hearing once a year, so given that assumption, whether the

17

hearing is on Monday or Tuesday is not a violation.

18

QUESTION:

The statute

Well, do you say -- if he was granted

19

a hearing once a year, supposing his last hearing was on

20

January 15th, 1994, and that the parole board must grant

21

him a hearing by January 15th, 1995, what if they said,

22

we're just not meeting in January, we're meeting in

23

February, and we'll hear him then, so instead of getting a

24

hearing once a year, he's gotten a hearing once every 13

25

months?

MR. ASPERGER:

1

Then, based upon the text of the

2

statute and what is granted in the first instance, there

3

is a violation, because the guarantee was once a year.

4

In that analysis, the practical effect would be

5

you'd probably find it's a harmless error if they

6

conferred the hearing in February.

7

QUESTION:

But is that -- do we ordinarily

8

decide ex post facto claims on the basis of harmless

9

error?
MR. ASPERGER:

10

No, not in the first instance.

11

You would find a violation, but if he got the hearing,

12

then you'd have to do an individual analysis at the time

13

it reached the courts about whether he was harmed about

14

it, but he does have to have that hearing every year and

15

that arises from the language or the substance of the

16

guarantee under the statute.

17

QUESTION:

You're saying he's harmed even if

1

that that can occur or has ever occurred.

More

2

importantly, neither the statute nor the regulation

3

provides any mechanism whatsoever for the prisoner to

4

have -- to send a letter for the parole board to consider

5

that letter for having a reconsideration of the hearing.
I think the focus for ex post facto purposes has

6

7

to be what the statutes and the law provide, not what the

8

board may do in exercising discretion outside the law.
In addition, I think given the California

9
10

statute as it was in effect when Morales committed his

11

offense, the substance of that statute was a hearing, a

12

full-blown hearing on the merits, a fresh look at the

13

facts, and sending a letter is vastly different from

14

having that hearing that was guaranteed in the first

15

instance.

16

Now, I think that in looking at this case,

17

another thing that is important to consider is that if the

18

Court is to find there's no ex post factor violation in

19

this case, it in effect undermines, and the way that I

20

would interpret that decision overrules Lindsey, Weaver,

21

and Miller.

22

The focus in each of those cases was on the

23

opportunities for the prisoner to receive a sentence that

24

was less onerous, or less burdensome.

25

State made exactly the argument that the State of

In each case, the

1

California is making here.
The individual offender cannot show that in his

2

3

particular case he would have received a less onerous

4

sentence, so I don't think the standard can change for

5

purposes of Mr. Morales.

6

State is asking for significantly undercuts and

7

ultimately, I think, leads to the demise of that principle

8

set forth in each of those cases.
QUESTION:

9

To adopt the position that the

But could the State in those cases

10

show that he would not have received a less onerous

11

sentence?

12

that by reason of the finding the State has shown that he

13

wouldn't have.

14

I mean, that's what the contention is here,

MR. ASPERGER:

I don't think the State in this

15

case can show that he would not have received a less

16

onerous -- less onerous sentence, because if you put

17

yourself back in the position of the board in 1989, the

18

board is making a prediction of the future, when in fact

19

it may change over time based upon the considerations that

20

are pertinent by the very terms of the statute.

21

And the finding, as I mentioned earlier, is not,

22

no way will he get out, but it's not reasonable to expect

23

that he might get out.

24

things could change during that period of delay, and

25

again, I think it raises the problem of the slippery

If

QUESTION:

5

There certainly are prisoners in

6

California, like Charles Manson and whatever -- Sirhan

Sirhan -- who have just been up for parole and been

repeatedly denied parole, presumably because of the nature

of their offenses.
Are you saying that the parole board could never

guy is a double ax murderer, and we don't care if he's a

while?

back, that Charles Manson has had a number of parole

hearings and never gotten out.

people in California prisons who are regarded as, just

6

because of the nature of their offenses, they are not

7

likely to be paroled very soon.

8

9

MR. ASPERGER:

There must be a class of

There are, Your Honor, but again,

they were given that right to have the fresh consideration

10

each year, and in Charlie Manson's case, it may be that

11

they hold that hearing each year and decide, he's not

12

going to get out, but being denied the hearing under

13

California State law as it was set up was something

14

substantive and meaningful as the statute was designed.

15

QUESTION:

Well, but then you're getting away

16

from what Justice Breyer called the practical approach.

17

You know, does this really make any difference, and you're

18

saying that because there was something technically there

19

before that's not here now, there has been a violation of

20

the ex post facto clause.

21

MR. ASPERGER:

I think that looking even at

22

somebody like Mr. Morales, Your Honor, over time the facts

23

are going to change such that he very well may get out,

24

and statistically, depending upon the individual

25

proclivities of particular boards, prisoners like

1

Mr. Morales did, in fact, get out, so put the hearing

2

ahead 10 years.

3

they made the same finding, it has a real, substantive

4

effect on Mr. Morales.

He's in his sixties.

He's no danger. If

5

I think it is a mistake to focus solely on the

6

individual offender, or even the categories of offenders

7

when you're talking about the retroactive clause.

8

9

The core concerns are at the very heart of this
statute, because given the current national mood to keep

10

prisoners in jail for longer than they've been in jail, to

11

lock prisoners up for longer periods of time, the State

12

can deal with offenses that are committed in the future,

13

but it can't deal under the ex post facto clause with

14

offenses that were committed in the past unless it tries

15

to do it in this back-door sort of way, by saying we're

16

not going to take away parole, we're just going to take

17

away eligibility, the right to a hearing.

18

Now, I was trying to think about an analogy that

19

might be appropriate, and I think it's very tough, because

20

analogies are dangerous, and they just -- they aren't

21

particularly apropos, but one other way of looking at this

22

might be, for example, if the commissioner of baseball

23

were to change the rules so that the umpire could make a

24

determination in the first instance that this batter has

25

such a lousy batting average, and this pitcher is so good,

that I'm going to look at you and call you out before you

get up to the plate.
That would be a meaningful, substantive change

3
4

in the rules of baseball, and that is a meaningful change

5

here, not necessarily because Mr. Morales individually

6

would have gotten out at this point in time, but the way

the system was set up, this substantive hearing was the

essence of the State system.
