ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. SCOTT SNYDER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. SNYDER:

11
12

The Court remains in session.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

13

This case presents the Court with one question.

14

Are traditional zoning schemes, which set aside a portion

15

of the community for the exclusive use of the family, as

16

defined in accordance with the decisions of this Court,

17

exempt from the reasonable accommodation requirements of

18

the Fair Housing Act Amendments under section 3607(b)(1),

19

exempting any reasonable local restriction on the maximum

20

number of occupants who may occupy a dwelling?

21

If Congress is to overturn over 70 years of

22

Federal deference to local zoning decisions, and to limit

23

communities' ability to set aside a portion of the

24

community for the exclusive use of the family, we believe

25

it should be required to do so in clear, unequivocal

2

language stated on the face of the statute.
As Justice Marshall stated in his dissent in

3

Belle Terre, zoning is the most important function

4

performed by local government.

5

The city believes that the Eleventh Circuit's

6

decision in the City of Athens case, using the exemption

7

to permit a threshold inquiry into the reasonableness of

8

local zoning ordinances, furthers a number of important

9

policy considerations and meets the intent of Congress.

10

First, to do so preserves the traditional

11

deference which this Court and the Federal courts have

12

given to local zoning decisions and legislative decisions

13

allocating portions of the community.

14

Secondly, such an interpretation prevents the

15

FHA from coming into conflict, potentially, with

16

constitutional concerns raised by the amicus Pacific Legal

17

Foundation.

18

Third, to do so permits the Federal courts to

19

continue to prohibit exactly the type of discrimination

20

referenced in the joint committee report, that is,

21

Cleburne-type discrimination, in which groups of disabled

22

persons are judged on a different basis or subjected to

23

differing requirements than groups of other unrelated

24

individuals.

25

Finally, using the reasonableness standard, as

opposed to the reasonable accommodation standard, prevents

2

the Federal courts from having to make inquiries,

3

individual fact-based inquiries, into the individual

4

siting decisions of group homes based in large part upon

5

the specific characteristics of a particular program.
We believe that the Ninth Circuit was wrong in

6

7

their decision in our case when it asserted that the vast

8

majority of zoning ordinances would go unreviewed.

9

reasonableness standard which the Court has applied in a

The

10

variety of constitutional cases, beginning with Euclid,

11

provide a structural review of zoning ordinances which is

12

consistent with the pattern of decisionmaking of this

13

Court.

14

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that the statute

15

does nothing more than impose the constitutional standard

16

on municipalities?

17

MR. SNYDER:

The Fair Housing Act Amendments

18

accomplished many things.

For example, it set up a

19

conciliation and review process.

20

particularly in the joint committee report, is that the

21

only case cited, and the only evil described with respect

22

to what the Congress was trying to cure with respect to

23

local zoning ordinances, was Cleburne-type discrimination.

24

Cleburne is cited twice, both in the general comments and

25

the specific section-by-section comments.

What I point to,

There are other things, obviously, that the act

1

2

did.

3

provides an administrative structure, potentially lessens

4

the burdens on the courts, and allows a way for disabled

5

individuals to have their problems addressed with the

6

assistance of HUD investigators.

7

For example, having the conciliation process

QUESTION:

Mr. Snyder, I may not understand your

8

argument, but if all the -- if the act's objective was

9

limited to avoiding Cleburne, or Cleburne kind of

10

discrimination, why would it also have put in the

11

requirement of reasonable adjustment of the zoning

12

ordinances to achieve the objects of the act?

13

MR. SNYDER:

The reasonable accommodation

14

standard is most frequently discussed in the comments as

15

they address structural issues:

16

stairs, the same sort of barrier-free removal which have

17

occurred in -- through the ADA, for example.

18

QUESTION:

exiting, entrances,

So you're saying the reasonable

19

accommodations are just as you put, structural, physical,

20

not doctrinal, certainly.

21

MR. SNYDER:

I guess the city's position would

22

rely, perhaps, on a stronger point, we believe, and that's

23

the plain meaning of the statute itself, and particularly

24

the exemption.

25

In our reply brief we cite Rice v. the Board of

1

Trade case, which was a situation in which there was a

2

general prohibition of a certain type of regulation, and

3

then an exemption created for reasonable rules created in

4

a certain area, the breadth of the exemption itself, which

5

refers to any reasonable local limitation.

6

7

Secondly, this Court and the Federal courts, as
they've discussed --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SNYDER:

10

QUESTION:

But that isn't quite right.
-- excuse me.
It say, any reasonable.

It says,

11

any -- doesn't it limit it to ordinances that control the

12

maximum number of occupants?

13

MR. SNYDER:

14

QUESTION:

15

Correct.
So at least we've got to decide

whether it's that kind of ordinance.

16

MR. SNYDER:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

Well, it says any reasonable local

19

ordinance imposing a maximum.

20

in accordance with the purposes of the act, or is it

21

reasonable from the standpoint of general zoning laws, or

22

do we know?

23

MR. SNYDER:

Yes, sir.
You haven't said --

Is "reasonable" determined

Well, I think there are probably

24

two sources of law.

25

it implies a balancing test, obviously.

When you see the word "reasonable,"

(202)289-2260

We think that the

1

first level of inquiry in terras of structural review would

2

be to resort to the decisions of this Court, which in four

3

or five decisions have looked at local zoning ordinances

4

and determined certain attributes to be reasonable in a

5

constitutional sense.
QUESTION:

6
7

Process Clause?

9

Again,

That would be one of the standards.

I -- the -QUESTION:

10
11

Is that the point?

MR. SNYDER:

8

You mean reasonable under the Due

Well,

I assume that's -- that must be

assumed.

12

MR. SNYDER:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.
I mean, any zoning ordinance has to

14

pass due process muster, or --

15

MR. SNYDER:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SNYDER:

Yes,

sir.

So that doesn't help us much.
I think,

as I said,

there are

18

several levels of inquiry.

19

probably an analogy would be best.

20

immediately south of the City of Edmonds which is

21

comprised solely of single family zoning, but which has an

22

identical definition of family to that of the City of

23

Edmonds.

24
25

The second level of inquiry,
There's a community

Applied -- the same ordinance,

or the same

definition of family in that community, would work to

1

exclude the disabled from the community.

2

difference in the City of Edmonds' structure is that

3

Edmonds affirmatively amended its ordinance to remove the

4

Cleburne-type discrimination and to open other zoning

5

districts of the city to group home use.
QUESTION:

6

The key

Well, my only question is, does

7

"reasonable" in the exceptions clause set forth at page 2

8

of your brief, do we determine "reasonable" with reference

9

to the objectives of this act?
MR. SNYDER:

10

I believe it has a broader

11

significance, looking to the structure and history of the

12

purposes of zoning ordinances as developed over the past

13

70 years.

14

The very nature of a zoning ordinance -QUESTION:

If it has a broader purpose, does it

15

also include the purposes of this act, or do we only reach

16

the purposes of this act after we have found out that this

17

is somehow a valid, reasonable zoning ordinance with

18

reference to standards that are outside the act?

19

MR. SNYDER:

The latter, with a qualification,

20

sir.

21

test, looking at both the law and the facts.

22

depth of inquiry, that individualized fact-based inquiry

23

that reasonable accommodation has been given under the ADA

24

and other statutes.

25

I think, again, reasonableness implies a balancing

ability of a community to distinguish and classify uses.

2

An ordinance which set up unreasonable categories would be

3

exclusionary in that sense.

4

categorizes on a reasonable basis is definitional in

5

nature and also is the very purpose of zoning.
QUESTION:

6

An ordinance which

It seems to me that's the threshold

7

question -- maybe I'm missing something -- that it's a

8

particular kind of ordinance.

9

relates to the maximum number of people that occupy the

It has to be one that

property.

11

MR. SNYDER:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SNYDER:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct.
That's the only exemption, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
So you have to convince us, and maybe

15

you're right, that this is such an ordinance, even before

16

we decide whether it's reasonable.

17

MR. SNYDER:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SNYDER:

Yes, sir.
Yes.
The respondents assert that because

20

the Uniform Housing Code, which the City of Edmonds has

21

adopted, is specifically mentioned in the comments, that

22

that is the only, the sole and only type of occupancy

23

limit that can be asserted.

24
25

QUESTION:

As we know --

Well, Edmonds, the city does have and

has adopted a provision that would limit the maximum

1

number of occupants based on the square footage per person

2

available in the dwelling, right?

3

MR. SNYDER:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.
And the argument of the other side

5

is, that's the kind of ordinance this Federal law refers

6

to.

7

MR. SNYDER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SNYDER:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.
And not your definition of family.
That's correct, and I think that's

10

the key distinction in the case.

11

examples, I think, would be helpful at this point.

12

Three reasons or

The UHC, the Uniform Housing Code, is directly

13

mentioned in the comments, but the plain meaning of the

14

statute goes on to use "any reasonable limitation," to me

15

clearly implying that there are other reasonable occupancy

16

limits that can be employed.

17

If they had meant to say, the UHC and square

18

footage limitations they could -- are the only type that

19

could have been permitted, they should have said so.

20

QUESTION:

So you concede, then, that if it

21

didn't have the provision for five unrelated members, if

22

the definition of family in the Edmonds provision just

23

meant individuals married, related by genetics, et cetera,

24

and there was no provision for five or fewer, you wouldn't

25

have a prayer of coming within this exemption.

MR. SNYDER:

In addition to having Belle Terre

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I'm sorry, I'm so far

behind the curve on this one, I don't even understand what

violation you need an exemption from.

that you come in within the exemption.

violation that you have to be exempted from?

MR. SNYDER:

You come in arguing
What is the

It is asserted by the Government,

11

and has been since 1990, that the mere existence of a

12

definition of family in the City of Edmonds which sets a

13

limit on the number of individuals who may occupy a

14

dwelling --

Yes.
-- is in violation of the FHAA,

because a group home -QUESTION:

What provision does it violate, is

19

what I'm concerned about.

The only provision I can find

20

is the provision that says its unlawful to discriminate

21

against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges

22

of sale or rental because of a handicap, and then it

23

defines discriminate to include a refusal to make

24

reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices,

or services.

I note

2

the Government in its brief in this case constantly refers

3

to zoning rules.

rules.

5

suddenly there's this category of zoning rules.

6

acknowledge that a refusal to make reasonable

accommodation in laws comes within that phrase, in rules,

policies, practices, or services?

to put it, isn't it?

We always say zoning ordinances, zoning laws, but

MR. SNYDER:

2

QUESTION:

I have not, sir.
I thought your point was when you get

3

so specific as to list things, rules, policies, practices,

4

services, if you meant laws and ordinances, you would have

5

said them.
MR. SNYDER:

6

I think that's correct.

Let me

7

come at it from a slightly different -- let me agree with

8

you in a different way, if you will.

9

QUESTION:

Isn't there some experience with this

10

language in Federal legislation and accommodations, let's

11

say in the employment area, where it has not been limited

12

to something lesser than law?
MR. SNYDER:

13
14

I'm not aware of that distinction,

Your Honor.

15

QUESTION:

Reasonable accommodations, say the

16

notion with respect to religion in title VII, isn't this a

17

familiar qualification, that you sometimes are permitted

18

to make distinctions if it costs too much if the

accommodation isn't reasonable?

You say we don't even have to bother with what this

2

provision about reasonable accommodation means, because we

3

are just totally out of it.

4

MR. SNYDER:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
We're out of it under the exemption,

6

so Justice Scalia's point might be a live, active point if

7

you're wrong about the exemption, but you said -- say this

8

legislation doesn't touch us for reason A.

9

doesn't touch you for reason B, but we're here arguing

10

Maybe it

about what this 3607(b)(1) means.
MR. SNYDER:

11

That's correct.

Again, 3607(b)(1),

12

and this is the second part to my answer to Justice

13

Scalia, sets up three categories.

14

State, and local limitations.

15

zoning authorities has been top-down categorizations,

16

dividing communities into districts, categorizing on the

17

basis of common attributes, in effect setting aside

18

portions of the community, the basic building block of

19

QUESTION:

It discusses Federal,

The traditional role of

And we had gotten to the point where

21

you said, if we had as the definition of the family simply

22

related people, then you would not have a prayer of coming

within this exemption, whatever else might take you out of

QUESTION:

;

So you are depending on what is a

tag-on to the definition of family, in this case five or
3

fewer people -- in Belle Terre, what was it, two people?

4

MR. SNYDER:

5

QUESTION:

You're saying that that little tail

on the basic provision which defines family is what gets

you into this exemption.

QUESTION:

MR. SNYDER:

13

QUESTION:

16
17
18

Why is it that you concede that a

requirement that persons be related is not a maximum?

12

14
15

It makes it a -- an occupancy

limit, that's correct.

10

£
' J

Correct.

Simply because -It's true that it's not a knowable

number.
MR. SNYDER:

I take your point.

It's basically Moore v. East Cleveland and the
constitutional limitation on the city's ability -QUESTION:

Is it not because the statute says

19

maximum number, and definition of family is limitless as

20

far as number is concerned?

21
22
23
24
25

MR. SNYDER:

It's correct that it's limitless as

far as the definition is defined.

numerical limit, isn't it?

1

2

We ascertain whether the people are

3

MR. SNYDER:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

because anybody that's not related takes it over the

numerical limit.

MR. SNYDER:

QUESTION:

Well, so do you think that this is a

maximum, then, under the definition of (b)(1)?

believe that the record shows an associated basis --

I take your point.

was enacted at the State legislature in conjunction with

an adoption of the Fair Housing Act Amendments.

4

It's been incorporated in the Growth Management

Act for the State of Washington, RCW Chapter 3670A, or

annually conduct a special needs population assessment to

determine what the needs of the disabled are in each

community and to plan for them.

10

Now, we believe that that's the proper role of

local government, is to take that big picture approach,

determine how many group homes require siting, how much of

a community needs to be set aside, and then to properly

In 1988, Congress extended the Fair Housing Act

to handicapped persons Congress knew must live in group

homes in residential areas.

If the city's construction of

the statute is correct, it means that all local

Congress meant to exclude group homes.
A second reason, Your Honor, is, as you

described the ruling of the district court, and as you

Is that your -- no matter if the ordinance is

MR. SHEEHAN:

restrictions that housing codes typically impose, a group

QUESTION:

That means you could build, you know,

80-story group homes in otherwise single family areas.
MR. SHEEHAN:

No, Your Honor, but I have to jump

ahead again to the merits to say why that's not correct.
An 80-story group home would not be entitled to

18

a reasonable accommodation, but the ordinance that would

19

be subject to the 80-story group home would not be exempt

20

from a merits review under the statute unless it were

21

written in the terms that we say Congress meant to exempt,

22

namely, proscriptions on -- I mean to say, restrictions on

the number of people who can occupy a particular dwelling

of that dwelling.

Mr. Sheehan you refer to health and

No, it doesn't, and the reason

17

that we believe that Congress intended to exempt only

18

health and safety related rules such as you find in a

20

exception, and it stems, as was noted earlier, from the

concern that large families might insist upon living in

MR. BENDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justce, and

may it please the Court:

9

The only question before the Court in this case

10

is, as both other counsel have said, the question whether

11

Edmonds' definition of family that limits the number of

12

unrelated persons who may live together in certain areas

13

of the city, is a law regarding the maximum number of

14

occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.
The questions that were raised, have been raised

15
16

during oral argument by Justice Scalia and others about

17

whether zoning provisions are covered and about whether

18

this kind of restriction can constitute a discrimination,

19

are ones on which the Government has taken a uniform

20

position and ones on which the decisions below are

21

uniform.

There have been no decisions in this Court.

22

Ordinarily one would think the

threshold question would be the other one, rather than

3

this one.
MR. BENDER:

4

I agree with you completely, and I

5

was confused by this case for a couple of weeks, because I

6

kept coming at it backwards, but that's because there was

7

a motion for summary judgment based on this exemption,

8

which would, it was alleged, take it out of the housing

9

act completely.
Our position is that this Edmonds ordinance is

10
11

not a provision regarding the maximum number of occupants

12

permitted to occupy a dwelling.

13

me, it would have to answer the question, what is the

14

maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a

15

dwelling?

This Edmonds ordinance does not answer that

16

question.

You cannot tell from it what the maximum number

17

of persons permitted to occupy --

reason -- this exemption came into the statute along with,

2

in 1988, along with the prohibitions on discrimination

3

against the handicapped and discrimination on grounds of

4

family status.

5

It wasn't in there before, and the reason it's

6

in there is because it was feared that without this kind

7

of exemption people with large families who sought to live

8

in small apartments so that they would have five or six

9

people in a bedroom, when told you can't do that because

10

the bedroom isn't large enough for five or six people,

11

would say, but you can't tell us that, because that would

12

be a discrimination against us on grounds of family

13

status, and this was put in there to make sure that people

14

could not use the housing act to insulate themselves, to

15

immunize themselves against their violation of health and

16

safety regulations.

17

QUESTION:

But the Government doesn't take that

18

position, does it, that the exemption only applies to what

19

it was, you tell us it was intended to cover, and that is,

20

the family status provision, so you didn't have to bring

21

in someone with eight children if the apartment doesn't

have room for eight children.

in the legislation.

relates not just to the familial status provision but,

about it, try to think of, are there other provisions of

2

the housing act that people might use to defend themselves

3

against overcrowding limitations, and it's a stretch to

4

think of them, but it would be possible.

5

Somebody might say, somebody -- a member of a

6

minority group with a large family might say, large

7

families are more prevalent in minority groups than

8

anywhere else, and therefore you can't use your

overcrowding limitation against me, because it has a

includes discriminatory impact.

to use the handicapped provision or the race

21

that people should have very large families, and somebody

22

would say well, my religion tells me I have to have all

therefore I'm entitled to violate the overcrowding

provisions.

1

I think Congress meant to say you couldn't use

2

that provision of the statute, either, and that's because

3

they thought that these overcrowding provisions and the

4

debates in Congress are full of this, that these

5

overcrowding provisions are so important, because they

relate to disease, they relate to fire, they relate to

epidemics, those kinds of things.

that they should not be trumked.

10

QUESTION:

They should not

Well, the reason for the overcrowding

11

provision in a normal municipal ordinance applies equally

whether the people are handicapped or not.

13

MR. BENDER:

That's right, and the reason is so

strong that it overcomes the effects protection on

discrimination against any of these, handicapped or

16

others, if it applies.

17

And I think that's also important, that

18

principle is also important whether you look to see

19

whether the city's view in this case is tenable, is being

20

consistent with Congress' purpose and I think, as has been

21

said, it's not, because if this ordinance were permitted

22

to come within the exception, that would mean that cities

23

could fence out handicapped people from living in certain

24

areas of the city in those circumstances where handicapped

No more than one would say that a city could,

through a no-animals rule, or a no-pets rule, fence out

blind people from living in that part of the city because

they need to have a guide dog, would Congress have wanted

to say that cities can say, handicapped people who need

congregate living arrangements -- and there are lots of

8

groups of handicapped that do.

9

for example, mentally retarded people, AIDS victims, often

11

The elderly handicapped,

need to live in these arrangements.
They need the support of a minimum number of

12

people in order to be able to live, especially with

13

economic factors that mean that they have to share the

14

costs, and so they need a minimum number of people to get

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Bender, is it your position that

17

any numerical limitation that has an exception is not a

numerical limitation, because I mean, you know, you could

read this ordinance, or you could write it differently.

20

You could say, no house in this area of the city shall

have more than five occupants unless it is a family.

they were fairly limited --

MR. BENDER:

QUESTION:

It has to be extraordinary -It would be --- and the difference here is that

families are not extraordinary.

15

MR. BENDER:

The basic rule, Justice Scalia, I

16

think is you have to be able to look at the ordinance and

17

see a limit on the maximum number of occupants, and the

18

reason why we think that is because the reason for this

19

exception was to permit local and State and Federal laws

20

that limited occupancy for reasons that have nothing to do

21

with what kind of occupants they are.

with overcrowding, and so as long as the ordinance doesn't

This case has never been about whether disabled persons

should be excluded from the City of Edmonds, but simply

limit on the number of related individuals, was a

violation of the Fair Housing Act Amendment.
