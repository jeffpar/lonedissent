ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. RENNER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RENNER:

9
10

please the Court:
I will attempt to preserve several minutes for

11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

rebuttal.
This Court today is faced with a factual pattern

13
14

which requires the analysis of the friction that is

15

created when two prongs of the First Amendment rub against

16

each other.

17

workable rule that any purely religious display which is

18

unattended and positioned at the very seat of Government

19

should be considered as a violation of the Establishment

20

Clause.

21
22

23

Ohio suggests that this Court adopt a

QUESTION:

Mr. Renner, what do you mean when you

say at the very seat of Government?
MR. RENNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, the seat of

24

Government would be a building or structure from which the

25

public realizes the power of Government does its work.

This could be obviously a capital building, it could be a

2

city hall, it could be a county courthouse, it could be a

3

Federal building.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Would it have to be located, say, at

least in a county seat?
MR. RENNER:

I am not aware -- well, I don't

7

think there are any -- there would be Federal post office

8

buildings that, for instance in cities other than county

9

seats which --

10

QUESTION:

So when you say the seat of

11

Government, you're not talking about a geographical

12

location of a capital or a county seat.

13

MR. RENNER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

We're

14

talking about a facility which the reasonable observer,

15

the public, the common man, would associate as being

16

governmental in its authority and from which governmental

17

activities are carried out.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Well, do you really mean, then,

anything more than a Government building?
MR. RENNER:

Probably not, Your Honor.

There

21

are probably some Government buildings that are in rented

22

office structures, for instance, and which the reasonable

23

observer might not recognize the building as that of

24

Government, in which case our rule would not carry the

25

same weight.

QUESTION:

1

Do you think the reasonable observer

2

can conclude that petition and assembly are important

3

activities to take place at the seat of Government,

4

assuming that that is a valid legal category?
MR. RENNER:

5

Well, Justice Kennedy, the

6

reasonable observer does understand that assemblies,

7

demonstrations, speeches and rallies take place at the

8

seat of Government frequently, yes.
QUESTION:

9
10

forum, in your view?
MR. RENNER:

11
12

And is the Capitol Square a public

Justice O'Connor, the Capitol

Square has been recognized -- certainly the State of

3

Ohio's Capitol Square has been recognized as a public

4

forum.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. RENNER:

And do you accept that?
We accept that it is a public

7

forum, Your Honor, but if I could explain that just

8

because it is a public forum doesn't mean that unattended

9

displays are recognized as being anything other than a

20
21

governmental display.
QUESTION:

Well, now, as I understand it, at one

22

time the board here had adopted a regulation saying that

23

all displays on the square had to be attended by someone.

24

Wasn't that the regulation?

25

MR. RENNER:

I believe there was -5

QUESTION:

1

the Christmas season?

3

MR. RENNER:

No unattended displays permitted at

Well, that's correct.

I think the

4

tenor of the resolution was there would be no displays at

5

the Statehouse grounds, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

6

And that would have been a content-

7

neutral sort of a time, place, and manner regulation, I

8

suppose.

9
10

MR. RENNER:

We would certainly believe that's

correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

11

And the board could certainly adopt

12

that as a policy, couldn't it?

13

MR. RENNER:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And it also, I suppose, could

15

designate a certain part of the Capitol Square where it

16

would allow displays by different groups.

17
18

MR. RENNER:
Honor.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. RENNER:

21

22

And it hasn't attempted to do that.
It didn't attempt to adopt that --

it adopted the regulation you first suggested, but did
not - -

QUESTION:

1

Has the board permitted other groups

2

to have displays in the Capitol Square area during the

3

holiday season?

4

MR. RENNER:

Yes.

I guess I have to answer yes,

5

Your Honor, because the State itself has a holiday

6

display.

7

Christmas tree.

8

previous holiday displays, it has allowed the petition of

9

one of the Jewish branches in the city to erect a menorah

The State owns the holiday display.

It owns the

As part of a previous holiday, several

in conjunction with that holiday display.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. RENNER:

And any other groups?
The United Way at one time

13

requested the State to have positioned in front of the

14

State Capitol building a thermometer showing the progress

15

of the United Way Campaign in the community, which the

16

State readily approved.

17
18

QUESTION:

And has the board denied access to

Capitol Square to groups other than the KKK?

19

MR. RENNER:

Your Honor, other than the ones

20

that you and I have just discussed, I'm not aware of any

21

petitions for unattended displays on the Statehouse

22

grounds.

23

QUESTION:

One last question.

I understand that

24

the cross that was erected or proposed to be erected and

25

in fact was by the KKK here had a disclaimer attached to

it saying it was not a display of the Government.
MR. RENNER:

2

That's correct, Your Honor, and I

3

believe there's a photograph attached to the documents

4

presented to the Court of the disclaimer.

5

cardboard nature which did receive immediate wind damage,

6

but it was there.

7

QUESTION:

It was of a

And, of course, the board could have

8

required other types of disclaimers on more permanent

9

material if it chose, could it not?
MR. RENNER:

10

There is an infinite variety of

11

potential disclaimers that could be employed.

12

correct, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

You're

Mr. Renner, one of the points that

14

you make is that the court of appeals seem to have applied

15

a rule that so long as the forum is public, and so long as

16

the actual sponsor is private, that's the end of the

17

matter, and I'm not sure that the court of appeals applied

18

that rule.

19

I'm looking at page A8 of the petition appendix,

20

and on that page the court quotes from a prior case,

21

refers to those two factors, but the quotation goes on to

22

say,

23

determinative, recent precedent indicates that they should

24

carry much more weight than the details of the display

25

emphasized by the plaintiffs."

"Although these facts are not automatically

1

Now, I might very well agree with you that the

2

manner in which the appearance of this display was

3

analyzed was not a very nuanced treatment, but I also have

4

difficulty in going as far as you would have us go and say

5

that the court of appeals was just applying an automatic

6

rule, public forum, private sponsor, end of issue, because

7

it did say that these are not automatically determinative.

8

9
10

Why should we find a legal error on the record
that we have, including the court's opinion?
MR. RENNER:

Justice Souter, the reason that we

11

believe that there was legal error in the Sixth Circuit is

12

because, though there were various portions of the Sixth

3

Circuit decision which address other factors -- it even

4

mentioned the enforcement analysis -- the court still

5

pronounced as its conclusion that any private speech in a

6

public forum is permissible.

7

It didn't say, any private speech which doesn't

8

impact reasonable observers in a negative way or in a

9

positive way with regard to their understanding of the

20

religious nature.

21

that's accompanied by a disclaimer.

22

conclusion, that any private speech in a public forum is

23

appropriate speech regardless of its content.

24
25

QUESTION:

It didn't say, any private speech

clear as to what kind of unattended displays were

3

season, I understand, but during that season, could the

4

Libertarian Party have put up a display?

5

MR. RENNER:

Did they have to be related
It was only during the holiday

Justice Scalia, the answer to that

6

question is no.

The display that was permitted at the

7

Statehouse ground involved a long tradition of Ohio's

8

owned and operated Christmas tree.

9

Once various courts of this land, including our

10

own Sixth Circuit, and some analysis by this Court in the

11

Allegheny case, determined that a holiday display which

12

included both a Christmas tree and the menorah was not a

3

purely religious display but had a holiday connotation,

4

Ohio followed that pronouncement and permitted the

5

erection of the menorah.

6

QUESTION:

But there was that content limitation

on unattended displays.

8

were going to allow were those whose message pertained to

9

the holidays, and none others.

20

MR. RENNER:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. RENNER:

The only unattended displays you

Well -Can you do that?
You're correct, Justice Scalia, the

23

State, of course, which was making its decisions under the

24

guidance of court determinations, had concluded that it

25

would be an Establishment Clause violation to allow purely

religious displays to be exhibited.
QUESTION:

2

I'm not talking about purely

3

religious.

4

limit your permission for unattended displays to just

5

those that have to do with the holiday season and for all

6

other purposes no one can have an unattended display?

7

I'm talking about anything else.

MR. RENNER:

Can you

Oh, I think not, Your Honor.

If in

8

fact displays are going to be permitted in the public

9

forum, we think the State probably has the right to say,

10

no displays may be presented.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. RENNER:

3

Yes.
But if displays are going to be

presented --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. RENNER:

Right.
-- then the free speech and equal

6

access provisions would require us to provide them to all

7

speech content.

8

QUESTION:

9

put up an unattended display.

20
21
22

So the Libertarian Party could have

MR. RENNER:

That would be my under -- as long

as it were not purely religious, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I see.

Now, why wouldn't the State

23

be worried that people would think the State was endorsing

24

the Libertarian Party?

25

MR. RENNER:

They might be, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

2

MR. RENNER:

3

QUESTION:

The State can endorse the Libertarian

Party?

6

MR. RENNER:

7

QUESTION:

8

Well, there's no proscription in

the Constitution that the State may not be involved --

4
5

But that's okay.

I'm not aware of a restriction.
If you want to be a real Ohioan you

should support the Libertarian Party?
MR. RENNER:

9

They can say that?

Well, I would hope that they

10

wouldn't, Your Honor, but I don't think it's violation of

11

the Establishment Clause.
QUESTION:

12

They really can support a particular

13

political party officially and say you're not -- you know,

14

you're not a patriotic Ohioan if you don't vote

15

Libertarian?

16

MR. RENNER:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. RENNER:

Well, I -I wasn't aware of that.
Well, as I'm standing here, Your

19

Honor, I'm trying to think of what proscription in the

20

Constitution or the Bill of Rights which would proscribe

21

that.

22

proscription.

23

It certainly would not be an Establishment Clause

But you wouldn't worry

case, you wouldn't worry about that being identified with

MR. RENNER:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

Well
--by allowing it up in front of the

State building?
MR. RENNER:

As the attorneys for the State of

5

Ohio we would certainly want to review all other

6

constitutional provisions and statutes.

7

QUESTION:

And if the Nazi Party did it I guess

8

the legislature wouldn't worry about the Nazi Party

9

display being associated with the State, would it?

10
11
12

13
14

MR. RENNER:

Your Honor, to say that they

wouldn't worry about it would be disingenuous.
QUESTION:

Well, but they have this regulation

that you say permits it.
MR. RENNER:

That's correct.

The regulation

15

would not -- the regulation which we have advised the

16

board to work under would not proscribe forms of speech

17

other than those that violate the Establishment Clause.

18

QUESTION:

Whether it's lawful or not, I find it

19

difficult to believe that the members of the Ohio

20

Legislature wouldn't worry about the Nazi Party being

21

associated with the State.

22

MR. RENNER:

23

QUESTION:

I agree with that, Your Honor.
And if they don't worry about it with

24

the Nazi Party, I don't know why they would worry about it

25

with the KKK or with a cross, or with a religious symbol.

1

It just seems implausible to me that they are really

2

worried about the State being identified with the messages

3

that they're allowing to be put there.

4

worry about it with religion and not with other things?

5

MR. RENNER:

Why would they

Well, I hope that it would be

6

because, Your Honor, that religion has a specific

7

qualification in the First Amendment, and I would hope

8

that the State worries about the things that their

9

attorneys suggest that they worry --

10

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not worried about it

11

whether it's -- it is in the First Amendment, but you also

12

have to establish a risk of identification, and if there's

13

a real risk of identification, I doubt whether the Ohio

14

Legislature would say, anybody with any sort of an

15

unpleasant message can stick it up in front of our

16

Statehouse.

17

identification, I doubt whether they'd do that.

18

If they were really worried about

MR. RENNER:

Your Honor, I think I would agree

19

with your analysis.

20

State did struggle considerably with the notion of

21

allowing the Ku Klux Klan to rally or put up displays at

22

the Statehouse, but they did permit them to rally.

QUESTION:

Mr. Renner, may I ask the other side

24

of the coin from Justice Scalia's question?

Do you

1

there was a case arose in Michigan before this one, to

2

make it necessary for the State to permit the Libertarian

3

Party to put up a sign such as you describe if they want

4

to?
MR. RENNER:

Your Honor.

7
8

I --

QUESTION:

You don't understand the court of --

the rationale of the court of appeals to require that?
MR. RENNER:

9
10

No, I don't understand it that way,

It would require that if in fact

those forums of speeches were allowed to others.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. RENNER:

They said it's an open -I think the State of Ohio could

13

proscribe all unattended displays, but I think once speech

14

is opened up, the only way that the State of Ohio could

15

forbid any speech is if it were a violation of some other

16

constitutional provision.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. RENNER:

19

Well -And that's what we assert is the

problem here in this case.
QUESTION:

20

Wasn't there testimony in the record

21

here from a rabbi that said that a menorah was a religious

22

symbol?

23

MR. RENNER:

There was, Your Honor, and he

24

testified quite vehemently that it was a purely religious

25

symbol, as viewed by members of his faith.

QUESTION:

1

I take it your argument today is that

2

the menorah would have to fall in the same category as the

4

symbol, and yet Ohio itself made the distinction.

Your opening statement was that no religious

5

MR. RENNER:

It is correct, Justice Ginsburg,

6

that Ohio made the distinction, but it was based on

7

directives that Ohio felt had been provided to it by

8

superior courts.
QUESTION:

9

But do I take it from your opening

10

statement at this argument that you have now reconsidered

11

and you -- I thought you said in the beginning of your

12

argument that no religious symbol could be in front of a

13

building that is identified with Government.

14

MR. RENNER:

That is our belief, Justice

15

Ginsburg.

We are still, however, living with a decision

16

that, as we read the Allegheny County case, that says that

17

the menorah is not a purely religious symbol.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. RENNER:

20

QUESTION:

21

Was that an opinion of the Court?
It was in the opinion -Did it command the votes of five

justices?
MR. RENNER:

22

I do not believe that it did, Your

23

Honor.

It was in the opinion of Justice Blackmun, who of

24

course read the opinion for the Court, but I don't believe

25

that section of it did command the five votes.

It is,

1

however, the guidance that the State of Ohio has worked

2

with since it was rendered.
QUESTION:

3

Does your theory ask us to presume

4

what a reasonable observer would conclude?

5

make that as some sort of an empirical inquiry in all of

6

these cases?

7

MR. RENNER:

Do we have to

Justice Kennedy, I don't believe

8

it's necessary.

9

whether we use the analysis of the endorsement test and

10

use the analysis of a reasonable observer, or if we use

11

the analysis of Lee v. Weisman, in which there was an

12

indirect, coercive effect because of the mandatory nature

3

I think that our result is achieved

of subjecting the school students to the prayer.

4

This is very much like that because the

5

placement of this cross will automatically require many

6

thousands of citizens to view this message, the message of

7

the cross superimposed upon the State Capitol building,

8

so - -

asking you if your theory doesn't require us to assume

that a reasonable observer would attribute this message to

MR. RENNER:

I'm saying, Justice Kennedy, I

7

don't think it requires that analysis.

8

that analysis supports the result we urge upon the Court,

9

because we think that a reasonable observer under these

10

circumstances, with a message as powerful as that of an

11

unattended cross in the presence of the State Capitol

your theory even if a reasonable observer would not

attribute this message to the State, the State still is

19

required to suppress it.

20

MR. RENNER:

The answer to that question, I

21

think, Your Honor, lies in the decision of Lee v. Weisman

MR. WOLMAN:

QUESTION:

No, Justice Kennedy.
Why not?

A perfectly valid

regulation can be passed from a number of motives, and it

21

seems to me if the State decides, you know, we're getting

22

a lot of flack from people who see this Klan display up

23

here of the cross, and we're taking heat from it, and we

24

realize we can't just ban the Klan's cross, but we're

25

going to ban everything and just avoid the problem.

We believe that --

MR. WOLMAN:

1

Justice Ginsburg, the State may-

well have limitations on size of any of the displays

3

within the forum, and if it ultimately became necessary,

in order to serve a compelling State interest of

As it was, on the record in this case you had

leaving the door open to a reasonable observer kind of

11

becomes necessary for some special reason, given the

12

extraordinarily immense display as an example, it may be

13

appropriate to have in general time, place, and manner

14

restrictions.
QUESTION:

15

Well, Mr. Wolman, supposing you have

16

not the State Capitol in Columbus, where you have 10

17

acres, but a State Capitol which has a much, much smaller

18

grounds, and they've got some beautiful flowers planted

19

there, and they say, you know, we're not having any

20

displays here at all on these grounds.

21

park across the street that you can go to, but we just

22

don't have any displays, attended or unattended, on these

23

grounds.

24
25

There's a capital

Is that permissible?
MR. WOLMAN:

That's content neutral, and it is

permissible.

QUESTION:

Well then, why can't Ohio return to

But I thought you said they can never

MR. WOLMAN:

If they have a content-neutral reason for not
having the displays there -QUESTION:

What if they just have a content-

neutral rule?
MR. WOLMAN:

13

QUESTION:

15

No, I was speaking of the general

public forum, slightly distinguished from displays.

12

14

It could return to it, if --

Yes.
Why do we have to inquire into their

motive why they have a content-neutral rule?
MR. WOLMAN:

If they do have a content-neutral

16

rule, then, indeed, they could exclude unattended displays

17

from the public forum, for a variety of reasons.

18

it may be that unattended at night creates problems.

19

People might walk into them, lighting, there's all kinds

20

of reasons one can come up with why --

21

QUESTION:

I mean,

No, they're just doing it because

22

they just don't like the KKK thing.

It gets a lot of

23

their citizens mad, and they say, well, if we let

24

everybody else do it, we have to let the KKK do it, and

25

it's not worth it.

We're just not going to have any

unattended displays.

2

MR. WOLMAN:

3

QUESTION:

Can they do that?
No.
On the other hand, if the State is

4

broke, and it says, the only way we can balance the budget

5

is to sell our 10-acre plot for an office building, you'd

6

let them do that, wouldn't you?

7

MR. WOLMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

We would, indeed.
So there's one circumstance in which

they can totally eliminate the public forum and you agree.

10

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WOLMAN:

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolman -That's absolutely correct.
Mr. Wolman -- I hate to interrupt

14

you, but I'd like to ask just a couple of questions, if I

15

may.

16
17
18

You say that this is a religious symbol.

What

is the religion of the Klan?
MR. WOLMAN:

The Klan members hold themselves

19

out in this record as Christians.

20

out as the symbol being not just a symbol of their faith,

21

but a symbol of history, a symbol of history that many of

22

us may find, at the very least, disquieting.

23

They hold themselves

Nonetheless, it reflects a symbol of the

24

Confederate cross, the Scottish clans of the 1300's --

25

it's not just a religious symbol.

It has a variety of

1

meanings, as do most types of symbols.
QUESTION:

2

But I think the argument -- the

3

reason I ask is so much of the argument is based on the

4

assumption that this cross is a religious symbol.

5

there testimony to the effect that it is a religious

6

symbol.

7

MR. WOLMAN:

Now, is

There is testimony as to the mixed

8

purpose, and indeed, not just testimony, but the

9

disclaimer itself specifically recited -- it's at page 12

10

of our brief in chief.

11

said it was to express respect for the holiday season and

12

to in fact test the government of the State of Ohio,

13

challenge them over their discriminatory application,

14

granting the application of the menorah.

15

QUESTION:

The disclaimer itself specifically

Well, if it has a -- and I don't know

16

what the mix is.

17

reasons, and 50 religious, then how does that become a

18

free exercise problem?

19
20

MR. WOLMAN:
is not a problem.

23

Well, we believe that free exercise

We believe that --

QUESTION:

21
22

Let's say, 50-50, 50 whatever other

Well, I mean, it's a problem in this

case.
MR. WOLMAN:

In this case, the State is

24

asserting that the Establishment Clause bans it, and we

25

think they're totally off-base in doing it.

QUESTION:

1

2

Well, now, with that said, what is --

what does a burning cross symbolize?
MR. WOLMAN:

3

A burning cross, I believe, would

4

symbolize the general orientation of the Ku Klux Klan

5

against racial minorities, not just you, ethnic

6

minorities, myself and others, a whole variety of

7

purposes.

8

9

QUESTION:

So there are some people -- as I

understand the record, there were some concerns that some

10

of the citizens of Columbus, when they saw that, could

11

actually see fire on that cross.

12

3

MR. WOLMAN:

Could see fire, you mean

figuratively?

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. WOLMAN:

That's right.
Perhaps some could.

The record

6

here indicates, though, there were no security issues.

7

The judge specifically --

20
21

QUESTION:

But doesn't the record suggest,

though, that there was some concern that people would see
more than the religious symbol in that cross?
MR. WOLMAN:

Yes, I think that's true, and

22

that's a political message, and one very much protected by

23

the Free Speech Clause.

24
25

QUESTION:

But that message doesn't implicate

the Establishment Clause.

MR. WOLMAN:

1

2

We believe not.

The political

message does not.
QUESTION:

3

Do you think that the political --

4

with respect to the cross, that the political message for

5

the Klan overwhelms the religious free exercise

6

considerations, that if someone -- if I said that a member

7

of the Ku Klux Klan is carrying a cross down Pennsylvania

8

Avenue, would the average person, or the reasonable

9

person, think that that, that the Klan is engaged in an

10

exercise of religion, or a political statement?
MR. WOLMAN:

11

My own personal views, but not in

12

the record, are that I would view it as mostly a political

13

statement, but we -- and in fact we believe that the State

14

has used the Establishment Clause as a make-weight in this

15

matter.

16

we think that it has been --

17

QUESTION:

18

So we're shoe-horning a political

case into the religious component of the First Amendment.
MR. WOLMAN:

19
20

The Establishment Clause is not irrelevant, but

We believe the State has done just

that.

21

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

23

The case is submitted.

24

(Whereupon, at 11:13 a.m., the case in the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
