ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. FRIED:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In these two consolidated cases, the Eleventh

11

Circuit overruled its own prior decision in Taylor v.

12

General Motors, an airbags case, to hold that conflict

1.3

preemption may not be implied under the Safety Act.

14

Thereby, it reversed grants of summary judgment in two

15

district courts below and allowed the plaintiffs, the

16

respondents here, to claim that under Georgia tort law it

17

may be claimed to be a design defect for manufacturers not

18

to incorporate antilock devices in their airbrake systems.

19

Though the First, Third, and Tenth Circuits,

20

like the Eleventh Circuit, had held previously that

21

conflict preemption may be implied under the Safety Act,

22

the Eleventh Circuit believed that this Court's decision

23

in Cipollone v. Liggett Group required a different rule

24

because there had been express attention to the subject of

25

preemption in the act, thereby virtually foreclosing any

1

further inquiry into implied or conflict preemption.

2

We believe that is wrong, and that express

3

preemption does not virtually foreclose inquiry into

4

implied preemption.

5

say that section 39 -- 1397 saves inconsistent State law,

6

including tort law.

7

We also believe that it is wrong

to

Before explaining why there is indeed an

8

incompatibility here between allowing a Georgia jury to

9

find a design defect and the Safety Act, I'd like to say

10

just one very brief word about why the Eleventh Circuit

11

rule is surely incorrect.

12

it would compel Congress, every time it legislates, to add

13

a "we mean it" clause, a clause which says, and, of

14

course, we preempt all inconsistent and incompatible State

15

law.

16

Supremacy Clause, nor would it subtract anything from the

17

burdens on this Court, the task of this Court, in

18

determining what State laws are and are not incompatible.

19

If that rule were correct, then

Such a boilerplate clause would add nothing to the

QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, even if we accept your

20

position on that, we have here an express preemption

21

clause, as I understand it, and it preempts State

22

standards applicable to a particular aspect of performance

23

addressed by a Federal standard that is in effect, and as

24

I understand it, there is no Federal standard in effect

25

now on antilock brakes, and how can there be express

preemption?

How do we even get that far?

2

MR. FRIED:

Well, there --

QUESTION:

There just isn't a Federal standard.

4

MR. FRIED:

That is the contention principally

5

urged by the Solicitor General, and we believe that is

6

incorrect.

7

mind was actually cited by respondents' amici ATLA.

8

The case which most compelling is brought to

That's the lisa Petroleum case, in which this
Court said that a preempted inference is not to be drawn

10

by inaction alone, to be sure, but from inaction joined

11

with action, and what I'd like to do is indicate to you

12

that there was in this case both action and inaction, and

13

that those two together in fact constitute a Federal

14

determination that it is dangerous -- not simply

15

unwarranted, but dangerous, or potentially dangerous, to

16

require the incorporation of antilock brakes in - -

17

antilock devices in airbrake systems.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Fried --

1

QUESTION:

Well, if the Federal Government had

20

never had any regulation in effect at all dealing with

21

antilock brakes, would there be any reason to think the

22

express preemption clause is invoked here?

23
24
25

MR. FRIED:

There would not.

That would not,

but that - QUESTION:

MR. FRIED:

No.

We rely on the

history, but

also on the text of the present standard 121.

4

Solicitor General who asks us to read 121 as if the

5

subject of antilock devices had not been addressed, but

that is simply wrong.

addressed in two places in the present standard.

addressed first --

QUESTION:

It's the

The subject is addressed.

It's
It is

Mr. Fried, why shouldn't we accept

10

the administrator's determination of what the status of

11

regulation is?

12

reading is plausible, and they are telling us that the

13

expert administrator says, in effect, there is no Federal

14

standard, why don't we owe that position deference?

15

If your reading is plausible, and their

MR. FRIED:

the administrator is owed deference

16

because of the administrator's expertise.

17

administrator has expertise in safety matters.

18

expertise led the administrator to conclude in 1978 and

19

before, that it is safe and required -- and appropriate to

20

require antilock devices.

21

That judgment was reversed.

The
That

That judgment was

22

rejected by the courts, and certiorari was granted here.

23

I believe that at that point any deference due to the

24

administrator was exhausted.

true, that we only accord deference to agency officials in

2

their areas of expertise.

to an agency officer as to the meaning of that agency's

regulation.

question, what the text of a regulation means.

We certainly accord deference

It has

It's just what the meaning of

MR. FRIED:

Well --

10

QUESTION:

We accord deference.

11

MR. FRIED:

On that, let's turn to the meaning

12

of the regulation, because there is -- if there is

13

deference to be paid, I think that deference cannot carry

14

all the way to the conclusion which respondents and the

15

Solicitor General seek, because in this case there was a

16

federally mandated process, and the outcome of that

17

process was the removal, and that removal is textual.

18

It's not just a hole.

It's not just like the air in the

19

souffle.

It's on page -- I don't have the

page,

but it's S3 of the regulation.

It says --

Where do we find that?

not -- it was subsequently lodged with the Court to - -

QUESTION:

9

I still don't quite understand,

Mr. Fried, just following up with -- you were interrupted

10

on - - you were going to quote something that was in

11

writing that was in place now, that preempts the State --

12

MR. FRIED:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. FRIED:

Yes, Your Honor.
Is that what you just referred to?
No.

I'm going to refer to another

15

provision as well, which I'm frank to say we didn't focus

16

on until late in the game, but the respondents cite it on

17

page 9, footnote 8 of their briefs, and that is Standard

18

S5.5.1 on page 383 of the lodging.

19

Now, that standard --

MR. FRIED:

That is footnote 8 on page 9 of the

That is correct.

That is correct.

23

I hope I've got the -- yes, that's right.

S5.5.1, and what that standard says is that if you are

going to put antilock devices in your airbrake systems,

That refers to

then they may not degrade the total performance of the

system.

3

QUESTION:

I find this quite unsatisfactory,

4

Mr. Fried, that things that seem to be at the core of the

5

case were either lodged or are in the footnote in someone

6

else's brief.

9

MR. FRIED:

I wish it had been otherwise,

Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Is it your position, Mr. Fried, that

10

if a truck had airbrakes on it, and there was an accident,

11

that the Federal standard could be used or argued to a

12

jury as evidence that it was unsafe?

13

MR. FRIED:

It could be used if it violated

14

5.5.1 as set out by the respondents.

15

the device - -

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. FRIED:

18
19

That is to say, if

Well, suppose it didn't?
Oh, if it did not, then that, too,

would be preempted.
Just like Georgia cannot say it is a design

20

defect not to incorporate antilock devices, even though

21

the basis of the Federal determination was that it is

22

dangerous to have such a requirement, so Florida, let's

23

say, to give an example, could not say it is a design

24

defect for manufacturers to incorporate properly

25

functioning antilock devices which nevertheless, because

1

of driver error or maintenance problems, which are the two

2

things that plague these devices, has led to an accident.

3

Either way - -

4

QUESTION:

But it seems to me that indicates

5

there's an absence of a safety standard.

6

that there is preemption if there is a safety standard in

7

place, but this is an absence of a standard.
MR. FRIED:

8

9

The act requires

There is -- Standard 121,

altogether, is a comprehensive design and performance

10

standard.

11

many elements of design, and altogether it says what

12

constitutes minimally acceptable airbrake systems.

13

It is not just a performance standard.

QUESTION:

It has

Well, it is with respect to airbrake

14

systems, but it's not comprehensive with respect to the

15

vehicles upon which an airbrake system may be installed.

16

There's nothing comprehensive -- it is expressly

17

noncomprehensive with respect to them, and it seems to me

18

that's the point that we have to focus on.
MR. FRIED:

19
20

an airbrake system.

21

system.

22

An antilock device becomes part of
It is integral to the airbrake

It isn't -QUESTION:

Well, it may do so, but the only word

23

from the National Government with respect to them, by the

24

National Government's own text, does not apply to trucks

25

and trailers.

1

I will stipulate to the comprehensiveness of the

2

regulation with respect to those vehicles that it has

3

application to, but the point that seems to be dispositive

4

to me is, it doesn't apply to these vehicles, therefore

5

there can't be express preemption, and I would suppose, a

6

fortiori, there can't be implied preemption.

7

MR. FRIED:

Oh, the difficulties that are being

8

raised apply as well to implied preemption, that is

9

correct, but what one has to do is consider what the

10
11

Federal Government has done and why it has done it.
QUESTION:

No, but no matter how comprehensive

12

the regulation may be with respect to those vehicles that

13

it covers, it is neither comprehensive nor even, if you

14

will, in existence with respect to those vehicles that it

15

does not cover, so I'm missing your point here.

16

see the relevance of arguing the comprehensiveness of what

17

it says when it applies to the question of whether it

18

applies to these trucks and trailers, which by its express

19

terms, it does not.

20

MR. FRIED:

I don't

Well, it does apply to all trucks

21

and trailers, including those that incorporate antilock

22

devices, because those antilock devices cannot, if they're

23

functioning properly, bring -- the malfunctions in them,

24

rather than maintenance and driver mistakes, cannot bring

25

the performance of the rest of the system below the

prescribed minimum.

2

QUESTION:

3

amendment.

4

So it addresses that.
But I'm focusing on the text of the

What was the text of the amendment?
MR. FRIED:

Well, the provision I've been citing

5

to you is in the standard as it is now in operation, and

6

the amendment withdrew the requirement of having that

7

device in all airbrakes.
Now, it seems to me important to ask, why did it

8

9

withdraw that requirement, if the reason it was withdrawn

10

has to do with the safety concerns of the act, not a

11

concern for uniformity, not a concern simply that the

12

agency hadn't done it's knitting right, hadn't produced

13

the right evidence, but because the record compelled the

14

conclusion that this requirement, as a requirement, is

15

dangerous.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, suppose one were to read

17

this as the agency's responding not to its own better

18

judgment, but to the compulsion of the Ninth Circuit?

19

Forgetting about the deference point that I

20

raised earlier, why isn't the most reasonable reading of

21

what happened here is that the agency is now in the

22

position of saying, well, we're not yet ready to

23

promulgate a final rule on this point because the Ninth

24

Circuit says we have to do a little more work?

25

Why isn't that the most reasonable reading, that

1

they have suspended their judgment.

2

judgment that this is unsafe, or that there should be an

3

option, as they made in the case of the airbag/seatbelt

4

regulation?

5

MR. FRIED:

They have not made a

Justice Ginsburg, you're quite

6

right, the agency did not in its heart of hearts,

7

expressed in its own news releases, accept the Ninth

8

Circuit's determination.

They said, the administrator

said, we still think we're right, but the Ninth Circuit
10

said that this thing which you still think is right is not

11

just unwarranted, it is dangerous.
QUESTION:

12

13

Well, let me get to Justice

Ginsburg's point in just a slightly different way.

14

Suppose the agency said, we do not --we have

15

concluded, after looking at the Ninth Circuit opinion,

16

that we do not have sufficient information to rule on this

17

one way or the other.

18

regulation is rescinded, the distance regulation is

1

rescinded for trucks, and we are going to study the matter

20

further.

The matter -- the estopping

21

Would that be preemptive of the Georgia rule?

22

MR. FRIED:

It would be because the premise was

23

not -- and this is what I have to keep coming back to.

24

the premise of the Ninth Circuit's decision was not,

25

"Look, you don't have a sufficient basis for imposing this
13

1

requirement," rather, they went further.

2

"Imposing this requirement is dangerous."

3

If they had said, imposing --

4

QUESTION:

They say,

But it seems to me is what we're

5

interested in is what the agency has done, not what the

6

Ninth Circuit has said, and if the agency, in my

7

hypothetical, has said,

8

further, we do not have information at this time

"We wish to study the matter

sufficient to make up our mind one way or the other," I
10

find it very difficult to see that that is a safety

11

standard that preempts the Georgia rule, and it seems to

12

me that that is very close to what we have and what

13

Justice Ginsburg was getting at in her question.

14

MR. FRIED:

Again, that formulation assumes that

15

the decision forced on a reluctant agency was a decision

16

that what you've done here is simply not sufficiently

17

justified, rather than a decision which was at the heart

18

of the safety concerns -- that is to say, what you have

1

done here is dangerous, and the agency, of course, has had

20

the matter under continual review ever since.

21

Congress has urged it, in both 1 88 and 1
In 1

1, to

22

hurry up its review.

2, they issued a notice of

23

proposed rulemaking, but the agency record and the agency

24

materials which are cited in our brief over and over again

25

state that there are still grave problems about these

1

devices, and these problems are not the problems of cost.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. FRIED:

But that's not a standard.
What is a standard is 121 as a

4

whole, and 121 as a whole tells you what are minimally

5

safe airbrake systems, and those minimally safe airbrake

6

systems do not, cannot be compelled to include antilock

7

devices because it is dangerous.

8

the standard is at this moment.
QUESTION:

9

That is our view of what

You're saying it's just as clear as

10

if it in so many words said, you may not use antilock

11

brakes.
MR. FRIED:

12

13

Oh, no, they do say you may use

them.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FRIED:

Oh.
You may use them if, when properly

16

functioning, they don't degrade the rest of the system.

17

You may use them.

18

There are three kinds of problems that were

19

experienced with the antilock devices.

20

electrical failures.

21

and the radar would cause this device, which is an

22

electrical device, to put on the antilock brake when you

23

don't want it, or perhaps to remove it.

24
25

One problem was

For instance, you'd pass a radar,

The second kind of failure was maintenance
problems.

The third was driver reactions, the same

withdraw notice of proposed rulemaking on automobile

If you could show that they would

that they do all have that consequence.
QUESTION:

Well, if you can't say that, then you

11

cannot say that this regulation in effect prohibits the

12

use of antilock brakes.

MR. FRIED:

I mentioned the three kinds of

14

difficulties, because 5.5.1 addresses only the first.

maintenance problems and the driver response problems,

which are grave, and which the agency in its technical

reports continuously refers to, those persist, and when I

answered Justice --

21

Yes, but if you have the driver

response problem, wouldn't that apply to any system?

No.

there will be a system design such that drivers will

respond properly.

But Mr. Fried, you concede that if

11

of the part of 121 that the Ninth Circuit rejected, if all

we ever had was that, and the agency never made it a rule,

13

then there would be no argument about preemption, that the

States could have their tort law?

MR. FRIED:

They would not, because there would

Ninth Circuit said it would be unlawful because it's

dangerous to require this, and the agency reluctantly, to

be sure, respected that judgment.

It had no choice.

So I say yes, it is the agency to which we
point, a reluctant agency, but the agency nonetheless.
QUESTION:

6

Well, but the agency just -- when you

say respected it, just did the act that it required, but

8

not for the reason that it stated, and it seems to me that

it's important to your case to establish not just that the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL H. GOTTESMAN

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

17
18
19

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
It may be well to recall what this lawsuit in

20

Georgia alleges.

It alleges that these two trucks, the

21

trucks that -- one truck that killed Mrs. Lindsey, the

22

other that maimed Mr. Myrick, these two trucks were not

23

designed as safely as they might have been, and it alleges

24

that by the time these two trucks were manufactured, which

25

was many, many years after the record that the Ninth

1

Circuit was reviewing, 7 years in the case of one truck

2

and 12 years in the case of the other, that at that time

3

there were available safe antilock brakes, and that those

4

brakes would have been safer than the brake system that

5

was chosen.
Now, at the core of this case, and I think it is

6

7

reflected by the discussion so far, is the question of

8

whether there is any Federal determination with which this
lawsuit, if it were won by the plaintiffs, would conflict,

10

and recall, the plaintiffs haven't won this lawsuit yet.

11

They are going to have to prove that in fact by 1 82 or

12

1 87 there were, in fact, safety devices that would have

13

made this truck safer with an antilock device.

14

So the preemption issue has to be considered on

15

the hypothesis that such evidence could be presented.

16

it's not, the Georgia courts are obviously not going to

17

find for the plaintiffs, and so we focus on that question

18

first.

1

If

Now, the jumping off point is a proposition that

20

all the parties here, including the United States, agree

21

on, and I'll give you the petitioner's formulation of that

22

point, because I think it's one that we all agree on.

23

Conflict preemption could not exist, of course, where

24

there was no Federal determination on the specific

25

subject, so that's the petitioner's formulation of what's

involved here.
And so the question we have is whether there is

a Federal determination on the specific subject of whether

specific judgment.

6

the agency said, you must have them, because we believe

they are safer.

in effect, this lawsuit would not be preempted.

9

be entirely consistent with the Federal regulation.

Obviously, the initial regulation by

11

that isn't the question that we granted certiorari on.

12

express preemption, there can also be implied preemption.

14

Is it your position that this is one of those anterior

questions that has to first be decided before we get to

that?

MR. GOTTESMAN:

22

of that, demonstrate that there is a conflict.

23

First of all, the question presented necessarily

In the brief in opposition at page 26, we

1

made on that point was made actually more broadly in the

2

brief in opposition.

3

"Respondent's Common Law Claims Do Not Conflict With the

4

Safety Act, Nor With Standard 121," and on page 26, the

5

precise point that we're making here is made.

6

Beginning on page 21 is the caption,

That is, that the present status of the Federal

7

regulations is that they don't preclude antilock brakes,

8

but they impose no requirement one way or the other, that

9

in that context, there is no conflict if Georgia says

10

well, we encourage you, or at least we will award tort

11

damages against you, if you don't have them.

12

So the issue is properly preserved.

It is a

13

ground that would sustain the decision below, and I think

14

really this point is also the point that goes to the

15

question of express preemption.

16

really the same, and that is, whether there is, in fact, a

17

conflict between what the State is doing and what the

18

Federal regulations say.

19

effect that would be -- would comprehend the point that

20

the Georgia courts are being asked to decide in this case?

I think the two are

And the regulation as it presently stands says

22

that as to the aspects of performance which are involved

distance at a certain speed, and the ability to do so

25

without jackknifing or skidding, what is sometimes called

1

vehicle stability, as to those aspects, those were dealt

2

with in the original regulation, and each of the

3

provisions that dealt with those aspects of performance is

4

now declared not to be applicable to trucks and trailers,

5

so the present state of the regulatory record is that

6

there is no regulation that deals with those aspects of

7

performance of trucks, the ones which the Ninth Circuit

8

said effectively required antilock brakes.

9

Now, the petitioners say, well, but that gives

10

us an option.

Well, of course it does.

Whenever there's

11

no regulation in effect, they -- the Government has chosen

12

not to regulate something, they enjoy the options that all

13

citizens do, to do whatever is not regulated, but that

14

hardly constitutes a Federal interest that Congress would

15

have wanted to preempt, or that it did preempt on the face

16

of this statute.

17

Now, petitioner's argument ultimately depends on

18

its trying to infuse the statement, there is no regulation

19

applicable to trucks and trailers, with the Ninth

20

Circuit's reasons for requiring that they suspend their

21

earlier regulation.

22

Now, the first proposition, of course, is that

23

the Ninth Circuit doesn't have the power to preempt, only

24

the agency does, and the agency has said there's no

25

regulation in effect applicable to trucks and trailers,

1

but the second point is, this is an overreading in any

2

event of what the Ninth Circuit said.

3

The Ninth Circuit said that it was convinced

4

from the record that antilock brakes promised greater

5

safety in trucks, and it said to a large degree, these

6

devices were already perfected.

7

some trucks, a substantial number, for which it was a

8

potential hazard, and it said the reason this regulation,

9

which required all trucks to have safety devices, was --

It said, but there were

11

between those on which it was safe and those that were

12

You can't have a regulation, said the Ninth

Circuit, requiring that all trucks have antilock brakes if

15

some trucks would be potentially dangerous.

1

1975, long before these trucks were manufactured.
Now, our lawsuit is not seeking a determination

2

3

that all trucks must have antilocks.

4

that these two trucks would have been safer if they had

5

antilocks.

Our lawsuit contends

We have to prove that.
What the Ninth Circuit said is not at all

6

7

inconsistent with our proving that.

8

recognized even then that many trucks would be safe with

9

antilocks.

First of all, they

Secondly, this is 7 and 12 years later, and as

10

everybody's briefs point out, there has been what is

11

called a second generation of antilock devices which are

12

saf e.

13

There has been a huge increase in the actual

14

usage by manufacturers of antilock devices, even though

15

they're not required to do so by the present regulation,

16

and so nothing in the Ninth Circuit, even if you were to

17

read the Ninth Circuit opinion as though it, in heightened

18

verbal, appeared here as an explanation for the withdrawal

19

of the regulation.

20

That would suggest nothing that says the Ninth

21

Circuit has any disposition not to recognize this lawsuit,

22

or to find it inconsistent with the Federal interest, and,

23

of course, the interested agencies are here.

There's no

express preemption, there's no implied preemption in this

case, because there is no Federal interest with which this

collides, and there is no regulation on this aspect of

We withdrew it.

Now, petitioner says, but there's some other

provision that says, if you choose antilock brakes, then

7

you must have them conform electrically to what's

8

required, so they say, see, there is some regulation of

antilock brakes in this case.

doesn't say, if they regulate that item of equipment the

States can't act.

the State can't act, and in this case, the item of

Now, we have not yet gotten to the question of

18

whether the savings clause would in any event sustain this

19

lawsuit even if there were some conflict, but we do want

20

to point out to the Court that the savings clause in this

21

case, by its terms, professed to save any common law

22

liability that manufacturers had.

legislative history that accompanies that confirms what it

says.

Well, so if there were a Federal

2

performance standard applicable here, is it your position

3

that the savings clause would still preserve this cause of

action?

5
6

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, we have three -- yes.

We

have -- well, if there were one applicable to this.

7

We have two points.

First, this -- the tort

8

lawsuit is not a safety standard within the meaning of the

9

preemption clause.

That's confirmed by the savings

10

clause.

11

we know that's not what they meant by a safety standard, a

12

tort judgment.

13

That is, with the benefit of the savings clause,

But beyond that, we do have the savings clause

14

itself which was put in there, and this is not like the

15

Morales case, or the American Airlines case, where you

16

were dealing with a statute that had had a savings clause

17

way back when, when regulating airlines was the vogue, and

18

Congress said, not only are we going to regulate it, but

19

we want not to interfere with any State regulation of

20

airlines, but then 20 years later, Congress came along and

21

said, now we want to deregulate the airlines, and so we

22

want to make it quite clear, we are now going to preempt

23

State regulation, and those unhappy with that reached back

24

to that earlier savings clause, which was not focused

25

specifically on common law lawsuits.

there may be no antilock braking system on a truck,

them from any common law liability, any common law

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q. WOLFSON

9

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

10
11

12

13

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On the implied preemption point, the Department

14

of Transportation, the NHTSA, perceives no conflict

15

between its own lack of regulation of antilock brakes, and

16

the Georgia tort law that is relied on by respondents, and

17

NHTSA does not construe its own Federal safety standards

18

either in this case or generally as conferring this

19

federally protected immunity from State tort judgments.

20

On the express preemption case, NHTSA believes

21

that, first, Congress did not intend the preemption clause

22

of the saving act -- of the Safety Act to reach tort

23

liability and, second, that even if tort suits are

24

covered, that Georgia law would not be preempted in this

25

case because the law would not relate to an aspect of

1

performance of the standard, covered by a standard that is

2

in effect.

3

Section 13 7(k) makes clear that Congress did

4

not intend the Safety Act's preemption clause to reach

5

common law liability.

6

specifically to preclude the argument that compliance with

7

Federal standards would provide a defense as a matter of

8

Federal law to State common law liability, but that is

Congress enacted that saving clause

essentially what the petitioners are asking for here,
10

albeit in the guise of preemption, and Congress did draw a

11

distinction between the State-imposed prescriptive

12

standards, which were preempted, and the State-imposed

13

tort liability, which was not.

14

That is the best explanation for the enactment

15

of the saving clause, and really, petitioners have offered

16

no alternative explanation for why Congress would have

17

enacted it, or any alternative interpretation of the

18

saving clause.

1

There is also what we conceive to be the

20

narrower ground for why Georgia tort law would not be

21

preempted in this case expressly, and that is, even the

22

preemption clause applies only when there's a Federal

23

standard in effect and when the State standard governs by

24

the same aspect of performance that is regulated by that

25

Federal standard.

1

NHTSA does not have, in effect, any safety

2

standard that either requires or prohibits the

3

installation of antilock brakes in trucks, and it also

4

does not have in effect any Federal standard that does the

5

same thing indirectly, as was originally conceived, such

6

as by regulating stopping distances or vehicle stability

7

requirements in trucks.

8

9

The petitioners' argument, which is essentially
that what NHTSA has left unregulated is a form of

10

regulation, is really quite inconsistent with the way that

11

NHTSA perceives its role under the Safety Act.

12

function under the Safety Act is to set minimum standards

13

of performance, and generally speaking the regulatory

14

scheme does not provide that anything that is not

15

regulated is regulated, that there is this federally

16

protected option to avoid further State regulation or

17

State liability.

18

NHTSA's

In this particular case, in the area of antilock

19

brakes, this is simply an area that, as of now, NHTSA has

20

left unregulated, and until it does step in, the States

21

are free to fill that regulatory gap either by

22

prescriptive standards or by an enactment of State - - or

23

by the implementation of State tort liability, which is

24

what the respondents are asking for here.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. FRIED:

Mr. Chief Justice, it is entirely

10

correct that we sort certiorari in this Court on the

11

Eleventh Circuit's rule about implied preemption and that

12

was the only matter as to which there was a conflict

13

between the circuits.

14

Now, the brief in opposition raises the "no

15

conflict" point -- that is to say, no conflict with the

16

Federal determination -- on page 26 simply by a casual --

17

or I - - drop the casual, simply by the statement that

18

since the Federal regulations did not forbid antilock

19

devices, there can be no conflict.

20

Of course, that's not our position.

It was not

21

the position of the dissenting judge, it was not the

22

position of the court of appeals, which found there was a

23

conflict, or the district courts.

Nevertheless, this is not a case like the one
you handed down yesterday.

2

3

to the no-conflict point if it chooses.

4

It's

Now, it's important to see that the courts, the

5

three courts below did decide this in terms of implied

6

preemption, and did indeed find a conflict.

7

The implied preemption perhaps has some more

8

force to it than the express preemption, because the

9

conflict is with what we insist is a total Federal

10

determination, and that is how this Court had looked at

11

the lisa Petroleum case although reaching a difference

12

conclusion, but by language, which supports us and the

13

Atlantic Richfield case, which we cite in our brief, as

14

well.

15

Finally, I should point out that it's not quite

16

accurate to say that NHTSA has said we're not ready yet,

not quite yet, but everybody has these.

they could comply until then with 5.5.1, and what's

23

important to see is that NHTSA has continuously, at the

24

highest levels, sought to impose this requirement and
