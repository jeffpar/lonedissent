ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

14

MR. GARELIS:

Thank you.

Mr. Garelis.

Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:
California is seeking review of the summary

15

affirmance by the Ninth Circuit of an order granting a

16

preliminary injunction.

17

district court in this matter.

18

to reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remand

19

this case with instructions that the preliminary

20

injunction be dissolved.

QUESTION:

MR. GARELIS:

QUESTION:

That order was made by the
California asks this Court

Would that make any difference?
Yes, it would.

What would you do if the injunction

MR. GARELIS:

1

At the moment, Your Honor, we

2

could not do so.

As noted in our brief, California is

3

restricted from implementing the statute until a Federal

4

waiver, which was invalidated by the Ninth Circuit in a

5

related Ninth Circuit case, is restored.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GARELIS:

8

Why is that, Mr. Garelis?
Because State law, the statute

here in question, absolutely requires, by its own terms,
that California have that waiver.
QUESTION:

11

have the waiver.

Well, I realize it says it has to

I'm looking on page 3 of your brief --

12

MR. GARELIS:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- which sets forth -- it says, this

14

section shall not become operative until the date of

15

approval by the United States Secretary of HHS.

16

at one time the Secretary did approve --

17

MR. GARELIS:

18

QUESTION:

1

I take it

Yes, Your Honor, the Secretary --

-- and so the thing became operative

then.

20

MR. GARELIS:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, it did.

Well, the statute doesn't say

22

anything about becoming nonoperative if the approval is

23

revoked, does it?

is true, but we hav always -4

QUESTION:

1

Has it been construed by the

2

California courts on that point?

3

MR. GARELIS:

4

we've always taken that position.

5

QUESTION:

No, I do not believe it has, but

Isn't Federal law relevant, too?

6

mean, you couldn't put -- could you put this law into

7

effect without the Federal approval, as a matter of

8

Federal law?
MR. GARELIS:

10

13

As a matter of Federal law, yes,

we could.
QUESTION:

11
12

You'd just lose a lot of Federal

money.
MR. GARELIS:

If the operative actions were

14

taken by the Secretary of Health & Human Services to

15

restrict our funding on California's Medi-Cal program,

16

yes, that's --

17
18

QUESTION:

Would California put a law, this law

into effect without the matching Federal dollars?

1

MR. GARELIS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. GARELIS:

Yes, it could.

It could, theoretically?
It could theoretically, but it

22

would run the risk of losing a good deal of Federal

23

matching funds.

QUESTION:

But your submission to us is that you

would not implement it without the waiver?

1

MR. GARELIS:

No, we would not --we have always

2

interpreted this section as a mandate by the California

3

legislature that we would not implement this particular

4

statute without the waiver.

5
6

7

QUESTION:

Have you applied for the, or

reapplied for the waiver?
MR. GARELIS:

Yes, we have.

I believe it was on

8

August 25th my client submitted an augmented waiver

9

request to the Secretary of Health & Human Services.

10

QUESTION:

Is there some indication that the

11

Department has denied waivers submitted from other States

12

that contain this provision?

13
14
15

MR. GARELIS:

I believe the Secretary has done

that recently, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

If the cases had come up in a

16

different order -- suppose you had been -- the Beno case

17

had come up first, so you -- the Federal permission was

18

not there, and then these plaintiffs, the Green

19

plaintiffs, had begun this lawsuit, wouldn't you be taking

20

the position that their lawsuit was premature because you

21

in effect had no law in effect?

22

MR. GARELIS:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, we would.

So isn't that really where we are

24

now, that this suit has in effect not become moot, but

25

become not ripe?

MR. GARELIS:

No, I don't believe so, Your

Honor, because the case -- the questions here are
persistent.

The case in - - the questions of

constitutional validity of our statute are certainly -QUESTION:

But if you say that you don't have

any law in force at the moment other than the old law
under which the newcomer gets the full benefits, then
you're asking us to decide a hypothetical case about a law
that is not yet in being.
MR. GARELIS:

Well, the law was -- the approval

of the waiver was obtained.

The statute did come into

effect.
The statute was then -- the district court by
means of the preliminary injunction refused to allow us to
implement the statute, then the next year -- and that was
all in 1993, in 199 -- in late '92, excuse me, and then in
early '94, earlier this year, while we were still in the
process of appealing the preliminary injunction to the
Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit in the Beno case did,
indeed, take away the waiver.
It invalidated the Federal waiver, and what that
did was under State law made it so that, once the
constitutionality of this statute is settled in the -California's favor, then we - - until we get the waiver
back, we could not enforce the statute.

QUESTION:

And in effect you have no law of the

2

kind that the plaintiff is challenging.

3

in California now is the law that you pay full benefits.

4

MR. GARELIS:

The law in force

Well, we did have the approval,

5

and as soon as we get the waiver back we would be able to

6

implement it, but it is true at the moment we would --

7

QUESTION:

And is there any reasonable basis to

8

predict that you'll get it back when the Federal

9

Government has turned down such applications by other

10
11

States with the identical law?
MR. GARELIS:

Well, perhaps one of the reasons

12

why the Secretary has turned down such waivers is because

13

of lack of guidance from this Court that our statute

14

should, indeed, survive a constitutional challenge.

MR. GARELIS:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, that is true.

If you get your approval back,

4

there's no risk of there being an evasion of review on the

5

analogy with the mootness flaw, is there?
MR. GARELIS:

arguing is that this is a continuing question.
QUESTION:

No, but this is -- what we're

Well, it may be a continuing

question, but right -- but it is not a continuous question

right at the moment.

and if it does become a real one again, it can be reviewed

then, can it not?

It seemingly is not a practical one,

There's no risk of evasion of review.

MR. GARELIS:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

Is there an indication in the

administrative record that the reason the agency has

4

denied the waiver is because of its interpretation of the

constitutional minimum standards that it has required, or

is it also plausible to surmise,

MR. GARELIS:

And so the Secretary didn't have

MR. GARELIS:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

Many decisions are made on

preliminary injunction.

4

California is saying still in that proceeding, by the way,

5

the Secretary did have adequate notice and comment, and we

insist that this matter still be litigated, and we're

going to appeal it again.

10

MR. GARELIS:

What I want to know is whether

Well, we're going to have to wait

and see what the Secretary's resolution is, and we have no
other plans of litigating except for that.

11

California statute is a benefit reduction

12

statute, and therefore California submits that the

13

constitutionality of the statute should therefore be

■S,

14

determined as with any other benefit reduction statute,

^

15

that is, by rational basis, because our statute does not

16

impact either a suspect class, does not penalize a

17

fundamental right, therefore the proper analysis is the

18

rational basis.

19

Here at issue the benefit reduction statute is

20

implemented by a two-tier system of payment levels.

21

Court has previously approved two-tier systems in the

22

context of domestic relations, and it has certainly

23

approved them in the context of out-of-State tuition

24

differentials.

Furthermore, even the Shapiro case acknowledges

A benefit reduction is not necessarily limiting

your result in Dandridge would be inexplicable.

If your theory is right, how long

could California maintain this differential?

QUESTION:

-- that has higher taxes, then you

MR. GARELIS:

We believe California could do so

with a rational basis, and we believe that that statute

would be adjudicated under the rational basis standard.

12

QUESTION:

Why isn't the right to travel

implicated here?
MR. GARELIS:

The right to travel is not

13

implicated to the extent necessary to become a penalty,

14

because the statute is very carefully drafted to maintain

15

the recipient's level of receipt of benefits.

17

QUESTION:

Is it possible that the cost of

living is higher in California than, let's say, Louisiana?

That may be, but --

Does California's scheme make any

adjustment for the higher cost of living?

21

MR. GARELIS:

No, it does not.

Well, so in a very real sense the new

10

Well, but for purposes of knowing

11

whether there's a violation of any constitutional

protection given to the right to travel and establish a

14

kind of an inquiry.

MR. GARELIS:

Well, when a person comes from a

noted in Zobel, as in Viandis, the reason for making a

2

student wait a year to get the benefits of in-State

3

tuition is that a student is likely to be

4

characteristically transient in a way that no welfare

5

recipient is.

6

A student, unlike a welfare recipient, is likely

7

to come to a State, take the benefit of the low-cost

8

public education, without an intention to remain

9

indefinitely.

10
11

Bona fide residence turns on an intention

to stay in the State to which one has migrated.
QUESTION:

Well, could a State set up any sort

12

of a time limit and say that you don't become a bona

14

you've at least been here 30 days.

MS. SULLIVAN:

Yes, it could, Your Honor.

16

States have latitude to set up the terms for bona fide

17

residency, but as the Court --

QUESTION:

MS. SULLIVAN:

A year is too long, in your view?
A year is generally too long,

20

unless there is special reason to fear that a certain

21

population is going to come into the State on a transient

22

basis to procure a benefit from that State and then leave.

23

That, after all, was the justification in Sosner for

24

upholding the durational residency requirement for someone

seeking a divorce.

1

Am I supposed to take judicial notice

2

that students are more apt to move than welfare

3

recipients?

I mean, how do I know that?

MS. SULLIVAN:

4

Your Honor, welfare recipients

5

are unlike students or divorce-seekers for several

6

reasons.

7

recipients in this case are bona fide residents of

8

California, and with good reason, because California

First, the State here concedes that all the AFDC

investigates the bona fides of residents in order to
10

determine whether these persons are eligible for welfare

11

in the first instance.

12

As Justice Scalia suggested for the Court in

13

Smith v. Employment Services, this is a case in which

14

there is already in place a procedure in-State for

15

individualized determinations of eligibility.

16

QUESTION:

So I take it at no point in the

17

litigation has the State raised this -- a challenge to the

18

bona fides of the residents?

MS. SULLIVAN:

That is correct, Justice Souter.

20

Bona fide residence is not at issue in this case.

State and procure and then leave with, such as the degree

2

In your view, Ms. Sullivan, is there

some Federal rule that determines how we find out whether

someone is a bona fide resident?

5

MS. SULLIVAN:

No, Your Honor.

What we

suggest -- that is a matter of State law.

What we are

7

suggesting here is that bona fide residency cannot be a

justification in this case.

9

State citizens differently, which is a presumptive

violation of the Constitution.
QUESTION:

12

What about the State using -- I

13

understand that we have a general rule about freedom of

travel, and a State cannot penalize people for moving into

the State, but it seems to me entirely reasonable for a

16

State to object, if it wants -- especially a State that

17

wants to have a generous welfare program, to want to

18

preserve the funds that it's expending in that program by

19

not becoming an attraction to people who move to that

State for no reason except to get the increased welfare.
It seems to me so reasonable to say, we're being

21

22

very generous, more generous than most States, but our

23

system will self-destruct if it attracts people from other

24

States.

25

Why shouldn't we make that kind of an exception?
And that's what they're trying to do here.

The justification is, we don't want to attract welfare

MS. SULLIVAN:

Justice Scalia, if that is the

unconstitutional and unreasonable.

QUESTION:

That is a --

I knew you were going to say that.

MS. SULLIVAN:

11

Let me explain why.

First, that

is an impermissible end.

13

facial discrimination against new State citizens.

14

The mechanism here is de jure

Of course a State may hoard some of its State-

15

created resources as against nonresidents of the State,

16

those who - - the very definition of State sovereignty

17

entails that a State may reserve its resources for its own

18

people, but when someone crosses the border into the State

19

and becomes a citizen of that State, the State may not say

20

to that person, we will now treat you as a second-class

21

citizen.

22

Imagine that a State were to say, well, you've

23

moved from Massachusetts to New Hampshire, New Hampshire

24

doesn't have an income tax, but New Hampshire's going to

25

take your money at the Massachusetts rate.

We're arguing here that where there is facial de

Well, what if California in this

Well, why isn't it reasonable to

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, there is absolutely

no evidence in the record that California's relatively

8

higher grant levels attract poor people at higher rates

than they would be attracted otherwise by the prosperity

10

or other features of the State, but even if that were so,

11

you have in the past consistently said that a State may

12

not make itself attractive to insiders but discriminate

13

against newcomers in order to keep an influx of newcomers

from coming into the State.

You said it in Shapiro, you said it in

that line of precedent and say now, for the first time,

that if someone crosses State lines in order to use a

tailored, or even remotely tailored to that goal.
This statute, if it's trying to fence out those

or it still must be logically related to its distinctions.

22

That is, you have said in Heller v. Doe that a

statute need not be empirically proven by the State to

rest on a rational basis, but surely it remains the case

that it must logically relate to the distinction it draws,

and there is no logical relationship between the first 12

months of residency and welfare-seeking.

3

This statute applies even if one comes to

4

California to start a job, comes, starts working, works

5

for 8 months, and loses one's job, and suddenly and

6

unexpectedly needs to seek AFDC benefits.

7

QUESTION:

Well, that's true if you look at it

8

on a purely individualized basis, but there is a rational

9

argument, I suppose, to the effect that California or any

10

State simply cannot afford to provide a generous welfare

11

scheme if the magnet is going to be so great that there

12

are going to be a lot of short-term "transients" taking

13

advantage of it - - I use transient in quotes -- so that in

14

fact the only hope for raising the level for everybody is

15

to do it under circumstances in which the short-term

attraction is going to be mitigated, otherwise, nobody can

afford it.

MS. SULLIVAN:

Justice Souter, if you were

starting at square one and ignoring the admonition in

10

Shapiro that the goal to fence out needy people is an

11

impermissible one, the statute would still not be

12

logically tailored to that goal.

13

And the reason is that California is able,

14

through its existing individualized investigations of

15

welfare eligibility, to determine, if it wished to, what

16

are the reasons that people come to California.

17

And if it wished to fence out those who have

come not to escape being battered, as did the named

California could screen those people out with no

additional expense beyond what it is already incurring

that - QUESTION:

6

You don't concede that that would be

MS. SULLIVAN:

Not at all, Your Honor.

We do

not concede that would be constitutional, because we think

10

if States can begin to investigate the motives people move

11

in-State, whether it's for better schools or lower taxes

12

or a better way of life --

13

QUESTION:

But then we're slipping away from the

14

argument about whether or not this isn't, leaving

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, as Justice Breyer

12

pointed out before, that argument is scarcely credible in

by reducing benefits 76 cents across the board.

This is

If it were the case that the States were unable

to offer generous benefits without encouraging an influx

of indigents, Congress could remedy the problem by setting

For example, it might

develop the attachment and loyalty that high office

requires, and there may be other instances which we don't

14

But the point in this case is that there is no

good reason for the distinction California has drawn here.

16

Either, as Justice Scalia suggests, the real reason is to

There is no such showing in this

I would point out also the State has argued here

that somehow its ability to experiment with welfare

review you don't tie the hands of the State in solving its

economic problems.

9

Well, with respect, an affirmance in this case

10

will in no way tie the hands of the State to engage in

11

every sort of experiment in welfare reform, be it time

limits, or work incentives, or any other distinction among

13

recipients of public assistance, except for a distinction

14

that distinguishes new State residents from old State

15

residents.

16

The State has left a lot of latitude here.
The reason why new State residents and old State

17

residents can't be treated unequally has a lot to do with

the fact that they can't protect themselves in State

politics.

QUESTION:

2

Well, presumably they can get into

the political process, at least under your hypothesis, in

very short order.

5

MS. SULLIVAN:

That is correct, Mr. Chief

Justice, but -- they can get into the process to vote, but

7

they're still likely to be a small minority, and that's

8

not the true point.

The true point is that they cannot be

10

because of the structural postulates at stake in this

11

case.
Whether you look to the Privileges and

12

13

Immunities Clause of the Fourth Amendment, as Justice

14

O'Connor suggested in Zobel, to the Privileges and

15

Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to the

16

Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, or to the

17

Commerce Clause itself, it is clear that both to make us

18

one political union and to permit citizens to take

19

advantage of the laboratories of experiment that the

20

States represent, mobility across State lines must be

21

allowed.

22

And this Court has consistently said that that

23

means not only that States can't erect barriers at the

24

border, it also means that new State citizens cannot be

25

treated differently once they cross that border.

They

there's no good reason here.

In conclusion, the judgment below should either

be dismissed - - the case should either be dismissed

5

because the -- it is moot for the reasons explored

earlier, or in the alternative, if you reach the merits,

7

you should affirm, because the State has advanced no

permissible justification that is rationally related, much

goals.
