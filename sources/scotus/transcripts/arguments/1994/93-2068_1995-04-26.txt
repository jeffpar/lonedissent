ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD T. ROSENBLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROSENBLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the court of

4

appeals below erred in requiring Bivens plaintiffs to come

5

forward with direct evidence of unlawful intent in cases

6

that turn on intent, and in holding that reliance on

7

circumstantial evidence, no matter how probative, is

8

inadequate to overcome a claim of qualified immunity.

9

In this case, the district court found that the

20

petitioner in this case had supported his allegations, his

21

First Amendment allegations, with facts and evidence that

22

were concrete, specific, and nonconclusory.

23

In reversing, the court of appeals ruled that

24

the petitioner must also have come forward with direct

25

evidence of intent, and that reliance on circumstantial

1

evidence is insufficient to overcome a claim of qualified

2

immunity.

3

Now, there's no question, I think, that what the

4

court of appeals means by direct evidence of intent is

5

some evidence of an expression of intent that comes

6

directly from the lips of the defendant.

7

concurring opinion below put it, a confession.
Now, I'd like to address just two points here

8

9

As the

today.

First, that this direct evidence rule of the D.C.

10

Circuit is contrary to this Court's consistent precedent

11

with respect to direct and circumstantial evidence, and is

12

contrary to logic, we would submit, and secondly, that

13

this Court has available to it several options that will

14

strike a more appropriate balance between the rights of

15

the victims of constitutional violations to seek

16

vindication in court on the one hand, and the interest of

17

public officials to avoid the distractions that can come

18

from an insubstantial lawsuit.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Rosen -- go ahead.

QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenblatt, the district court

21

thought the case ought to proceed.

23

MR. ROSENBLATT:

24

QUESTION:

25

It didn't terminate

That's correct.

And an appeal was then taken by the

defendants in the case to the CADC.

Did you raise the

question there about whether an appeal was properly before

2

the CADC?

3

MR. ROSENBLATT:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ROSENBLATT:

The --

Cohen didn't permit an appeal?
We did not raise that question,

6

Your Honor.

7

the court of appeals for D.C. in the case of Siegert v.

8

Gilley.

9
10

The matter had been pretty well settled in

We didn't raise it.
QUESTION:

Obviously --

You're aware that we had a case

argued here recently --

11

MR. ROSENBLATT:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, and I think that --

-- that isn't too far removed from

13

this, the Johnson case, and I just wondered what your

14

position was on the -- whether the CADC had appellate

15

jurisdiction here.

16

MR, ROSENBLATT;

Qur position is first, even

17

though we didn't waive it -- even though we didn't assert

18

it it's not waived because it's a jurisdictional question,

19

and secondly, that would be one way for this Court to

20

resolve this case, to find that pursuant to the Court's

21

decision in Johnson, whatever that may turn out to be, we

22

find that there's no jurisdiction, there should have been

23

jurisdiction by the court of appeals, therefore the

24

district court's ruling which allowed the case to stay,

25

allowed the case to proceed with discovery, would be

reinstated.
QUESTION:

Or more precisely, that would be a

way for this Court not to resolve this case.

4

(Laughter.)

5

QUESTION:

Because the case would just continue,

6

and the same issue that we thought we would reach would

7

come up later.

8

9
10

MR. ROSENBLATT:

It's happened before, Your

Honor, that's correct.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenblatt, would that be so if

11

we were to say that there's no appellate jurisdiction

12

because it doesn't come under the Mitchell-Cohen

13

exception, then aren't we in effect saying that this kind

14

of defense doesn't fit under qualified immunity, that what

15

qualified immunity deals with is whether or not the law is

16

clearly established?

17

If we say -- make that jurisdictional

18

determination, and that means there is no qualified

19

immunity defense, then the heightened pleading rule, the

20

direct or indirect evidence goes out the window.

21

just not a qualified immunity issue.

22

MR. ROSENBLATT:

It's

I think that would be an

23

absolute legitimate reading of the Court's decision.

24

would urge the Court to be specific in saying, not require

25

the lawyers, those of us who practition in the area and

We

1

the judges below, to try to infer that that's what the

2

Court had in mind but -QUESTION:

3

How could it not be, when the whole

4

purpose of the lower courts exempting the special pleading

5

rule and the direct evidence rule was to tie it into this

6

qualified immunity?

7

MR. ROSENBLATT:

Well, my concern, Your Honor,

8

is that advocates and judges may well decide that it's a

9

part of qualified immunity, but it's not a part of

10

qualified immunity that's immediately appealable, because

11

this is all a balance that we're trying to reach.
QUESTION:

12

Well then, go back to the split

13

qualified immunity that it was originally the intention of

14

Harlow to get rid of.

15
16

MR. ROSENBLATT:

QUESTION:

21

That would be quite an irony, to go

that circle.

19
20

That's what would

happen.

18

Right.

MR. ROSENBLATT:

Right, and we don't think it's

We think that -QUESTION:

Are we supposed to address this

22

without -- I mean, I find this actually a rather difficult

23

question, whether it's appealable or not, and we have

24

another case that may shed some light, or may not, but

there's no decision of the lower court on this issue, is

there, and has it been fully briefed here?

2

think -- I mean, this -- I'm nervous about deciding this

3

without a lower court decision, without -- what do you

4

think we should do?
MR. ROSENBLATT:

I think the appealability issue

It -- the Court I think may

well find this way.

practicing that it could go ahead and strike down this

9

direct evidence rule and perhaps any heightened pleading

10

I think it would be helpful for those

rule, but not necessary.
QUESTION:

11

So you'd like us both to say it's --

12

we strike down the direct evidence rule and by the way, it

13

wasn't appealable.

MR. ROSENBLATT:

QUESTION:

What should we do?

23

MR. ROSENBLATT:

No.

It's our position, though,

24

that I think just, first and foremost the Court can, and

25

can sua sponte, on its own initiative, decide that there's

1

no jurisdiction at the court of appeals and there's no

2

jurisdiction in this Court, Your Honor, and that could be

3

the first -- that often is the first question that one

4

would look at, and it would be a way of disposing, or as

5

Justice Scalia says, not disposing of this issue.
QUESTION:

6

Then we get back to my question, but

7

if you say that, then aren't you, in effect, saying it

8

doesn't come within qualified immunity?

9

MR. ROSENBLATT:

I think if we assume that all

10

questions of qualified immunity are appealable, then we

11

would be saying yes, this is not a question of qualified

12

immunity, and therefore it's not an affirmative defense of

3

the Federal officials, but we would have to make that

4

assumption first that all questions that relate to

5

qualified immunity are appealable for us to get that

6

inference.

QUESTION:

You're familiar with the case that we

heard last week, which was a question of, what happened?
MR. ROSENBLATT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And this is a case is, what's in an

officer's head?

MR. ROSENBLATT:

23

QUESTION:

Right.

Is the first case, what happened, did

he do it, is that a qualified immunity defense when the

25

officer says, I didn't do it, I wasn't there?

It's our position that that is

not a qualified immunity defense.

That's the whole rub of

Qualified immunity -QUESTION:

MR. ROSENBLATT:

that it's not part of qualified immunity.

The D.C. Circuit says this isn't an IThis is a, even if I

didn't, you don't have direct evidence.

11

QUESTION:

This is an I-didn't-think-it.

12

MR. ROSENBLATT:

13

QUESTION:

I didn't think it, but --

Now, if an I-didn't-think-it defense

14

is just like an I-didn't-do-it defense, then neither of

15

them come within qualified immunity, but you hesitated,

16

and it's interesting that you did, because it seems to me

17

the courts of appeals are doing exactly that, having much

18

more difficulty categorizing, characterizing the I-didn't-

19

think-it than they had with I-didn't-do-it.

20

MR. ROSENBLATT:

Well, they're trying to strike

21

an appropriate balance here.

They're trying to -- they're

22

trying to put into content the concerns that this Court

23

expressed in Harlow.

24

Those concerns were that any question of state

25

of mind automatically goes to a jury, and therefore it's

1

inconsistent with the view that these cases should be

2

terminated quickly if they're insubstantial.

3

It's our view that that's no longer the case.

4

That concern, we think, has been put to rest in subsequent

5

opinions of this Court and the lower courts. It's no

6

longer the case that state of mind automatically goes to

7

jury -- to a jury.
But for Your Honor's question, the reason that

8

9

it's conceivable, although we would argue against it, it's

10

conceivable that courts of appeals would think that this

11

is still a matter of qualified immunity, is because it's

12

not only an I-didn't-think-it defense, it's a you-don't-

3

have-a-quantum-of-evidence allowing you to stay in court.

4

Whether I did it or not, it's your job, Mr. Petitioner, to

5

come forward with some evidence.

6
7

QUESTION:

Why isn't it the same for the I-

didn't-do-it?

8

MR. ROSENBLATT:

Well, the I-didn't-do-it, the

9

way I understood it, was more the ultimate question to be

20

decided, and in fact if this Court or if the lower courts

21

had - -

22

QUESTION:

Well, isn't whether I thought it also

23

is the ultimate question?

24

MR. ROSENBLATT:

25

It is the ultimate question.

The only way that it would be part of qualified immunity

1

is this idea of having a heightened standard, although not

2

proving your case, having enough to stay in court.
We would agree with Your Honor, though, that

3

4

first that it's -- that it is part of the I-didn't-do-it

5

defense, and that's not part of qualified immunity.

6

our view, qualified immunity is typically maybe I did it,

7

maybe I didn't.

8

The law wasn't clearly established.

10

It doesn't matter, because I'm immune.

QUESTION:

9

In

What are your views on the merits of

the issues that are here, Mr. Rosenblatt?
MR. ROSENBLATT:

11

Well, we think that the direct

12

evidence rule versus circumstantial evidence rule is

13

contrary to this Court's consistent precedent.

14

This Court has long held that there is

15

intrinsically no difference between direct and

16

circumstantial evidence, that sometimes circumstantial

17

evidence can be even stronger, more satisfying, more

18

persuasive than direct evidence, and that's particularly

19

true when, in cases like this, Justice Ginsburg, intent is

20

at issue.

21

Circumstantial evidence is often the only kind

22

of evidence to get an intent, and it's generally the most

23

reliable, how people act, how people behave are often much

24

more probative, far more reliable, far more enlightening

25

about someone's state of mind than what they say about it

1

after the fact.

2

So in our view, this is an arbitrary rule whose

3

only purpose is to eliminate Bivens cases, and I think we

4

should bear in mind that the only causes of action that

5

are actionable here, the only violations that are

6

actionable here because of the official's qualified

7

immunity, are violations of rights that are clearly

8

established, and so this rule would require Federal
officials and State officials to confess, to admit to have

10

violated a right that they are presumed to know about.
We think this is likely to happen in the most

11
12

extraordinary cases, and it would wipe out an entire line

13

of Bivens cases, Bivens cases that involve some of our

14

most treasured rights, the right -- it would eliminate

15

discrimination cases, racial, gender discrimination cases,

16

the selective prosecution cases, freedom to associate,

17

cruel and unusual punishment, and in this case the First

18

Amendment.

1

We think that the public interest -- and that's

20

what we're trying to do, I think, is achieve a balance.

21

The public interest in assuring that violations of that

22

type don't go unremedied is at least as strong as the

23

interest in sparing Federal officials the need to possibly

24

explain themselves when these rights are at issue.

same arguments against a heightened pleading rule as

2

opposed to a direct evidence rule, but would you like to

3

address the latter?

4

you as to the policy balance here, and we thought it was

5

very important to protect public officials from frivolous

suits, do we have the authority to impose a heightened

pleading rule?

8

Do you think, if we disagreed with

MR. ROSENBLATT:
pleading rule?

To allow the heightened

Well, let me say, Your Honor, the

10

answer -- it's problematic after this Court's decision in

11

Leatherman.

12

options that would strike a balance.

13

We believe, though that there are a number of

Let me be clear here.

We believe that there is

14

a legitimate policy reason to protect Federal officials

15

from insubstantial lawsuits, that at least within the

16

parameters of clearly established rights, Federal

17

officials should be free to engage in the unflinching

18

discharge of their duties, but when clearly established

1

rights are implicated, as this Court has held, Federal

20

officials should be made to hesitate, and so there

21

shouldn't be a total immunity against these suits.

22

Now, what options are available to the Court?

23

We think that no matter what option the Court takes, there

24

are going to be certain meritorious cases that get

25

dismissed, there are going to be certain blameless

officials who go through some discovery, but I think what

2

we should try to do is find a solution that minimizes both

3

possibilities.

4

The Solicitor General in this case, the

5

Government in this case has come up with a standard that

6

we would embrace.

7

Court has authority to adopt it because it's consistent

8

with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, namely, and

9

obviously the Government will articulate it better than I,

It basically -- and I think it's -- the

10

but namely when a defendant comes forward with a qualified

11

immunity defense, it's up to the plaintiff to give his

12

story.

13

what to whom when.

14

He can't hide the ball.

QUESTION:

He has to say who did

This is in the -- at the summary

judgment, early discovery phase, rather than the filing of

16

the complaint, I assume?

17

MR. ROSENBLATT:

Right.

We believe it could be

18

done before discovery, at least to tell the plaintiff's

19

story as he currently knows it so that the Government

20

officials and the Court can determine whether we're really

talking about clearly established rights.

MR. ROSENBLATT:

That's exactly right, and it

would have to be viewed in the early context of the case

in which there is no discovery.

8

should be taken into account.

9

QUESTION:

10

The -- at times the

Is that consistent with Rule 9?

MR. ROSENBLATT:

It is, Your Honor, because

11

Rule 9 says what has to be in a complaint, and that the

12

only heightened pleading that's permissible are for cases

3

of fraud, and so we think that it would be consistent with

4

9(b), because this is something that would go on during

5

the motion practice.

6

The one thing we would urge is that this direct

7

evidence standard should be rejected, and that the

8

adoption of almost any other standard leads to reversal of

9

the court below.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenblatt, don't you exaggerate

it somewhat by saying that although there's an interest in

law enforcement officers acting fearlessly, there's also

an interest in preventing their violating clearly

QUESTION:

But to what extent is Liberty Lobby

4

on the intent phase colored by the fact that it's a libel

case?
MR. ROSENBLATT:

6

It was a libel case which gave

7

even more protection to the defendants, and we think that

8

that actually draws a nice parallel, because we are

9

looking -- we do have policy reasons to protect the

10

defendants in this case, and so for that reason we think

11

that they're very close.
The main thing that Anderson did, at least in

12

13

many of these other cases, is show that state of -- just

14

because state of mind's at issue, just because you allege

it, doesn't mean that you get to drag, in this case

16

Federal officials through the litigation mud and into

18

and through vigorous applications of the current Federal

Rules of Civil Procedure, as they currently exist, to

protect what are very important values, namely officials

MR. ROSENBLATT:

Right, and it --

He has an affidavit that says that.

What must you do to get you to trial?
MR. ROSENBLATT:

6

Let me just point out, there is

7

no affidavit like that, but that's certainly their

8

position.

9

I think what we would have to do and I think

10

what we've done, although discovery is still early, what

11

we would have to do is come forward with facts and

12

evidence that would permit a jury, would be sufficient to

3

permit a jury to come back in our favor, and so in this

4

case, our main approach is to show that the explanations

5

given, that the inmate feared for his safety, was

6

pretextual, that the person who supposedly said that has

7

denied it in a sworn affidavit, that there was no concern

8

for the safety, that there was pressure from political

9

forces, and on and on.

Maybe one thing taken alone

20

wouldn't be enough, but taken together, we think it at

21

least creates a genuine issue of material fact, and that's

22

what's required in these cases at least to get more

discovery.

MR. BENDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
With regard to the question of the court of
appeals appellate jurisdiction which the court inquired

10

about at the beginning of petitioner's argument, under the

11

position that the Government took in Johnson and Jones,

12

which you heard last week, this would be appealable,

13

because it's a question that relates in some sense to the

14

qualified immunity defense.

15

Under the narrow -- the narrow view that only

16

questions of whether the law is clearly established are

17

appealable under Mitchell, then it would not be

18

appealable.

19

I think there's an in-between question.

20

thing that seemed to concern the Court most in Johnson and

21

Jones was whether the court would have to look through --

22

whether the appellate court would have to look through the

24

were in dispute or not.

it is a qualified immunity.
MR. BENDER:

Yes, right.

If you say -- but that

5

depends on a broader statement of the qualified immunity

6

defense than is necessary, so it's really a question of

7

how you define the qualified immunity defense, and also a

8

question of whether you want to limit appeals to the

9

question of law, or whether you want to expand appeals to

10

appeals that require looking through the record to see

11

whether there are sufficient factual allegations.

12

This question, the point I'm trying to make is

3

that in this case it was really a pure question of law

4

that related to a rule, that is, the direct evidence rule,

5

that the Court adopted as part of its vindication of

6

qualified immunity, and so it's not just any rule of law,

while meritorious suits are permitted to go forward, the

2

threat of litigation does not improperly interfere with an

3

official's exercise of discretion, and the actual bringing

4

of litigation, the burdens of litigation, going through

5

discovery and trial, does not interfere unduly with -- in

6

insubstantial cases --

7

QUESTION:

Well, cases where the allegation just

8

turns on the so-called improper motive of the official

9

seem to be cases that, as others have pointed out, are

10

very easily brought.

11

MR. BENDER:

12

QUESTION:

Right.
And difficult to deal with factually.

13

Now, just how should we deal with cases like that

14

involving public officials?

15

MR. BENDER:

Our view is consistent with the

16

views of, I think, seven circuits that have looked at this

17

question, and that is that the Court ought to adopt a

18

standard requiring specific allegations of the basis for

19

the claim of unconstitutional motive before you go to the

20

discovery stage of the case.

21

It's not a heightened pleading standard, because

22

I don't think it's fair to call it a pleading standard.

23

I'm not sure the Federal rules permit you to make it a

24

pleading standard, especially since Rule 9 says that

intent can be pleaded generally, and therefore I don't

think it's just -- if it's in the pleading, it satisfies

2

it, but even if it --

3
4

QUESTION:

Well, what rule do you tie it to?

What rule permits courts to do that?
MR. BENDER:

5

I think there are a couple of rules

6

that provide a basis for it.

One is Rule 26, which gives

7

a judge control over the discovery process, and which says

8

that the judge can consider in, I think it's

9

26(b)(2)(iii), the judge can consider whether the burdens

10

that the discovery is going to impose are worth it in

11

light of the nature of the case and the need of the

12

discovery.

3

I think that a judge, in order to implement this

4

Court's qualified immunity jurisprudence, and the feeling

5

the Court has had that people should have the right to be

6

free from discovery on insubstantial claims, that a judge

7

could enforce a heightened specificity standard --

Well, must.

I think you would say

that a judge -- it would be an abuse of discretion not to.
MR. BENDER:

In a -- yes, in a clear case, it

would be an abuse of discretion not to, right.
Another possibility is Rule 7, which permits the

23

court to order a reply so that when a defendant pleads a

24

defense of qualified immunity in response to the complaint

25

either through motion or through an answer, the court

1

could order the plaintiff to file a reply to that

2

supplemental pleading which would have to have the

3

specificity.

4

It's very much like -- as Justice Ginsburg said

5

before, it's very much like a motion for a more definite

6

statement, although this comes from the special concerns

7

of qualified immunity rather than the more general

8

concerns of the motion for a more definite statement.

9

QUESTION:

Could you take it as the pleading

10

defendant pleads, as the defendant, qualified immunity,

11

and that is taken automatically as -- a court in sum says

12

that's automatically a statement, a motion for a more

13

definite statement unless the complaint is already

14

sufficient?

15

MR. BENDER:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BENDER:

Right, yes.
And can we do that?
I think you can do that.

You can

18

say that that -- the plea of qualified immunity means that

19

the judge should require --

You'd say the plea of qualified

could not do that, so I think there are at least three

different bases --

MR. BENDER:

(b)(3), okay.

(b)(2) I didn't see --

(b)(2), and then there's (iii),

8

which talks about the judge dealing with the burdens of

9

discovery.

10

So what we would like to see is in response, and

11

I think, Justice O'Connor, this is -- this responds to

12

your question -- it certainly is possible for people to

13

just say, he or she did it with an unconstitutional

14

motive, but if you have a requirement that there has to be

15

some specificity -- what's that based on?

16

making that up?

just saying, well, he's a Republican,

18

therefore he must hate me, therefore he's doing something

19

to retaliate against me -- that wouldn't be enough.

Are you just

Are you just imagining that?

Are you

I'm a Democrat,

20

You've got to give some objective basis, or some

21

direct evidence basis if you have it, for saying that this

22

was something that was done with an unconstitutional

23

motive, and if the plaintiff isn't able to do that, then I

24

think there's a very, very great likelihood that it's an

25

insubstantial case, and the right thing to do would be to

dismiss it as early as possible, as the Court has said.
I don't think that's an absolute rule.

2

There

3

may be some cases where the judge would be convinced that

4

it would be proper to permit the plaintiff to do some

5

limited discovery because in the circumstances of the case

6

it's not fair to force the plaintiff to plead with more

7

specificity, given the circumstances, but I think those

8

would be extremely rare, and I think you can leave it to

9

the discretion of the district court to do -QUESTION:

10

That overlay would come from the

11

substantive rule about the qualified immunity protection,

12

because otherwise averments in an answer are deemed --

automatically deemed denied or avoided --

14

MR. BENDER:

15

QUESTION:

Right.
-- and here it was suggested that we

16

have just the opposite, automatic -- automatic assumption.

17

Instead of deeming that you deny it or avoid it, you must

18

answer it.

19

MR. BENDER:

Right, and you must answer it with

20

enough specificity to justify going forward, and I think

21

you're right that that comes from the desire of the

22

defense of qualified immunity to not have people forced to

go through discovery on insubstantial claims, and that it

is worthwhile testing whether the claim is substantial or

The direct evidence rule, on the other hand, we

2

3

agree completely with the petitioners there, although

adopted for the purpose of serving the purposes of

qualified immunity, that the threat of suit not interfere

8

9

It really doesn't do that.

It filters out some

cases, but it doesn't filter out cases depending upon

whether they're more or less substantial, or depending

11

upon whether they are in the area of unclear law or the

area of clear law.

rule that just filters out cases.

It seems much more like an arbitrary

It's almost as if in medical malpractice cases,

2

I think it's important at the outset to note

that we agree with the Solicitor General's Office with

respect to the point that heightened pleading standard is

5

misnomer, and the Court doesn't need to reach the so-

6

called heightened pleading standard issue in this case

7

because this case is really a heightened production case.

It's important to understand that this rule

Harlow made it very clear, as subsequent

Prior to Harlow, there was both a

Harlow extracted the subjective inquiry prong of

10

that analysis precisely because this Court recognized that

11

questions of motive like we have in this case can

inherently only be resolved by a jury, and this Court

13

decided, because of the numerous kinds of costs and

14

impediments that these kinds of lawsuits impose on public

officials, that it was not worth -- for protection of the

16

public and the protection of an efficiently run

17

government, it was not worth getting into the burdens of

I was not quarreling with that.

I was merely stating that to set the stage for why we have

these heightened pleading standards, or really, as in this

5

The District of Columbia Circuit, in adopting

this direct versus circumstantial component of this

think, attempting to come as close to what the purpose and

meaning of Harlow was, but at the same time preserving the

10

interests of allowing a petitioner, a plaintiff, to go

11

forward with the case where that plaintiff had only the

the part of an actor.

Do we have authority to do that?

a preponderance to prevail -MR. MARTINEZ:

9

Well, I -- Your Honor, I think

10

the answer to the question is that it stems from the very

11

strong message that this Court has sent in Harlow and

12

cases after Harlow that we do not want to get into motive.

13

We want to purge from the question of qualified immunity

14

what an official's motive is, and so the development of

15

any of these heightened pleading standards has been to try

16

and deal with the conflicting concerns of, you know, how

17

on the one hand do we decide these qualified immunity

18

cases on an objective basis when the question of motive

19

itself is inherently a subjective inquiry?

Leatherman certainly --

7

Leatherman held that municipalities sued under 1983 do not

have the ability to apply a heightened pleading standard,

9

do not have the ability to assert that a heightened

10

pleading standard applies to them, and this Court

11

specifically in Leatherman did not reach the issue of

whether a heightened pleading standard would apply to

individually sued public officials, and the rationale --

would preclude any application of heightened pleading

2

standards to these kinds of cases against public

3

officials, but there are also other courts that have

4

examined the issue and held to the contrary.
The D.C. Circuit has looked at it in this case,

5
6

as has the Ninth Circuit, and I believe one or two other

7

circuits have as well, so that issue obviously has not

8

been finally decided, but I would take issue with the

notion that Leatherman would exclude this kind of rule in

10

cases where public officials are sued in a Bivens or

11

context.
QUESTION:

12

983

Do I understand that your argument,

3

that its root is that the reason this case does not come

4

within Leatherman is that there is a general proposition

5

of immunity law that we should not, in fact, tolerate any

6

more -- any further causes of action than absolutely

7

necessary if those causes of action require an inquiry

into motive?

characteristic or element of qualified immunity.

QUESTION:

I do agree with that, Your Honor.

Well, if that -- if

12

Justice Ginsburg's statement of the law is correct, then

13

doesn't that, in effect, eliminate your argument that we

14

should be deciding this case in accordance with a

15

generalized policy of inquiring into the motives of

16

officials?

Isn't that the end of your argument?

17

MR. MARTINEZ:

18

QUESTION:

No, it --

Because there are some causes of

19

action, you admit, that do involve motive, and we can and

should inquire into them, and if that is the case, then

So I thought that the basis for your argument,

an alternative basis, which I'd as soon you address if you

want, is that if there isn't some kind of heightened

pleading thing, the seven or 600 district judges will

probably have 50,000 cases filed by everybody who wants to

sue everybody all over the Government, and instead of just

getting rid of them right away because there are no facts,

you don't know what they are, or if you could find out the

of Bivens.

MR. MARTINEZ:

1

I believe it has, Your Honor, but

2

that's not in the record, and I don't have any figures to

3

point to other than, the only figures that are in the

4

record are the Solicitor General noted in his brief that I

5

believe for the years 1993 and 1994 --

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Martinez --

7

MR. MARTINEZ:

-- there were something like

8

1,500 or 1,600 cases against the Bureau only, and that I

9

think ultimately only two of those resulted in a judgment.

10

I'm not sure of those numbers exactly, but it's roughly

11

along those lines.
Now, those figures don't tell us how many of

12

13

those cases went through a discovery phase, how many of

14

them, you know, were dealt with at what stage and how they

15

ultimately got dealt with by the district courts, but I

16

think it is fair to say that yes, a substantial number of

17

these cases have been filed and continue to be filed.
QUESTION:

18

Mr. Martinez, I wonder with regard to

19

qualified immunity under 1983, a) who invented the

20

qualified immunity defense, and b) who invented the rule

21

that subjective motivation won't defeat a qualified motive

22

defense?

23

MR. MARTINEZ:

Well, Justice Stevens, the 1983

24

qualified -- qualified immunity is a judicial doctrine

25

that goes back many years, and the Court in a couple of

decisions in the 1970's, after Bivens had been announced

2

by this Court, applied and expanded the qualified immunity

3

doctrine to apply to both 1983 and Bivens cases.

4

QUESTION:

I was just suggesting, and really

5

trying to be helpful to you, that the Court has not always

6

relied on more traditional forms of lawmaking in this

7

whole area of the law.

MR. MARTINEZ:

MR. MARTINEZ:

That's correct, Your Honor,

Justice Ginsburg.
If I may, with the time I have left, we have --

15

I'd like to address the point we made in our brief with

16

respect to an alternative standard.

17

the Court decides -- and I appreciate that you have

18

recognized the problem, as Justice Breyer said, that there

19

is a problem here.

20

that the direct versus circumstantial evidence test is not

21

the way the Court wants to proceed in dealing with this

If for some reason

If for some reason the Court decides

- problem, we believe an alternative that the Court ought to

23

consider and adopt is the clear and convincing evidence

24

test, as we've outlined in our brief.

25

That is a test that is applied by this Court in

1

various other areas of the law.
QUESTION:

2

It's well-developed --

I really -- I got that from your

3

brief.

4

of this would be, there are a lot of claims that if you

5

knew what the person was claiming, you'd say to the

6

plaintiff, what is your point, and by the time he

7

explained his point, you would see there was no case.

8

9

I mean, I don't see that one.

I mean, the purpose

But sometimes, there is a case, and of course,
if when he's explained his point there is a case, why

10

should you impose a greater burden on that plaintiff than

11

any other plaintiff in the United States?

12

MR. MARTINEZ:

Because of the -- Justice Breyer,

13

because of the particular concerns that underlie the

14

rationale of Harlow.

15

The way that test would work would be a -- when

16

a complaint is filed, the Government would respond with a

17

motion to dismiss or for summary judgment asserting

18

qualified immunity, and this is only in motive-based

19

cases, I hasten to add, asserting qualified immunity, and

20

then to rebut the allegation of improper motive, the

21

burden would shift to the plaintiff to respond with clear

22

and convincing evidence that there was an improper motive,

23

and we believe the application of that standard would help

24

obviate this problem a little bit.

25

Under that standard, circumstantial evidence, we

1

contemplate, would be permitted in, but it would still

2

have to be very high circumstantial and direct evidence,

3

because it would have to add up, as it does in a libel

4

setting, to clear and convincing evidence to defeat a

5

motion of qualified immunity where intent is a factor.

6

And finally, I would like to say that regardless

7

of which of these standards you apply, if you decide to

8

apply one of them, it's important to emphasize again that

9

on the facts of this case, the actions of the respondents

10

were objectively reasonable.

11

alleged in this case,

12

that even shows that these two respondents ever spoke to

13

each other, let alone conspired, and it's important to

14

keep that in mind.

15

Indeed, a conspiracy is

but there's nothing in the record

This case is Exhibit A, in our view, as to why

16

there should be a heightened pleading or proof standard

17

and as to why, as this Court said in Butz v. Economou,

18

these insubstantial cases should be terminated quickly and

19

promptly, and if there are no further questions, Your

20

Honor, that completes my argument.

I'd just like to make a few points.

1

One is that

2

whether we call it a heightened pleading or a heightened

3

production standard, this rule fashioned by the D.C.

4

Circuit is contrary to the Federal Rules of Civil

5

Procedure.
If they call it a heightened production

6

7

standard, then it's contrary to Rule 56 in many ways,

8

first, because not all inferences are drawn in favor of

9

the nonmoving party, as the rule requires, and secondly

10

because discovery is not allowed, as Rule 56 would

11

ordinarily require, at least would give the district court

12

discretion.

13

QUESTION:

Why does the D.C. Court of Appeals

14

feel impelled to invent this special pleading rule,

15

heightened evidence rule?

16

MR. ROSENBLATT:

Well, it's clearly the case

17

that there are two interests here to be balanced.

18

them is to protect Federal officials against insubstantial

19

lawsuits.

20

do that in many cases, but it goes way too far in favor of

21

them in other cases.

22

Thank you.
