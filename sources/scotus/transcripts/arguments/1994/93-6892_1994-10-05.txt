ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH W. GANDERT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GANDERT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether a charged

11

motive to fabricate may be rebutted under Federal Rule of

12

Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) by seven out-of-court statements

13

made after declarant had that same motive to fabricate.

14

We are asking this Court to hold, as did the

15

common law, that a prior consistent statement rebuts a

16

charged improper motive only if that motive did not exist

17

at the time the statement was made.

18

The criminal charges in this case arose out of a

19

bitter child custody dispute between the petitioner,

20

Matthew Tome, and his ex-wife.

21

small daughter, who is referred to in the briefs by the

22

initials A.T.

The dispute involved their

23

The first time the child mentioned any abuse was

24

14 months after it was alleged to have taken place, and it

25

was coincidentally on the same date a child custody

hearing was supposed to have taken place.

2

witnesses were allowed by the court to tell what A.T. had

very weak testimony at trial of A.T.

5

statements were admitted as substantive evidence.

All of these

As the trial judge ruled in his order releasing

7

Mr. Tome pending a decision of this Court, the testimony

8

of the six witnesses about statements made by the child

9

substantially caused the defendant's conviction.

10

The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the

11

admission of the statements, all of the statements under

12

801(d)(1)(B), and set forth a balancing test under Federal

13

Rules of Evidence 402 and 403 to determine whether the

14

statements had probative value apart from mere repetition.

15

They took into consideration three factors:

16

1) the strength of the motive; 2) the circumstances in

17

which the statement was made, and 3) the declarant's

18

demonstrated propensity to lie.

19

The court of appeals failed to consider that the

20

child had the same motive at the time she made her

21

statements as at the time of trial.

22

which was imposed by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals,

23

is inconsistent both with the plain language of the rule

24

and the common law history behind 801(d)(1)(B).

25

QUESTION:

That balancing test,

You say it's inconsistent with the

statement was offered to rebut, do you?
MR. GANDERT:

3

You don't question that the

We're indicating that the

4

statement was offered, but whether it was offered for

5

rebuttal, we have some question in regard to that.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GANDERT:

8

What is that question?
The question is that in terms of

rebuttal it did not meet the premotive standard, and it's
implicit and inherent in the rule that any statement which

10

is made to rebut occurs prior to the motive to fabricate.
QUESTION:

11

Well, let's go through the language

phrase by phrase.

14

of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.

The testimony has to be, is offered to

17

MR. GANDERT:

It says

Our contention, Your Honor, is

18

that by offered, that means that the court has to make a

1

decision that if the statement, if it is allowed in and

20

accepted, that a jury would find that a statement actually

21

rebuts.

22

QUESTION:

So you say the court has to make a

decision and then the jury has to make the same decision?
MR. GANDERT:

The court has to make an initial

determination similar to the determinations made in other

1

evidentiary questions as to preliminarily whether the

2

statement does in fact rebut, because if the court -- if a

3

party is allowed to present a statement which does not in

misrepresentation upon the court.

12

Why shouldn't the same rule apply here?

particularly narrow purpose.

Well, do you think the Federal Rules

of Evidence simply froze the common law in place?
MR. GANDERT:

That's not our contention.

Our

22

contention is that the Federal rules, that Rule

23

801(d)(1)(B) was embodied with the background, against the

24

background of the common law, and the rule must be read in

25

that context.

QUESTION:

1

But the rules have also been

“V

^

2

interpreted to mean that they have liberalized

3

admissibility of evidence, that that was one of their

4

purposes.

5

That's correct, Your Honor, but

6

the hearsay rules in particular are rules of exclusion,

7

and most of them are derived from the common law, and this

8

rule must be read in the context of the common law.

9

^

MR. GANDERT:

The advisory committee, when they adopted this

10

rule, indicated that the purpose of this rule was to

11

change the admissibility of evidence which was formerly

12

admissible as - - for rehabilitation would now be

13

admissible for substantive evidence, and so that was the

14
15

only change they indicated in the rule as it had been at
common law.

15

They indicated that traditionally -- prior

17

consistent statements traditionally have been admissible

18

to rebut charges of recent fabrication or improper

19

influence or motive, but not as substantive evidence.

20

Under the rule, they are substantive evidence.

21

the only change that the advisory committee made.

23

QUESTION:

That was

Well, that's the only change that the

advisory committee's notes mention.

MR. GANDERT:

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The grammar's against you, isn't it?

’

If we were to read it the way you, you were

2

reading it to start with in such a way that the word

3

recent modifies not only fabrication but influence or

4

motive.

That's correct, isn't it - - yes.

5

MR. GANDERT:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Wouldn't the natural way, if that

7

were the intent, to - - the modifier recent apply to all

8

three, wouldn't the natural way to write it have been

9

recent fabrication, comma, improper influence or motive?

10

But you've got an extra or in there which suggests to me

11

at least that recent refers to fabrication but not

12

necessarily to the others in the series.

13

MR. GANDERT:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Our

14

reading of the rule is that recent means more recent than

15

the prior consistent statement.

16

meaning, and it has to have -- there has to be some reason

17

it was put into the rule.

|

18

QUESTION:

Recent has a temporal

Well, the reason it was put into the

19

rule may be that it was intended simply to modify

20

fabrication.

21

retention of the common law rule is an argument that has

22

pretty much got to rest on things like the failure to note

23

that they were in this respect revising the common law, or

24

the rejection of the Weinstein approach, et cetera, as

25

opposed to the grammar, because it seems to me the grammar

1

is a problem for you unless you can explain it otherwise

2

to me.

3

MR. GANDERT:

We would also agree with what His

4

Honor has indicated regarding, there was a rejection of

5

the Weinstein view by the committee which adopted the

6

Federal rules, and they did indicate that they did not

7

want there to be widespread use of hearsay only upon the

8

declarant being available for cross-examination, and there

9

was a rejection of the Weinstein view, there was a

10

rejection of the Model Codes of Evidence which were

11

adopted in adopting this rule.
This rule, there was no argument regarding this

12

13

rule as opposed to 801(d)(1)(A) and 801(d)(1)(C).

14
15

QUESTION:

If we find that recent modified

simply fabrication, do you lose the case?

MR. GANDERT:

No.

That's just one particular

17

aspect of the rule, and we - - the problem in this case is

18

that the child - -

QUESTION:

Well, can you walk me through the

20

rule?

If recent fabrication doesn't help you, are you

21

then admitting the testimony to rebut an improper

influence?

23

MR. GANDERT:

QUESTION:

does modify motive?

It's improper motive or influence.

Well, improper in your view, then,

1

MR. GANDERT:

Yes, as well, Your Honor, and I

2

think that's the way most commentators in most cases have

3

read it, that it's improper motive or improper influence.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Well, is it an improper motive to

want to be with your maternal parent?
MR. GANDERT:

The charged improper motive was

7

actually that she wanted to be with her mother rather than

8

her father.

9
10

QUESTION:

Is that improper?

MR. GANDERT:

That's the charge that the

11

Government made that the defense counsel was asserting,

12

and they -- it's only upon a charge of an improper motive

13

that all these statements were allowed in.

14

no charge of an improper motive, all these statements

15

would have been hearsay and would have been kept out.

16

QUESTION:

If there was

I suppose it would be improper in the

17

context that it's improper to allow you, to allow the

18

witness to change their testimony.

19

that sense.

20

MR. GANDERT:

It's improper only in

It's improper in the sense that

21

that's the way the rule makes out the motive, and the

22

Government claimed that defense counsel had charged that

23

the improper motive was that the child wanted to live with

24

her mother rather than her father, and that that child had

25

the same identical motive at the time she first made her

The charged improper motive at trial by the

more friends, more toys, and --

QUESTION:

Mr. Gandert, here's the problem that

15

you confront if you sever the recent, the word recent from

16

the latter part, namely from improper influence or motive.

As long as recent is attached to the words, you

can make the argument that the purpose of the rebuttal has

I had this story way back at the beginning before my

Your Honor, we would contend that

8

this case concerns a recent fabrication, and what happened

9

here is there was a 14-month delay before the child made

10

her first accusation.
QUESTION:

11

I'm not talking about what it

12

concerns, I'm talking about your reading of the text.

13

does it not tend to disprove an improper motive, namely

14

the improper motive of wanting to live with my mother

15

instead of my father?

16

MR. GANDERT:

That -- in this case, the problem

3

is that the child had the same motive, so no motive was

disproved.

Therefore, all of her testimony is mere

QUESTION:

Well, you don't disprove the motive

to rebut a charge of recent or improper -- oh, I see, you

11

think you must have to eliminate the existence of the

motive.

13

the fact that the motive was the reason for your

statement.

I thought all you have to eliminate to rebut is

15
16

MR. GANDERT:

That's exactly what you have --

what His Honor indicated that you have to do.

17

QUESTION:

Oh, I stand by my view that it

18

certainly tends to disprove that in this case, if you can

19

show, this is not something that I've been pumped up for

20

at trial, that my mother put in my ear in order to get me

21

to go back to live with her, as I want to do, but rather,

22

I said this way back, long before it's at all likely that

anybody put the notion in my head.

1

doesn't meet the strict requirements of the rule.

Perhaps

2

it's relevant, perhaps it's reliable under, perhaps,

3

803(24), but the purpose of this rule was a narrow one of

4

rebutting that charge.
The charge -- when the child has the same motive

5
6

before as at the time of trial, it doesn't rebut the

7

charge.

Now - QUESTION:

8

9

What you've just said indicates that

you're modifying what you said earlier.

That is, you've

10

made the flat statement, it would not have come in, and

11

now you've just mentioned that, well, it might well have

12

come in under a different rule.

MR. GANDERT:

QUESTION:

It possibly --

Which would make this whole thing

15

academic, right, if it could, at least the three

MR. GANDERT:

QUESTION:

20
21

It's 80 --

All of it might come in under the

catch-all.
MR. GANDERT:

We contend that it would not, but

22

the Tenth Circuit failed to go into that thorny issue and

23

decide whether or not the statements were admissible under

24

other rules.

25

they were not admissible under 803(4), and I can give the

rationale why we indicated that, but the statements, the

pediatricians, they might have come in, they might not

have.

We contend they would not have.
It's clear that the babysitter's second

4
5

statement, which was very elaborate, highly prejudicial,

6

highly descriptive, the judge rejected the Government's

7

attempt to allow that statement in under 803(24), and

8

instead indicated it was solely admitted under

9

801(d)(1)(B).
QUESTION:

10

^

Well, the trial judge seemed to have

11

some confusion about whether it would come in, would have

12

to have a limiting instruction that it would be hearsay,

13

that hearsay somehow, even if it fell under an exception,

14

wasn't admissible for all purposes, it would have to be

15

admitted -- it was very confusing, I thought.

16

Maybe you could tell me if I'm wrong about this.

17

If something falls under a hearsay exception, then it

18

comes in as evidence and you don't need to have a limiting

19

instruction.

20

MR. GANDERT:

I believe what Your Honor said is

21

correct.

22

parties were fairly confused regarding the admissibility

23

of this type of evidence, especially since as witness

24

after witness came in, all of their testimony was being

25

allowed in apparently under 801(d)(1)(B), and then

sometimes the judge would indicate that the evidence was

also being allowed in under another rule as well,

sometimes he was not explicit.

4
5

indicating upon what reason the judge was admitting some

6

of the statements.

7

He did not make it all explicit.

The Tenth Circuit indicated that it was their

8

understanding that everything was being admitted under --

9

or at least, they went along with that everything was

10

being admitted under 801(d)(1)(B) rather than reaching

11

those other issues, which they could have gone into as

12

alternative reasons for their decision, but they did not.

13

'

There's a lot of problems involved in the record

Another problem involved in this case is that

14

what this case is doing is rejecting the common law.

15

case has to be read in context with the common law, and in

16

context with the common law, it indicates that a premotive

17

statement, only statements which were made prior to the

18

motive were admissible at common law.

19

We believe that the Court adopted -- the Court,

20

Congress and the advisory committee adopted the common law

21

view of 801(d)(1)(B).

QUESTION:

If the rule speaks in terms of, in

No, we don't ignore the language

Mr. Gandert, why don't you go back to

you are attempting to offset?

MR. GANDERT:

Why can't rebut, or doesn't,

Because rebut has to be read in

20

the common law way, with the common law history in mind,

MR. GANDERT:

It doesn't -- it doesn't in that

the word rebut and going back to the terms of

MR. GANDERT:

Oh, I think rebut has to be read

11

in terms of its common law history and the way it was

considered at common law, and at common law, as Justice

Stevens indicated, only statements made prior to motive to

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

directly addressed by a specific provision of the Federal

Rules of Evidence, Rule 801(d)(1)(B), which is set forth

in respondent's brief, the blue brief, on the very first

2

page following the table of authorities.

3

The court of appeals properly resolved this case

4

under this rule, which was the narrowest ground of

5

decision available to it, because under this rule, the

6

evidence was admissible if it were offered to rebut a

7

charge of fabrication, whereas under the other rules that

8

were considered in the district court, the evidence would

9

have been admissible more broadly regardless of whether

10

there had been a charge of fabrication by the witness, so

11

the court of appeals properly chose to address only the

12

narrowest ground for decision rather than the Rule 803(4)

13

or 803(24) ground.

14

QUESTION:

Would you agree on that basis,

15

Mr. Wallace, that even if it were not admissible under

16

801(d)(1)(B)(3), it might nevertheless be admissible on

17

the ground the district court relied on?

18
19

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the district court relied on

this ground as well.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WALLACE:

But we certainly would argue that

it was admissible on the other grounds.

and, of course, the catch-all would have made this

evidence admissible regardless of these other

considerations, but as I say, what the court chose was the

5

narrowest ground of decision.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, may I ask you before you

7

go further to say a word about the grammar on the question

8

whether the adjective recent does modify anything other

9

than fabrication?

10

^

Now --

When I asked your opposing counsel that

11

question, I said that it seemed odd that if recent was

12

intended to modify improper influence or motive, that

13

there simply wasn't a comma after the word fabrication,

14
15

and Justice Stevens and I have been having an exchange of

16

your brother perhaps suggested it, too, is that if the

17

further modifier, improper, modifies both influence and

18

motive, and that seems to be the accepted view, that would

19

be a reason for putting the word or after fabrication.

20

you think that may be the answer, so that the grammar

21

perhaps is at best ambiguous here?

22

notes, and one of the things that has come up, and I think

MR. WALLACE:

There may be some ambiguity in the

23

grammar, although I think your point is one that is very

24

well taken.

25

QUESTION:

Do

Well, which point, the first one?

1

MR. WALLACE:

The first one that you said, that

2

ordinarily if you wanted the word recent to carry over,

3

you would have a comma before the second in the series,

4

and then to be clear you probably would have -- it would

5

say, recent fabrication, comma, improper influence or

6

improper motive, add the word improper again.

7

make it clear that the recent carried over.

8

9

That would

And it seems to me the natural reading of the
grammar as it's written here is that recent modifies

10

fabrication, and then improper influence or motive can

11

both be improper, because you no longer would have another

12

way of indicating that the improper carried over unless

13

you repeated it.

14

QUESTION:

But do you think it would make much

15

sense to read the word recent as modifying the phrase,

16

improper influence, that what they're concerned with is a

17

recent -- only with a recent improper influence?

18

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I would think not.

For one

19

thing, in Wigmore and other common law sources, recent

20

fabrication is discussed separately from improper

21

influence or motive, which is not modified in the

22

discussion by the word recent.

It wants you to get at rebutting the

MR. WALLACE:

Well, it seems to me that that way

8

of looking at it would have much greater force under the

9

old common law practice where the statement was not itself

10

admissible but could be used only to rehabilitate the

11

testimony on the stand.

12

The first thing to be noticed about this rule is

13

the very beginning of it, before you get to the number 1.

14

It says, a statement is not hearsay if, and that was a

15

deliberate and fundamental departure from the common law

16

practice, and this was not a hidden agenda.

17

This is, what, the only paragraph in the

18

advisory committee notes set forth on page 21 of the blue

19

brief, just below the middle of the page, explicitly

20

explains at common law they were available only to

21

rehabilitate whatever was said on the stand.

22

But the advisory committee to this extent was

23

adopting the more modern view of scholars who had

24

criticized the common law as too restrictive of hearsay.

QUESTION:

6

MR. WALLACE:

7

QUESTION:

-- that view was being adopted.

-- it's used for a broader purpose,

8

but the test for its admissibility is still the narrow,

9

old test, and that test is not to show that the witness is

telling the truth, and it's very peculiar that it's put

that way.

12

It's not admitted to - - you know, if the

some reason why you think the witness is lying.

argue that the witness should not be believed, that the

QUESTION:

It seems to me, Mr. Wallace, your

position is that the rule as written has the same meaning

and lends credibility to that testimony.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, and is -- it lends -- well,

I think that that is an alternative way of expressing what
the rule says, consistent with that testimony, and is
offered to rebut a charge that the testimony is the
product of an improper motive.
If it adds credibility, if it lends further
credibility to that testimony, that is a way of rebutting
the charge that the testimony is the product of an
improper motive rather than the truth.
QUESTION:

Any prior consistent statement would

help a witness who's not very articulate.

why you'd want to shoe-horn it under that.

6

MR. WALLACE:

Well, yes, there are a number of

credibility to the testimony on the stand by explaining

what was said in other contexts and in other circumstances

that the rules themselves contain a guide to their

interpretation, and that is in Rule 102, which was not

does not diminish the justification relied upon by the

trying to show that the testimony that the child gave on

the stand was not the product of an improper motive by

showing that she gave very consistent testimony, and

7

detailed testimony, in circumstances where, while that

motive may have still been in existence, the circumstances

would have made that motive less pronounced than other

10

motives in talking to people that she explained on the

stand whose job it was to help kids.

12

This is in talking to the social case worker, in

13

talking to three pediatricians about what happened to her,

14

in spontaneously telling her babysitter what happened in a

understood that any effect on custody really could emanate

MR. WALLACE:

Well, in many ways this case is

5

reminiscent of the problem that the Court had before it in

6

the Daubert case, in which a contention was being made

7

that the old rule of the Frye case should be preserved

8

under the Federal Rules of Evidence, which would allow

9

scientific evidence in only when it's generally accepted.

10

A

That's one of the problems the case presents, I

And in the portion of Daubert that was

11

unanimous, the Court rejected that as inconsistent with

12

the more liberal thrust of the rules and their very

13

generous definition of relevant evidence that a more

14

multifaceted nuanced approach rather than what the Court

15

called the austere standard, a per se rule for all cases,

16

should be adopted.

17

It's very comparable, it seems to us, to the

18

premotive rule.

Sixth Circuit case called United States v. Lawson, which

21

is cited in respondent's brief, and appropriately enough

as I read it, there is a child, 6 years old, who is in the

court, not being able to be cross-examined very thoroughly

because she can't answer most of the time, and then when

9

you look back at this particular set of evidence, if the

10

relevancy we're supposed to look to is the relevancy to

11

show lack of a motive, all these statements were made

12

after the mother took the child, and the mother could have

told the child in the car, hey, I want you to stay with

me.

My goodness.

In this particular case,

So the relevancy seems small, and if you look at

the prejudice, it looks like this was the evidence on the

this provision to incorporate or at least refer by

A motive is only improper if it causes a witness
to fabricate her story, and we quote Professor Graham to
this effect on footnote 3 on page 5 of our reply brief,
