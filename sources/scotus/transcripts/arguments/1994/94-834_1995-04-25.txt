ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN B. FEIRSON

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FEIRSON:

12

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

This Court is once again confronted with the

5

task of having to borrow a statute of limitations to fill

6

in in another Federal statute for the situation where the

7

Congress has failed to provide a limitations period.

8
9
20
21

In this particular instance, the statute is the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or
WARN.
In creating WARN, the Congress took a right

22

which already existed under the National Labor Relations

23

Act for unionized employees -- that is, the right to

24

advance notice of impending plant closings or mass layÂ­

25

offs, first standardized the notice period to 60 days, and

1

then extended that right of notice to nonunionized

2

employees.

3

The ultimate goal behind both the notice

4

provision in the National Labor Relations Act and WARN is

5

to provide employees with the opportunity to do something

6

to lessen the adverse effects brought upon them by this

7

severe economic dislocation.

8

9

The fact that WARN follows the NLRA model has
resulted in the regulations which have been drafted to

10

govern WARN coming to a substantial extent from the

11

National Labor Relations Act, and has also resulted in

12

numerous court decisions which look to the National Labor

13

Relations Act to try to fill in the interstices of WARN.

14

This Court in the past has counseled that in

15

these type of borrowing situations, while there is

16

generally a presumption in favor of State law borrowing,

17

when a Federal source clearly provides a closer analogy

18

and where the Federal policies at stake and litigation

19

practicalities make that Federal source a significantly

20

more appropriate vehicle, then the borrowing ought to come

21

from the Federal source.

22

In this particular instance, with respect to the

23

WARN act, we believe that you have a National Labor

24

Relations Act which is by far a closer analogy than any

25

which exists at State law, and we also believe that the

1

National Labor Relations Act both furthers the underlying

2

purpose of the WARN act, that particular statute of

3

limitations, and also would tend to avoid the kind of

4

forum shopping and collateral litigation which would be

5

inevitable if State law borrowing and also would tend to

6

avoid the kind of forum shopping and collateral litigation

7

which would be inevitable if State law borrowing goes

8

along with the WARN act.
QUESTION:

9
10

We really haven't borrowed very often

from the National Labor Relations Act, have we?
MR. FEIRSON:

11

No.

This Court did borrow from

12

the National Labor Relations Act, for example, in 1983 in

13

DelCostello.

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

MR. FEIRSON:

But it has -- this Court, until

16

fairly recently, simply didn't borrow very often from any

17

Federal statute until the last 10 or 12 years.
QUESTION:

18

I suppose you're going to get to this

19

at some point, but will you comment specifically on why

20

the NLRA is a better source, is subject to a better

21

analogy than the Pennsylvania statute for payment of back

22

wages due?

23

MR. FEIRSON:

Yes.

The fact that under the

24

National Labor Relations Act one of the things that's

25

going on is a balancing of interests -- that is, the
6

1

interest of employees in getting notice, and then

2

ultimately in seeking some type of benefit to aid them in

3

the event of a plant closing and a mass layoff, and what

4

the WARN act is attempting to do is almost precisely the

5

same.
I mean, ultimately there are differences, to be

6

7

sure, but ultimately the purpose behind both is to give

8

employees notice so they can do something to help protect

9

themselves against the loss of their job.
QUESTION:

10

But the notice to the National Labor

11

Relations Board is to invoke the board's procedure so that

12

it can preserve the bargaining context over the short

13

period of time when collective bargaining agreements often

14

exist.

15

money judgment, to a money claim for an employee.

16

It seems to me that's quite inapplicable to a

True, the employee needs it as fast as he or she

17

can get it for retraining, et cetera, but it seems to me

18

that this is much more, frankly, like the Fair Labor

19

Standards Act cause of action under Federal law.

20

to me that's the analogy.

21

MR. FEIRSON:

It seems

Both under the National Labor

22

Relations Act and under the WARN act it seems to me that

23

the same goal is being pursued, which is not simply a

24

collective bargaining goal under the National Labor

25

Relations Act.

I mean, yes there is a value in having the

1

employer talk to employee organizations, but there is an

2

end in mind, and the end in mind is to provide the

3

opportunity to ameliorate the effects of a plant closing

4

or a layoff, which is precisely what WARN is doing.

5

The FLSA does nothing more than say, the law

6

says that when you work overtime you get paid time-and-a-

7

half, and guess what, if your employer doesn't pay you

8

time-and-a-half, you have a right to get the money that

9

you earned.

It has very little to do with this notice

10

notion, and the use of the notice to somehow try to buffer

11

the economic harm that's going to occur to employees when

12

they lose their job.

13

QUESTION:

I may have jumped ahead.

It's not

14

clear to me that if we agree that a Federal statute should

15

apply, that we should make the determination of which

16

statute at this level rather than remanding, but the

17

analysis does seem to be tangled at almost every juncture.

18

I suppose we look in part to how close the analogy is to

19

the National Labor Relations Act in deciding whether to

20

take the State or Federal law, but if we do that, then I

21

think we probably also should look at the Fair Labor

22

Standards Act.

23

MR. FEIRSON:

Well, I believe the Court ought to

24

look at all those acts.

Again, though, the right -- there

Relations Act which is almost identical to the right which

2

WARN gave to nonunion employees, which is a right to get

notice of a plant closing, to prevent an employer from

It's pursuant to -- it arises

Excuse me, the NLRA requires

on employees when a plant closes, for example.

to have effective effects bargaining, there has to be

notice of the plant closing.

19

The NLRA requires the union and the

In order

I mean, if the employer comes in, in my example,

20

on Monday and says the plant's closed, it minimizes the

21

ability to have effective bargaining, so under the

National Labor Relations Act, for unionized employees

there is this notice right.

MR. FEIRSON:

collective bargaining process will result in something

Ultimately, the hope is, although

Well, it depends, too, on what level

of generality you're talking about.

You could go back to

10

the findings in 1935 and say the end is labor peace, but

11

that doesn't really help you much in this case.
MR. FEIRSON:

12

No, but in an effects bargaining

13

situation, what's crystal clear is that when the union

14

sits down with the management, what the union is seeking

15

is some type of aid for the employees that are going to

lose their jobs:

Well, the filing of a 301 action

in court, while it clearly has an impact later on the

I mean, there's a suit by an employee who says,

And so the ease in some cases it

doesn't seem to me is a good reason to assume ease in all.

5

Let me go back to another aspect of the analogy.

6

One thing the NLRA does not do is to provide that if you

7

fail to warn, you've got to pay 60 days' wages, and what

8

we're dealing with is the case in which the policy of the

9

act in fact is not realized, the warning is not given, and

20

at that point it seems to me the employee is in exactly

21

the same position as the employee who has not gotten paid

22

for the last 60 days that he worked.

23

wages, and why,for that reason isn't the analogy with the

24

wage claim statute, and I will say a State wage claim

25

statute, the strongest analogy?

He's owed 60 days'

MR. FEIRSON:

1

Well, first of all, Justice

2

Souter, you are entitled, an employee would be entitled

3

under the National Labor Relations Act to back pay in that

4

situation, so in other words, if you have two identical -QUESTION:

5

Yes, but he's -- the NLRA doesn't

6

have any formula to the effect that if you fail, it's

7

equal -- the failure is equal to 60 days' wages.

8

MR. FEIRSON:

9

QUESTION:

Does it?

MR. FEIRSON:

10

It is --

No, but it can be greater.

It can

11

be greater or it can be lesser, depending on how many

12

days - -

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. FEIRSON:

15

Depending on the agreement.
Well, no, depending on how many

days' wages were actually lost.

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

17

MR. FEIRSON:

But the concept is that in both

18

the NLRA situation and in the WARN act situation, back pay

19

for a failure to give notice is a remedy.

20

The problem with the Fair Labor Standards Act is

21

that this whole notion of trying to find an analogy, as

22

difficult as that notion is, and it is a difficult notion,

23

it seems to me that it's premised on the concept that you

24

want to find an analogous statute because if you find an

25

analogous statute there is some thought that the Congress

1

may have balanced the same sorts of interests.

2

that - - otherwise it makes no sense to look for an

3

analogy.
QUESTION:

4

I mean,

Well, maybe the thought is cruder

5

than that.

6

long enough, so Congress may simply be assumed to assume

7

that we will follow the rule that we look for the analogy,

8

and if the analogy is there, that's the end of it.
MR. FEIRSON:

9
10

Maybe the thought is, we've been saying this

But we have to define what we mean

by analogy, and -QUESTION:

11

Yes, and a moment ago you were

12

avoiding the analogy by referring to it as back pay.

13

Another way of characterizing it is simply to say, under

14

WARN you've got to go on paying for 60 days after you give

15

the notice, and if you give notice in time, you're going

16

to get 60 days of work out of that.
If you don't give notice in time, you may not

17
18

get the 60 days of work, but you've still got to give 60

19

days of pay, so instead of being a back pay kind of

20

statute, what it is, is in effect a guarantee of work or

21

payment in the absence of work, and so it's not like a

22

back pay statute, it's like a statute guaranteeing the

23

payment of wages, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wage Collection

24

Act.

3

People work.

The

If they're not earned in this case,

4

it's because the employer does not give the notice, so

5

that if in fact the employer says, well, this case does

6

not cry out for the same treatment, it is only because the

7

employer has violated the statute, and that's why it

8

doesn't cry out for the same treatment.

Indeed, it cries

out for at least as equitable a treatment.
MR. FEIRSON:

10

It's not -- with all due respect,

11

it's not necessarily linked to whether folks work or don't

work.

So that, it is a difference

between a statute which says workers are entitled to get

statute, a notice statute which says to an employer, if

you don't give notice you have to pay damages, and we're

QUESTION:

That's one of the elements

Under Pennsylvania law, suppose it's

a disciplinary layoff.

We had a case like that last year.

13

The employer says, you go - - for 10 days you're

suspended, and the employee then wins that case, wouldn't

15

there be a claim under the guarantee, the wage State law

to say that my wages - - at least there are some State

laws, we had one last year, that covered precisely that

18

situation.
MR. FEIRSON:

19

The Pennsylvania law would not

20

cover that situation, would not give the employee wages

21

for that period of suspension.
QUESTION:

22

Well, what would?

Is there no State

23

law remedy if -- this is a wrongful layoff for discipline.

24

Is there no State law claim that such an employee would

have?

Let's assume for a moment that

it's not a union employee with a just cause clause in the

collective bargaining agreement, because if it was a union

employee with such a clause, they could file a grievance

and they could get paid for that.

Let's assume a nonunion employee, Pennsylvania's

is an employee -- an employment-at-will State, and in that

particular setting, the -- what the court would say is

include sort of these wrongful, either discharge or

wrongful suspension notions, but they're.relatively rare.

MR. FEIRSON:

1

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,

2

but again, conceptually that would be a damage provision.

3

It might come within the statute, but it's different.

4

The basis of the Pennsylvania wage payment and

5

collection law and the Fair Labor Standards Act, putting

6

the penalty provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act to

7

one side for a moment, is the employees have earned this

8

money.

9

They've worked for it and they haven't been paid

10

it, and so these statutes give the employees the right to

11

get the money they have actually earned by virtue of their

12

labors, and that is different from the WARN act, which is

13

a notice statute.

14

The reason why the National Labor Relations Act

15

at least seems to us to be much more analogous is it has

16

as an overlay -- admittedly it's a fairly narrow band, but

17

it has as an overlay this notice right, and when -- if the

18

Court goes to look for an analogy, it seems to us that the

19

analogy the Court ought to be looking for is a notice

20

statute, because it is --

21

QUESTION:

Do I understand correctly the law

22

that if we say your argument is plausible, and then you

23

say the analogy to the State guaranteed wage payment law

24

or to the Fair Labor Standards, those are also plausible,

As long as this Court continues to

adhere to the presumption that State law borrowing ought

to be favored, that is correct.
QUESTION:

9

10

ultimate arguments is maybe we shouldn't have that

presumption.
MR. FEIRSON:

frankly.

19

QUESTION:

Is that in part because we now have

many more Federal statutes from which to borrow?
MR. FEIRSON:

It is in part because of that, it

20

is in part because the enunciated basis underlying the

21

presumption is that Congress looks at what this Court

22

does, and in the past when Congress looked at what this

23

Court did it saw that it always borrowed from the State,

24

and so when Congress didn't put a statute of limitations

25

into a Federal statute, you should assume that the

2

Congress assumed there would be State law borrowing.
Given what's happened in the last 12 years, not

3

only the decisions in this Court in DelCostello and agency

holdings and Lampf, but also the fact that in 1990

5

Congress itself decided that it didn't much like State law

6

borrowing, at least prospectively, to sit here today and

7

say, geez, there's a lot of vitality to this State law

9

QUESTION:

But shouldn't the very change in 1990

10

make us cautious to -- for this -- from now on there's

shouldn't that make us very cautious about reaching back

regime was?

15

MR. FEIRSON:

It's 4 years.

So

The legislative history behind the

16

1990 enactment suggests that the reason why the Congress

17

didn't make that retroactive was because it didn't wish to

upset settled expectations with respect to statutes of

limitations.

1

about settled expectations, they were talking about the

2

fact that for numerous Federal statutes over the years

3

there had become settled expectations as to what the

4

statute of limitations ought to be, and to apply the 1990

5

act retroactively would be to say, for example in the

6

Lampf case in theory you have 1 in 3 years.

7

And people are now out there and have been for,

8

that's a relatively short period, for 3 or 4 years

9

operating on a 1 and 3-year assumption if -- of course, it

10

was passed in '90 so this is not a good analogy, but you

11

wouldn't want to go back and undo that, because there are

12

settled expectations about what the statute should be, and

13

so that's the reason they didn't make it retroactive.

14

That's not to say that because they didn't make

15

it retroactive that doesn't mean that Congress didn't

16

understand that we'd continue along on this borrowing

17

course, but it does seem to me to suggest that Congress

18

was aware of what the tests were that had been enunciated

19

by this Court in the decisions prior to 1990.

20

In fact, there's a -- I don't think you can call

21

it more than a snippet of legislative history, but there

22

is a snippet of legislative history in one of the House

It doesn't seem to incorporate any type of

presumption in favor of State law borrowing.
QUESTION:

3

But is there -- that's what I wonder.

4

I mean, isn't there another reason for State law, that

5

it's sort of like the civil code?
I mean, States tend to have categories of

6

things.

They have sort of -- statute of limitations apply

8

to dozens of statutes like the civil code does, and

9

they're in the business of trying to categorize is this

10

more like a tort, is this more like a contract, is it the

11

civil code or the penal code or which code.
Well, the Federal Government just isn't like

12

13

that, and so initially you'd have a much harder time if

14

you throw every statute of limitations up for grabs.

15

Rather, we look to the civil code --we look to the State

originally, you see, because that was their business,

applying statutes of limitations from the State to Federal

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GOLD:

4
5
6

Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
If I could begin with DelCostello, it seems to

7

me helpful to do so.

As Justice Ginsburg pointed out,

8

DelCostello was not simply a situation dealing with

9

abstractions.

The choice that was seen there in

10

determining how to deal with those hybrid suit challenges

11

to arbitration awards or grievance settlements was

12

somewhere between 20 days, 3 months, 6 months, and

13

9 months, and the Court was very concerned in reaching its

14

eventual conclusion to look at the range of choices that

15

were suggested as clear analogies in both the State and

16

Federal level.

17

Here, we're dealing with a mandatory wage

18

standard or labor standard statute that generates a quite

19

straightforward damage action for failures to act, and

20

only a straightforward court damage action.

21

22

23

QUESTION:

Why does the union have standing to

challenge it, Mr. Gold?
MR. GOLD:

The statute is quite clear in giving

24

the union standing, associational standing to seek such

25

liability, and that is the basis.

We believe that

Congress in this kind of situation plainly has the

2

constitutional authority to provide such associational

3

standing.

4

I have a dual obligation, however.

I'm also

5

here on behalf of the North Star plaintiffs who were

6

unrepresented, and obviously in that case you have an

action by a group of individuals, each of whom plainly has

8

standing to pursue the remedy that is provided, the

monetary remedy provided to them.

11

waivable, that the standing issue is not one that to this

12

point has been pursued.

13

petition some day.

14

It may well be the subject of a

In terms of the kind of situation we have here,

15

it seems to us that it's important to note two things.

16

One, while the petitioners go back and forth, there is a

17

norm, a Federal rule, and the norm is that State statutes

18

are borrowed unless that would frustrate Federal policy or

19

is at odds with the purpose or operation of the Federal

20

law.

21

And secondly, that as I've indicated, this kind

22

of cause of action for failure to provide wages, to

23

provide employment, payment for employment or employment

24

forgone, is a quite straightforward claim of the kind that

25

the law has dealt with and that State law deals with

normally by a range of statute of limitations which

2

balance the needs of the plaintiff and the interests of

3

the law and the needs of the defendant in an area of 2 to

4

4 or 5 years.

5

that were suggested here would provide.

6

That's what the gamut of State statutes

So far as we are aware, and so far as the

7

petitioners have shown, a State law with a 6-month statute

8

of limitation for this kind of employee claim is all but

9

unheard of.

10

Secondly, we believe that the law in this Court

11

is far more stable than the petitioners have suggested.

12

Their argument in our view is really a one-case argument.

13

It's Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff, the RICO case.

14

Aside from that, this Court has two lines of

15

authority, one, State law applies, two, with regard to

16

implied or common law causes of action that come out of or

17

are brigaded with a Federal statute which has an express

18

statute of limitation, the Federal law provides the rule.

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold suppose that the

20

Pennsylvania, or a State statute in a case involving WARN

21

is really, we think, on all fours with, say, the Fair

Federal statute?

2

MR. GOLD:

Your Honor --

3

QUESTION:

Under our existing jurisprudence.

4

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

We noted at the end of our

5

brief as a final argument that if there was a Federal law

6

borrowing rule, if you looked at all possible analogies,

7

the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Portal- to-Portal Act

8

are very, very close analogies indeed.

9

I think that the problem is that the petitioners

10

are awfully cavalier about the unsettling effect of such a

11

change on the decided cases.

12

back to a regime of prospective overruling, the cases, the

3

983 cases, the other cases would have to be revisited if

4

you were to change from a State law presumption with these

5

narrow exceptions to a Federal borrowing regime in

6

general.

7

QUESTION:

Except if you're going to go

The fact that there is a Federal

8

statute that parallels, say, most of the State statutes

9

from which we would borrow would not be, say, special

20
2

exception for escaping from our presumption?
MR. GOLD:

If that could be done, I am not here

22

to argue for the overall virtue of State borrowing.

If we

23

were at square

24

the balance of interest and policies looks to the balance

25

of interest that goes into statutes of limitation, not, as

, our only interest is that the search for

petitioners would have it, looking for a norm somewhere,

2

anywhere, that looks like this norm without regard to what

3

kind of enforcement system or what the purposes and

4

policies behind the norm would be.

5

So I could not argue to you that the State law

6

presumption or basic borrowing rule is of the essence to

7

Federal jurisprudence.

8

it has been established by this Court as the norm.

9

read into Federal statutes as the intent of Congress

I would only argue that it is -It is

10

except in narrow circumstances, and it produces rational

11

statutes of limitations in this context whereas the

12

suggestion of NLRA borrowing does not.

13

Beyond that, I can only say, as has been pointed

14

out, that we're dealing with a wasting resource here.

15

Starting for any statute after 1990 there is now a

16

residual Federal rule, and against that background the

17

question of revising the basic standard and unsettling

18

those matters which have been settled, some of which drive

19

a great deal of litigation like 1981 and 1983, may be a

20

higher cost than is warranted in this case, where the

21

State statutes really are very close to the most analogous

22

Federal statute, which is the Fair Labor Standards Act.

23

QUESTION:

Could we say, what's essential to

your position in this case is that we reject the 6-month

Right, and I do think that when we

6

have the discussion of the kind we do here about forum

7

shopping and complexities, lawyers and clients should read

8

the law books and do know the basic statute of

9

limitations, and it is the rare case, one hopes, that

10
11
12

3
4

these nice questions of perfect characterization come up.
That doesn't mean this Court can avoid those
nice questions, but the essential point is precisely the
one you've made, Justice Ginsburg.
From our perspective, when you look at this kind

5

of claim, we ought to be found to have brought this WARN

6

act case timely in just over a year, no matter whether

7

it's a State borrowing rule or a Federal borrowing rule.

8
9

The NLRA analogy just doesn't fit because as
this Court pointed out in Reed, and it would seem to us

20

that it's difficult to come up with two cases that are

21

closer in terms of a conceptual question of when you go to

22

NLRA borrowing than this case and Reed, the fact that

23

there is an overlap between the NLRA norm and another

24

Federal statutory norm is not decisive.

25

this Court means when it talks about looking to the

That isn't what

1

policies and purposes of the statute.
8(b)(l)a of the National Labor Relations Act

2

3
4

covers a far greater fraction of Landrum Griffin title I
0

cases than the NLRA provisions cover with regard to

5

WARN, and Reed quite rightly says that that isn't the

6

test, the test is the policies that are peculiarly

7

relevant to determining the proper statute of limitations.

8

9

The NLRA statute, as this Court explained in
DelCostello and again in Reed, is a statute of limitation

10

that has to do with protecting the formation and operation

11

of collective bargaining agreements and private settlement

12

through grievance arbitration, and to furthering stable

3
4

ongoing bargaining relationships.
It's not easy for me to face up to this in

5

argument, but somewhere between 75 percent and 85 percent

6

of the people covered by the WARN act are not governed by

7

any collective bargaining relationship.

8

the WARN act is to give those people not a chance to work

9

out a private settlement, as Justice Kennedy has already

20

pointed out, but an opportunity to adjust and retrain by

2

having sufficient notice, and we haven't even mentioned

22

the fact that the WARN act generates a notice to the

23

affected community, which is so far removed from any

24

conception of the NLRA as to have lost all touch with it.

25

The purpose of

The fact of the matter is, as this Court has

1

recognized, albeit in the preemption context, but equally

2

to the point here, that they're two very different classes

3

of labor legislation, labor standards legislation which

4

redounds to the benefit of all employees and sets norms

5

that are nonwaivable, and are the product of the rules of

6

the State, and the collective bargaining system, which

7

aims to add a layer of protection and to forster a private

8

resolution system.

9

The WARN act, like the Fair Labor Standards Act,

10

like the Portal- to-Portal Act which is referred to in the

11

legislative history here, is a labor standards statute

12

which generates the kind of court litigation which has

13

always been -- for damages, which has always been covered

14

in the range of situations by statutes of limitation of 2

15

to 4 years, not the kind of statute of limitation in the

16

NLRA which has a particular private agreement, private

17

resolution system in mind.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

22

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

23

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

24
25

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

1

I'd like to begin by touching briefly on two

2

observations which have been alluded to in the earlier

3

portions of the argument but that I think are especially

4

crucial to the disposition of this case, and the first is

5

that in determining whether the NLRA and the WARN act are

6

analogous for purposes of limitations borrowing, the

7

question is not whether the similarities between the

8

statutes outnumber the dissimilarities, but as Mr. Gold

9

has mentioned, the question is whether the statutes are

10

similar with respect to those features which would be

11

especially relevant to the choice of an appropriate

12

limitations period.

3

And then the second point I'd like to allude to

4

is one that Justice Ginsburg mentioned.

5

simply coincidence or a fluke in this case that the

6

actions filed would be timely under all of the statutes of

7

limitations proposed except for that afforded by the NLRA.

8
9

That is, it's not

Statutes on the order of 2 to 3 to 4 years are
far more typical with respect to the filing of civil

20

actions than is the 6-month period established by section

21

0(b), and I think that should lead the Court to conclude

22

that there were some fairly unusual factors at work that

23

led Congress to adopt the

24

the question is whether those factors are present in WARN

25

act suits as well.

0(b) limitations period, and

1

And I think the two crucial factors are first,

2

as Mr. Gold mentioned, section

3

is particularly concerned not with labor law in general,

4

but with the process of collective bargaining and private

5

dispute resolution under the terms of a CBA, and I think

6

the contrast between DelCostello and Reed is telling.

7

0(b), the NLRA generally

This Court borrowed the NLRA, the section

0(b)

8

limitations period when it was dealing with a case that

9

implicated private dispute resolution under the collective

10

bargaining agreement.

In Reed it was dealing with the

11

general field of labor law.

12

area in which some of the primary conduct prohibited by

It was even dealing with an

3

title I was also an unfair labor practice under the NLRA,

4

but the Court said in Reed that because the case did not

5

touch upon the formation of the collective bargaining

6

agreements or the private resolution of disputes

7

thereunder, borrowing of the

8

inappropriate.

9

0(b) limitations period was

I think the second point that's crucial in

20

determining why 6 months is appropriate in the NLRA

21

context is that the filing of an unfair labor practice

22

charge requires simply the filing of a charge with an

23

administrative body.

24

for determining whether a complaint should be filed, and

25

for prosecuting a complaint if one is pursued, and by

The NLRB then takes responsibility

1

contrast, a situation in which the responsibility is

2

entirely upon the private litigant to file suit in Federal

3

district court,

4

period is less appropriate.

5

the choice of such a short limitations

We recognize from DelCostello that we can't make

6

the argument that borrowing a limitations period

7

established for a limitations charge is never appropriate

8

for filing a suit in court, because DelCostello held that

9

sometimes it was, but I think if we look at the body of

10

Federal employment statutes generally, we see a pretty

11

clear pattern.

12

Those statutes like the NLRA,

title VII, the

3

ADEA, which require a litigant to proceed by filing an

4

administrative charge,

5

so on the order of 3 to 6 months.

6

such as the Fair Labor Standards Act,

7

pay act, which require a litigant to proceed by filing a

8

suit in court, typically contain a limitations period on

9

the order of 2 to 3 years, and I think this body of law

typically contain periods for doing
Statutes, by contrast,
the Portal- to-Portal

20

reflects a congressional judgment that typically a

2

litigant should have more time when the responsibility is

22

entirely upon him to pursue his claim by means of filing a

23

judicial action.

24
25

The final thing I'd just like to touch upon, as
Mr. Gold said,

is that we think that the Court's
38

1

presumption of Sate law borrowing has worked well.
We think that borrowing State law in this

2

3

context would not create problems of disuniformity and

4

unpredictability that are so extreme as to outweigh the

5

presumption, but if the Court was particularly concerned

6

with uniformity, we think that there are better ways of

7

accomplishing that than by borrowing the NLRA statute of

8

limitation, such as borrowing the limitations period in

9

the Portal- to-Portal pay act, or establishing a generic

10

characterization of WARN act claims that would apply in

11

all States.

12

Thank you, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, may I just ask one

15

question?

16

judgment below in its present State, or should we send it

17

back to the court and say, pick a particular statute?

18

Shouldn't -- it's true, this case is going to be -- this

19

case on that assumption would be upheld no matter which of

20

the Pennsylvania statutes might apply, but shouldn't --

21

for the future, shouldn't there be a clear rule down in

22

the Federal courts there?

23

Assuming we agree with you, should we leave the

MR. STEWART:

Well, I -- with respect, I don't

24

think it would - - that the proper disposition for this

25

Court would be to send it back to the court of appeals and

1

ask them to pick a statute.
That is, for the sake of predictability the

2

3

Court obviously doesn't grant cert in a large number of

4

cases, and when it does so, it typically wants to

5

establish rules that will guide a lot of lower courts, so

6

it might be appropriate for this Court to pick the proper

7

rule.
But if this Court decides that it doesn't want

8

9

to do that, then I think the proper disposition would

10

simply be to say that suit would be timely under any of

11

the plausible limitations periods, and leave it at that.

12

I don't see a value that would be served if this Court

13

didn't make the choice, but asked the court of appeals to

14

do so.

Mr. Feirson, you have a minute remaining.

17

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN B. FEIRSON

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19

Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

MR. FEIRSON:

Quickly, I think it's important

20

first to note that when we talk about a 6-month statute

21

with respect to the WARN act, frequently it's going to be

22

a lot more than 6 months.

23

24
25

It's only 6 months if there's

Otherwise, in the more complicated situations
that have been referred to - - for example, mass layoff

situations -- there has to be a 6-month period of
employment loss before the right accrues, so that in
essence an employee may have as much as a year before they
have to file suit.

That's number 1.

With respect to title VII being an
administrative agency and having 6 months to file and you
don't have to bring a lawsuit, you do have to bring a
lawsuit within 90 days of receiving your right-to-sue
letter from the EEOC, so that within the employment laws
there are a lot of short limitations periods.
And finally - QUESTION:

You've had your administrative toils,

and you've had at least some guidance about what to do.
You haven't -- you're just not out there alone.
MR. FEIRSON:

Sometimes you are out there alone

if it's the Equal Employment Opportunity -QUESTION:
the EEOC.

To do that you have to go first to

Here, the employee on your version would have

to go directly into Federal court, not having gotten any
guidance, any counseling, any aid from any administrative
agency.
MR. FEIRSON:

But if -- in both situations,

whether you go to the administrative agency or you go to a
lawyer to file suit, the critical -- it seems to me the
critical issue in a statute of limitations context is when
