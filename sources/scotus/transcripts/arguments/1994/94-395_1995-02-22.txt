ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
A person whose property has become entangled in

11

Government efforts to collect taxes owed by someone else

12

has a broad variety of remedies.

13

challenge the Government collection action in a wrongful

14

levy, a quiet title, or a foreclosure proceeding, and may

15

obtain a release of the Federal lien if they want to make

16

an immediate sale by providing substitute collateral from

17

the proceeds of the sale.

18

The nontaxpayer may

Historically, however, nontaxpayers have not

19

been permitted simply to pay the tax and sue for a refund.

20

The collateral litigation of tax obligations by

21

nontaxpayers would present a quagmire of problems that the

22

courts and Congress have not traditionally sanctioned.

23

In this case, however, the Ninth Circuit held

24

that a nontaxpayer whose property became subject to a lien

25

that arose from someone else's obligations may simply pay

the tax, even though she admittedly didn't owe it, and sue

2

for a refund.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, do you concede that the

4

lien was improper because at the time notice of it was

5

given the person who allegedly had incurred the tax

6

liability was not the owner of the property?

7

MR. JONES:

No, Justice Ginsburg, we don't

8

concede that.

Indeed, the facts reflect that the lien

9

would have been valid as against the nontaxpayer because

10

she took the property from her husband without qualifying

11

as a purchaser.

12

without paying what the statute requires, full and

13

adequate consideration in money or money's worth.

14
15

She took the property from her husband

QUESTION:

I thought that was conceded, or that

was the premise of the decision below, was it not?

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

Not -- not quite.

Just as a matter of chronology, is it

20

not so that the notice of lien was filed some weeks after

21

the property was transferred?

22

MR. JONES:

After the transfer, and our point

23

with respect to that is that the notice of lien is not

24

needed to be valid as against a person who took the

25

property without qualifying as a purchaser, under 6323 of

The respondent in this case -QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

But you say you don't have to

That issue hasn't been reached by

either of the courts below, because this issue -- the case

has been decided solely on jurisdictional grounds.

statute.

QUESTION:

If the Court thinks there's no
If the Court

Well, Mr. Jones, 1346 confers

jurisdiction on the district courts.

Yes.

QUESTION:

1

2

-- to waive sovereign immunity.

Where do we find that?
MR. JONES:

3

The short answer to that question is

4

that the waiver of immunity for a claim that would fall

5

within 1346(a)(1) is in section 7422(f) of the Internal

6

Revenue Code.
QUESTION:

of limitations.
MR. JONES:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. JONES:

No, sir, 7422(f)

--

(f).
-- is a statute that says that a

claim of the type permitted by 7422(a)

13

complicated.

14

7422(f) says that a claim of the type permitted by 7422(a)

15

must be brought against the United States rather than the

16

district director, who used to be the collector.

17

will recall, at common law these tax refund suits could

18

not be brought against the United States.

19

brought against the collector.

I just want to say that at the outset.

MR. JONES:

I believe that's correct.

24

to a tax question.

1

rationale of the court below and why we think it's wrong.
The court said that the simple language of

2

3

1346(a)(1) says that a suit may be brought against the

4

United States for the recovery of any tax illegally or

5

erroneously assessed or collected.

6

plain language says that if you're alleging that the tax

7

is illegally assessed or erroneously collected, you can

8

proceed.

9

The court said the

The central premise of that analysis is that it

10

is appropriate to view 1346(a)(1) in complete isolation

11

from any other provision of the code, and this Court has

12

twice rejected that very contention in the Flora case and

13

again most recently in United States v. Dalm.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, would you go back in time

15

with me before there were those later provisions?

16

understand it, 1346(a) has been with us since, what, 1911?

And the other provisions, the

subsequent -MR. JONES:

The provision that this Court held

21

in Dalm modifies 1346(a)(1) is 1724(a) of the Internal

22

Revenue Code.

23

enacted in 1878.

24

1346(a)(1) was drawn when jurisdiction was first provided

for suits against the United States.

1

Before jurisdiction was provided for suits

2

against the United States for tax refunds, 7422(a) of the

3

code had already been in existence for almost 50 years.

4

QUESTION:

But the language of 1346(a) and 7422

5

are matching, and neither or those use the word

6

"taxpayer."

7

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

No, they -So the critical statute you're

relying on is not either one of

those.

It is, in fact, 7422(a).

7244(a)

11

says that any claim for refund must first be filed with

12

the Secretary of the Treasury before it may be maintained

13

in any court.

14

In Dalm, the Court concluded that's a

15

jurisdictional limit.

16

jurisdiction that coexists with 1346 -- you have to read

17

these together -- and the Court further said in Dalm that

18

to decide what that meant you have to file the claim for

19

refund with the Secretary of the Treasury.

to 6511 of the code.

The language in 7422 of the code

They're the same, and they don't refer to

MR. JONES:

That's absolutely right, but 74 --

our point is that 7422(a) requires that there be a refund

claim filed in accordance with law.

11

claim, a refund claim filed with the Secretary in

12

accordance with law, and I'm making the same point that

13

the Court made in deciding the Dalm case, that you have to

14

then go to 6511 to see what that means.

15

QUESTION:

Not just a refund

But I don't think 6511 provides what

16

you say it provides, because 6511 it seems to me doesn't

17

provide anything more than the fact that a claim for

18

credit or refund of a tax with respect to which the

19

taxpayer is required to file a return shall be filed by

20

the taxpayer within certain periods.

address the question of a refund which is claimed by

someone who was not required to file a return as a

taxpayer in the first place.

QUESTION:

The taxpayer is required to file

Well, it applies whether or not a

return was filed.

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

Right.
But isn't it conditioned upon the

8

requirement of filing by the taxpayer when the taxpayer is

the claimant?

QUESTION:

There seems to be a condition that limits the

17

application of this to refunds by a taxpayer who was

18

required to file a return, and it doesn't seem to speak to

19

the situation we've got here.
MR. JONES:

20

I'm sorry, I don't believe that's

21

correct, because if you read on, at page 3 of our brief we

22

quote this provision.

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

says,

Yes.
And the last clause of that sentence

QUESTION:

If no return was filed by the

taxpayer --

3

MR. JONES:

4

QUESTION:

And that --- but here, her claim is, I am not a

5

taxpayer within the meaning of the statute, because I was

6

never required to file a return as to the taxes you are

7

ultimately collecting.

8

9

MR. JONES:

Well, she can't qualify as a

taxpayer under the code.

However, you parse the last

10

clause, and I just respectfully disagree in terms of how

11

that language parses.

12

understood -- and when I say always, except for the Martin

13

case and this case -- is that a taxpayer must make the

14

administrative refund claim, and that only -- and the term

15

"taxpayer" is defined in section 7701 of the code to mean

16

the person subject to the tax.

QUESTION:

The way it has always been

It is a --

Mr. Jones, always understood, that's

hardly universal.
There's one well -- widely used *Verna and Kafka

Litigation of Federal Tax Controversies that

21

states -- this is from the 1986 issue -- that a third

22

party who pays the taxes of another under duress may

23

recover the amount paid even if the taxpayer owes the

24

deficiency, and in determining whether payment has been

25

made under duress, the courts have examined the coercive

circumstances that prompted the payment and the lack of

alternatives available to the payor.

That's a widely used manual.

5

Government, but how can you say it was generally

MR. JONES:

It's certainly not

I would respectfully disagree with

that treatise's description of the law.
QUESTION:

9

There are --

You may very well disagree with it,

10

but you can't say until this case, it was generally

11

understood that.

12

MR. JONES:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. JONES:

I think I -You can say it was debatable.
Well, whether it was debatable or

15

not, the way we understand the cases is as follows.

16

case that has actually addressed the question of whether a

17

nontaxpayer may bring a refund suit has said no.

18

are two lines of authority that follow along that same

19

principle.

20

Every

There

One line of authority is the Parsons v. Anglim

21

type case, where the person who paid the tax did so under

22

what the Court said was a reasonable assumption, or a

23

reasonable belief that the Government was taking the

24

position she was the taxpayer.

25

come in the court and say, well, I paid the tax because

Obviously, a person can

1

you claimed it was due from me, but I don't think I owe

2

it.

3

That's one line of authority.

I'm not really the taxpayer.

4

I don't owe this tax.

The other line of authority are the kinds of

5

cases like Stewart v. Chinese Chamber of Commerce, which

6

is cited in the Phillips decision in the Second Circuit,

7

and in that case the court says a nontaxpayer cannot bring

8

a refund suit, but what they can do -- and this may relate

9

to the point that you just raised, Justice Ginsburg --

10

what they can do is that before

11

collector, the district director, to recover property that

12

the district director had taken to pay someone else's

3

966 they could sue the

taxes.

4

Now, in the First National Bank of *Amlinton

5

case, which we cite in our brief simply as the First

6

National Bank case, it's the Third Circuit case, the Court

7

explains the limit on that branch, if you will, of

8

authority to recover property, and that is that once the

9

Government has sold the property and the money has been

20

deposited in the Government's Treasury, that avenue of

21

jurisdiction doesn't exist, because then it would be a

22

suit against the United States for a refund.

So I don't have the treatise that was in front

QUESTION:

1

I just brought it up because of your

2

statement that until this case it was generally

3

understood, and I think it's not generally understood.

4

MR. JONES:

I think that it -- I would go so far

5

as to say I submit that it is perfectly accurate to say

6

that other than the two lines of decisions that I just

7

described, every court that has addressed this subject

8

has said, other than Martin and the current decision, has

9

said that the -- a nontaxpayer may not sue for a refund.
QUESTION:

10
11

What has been the basis of those

courts' position?
MR. JONES:

12

There have been a variety of bases.

13

The Federal Court of Claims in the Economy Plumbing &

14

Heating case applied the reasoning that I have described,

15

which is -- and the Court's reasoning in Dalm, which is,

16

you have to read these statutes together.

17

As this Court said in Flora, in making the very

18

point that you could not read 1346(a)(1) in isolation, and

19

I'll quote the Court:

20

single sentence in an isolated statute, but with a

21

jurisdictional provision which is a keystone of a

22

carefully articulated and quite complicated structure of

23

tax laws.

QUESTION:

we are not here concerned with a

structure do they derive the principle that a nontaxpayer

MR. JONES:

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

4

Now, did this taxpayer file an

administrative claim for refund first?

5

Yes.

MR. JONES:

I thought she did.

She filed an administrative claim

for refund, but she is not the person who is the taxpayer.

7

QUESTION:

But she was in effect compelled by

8

the Government to do something because the lien had been

9

slapped on the house and she was trying to sell it, and

there is a degree of Government compulsion.

14

It's not like

This is someone who had a lot of pressure put on

MR. JONES:

The statutory structure that I've

15

described wasn't the result of historical happenstance.

16

Congress has long been aware that nontaxpayers cannot sue

17

for a refund under these provisions, and instead of

18

providing jurisdiction for nontaxpayers to sue for a

19

refund, they provided a wholly separate set of remedies

20

directly addressed to the problems that nontaxpayers face.
Two of those remedies are particularly relevant

to this case.

concern.

MR. PANITZ:

The Government in essence is

2

arguing that it doesn't matter, because the Government's

3

argument is that she's not the taxpayer, that she has no

4

jurisdiction to sue, so whether or not their collection

5

was erroneous or not is really irrelevant, according to

6

their argument.

7

The Government makes this convoluted argument

8

about the statutory scheme.

We are not arguing with the

9

statutory scheme in this case.

We agree that the Internal

10

Revenue Code provisions are pertinent and do apply, as

11

this Court ruled in Dalm and also in Flora.

12

However, the Government blurs the statutory

13

scheme in this case.

14

independent statute and seeing what the purpose was, both

15

as a matter of law and as a matter of tax policy, they

16

instead blur them all together and say, this prevents the

17

petitioner in this case to sue, simply because 6511, which

18

is a procedural statute of limitations, has the word

19

"taxpayer" in it, yet section 7422, which is the cause of

20

action section, does not have the word "taxpayer" in it.

Rather than looking at each
