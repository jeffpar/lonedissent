CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 94-514, the United States v. Michael Gaudin.

Is that the way your client pronounces his name?

MR. HANSEN:

It is, Your Honor, Mr. Chief

Justice.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

11
12

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether the issue

13

of materiality in a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 is an

14

issue of law for the court or an issue of fact for the

15

jury to decide.

16

The Ninth Circuit held in its en banc decision

17

in this case that materiality presents a factual matter

18

that must be decided by the jury under this Court's due

19

process and Sixth Amendment decisions.

20

disagreed with the holding of every other regional court

21

of appeals that had considered the question, as well as

22

this Court's decision under an analogous statute under

23

Sinclair v. United States.

24
25

In so holding, it

The Ninth Circuit's holding is incorrect for
three reasons.

First, this Court's decision in Sinclair

1

and its more recent decision in Kungys v. United States

2

establish that the issue of materiality in a prosecution

3

for making false statements to a Government body is a

4

legal issue and, as such, it is properly a matter for the

5

court to resolve.
Second, the classification of materiality as an

6

7

issue of law has deep historical roots in the law of

8

perjury, and that law has always recognized that the

9

question of whether a particular false statement is

10

material raises a question of law for decision by the

11

courts.

12

question of the propriety and constitutionality of

13

deciding materiality by the court.

14

That long history is critical in resolving the

QUESTION:

If you were deciding it as an

15

original proposition it would make sense to say it was a

16

mixed question of law and fact, wouldn't it?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that it might make sense

18

in some cases to describe it as a mixed question of law

19

and fact, Justice O'Connor, but the question of what kinds

20

of facts need to be determined either in a perjury or a

21

prosecution under 1001 is very different from the kinds of

22

historical facts that we usually associate with a jury

23

determination such as, did the defendant do it, and what

24

his intent was.

25

In a perjury case, the kinds of considerations

that come to bear are, what were the issues in the prior

2

trial, and what was the transcript of evidence before the

3

finder of fact in the prior trial.

4

matters are not really the kind of thing that call for a

5

jury to sort out conflicting evidence, except perhaps in

6

the rare case which arose in the

7

8

decision made about what the defendant actually said and

what was at issue in a particular trial.

MR. DREEBEN:

In a normal

prosecution the

7

ultimate question that the court is asking is, would the

8

particular misstatement have the capability of affecting

9

the decision of the agency, and the proposition to be

20

established is, what are the agency's functions as a

2

matter of law, what is it authorized to carry out and, in

22

some cases, it may go down to a somewhat more refined

23

policy level of what is the agency actually trying to do

24

within the broad scope of its statutory mandate?

25

Certainly the question of what the agency is

2

question.

3

sometimes of regulations, perhaps of legislative history,

4

but those are all materials that a court deals with as a

5

matter of law.

6

It requires the consultation of statutes,

QUESTION:

Now, in this case the trial court

7

held a hearing to determine what effect the agency

8

officials give to these applications?

9
10
11

12

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I don't think in this case the

judge held a hearing on that.
There was testimony at the trial, more along the
lines of the testimony that Justice O'Connor was

3

describing, testimony about would the false statements on

4

the HUD forms in question have affected the agency's

5

decision to make a loan, that all came in at trial, and

6

the judge then instructed the jury before the jury got the

7

case that the issue of materiality was for the court to

8

resolve as one of law, and there was no debate that I have

9

seen in the transcript about whether the materiality

20
21
22

23

element was satisfied in this case.
QUESTION:

It doesn't --

In your view, was that testimony

significant in helping the judge form his conclusion?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I don't know, since the

24

judge didn't write an opinion.

25

informed his decision in the matter, although there were

1

other ways that materiality could have been proved in this

2

case, but our position --

3

QUESTION:

It seems to me that if I were the

4

trial judge in this case I wouldn't have had the slightest

5

idea of how these forms worked, and that I would have

6

wanted to hear the testimony, and that indicates that it's

7

something that I don't know much about as a matter of law,

8

and that is a jury question.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think that it indicates

10

that the details of any particular program are something

11

that needs to be established to the satisfaction of the

12

court that's hearing the particular case, but that alone,

13

in our view, isn't enough to treat the issue as one that

14

must be resolved by the jury.

15

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that it might have

16

been proper in a case like this for the judge to hold a

17

hearing outside the presence of the jury in order to make

18

his determination, or her determination, whether or not

19

the agency would reasonably rely on these matters, whether

20

or not it would be material?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the judge could have held a

22

hearing outside the hearing of the jury.

question about that.

QUESTION:

-- other kind of criminal case?

2

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, it does occur in this kind of

3

case as well as in a perjury case where judges want to

4

decide the issue of materiality and for one reason or

5

another the evidence isn't admissible in the case in

6

chief, so that a hearing outside the presence of the jury

7

would be appropriate.

8

10

QUESTION:

Do we do this in any cases where the

issue is something other than materiality?
MR. DREEBEN:

Have --

If there are very many issues like

11

that, there aren't too many of them.

12

where the judge does decide a question that may turn on

13

facts is whether a particular piece of property is within

14

the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, which

15

is a jurisdictional prerequisite as well as an element of

16

many offenses that the United States prosecutes.

17

settled that the court determines whether a particular

18

piece of property is within the territory of the United

19

States, and I think that rule would apply whether the

20

judge was looking at a deed, or whether he was looking at

21

a description of land and needed to hear some evidence

22

about what that land actually entailed, so that is not a

23

totally unknown process.

1

whether a particular piece of information or a particular

2

misstatement is material is something that the court does

3

do.

4

QUESTION:

But Mr. Dreeben, you recognize that

5

in the case of material misrepresentations to a private

6

party, for example in the securities area, that those are

7

regarded as questions for the jury, the materiality of a

8

misrepresentation, say, in a proxy statement.

9
10

MR. DREEBEN:
QUESTION:

We do concede that.

So how -- what is the distinction?

11

Do you just say, whenever it's to a Government agency it's

12

for the judge, and whenever it's to a nongovernmental

3
4

entity it's for the jury, and what's the rhyme or reason?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think that the line that

5

history has drawn is between the materiality of false

6

statements to private parties and the materiality of false

7

statements to Government bodies, and we accept that line

8

as one that has enough basis in reason to survive the

9

question of whether it violates the Due Process Clause of

20
21

the Fifth Amendment.
The basic question in determining the

22

materiality of a false statement to a private party is how

23

a reasonable person would react to that statement, and the

24

question of how reasonable people do things has been in

25

our system one that we've been very comfortable assigning

1

to juries.

2

And it's, of course, assigned to the jury in the

3

negligence context, and there really is an analogy between

4

the reasonable person standard in determining materiality

5

and the reasonable person standard in tort law that

6

justifies certainly that long tradition of having

7

materiality issues decided by the jury when they are to

8

private parties.

When Government bodies are at issue,

contrast,

and I would submit also most of the lower levels, or more

specific levels of analysis, have to do with what that

agency's policies and practices are, which raises a

determination that in many cases is a pure question of

15

law.

the highest level of generality of the question,

16

And even in those cases where it requires some

17

consideration of evidence about what the agency actually

18

does,

19

policies are, which is something that should not be

20

resolved differently in courtroom around the country

21

depending upon whether a particular jury accepts or

22

rejects testimony.

23

the ultimate inquiry focuses on what that agency's

It should rather be resolved on a uniform basis,

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm not making the factual

assumption that every judge would agree, but I do make the

assertion that when a question of law is at issue there is

7

only one right answer to the question that judges should

reach in determining whether an agency would have viewed

10

Well, you could say that as to

11

whether particular acts affect interstate commerce under

12

the Hobbs Act, and that always goes to a jury, doesn't it?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the question of what is

14

proved in a particular case does go to the jury, but I

15

think that judges routinely instruct juries that if

certain facts are found they constitute the requisite

1

substantial potential for disuniformity if you entrust the

2

question of whether an agency would have been capable of

3

being influenced by a particular piece of information to

4

juries.
QUESTION:

5

Yes, but that's an argument against

6

the jury system.

It's not an argument against submitting

7

this issue, is it?

8

the extent that it's true, it could be true of any issue

9

that gets submitted to a jury.

I mean, that -- what you say there, to

MR. DREEBEN:

10

Well, the -- in our system, the

11

threshold question of deciding whether the jury decides a

12

particular issue is how the court system, the judicial

13

system, classifies it as an issue of law or an issue of

14

fact.

15
16

QUESTION:

But that cannot inform our answer,

because that would simply involve us in total circularity.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think it involves the

18

Court in total circularity, Justice Souter.

19

that it does is require the Court to look back into the

20

legal traditions that have always informed the

21

determination of whether a particular issue is factual or

22

legal.

23

QUESTION:

What I think

All right, but if we do that, it

24

seems to me we could say, well, when the materiality issue

25

is simply a strictly relational issue, if it's strictly an

1

issue of relevance, okay, there's a good common law

2

antecedent for saying it is a question of law and nothing

3

but that.

4

But on the basis of your own answer to, first to

5

Justice O'Connor and then I thought to Justice Ginsburg, I

6

think you're saying there's more to it than that, because

7

it seems to me there are two possibilities consistent with

8

your answer.

9

One is that we are looking to what you called

10

policies, which in fact are I guess statements of how the

11

agency does, in fact, treat certain factual material that

12

may come before it, or a second possibility might be that

13

we look to the statutes and we look to the relevant facts,

14

and we ask, in effect, what would a reasonable official

15

with these responsibilities do with these kinds of facts,

16

which gets us into the category that you mentioned of kind

17

of the classic reasonable person tort law concept.

18

In either case, whether we're looking for the

19

actual policy or the policy that a reasonable person would

20

follow, we're doing something more than simply asking a

21

question of the relevance of one proposition to another

22

proposition.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't dispute, Justice Souter,

24

the inquiry of 1001 does involve a bit more than a strict

25

relational inquiry, but I submit that the core of the

1

inquiry is a relational issue, and the determination of

2

what the fact must relate to -- in other words, what the

3

policy actually is -- is in most cases one that can be

4

resolved as a pure question of law, and I don't think that

5

the Court should assume that in the typical 1001 case that

6

the issue is whether some individual agency official

7

sitting in some office can dictate whether the Government

8

values or doesn't value particular information based on

9

his testimony.
QUESTION:

10

Well, that then leaves you with, I

11

suppose, the reasonable official, given the

12

responsibilities that the law imposes.

13

15

MR. DREEBEN:

That is right, and I think that

what - QUESTION:

Why doesn't that, therefore, get you

16

right into the analogy with tort law, reasonable person

17

questions, or classic jury questions?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think certainly what a

19

reasonable person - - a reasonable private person would do

20

is one that tort law has assigned to the jury system, but

21

what a reasonable agency official would do, what a

22

hypothetical reasonable governmental official would do is

23

a categorically different question.

MR. DREEBEN:

But I think just to state that

appropriate determination for a court.

5

interpreting how the law and particular statutes and

Does that take you to

the point of saying that whenever the question is, as

that it must always be reserved by the -- or may

MR. DREEBEN:

Well,

it doesn't, and the reason

16

that I think that the Court doesn't have to make such a

17

sweeping analysis in this case in order to decide it in

18

the Government's favor is that the notion of what

19

constitutes a mixed question of law and fact is one that

20

we commonly use and associate with the standards

21

applicable to appellate review.

22

It's not one that we typically use for sorting

out what questions have to be decided by a jury versus

what questions may be decided by a judge, and as a result,

QUESTION:

Whenever the question before a trial

court is, in the same sense that it is here, one in which

facts about the law as well as facts about the world

outside the law have to be taken into consideration, I

8

take it your position would be, when that is the sense of

the mixed law and fact question, it's always going to be a

question - - it may constitutionally always be a question

reserved for the court?

don't think that I have to go that far.

questions about a defendant's intent in particular

circumstances that could be described as Your Honor has

described them, as bearing on how the defendant saw

particular laws and regulations as bearing on his conduct,

say, in a tax fraud prosecution, and it's not the

Government's position that you could take the ultimate

sounds like what we're talking about here.

kind of a question be one for the court alone?

4

MR. DREEBEN:

Would that - - which
Would that

I don't think so, not in a

5

criminal case, and again, what we are primarily talking

6

about there is the difference between private conduct and

7

the conduct of those people who are agents of and who

8

represent the Government, and we're talking about that

9

against the backdrop of a very long tradition in our law,

10

not only in perjury cases but also in cases that arise

11

under section

00 , which is a fairly broad statute.

QUESTION:

12

Yes, but how long does that -- that

MR. DREEBEN:

9th Century,

Well, the -- as far as we have

6

been able to ascertain from reviewing all of the legal

7

sources available, although the crime of perjury is a very

8

old crime and it has always included an issue of

9

materiality as a prerequisite for conviction, there

20

doesn't seem to have been very much debate on the issue

21

until the

22

9th Century.
In the early part of the

9th Century, courts

23

did address the question and reported decisions, and they

24

resolved it with a uniformity that I think is rather rare

25

in common law and early criminal law decisions by holding

that the issue of materiality is one that judges decide.
QUESTION:

But we would be going a step beyond

that if we hold your way in this case.
MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think that -- I think the

5

step, if the Court has to take a step further, is a very

6

small step indeed, because it was always recognized, as I

7

said, even in the perjury cases, that there might have to

8

be some limited amount of fact-finding to determine what

9

the issues in the prior trial were, and to determine what

10

the testimony is alleged to be, and I think that those

really form analogues to what courts have to do in

QUESTION:

But you don't quarrel with our

resolution of it on the merits.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

In fact, we believe that it

4

would be preferable, from the Government's standpoint, to

5

have this legal issue resolved on its merits because

6

courts are instructing juries quite often on how

7

materiality should be resolved in section 1001

prosecutions.

9

And the Ninth Circuit hinted very strongly that

10

it would be unconstitutional to take materiality from the

11

jury in a perjury prosecution, and we would like to have a

12

uniform national rule that is compatible with what all of

13

the circuits but the Ninth Circuit have said, which is

14

that the court may continue to resolve this issue as a

15

matter of law, and we're not as interested in having a

The primary question here is, is it a
permissible determination under the United States

10

Constitution for legislatures to make the issue of

materiality one resolvable by a court, and our answer to

that is yes, in view of the very long legal tradition that

views that as a question of law.

distinction between issues of law and fact, simply is not

QUESTION:

Does the principle of judicial notice

have any application in criminal cases?
MR. DREEBEN:

It does, to the extent that the

Court is the proper body for resolving the issue.
I don't think that I've seen cases in which

6

courts drew upon judicial notice to instruct the jury as a

7

particular matter, but that might be, Chief Justice

8

Rehnquist, the kind of thing that has a family resemblance

to determining what is the territory of the United States

in a prosecution that depends on proving that a particular

11

crime occurred within the territory of the United States.

12

The jury decides where did this crime occur?

13

The judge instructs the jury based on consulting materials

14

of which he may take judicial notice, I assume, that a

2

issues shall be decided in that light?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think that's the strongest

3

analogy that respondent could have in support of his

4

position, but I would return to three reasons why that is

5

not the path this Court should go down in this case.

6

The first is that the ultimate quarry here, the

7

ultimate object of the materiality inquiry, does depend on

8

a conclusion about what the agency is legally authorized

9

and is doing, and whether a particular piece of

10

information could affect that determination, and I would

11

submit that whether the question of the agency's actions

12

is resolved at the level of explicit statutory direction,

13

less explicit but perhaps embodied in policies, or policy

14

statements, or even testimony by agency officials, it's

15

all the same generic inquiry.

16

agency's legally authorized activities.

It's an inquiry into the

17

The second reason is that I don't believe that

18

kind of a question should be resolved differently around

19

the country in different courtrooms depending on whether a

20

particular jury believes this agency official who says

21

yes, we always consider this kind of -- piece of

22

information in making a decision, versus another jury who

23

credits some former agency official who says, oh, no, that

was never important to us.

because it might well be true that fact A is terribly

important to a certain group of administrators, even

QUESTION:

8

MR. DREEBEN:

-- in contrast to some statutes

that does not matter at all, because the ultimate legal

10

issue is whether it could affect the activities of a

department or agency.
It's resolved at a very high level of

12

13

generality.

in a case like Kungys v. United States, where it was

whether this particular individual who received

citizenship procured his citizenship by a material

MR. HANSEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
It is our position in this case that the

Government is, indeed, asking this Court to take a very

6

great step beyond the Sixth Amendment cases and the due

7

process cases that this Court has consistently applied,

8

and in that regard, in making that observation it's

9

interesting to me to note that the Government's position

10

has evolved considerably from its opening brief to its

11

reply brief.
The Government for the first time has adopted

1

Sixth Amendment cases certainly do recognize that wherever

2

the court is dealing with a fact-bound element -- and

3

really in Kungys, even, this Court characterized in a

4

footnote the determination of materiality as fact-bound,

5

which is why the Ninth Circuit adopted that language.

That's a precise holding right on the issue here.

Sinclair dealt with an entirely different issue, and that

some of the more modern cases that we have relied upon to

-- the question presented by the

materiality of those statements to be resolved by the

court rather than the jury? -- I would think you'd look at

1001 for that.

15

MR. HANSEN:

You would, and as a matter of

16

statutory interpretation, every court that's examined it

17

has determined that materiality is an essential element.

18

Now, some of the courts who have ruled against

19

us, like in the Hausmann opinion, have stated, there is

merit to the argument that this should be decided by the

your answer.

MR. HANSEN:

3

That's where I'm finding the analogy, and the words, fact

and law, don't help very much, because I'm prepared to say

5

that both involve facts or law or whatever you want.

6

MR. HANSEN:

The judge in the

I agree that that analogy of law

7

and fact does not help.

It doesn't enlighten.

I think

8

the better comparison, though, is the issue of materiality

9

and the way it is determined in securities fraud cases,

10

bank fraud cases, wire fraud cases, and mail fraud cases,

11

where this court has historically, and every court has

12

historically held that that must be submitted to the jury

13

as a matter of Sixth Amendment and Fifth Amendment

14

j urisprudence.

15

I think once you realize that 1001, and look at

16

it for what it is, which is a generic false statement

17

statute that has nothing to do with courtrooms, the better

18

analogy is to the securities fraud cases, which often

19

involve complex practices.

20

As this Court said in Santa Fe Industries we've

21

got -- that's discussed in our brief, that it's difficult

22

for juries, but nevertheless the jury has to decide

23

whenever it's an element of the offense, and I would

24

submit that the most pertinent and important distinction

25

here to be drawn is whether it's an element of the

Now, in Sinclair, it was akin to relevance.

The

Court was determining in Sinclair that the issue was

whether or not that was a pertinent question to the

kind of cross-examination that has occurred in past cases

4

where the Court has determined it would be the same kind

5

of cross-examination that would occur if the jury

determined it, namely -- in this case was the payment of

the accounts in a multi-$ 0,000 loan transaction.

Why was

You could ask the same questions

And I think it's curious to note that this case

could have been prosecuted as a bank fraud case, and if

3

that had occurred, the witnesses would have been the same,

4

the questions would have been the same, the issue would

have been the same, but it would have been submitted to

QUESTION:

Is it open to us to decide this case

2

in your favor without reaching the constitutional

3

determination that would bind the States?

4

MR. HANSEN:

I would urge this Court to reach

5

the constitutional issue and, with all due respect to the

6

Government, I believe that the Government has avoided the

7

constitutional issue because I think there is no good

8

answer to the question, if it's an element of the offense,

9

why shouldn't the jury be deciding it, particularly if it

10

is a fact-bound element?

Why shouldn't it be decided like

and bank fraud, mail fraud, securities, fraud, which are

very commonly employed statutes, criminal and civil, and

in all of those cases there is a glaring anomaly, I would

MR. HANSEN:

I think what the Court needs to do,

as other courts that we have discussed in our brief, many

4

of them State supreme courts, the number isn't many,

5

perhaps, but several -- State v. Anderson and others, and

6

Judge Posner in the Staniforth case, which we discuss --

7

the Court needs to clarify that there is a difference

between relevance, as that term is used in Sinclair, and

materiality as that term is used in a false statement to a

21

Government official or in a securities fraud case.
QUESTION:

standard litany, when you're objecting to a question, is,

different than the materiality concept that you are

2

discussing?
MR. HANSEN:

3

As different as night from day, and

4

I think that's the reason there has been some confusion.

5

Materiality as a concept of relevancy is antiquated, and I

6

think some of the perjury cases are antiquated that the

7

Government relies upon.
Materiality, when it's an essential element of

8

9

the offense, is subject to a very clear definition.

This

10

Court set forth that definition in Kungys.

11

Blackmar and O'Malley has a conceptually indistinguishable

12

definition which should be used with juries for deciding

13

materiality.

14

QUESTION:

Devitt,

Why wouldn't we have to - - why --

15

just overrule all the relevance, because relevance in a

16

prior trial might well involve a host of factual matters.

17

What would in those circumstances have proved to have been

relevant might depend on what might have been admitted

later on.

cases, and in any proceeding where a witness feels that

they should not answer a question because it's not

Relevance is a

It has a different place and a

10

different application than an essential fact-bound element

11

of a criminal offense, which is what materiality is.
And again, I think we confuse materiality and

12

13

relevance because of the reason stated by Justice

14

Ginsburg, that it used to be part of a litany of

objections that attorneys made in courtrooms.

QUESTION:

Yes.
You're saying it's irrelevant, it's

MR. HANSEN:

Only, I submit, because there was

10

no right to a jury trial in Kungys, and the Court in

11

Kungys made clear that it's very much a factual inquiry.

12

In Kungys, a denaturalization proceeding, the defendant

13

had been deported, according to the court of appeals

14

decision, or should be denaturalized, because he had

15

misstated his age, and they were concerned -- the Court

16

was concerned, the Government was concerned that he had

17

previously worked at a Nazi death camp.

18

He had his own explanation for why he had

19

changed his date of birth, and that was to avoid Nazi

20

persecution when he was a resident of Germany, and because

21

he claimed that he had worked with the Lithuanian

22

resistance.

23

In that case, the Court states several times in

the course of the opinion, and I quote the phrase from a

body that this court reiterated and quoted in Kungys,

"materiality rests upon a factual, evidentiary showing,"

2

and at another point in discussing the opinion, or the

3

test in Kungys, the Court stated that "there are an

4

infinite variety of factual patterns that would affect

5

materiality."

6

It is clearly the kind of factual dispute that a

7

jury should resolve, and it bears no resemblance, I

8

submit, to the question of relevance and materiality as

9

that term has been used in the past.

10

In conclusion, I would urge this Court to affirm

11

the Ninth Circuit decision.

We feel that the distinction

12

that the Government is drawing, based upon whether the

13

person lied to, in effect, is a Government official, or a

14

bank, or a securities firm, is not a valid distinction,

15

and it certainly is not a valid reason for overriding the

very important Sixth Amendment requirement that a jury

pass upon all factual elements in a criminal offense.

of materiality, but that has never meant to courts around

the country that the ultimate question was a factual one

3

that had to be decided by a jury rather than a

determination that the court made.
QUESTION:

5

What about your opponent's argument

6

that if that is sound, then we should go the other way, I

7

suppose he says in the bank, in the mail, in the

8

securities fraud cases?
MR. DREEBEN:

9

Well, I think, Justice Souter,

10

that's the same distinction that we were discussing

11

earlier between the effect of the representation on a

12

reasonable private person and the effect of a

13

representation on a Government agent.

14

In Kungys and Sinclair, this Court did ascertain

15

what the particular governmental entity was doing.

It

16

ascertained that the INS was seeking to determine whether

17

somebody was qualified for citizenship.

18

Court had to determine what the congressional inquiry was

19

in order to figure out whether a question was pertinent to

it.

But once it had ascertained those predicate

22

facts, which I think are analogous, as Justice Breyer

pointed out, to the determination of what the agency's

program is, the ultimate application of the legal standard

25

is one that the court can do as a matter of law.
