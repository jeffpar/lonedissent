ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Under the Medicare Act and section 413.9 of its

11

implementing regulations, the United States reimburses the

12

reasonable cost of services provided to Medicare

13

beneficiaries.

14

reimbursement determinations under the act subject to

15

judicial review under the APA.

16

The Secretary of HHS makes the

This case concerns whether, in making these

17

determinations, the Secretary is required by her

18

regulations to apply generally accepted accounting

19

principles even when she rationally determines in a

20

particular case that application of those principles will

21 '

not arrive at the reasonable cost for the services

22

provided during the reimbursement period.

23

In our view, the language of the regulations

24

contains no such requirement.

25

regulations, on which the court of appeals relied,

Section 413.20 of the

1

specifies that providers are to maintain their cost

2

records by use of standardized definitions and accounting

3

procedures and practices, and states, and I quote, "that

4

essentially reimbursement under the act involves making

5

use of that cost data to arrive at equitable and proper

6

payment" while nothing in these general admonitions about

7

maintaining and using cost data to arrive at equitable and

8

proper payment represents a clear, unambiguous and firm

9

undertaking by the Secretary that she will always apply

10
11

GAAP in reimbursement determinations.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Jones, you say that this

12

regulation, 413.20, just governs how Medicare providers

13

are to report their costs to the HHS - -

14

MR. JONES:

15

QUESTION:

To maintain their costs.
-- or to the intermediary, and if

16

that's so, then what regulations say how HHS will

17

determine the method to be used in providing

18

reimbursement?

19

MR. JONES:

Section 413.9 of the regulation is

20

the substantive standard that provides that all payments

21

will be made with respect to reasonable costs.

22

substantive standard.

23

QUESTION:

That's the

Section 413.20 -Well, if you mandate the provider to

24

follow generally accepted accounting principles, and I

25

guess you concede that under generally accepted accounting

1

principles these amounts would be reportable and

2

recoverable up front --

3

MR. JONES:

4

QUESTION:

No, we --- then I don't know why the

5

Secretary shouldn't follow the same program in determining

6

what's reimbursable.

7

MR. JONES:

I think the easiest way for me to

8

explain that is to point out that, even if a provider

9

follows a particular format in submitting the costs, that

10

does not mean that the costs thus submitted are reasonable

11

costs to be reimbursed under Medicare.
For example, under accrual accounting, which is

12

13

what the regulation talks about, or even under GAAP, a

14

hospital with gold plumbing could arrive at a valid

15

accounting statement for its actual depreciation costs.

16

QUESTION:

Well, but now wait a minute, I

17

thought the Secretary had said, yes, the costs we're

18

talking about here in this case are reimbursable, we're

19

just going to do it annually, we're not going to do it up

20

front.

21

reimbursable costs?

22

Don't we assume that these are reasonable

MR. JONES:

Well, as the administrator pointed

23

out in this case, the timing, the coordination of the

24

timing of the cost with the periods benefited by that cost

25

is as important in the determination of reasonable cost as

1

the amount of the cost.
QUESTION:

2

Well, but this isn't gold-plated

3

plumbing.

This is something that the Secretary says, yes,

4

we'll let you have, but we're going to do it annually.

5

Isn't that right?
MR. JONES:

6

Well,

there's -- there are several

7

points involved in your question, and let me see if I can

8

address them.

9

The first point is whether these regs require

10

that we imply -- employ GAAP, and our point is,

11

of the regulations doesn't require it, and it would be

12

illogical for any such requirement to exist, because GAAP

13

has only a remote relationship to whether costs are

14

reasonable.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones,

the text

if you could give an

16

answer to Justice O'Connor's question, did the reporter

17

report accurately,

clear up until your brief in this case that you conceded

19

that the hospital's report form was okay.

report.

21

continuing to make that concession in your brief here.

22

Did the hospital report properly?

23

that would be helpful.

I think it was

It was a proper

regulations, what the hospital is required to do is to

the format requirement of the reimbursement requirement,

whether the costs thus reported are reasonable with

6

The question is, having met

Just -- did the hospital report

properly?

8

doesn't have to match the report, but the hospital asked

9

the question, we have to fill out this form and claim our

You seem to be saying, the reimbursement

10

costs.

Was that cost report proper in compliance with the

11

statute and regulations?
MR. JONES:

12

It was proper as to amount and not

13

as to the timing of the attribution of the costs to the

14

periods benefited by the expense.

15

QUESTION:

So it was an improper cost report.

16

You're not making the argument that, yes, the report was

17

proper, but the reimbursement doesn't have to correspond

18

to the report?

19

MR. JONES:

Well, that is -- maybe I'm

20

misunderstanding your question about what is a cost

21

report.

22

QUESTION:

What the hospital filed, should the

23

hospital, instead of taking this all at once have split it

24

up, have amortized it, as you did in your reimbursement?

25

MR. JONES:

Yes.

If they had followed PRM 233,

1

that is the way they would have submitted their cost

2

report.

3

require its intermediaries to recast these expenses when

4

they're submitted in a manner that doesn't correspond to

5

the Secretary's reimbursement rules.

It makes little sense for the Secretary to

QUESTION:

6

But if they follow generally accepted

7

accounting principles, they could have filed it exactly as

8

they did.

9

MR. JONES:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. JONES:

12

They did follow, and did file -They did do that, didn't they?
-- based upon generally accepted

accounting principles for this type of transaction.

13

QUESTION:

And in theory, the regulation 413.20

14

says if you do that you're -- that's proper for your

15

report.

16

QUESTION:

I don't know what 413.20 means, if it

17

doesn't mean that.

18

that the report filed was proper, or else 413.20 has no

19

meaning.

20

MR. JONES:

It seems to me you have to concede

I will concede it for purposes of

21

this argument, that we don't have a problem with providers

22

estimating their costs in an accurate manner, which they

23

did, and submitting them to us for us to make a

24

determination of what reasonable cost is.

1

them to do that in 413.20.
MR. JONES:

2

Well, I don't want to quibble, but

3

on the other hand, this is our regulation, and we're

4

entitled to interpret it, and all that that regulation -QUESTION:

5

No, but there's -- may I just raise

6

this basic question about your interpretation?

7

understand you, you're saying 413.9 is the operative

8

regulation on reimbursement, 413.20 and 413.24 are simply

9

accounting and reporting regulations, and accounting does

10

As I

not necessarily determine reimbursability.

11

MR. JONES:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.
Isn't it very odd, should we not

13

consider it very odd in trying to make sense of 413.20 and

14

413.24 that the only regulation on reimbursement is at

15

this very high level of generality, 413.9, whereas all of

16

the detailed regulations, or regulations of comparatively

17

greater detail, do not even address the ultimate issue of

18

reimbursability.

us to read, and, with respect,

20

413.24 .

21

That seems to me an unreasonable way for

MR. JONES:

for you to read, 413.20 and

It is easy to gloss over the

22

specific words of these regs, and I certainly don't want

23

to do that, but I think that it's also important to

24

realize that the statute and the reg 413.9 are the

25

substantive standard.

Congress adopted reasonable cost as

the substantive standard.

2

if we wanted to, and we don't want to.
QUESTION:

3

We couldn't alter that standard

Well, true, but in trying to make

4

sense of 20 and 24, there's something very strange about

5

your going to the trouble of greater detail in those, when

6

you never go to the trouble, or the Secretary never goes

7

to the trouble, on your reading, of addressing in detail

8

the question of reimbursability.

9

MR. JONES:

Well, the only detail referred to in

10

413.20 is advice that you should use standard definitions

11

in accounting practices.

one way, and if it doesn't, it's going to go the other

MR. JONES:

The detail that should answer this

case is whether these are reasonable costs.

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

Let me explain --

11

principles.

accounting methodologies, and it's with that thought in

mind that I think the Court should consider the consistent

interpretation of the Secretary since these regs were

adopted over 20 years ago.

The

1

cost data so we can audit it, and we want you to maintain

2

it by reference to standard definitions and accounting

3

practices, and then the last sentence explains the context

4

that I'm trying to inarticulately establish, and that's,

5

last sentence says, essentially reimbursement under the

6

act involves making use of this data to arrive at

7

equitable and proper payment.
Now, I understand essentially means mainly

8

9

involve, making use of means we're going to do something

10

to the data that you've given us to arrive at something

11

else, and that something else is equitable and proper

12

payment, and to know what that means we go to the statute

13

and 413.9, which says reasonable cost.

14

QUESTION:

I understand, Mr. Jones.

However,

15

the statute requires that the manner of determining

16

reimbursement be prescribed by regulations.

17

contention that the only regulation the Secretary has

18

issued to comply with that statutory mandate is 413.9?

19

That's it?

Is it your

20

I mean, Congress goes to the trouble to say, you

21

know, the reasonable costs shall be actually incurred, and

22

shall be determined in accordance with regulations

23

establishing the method or methods to be used.

24

MR. JONES:

25

QUESTION:

That's what it says.
Congress does not always require

regulations to be issued.

2

you tell us that the only thing the Secretary did to

3

comply with that was 14. , which is what, you

4

know -- almost nothing.
MR. JONES:

5

Here, it specifically does, and

Justice Scalia, the statute doesn't

say the Secretary shall issue regs, it says, reasonable

7

costs shall be determined in accordance with the regs.

8

These reasonable cost cases - QUESTION:

In accordance with

regulations - MR. JONES:

11
12

Not the regs.

-- regulations adopted by the

Secretary.
QUESTION:

You don't think that's a requirement

to issue regulations?
MR. JONES:

I think that for the last 20-some

16

years the Secretary, as in this case, has been making

17

determinations as to reimbursable costs under section

18

413. , which is the requirement that payment shall be made

1

of reasonable costs.

20

QUESTION:

Are there other indications, other

21

illustrations, apart from this one, where the report from

22

the hospital is correct, it's a proper report, it reports

23

Yes.

1

cost, so the debate is, as here, not whether you can take

2

this cost, but when?

3

MR. JONES:

Yes.

Yes, there's a very good

4

example that I'd like to describe in some detail for you.

5

It came out of the Research Medical Center case in the

6

Eighth Circuit, and what the court held -- what that was

7

about was where, in preconstruction of a facility,

8

interest was accruing on a debt.

9

interest.

10
11

It was reasonable

It was reasonably related to the construction

of this facility.
What the Secretary determined in a PRM was that

12

this type of preconstruction interest should not be paid

13

by Medicare, it should be capitalized until the building

14

is finished, and then it should be reimbursed over an

15

amortized period while the building's being used.

16

Now, the reason that she did it that way was

17

because it is extremely important in Medicare to align the

18

costs incurred over the periods benefited by this cost,

19

precisely because the hospital's level of reimbursement,

20

the percentage of its costs that are repaid, fluctuates

21

depending upon the level of service.

22

And in the Research Medical Center case, the

23

court gave the example of a cost incurred by a hospital in

24

year 1 that provides benefits for 10 years, and the court

25

said that if the Medicare payment, if Medicare paid that

1

whole cost in year 1, and then the hospital stopped

2

covering Medicare patients in years 2 and thereafter, the

3

result would be Medicare fully paid for costs that

4

benefited non-Medicare patients in other years.

5

result would precisely contradict the statutory cross -

6

subsidization rule, which is that Medicare funds shall not

7

be used to provide benefits for non-Medicare patients.

8

9

QUESTION:

That

That depends on whether you regard

these charges as charges that are attributable to what was

10

done in the past, or, rather, as charges that are

11

attributable to the new financing, which is really a very

12

theological question.

13

MR. JONES:

14

QUESTION:

It -And I, you know, I don't know, you

15

could answer it either way, and generally accepted

16

accounting principles have answered it the other way.

17

Now, if you had wanted to answer it your way and

18

had put that answer down in regulations instead of in what

19

you call the Secretary's Provider Reimbursement Manual, we

20

would have a lot more information in front of us from that

21

regulation which might have been challenged in court at

22

the time it was issued, but you didn't do that.

23

put it in your manual.

MR. JONES:

1

this case is a rational application.

referring to, Justice Scalia, is the question of whether

referred to, 42 C.F.R. 413.153 sets out limits on the

question that the Secretary has relied on for over 20

years is that her authority is by statute and regulation

to make determinations of reasonable costs, and that that

is the manner in which these determinations are made.

MR. JONES:

If you were

Of course, I haven't talked to those

10

people, and so I would be hypothesizing, but I can tell

11

you from representing Government agencies there's always a

12

tension, if not a risk, involved in making a concrete,

13

substantive rule that's binding that reduces the

14

flexibility.

15

You come up with the rule that you say, if A, B,

hospitals then say, well, A and B happened, but we did D

of the manual to this case is, it shows that the hospital

of her regulations is entitled to controlling weight, and

since both the court of appeals and the district court

MR. JONES:

1

My first point is -- and time's

2

running short -- that simply all you have to decide is

3

whether there's a rational basis for the Secretary to have

4

had a different view, and both the courts below agreed

that there was.

6

More importantly, in my view, these interest

7

costs of these bonds that are going to be extinguished

8

continue to accrue as an economic fact until they are in

9

fact extinguished, which in this case doesn't happen for

10

7 years, and so what the Secretary -- I'm sorry, what the

11

hospital has attempted to do is prepay the economic costs

12

of the old bonds, even though they remain in existence,

13

and what the Secretary has concluded is that amortizing

14

those prepayments over the remaining periods more

15

accurately coordinates the real benefits of this

transaction with the costs incurred.

I thought you were reading section 20 --

such a way that the appropriate phrases there simply pick

up whatever the generally accepted accounting principles

are at the time and incorporate them, so that if those

When she wants to

She did not do that here.

Do you have any notion about how many

items in this manual are inconsistent with GAAP?
MR. TAEBEL:

I do know, Your Honor, that based

13

on other court decisions, the Secretary has sought to

14

promulgate by regulation several of her manual provisions.

15

That's discussed in the amicus brief.

16

in the Federal Register.

17

but bear in mind, please, that most costs are reported and

18

paid consistent with generally accepted accounting

19

principles.

20

It's a 1991 notice

She has the ability to do that,

That's exactly why the program utilizes GAAP.

QUESTION:

Yes, but what if you have a period

21

where there is no answer in GAAP, as I gather is your view

22

from 1966 to 1972, and the Secretary establishes a policy

that GAAP later disagrees with.

Your Honor.

She has to follow GAAP --

QUESTION:

That's what the regulation says,

Even though, if there was already a

4

regulation on the book which had been interpreted in an

5

interpretive bulletin that had been on the books for

6

several years and no one had questioned, she would

7

nevertheless have to abandon that interpretive bulletin

8

and follow GAAP?

9

MR. TAEBEL:

Her regulations control over the

10

manual provision, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

She has adopted GAAP --

But at the time, under my hypothesis,

12

at the time the manual was promulgated it correctly

13

explained what the regulation was.

14

MR. TAEBEL:

Actually, it did not, Your Honor.

15

Her method is not even consistent with one of the GAAP

16

methods.

17

QUESTION:

Well, I was assuming that as a

18

hypothesis, that nevertheless she would have to change it

19

when GAAP plugged what was previously a loophole.

20
21

22

MR. TAEBEL:

Once she's adopted GAAP, if GAAP

changes she would have to change her regulation.
QUESTION:

What are you relying on for the

23

proposition -- you're simply saying that the language of

24

413.20 adopts GAAP?

25

MR. TAEBEL:

Yes, it does, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

11

What if there's a conflict between,

say, a standard accounting and a standard statistic, or

13

standard reporting practice?

14

MR. TAEBEL:

Well, I think in this case, Your

Honor, we rely on GAAP to report our costs, and we claim

16

that when a cost is incurred, according to GAAP, it then

17

must be payable under the Medicare program.

regulatory language.

QUESTION:

That sounds like the Secretary has a good

MR. TAEBEL:

The problem with that, though,

10

Mr. Chief Justice, is that she has to promulgate her

11

methods of reimbursement by regulation.

MR. TAEBEL:

2

But prior to 1986, Your Honor, when

3

the regulations were redesignated, 413.20 had been part of

4

former part 405, and the subchapter heading it was under

5

at that time was "Reasonable Cost Reimbursement General

6

Rules."

7

That changed when the designation of the

8

regulations changed, beginning in 1986.

9

refunding here occurred in 1985.
QUESTION:

10

The advanced

If I can --

In effect, you're saying that unless

11

you read 419.20 as a reimbursement reg, the Secretary has

12

not issued adequate regs as required by the statute.

13

That's your major premise.

14

MR. TAEBEL:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

QUESTION:

And what follows as a result of that,

17

That is correct, Your Honor.

when she doesn't issue adequate regs?

13

MR. TAEBEL:

Exactly what the Sixth Circuit

19

held, Your Honor, and that is her manual provision, which

is a substantive rule, when it conflicts with the

would be that we shouldn't read it to be an invalid reg,

2

that if, indeed, the Secretary would not have complied

3

with the law adequately unless 413.20 is read to be a

4

substantive requirement and not just a reporting

5

requirement, we should not assume that the Secretary was

not complying with the law, and therefore we should read

it as a substantive requirement.

argument.

9

MR. TAEBEL:

I guess’that's your

It is, Your Honor, and we're

10

maintaining that interpretation here should not be

11

deferred to, because it's inconsistent with the plain

12

language of the regulation.

13

QUESTION:

The plain language says -- it says

14

that they are followed. It says they are followed, but the

15

language has to do with reporting, so you'd have to imply

16

that the substantive reimbursement also follows it, which

17

is not what it says, but maybe it's a fair implication.

18

But if it's a fair implication, I take it it would be

doesn't call for it on reimbursement unless you imply

that would be fair,

to put in regs?

and

1

entitled to the full Medicare portion of its advanced

refunding loss in the year of the refinancing.
That is because, under the prior manual

provision 215, Guernsey Memorial's loss qualified as a

5

small loss, which was meaning it was less than 50 percent

6

of what its interest expense otherwise would have been.

7

Therefore, under that manual provision, we would have

8

received the full Medicare portion quite unlike what her

9

treatment is now, when she's issued 233.
So we have inconsistencies between 233 and the

underlying regulations, we have inconsistencies between

MR. TAEBEL:

There were 18 voting members, Your

Honor, and 3 dissented, and the dissents are not

consistent with the Secretary's position here, either.

QUESTION:

They do suggest the contrary view is

not irrational, at least.
MR. TAEBEL:

They suggest, Your Honor, that

8

there had been different methods at that time, and that

9

because the loss relates to the prior period, or the

10

period when the refunded bonds were in existence, that's

11

why the APB decided it had to be only one method, and that

12

is, you recognize it currently in income.

13

In conclusion, then, Your Honor, we respectfully

14

request that this Court affirm the decision of the Sixth

15

Circuit below.

16

Thank you.

Mr. Jones, you have 2 minutes remaining.

Thank you, Mr. Taebel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MR. JONES:

Thank you.

22

There are two questions of interpretation.

The

23

first is whether the Secretary is required by her

24

regulations to apply GAAP in reimbursement determinations.

25

Her consistent and contemporaneous interpretation of the

That interpretation has been set out in the

manual, which makes quite clear that GAAP applies only if

4

there is no other applicable manual provision.

made clear in her litigation over the last 15 years on

6

this subject, and her rational and contemporaneous,

7

consistent interpretation should be given controlling

3

weight in understanding her own regulation.

It's been

Now, the other question of interpretation is
10

whether the amortization of these types of advance

11

refunding costs are rationally to be related to the

12

periods over which they benefit the hospital by reducing

13

its costs.

14

eminently rational.

15

For the reasons that we've explained, it seems
The courts below agreed with that.

And not to quibble, but there were three

16

dissents to the GAAP opinion, but one of the part -- one

17

of the members of that opinion who assented to the opinion

18

also believed that amortization would have been proper.

This is an issue on which accrual accounting
