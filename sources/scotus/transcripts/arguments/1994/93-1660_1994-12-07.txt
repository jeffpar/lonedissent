ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD R. GRANT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRANT:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In this case, the Arizona supreme court held

10
11

that where a police officer arrested respondent based on a

12

police computer report of an outstanding misdemeanor

13

arrest warrant, where that warrant had actually been

14

quashed prior to the arrest, that the exclusionary rule

15

required suppression of the evidence seized pursuant to

16

that arrest, regardless of whether the error that resulted

17

in the warrant's continued presence in the computer system

18

was the responsibility of judicial personnel or police

19

personnel.

20

It's the State's position that this holding of

21

the Arizona supreme court is inconsistent with this

22

Court's decisions in Leon, Massachusetts v. Sheppard, and

23

Krull, and the State of Arizona asks this Court to reverse

24

the Arizona supreme court's judgment.

25

Before I get into what I have stated is the main

argument -QUESTION:

2

Now, Mr. Grant, do you take the

3

position that the law enforcement agency, the police or

4

the law enforcement agency have no duty or responsibility

5

to keep computer records up to date?
MR. GRANT:

6

7

Honor.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

No, I don't take that position, Your

In this instance, do we know whether

the police had any obligation to update their computer
records?
MR. GRANT:

11

We had an evidentiary hearing on the

12

motion to suppress.

13

essentially was that it made no difference whether the

14

error was judicial or police.

15

QUESTION:

16

The defense position at that hearing

The defense developed no --

I guess the courts below never

actually made a determination, did they --

17

MR. GRANT:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. GRANT:

The trial judge --- as to whose error it was?
-- did not.

I believe a fair

20

reading of the -- of the ruling is that he was willing to

21

assume that the error was judicial rather than police, but

22

he made no specific factual finding.

23

QUESTION:

Would it be a different case if this

24

listing had continued for several months and had not been

25

corrected?

Would there be some point in time when you

1

would think that the blame could shift to the police, and

2

therefore exclusion could be a remedy?

3

MR. GRANT:

I believe it would be a different

4

case, yes.

5

getting away from what I think is the clear issue here,

6

that the error was the result of judicial personnel, not

7

police personnel.
QUESTION:

8

9

I believe in that sort of situation you'd be

Although we actually don't know that

here?
MR. GRANT:

10

Well, I think the evidence is clear

11

that that's -- that's why the warrant was still in the

12

computer system here.

13

QUESTION:

14

that predated Leon.

15

1971, that said where an arrest warrant is invalid, so is

16

any arrest that results, and the evidence must be

17

excluded.

18

case and that holding?

19

Mm-hmm.

There was a case that we had

It was that Whiteley v. Warden in

Do you take the view that Leon altered that

MR. GRANT:

I think -- I think the -- I'm

20

drawing a blank on the name of the case for the moment,

21

but I do not -- I think the result would have been the

22

same under Leon, because in Whiting, I -- or Whiteley,

23

what the officer presented to the judge in order to obtain

24

the warrant was simply a bare bones affidavit, and in Leon

25

this Court noted that that sort of situation would not be

1

the sort that would be justifiable for the good faith

2

exclusion to the -- exception to the exclusionary rule.
I also think there's a distinction between

3
4

Whiteley and this -- in this case, and I think it's

5

followed through in Leon, in that what the Court should

6

look at, in Whiteley you looked at -- the warrant began

7

with an officer instigating it.

8

obtained the warrant based on a good faith -- excuse me,

9

based on a bare bones affidavit, which Leon has said is

He went to the judge and

10

something that the Court will not recognize and not allow

11

the officers to rule on.
Here, the warrant was initiated by a justice

12

13

court.

14

Mr. Evans failed to appear before the justice court.

15

justice court put the warrant into the police system for

16

the purpose of getting police assistance and arresting Mr.

17

Evans and bringing him before the court, and it was the

18

justice court's failure, I think that's clear from the

19

record, to make the call to the sheriff's office and have

20

that warrant removed once it was quashed, that is to blame

21

for Mr. Evans' arrest.

22

The justice court issued this arrest warrant when
The

In that situation, I think the good faith

23

exception does not require -- the good faith exception

24

applies, and the exclusionary rule should not be applied

25

to suppress the evidence.

QUESTION:

1

What do you make of the argument

2

which is suggested at -- toward the end of the

3

respondent's brief, based upon, in effect the peculiar

4

risks that computers bring -- I think the argument

5

essentially runs that because of the great currency which

6

computerized information has, the risk of crime is greater

7

than it used to be when we were just dealing with pieces

8

of paper in local police departments?
The police have chosen to use computers.

9

Why

10

shouldn't we recognize the risk involved in using them by

11

saying that if you choose to use them, you are going to be

12

strictly responsible for the accuracy of the information

13

in them?

14

MR. GRANT:

I would disagree that this Court

15

ought to fashion a rule that the police ought to be

16

strictly responsible.

17

this Court could consider, what sort of procedures do the

18

police have in place to audit them.
QUESTION:

19

I think the risk issue is something

How do we -- how do we translate the

20

consideration of that risk into a practical rule?

21

you think would be an appropriate rule that would reflect

22

that risk?

23

MR. GRANT:

What do

I think in a case unlike this, where

24

I think the error is clearly based on judicial error, not

25

police error, I think that what the Court ought to look at

is the objective reasonableness of the arresting

2

officers -- of the arresting officers and whether --

3

QUESTION:

What about the position of the

4

Arizona supreme court, that seemed to say in this modern

5

age to try to assign fault to a particular piece of the

6

Government doesn't quite work, because it's manipulable

7

where you lodge the computer.

8

agency as distinguished from a police authority, so it

9

should be not strict liability.

10

Someone is careless.

You could do it in a civil

That seemed to me the

11

position that the Arizona supreme court was taking.

It

12

doesn't quite fit when -- in the days when the police

13

officer could call the court and would have gotten

14

accurate information, the shift from those days to the day

15

when you touch a couple of buttons and you get an answer

16

on the screen.

17

Wasn't the Arizona supreme court telling us the

18

fix on the police station as distinguished for the system

19

is wrong for the computer age?

20

MR. GRANT:

I don't -- I think that goes beyond

21

what the Arizona supreme court said, and I think what the

22

Arizona supreme court said is inconsistent with what this

23

Court has said in its recent decisions over the last

24

several years interpreting the exclusionary rule, which

25

is, it doesn't apply whenever there's a Fourth Amendment

violation, it only applies when the purpose of it is most

2

effectively served.

3

QUESTION:

Well --

4

QUESTION:

Isn't the purpose here, though,

5

deterrence, deterrence not of errors that crop up or that

6

take a few days to correct, but of carelessness, and the

7

deterrent purpose is to keep official records updated?

8

Isn't it a powerful deterrent to say, if you don't update

9

within a reasonable time, you can't use the evidence?
MR. GRANT:

10
11

deterrent.

12

this case, however.

13

QUESTION:

That may well be a powerful

I don't think it's a reasonable deterrent in

Well, certainly Sheppard and Leon

14

were -- it's not as if they were decided 50 years ago.

15

They were decided, what, 10 years ago?

16

the computer age, isn't it?

17

MR. GRANT:

18

yes, computers were available.

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Certainly that's

They didn't involve computers, but

They were available, but not as

widely used.
But let me ask you this:

your test is the

22

objective reasonableness of the arresting officer's

23

conduct, as I understand it and, therefore, if the officer

24

reasonably believed there was an outstanding warrant, the

25

arrest is okay?

MR. GRANT:

1

Well, I think that goes a little

2

beyond my position.

3

the error is the result --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. GRANT:

6

7

I think my basic position is, where

Well if --- of judicial personnel, not police

personnel.
QUESTION:

If you describe it broadly, as I did,

8

you would have to agree it would really not matter whether

9

the error was committed by a police officer in the

home

10

office or by a judicial officer in the home office

--

11

MR. GRANT:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

If the --- because in either case the officer

acted reasonably.
MR. GRANT:

I think if you get beyond the

15

situation we have in this case, I think what the Court

16

ought to focus on is the arresting officer and any other

17

officers involved in the investigative team, for lack of a

18

better word.

19

QUESTION:

But if you don't acknowledge that

20

there's any reason -- if the deterrence focuses on the

21

arresting officer, there's no difference between the

22

cases, and on the other hand, if the deterrence focuses on

23

trying to be sure people keep their records up to date,

24

again there's no difference between the two cases.

25

should we draw a difference between a judicial mistake of

Why

2

this kind an executive mistake of this kind?
MR. GRANT:

I think -- I think the deterrence --

3

if you look at what happened in this case, an officer was

4

presented with a situation where he witnesses one

5

violation of a traffic law.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GRANT:

Right.
He then had a person who admitted a

8

second violation of a Class 1 misdemeanor.

He then went

9

to a police computer and obtained confirmation of that

10

violation of the Class 1 misdemeanor, and also obtained

11

information showing that there was an outstanding

12

misdemeanor arrest for his warrant.

13

QUESTION:

So his information would be exactly

14

the same whether the misinformation about the warrant,

15

regardless of who was responsible for that misin --

16

MR. GRANT:

I agree, and I think his conduct --

17

QUESTION:

Well then, my question is, why do you

18

draw a distinction?

19

MR. GRANT:

Well, I think the distinction I draw

20

here between judicial and police is that it's -- there's

21

no need to go beyond that in the facts of this case.

22

If the Court wanted to go beyond that, I think

23

the distinction ought to lie with -- where the Court ought

24

to draw the line is with the investigating officers and

25

any other officers involved in the investigative team.

QUESTION:

1

Well, Mr. Grant, I thought in U.S. v.

2

Hensley, decided in 1985, that we specifically said the

3

rule is what the police department as a whole knows or

4

doesn't know that counts in determining the Fourth

5

Amendment violation.

6

MR. GRANT:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GRANT:
QUESTION:

10

True.
And you're asking us to alter that, I

gather.
MR. GRANT:

12

13

We expressly said it doesn't rest on

what the arresting officer knew or didn't know.

9

11

I don't --

No, I'm not.

I think what I'm

saying is consistent with Hensley.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I don't think what you say --

15

at least what you have been saying is consistent with that

16

at all.

17

MR. GRANT:

I think in Hensley the Court was

18

faced with a situation where the officer who made the stop

19

did not have the personal knowledge, which is similar to

20

this case.

21

the instigating officer, the officer who had the

22

knowledge, and if he -- if the knowledge he had was

23

sufficient to justify the stop, then the stop by the

24

arresting officer was good.

25

What the Court then looked at in Hensley was

In this case, you have an arresting officer who

1

had no knowledge.

You don't have an instigating officer.

2

The instigating event came from a judicial -QUESTION:

3

Yes, but you have a system that the

4

police department has invoked to enable it to function

5

that involves using a computer system so that they can

6

punch out the information right there in their vehicles

7

and find out if there's an outstanding arrest warrant.

8

mean, that's something the police department itself has

9

made use of for their own purposes, so presumably they

10

have some responsibility for how it functions.

11

MR. GRANT:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GRANT:

14

responsibility, yes.

15

QUESTION:

I agree -- You would agree with that.
I agree they have some

Well, would you lose your case if you

16

said that the responsibility is not just that of the

17

investigating officer but also of the entire police

18

department, but not for mistakes on the judicial side?

In this case, no, I would not lose

QUESTION:

-- Arizona supreme court, though, to

my case.

22

have taken a different line.

I read that court to say,

23

it's the legal system that installed these computers, and

24

it doesn't matter whether the slip -- there must be a

25

slip, but the question of where the slip is in the court,

1

in the police office, should not be dispositive.
MR. GRANT:

2

I think that's what the Arizona

3

supreme court said, and I think that's inconsistent with

4

what this Court said in Leon and other cases, that there

5

are - QUESTION:

6

But maybe they were right and we were

7

wrong.

8

problems of computers and our prior cases were not, and I

9

think as Justice Ginsburg has suggested, the point was

I mean, this case is dealing specifically with the

10

that the deterrence factor is being, at least in Arizona,

11

tailored to what it sees to be the problem, and it's a

12

problem that cannot be limited just to police departments,

13

it's a problem of the governmental system.

14

a better view than the view that may have been implicit in

15

Leon?

16

MR. GRANT:

Why isn't that

Because I don't think applying that

17

broad brush with the exclusionary rule is going to change

18

reasonable actions by officers in the street.

19

officer essentially had no choice but to do --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. GRANT:

22

QUESTION:

This

Well, then you're right back --- other than what he did.
-- to the problem that you admit that

23

your rule cannot be that narrow.

You -- at least I assume

24

you do, because if you don't do that, then it seems to me

25

you're going to have to take the bitter with the sweet.

1

And if we were going to say the only person to

2

whom we look is the officer in the street, then I would

3

suppose on the legality of a warrantless arrest and the

4

lawfulness of a warrantless search, and so on, we would

5

not look beyond what happened to be in the mind of the

6

officer who made the search.

7

So if we're going to have a broad rule that we

8

impute all knowledge of the police to all members of the

9

department in your benefit, then I suppose you've got to

10
11

take the same -- the burden of that same rule, too.
MR. GRANT:

I don't think Whiteley and Hensley

12

go as broad as Your Honor is drawing them.

13

Whiteley and Hensley can be more narrowly drawn to focus

14

on the arresting officer and anyone involved in the

15

investigation.

16

QUESTION:

I think

Well, you in any event, leaving the

17

question of where the line is drawn, you accept the view

18

that the mind of someone other than the one officer doing

19

the search or making the arrest may be relevant to the

20

determination of what is reasonable.

21

MR. GRANT:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. GRANT:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.
You accept that.
Yes.
All right.

Then why do we draw the

line between the police on the one hand and the larger

1

Government on the other?
MR. GRANT:

2

3

Because, as this Court has said, the

exclusionary rule exists to deter police misconduct.

4

QUESTION:

Well, I realize that, but the Arizona

5

argument said there's somebody else whom you'd better

6

deter, because if you don't include the Government more

7

broadly within your deterrent objective, you have no way,

8

as a practical matter, of inducing care in the use of

9

these computers.
MR. GRANT:

10

I think, first of all, we're beyond

11

far what the facts of this case are, but I think if what

12

you want to deter is officers acting unreasonably, you're

13

not going to accomplish that by --

14

QUESTION:

But that's the -- that is the very

15

denial of the premise upon which I think Arizona was

16

arguing.

17

the officer, because if we don't do that, there's never

18

going to be an effective way of deterring inaccuracy in

19

computers.

20

Arizona was saying, we want to deter more than

MR. GRANT:

I don't think Arizona could go

21

beyond what this Court has said, which is I feel what they

22

have in this --

QUESTION:

Well, this Court perhaps can, and why

shouldn't it?

QUESTION:

MR. GRANT:

QUESTION:

7

MR. GRANT:

8

QUESTION:

9

Why?
I think the -Why?
-- exclusionary rule is a narrow -Why?
-- procedural remedy -Why should it be kept that way?

Why

should we not consider it relevant that the system

10

maintains computers and therefore a deterrent rule, which

11

is meant to make computer information accurate, should

12

consider the entire system and not just the police?

13

MR. GRANT:

14

QUESTION:

I think -Mr. Grant, it's not just a problem of

15

what you want to deter, it's also a problem of how

16

effective the deterrent will be, and I would think that

Would it not be true that if you let -- took

the effectiveness of it becomes

2

less the further away you move from the arresting officer

3

and the people involved in the investigative team, and in

4

those cases the balancing that is required, the cost that

is incurred by suppressing relevant and reliable evidence,

6

becomes greater, and the deterrence value becomes less.

7

QUESTION:

If we say that there's a difference

8

between judicial personnel and police personnel, if that's

9

the line we draw, is it plausible that we might also

remand this case because it's not clear what the Arizona

11

court would have done based on that hypothesis, or based

12

on that principle?

13

MR. GRANT:

I think that's plausible.

I think

14

the evidence in this case strongly supports the finding

15

that there was a judicial error here and not a police

error.

there was reason to stop the defendant, and examined what

he knew, the officer who started the whole procedure by

asking --by putting the flier, the stop flier into the

6

system.

7

Here you don't have that.

It was started by a

8

justice court, and the justice court was responsible for

9

its continued presence in the system after it had been

10

quashed.
QUESTION:

11

Is there anything else you'd like to

12

say about the problem of the computer?

13

there any facts or any indication about whether the

19

come in.

20

Then there's an exception to that rule, is if

21

the officers were in good faith, and I guess that

exception rests on the theory that putting that pressure

careful about that computer generating false arrest

warrants which aren't true.

QUESTION:

As far -That seems to be what people are

7

driving at, and I just wondered, you're familiar with the

8

operations of these things, and is there any light you can

shed on whether the pressure that would be put on computer

operators and all those associated with it to be careful

not to arrest people where there is no arrest warrant, why

12

that pressure wouldn't be meaningful, or significant, or

13

the same as normal in an exclusionary rule case, or maybe

14

the opposite?
MR. GRANT:

15

I think the need to keep information

in which the Government had the burden of proving that the

police were blameless.

This they did not do.

If you care to go back to that, you will find

5

that they called as a witness the chief clerk of the

of this procedure, so it's not at all clear that the

achieved by the exclusion of this evidence.
Where you are dealing with the people who are in

the business of making an arrest, who are at least on the

13

team, you are telling them, unless you do things right,

14

this arrest and whatever you get from it is going to be

15

inadmissible.

16

That causes them to be careful.

But when you're dealing with somebody who's made

17

a negligent mistake, who doesn't even expect an arrest to

18

occur, how does it possibly deter anybody to say, if you

19

punch a wrong thing into the computer, the mistaken

That's correct, Your Honor, and

you have a system where only the police themselves can get

that information, whether it's wrong or right, out of that

they go back and take something out is under this horse-

But the problem for all of us is that there is

so much inaccurate information going into computers, and

there's no housekeeping going on.

QUESTION:

Deterrence, Ms. Carrigan.

How is the

system as a whole deterred?

13

never mind the clerk in the judge's office, how is the

14

system as a whole deterred from being careless if you tell

the system, somebody whom you would not get anyway had

16

this thing been kept off of the computer entirely, if you

17

do get him, we're not going to let you get him?

there would be deterrence, I assume you think there would

MS. CARRIGAN:

By your not saying that

What I'm saying, Your Honor, is,

6

we're not asking that the sheriff's clerks work faster,

7

and we're not saying that somehow justice court employees

8

should make their phone calls in the morning.

9

What we're saying is, possibly, since the

10

authority to arrest comes from a magistrate, the

11

magistrate who issued that warrant issued it because Mr.

12

Evans didn't show up for his traffic tickets.

13

that magistrate, when he quashes the warrant, should be

14

able to push his own button and eliminate that warrant

15

from the system, but he can't because he's not a criminal

justice agency.

QUESTION:

Possibly,

Well, then, as the record of the

argument stands now, you do not contend that any

MS. CARRIGAN:

QUESTION:

It's not

Your Honor --

No, but isn't it true that you impose

6

a cost on society every time you let a person free, and in

7

order to avoid -- just like when you have negligence,

8

there's costs involved, and that if the cost is imposed on

9

the entire society, the entire society will take steps to

10

hire computer operators who are efficient and honest and

11

so forth.
You're not going to deter the individual

12

13

computer operator, but you're -- it's a systemic thing,

14

and there is a cost, whenever you suppress a warrant, on

society as a whole, and the remedy is that society should

make sure these mistakes don't happen.

MS. CARRIGAN:

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Isn't that the most obvious,

In fact, it was very well put.

identifying the cost which you are agreeing with Justice

Stevens that is being imposed upon the society.
It seems to me there is zero cost.

9

The criminal

10

who previously would not be incarcerated because the

evidence would be excluded at his trial will now not be

incarcerated because the warrant will never be in the

What cost have you imposed upon anybody?

MS. CARRIGAN:

MS. CARRIGAN:

None.
If we are doing a cost analysis,

cost to the rest of us of very real possibility of

keep the evidence out of court, would we?

No, Your Honor, you would not.

No, and I don't see how this is

information as it is to be arrested for a computer error,

The informant was wrong?

MS. CARRIGAN:

I -- perhaps I didn't understand

Yes, right.
But it was a confidential,

reliable informant and that is why it passed muster?

13

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

14

MS. CARRIGAN:

That would, indeed, be terrible,

15

and it would be one of the things that happens all too

16

often, unfortunately, but the problem here is, we're not

17

just arguing for exclusion to correct the Fourth Amendment

18

invasion of Mr. Evans, because we know from Leon and

19

Calandra that exclusion is directed, through deterrence,

20

at protecting the rights of other citizens in future

21

encounters with the police, and that's really what this

MS. CARRIGAN:

Well, in Leon -- Leon was

decided,

I believe, because there was a preference for

warrants, and in Leon, the exception was created.

I don't

10

think that this Court has any problem with the idea that

11

their -- that the power of the police cannot be unleashed

12

without any controls, and ordinarily, when the police

13

invade someone's Fourth Amendment rights, that evidence

14

can't be introduced against him at trial.

15

In Leon, what the Court did was say, we would

16

prefer to have officers go for search warrants because

17

there is a measure of control there and there is an

18

assurance that they are at least trying to act in accord

19

with the Fourth Amendment.

20

What we have here is a decision, 17 days

21

later -- 17 days earlier by a magistrate that there was no

22

probable cause for this warrant to be outstanding because

23

Mr. Evans had appeared, so the difference is that we don't

have an independent judicial determination, as we had in

to be arrested without probable cause.

QUESTION:

Well, that's the issue, of course,

10

and Leon spoke in different terms, and so we have to ask

11

why that doesn't control, because we have said that where

the deterrence is such that it justifies excluding the

1

You had said initially Arizona, with this broad

2

language, wasn't having anything to do with the Federal

3

interpretation of the exclusionary rule, that it was

4

deciding this as a matter of State law.

5

no, Arizona in the Fourth Amendment area takes the Federal

6

standard, and that's what it's attempting to apply.

7

you think you have an argument?

8

9

The answer was,

Do

Let's say this would be remanded to the Arizona
supreme court.

Worry about your own constitution, which

10

would then leave Arizona to its new way and not involve

11

any Federal question.

12

MS. CARRIGAN:

We have not abandoned our

13

jurisdictional argument, Your Honor.

14

the decisions and what was argued below by the State and

15

by ourselves in response, what was really argued was a

16

State statute -- that was A.R.S. section 13-3925 -- and it

17

appears at 35a and 36a of the petition's appendix, and

18

what the Arizona court said was, we don't choose to

19

interpret the Arizona good faith statute that way.

20

If you will look at

I think there really is a jurisdictional problem

21

here, and I think there's a problem with remand, because

22

if this Court chooses to remand, then I don't know what

23

the Court will say to the Arizona supreme court about how

24

it should interpret its statute.

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose what the Court would

say, if it accepted the State's submission, was that,

2

proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

3

that it does make a difference if the error stemmed from

4

the judicial side rather than the police side, and so

5

don't decide this case, if you're deciding on the Federal

6

Constitution, on the assumption that even though the error

7

came from the judicial side, the evidence should

8

nonetheless be excluded.

if you have kept it open, any State constitutional

That would obviously leave open,

QUESTION:

11

May I just ask a practical question,

12

and that is this:

13

Maricopa County have any way of maintaining the accuracy

14

of computer records over time independent of what happens

15

in the justice court?

16

do the law enforcement officers in

MS. CARRIGAN:

I think there are two parts to

17

that answer.

18

the individual justice courts call in to the sheriff.

19

second part of that answer is that they don't appear to be

20

doing any housekeeping, and our argument is that they

21

should.

I think that they have set up a system where

If we were to

1

take the position that I guess the Arizona supreme court

2

took and say that it is simply the system's responsibility

3

here, and therefore we don't care where the error is made,

4

there's going to be suppression, because we want to induce

5

the system to get it right, why shouldn't we take exactly

6

the same position in a Leon situation?

7

In a Leon situation, in effect, we are saying,

8

well, the judge may have gotten it wrong, but as long as

9

the police reasonably relied, we will in effect allow the

10

evidence in.

11

position, in a Leon situation say, look, we don't care

12

that it's the judge who made the mistake, we want to

13

induce the system to get judges who will be smart enough

14

to get it right.

15

to overrule Leon?

16

Why shouldn't we, if we accept Arizona's

If we take your position, don't we have

MS. CARRIGAN:

No, indeed, Your Honor, because

17

what Leon says is that we will rest on the assurance that

18

some magistrate or judge doing his job made an assessment

19

on probable cause, but if you look in the Leon decision at

20

page 923, you'll find there are four exceptions to the

21

exception, if you will, and one of those exceptions is if

22

the magistrate abandons his job, or his responsibilities.

23

So I don't believe -- and the first one, very

24

importantly, is where the police are guilty of submitting

25

reckless or false information, and what the court, the

Leon court said about that was that this would be a

reckless disregard for the truth that they would not
