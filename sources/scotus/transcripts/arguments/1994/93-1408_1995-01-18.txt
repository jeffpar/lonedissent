ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. PATRICIA SMITH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. SMITH:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In an effort to contain rising health care costs

13

and assure wide availability of affordable health

14

insurance, New York has long regulated hospitals and other

15

providers in the health care marketplace.

16

traditionally regulated differing segments of the

17

marketplace differently.

18

New York has

While these laws may affect the prices which

19

ERISA plans and others pay for health care services, they

20

do not relate to plans.

21

limit the State's effort to regulate in the health care

22

marketplace, since much State regulation affects costs and

23

therefore may affect choice.

24
25

Any other result would severely

employee benefit plans, there is no indication that

Congress intended to displace traditional State authority-

2

over the regulation of health care, creating a regulatory-

3

vacuum.

4

However, if these types of laws do relate to

5

plans, two of the assessments in this case which are

6

imposed upon hospital bills regulate insurance within the

7

meaning of ERISA's insurance savings clause, because they

8

are designed to moderate insurance rates of certain
insurers in order to support the underwriting and rate-

10

setting practices of open enrollment and community rating

11

which New York has determined allows health insurance to

12

be more widely available at a lower cost.

13

Traditionally, New York has treated different

14

segments of the health care marketplace differently.

New York are covered by ERISA plans, would you think?

The Hospital Association's brief has quoted a

covered - QUESTION:

And what if the effect of New York's

12

law were to sweep in only people covered by ERISA plans?

13

Would your argument change at all?

14

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, if somehow New York's

15

law had a disproportionate impact on ERISA plans, in other

16

words somehow ERISA plans were singled out or treated

17

differently from other purchasers of hospital services,

18

then that would be a different case.

19

more difficult case.

20

That would be a much

But in this case, all of the categories of the

2

Do you think this law can be applied

to ERISA plans that are self-insured?

3

MS. SMITH:

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.
It's a very direct effect, is it not?
Your Honor, the effect on ERISA

6

plans that are self-insured is that it may raise their

7

hospital bills over what they would have been if the law

8

was exactly the same but the payor differentials were
taken out.

I think it's appropriate -QUESTION:

Well, it does even more than that.

No, Your Honor.

They can't be.

not, to enroll Medicaid recipients.

New York is not in any way attempting to

Ms. Smith, one way New York could

Now, suppose New York did that.

that anyone can purchase is from Blue Cross and Blue

That would achieve the same result.
The only health insurance

Would that relate to ERISA plans?
MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, if the marketplace was

7

such that there were -- that would be -- if the

8

marketplace was such that there were many other insurers

out there, and that New York made a rule that said all

small groups must go to Blue Cross, that would relate to

MS. SMITH:

You -Would that be bad, too?
You pay a surcharge if you do go

with Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

You pay the surcharge of

the added cost of open enrollment and community rating.

No, but you're jumping ahead of me.

I just want an answer to that question.

interesting -- interesting way to get things done.

Exorbitantly expensive -- I believe

I answered exorbitantly expensive was not prohibited.

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

QUESTION:

I thought you made a distinction that

10

at some point an inducement could become a requirement.

11

thought that was the position you took in your brief.

12

MS. SMITH:

QUESTION:

The -- but it is -- at some point -You did say that if enrollment in

Blue Cross were required, that would relate to ERISA

MS. SMITH:

QUESTION:

Yes.
And isn't there, in reality, a point

where the toll is so heavy that it becomes, in effect, a

requirement?

20

MS. SMITH:

I

There is a point where you're no

21

longer dealing with economic incentives but that it is

22

regulation in disguise, or it is a regulatory requirement.

23

I don't think that point is simply based on the numbers,

24

whether it's 10 or 20 or 1,000, but there may become a

point where, looking objectively at this statute, it

MS. SMITH:

9

Exorbitantly exorbitant -- yes.

It is not a question of the numbers.

It is not a question of how exorbitant it is, it's a

10

question of looking at the statute and seeing if there's

11

some -- if there is some point where it simply is a sham.

12

It is regulation in disguise.

13

is it 1,000 percent, or 10 percent, or 20 percent.

14

QUESTION:

But it's not a question of,

But why isn't this regulation in

getting anyone who buys insurance to in effect subsidize

Isn't this essentially simply a means of

If that isn't regulation, I

Your Honor -There are many ways to do it.

You

21

can say, everybody has to buy from the same insurer, or

you can say, well, you can buy from some other insurer,

but you're going to help us subsidize the uninsurable by

1

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, historically the insured

2

have always subsidized the uninsured, whether or not it's

3

in the bad -- whether or not it's the fact that the

4

uninsured, when they're cared for in the hospital, end up

5

on the bad debt and charity rolls, and everyone's hospital

6

costs are increased to support the hospital overhead.

7

In unregulated markets, the insured subsidize

8

the uninsured.

Because the Federal Government in the

9

Medicaid program pays the hospitals generally at less than

10

cost, then the insured subsidized the elderly.

11

phenomenon of cost-shifting in the hospital market is an

12

old one, and it exists in all kinds of regulated or

13

unregulated markets.

14

The

One of the purposes of the New York statute was

15

to minimize the cost - shifting.

16

occurred prior to the statute, the differential between

17

Blue Cross and the commercial insurers, was 25 to

18

40 percent, and one of the main purposes of this was to

19

equalize that.

20

QUESTION:

The cost-shifting that

But you're just justifying the

21

regulation.

I'm not suggesting it's not justified.

22

may well be just doing something that would be done by

23

private ordering anyway, but private ordering is not

24

covered by the relating-to clause, and public ordering by

25

law is, so you know, it may well be that it's doing

It

something that the private system would otherwise achieve

2

anyhow.

3

MS. SMITH:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Your Honor, the -But the issue is whether this public

ordering relates to ERISA plans.
MS. SMITH:

The result of that would be the

7

displacement of all hospital rate regulation, because all

8

hospital rate regulation has in their components some,

9

whether it's cost-shifting for the uninsured, or cost-

10

11

shifting for other patients.
In New York's regulatory system, which is not

12

challenged here, for instance, besides a bad debt and

13

charity component, which one could consider be cost-

14

shifting, there's a component that for excess malpractice,

15

which could be considered to be cost - shifting to protect

16

doctors who have committed malpractice, there's a

17

component for rural initiatives, which would be considered

18

cost-shifting from -- to hospitals where there are -- to

19

rural hospitals.

20

So if the result is that New York may not cost-

21

shift in any manner, then it's going to be very difficult

22

for New York to regulate in the hospital area.

difficult for any State to regulate in this area if - -

Suppose New York had a very substantial, very

2

heavy surcharge on plans that did not cover pregnancy

3

benefits, or did not cover mental health, would that be

4

permissible?

5

Metropolitan holding?

Would that be a way to get around the Shaw-

MS. SMITH:

6

Yes, that would -- if there was a

7

surcharge, instead of restricting the plans' choice of not

8

9

policy without pregnancy, if the State put a surcharge --

QUESTION:

They could structure

So it's a formalistic analysis rather

15

than a pragmatic economic analysis that governs us in

determining whether there's preemption?

17

MS. SMITH:

What governs you is the purpose of

18

ERISA preemption, which is to provide that plans may be

19

able to choose on a multi-State basis their structure and

20

So long as the State is not dictating or

restricting the choices, they may place economic

MS. SMITH:

Yes.
That seems to be what you're saying.
Unless -- unless the pragmatic

economic inquiry is such that the State, although it

appears that its incentive is in the marketplace, is

actually foreclosing everyone's choice.

QUESTION:

But --

QUESTION:

But if that's all that Congress

meant, which is a very narrow thing, it could have

expressed that by the choice of a much different phrase

than relating to.

15

an enormously broad phrase.

QUESTION:

7

MS. SMITH:

No, Your Honor.
Okay, good.
Whether or not ERISA plans are

8

25 percent or 60 percent or 88 percent of the marketplace

9

shouldn't make a difference in this case.

10

ERISA plans are there not by operation of law

11

but because this is a benefit area, and under that sort of

12

theory that the larger percentage they are of the

13

marketplace the less the State is able to regulate ERISA

14

plans, sort of as, by the dint of their collective

15

purchasing power occupy the marketplace and therefore

16

displace the State from regulation, I don't think there

17

was any intent that Congress when it passed ERISA, and

18

ERISA plans were a larger percentage of the economic

19

health care marketplace then, was intending to displace

20

the States from health care authority because they

21

constituted a large percentage of the marketplace.

It's

1

that they have -- they're a large percentage of the

2

marketplace, and the very object of this plan is in a

3

significant way to effect a decision of a matter that's at

4

the heart of their very existence, what kind of insurance

5

they buy, or what -- who they buy it from.
That is, there's nothing more important than

6

7

that to them, and the purpose of the New York law is

8

significantly to affect that choice.

9

that this has a big practical impact.
MS. SMITH:

10

That's the argument

Two points, Your Honor.

First of

11

all, the point of New York law is not to -- and its

12

objective purpose, the way it works, is not to drive

13

everyone to Blue Cross, it is to level the playing field.

14

It is to make Blue Cross as competitive as anyone else,

15

not more competitive than anyone else.

16

QUESTION:

Do we have a record that allows us to

17

judge whether in fact the act is carrying out an

18

equalization purpose rather than a shifting purpose?

19

MS. SMITH:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, you do, Your Honor.
What do we know -- what do we know

21

about the resulting rates?

I mean, is -- presumably

22

you're going to say, well, Blue Cross is higher anyway, so

23

that the surcharge does not have the effect of driving

24

people away as it would if the rates were equal, to start

25

with.

Do we have that in the record?

MS. SMITH:

1

What we know in the record is that

2

commercial insurers, even after the surcharges, offer

3

lower rates.
The other thing that we can see in the record is

4
5

that in years where the commercial insurance rates were

6

going up, again with the surcharges, 7.5 percent, Blue

7

Cross rates were going up 28 percent.
QUESTION:

8
9

Maybe they're very inefficient.

Maybe they're enormously inefficient, and the reason

10

people are buying this other insurance is they do a better

11

job.

12

compete in the marketplace.

13

because we're better.

14

They charge -- I mean, that's how any businesses

MS. SMITH:

We can provide it for less

We do it more efficiently.
The record also shows that the

15

commercials do it more efficiently and better because when

16

you exclude the high risks you save 30 percent on your

17

premiums, so that the reason that the Blues' rates are

18

higher are because they do insure the higher risks.

19

QUESTION:

Is there something in the record that

20

shows that is the only reason for the differential between

21

the Blues and the commercial insurers?

22

MS. SMITH:

The commercial insurers have

23

indicated that the reason for the differential is to pay

24

Blue Cross for the added costs of open enrollment and

25

community rating.

Well, I'm sure that's the purpose,

but is there anything in the record that shows that it

3

doesn't go beyond what is necessary to achieve that

4

purpose?

5

MS. SMITH:

I would think that the -- the record

shows that it didn't achieve the purpose, and that's why

7

the State felt it necessary to impose for the 1-year

8

period the 11 percent.

QUESTION:

Is your essential point that New York

10

is attempting to regulate health care, ERISA plans happen

11

to be a large part of that market, but that New York would

12

be doing essentially the same thing in that -- were there

13

no ERISA plans, and that if you read related-to as any

that it was intended to preempt the field of benefit --

employee benefit plan regulation and to prevent employee

benefit plans from conflicting and inconsistent

15

As a matter of both common sense and tradition,

MR. KNEEDLER:

understand the way the ERISA preemption clause operates,

it is primarily designed to preserve for Federal

themselves, their internal operations, their internal

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that would raise a more

MR. KNEEDLER:

It would be saved by the insurance savings clause.
But what it does is, it constricts, perhaps, the

2

3

choices available to the ERISA plan when it is going out

4

into the market, but it does not reach into the ERISA plan

5

and dictate the choice or create impermissible incentives

6

for the ERISA plan to choose among the options that are

please the Court:

2

When Congress enacted ERISA, it made a

3

determination that ERISA plans, the type of benefits they

4

offer and the systems that an employer uses to deliver

5

those benefits, should be left to the decision of the

6

employer.

7

Congress therefore, when it enacted ERISA's

8

preemption clause, used a very broad formulation, the

9

formulation being, does a State law relate to any ERISA

10
11

plan?
I think Justice Souter's exorbitant-exorbitant

12

formulation would be a question that might have some

13

interest and meaning in this case in the context of a

14

regulating formulation, but Congress made the decision

15

here not to preempt only those laws which regulate ERISA

16

plans, which in my view any kind of an exorbitant -

17

exorbitant surcharge would, but made the determination to

18

preempt any law which relates to an ERISA plan.

19

The State's entire argument in this case comes

20

down to the point that to fall within ERISA's relating-to

21

clause, a law has to restrict or dictate plan choice.

In Morales - - and I speak to Morales with some

MR. MURPHY:

1

My general statement is, with

2

regard to those things what the State is doing is, they

3

are regulating an upstream supplier of ERISA plans in a

4

way which simply has an indirect impact on the plan.

5

In this case, what they are doing is

6

fundamentally different.

7

doing here is, it is imposing an assessment on the amount

8

a plan pays in hospital benefits, and it's making the

What the State of New York is

amount of that assessment turn on the very plan -- the
10

very form the plan adopts to deliver its benefits.
Under subdivision 1, section 3 of ERISA, an

11
12

ERISA plan is defined to be an arrangement, through the

13

purchase of insurance or otherwise, by which an employer

14

provides his employees with hospital care, among other

15

benefits.

16

The two essential characteristics of an ERISA

17

plan are its delivery of hospital care through an

18

arrangement, insurance or otherwise, and in this case,

1

these statutes impose a surcharge on the very benefit,

20

hospital care, which makes a plan a plan, and makes the

21

amount of that assessment turn on the fundamental decision

22

of the plan as to how best to deliver its benefits.

23

What we're dealing with here is simply a State

24

which has decided to try to drive the conduct of ERISA

25

plans by using a system of economic sanctions rather than

QUESTION:

2

According to New York, they're trying

3

to regulate the availability of medical care to patients,

4

even high risk patients, even Medicaid patients, and

5

the -- and to control costs.

6

guess that that was New York's purpose?

7

MR. MURPHY:

Are we to say -- to second-

Your Honor, that was their purpose,

8

although I disagree with the statement that they were

9

trying to control costs when they imposed what are in

10

effect taxes on hospital services, but the way they tried

11

to provide hospital care to the needy here was by making

12

ERISA plans operating in New York use New York's

13

financially distressed Blue Cross-Blue Shield system.

14

They can't do that directly by mandating it,

15

nor, under a relating-to formulation, can they do the same

16

thing by imposing a series of economic sanctions.

17
18

QUESTION:

Did that in fact result?

Did they

make ERISA plans switch to Blue Cross en masse?

19

MR. MURPHY:

Well, that was the purpose of the

20

laws.

21

looks at the affidavits from the State officials and the

22

Blue Cross people who were responsible for these laws,

23

there's no doubt that was the purpose.

In fact, if Your Honor reads the appendix here and

what was happening, Your Honor, is, in the late 1980's,

2

Blue Cross was experiencing a financial crisis.

argue and debate what the cause of that crisis was,

whether it was mismanagement, as Justice Souter noted, or

some other things.

The fact is, ERISA plans --

I thought the purpose was to make

8

Blue Cross a more viable choice, not to make it the -- in

9

effect, to require Blue Cross in lieu of commercial

10

insurers.
MR. MURPHY:

11

That is correct, Your Honor, but

12

the way New York chose to make it more viable was to give

13

ERISA plans an incentive to switch their coverage from

14

either self-insurance or commercial insurance to Blue

15

Cross.

16

QUESTION:

Could they have done it in a

17

different way, simply by requiring all insurers,

18

commercial, including those who insure ERISA, simply to

19

adopt those characteristics of Blue Cross which had

20

broadened the coverage and hence made it difficult for

21

Blue Cross, the community rating and open enrollment, and

22

so on?

23

MR. MURPHY:

Your Honor, effective April 1st,

QUESTION:

Well then, why doesn't this, too,

because if your basic argument, which I think personally

is a very strong one, is that the whole purpose of this

way the ERISA's plans' and others' choices of which

commercial companies to adopt the characteristics like
open enrollment, et cetera, then why doesn't that very

10

argument, insofar as it's accepted, require us also to

11

think that what's happening is the regulation of

insurance?

13

MR. MURPHY:

Well, because when you deal with

open enrollment and community rating, or the law in New

15

York, what the State has said to insurance companies is,

16

this is what you have to do.

17

In this case -- and, you know, I'll just call

18

your attention to the Metropolitan Life case, where this

Court pointed out that mandated mental health benefits was

a regulation of insurance, 1) because it established the

terms of the insurance contract and 2) because it imposed

you regulated insurance, that would display itself in

MR. MURPHY:

I believe it would, but again, Your

5

Honor, what this Court has made clear in its cases under

6

both the ERISA savings clause and under the McCarran-

7

Ferguson Act, that the purpose of the exception we're

dealing with here was not to make the States supreme in

all matters relating to insurance companies.

The purpose

10

was to give the States regulatory authority on - - over the

11

actual contract of insurance.

QUESTION:

Why is that?

I mean, you have quite

13

a good answer, actually, but I thought that if you're

14

reading the words "relate to" to say, let's look to the

15

practical impact of this, the practical impact is that it

16

affects the insurance contract, makes it get much more

Why wouldn't you read the word "regulate"

In determining whether a law falls within the

3
4

savings clause, this Court has essentially done two

5

things.

6

dictates any of the terms of the insurance policy.

7

instance, Metropolitan Life, the law fell within the

insurance savings clause because it imposed the terms of

that that law was intimately associated with the

held it was not a regulation of insurance because it

didn't actually set the terms of the contract.

19

Despite the fact

The other thing - - and in response to the

20

question you asked earlier, Justice Breyer, let me explain

21

why the courts have focused on the contract of insurance.

22

In 1869, this Court decided a case -- Paul v. Virginia.

23

In that case, it held that the insurance contract was a

24

transaction outside of interstate commerce and couldn't be

25

regulated by the Federal Government.

In 1944, in the Southeast Underwriters case,

2

this Court overruled that decision, and held the

3

transaction, the transaction being the contract of

insurance, was in commerce.
In enacting the McCarran-Ferguson Act, all

Congress wanted to do was to give back to the States their

regulatory authority over the contract of insurance, and

8

this Court has repeatedly held, in National Securities and

a number of other cases, that the States do not have

10

regulatory authority with regard to all matters affecting

insurance companies.
In fact, in Royal Drug, this Court held that the

13

relationship between the insurance company and the

14

supplier of medical services, in that case pharmacies, was

MR. MURPHY:

2

Well, Your Honor, again, because

under ERISA's savings clause and the McCarran-Ferguson

Act, what you're doing is, you're making the States

5

supreme with regard to the regulation of insurance, and

6

again, in Royal Drug -- and let me just emphasize this.

7

When you say something is the business of insurance, it

8

means not only that the States -- it falls within ERISA's
savings clause and therefore by that act States can

10

regulate ERISA plans.
It means that the conduct at issue is exempt

11

12

from the antitrust laws, and it also means, under section

13

2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, that any time there is

14

a conflict between Federal and State law, State law

prevails.

are reversed.

In other words, the normal rules of preemption

17

For all of those reasons, the savings clause has

18

been construed narrowly, and again, I will just note, Your

1

Honor, in Royal Drug, the practice at issue was completely

20

about regulating the costs of an insurance company, what

21

it paid under its pharmacy agreements, so that it could

22

make insurance more available at a lower price, and this

Court held that the agreements were not the business of

insurance because they did not dictate the terms of the

insurance contract.

MR. ISELIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Unlike the 13- and 11-percent surcharges, the

10

-percent assessment that is imposed exclusively on HMO's

11

and on the employee benefit plans they serve has nothing

12

to do with New York State's hospital reimbursement system

13

or the rates that are paid to hospitals.

14

Thus, even if petitioners' concerns about the

15

effect this case might have on the State's hospital

16

reimbursement system were relevant to the issue of ERISA

17

preemption, such concerns are clearly irrelevant to the

18

issue of whether the

What is more, the State has conceded that the savings

clause does not apply to the

the only question the Court must address is whether the

22

-percent assessment relates to employee benefit plans.

Where the

-percent assessment is preempted.

-percent assessment.

Thus,

-percent assessment is similar to the

24

13- and 11-percent surcharges is that all three interfere

25

with one of the most basic decisions an ERISA plan makes,

namely, how best to provide health care coverage to

MR. ISELIN:

It's not attempting to get

Well, Your Honor, the purpose, the

stated purpose of the statutes may be somewhat different,
10

but the effect is identical, because both sets of cases

11

have the State imposing surcharges that are interfering

12

with the decisions ERISA plans want to make as to how best

13

to provide health care, and one of the things, again, that

14

the statute itself talks about, is delivering hospital,

15

medical, or surgical benefits through the purchase of

16

insurance or otherwise.

17

Now, surely the "otherwise" applies to self-

18

insured, to HMO's, to other types of coverage that are

different from insurance.

21

the State's purpose with the

different, the effect on ERISA plans remains the same.

MR. ISELIN:

They can't regulate them in a way

that would -- that would relate to, and that would --

relate to ERISA plans and interfere with the choice ERISA

plans make.

MR. ISELIN:

10

That they can't require them,

11

again, in a manner that would interfere with the choices

12

or the quality of care that's provided by the HMO, which

13

could also happen if the State required HMO's to enroll

14

Medicaid recipients in a manner that overburdened the

15

delivery system of the HMO, which can --

1

think any system that relies on targets and compels HMO's

2

to take Medicaid recipients in that manner is problematic,

3

because again, HMO's have a limited capacity to deliver

4

care.

5

Some may -QUESTION:

The effect of your argument is that

6

the HMO's, by virtue of the relating-to-ERISA-plan

7

language, really escape virtually all the regulation on

8

the subjects that we're talking about, whereas the

9

insurance companies would not.

10

MR. ISELIN:

No, Your Honor, because what we

11

have here for HMO's is the Federal HMO Act, and the

12

Federal HMO Act on many of these issues acts as a sort of

13

HMO savings clause because it specifically authorized

14

States to conduct regulation of HMO's in many aspects

15

similar to what we talked about earlier, community rating

16

being one very good example.

17

Now, that act was passed just 1 year before

18

ERISA, and I think when you read the two together, the

19

Federal HMO Act preserves for the States actually a fairly

20

high level of regulation of HMO's, but it does not

21

preserve differing assessments on what HMO's pay, thereby

22

interfering with employee benefit plans.

23

There are four specific ways that the 9-percent

24

also very directly interferes with the choice, and since

25

my time is running short, I'd like to talk about one in

1

particular, and one result, when you increase costs in

2

this way and it gets passed through from the HMO to

3

employee benefit plans, is not just that the plans pay

4

more, but they also can restructure benefits, increase

5

copayments and, particularly important, sometimes plans

6

drop coverage altogether.

7

This is particularly common with small

8

businesses, who might be right at the margin of whether

9

they even provide coverage.

10

An HMO tends to be the lowest

cost option in the market.

11

Thus, when we think about the impact, it's not

12

enough just to think about it as increasing costs, which

13

it certainly does here, but also reducing benefits, which

14

is very analogous to Met Life, and in fact causing some

15

employee benefit plans to just say, we have no more money

16

to pay this added cost.

17

We can't increase our coinsurance or our

18

copayments because they're at the maximum, we can't strip

19

away any more benefits because we're at the minimum level

20

of benefits that we can provide through the HMO.

21

choice we have left now is to discontinue coverage.

The only

22

And one of the ironic things of the State's

23

position is that at the same time that it's trying to

24

increase coverage, and is arguing for that as a

25

justification for these assessments, the actions may have

1

the exact opposite effect, which is to price some employee

2

benefit plans, and particularly those of small business,

3

right out of the market.

4

Finally, I'd like to touch briefly on the

5

Metropolitan Life case, because as some have noted, it's

6

directly analogous here, particularly on the compelling

7

versus inducing point, and again, one of the options in

8

Metropolitan Life, faced with having to pay for the mental

9

health benefit at issue, was that plans had two choices.

10

They could either move to self-insurance, which was

11

directly recognized in that decision, or they could take

12

this other option which I just described, which is to

13

simply drop coverage.

14

The law in Metropolitan Life, which the Court

15

recognized related to employee benefit plans, was no more

16

compulsory than the assessments at issue here.

17

still retained options, and they could have chosen to

18

exercise those options, just as ERISA plans here may have

19

some theoretical options.
