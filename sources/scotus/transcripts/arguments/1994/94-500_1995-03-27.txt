ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Under section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue

12

Code, damages received on account of personal injury or

13

sickness are excluded from tax.

14

whether back wages and liquidated damages awarded under

15

the Age Discrimination and Employment Act are excluded

16

from tax under this statute.

17

This case concerns

A closely analogous question was presented to

18

the Court just three terms ago in United States v. Burke.

19

That case involved application of section 104(a)(2) to a

20

back wage award on a sex discrimination claim.

21

court concluded in Burke, although employment

22

discrimination obviously may affect a personal interest,

23

the statutory back wages remedy involved in that case

24

compensated only the employee's economic loss.

25

provided no compensation for the personal components of

As the

It

1

the employee's injury, such as pain and suffering and

2

emotional distress.

3

What the court concluded in Burke was that a

4

statutory remedy that focuses in this manner on the

5

economic rather than the personal components of the

6

employee's injury does not yield damages on account of

7

personal injury within the meaning of section 104(a)(2).

8

9

Now, the analysis applied by this Court in Burke
is also applicable to the present case.

Under the ADEA,

10

there are two types of money recoveries, back wages of the

11

type that this Court concluded were not excluded from

12

income in Burke, and liquidated damages in an amount equal

13

to the back wages award but only in cases involving wilful

14

violations of the act.

15

Pain and suffering, emotional distress, and

16

other similar personal components of the employee's injury

17

are not compensable or even admissible in an ADA suit.

18

QUESTION:

But you do have a tort-like remedy in

19

the sense that you have in effect punitive damages, and

20

that's tort, that's not contract.

21

MR. JONES:

The tort-like remedy is to be a

22

tort-like remedy for a personal injury.

23

was a tort-like remedy in Burke, the Court focused on the

24

absence of any remedy for the personal components, pain

25

and suffering.

In deciding what

The Court also mentioned jury trials and

1

punitive damages, but those are very weak indicators of

2

whether the underlying claim is a tort-like claim for a

3

personal injury.
QUESTION:

4
5

But they get us -- they get us

outside the simple ambit of Burke, though.
MR. JONES:

6

No, I don't think so.

Actually,

7

Justice Souter, your concurring opinion in Burke stated

8

what we believe is the correct interpretation.
QUESTION:

That was not the majority opinion.

MR. JONES:

No, you state in your concurring

12

QUESTION:

I thought it was very good, but --

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. JONES:

9
10
11

opinion --

What I'm trying to say is that in

15

your concurring opinion you said that the majority holds

16

that what determines a tort-like claim is whether -- is

17

solely whether the claim remedies the personal components

18

of the employee's loss, and we think that's the correct

19

interpretation of Burke.
As I was saying, punitive damages can be awarded

20
21

even in cases involving economic torts, but the indicator

22

of whether it's a tort for a personal injury is whether it

23

provides compensation for the personal elements of the

24

injury.

25

This is a common application of a very basic

1

principle of the tax law, which is that because exclusions

2

from income are to be narrowly interpreted, the -- in

3

determining whether the transaction fits within the

4

exclusion, you have to determine whether it not only meets

5

the form, but meets the substance of what the statute's

6

designed to protect, and it's in that respect that the

7

tort-like remedy has to remedy the personal component of

8

the injury because if it only remedies the economic

9

component, then it may in form look like a personal

10

injury, but in substance it's just an economic award and

11

should be taxed just like all other economic awards.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Jones, is it not the case that

13

age discrimination claims are sometimes joined with title

14

VII claims?

15

For example, sex discrimination claims?

MR. JONES:

It may be that there are

16

independently violations of those two separate statutes,

17

but there's no -QUESTION:

18

But my question is, if you can bring

19

both claims, as I understand you can, and this will cover

20

settlements as well as litigated cases, then can't the

21

parties manipulate themselves in and out of tax

22

consequences by either putting the damages under title VII

23

in their settlement papers or under the age discrimination

24

act?

There is an ample body of case law addressing

Now, it is true that the allocation made by the

7

parties is sort of, if you will, ordinarily respected, but

8

if there's evidence of what you described as manipulation,

9

certainly the Commissioner would reallocate the award and

10

make a deficiency based upon what he -- what she

11

understands to be the substance of the party's claims.

14

QUESTION:

How are Equal Pay Act cases treated

in this regime that the Commissioner is now administering?
MR. JONES:

I have to admit that's a very

15

difficult question for me because I'm not 100 percent

16

confident on the remedial scheme of the Equal Pay Act.

17

I think -- well, let me assume that it's like

18

the Fair Labor Standards Act.

I know that like the ADA it

19

refers to some of the remedies under the Fair Labor

20

Standards Act, but if it were like the Fair Labor

21

Standards Act, where you had liquidated damages that were

22

automatically awarded as additional compensation, rather

23

than as, under this statute as a -- only for wilful

24

violations, even so, that compensation would not be

in addition for personal loss is important in applying the

3

statute to all types of remedies.

4

Now, in the area of employment discrimination,

5

Congress has drawn certain distinctions between different

types of remedies.

7

distinctions that Congress drew, just as this Court did in

8

Burke.

9

We're simply respecting the

In Burke the Court said that a title VII

10

recovery, which at that time compensated only for economic

11

losses and not for personal losses, was not excluded, so I

12

believe that the question that you're asking was really

13

anticipated or was indeed the subject of Burke.

what the Court concluded in Burke.

QUESTION:

That's

And even if we take title VII itself,

MR. JONES:

18

QUESTION:

1991.
Even two parts of title VII, I

19

believe your position is that if it's intent

20

discrimination then it's excludable, but if it's impact,

21

then it's not excludable, and those two are often pled in

22

the alternative.

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

25

Certainly.
I think it's an intent case, but if I

don't make it on that, then it's an impact case.

MR. JONES:

1

It would be inconsistent with Burke

2

to regard the disparate impact case which provides only

3

for back wages to be excluded from income.

4

What happened in 1991 was that Congress provided

5

additional remedies for the intentional discrimination

6

case, the compensatory damages, including compensation for

7

these personal components of loss.

8

Court -- I'm sorry, Congress identified that claim as in

9

substance as well as in form a remedy for personal

In doing so, the

10

injuries.

11

economic remedy, just as it does under the ADEA, so in

12

substance what Congress did was leave that as an economic

13

recovery.

14

For disparate impact cases, it provides only an

QUESTION:

So but you're largely, then, leaving

15

it, at least as far as settlement is concerned, up to the

16

parties when you have, it could be one or could be the

17

other, and good faith you could plead one or the other,

18

but for settlement purposes you'll pick the one with the

19

advantageous tax consequences.

20

MR. JONES:

As I have already explained, the

21

Service's only tool in that situation is to enforce what

22

it believes to be the substance of the party's recoveries.

23

Sometimes you can tell.

Sometimes it's

24

relatively visible that there's been a contrivance, but if

25

there hasn't been a contrivance, I suppose what that would

1

suggest is that the remedy in fact was for the personal

2

component of the loss, if both were available.

3

Now, if I could get to this case, the courts

4

below agreed with the framework of analysis that I've

5

described.

6

liquidated damages component of the age discrimination act

7

recovery was in a -- was an indirect, implied form of

8

compensation for the personal component of the employee's

9

loss, but that conclusion is not correct.

They differed only in a conclusion that the

10

In TWA v. Thurston, the Court explained that ADA

11

liquidated damages are a double damages device designed to

12

punish and to deter wilful violations of the act.

13

Court explained that the liquidated damages for wilful

14

violations of the ADA are a direct substitute for the

15

criminal sanctions for wilful violations of the Fair Labor

16

Standard Act, from which the ADA remedies were largely

17

drawn.

The

18

So the ADA liquidated damages remedy is not an

19

automatic award given as additional compensation in each

20

case, as it was under the pre-1946 provisions of the Fair

21

Labor Standards Act that were involved in the Court's

22

decisions in Brooklyn Savings and Overnight Motor.

23

And in Thurston, in distinguishing those older

24

FLSA cases, the Court specifically pointed out that

25

liquidated damages for wilful violations are a

Now, the Seventh Circuit in Downey added

something very useful on this topic.

The

24

came out of contracts, but I think that what we have to --

25

what -- Lorillard v. Pons is helpful in understanding

1

what's going on here.

2

In Lorillard v. Pons, the Court pointed out that

3

when FLSA remedies were drawn into the ADEA, to the extent

4

that they were drawn in without change they should be

5

given a similar interpretation, but to the extent they

6

were drawn in with the change, they should be given a

7

different interpretation, and in Lorillard v. Pons, the

8

Court specifically pointed out that liquidated damages

9

under the FLSA had meant something, but now it's something

10

different under the ADEA.

11

I think that what happened was that the term

12

"liquidated damages" just came along from the FLSA, but

13

the concept was changed into a substitute for the criminal

14

remedy.

15

I -QUESTION:

Liquidated damages in traditional

16

contract law often means a sum that is awarded because the

17

actual damages would be very difficult to assess, doesn't

18

it?

19

MR. JONES:

That's correct.

I think as an

20

ordinary contract remedy that would be the concept that it

21

addresses, but as I pointed out, when it came along into

22

the ADEA, it really changed its nature, and as the Court

23

said in Thurston, it became punitive in nature and a

24

substitute for criminal sanctions.

I didn't --

in Burke did not think that your regulation making the

held that it was.

MR. JONES:

11

Well, the point that we're -- the

12

distinction I'm trying to make when I talk about wilful is

13

whether the resulting award is compensation for the

14

underlying injury or compensation -- or rather, not

15

compensation, but punishment for the employer's

16

misconduct.

17

QUESTION:

Well, you could say the same about

assault.

19

or punishing the bad intent.

20

and it's the same here.

21

I don't know whether you're punishing the injury

MR. JONES:

They both have to be there,

I think the difference is that when

22

the statute refers to injury, I think it's in the legal --

23

context of the legal injury.

injury isn't just the harm, it's the occurrence of the

25

conditions that give rise to the action.

In an assault, the legal

1

Punitive damages are not based upon the legal

2

injury to the defendant, they're based on punishment of

3

the improper state of mind of the defendant.

4

QUESTION:

I think --

These aren't punitive damages.

5

They're liquidated damages, which as the Chief just

6

suggested measure a given in lieu -- because damages are

7

hard to measure, not punishment.

8

9

MR. JONES:

Sometimes, but I think what I was

trying to point out is it's reasonably clear that in

10

dragging this term along into the ADEA it wasn't

11

describing the contractual historical notion of liquidated

12

damages.

13

indeed, that this was a punitive sanction designed to

14

deter and punish.

15

That's exactly what the Court held in Thurston,

It changed its nature as it moved along, but as

16

the Seventh Circuit explained, whether you regard it as

17

compensation or as punishment, it doesn't compensate for

18

the personal components of the loss.

19

doesn't have the form or the substance of compensation for

20

the personal components of the employee --

It's like Burke.

question that I think the Commissioner would answer it

17

I would not consider the touchstone of tort-like to be

18

whether you are entitled to pain and suffering damages.

19

MR. JONES:

Well, again, you have to focus on

20

just not tort-like, but the context of this is tort-like

21

remedy for a personal injury.

22

If we unleash the word tort-like from the

23

context of personal injury, then we include it, I suppose,

24

perhaps in antitrust remedies, perhaps securities laws,

25

anything that's not based on contract.

What the regulation does is it directs the

1

2

distinction to be made between whether the statute is just

3

providing an economic remedy or is providing a remedy for

4

the personal components of the loss.
There are two other points that I'd like to

5

briefly make.

7

QUESTION:

May I take it that the Commissioner

8

then, despite Justice Scalia's opinion, had no occasion to

Under 104(a)(2) it has to be damages

interpreted to require there to be a tort or tort-like

overrun the various components of the statute.

Here we're just talking about the one, and in

deciding whether this kind of recovery has both the form

it's been interpreted in that fashion.

There's one other point that I just

have to talk about briefly, because it's a very important

point to the Commissioner, and that is that liquidated

reason, which is that their award only for wilful

violations is analogous to punitive damages and private

that the

range of damages in these three statutes are roughly

the reason which I think has ultimately been recognized by

action, as the regulations state, once that occurs, any

damages, as the statute says, are excludable, and the IRS

now explicitly applies that principle to lost earnings or

back pay under title VII, the disabilities act, et cetera.

Was both the emphasis in Burke on jury trial and the

emphasis on some range of headings of damages intended to

point to a case like the typical tort personal injury case

in which the jury has a considerable degree of discretion

in determining what something is worth, e.g., what pain

and suffering is worth, whereas in a case like this,

must be instructed with respect to the wage aspect of the

which is pretty much a mathematical exercise if the jury

2

follows its instructions?

And number 2, assuming that it finds wilfulness,

the wilfulness once again is pretty much a matter of math

once the wage claim has been given a figure, isn't that

correct?

And if that is so, is this really the

kind of case which the Court had in mind when it was

pointing to the sort of discretionary valuation that

11

juries make, and if the answer is no, then perhaps even

12

though the jury and some panoply of remedy features are

13

satisfied here, this still wouldn't fall within what Burke

14

was getting at.

Well, the reason I think that is not

17

cite the Rickel case, an age discrimination appellate

decision, and the court also had as a background, as it

19

were, the post 1991 amendments showing how the addition of

20

certain features to a remedial scheme can apparently

21

transform the character of the damages.

22

There is a role for the jury in the age case.

23

The jury not only finds whether discrimination may occur,

but the jury has a role in the determination of wilfulness

on the part of the defendant.

But if the Court thought that -- if

21

the Court thought that jury discretion in a different

22

sense, discretion in weighing evidence to determine in the

23

first place whether there had been a discrimination and,

24

in the second place, whether it was wilful was important,

25

then there would have been no need, I suppose, to

emphasize the range of damages too, and when you get to

the range of damages, isn't that a signal that what the

Court was really talking about was a discretion that goes

MR. JOYCE:

7

QUESTION:

Well --- to the kind of discretion that we

8

speak of in terms of valuation, which does not seem to be

9

present here?

10

MR. JOYCE:

I understand Your Honor's point.

11

still don't think that's what the Court really had in

12

mind, because if that were so, various other presumed

13

damages such as defamation, defamation per se, that

14

doctrine, would automatically be excluded from the reach

15

of this statute, and as I indicated earlier, even other

16

tort-like statutes such as wrongful death are

17

automatically beyond the reach, unless they provide a

18

separate count.

19

QUESTION:

I

No, but in the presumed damages case,

20

damages are presumed but the jury has to set the amount,

21

whereas here, the jury does not have that kind of

22

discretion.

23

this, if the jury follows its instructions, is essentially

24

a matter of the arithmetic.

25

The amount we're talking about in cases like

It is a matter of arithmetic once

there's a finding of wilfulness.

QUESTION:

3

MR. JOYCE:

Yes.
And as to whether, for that matter,

4

Congress decided to leave the apparent equation of the

5

degree of reprehensibility to the existence of damages,

6

though the Court in the Schmitz case, for example,

7

concluded that that was in fact what was going on, that

8

there is a presumed association with a degree of bad

9

conduct on the part of the tortfeasor with those

10

additional damages suffered by the plaintiff, and there is

11

a role, a very distinct role for jury discretion in that

12

case, Your Honor.

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no further
questions, I cede the remainder of my time.

Mr. Jones, you have 2 minutes remaining.

Thank you, Mr. Joyce.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. JONES:

Thank you.

20

Just briefly, Justice Ginsburg, I wanted to

21

point out that the irony that you referred to may be even

22

broader than you noted.

23

under Norfolk and Western, if the recovery were tax-exempt

24

the jury should be instructed of that, is the fact that

25

under Brooklyn Savings, if the reward were excluded from

2

prejudgment interest would not be permitted.
Currently, pre-judgment interest is allowed on

3
4

ADEA claims because the liquidated damages component is

5

regarded as punitive rather than as compensatory, but if

6

it were regarded as exempt because it compensated for

7

personal losses, it would fall precisely within the

8

Brooklyn Savings holding that precludes prejudgment

9

interest.
There are two steps involved in applying this

statute, as there are in almost every tax statute that

provides an exclusion from income.

14

both the form and the substance that Congress describes.

15

The form of such a transaction in this context

Because such statutes

16

is the nature of the claim, the Threlkeld test.

17

went beyond the form of the claim in Burke and said it

18

also has to meet the substance of the statute.

19

provide remedies for the personal components of the loss,

because otherwise, if it just compensates for the economic

components, it doesn't fall within the scope of the

statute as it should be strictly construed.

we disagree with the respondent about whether we had been

2

inconsistent.

3

on it for that, but I do want to point out specifically

4

that since 1972, in rulings involving what was then title

5

VII provisions and FLSA provisions, the Service ruled that

6

if the statutory remedy only provides back wages and an

7

equal amount of liquidated damages and doesn't compensate

8

for the personal components, then it's not a recovery on

9

account of personal injuries.

I think that our brief -- I'll have to rely

It's not a tort-like remedy

May I ask one question?

What is the

Service position for recovery in a tort of somebody

damages are totally economic?

MR. JONES:

Well, as you've described it, I'm

confident that our position would be that it is an

economic recovery, but I'm not --
