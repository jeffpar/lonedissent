CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

3

We'll hear argument

4

first this morning in Number 93- 783, the Director of the

5

Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. the Newport

News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company.

Ms. Brinkmann.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BRINKMANN:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns the standing of the Director

12

3

of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs to seek

4

judicial review of rulings by the Benefits Review Board of

5

claims under the Longshore & Harbor Workers' Compensation

6

Act.

7

The Director has standing to seek court-of-

8

appeals review as a person adversely affected or aggrieved

9

by a final board ruling under 33 U.S.C. 92 (c).

20

The Director is charged with a myriad of duties

21

under the act.

22

her ability to carry out those duties consistent with her

23

interpretation of the act when that interpretation differs

24

from the board ruling.

25

Incorrect board rulings adversely affect

QUESTION:

Is it true, Ms. Brinkmann, that both

1

the Director and the board are located within the Labor

2

Department?
MS. BRINKMANN:

3

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

It's

4

somewhat analogous to the situation of the Occupational

5

Safety & Health Review Commission, which came before the

6

Court in Martin.
Although that Commission was an independent

7
8

Commission, it was a situation in which Congress had taken

9

the adjudicatory authority for a program and vested it

10

somewhere other than where the administrative and

11

enforcement authority was.

12

administrative and enforcement authority are vested in the

13

Director, where the adjudicative authority is vested in

14

the Commission.

As in this case, the

15

QUESTION:

16

appointees of the Secretary?

17

And are both -- are all of them

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor, but in this

18

particular case, it's different than what one might think

19

is a traditional agency structure in that it's not a

20

unitary structure, and that the administrator and enforcer

21

of the act cannot overrule the Benefits Review Board

22

decisions.

23

situation before the Court in Martin.

24
25

That's why we believe it's analogous to the

QUESTION:

Now, can the Secretary change rules

if a situation arises in the board's interpretation that

the Secretary doesn't like?

MS. BRINKMANN:

QUESTION:

MS. BRINKMANN:

5

QUESTION:

6

Rulemaking is possible?
Yes, Your Honor, but --

And I assume the Secretary relies on

the Director for advice on those matters?
MS. BRINKMANN:

7
8

Yes --

Yes, Your Honor.

We don't

believe, however, that that adequately protects the public
interest, which the Director is vested and charged with

10

carrying out under the act.
QUESTION:

11

Well, do you think the other person

12

would have standing to appeal?

13

President, or the chairman of the Senate committee that

14

oversees these matters in the Congress?

15

have an interest in seeing how it's carried out, and have

16

standing to appeal, do you suppose?
MS. BRINKMANN:

17

For instant, the

Would they also

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

18

The Director's vested interests were imposed, or she was

charged with those through the act of Congress under

guess your position was sustained on standing with regard

25

to the effect on the special fund, and as to that, that's

not before us.

2

MS. BRINKMANN:

3

QUESTION:

It's not clear to me why the

4

Secretary is a person.

5

under the act?

6

No, Your Honor.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Why is the Secretary a person

Well, Your Honor, we believe

7

that the Secretary is an individual, and as -- in the

8

authority that we've cited in our brief, Government

9

officials can be considered persons depending on the

10

context of the statute.

11

the courts of appeals or the parties below raised as a

12

challenge, and it has never been viewed as such, that she

13

would be excluded from that.

14

QUESTION:

This was not a basis that any of

But the only reason she is suing is

15

in her official capacity, in which case she's really no

16

different from the agency, and the agency doesn't have --

17

the agency isn't defined as -- in the statute --

18

MS. BRINKMANN:

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, the --

-- as being a person.
-- the Director has particular

21

duties under the statute to further public purposes under

22

the act that the court of appeals didn't recognize.

23

court of appeals had much too narrower a view of the

24

Director's responsibilities under the act.

25

QUESTION:

The

But those responsibilities derived

1

from the prerogatives and the interests of the agency, and

2

it seems to me that the Secretary is in no different

3

position than the agency is.

4

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, the Secretary and

5

the delegate, the Director, is a Government official

6

acting on behalf of the agency, but she is not an official

7

that is permitted to overrule the board ruling, so in her

8

role as the policymaker under the act, she is vested with

9

the right and the ability to seek judicial review of board

10
11

rulings if she disagrees with them.
QUESTION:

But again, only by reason of her

12

official connection to the agency.

13

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor, but we don't

14

believe a person excludes that.

15

person in the structure of those definitions would also

16

exclude employer, and not permit an employer --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

No.

Under that rationale, a

No, because that includes

corporation.
MS. BRINKMANN:

But an employer is elsewhere

20

defined in that section, also.

21

fact there's a separate provision explaining that the

22

Secretary of Labor that is referred to when the term

23

"Secretary" is used doesn't undermine the fact that the

24

Secretary is included as a person.

25

QUESTION:

We just think that the

Well, it isn't that that undermines

1

it, it's the fact that the definition is strikingly

2

different from the definition in the Administrative

3

Procedure Act, which has a similar provision about who has

4

standing, and the language is almost the same, any person

5

adversely affected or aggrieved may obtain review, and

6

"person" is defined in the Administrative Procedure Act

7

similar to the definition here, except it goes on to

8

include public or private organization.

9

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

10

in order to assess the Director's standing, it's important

11

to focus on the structure of the Longshore & Harbor

12

Workers' Compensation Act and the history of it.

13

time that the board was created, these provisions was

14

created, it had been the longstanding recognition that the

15

Director did have standing to appeal from the district

16

court to the court of appeals.

17

At the

In 1972, when these provisions were added, all

18

that Congress did was replace the district court's role

19

with the board's role, and there's no indication in the

20

text or structure of the act that there was any intent to

21

change the fact that the Director had standing to seek

22

court of appeals review of that ruling.

23

QUESTION:

It's a strange -- your argument is

24

simply because the Secretary has policymaking concerns and

25

policymaking interests, the Secretary is a person

1

adversely affected.
Let's take a case in which an employer and

2

3

employee get involved in a contract dispute under State

4

law, and the employer wins on the ground that -- the

5

decisional ground is that the National Labor Relations Act

6

preempts the contractual question.

7

Labor Board, even though it was not a party to that

8

private contractual dispute, would have standing to

9

appeal?

Do you think that the

That's a -- it's an awfully broad interpretation

10

of when public officers have authority to go into court

11

and continue litigation in which they are not personally

12

at all involved.

3
4

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, if I may, I think I

have about three answers to that question.

5

QUESTION:

6

(Laughter.)

7

MS. BRINKMANN:

Okay.

Give me the best one first.

First of all, are our position

8

is on the interest that -- how Congress vested the

9

Director with standing is not limited to the fact that

20

she's a policymaking authority.

21

official that's charged with ensuring that the act is

22

lawfully administered.

23

She is the Government

Part of that interest is ensuring that claims

24

are correctly determined under the act, and that is so

25

because underlying this act are public purposes, both

through the nature of a Workers' -- Workmans' Compensation

2

Program through the structure of the act, and the fact

3

that employers and employees don't have incentives to

4

protect those.

5
6

7

QUESTION:

Well, why is that different from the

Labor Board?
MS. BRINKMANN:

In this case, Congress set up

8

this statute, set up the statutory scheme and designated

9

the Secretary as the person to play that role.

The public

10

purpose is including not just providing compensation to an

11

injured or maritime worker, but ensuring that that payment

12

comes from the industry fund so that the burden isn't

13

placed on other public disability benefits for private

14

charities, and also that payment serves as an incentive to

15

the employer.

16

QUESTION:

Do you rely to any extent in this

17

respect to her role as the person who proposes a

18

compensation award?

19

question about, is there something different from just any

20

agency that's interested in the sound enforcement of the

21

law, does she have an initiating role?

22

participate in this proceeding in a way that doesn't

23

happen in other agencies?

24
25

In answering Justice Scalia's

MS. BRINKMANN:

Does she

Yes, there are many provisions

throughout the statute that provide for the Director to

2

charged with responsibility under section 939 with

3

assisting claimant in the process and with assisting

4

claimants in obtaining services such as rehabilitation

5

services.

6

QUESTION:

In the proceeding, is what Justice

7

Ginsburg is asking about.

8

board, does she play a part?

9

MS. BRINKMANN:

In the proceeding before the

Yes, Your Honor.

I think we

10

have to step back all the way to the initiation of the

11

proceeding.

12

employers are obligated to make payment even without an

13

award being entered.

14

914(a), the employer has to pay even without an award.

15

In fact, under this statutory scheme,

If it's not controverted under

At that stage, under 914(h) the Director has the

16

authority to sua sponte initiate an investigation into

17

that payment even if it's not controverted and there's no

18

dispute about it.

20

with the --

QUESTION:

On her own, she has the initiative to

only if it's not controverted?
MS. BRINKMANN:

In either case.

controverted, she has no authority, does she?
MS. BRINKMANN:

2

Yes.

Under 919, then, if it's

3

controverted, the notice is filed with the Director and

4

she is charged with an informal resolution period which

5

she meets with the employer and the employee and attempts

6

to achieve a resolution, and --

QUESTION:

But not as an advocate, as an

8

impartial adjudicator, presumably.

MS. BRINKMANN:

11

The regulations make clear that

at that stage she is charged with informing that as to -with her expertise under the scheme about the rigid

2

Yes, Your Honor, and in fact in the

3

O'Keefe case, which was a case that ultimately came to

4

this Court through the Rasmussen case, the Director has

5

proceeded -- I wouldn't say necessarily on behalf of the

6

employer or on behalf of the employee at that point.

7

is pursuing the public's interest in ensuring that the

8

correct compensation is paid, so that employers don't have

9

to pay too much.

She

That also is inconsistent with the aims of this

10
11

Workers Compensation Program that was set up to ensure

12

that there were certainties and availability of awards for

13

injured workers at the same time eliminating other legal

14

rights of workers to sue.

QUESTION:

What if the employee chooses not to

not to litigate at all.

Again, going back to the

21

different phases, if there was an employer who was

22

obligated to make an award, and was making an award, and

the employee was satisfied with that but the employer

thought -- the director thought that it was not an --

investigations, no.
At that point, the claimant and the employer

2

3

usually come in and there's informal resolution, and that

4

may lead to a settlement, that may -- to an award that the

5

Director can then issue, or the claimant -QUESTION:

6

But it doesn't.

Let's assume it

7

doesn't.

The employer listens and says, Secretary, I

think you're wrong, I'm not going to pay any more than

this, and the employee, a very complaisant kind of a

person, says, that's okay with me.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, that's not a

14

situation that has arisen, and we're not aware of the

15

Director doing a claim -- initiating a claim on her own.

16

For the most part --

17

QUESTION:

But it seems to me strange that if

18

the employer does go, gets a judgment from the board and

19

says, it's good enough for me, she can take an appeal, but

20

she can't go into the board in the first place, if he

21

chooses not to go before the board.

22

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's very strange.

Your Honor, to the extent -- I

23

think most of the situations that you're referring to

would be characterized as settlements that would require

The act frankly is structured to prohibit

collusion between employers and employees, for example,

and this is why the employers and employees -QUESTION:

5

May I interrupt for a minute?

I'm

6

not sure I understand your answer to Justice Scalia's

question.

8

Could the Director initiate a proceeding in the situation

9

he posits, in your view?

10

MS. BRINKMANN:

You say they don't do it.

Could they do it?

I can think of a situation in

11

which that may be possible.

12

issue has not been litigated, and that frankly has not

13

arisen as a practical matter, but, for example --

QUESTION:

As I said, Your Honor, that

But I still am curious, you know,

15

what your construction of the statute is with regard to

16

the power of the director to do it if she wants to.

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

I think that, for example, in a

18

situation where an employee was preferring to obtain

19

disability insurance benefits under the Social Security

20

Administration Program, for example, in lieu of pursuing

21

that, the Director would have an interest in the lawful

22

administration of this act certainly by initiating an

informal investigation.

of initiative by the claimant to view that as a settlement

Practically, how would she even know

There are all kinds of

obligations on the employer and the employee --

QUESTION:

To report.

8

MS. BRINKMANN:

-- to notify -- yes.

Yes.

It's

a very rigid reporting scheme and compensation scheme, and
10

the Director is involved in that throughout, and -QUESTION:

11

Is there any scheme like this --

12

apart from the Black Lung Benefits Act, in all of Federal

13

claims, is there any other regime quite like this, with

14

this split, and -- well -MS. BRINKMANN:

15

Not that --we believe that

16

OSHRC and the Mine Safety Health Review Commission are the

17

most analogous situations, although we concede those are

different because their mission is wholly independent.

QUESTION:

And the Secretary appears all the

time.

Doesn't the agency there have prosecutory authority

MS. BRINKMANN:

Not enforcing.

I'm talking about

litigating, going in to initiate an action against the
employer.
MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, Workers'

Compensation schemes were set up to try and -QUESTION:

But am I not correct that these other

schemes that you're appealing to as being the same thing
are schemes in which the Secretary or the agency goes in
before the Commission as an aggressor, as a postulant, to
seek relief?

That's certainly one of the

roles that the Secretary -QUESTION:

Your Honor, we believe, however,

when we look at standing, when you look at the
responsibility that the Secretary has been charged with
under this act, for example, approving settlement,
fostering informal resolution, entering awards, in the
informal resolution process the Director does have
authority to enter award.
Also, if there's a request for modification for
an award, the Director has the authority to enter awards,
so there are certain situations in which the Director does

MS. BRINKMANN:

if I go back to the situation where the employee also has

an opportunity to receive compensation through the Social

That is the heart of the controversy, and that,

frankly, is one of the problems the Director has always

had.

12

Why did they change sides?

3

At least twice before this Court they changed sides.
Because they don't have

anything at stake.

4

They're sitting there with some kind of super

they're saying, well, maybe it should be this way, or

don't have the controversy, and therefore they don't have

the standing, and similarly, even in the briefs before

I think if you look at the -- our

main argument is, if you look at the '72 amendments, there

was no such thing as the agency appealing the decision,

MR. POSTOL:

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
So it's -It's the same agency.
Right.

But now, in answer to Justice

8

Scalia, you seem to be making a purely statutory argument

9

so that you'd have a dysjunction, if we accepted that

10

argument.

Congress appeared to have meant to have the

11

same regime govern both acts --

12

MR. POSTOL:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. POSTOL:

Yes.
-- is that not so?
That is correct.

But in the Black

15

Lung Act, they said the Director has standing, and I

16

think, as I pointed out in our brief, there's some logic

17

to that, because in the Black Lung cases oftentimes the

18

Director is protecting the Black Lung Fund.

19

QUESTION:

Am I right that we just --we got

20

into this only because the Fourth Circuit raised the

21

question on its own motion, and it did so because it

22

thought that there was an Article III infirmity?

23

MR. POSTOL:

Well, they raised it on their own.

24

They did not rule on the Article III.

25

the affected and aggrieved standard is, in fact, identical

what they said is,

1

to Article III, and we don't think that they are aggrieved

2

or affected, so the Fourth Circuit equated the statutory

3

definition with the Article III standard, and therefore

4

didn't differentiate.

5

QUESTION:

If I can -I assume that it's a question that

6

the Court would have to raise sua sponte, whether the lack

7

of standing is a constitutional lack or a statutory lack.

8

If you have a case before you in which someone does not

9

have statutory standing, I suppose that's a case over

10

which you have no jurisdiction, so the mere fact that the

11

court below raised it sua sponte doesn't mean that the

12

court below was necessarily relying on constitutional

13

grounds, isn't that right?

14

MR. POSTOL:

That is correct.

If they have no

15

subject matter jurisdiction, they have no subject matter

16

jurisdiction and they have to raise it.

17

May I go back to a point the Court raised

18

earlier with the Solicitor, and that is, to understand the

19

plaintiff's procedure, the fact is that the Director

20

cannot file a claim.

21

an employee must give notice of his injury, and within 1

22

year, under section 13, a claim, the injured party must

23

file a claim.

Under section 12 and 13 of the act,

24

The fact is, if the injured party does not file

25

a claim, the Department of Labor cannot do anything about

They are not some kind of super prosecutor.

don't want to file a claim, I was injured at work, but so

the claims proceeding.

I believe that they have to file a claim as well,

So that 1) the Director can't start the

Secondly, the

15

Solicitor relies heavily on the fact that there is this

16

administrative proceeding in which the Deputy

Commissioner, now called District Directors, tries to

18

bring the parties together, tries to get them to settle,

19

but look what Congress did with that.

20

that's fine and good, but we're separating the

administration from the adjudication, so when you go to

They then put an agency in, the Benefits Review

there did they suggest that there would be some other part

Nowhere in

And in fact, as Justice Scalia's question

So I think while the -- you could decide this on
