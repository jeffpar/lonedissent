As I stand 'here in this placee where many great man

minded of an incidence that occurred in the Supreme Court of

11

Georgia in my early years in the practice of law*

12

In. addressing that bodys I was arguing with all my

13

might the point of law and the late Chief Justice of that

14

court said to me» SfMr0 Wallacee we are not interested in

15

hearing your version of the law©

16

We would rather hear something about the facts.3’

Remember„ we make it here©

With that thought in mind„ and this being my first

Appeals® for review,, of Georgia©

10

I took that case to the Court of
It was reversed on an erroneous

charge of the late Judge Walton Usher©

11

In 19875, in October® this same man was called upon in

12

the same court® under the same indictment® for the same offense

13

of murder® to answer and to plea to the charge of murder©

14

to the case the second time® in 1967® I filed a plea in. the

15

coott

for double jeopardy©

Prior

The plea was argued at length and

t

18

the court overruled my plea of double jeopardy and the case

17

went to trial the second time® not for manslaughter but under

IS

the same indictment® a grand jury indictment® for the same

13

offense before a jury and before the same, trial judge©

20

That jury had brought in a verdict of guilty® and said

21

nothing about murder®, of voluntary manslaughter® as did the

22

first juryg fixing his sentence at ten years rather than 10 to

23

15 years® as the first jury did©

24
25

The usual procedure was followed and the case was
again appealed to the Court of Appeals of Georgia
3

the Supreme

1

Court of Georgia,;, I believee and they sent it to the Court of

2

Appeals and then it went back by certiorari to the Supreme

3

Court of Georgiaand we are now in this Court for an opinion»

4

There are two constitutional questions that we raise®

5

Q

Gould I ask you a question?

6

A

YeSj, sir©

7

Q

What grounds did the Supreme Court give for

8

overruling your motion for a plea in bar t whatever you choose

9

to call it?

10

A

y

1 believe& if Your Honor please„ the appendix

11

will show that no reason was given except: that the. motion was

12

denied9 if my memory serves me correctly®

13

Q

There was no opinion?

14

A

That is correct©

Q

15

*

Is your position,, Mr© Wallacee

,at the second

16

trial he could be charged and tried only under the charge of

17

voluntary manslaughter?

18

A

Yes@ sir©

19

Q

Nothing more?

20

A

Yas„ sir©

21

Q

Did you citeGreen vs© United States Supreme

22

23

Court?
A

I think the appendix will show that©

Not ©nly8

24

Mr© Chief Justice,, did I cite the Green caee„ but there was a

25

case out of the. Second Circuit Court of Appeals0 and I believe
4

1

Justice Marshall wrote that opinion.», when he was on that bench»

£

I may not pronounce that word correctly»

3

for pronouncing proper names9 but l believe it is Hetenyi* is

4

that right?

5

Q

Hetenyio

6

A

And in thatdecision

There is no set rule

thatJustice

Marshall

7

wrote* or that opinion* he used the Green case* and 1 used both

S

of these cases in my argument in the trial court»

9

Q

10

A

It

Q

Now

May 1 ask0 Mr 0 Wallace
Yes® sir?
<*•=> if you had been right* would it have been

12

necessary to have a hew indictment limited to a charge of

13

voluntary manslaughter?
A

14

Under Georgia

law* X believe

that is correct*

IS

and that was what I insisted® that a new indictment be brought»

16

Now <=>=>

Will the statute of limitations run on the new

indictment?

Well* were you sc much concerned about whether

23

he was reindicted or whether he was tried on any charge higher

24

that voluntary manslaughter?

25

A

Well* Mr» Chief Justice* X felt that to try him
5

1

again would he double jeopardy® trying him twice for something

2

that the first juror® the second time® that the first, jury

3

had acquitted him ofs

4

Q

What 1 was thinking of is® if as a practical

5

matter in the second trial® if the trial judge had ruled that

6

he would submot no charge to the jury higher than voluntary

7

manslaughter® would that have satisfied your situation?

3

A

9

Q

Gould he have done that under Georgia law?

10

A

Yes® he could have done that under Georgia law®

?!
12

Yes® sir„

Yes® sir»

yes® sir»
Now® when this jury <*’<*> and my position is the same as

13

the Green case and the case in which Justice Marshall rendered

U

his opinion .=>« when that first case jury carae in and said® if

15

my memory serves me correctly$ “Wee the jury® find the defend­

16

ant guilty of voluntary manslaughter® and fix his punishment

17

at from 10 to 15 years®*' it was the same® even though they

18

were silent on the murder charge»

19

jury had come in. and :saide 'We® the jury® find the defendant

20

not guilty of murder® but guilty of voluntary manslaughter „8T

21

It was the same as if the

Now® my humble opponent here may argue the point

22

that he got a lesser sentence at the second trial® even though

23

he was tried for murder® and the appendix will show that the

24

second trial® the jury was given the charge of murder»

25

could have selected either

They

they could have found him guilty

!

1

of either murder or voluntary manslaughter» as they saw fit»

a

But» as 1 started to say 9 my friend here on my right

3

will probably argue that this was a lesser sentence» 10 years

or with regard to 10 to 15 years»

5

admit that under the rule in Georgia our pardon and parol®

you are eligible for parole»

1 am sure that my friend will

12

June of last year in the Benton vs» Maryland case»

Q

What is the injury that your man suffered in

A

Well» Mr» Justice Black» 1 feel that the injury

this case?

23

was «*=> you got me a little ahead of my thought» I was going to

24

bring that out» but if you will give me just a second

25

You go right ahead»

1

A

I feel that the Injury Is that if the jury had

z

been given the opportunity to decide the question of whether

3

or not he was guilty of voluntary manslaughter ? rather than

4

murder * they would have given

5

as it was said in the case of Justice Marshall, that he wrote

6

the opinion on, in the Green case,, but I feel that they would

7

have considered his innocence, probably given more thought or

8

more consideration to his innocence rather than to considering

9

his conviction, if he had been fried for manslaughter& because

10

and 1 may not be stating that

he was tried the second time for murder„

11

Does that answer your question as to ray position, sir?

It probably answers it about as well as can be

time for voluntary manslaughterp under Georgia law what other

19

offenses are lesser included offenses under that charge?

have

possibly & sentence of one year maximum, $1,000 fine, plus

23

six months in jailo

ARGUMENT OF MMMEW ROBINS „ ESQo

4

OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

I

5

S

MRo ROBINS;

Mr» Chief Justiceg and may it please the

Court:

7

I rise now to respond to one of the two directives of

8

this Court wherein this Court asks to show why Benton va0

9

Maryland may or may not be applicable to the facts of this

10

case8 and I respond to that firstly»
I would say9 as reluctantly as I can* that Benton vs0

11
12

Maryland is applicable to this esse but not so much because of

13

what Benton vs0 Maryland says but because it made Green, applic®

14

able to this case., and the implied acquittal doctrine which was

15

the federal principle prior to Benton vs» Maryland»

16

believe that I can escape the implied acquittal doctrine of

17

Green»

.

I don1
8t* * * * * *

1

i

18

1 am particularly persuaded to this decision by the
;

19

fact that the Chief Justice,, in his dissent in Ash vs»

j

20

Swenson^ emphasized the fact that the phrase ’’run the gauntlet

|

21

in Green meant as to that charge0}'

22

case that is perhaps what has happened to Mr» Price*, he has

23

run the gauntlet on the murder charge»

24
25

Q

I am afraid that in this

How would you respond to argue that while under

the law of the District of Columbia there might be a prior
10

1

acquittal for first degree murder unde? these circumstances of

2

a general jury verdict of manslaughter «<=> still the law of

3

your jurisdiction is different., and a jury verdict of man®

4

slaughter9 after a trial and indictment for murdert Is not*

5

under the law of your jurisdiction* an acquittal of first de~

6

gree murder0

7

A

Yes 8 1 am suggesting that because in the. State

S

of Georgias of course9 they do not come back and say that he

9

is acquitted of murder and he is found guilty of voluntary

10

manslaughter„ as for the facts in this case,

11

of Georgiag they can return a verdict for manslaughter and it

12

may be because

13

because the crime does not warrant the punishment which murder

14

would require^, that is death or life imprisonment* that is

15

required by statute0

16

the jury are such that they may feel that this doesn®t warrant

17

that kind of punishments, and yet there is sufficient evidence

18

that would warrant a ^voluntary manslaughter conviction.,

19

But in the State

and? this is just conjecture <*•«=> it rosy be

It may be that the facts as presented to

I might also that in the State of Georgia a jury may

Q

16

Under Georgia law does the jury fix the penalty

In the murder situation^ they indirectly fix the

the punishment^ I believe*. within the prescribed range®
12

i

1 cannot state with ali certainty whether the judge

2

is obligated to follow that recommendation of the jury*,

3

this particular case, the punishment for voluntary manslaughter

4

is one to twenty,,

5

and subsequently at: 10„

In

They fixed punishment at 10 to 15 initially@

This brings to mind a very important point, and I

6
o=3

i

want to emphasise this:

8

set out to the Court, that I would urge this Court to find

9

that this man has not been harmed0

It is my contention, as my brother

1 recognise the harmful

10

error is a proposition that states perhaps overemphasize, the

11

fact that there is not harmful error0

12

not harmful error„

13

15 and, under the old law of Georgia, that would have meant

!4

that he would have been eligible for a conditional release,

15

which is tantamount; to a parole9 at the end of ten years 0

16

I say here there was

This man was initially sentences to 10 to

In 1964, the Georgia General Assembly changed the.

17

law and required that sentences be made definite, and subset

18

quently at his second trial, Mre Price was sentenced to ten

19

years„

20

years and nine months, assuming that all good behavior «=*-■ time,

21

off for good behavioro

22

by the act of the General Assembly but, more importantly, he

23

has not been harmed in what has happened, I would submit„

24

If the Court is going to consider that a tenure

25

This meant that he could get out at the end of five

So he has received a material benefit

propositionj then it is considering that perhaps the jury could
13

1

not or would not do Its duty, that it would not follow the die­

2

rectioris of the Courte

3

rejected the charge of the court as to murder and brought back

4

the lesser charge,,

5

In this particular situation, the jury

I would submit to this Court that the record clearly

6

shows that they did do their duty8 and it would only be con­

7

jecture that they might have done something else had there not

8

been evidence on murder„

9

Q

As 1 understand it, General Robins9 you're

10

conceding, in this aspect of your argument, you’re conceding

II

at least for the purposes of argument that the trial judge

12

should have granted the motion and should have allowed the

13

state to try him only for manslaughter?

14

A

Would at trialtoday,yes, sir0

IS

Q

You're conceding

16

A

Yes, I am»

17

Q

And vou6ra saying that since9 as it came down,

thatfor purposes of argument?

13

he was convicted of no more than manslaughter and indeed given

19

a lower sentence than he received at the first trials

20

completely harmless «=<=*

21

A

22

Q

23

It was

Yes, sir
«« obviously, and there would be no cons tit ac­

tional error?

24

A

Yes, siro

25

Q

Is that your point?

14

1

A

Yes„ sir, that is my point insofar as the

2

applicability of the Benton and the Green rule made, that

Righto

I am persuaded

And that this is a case quite unlike Green be«

cause in Green he v/as tried again and that time convicted of

8

first degree murder and sentences to death?

9

A

Yes9 sir5 I

10

Q

And that thistherefore

11

case? is that right?

12

A

isquite a different

Yes9 there is quite a bit of differencco

In

13

fact», this case actually is different from any other case that

14

I can find in the records of this Courts with the possible

W

exception of Ghicos vs® Indiana, where factually there was a

IS

similar situations, and this Court chose not to pass upon it®

17

However,; in the Ghicos case, in what I understood to be just

18

dieturns it did say that the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy

19

proposition was not; applicable to the states»

20

But factually this case is different, and because of

21

the facts it takes it out from Beaton, takes it out from Green,

22

and makes it a new case®

23

Green is completely applicables because there that man came

24

back with a death sentence the second time»

25

man has come back with something even less than he got the

I don't believe that we can say that

15

This case, this

!

first time insofar as time to be served in prison0

2

g

Has he been given full credit in serving of his

3

second sentence for the time he served as a result of the first

4

conviction?

3

A

No, Your Honor 9

S

Q

None at all?

7

A

None at all,

8

Q

Has he yet?

9

A

He is serving now, I believe, Mr0 Justice White,

he did not serve any time?

to my understandingo

10

But he did not serve any time after the first sentence,,

11

ever, Georgia law does provide that where one remains incarcer®

12

ated in jail during an appeals they will receive benefit for

13

that time»

14

carceratedc

15

Q

How*»

So he would have received benefit had he been in**

Now, General Robins„ the language of the Con­

IS

stitution of prohibition is against being placed in jeopardy

17

for the same offensec

18

time, if the rationale of the Green case carries over and ap­

19

plies here, the implied acquittal9 was he not then placed in

20

jeopardy of conviction of murder, even though in fact the jury

21

returned the lesser verdict?

Now, when they tried him the second

4

22

A

Yes, sir, I believe I would have to admit that

23

to the Court,,

24

some distinguishing characteristic, but I cannot find a dis­

25

tinguishing characteristic,,

I have studied the cases0

I have strained for

And, as 1 stated earlier, I am
16

!

also persuaded that conclusion by Your Honor1s dissent in Ash

2

vs* Swenson,} which makes reference to running the gauntlet on

3

that charge, and if we apply that rationale to this case, Mr*

4

Price ran the gauntlet on the charge of murder , though he was

5

convicted of a lesser crime»

6

Also I must recognize that in ULS* vs* Balls this

7

Court said that the double jeopardy provision is not determined

8

upon the punishment that he receives, that by the fact whether

9

he has in fact been tried for that crime*

10

11

So it is difficult

for me at all to escape this*
But notwithstanding this, and even admitting, if

12

this would not perhaps be a proper case to decide the retro»*

9

activity of Benton* but nevertheless this Court has for some

10

time now9 especially /Since 1965,. in the case of Linkletfer vs»

11

Walker8 set out certain criteria which it has tried to follow

12

in determining whether a case should be retroactive»

.

He can be reindicted©

No3 sir, I can't see that©

We shouldn't do that, should we?

No©

Even if you win?

A

I think

it should beremanded back

to

the state

8

courtse with anything to be handled,. If this Gourt should find

9

that he has been subjected to double jeopardy, but not incon­

10

sistent with that decision©

Now, that is my position©

11

Now, that is where I say the harm has been done©

12

Q

Would it be appropriate,,,

inyourjudgment

—

13

I want you to consider this question before you answer it,

14

because perhaps you wouldn't want to answer it today

15

it be appropriate to, if the Court found for you, on the

16

basic issue of double jeopardy, to remand the case giving

17

Georgia the alternative of reindicting him, if their law

18

permits, or trying him under the existing indictment but with

19

a limitation that no charge higher than voluntary manslaughter

20

could be submitted?

21

A

would

If I may go outside the record, if Your.’ Honor

22

please, that issue came up in the argument in the court when I

23

argued the plea of double jeopardy, that the Solicitor said

24

that he is indicted for murder and that is all I can try him

25

for©

Now, he said I would have to go back and get a new

35

1

indictment for manslaughter in order to do it, and that is

2

when t he judge picked up his gavel and said, '’Motion over**

3

ruled <,*’
Now, l still contend that he can be retried for taan«

16

Now,

understand it.
A

They can come in with a recommendation.

If it

22

is without recommendation, then the court has no other alter­

native but to inflict the death sentence,

5

A

Ncmv to the question of retroactivity8 my good

6

friend here has called the Court's attention to the Barthus

7

cases and I have set this out in my brief and 1 feel that this

8

honorable body has read that brief»

9

The feet have been cut out from under that case® not only that

That was a 1910 decision»

10

case but other cases have been set aside»

II

is gone»

12
13
14

The Polko doctrine

The Twining doctrine case is gone»

The Brock case

all of those decisions of this honorable body have teen
cut away0
We are living in the year 1970 and not 1910«

There

15

have been many decisions recently in this Court that have

16

been overturned9 at least® old established rules and prin­

17

ciples that have long since been gone»

18

with my brother on this Benton case® which said if a man

19

voluntarily seeks a new trial and attains it® then he is

20

barred from pleading double jeopardy»

21

And I cannot go along

That is not so now»

How® if the Benton case means anything® it means

22

that it would be unfair® certainly discriminatory® to give new

23

trials for unconstitutional convictions® when others are kept

24

in prison without any hope or any reward whatsoever» simply

23

because it would cost the state maybe a little money or a
38

1

little effort9 to retry an individual„

2

Life at its best is short and sweet»

I don -1 care

3

if it is man or beast»

4

not give him the privilege of what you have given someone

5

else would certainly be. 9 in my opinion», unjust and certainly

0

a rape of justice f if 1 may use that phrase»

And to incarcerate a man in jail and

Nows as I said in raj; brief , I am not too concerned

7
8

about that»

9

have violated the law»

I think the Benton case said to Maryland9 "You
You have gone beyond your bounds in

10

convicting this man*, of placing him in jeopardy twice»

n

correct it»**

12

-

Nowe

If the Green case* and the. case from the Second

13

Circuit Court of Appeals means anything at all,, it means that

14

all of the states,

15

given a man his constitutional rights„ or

16

that right9 then 3: think the Benton case says retry, regard^

17

less of what the consequences are„ and that is the way I feel

13

about ito

if you have violated a law and you haven®t
he has been denied

19

Now@ I would like to «■-

he has suffered in being tried on

Mr» Justice Black* I feel that had he not been

39

1

tried for murder the second time, as it was I believe you who

2

wrote a dissenting opinion in the Gichos case, and this is

3

your language, sir;

4

for murder” ®« now, Mrc Justice Marshall adopted that as his

5

decision

6

it gave the prosecution, the state, an unfair advantage of

7

!,By trying petitioner the second time

nBy frying petitioner the second time for murder,

offering the jury a choice, a situation that was apt to in«

S

duce a doubtful jury to find petitioner guilty of a lesser

9

offense rather than find him not guilty or acquittal or even

10

continue their deliberations or debate as to his innocence„”

11

.

Now, my position is, if this man had not been tried

12

for murder, I feel that this jury, this is a small county,

13

with a population of about 15,000 »»

14

Q

What county is it?

15

Effingham countys Springfield, Georgiau

Q

Where is it, below Savannah?

18

A

It is about thirty miles out of Savannah, on

W

Highway 21«,

20

slaughter, the jury would have been more inclined and probably

2!

considered longer his innocence rather than to find him guilty

22

of some lesser offense than murder, when he was tried for

23

murder the second timeo

Florida case»

IS

this year that these two decisions came down„ this is not last

20

year or five years ago or back in 19109 and this was very

21

plain <*•■« there can. be no doubt of the retroactivity of the

22

court's decision in Benton vsu Maryland — that is a headnote

23

in North Carolina vs» Pearce9 395 U0S0 71L„ decided the

And the court said, and that was on April of

was Justice Brennan® I believe «■» I am not supposed to refer

9

specifically to Justices, but I hope Justice Brennan will

10

pardon me »- I add to the Court's ruling in Ash vs„ Swanson,

that cur decision in Benton vs» Maryland® holding the double

state "fully retroactive,"

I think that is the crux of ray

16

I think the Benton case is retroactive®in any case

17

it might fall within its bounds and within the ambit of that

18

case, and I say that this Price case is one of those cases„

19

And I am asking this Court, in all fairness, to give this man

20

the opportunity and® as I said, I doubt »*• and I have very

21

serious doubts »» that this man will ever be tried again»

22

think this will wind it up, because, as I said® I can't

out anything outside the record»
