ORAL ARGUMENT (Continued) BY DENNIS G. LYONS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. LYONS:

8

10

Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Yesterday afternoon we were to the point where we were

discussing what we take to be the principal contention of the

H

Respondents here, and that is that the April 26, 1967 order of

12

the Federal District Court, and that wns ‘the order that

13

denied the Atlantic Coast Line a preliminary injunction.

14

That order was being protected or effectuated by the

15

subsequent injunction, the 1969 injunction against enforcement

10

of the May *67 order of the State Court and on that basis they

17

contend there is an exception here from Section 2283.

18

Our basic answer to that proposition is that the

19

Federal District Court never purported to pass upon the

20

availability of state rights or state remedies to the Atlantic

21

22

23
24
25

Coast Line.

His decree amounted to the denial of an injunction

which is sought solely under Federal Law.
Their argument, whichwas made for the first time, two
years later that the State injunction of May 1967 contravenes
the Federal denial of an injunction is, we submit, simply a
24

1

setting up of a Federal Law defense based onthis Court's

2

subsequent decision in Jacksonville Terminal against the in­

3

junction in the State Court proceedings.
Now, there are a number of subsidiary reasons why that

4
5

April 26, 1967 order could not be the basis of a claimed

6

exception here from Section 2283»

7

read the order, there is some.dispute about it, but most of the

8

cases that it cited are Norris-LaGuardia cases and it appears

9

to us to proceed primarily on the basis of the Norris-LaGuardia

10

In the first place, as we

Act.
We contend that the Federal Court order simply de­

n
12

fines an injunction by reason of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and

13

of course, the legislative history of that Act is — leaves

n

open the remedies under State lav? and inthe State Courts.
The Respondents contend that the Federal Court ©seder

15
16

17

somehow constituted, a comprehensive declaration of a party's
rights„ and, in effect, I suppose, held thalthe Coast Line,

18

the neutral road had no right to injunctive relief here on any

13

basis o

20
21

22
23
24
25

On its face, the order simply doesn't say that.

The

most you could say if the order were a declaration of rights
and we don't read it that way at all? we read it as simply a
denial on the basis of the Morris-LaGuardia Act,
were rights under Federal Law.

All it denied

There is the further point that

it's simply an order made upon applications for, at the most,
25

'I

a preliminary injunction? indeed* it might have been an order

a

simply denying a temporary restraining order.

3

little unclear, but giving the Respondents the benefit of the

4

doubt, it*s an order denying a preliminary injunction.

3

the laws, we submit, quite block letter, on the point that you

6

cannot have a termination of the party’s substantive rights

7

through a proceeding on a preliminary injunction application.

8
0

The record is a

And

We submit that really, what the Respondents are try­
ing to do here is to adjudicate this Federal Law defense?

10

call it preemption or supercession, or maybe, perhaps, simply

11

call it the assertion of a Federal Law of defense, to the State

12

Court injunction by an enjoining proceedings in the State

13

Court, and this, we submit, is at the core of what Section 2283

14

says that the Federal Courts are not to do,

15

Q

For what reason, Mr. Lyons, did the District

16

Court give for denying your application for leave to discon­

17

tinue the action?

18

A

He said that since the respondents had filed the

19

handwritten answer, which they did very shortly before the

20

notice of dismissal, that it was not dismissable as a right and

21

he then declined to grant the injunction — the order for a

22

voluntary dismissal upon motion.

23
24
25

And he said thatsince the Court was of the opinion
that the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction? that
is their counter-motions seeking to enjoin the State Court
26

1

proceedings has merit, our motion for voluntary dismissal will

2

be denied»

3

Q

What page is that?

4

A

That's on page IS5 of the appendix, Your Honor.

3

'In effect, he!s assigning the reason that h^wants to pass an

6

injunction against the plaintiff as a reason for denying the

7

plaintiff's motion to dismiss.
Q

8

Well, was it the railroad*« application for an

injunction that was denied?

9
10

A

'Back in 1967; yes, sir.

11

Q

And was the case dismissed?

12

A

No* it was'not; the case simply lay dormant for

two years.

13

'
Q

14

'

.•:

And that is the case in which this current order

has been entered?

15

A

16

That is correct, Your Honor; that is the case we

now have before this Court.

17

If the contentions that we make as to the applica­

■18
19

bility of Section 2283 are not well-founded, the Court must

20

still reach the question of whether the defense that the

21

Respondents have urged to the State Court injunction is a good

22

defense.
Now, of course, if the Court is in agreement with us

23

that Section 2283 is applicable here and that none of the ex­

24

ceptions is applicable, then the Court need not reach this point..

25

21
i

Q

1

Then, I suppose what happens is the right to

2

the union to review the State Court injunction is still avail­

3

able? is it not?
A

4

/

Because there is no final judgment has been

5

6

Yes»

entered.

7

A

8

If I might amplify a little bit on my answer to the

9
10

That's correcte

Chief Justice yesterday»

One of the basic reasons why we did

not proceed tohave a final judgment entered ourselves right

11

away, was that Judge McRae8s. order out of the Federal District

12

Court enjoined us from proceeding further with the State Court

13

proceedings » ‘ That injunction followed* on ttieuiieels, fairly

14

closely of the statement by the state judge that he would foe

15

willing to enter a final order»

18
17

IS

Q

Do you think that was broad enough to preclude

the State Court implementing its own decision by a judgment?
A

Well, he restrained us, Your Honor, from taking

19

any further action infurtherance of the rights thatwe had in the

20

State Court.

21

Q

By the Court, too? or just you?

22

A

Just us, but the State Court judge indicated he

23
24
25

wanted the parties to prepare a decree and at that point we
were under the Federal Court injunction and we were shortly
thereafter.

28

1

Q

2

A

3

I see.
But* our position is plain.

The Respondents are

entitled to a final judgment that they can appeal to —

4

Q

Do you think that that’s very clear* Mr» Lyons?

3

A

Yes? that is completely clear* Your Honor»

6

Q

7

A

8

And you concede it?
Yes? we concede that they are.entitled to have a

final judgment»

9

Q

And are they satisfied they do?

10

A

I believe they are* but 1 can't speak for them»

11

We submit that the Jacksonville Terminal case* which

12

is the Respondent's principal* perhaps sole authority* for the

13

proposition that they have a Federal Law defense* is not

14

applicable to the situation involved here at the Mon.cri.ef Yard*

15

which is a yard wholly owned by the' Atlantic Coast Line* a non-

16

struck carrier,

17

Wow* we don't intend to take the liberty of parsing

18

for the Court its opinion rendered only one year ago* but we

19

do call the Court's attention to the fact that there was a very4

20

very extensive discussion of the very peculiar facts involved

21

in the Jacksonville Terminal case.in that opinion.

22

The fact -that there we have a joint terminal facility*

23

jointly-owned and jointly-controlled by the carriers* including

24

the struck carriers and the struck, carrier had a right of veto

25

over the major decisions thatmight be undertaken with respect

23

1

to those premises»
Q

2

If we agree with your basic .argument with

3

respect to Section 2283, we dont8 get at ail to the question of

4

whether or not there is any difference between this case and

5

Jacksonville, do we?

6

A

You do not have to reach this ~

1

Q

At all if we agree with you on your primary —

S

A

That is correct, Your Honor,

9

Q

Contention„

10

A

I shall not belabor the point, but the opinion

II

in Jacksonville Terminal, abbreviated, at least, sterns to us

12

to turn on these unique factors at the jointly-owned facility.

13

This is a facility where FEC employees report, for work every

14

day on foot, which was generally controlled by them., which was,

15

in effect, the FEC passenger terminal at the northern end,

?6
17

which sold tickets for the FEC, which prepared FEC cards, which
performed extensive switching and routing services for them.
The Court discussed at some length the analogy with

IS
19

20
2!

22
23
24
25

the common situs cases under the Taft-Hartley Act and, in
effect, as we read the opinion, the Court included that in that
context.

The rather tangled and involved context of a joint

facility, that the Court did not believe that it could make a
judgment as to what extent the parties'self-help rights were
properly exercisable and to what extent they were not.
The Court took the view that, we submit, in that area

30

']

at least, that that essentially had to be a legislative judg­

2

ment*

3

Now, here we have gone beyond the exercise of self-

4

help rights against the primary parties to the dispute*

S

have gone beyond the. situation where the primary party, the FEC

6

is involved in the joint use and control of a terminal

7

facility*

8

What we have here is, essentially,

We

8!hot car picketing

9

At first it didn’t start out that way, and there are still in

10

this Court, protestations that that is not what was going on*

11

But, particularly in the last few days of the picketing here,

12

what you had was an attempt and a successful attempt to induce

13

the employees of the Coast Line operating within the Coast

14

Line’s own yard not to handle cars which had originated on the

15

FEC, and not to handle inbound cars coming down from the north

IQ

that were ultimately destined to the FEC*

17

Now, there is some thought by the Respondents that

18

this was done in a limited way, that they only refused to

19

handle long, solid blocks of cars; that they only refused to

20

make the very next move down to the point where the inter­

21

change would take place*

22

But the record is plain, particularly in the last few

23

days of the picketing that the refusals by 'the employees went

24

well beyond that, that they we re beyond simply involving this

25

last move down or back from the interchange point, that in one

31

15

1

case they declined to move a road train that, was destined up to

2

go to Way cross, Georgia,, which was Silly made up, simply because

3

it had FSC cars in it»

4

And inthe Court below, namely, before the State Court,

5

I should say, the counsel for the Respondents took the view tha:

0

this Court's opinion in Jacksonville Terminal was to the effect

7

that there was no longer any question of how far you can go or

3

how far you can't go, that there wasno longer any body of law

9

available to any employer doing business with the SPEC* that,
would in any way restrict their rights to picket his business»

10

How, we contend that if you read the Jacksonville

U
12

Terminal case that way, what you have is picketing that, I think

13

anybody would consider secondary picketing»

What the position of the Respondents is, as 1 under-

22

23

stand it, is that despite that, because of the fact that-the

24

T a ft-H artley Act is not as we concede, not applicable here in

25

the railroad industry, that there is no agency of government

32
i

1

state or Federal» judicial or administrative» that can any way

2

regulate or any way deal with these practices» regardless of

3

how far removed they are from directly operating upon the

party that they have the dispute with»

8

Landrum-Griffin Act» but not in the railroad area and what's

9

more» say the Respondents» the States can't do anything about

10

it, either.

11

Q

Do what extent did the District Judge rely» if

12

at all, on the business relationships between the Florida East

13

Coast and the Atlantic Coast Lina?

14

A

it's — I assume he had those before him, because

15

16

before.

17

Moncrief Yard was an integral and necessary part of the PEC's?

operations, which is clear.

19

down from the north or if they can’t, if there is a blockage in

20

the way in which their cars go up to the north, they simply can™

21

not operate.

22
23

And he did refer to certain findings that the use of the

Q

If they can't receive cars coming

But that reasoning would apply equally if this

facility had been owned by a completely independent entity with

24

the Florida East Coast and Atlantic Coast Line leasing the

25

facilities, apparently, wouldn't it?
33

A

1

Well, I suppose that would be the case, Your

2

Honor, but of course, here we do have an independent owner;

3

we do have the ACL which is completely independent of the PEC.
Q

4

Yes, but I mean independent of each of them? if

5

there had been a complete independence the result would have

6

been the same.
A

7

Yes, or indeed, I would think you would have the

8

same results had they gone up to Waycross, Georgia, or whatever

9

the next junction point or the next point where they could have

10

conveniently blockaded the trains. 'Getting through these othez?

11

points, going up to the north, are similarly integral and

12

essential to the FEC6s business, unless it can have some way

13

of getting its cars through to the points that it is supposed

14

to get them beyond its own line, it isn't going to continue to

15

operate.

16

Your Honors, we —

17

Q

Mr. Lyons, you would be making somewhat the same

18

argument if this case wasn't a railroad labor case, but was

19

under a NLRB or NLRA regime; wouldn't you?

20
21

22

A

I wouldn't ~~ we wouldn't have gone to the State

Courts, foot we would have made a- similar- -argument-Q

Let's assume a State Court purports to enjoin a

23

union from doing something that is either arguably or actually

24

protected or prohibited by the Labor Act, and that the National

25

Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with
34

j

1

it? but the State Court nevertheless,, purports to deal with it

2

by an injunction»

.

3

A

Yes

4

Q

And 1 suppose you would be making the same

5

argument that the employer or the union may not resort to

6

Federal Court for an injunction to prohibit the State Court

7

from doing it?
A

3
9

argument.

certainly would»
don61 really see how

wouldraake the Section 2283
could make an argument on

10

the merits in support of the State? because that5s a very clear

11

error.

12

Q

But the fact that the State Court had no juris­

13

diction or it would be said to have no jurisdictionj it

14

wouldn51 make any difference to your case?

15

A

16

We submit, lastly, that if the Jacksonville Terminal

23
24
25

Hot at all, Your Honor.

decision means what the Respondents say that it means, it
should be reconsidered by this Court, although certainly we
think the Court need not reach that point at all.
Our final contention takes us into an area which is
relatively uncharted by this Court's decisions and thafcis that
the Norris-LaGuardia ACt here, as well as Section 2283, pre­
cludes the injunction that the Federal Court granted.
The relationship between the nonstruck carriers and
the rail unions has been held by the lower court and this Court
35

V

1b a 4-»4 decision, ones upheld that as being a relationship

z

arising out of a labor dispute, and hence, in the Jacksonville

&■

Terminal case by this Court and in this case, the Moncrief

4

ease, by the lower court, the nonstruck carriers have been held

5

not to be entitled to have a Federal Court injunction.

‘

We say that the Norris-LaGuardia Act works both

6
7

ways.

If the Federal Courts may not pass an injunction against’;'

8

the unions, we submit that in this situation they may not pass

9

an injunction against the nonstruck carriers restraining them
from the use of the State Courts,

10

11

It is clear on the face of the Norris-LaGuardia Act

12

that it does work both ways? that it does inhibit injunctions

IS

against management, just as it inhibits injunctions against

14

unions and, in fact, we quote in our brief, considerable

15

dialogue on the Floor of the Senate and the House, which indi­

16

cates that Congress recognized that this was a two-way sword
when it was passed in 1932,

n

Indeed, some of the practices that can't be enjoined

1.8
19

are practices -that only an employer could commits, i.e,, join­

20

ing an employer organization, so we submit that the very broad

21

contention that the Respondents make that the Act doesnsfc apply

22

at all to injunctions against management is not correct.

p

We also say that Section 4-D of the statute makes it

23

plain that injunctions against the ordinary courts of judicial

24

proceedings, were one of the evils that Congress’, was trying to

25

36

I

1

r

1

deal with when it passed the statute.
That hain’g so, we are confronted with the very-

2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

11
12

13
14

flat prohibition ±i Section 7 which flatly restrains the courts
of the United States from granting any injunction in a labor
dispute t*

'

'•

; '
and those findings
*
were not made here, including findings which certainly were
very relevant to the subject matter heres namely: there is no
finding that complainant has no adequate remedy at law.
Certainly his appellate rights in the Florida State Courts
would heave precluded the making of that finding.
Indeed, there was no attempt to comply with the
Norris-LaGuardia Act at all.
So, for this reason as well, we contend that the
injunction here should not have been granted against the State
Court proceedings and that the judgment of the Court of

15
16

17
18

19
20
21

22

Appeals shou3.d be reversed,
Q

IThat®s the status of things now,

There is no

picketing going on now in this yard?
A

Mo; there is not; we do have a stay of the

Federal Court order ~™
Q

That’s the stay that Justice Black issued?

A

Yes, Your Honor,

With the Court’s permission I'll reserve the rest of
23
my time for rebuttal,

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ALLAN MILLEDGE, ESQ.

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4

MR. MILLEDGEs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

5

the Court;

We will demonstrate in our argument that this case,

6

this injunction issued by Judge McRae against the inconsistent

7

State Court actions is not an isolated case, but it arises out

8

of a totality of regulation of the Florida.East Coast dispute,

9

that goes back., to 1964 and involves every aspect of this

10

strike, including-regulation of good-faith bargaining, regula­

ii

tion of the self-help rights of a railroad, regulation of the

12

self-help rights of the union, the actual operations of the

13

railroad itself and that all of these are interrelated and all

14

bear upon each other.

15

Q

16

You mean you have some problems with the State

Court enjoining violent picketing?

17

A

Well, not violent picketing —

18

Q

Well, then the Federal Court didnBt take over

19

the entire controversy —

20

A

With that exception.

21

G

Well, why not the exception for secondary

22

activities?

23

A.

Because this Court has held in the Jacksonville

24

Terminal Company case that that is not only preempted, that is

25

State Law may not apply in that field -38

Q
either.

Well, it9s not preempted the Federal Court,

What can the Federal Court do about it?
A

Well, it is, as we interpret the opinion, it is

protected conduct toengage in whatever reasonable conduct that
the organisation ■—
Q

Well, what jurisdiction does the Federal Court

have over it?
A

Well, the railway --

Q

The Federal Court is preempted, too; isn't it?

A

In the opinion, there is the area, of course, of

damages which would be an area that the Federal Court could
deal with, but in the opinion of the Court of the last term
is, as we read it, that there is no limitation upon the self™
help rights so long as they are reasonable and that is a matter
that has been before the District Courts a number of times.
And I think I can develop,’ also, the interrelation­
ship.
The second thing that we will demonstrate is that
the power of the District Court to enjoin the State Court
action here under 2283 and this Court's opinions, is beyond
question that it has that power,
Q

Do you agree with Mr. Lyons that Morris-LaGuardi

is a two-way street?
A

Well ~

Q

only one provision in the Norris-LaGuardia Act that applies to

management, and that is the one he cited about employer or­

that the tail will go with the hide? that once the 2283 problem

8

is dealt with the Norris-LaGuardia Act problem — the Norris-

7

LaGuardia Act is just basically not designed for this type of a

problem,, and we will develop 'chat later, but our position is

not that the Norris-LaGuardia cannot apply to an employer.

of the District Court to do this.

case for the application of an injunction against the State

15

that has ever come before this Court or a lower court in a

Federal Courts, there are four separate cases, that is with
separate file numbers, that the jurisdiction of which is aided

by this injunction and orders need the protection of this in­
junction.
Now, the types of matters which have been before the
Courts below are absolutely legion.

This Court recalls the

Clerks® case that was before this Court.
40

That was a case

1

brought by the United States Government; it is a case in which

2

it was determined that the Florida East Coast Railroad for the

3

first two years of its operation, it's post-strike operation

4

was operating in violation of the Railway Labor Act»

5

was an order entered in that case requiring good-faith bargain­

6

ing»

certain limited exceptions or deviations from its collective

8

bargaining contracts in aid of its self help rights»

There was an order in that case granting to the railroad

That case still pends? there is a trial commencing or

9
10

another final hearing in that case commencing the first week

11

of April to go on for all of April and all of May-, and the

12

issues are, again, the good-faith bargaining — that8s on

13

contempt citations — the good-faith bargaining, massive

14

violations of the injunction since ‘the strike and on other

IS

issues B

16
17
18

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

All of that still pends and the good-faith order
depends on economic sanction»

As Mr. Justice Brennan has

written in the Insurance Agent8s case and has written in other
cases, too, and it’s in the CM,Iveston Wharves case, the
ieclsionof the Fifth Circuit in this same area of 2283.
But, bargaining, the motive power in bargaining is
economic sanction,,

Now, in this

that is the Florida

East Coast Strike, there are, as there are in all railroad or
other situations, two type of economic sanction.

One is the

withdrawal of your people at the commencement of the strike,
41

1

and the second type is picketing aimed at those persons, the

2

employees of persons malting pickups and deliveries to the

3

struck employer.
In other industries it’s more general than that, but

4
5

in the railroad industry the place where you put the pressure

6

on is where the railroad gets its freights, from another rail­

7

road.
Now* from the commencement of this strike up until

8
9

the present, there has not, with the exception of a few hours

10

in 566 and a few hours in 1967, been any use of the economic

1-1

sanction to stop pickup and deliveries from other railroads by

12

asking the employees of other railroads not to do so.
That has been prevented by an injunction initially

13
14

issued by the United States District Court for the Middle

15

District of Florida.

16

that case still pends»

17

talked about" that case.

And that is another case in which —
Mow, Mr» Lyons, .in his brief,

has

That's a case in which the United

18

States District Court has assumed, jurisdictionover inter-

19

changes„ and the organisations, the labor organisations were

20
21

never allowed to get into that case.
mandates interchange.

Mow, what has happened since that time is there was

22
23
24
25

And, as they say, it

a lawsuit filed in 1965 by the organization to construe that
injunction as not to apply to employees of the connecting
carrier.
42

Then, in 1966, the trainmen strike against -- the

1

2

trainmen picketing of the terminal began and effectively.

3

There was a construction of that assumed jurisdictionover

4

interchange to initially not permit picketing of the terminal

5

company and ultimately to permit picketing of the terminal

6

company.
And then in 196? in this case, with a different file

1
8

number, nonetheless, the Court has again, but with a differat

9

file number, assume jurisdiction to determine whether or not

10

we and I say, in this, ”we5' is the Brotherhood of Locomotive

11

Engineers, can picket the Moncrief Yard.
All of these cases are all interrelated and they all

12

13

have impacts back and forth on each other.
Q

14

May I ask you a question?

Supposing that

15

Judge McRae had allowed dismissal of Atlantic Coast Line’s

IS

suit? or suppose that that particular suit had not been in

17

existence at all, could you have gone into the State Court —

18

to the Federal Court to bring an original action and bypass the

19

State Appellate procedures and ultimate review here, if it 'was

20

granted?
A

21

22

23
24
25

If there was no jurisdiction thathad been

assumed by the United States District Court or no orders that
needed to be protected or effectuated, I would say that we
could: not.
Q

Well, could you have gone into any of these other
43

1

pending suits?
Ik

2

We could»

1 thinkthat we could have gone into

3

the Government’s case, the good-faith bargaining nexus is

4

exactly the same there as inthe Galveston Wharves case# which

5

we will discuss after a bit. . And we gone in# if permitted# into

6

the case in which there was already assumed jurisdiction#

7

what’s called the "6316 case," or the initial case assuming

8

jurisdiction over interchange,,
Once# and as we come later ~ I’ll get into it as

9
10

quickly as I can# into the 2283 question --- once there is

1!

Federal jurisdiction to determine the controversy# we’re in

12

far enough so that an injunction may be issued.

13

case like that you probably wouldn’t get into the area of

14

"should it be issued?”
This case makes# as we will show later# an over­

15
16
17
18
19

20

whelming posture for the "should” aspect of it# but what, the
statute says on the 3Scould#“! or the power# is simply a case.: in
which it is necessary to aid jurisdiction or a case in which

an order needs protecting or effectuating.

This Petitioner is not# however# a party in any of
the actions that you are talking about; is he?

That’s what the

Congress says.

11

Q

Well, now, is that a. litigation that involves

this labor dispute with FEC?
A

It is, and that the petition, thatis the com­

12

plaint was filed in that case on January 27th, four days after

13

the strike commenced, by the FEC, against these other carriers

14

saying that they, the other carriers were refusing inter­

15

change, that they had imposed an embargo and indeed, they had

16

imposed an embargo»

17

And the labor organisations were not parties, but

13

the justification given by the defendant railroads, that is

19

the other railroads, was that there was a. labor dispute and

20

these people, that is our people, would picket the interchange

21

and so they wanted —

22

Q

23

repeat it to me again?

24

a judgment in that case which would entitle the union now to

25

You probably already said it, but will you
If I understand your argument there is

relief inthat action of the kind you got here against the State

45

1

Court suit.

2

A

How does that come about?
All right»

That — the injunction in that ease

3

applied to the Atlantic Coast Line and its employees and

4

terminal company and its employees»

5

Now, that is an injunction — the jurisdiction of the

6

Court is over the question of interchange and it applied to

7

employees and --

8

Q

How are you going to get into that suit? that's

9

what I'd like to know.

10

A

Well, we would be by intervention, but the

II

question is a question simply: “How does 2283 read?”

12

instance inthe Capital Service case •—

13

Q

For

I appreciate it, but you answered Mr» Justice

14

Harlan that if this present proceeding hadn't been brought at

15

all in the Federal Court, that nevertheless, you'd be able to

16

get in, as I understood you to say, into this interchange case»

17

A

Well —

18

Q

In

19
20

a way that would entitle you to have the

same relief that you .actually got in this case? is that right?
A

Yes»

Now, we actually win a battle? the way we

21

won a battle was in 1965 we filed another case to construe —-

22

we sought intervention and were denied it and Judge Tuttle

23

discusses that in the case

24
25

one of the Jackson Terminal

Company cases»
So then we filed a suit to construe it
46

1

Q

Where did you bring that one?

2

A

Before the same judge in the same court.

3"

Now,, that one didn’t reach any final determination,

4

because in the meantime, in IS66 the trainmen went on strike

5

and began to picket the terminal which was normally in violation

6

of the injunction and the same judge, Judge McRae, enjoined it

7

initially and then later his injunction was reversed by the

8

Fifth Circuit.
So that as a practical matter, that original case,

9
10

6316, the original embargo injunction case, has beenmodified

Ii

by the J6S case and by the 567 case, this case that’s presently

12

before this Court, all of which deal with the, reallythe same

problemss

the interchange between the connection carriers and

this railroad.
Q

Well, basically, then your argument is, is it,

that the 2283 problem is that this interchange act has a judg­
ment of which this present proceeding protects or effectuates;
X

is that it?
A

No; our basic answer is thatJudge McRae has, as

he says, "determined the right to the parties" in this order on
appeal he says, “I delineated the rights of the parties; I did
make a substantive determination between the parties." .
Now, assume that he was wrong about that, that he
really hadn’t done that, that Mr. Lyons is somehow right that
all his order was was a Norris-LaGuardia order.
47

Certainly he

1

assumed jurisdiction to do that.

Q

Well,

He’s had jurisdiction

know, but to protect or effectuate

what judgment?

4

A

Well,-the language of the statute does-not re­

5

quire that there be a judgment to be protected or effectuated.

6

The language of the statute iss "where necessary in aid of its

7

jurisdiction,"

8

Q

Oh, I see? is thatthe one you are relying on?

9

A

We rely on both of them, because they are both

to

in point.

11

wasn’t an order that required protection.

12

—■ well, even if it was? we say it was, because he said it was.

13

Even if it wasn’t, he certainly could assume jurisdiction to

14

determine the legality of this conduct.

15

What I was saying is that even if his

s67 order

In the first place

So, he certainly has the jurisdiction.

Now, we've

16

heard over here that everything was dene, everything was done

17

in this litigation to entitle them to a final judgment.

18

forget the exact terms, but you recall when they — when Mr,

19

Lyons talked about it, and so did Mr. Friedmann, that after

20

this injunction against the State Court proceedings was entered

21

that they asked Judge Scott, the other District Judge, to

22

either set it aside or give them a final judgment, because

23

everything that had been done, all the facts were in and all he

24

had to do was just enter a finai order.

25

mean, that's where the case is, it's a question of either our

48

I

And th&fc'ss true; I

1

conduct is legal or illegal.,

2

it is legal conduct and when he made that ruling back in 1967,

3

and this is along the lines that there is a judgment to pro­

Judge McRae says he's ruled that

4

tect or effectuate, he — this Court had not yet ruled in

5

Jacksonville Terminal, but. you will see in his opinion or order

6

that he cites Section 20 of the Clayton Act.
Now, this Court has heard about Section 20 of the

7
8

Clayton Act from us since 1966, that Section 20 of the Clayton

9

Act, as discussed by the Hutchinson case, and Norris-LaGuardia

10

breathing lif«S into the — back into Clayton» is then our

II

position on legality from the beginning'and‘that1s what Judge

12

13

McRae said in his ordex in!1967 and that was before the order
r
of this Court, to be sure; but thatfs what his determination

14

was.

15
16

He determined that Norris-LaGuardia applied, but he went
(
much farther than that.
He also, in terms of this order being an order which

17

is necessary to protect or effectuate, he cites he finds that

18

we were engaged in a major dispute and he cites the B&O case,

19

which is the standard, very recent case, saying that once you

20

had exhausted the procedures of the Railway Labor Act; once

21

there was a major decision, then you were entitled to self-

22

helps you had a legal right to self-help.

23
24
25

Ndw, the content of self-help is something else, but
it has certainly been said often though by this Court that
that self-help implies, as it must, since there is the duty to

49

1

bargain in the Act, it m@st imply primary strikes and primary

2

pickets „

3

Now, he cites the B&Q case.

This is a major dispute.

4

He talks about what we did.

Now, 1 haven't gotten into the

5

facts and 1 may never have a chance to get very far into the

6

facts, but we’ve heard over and over again and this Court has

7

heard over and over again, this great tale of horror: the

8

world is going to come to an end.

9

Now, since 1963 one road train has been 32 minutes

10

late and the yard in this case was 15 hours late, but that’s

II

all that’s ever happened and all that’s ever happened is that in

12

the exact place where the Florida. East Coast Railroad ends,

13

and I’m not talking about ownership; I’m talking about where

14

its railroad trains run.

15

Atlantic Coast Line property where they complete their business ,

16
17

IS
19

20
21
22
23
24

In this case they run into the

They make a deliver andfchey make pickups, and the employees of
the neutral, the Atlantic Coast Line, are people that, under
any idea of primary picketing, we are entitled to ask: "Don’t
pick up and don’t make deliveries to the primaries."
Now, this happens to foe a case, this Moncrief Yard
picketing in which every effort was made to limit the matter
of picketing so that it would have the effect only on pickups
and deliveries.
Now, we didn’t even use a picket line.

If we put a

picket line up at the one and only entrance, the only place
25

50

1

that employee of Atlantic Coast Line go to work in the Moncrief

2

Yard is at this one employee entrance. ' If you throw up*, a

3

picket line there, those employees whose duty it is to. make

4

pickups and deliveries through the PEC within that yard where

5

the FEC engines come, no other place to reach those people and

6

if we put a picket line there, that closes the yard down.
Now, there is this assertion over' here made that

7
8

that's really what we had in mind doing, that we just, wanted

9

to close the yard down.

Now, what we did, I might say, is we

JO

let the people go to work.

We just asked them, a simple facts

t.l

"Don't handle the interchange," and that’s what they did.
Now, that relates back, because that’s what Judge

12

13

McRae found in his order and I'll show youthat in just a

moment.

15
16
17
13
19

invoked the jurisdiction for the purpose of entering some
orders pertaining to alleged secondary conduct and this Court
held that that was proper under 2283 and the injunction against

that it could make a determination.

similar to, really three cases.

3

cause the difference there> the Board invoked the jurisdiction

4

as only the Board can under that Act.

5

parties who may invoke the jurisdiction of the Court,

Here it is private

But, the Looney case is a case that goes back quite

6
7

a number of years, but the.Looney case is a case in which this

8

Court, approved an injunction against a State Court Case, State

3

Court injunction in a Texas rate dispute, the way I think of it,

10

in any event, and that case, the Looney case is discussed

11

it's quite significant because it’s like Capital Service in

12

that an injunction was issued? it was in aid of jurisdiction,

13

but of the Court, rather than to protect or effectuate a

14

j udgment.

15
16
17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

But, the Looney case is of particular significance,
because it is discussed at length in the Toucey decision, the
Justice Frankfurter opinion for the Court, and Justice Reed's
opinion for the minority.

And in both, the majority and the

minority, the same conclusion is reached about Looney.
The — Justice Frankfurter in that case said that
that case was granted merely to protect this jurisdiction until
the suit brought by the carriers was finally settled.
How, the significance of that is this:

2283, Mr.

Lyons has suggested to us that 2283 has a lot of pigeonholes,
and this doesn't fit. a pigeonhole.
54

The pigeonhoi® for a race,

1

there is a pigeonhole for a removed case? there is a pigeonhole

2

for a fully-adjudicated case.

That's all he said the pigeon­

3

holes ware in his main brief.

Now, a lot of cases don't happen

4

to fit in those pigeonhole, but 2283 isn't a pigeonhole

5

statute.
The history of 2283 is that it initially was a flat,

6

7

blanket statement by the Congress that District Courts shall

&

not enjoin State Courts, and then eventually, the.,bankruptcy

9

addition came into it.

10

And then finally in 1948 it was changed

because of Toucey„
But what had this ‘Court done in the meantime?

1?

This

\2

Court had said that obviously there are situations in whichit

13

is necessary that having jurisdictioni, a District Court has

14

got general equity jurisdiction and. it's got to be able to

15

protect that jurisdiction.
And sof various cases came along and Looney wasone

IS
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
23

of them that it was necessary to protect the jurisdiction.

Now,

Justice Frankfurter in 1941 in the Toucey case, said that the
policy

against enjoining State Courts was so great that even a

fully-litigated case that was a money-judgment diversity case,
the policy of the United States against enjoining State Courts
was great enough to require somebody who fully litigated the
matter in the Federal Courts, to go ahead and just plead it as
i

res adjudicata, and go on all the way up again through the
State system and back around.
55

And that was reversed by Congress

So, you no longer, you have an entirely different

1

statutory format, starting in 1948.

It isn’t a question any­

3

more of the Court having to look to some general equity con­

4

siderations, b\it the Congress has said and the revisors say the

5

same thing.

6

ularly the language of Congress, "the District Court may.'enjoin

7

wherei necessary in aid of jurisdiction or to. protect and

8

effectuate judgments. "
Now, you have both here, and really the question is

9
10

They don’t limit it to pigeon holes, but partic­

the question of the "should,” aspect.
Q

11

Well, you don’t suggest, do you, that this

12

s67 judgment was res adjudicata on the railroad, do you?

13

Insofar as- precluding it from going into the State Court

14

under
A

IS
16

17
18
19

not do: right, wrong or indifferent, that that impinges upon
the jurisdictionof the Federal Court which was assumed to make
those determinations.

23

25

We also say that —

10
11

Well, what jurisdiction would the Federal Court

have had to deal with a state law question?
A

Well, there is no longer a state law question,

12

but I would assert, based upon last year’s daterminaion in this

13

Court, but at that time,, if the Court had jurisdiction as it

14

did, under the Railway Labor Act and underthe Interstate

15

Commerce Act, it could use whatever body of law that there was

16

that was applicable under pendant jurisdiction or ancillary

17

jurisdiction.

18

It’s — the District Courts of the United States

19

every day apply State Law and it’s usuall in diversity cases,

20

but they also apply State Law in pendant jurisdiction cases

22

where, in this case, it would be the Railway Labor Act.
"Q

What you’re saying is that in ’67 the District

from interference by any court under the Federal Law?

That is what we say he did.

Correct? yes,

And you5re saying that the railroad, going into

the State Court may be enjoined because it5s acting contrary

to at least the declaratory judgment that was entered against

it?
A

7

Yes.

Defendants can win — I mean, it is the

8

position of Mr. Lyons that, well, if you rule for the plain­

9

tiff and donst grant an injunction, then nothing has happened.

10

Defendants can never have the benefit for this doctrine, or

u

benefit of protection if it had been, let's, say a fully-

12

litigated case, with res adjudicata,

13

something different,.
But, somehow, if the defendant gets ruled for that

14
15

I suppose that would be

that isn't an order requiring some kind of protection.

IS

Well, he did rule the question of the legality, the

17

issue of legality of our conduct was submitted, to Judge McRae

18

in 1367.

19

a question up until this past year as to whether or not there

20

might be some independent State remedy as it was thought, that

21

could intrude into Railway Labor,

About that there can be no question.

Now, there was

Now, as long as that was the case, and the suggestion

22
23

is made; "Well, if it's whatyou say it is, why didn't you go

24

in in '67?

25

of really, a "should" proposition.

Well, you are into the area then of the question

58

Until this Court had ruled,

fi

and, incidentally, the arrangement was with counsel, that we

2

would let the 1967 picketing cases lie until this Court had

3

ruled and when this Court had ruled, within about two weeks, we

4

were in before Judge Luckie, so why — the reason for not going

5

in in 1967 is that a Federal District Court, with that question

6

remaining as an open question would be reluctant to enjoin, not

7

because he couldnt’, not because it didn’t, interfere, but

8

because that just wouldn’t — you'd never get somebody to do

9

it„ is really what's involved.

4

10

But once it's clear that that interferes, it is not

U

a question of trying a res adjudicata defense? it’s not a

12

question — under the statute it’s not a question of any

13

of those things.

14

action fetters the Federal Court in making its determination,

15

or it is contrary or, in some — it doesn’t really even need to

16

be contrary as long as it’s necessary for ---- that there is some

It’s simply a question that fcheStafce Court

reason for it to be necessary for the Court to take action, and
here that is really very clear.
Now, it is said by Mr. Lyons that Richman Brothers

20

ends the matter, because Richman Brothers says that there’s a

21

forbidden fruit here, that you can’t try a preemption court

22
23

24
25

defense in the Federal District Court, that you’ve got to let
that go on up.

Well, that isn’t what Richman Brothers says.

In Richman Brothers, there was no jurisdiction of the
United States District Court.

No, no.

The opinion of the Court in the "should'

area is Justice Frankfurter again, writing, the author of
Toucey„ and he writes lots of reasons why it shouldn81 be done,
but fundamentally it all does come back down to the question of
there was no jurisdiction to aid or a judgment or order to be
protected»
Now, Professor Moore has something to say about this.

17
18

The opinion of the Court isn’t written quite

that simply; is it?

11
12

Now, the

language —

10

No; there's no jurisdiction anywhere around,

so there was no jurisdiction to aid and there were no orders

There is no jurisdiction in either the State

Professor Moore says the ~ and this Is on page 43 of our
brief — "the second exception permits the Federal Court to
grant an injunction against State proceedings were necessary in
aid of its jurisdictione"
judicial

This puts*, back into 2283 some of the

flexibility which Toucey had removed from the statute»

And, despite the strict reading of 2283 by Richman Brothers,
flexibility still remains for Richman, as we shall see, held
only that the District Court had no jurisdiction to. aid, but if,

25
60

on the other hand* the Federal Court has jurisdiction, then
under the terms of 2283 it may enjoin State Court proceedings
where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction„

Looney case is still the law? the Looney case doesn't fit into

13

anybody's pigeonhold; the Looney case is simply a. case in aid

This is what the Respondents say about Looney, and

the Sperry Rand case;

Looney -- the

principles of Looney were certainly carried forward and pro­

22

bably broadened, but at least carried forward in the s48

23

25

revision and that is certainly within thelanguage of 2283»
How, the reason that this case is the strongest case
that — of any case for the application of 2283, is this;

62

1

there are at least 30 or 40 separate cases? the District Court

2

has had innumerable cases involving this? the Fifth Circuit has

3

had opinions that I don't thinkyou can number on two hands.

4

All of these matters, ultimately come down to one

5

thing, that the Florida East Coast strike will be settled only

6

if there is bargaining, when

7

Now, there has been no economic power, no economic sanction

3

that could be put to bear upon the Florida East Coast Railroad,

9

since the first two years of the strike, except the economic

you finally come down to it,

10

sanction of asking the employees of the neutral railroads not

11

to deliver cars to the FEC„

12

Now, in a situation like this, and the reason, really,

13

I think that the economic sanctions initially didn't bring any

14

kind of settlement, was beca\ase the FEC immediately started, all

15

of these illegal operations of which, there is, a proceeding now

16

about restoration of the status quo, and so forth, but they,

17

effectively, through illegal conduct, wanted that,,

18

the fault of Atlantic Coast Line»

That’s not

19

But, also, from the very beginning, the other fora of

20

primary activity and surely there must be some way in the rail­

21

road industry that you’re entitled to ask the people who make

22
23,
24

25

• £
pickups and deliveries, in the terms of the Steelworker case
or in ther terms of this Court last year, not to do that.

And,

of course, one knows that in this industry that they w©n3t do
it if you ask them not to, so there is ah economic power that

63

i

!

has never been used».
That is what is involved in this case, and this

2
3

Court has decided that State Courts have no business in this

4

field»

5

that interferes with jurisdiction assumed over the bargaining,

6

over the self-help rights of the railroad and over the

7

question, not only of interchange between the carriers, but

8

interchange as it affects the rights of these people»

9

all one ball of wax, but if, for instance, let us assume that

That interferes with, not only the Federal scheme, but

And it8s

10

operations from certain matters,

I forget exactly what they

were at the moment, but some matters of its collective bargain­
ing agreement.
Now, there w©uldn5t be any hesitation, I daresay,
if that injunction by a State Court would come within 2283 and
be stopped, and this' is simply the other side of the coin and
the only reascan it looks any different in perspective is because
the order says, "okay? d©od; or at least I*m not going to give
relief against it»"

And so you can say that isn't some kind of

affirmative duty, but it bears on — the Court assumed juris­
diction over the legality of this conduct»

Mr. Mi1ledge referred to a number of other proceedings

20

There ware three proceedings, essentially$ one of them was the
so-called Clerk's case, to which the neutral carriers aren't
even a party.

The other is a proceeding in which there has

21

never been an order entered of any affirmative or even negative

sort, and the only other one is this 1963 case and the only
23

order that's ever been entered in that, and we discuss all of

This case is quite different# then, from the Looney

8

case which was mentioned frequently by counsel in his oral

9

argument.

In Looney there was an affirmative interlocutory

10

injunction granted by the Federal Court.

11

ordered the taking of certain action which was inconsistent,

12

completely inconsistent with the Federal Court injunction.

the Federal Court injunction was interlocutory.

to a specific exception to the statute.

10

The exception, I think, that the Respondents are

1?

trying to urge on this Court is the exception that we heard
