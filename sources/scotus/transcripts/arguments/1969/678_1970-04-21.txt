Mr. Chief Justice? may if please the

Courts

9

This is an income tax case on a writ of certiorari

10

to -the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

11

The question is whether a balance, in a reserve for bad debts

12

maintained by a partnership and stipulated by the parties to

13

be reasonable, must be taken into ordinary income or not by

14

the partnership when it incorporates its business under Section

15

331 of the Internal Revenue Code — Section 351 providing that:

?©

"No gain or loss will be recognised if property is transferred

1?

to a controlled corporation.”

18

that the transfer, the

19

purview of Section 351.

What would have happened to this reserve if

they had liquidated, Mr. Apolinsky?

Would it have gone into

And if

It wouldn't have entered their transactions,

at all?

A

No, sir.

Q

Each would have taken his pro rata part of the

receivable and his pro rata part of the reserve?

9

A

Yes, Mr. Justice,

io

Q

The partnership, whiles it has to report as an

ii

entity, isn't a taxable entity, basically?

ia

A

That is

right.

It is a

group of individuals,

A

That is

right,

13

Now in this situation, this partnership operated

10 finance businesses:

2 in South Carolina and S in Alabama.

17

It made loans to the public, and it used the accrual method

18

of accounting, under which it would take into its ordinary

19

income the profit on a loan, the receivable, in the year in

20

which the loan was made and the receivable established.
It accounted for its bad debts by the use of the re­

21

22

serve method for the bad debts

allowed under Section 166 of

23

the Code,

24

It can use the direct charge-off

23

to charge against income in the year that the account goes bad.

Actually, a tax payer can use either of two methods.

method, which allows you

Or a tax payer can anticipate its losses *— as far

as specific accounts are concerned — and establish a reserve

for bad debts, and, based on its experience, estimate the

amount of the accounts receivable which will go bad and charge

to the reserve are, likewise, charged against income as a

They are limited, of course, to the reasonableness
which, in our situation, is stipulated.

On May 31, 1960 the partnership had approximately

11

$487,000 worth of receivables in these 8 Alabama offices and

12

approximately a $73,000 balance, in its reserve for bad debts,

13

applicable to those 8 offices.

14

It then, on June 1, transferred to 8 separate

corporations.

In 1962 the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued

6

his revenue ruling, 62-128, where he first expressed the

7

position that the reserve being maintained by a partnership

would be taken back into the ordinary income of the partner­

ship when it transfers its assets, even though such transfer

10

be under the tax-free rule, generally, of Section 351.
Thereafter, the Commissioner’s agent - examined the

11
12

returns of the partnership, made a determination that the

13

§73,000 of the reserva should be restored to the ordinary

14

They would 'take — Well, that is a difficult

18

question to immediately answer for this reason;

19

say that, if you had a taxable sale of -the receivables at net,

20

21

they seek to offset a return of -the reserve to income by a loss

22

on 'the receivables.

23

They would

Because

They say, however, in our situation, this is a tax-

24

free exchange which precludes recognition of gain or loss.

25

Therefore, there is no loss which can be recognised to the

9

1

transferring partners to offset the return of the reserve to

t

income .

3

Their position in a taxable exchange would be that

4

there would be no income, but, if we had a transfer of -the

5

receivables in exchange for cash in a non-taxable environment,

6

then their answer would probably be the same.

7

Q

They think if is different then if ~ if the

8

corporation and the partners had been valuing the assets to

9

be transferred and

specifically allocated a value to the

10

accounts receivables at face amount less the amount of the

II

reserve?

12

&

Their result would not be any different.

13

Q

Even though the corporation didn81 purport to

14
IS

pay you any more than net amount?
A

Had the corporation, instead of setting up

16

the reserve, simply established on its books receivables at

17

the net amount of $414,000 — the net amount — their answer

18

would have been the same*

19

Q

They still think you have realised income.

20

A

They still think we have realised income.

Now

21

they cite — which 1' think is a good case, and I wish I had

22

cited it — the Shelly Oil opinion, where they say that the

23

Court will not permit any double deduction.

24

with that decision, it would be inconceivable that if a

25

corporation tried to come into court later on, or a tax payer
10

I believe that,

f£

tried to coite into .court to gat a second deduction,, that that

£

would ever he allowed.

3

Q

Let ae test you position from another angle.

4

Suppose — and this is a large hypothetical# because it wouldn't

5

happen ~ suppose# after the corporate reorganization was

6

completed# someone carae along and offered to buy all of the

7

receivables of the new corporations# which had just been

8

transferred to it# for* 100$ on the dollar,, then what would

9

happen to the reserve?

10

A

This is what would happen# Mr. Justices

The

11

corporation would -then have recovered the full amount of its

12

receivables.
Q

13
14

Well# they would be charged all of the bad

debt lossf. the reserve would then go into income# wouldn't it?

15

A

Would go into income by the corporation.

16

Q

This hasn't happened and never will happen# unless

17

sotse fairy godmother comes along and buys these at 100$ on

18

the dollar?

19

A

That is right.

And if it happened quite soon

20

after the incorporation# 1 think the Commissioner would coma

21

in and say# "The reserve wasn't reasonable in amount#" and

22

would probably seek to have the partnership pay soma income

23

tax on it.

24

got other rules that they would apply and we would not argue

25

ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. SIMM

21

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

22
23

MR. ZINN:

24

Q

25

Very well* Mr. Apolinsky.

Mr. Chief Justice; may it —

Before you get under way* would you clarify —

perhaps for all of us* but at least for me — what has
14

1

changed here, in your judgment, by this transfer except the

g

form and structure of doing business.

3

A

That is precisely all -that has changed, Mr.

4

Chief Justice, just the form in which the business is carried

S

on»

6

Q

There is no change in substance?

?

A.

That is correct.

Although, as we pointed out

8

in our brief, Section 351 transfers can apply where an entire

9

business becomes a corporation or where a single asset, an

10

account receivable or any other single asset, is transferred

11

from an individual or partnership to a controlled corporation.

13

Q

What business i-^as this partnership engaged in?

13

A

It was engaged in the business of financing,

14

Mr. Justice.

15

0

tending money?

16

A

I believe so.

17

Q

13

Is there any challenge to the question as to 'die

amount, they have tried to set aside for bad debts?

A

19

No, Mr. Justice.

If I understand your question,

20

the reserve ‘that was on the books of the corporation at the

21

time of the transfer — on ‘the books of the partnership, excuse

22

me, at the time of the transfer was reasonable, if the partner-

23

ship continued in business,

24

ship

ated, and all of its assets, including its accounts receivable,

But the fact is that -the partner­

didnst continue in business.

The partnership was termin­

‘
j

i

were transferred to the corporation

z
3

Q

Why did that change the situation with reference

i

to the reasonableness of the amount?
I

4

A

We think that when a partnership terminates, or

5

when an entity terminates, -the tax benefit principle requires

6

that a deduction be restored to income.

7

events have demonstrated that that entity is not entitled to

S

the deduction.

9
10

Because subsequent

Q

Does the record show that?

The subsequent

A

If the partnership and corporation are consi­

events?

11
12

dered to be separate entities, I don’t think there can be much

13

question that the partnership's need for the reserve ended.

14

The Ninth Circuit, in the Schmidt Case upon which

15

petitioners rely, defeerrtdned that the need had terminated.

16

Q

But they merely changed -the —

17

A.

The form of the business, as the Chief Justice

18

asked.

19

Q

From a partnership to a corporation?

20

A

That is correct,

tod Mr. Apolinsky, this

21

morning and in his brief, has relied heavily on the legislative

22

history of Section 351, which provides for the non-recognition

23

for gain or loss.

24

statute to this Court, and I would like to do that.

25

It sayss

But he did not read the language of the

"No gain or loss shall be recognised if

1

property is transferred to a corporation or one or no re persons

z

solely in exchange for stock or securities and immediately

after the exchange such person is in control of the corporation *

Yes; but Section 351 only prohibits the

FURTHER ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. 2INN

4

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

5
6

up where you left off.
MR. SINN:

7
8
9

Mr. Zinn, you may pick

Mr. Chief Justices may it please the

Court.
In the few minutes I have remaining I should like t©

10

discuss the two proposed solutions of petitioners to the

11

double deduction problem here; that is the carryover solution

12

and the adjustment of basis solution.

13

Section 381 of the Internal Revenue Code is the

14

principle provision which allows for carryovers in certain

15

transactions.

16

such as the one here, which is described in Section 351. It

17

applies only to certain intercorporate transactions.

IB

That provision does not apply to transactions

In addition to the absence in Section 381 of a

19

specific congressional authorization for a carryover, it is

20

well-established that a transferee, in a Section 351 trans-

21

action, is a new taxpayer and can adopt its own accounting and

22

its own taxable year, including, in this specifice case, the

23

specific charge-off method of accounting for bad debts.

24
25

We think, therefore, there is a real risk of a double
deduction if this Court should hold that the tax benefit principie
30

1

is not applicable here»

2

Third* we point out that Congress has been quite

3

specific when, it wanted items to be carried over in a Section

4

351 transaction.

5

the basis of property shall be carried over.

e

attempted to outline for the Court this morning, a reserve for

7

bad debts is not property.

Thus* Section 3S2 of the Code provides that
But as I

V

&

Similar carryover rules —-

9

Q

10

Well, would you distinguish it in that respect

from a depreciation reserve?
A

11

No, a depreciation reserve is not property

n

either.

13

a depreciation reserve is specifically provided to reduce the

14

basis of the depreciable asset.

That is under Section 1016(a2),i

15

Mr. Chief Justice.

specific provision that is

16

comparable to that, allowing a basis reduction for a bad debt

17

reserve.

18

But, under Section 1016 of the Internal Revenue Code,

There is no

I should also point out that, in attempting to

19

analogize a Section 351 transaction, to bring it within the

20

spirit, if not the specific language, of Section 381, that

21

Section 381 applies only to transfers of entire businesses.

22

|

Whereas, Section 351, as I mentioned before the recess, applies j

23

t© a transfer of an entire business, as in this case, or to

24

transfer of a single asset.

Q

Let's assume that this wasn't a 351 transaction,

that didn't suffer it? and that once w® know that the partner­

with any more bad debt deductions than it would have wound

up with had it been ©n the specific charge-off method of account

would not have gotten this deduction for future losses which it

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD I. APOLINSKY

OH BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. APOLINSKY;

Mr. Chief Justice*, if if please the

Court;
I think that -the statements of Mr. Zinn points up

1

the problem they have in applying the tax benefit rule

II

realistically.

12

it„ Certainly, in the taxable exchange area when there is

13

a cash sale of accounts receivables, the

14

in their brief, says that you restore to income a deduction

15

when you recover it.

They set forth the rule, but 'they don't apply

rule, as set forth
\
;

16

Well, if you have a sale for the receivables at

17

gross, that is a recovery, and it would come into income.

18

you have a sale at net, the most logical conclusion, it seems

19

to me, is that you have no recovery under the tax benefit rule.

2

And, therefore, there is no income to the taxpayer selling in

21

a taxable transaction.

If

22

The Government, in order to bend the rule to fit our

23

tax-free situation, sets up a hypothesis that they have a loss

24

realised on the receivables which counteracts the return

23

income of the reserve, and the wash result is a net of sera.
36

to

1

We say that is sn incorrect approach to the problem.

2

The loss occurred when the taxpayer got ’the deduction for the

3

reserve — when he set it up, that is when 'the deduction
f

4

i
occurred.

The fact that later on he sold at net was merely

5

a realisation that his estimate, his loss, was correct? not a

6

subsequent loss down the road to offset some artificial

7

inclusion in income.

I

We further say that we do not agree in our brief —
and our brief, X think, shows that — -that there is a different

W

rule to apply in Section 337, liquidation.

that, because it is covered in my brief.

that we did agree, and we do not.

I did not cover

But Mr. Zlnn said

In fact, the revenue ruling in 1957, where the

14

Government covered the liquidation under a one-year liquidation

rule, specifically set up the hypothesis that the corporation

sold its receivables at face.

comes back into income.

rule in its proper application.

They said, therefore, the reserve

X also take issue with Mr, Zinn

when he disputes

21

whether, upon the liquidation of a partnership, the reserve

comas into income of 'the partners.

23

rata liquidation of a partnership under Section 736, -there is

24

no recognition of income to the partners.

25

!?

In my judgment, in a pro
'

X would just focus our attention, if I will •— The
38

1

Government has assumed, as we said, that there is a problem of

2

a double deduction.

3

a double deduction, because there has been no — in ©ur case

4

no one has tried t© take a second deduction, and in no case

5

discussed today or in any of the briefs has any taxpayer

0

attempted to take a second deduction at any stage.

7

basic hypothesis for the need for the revenue ruling is, it

8

seems t© ms., unfounded; that there is no second deduction to

9

guard against, and, ‘therefore, without that problem there is

We maintain that there is no problem of

So that the

11

But under that section

The solution, if we v?ere

'12

to assume for argument there is a problem, under that section

13

the solution has to be consistent with the statute.

15

if, it doesn't say, "from property".

17

legislative history of that Section points out that that is not

18

a taxable event.

Section

It is not tied to the

It says, "if property is transferred?" that the

It is just a change of form.

19

In 1924 Congress, in reviewing it, said, "No gain

20

or loss,” and then in the next sentence they said, "This is

21

not a time for the realisation of income."

22

So, we say there is no magic in saying that what we

23

have over here is income, and the statute should have said,

24

"No gain, loss or income.”

Because in 1924 they used the two

And that is what is going to

So what has happened since 1962

is that people with

encourage business readjustments — and even spoke of art! icial

transactions — that they were going to place tills tax-free

21

Congress in 1921 said to

The simplest thing, I think, is not to look to a

22

specific solution to a double deduction.

23

Or simply for the Court to remind -the tax bar — as we don’t

need reminding — of your decision of Skelly Oil? there is

25

just not going to be any second deduction allowed, irrespective
