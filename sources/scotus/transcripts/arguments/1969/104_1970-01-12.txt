ORAL ARGUMENT BY MATTHEW J. SINN, OFFICE

OP THE SOLICITOR GENERAL, ON BEHALF OF

THE PETITIONER

7
MR. SINN:

Mr. linn,

Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

This is a Federal, tax-lien case here on a writ of

10

certiorari totha United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth

II

Circuit.

of improved real property,

located in Livingston County, Michigan, is prior to the interest
in -that property, by the subsequent purchasers of the property.
The United States, acquired its lien in 1950 when it

15
18

It involves the question of whether a Federal tax

secured a tax court judgment against Thomas"Donnelly for some
$28,000.

Then that judgment, went unpaid the United States

acquired a lien under Section 3670 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1939, which appears at Page 17 in the appendix and the lien
t
arose in favor of the United States, and I quote:
;
‘Upon all property and rights to property, whether
real or personal, belonging to such person."
In 1945 in this Court's decision in the Glass City
Bank case it was held that the lien of the United States under
Section 3670 applies not only to a tax payer's present property,
2

I

1

but also to any after-acquired property, to insure that its

2

lien would be prior

3

and others, however, the United States must give due notice of

4

the lien by filing a, notice of the lien in accordance with the

5

provisions of Section 3672 of the Internal Revenue Code, which

6

also appears, beginning on Page 17 of our brief.

the interest of subsequent purchasers

Section 3672 provides that, and I quote:

7

"Such liens

8

shall not be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser

9

or judgmen; creditor until notice thereof has been filed by the

to

.collector,

u

is authorised by the law of the state or territory in which the

(1) In the office in which the filing of such notice

property subject to the lien is situated, whenever this State
or territosry has by law authorized the filing of such notice
in an office within the stafc© or territory, or (25 In the
office of the Clerk of the United States District Court for
the judicial district in which the property subject to the
lien is situated, whenever the state or territory has not, by
law, authorized the filing of such notice in an office within
the state c-r territory»"
In short, the question of whether the United States
is to file locally under Subdivision 1 of Section 3672(a) or
subdivision 2 thereof, turns on whether the local law authorizes
local filing.
The Michigan statute which purported to authorize
local filing here appears on Page 18 of our brief.
3

And, with

1

respect to real property it provides in the prepenultimate

2

line on Page 18 ohafc a description of the land upon which a

3

lien is claimed is to be included in the notice of the lien.

4

The consistent practice of the United States, how­

5

ever, is not to describe any property in a notice of lien, but

6

simply to file what is commonly referred to as a blanket notice)

7

of lien, which merely reechoes the provisions of 3670, names

8

the taxpaysr and specifies the amount of his indebtedness to

9

the United States.
■ j
En United States against Union Central Life Insurance,

10
11

Company, decided by this Court in 1961, it washeld that the

12

Michigan lax?, because of its description requirement, did not

13

authorise Local filing and that the United States in that case

14

had properly filed its notice of lien in the Federal District

Court.

description of the property was given, placed obstacles to the
enforcement of Federal tass liens that Congress had not per­
mitted, and consequently, no state officer was "authorised8

when Mrs. Donnelly died, and by operation of law, Mr. Donnelly

10

became the sole owner.

prepared by the Livingston County Abstract Office, which

15

covered only the local filings in Livington County, Michigan,

16

and which, specifically accepted, covering any filings that

17

were made in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District

18

of Michigan.

The Carlsons were bona fide
They had an abstract

19

The attorneys who passed upon the marketability of

20

the title for the Carlsons relied upon the abstract that had

21

been prepared, by the Livingston County Abstract Office, and

22

accordingly, they did not find notice of the Federal tax lien

23

that had been filed in the District Court".

24

After the Carlsons purchased the property in I960 the
United States moved to foreclose its tax lien.
3

When the

1

Carlsons objected they moved for summary judgment in the

2

District Court and summary judgment in their favor was granted.

The Sixth Circuit affirmed on appeal without opinion.

Is this a relatively unique situation that is

involved in this case, or is it just elsewhere in the country*
too?

is in here.

really trying to get at.

S

Honor?

12

A

Is this case a kind of sport, that's what I'm

We don't think it is.

Thereare several

13

hundreds of cases in Michigan which we thinkthe decision here

n

would control, sind in addition, as we pointed out in our brier,

15

there are some 4G,000 tax liens that might be cast in jeopardy

16

in four other states; Illinois, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and

17

Massachusetts if the Court were to affirm the judgment below.

18

19

Q

these liens in the Federal records?
A

20
21

Why is it that ? ifcle-searchers don't, search for;

I, frankly, don't know, Your Honor. It seems toj

us that they have every reason to do so, as I hope to explain
later on.
Q

But, of course, the Government doesn't suggest

the Carlsons or the title searchers or their lawyer had a.ny
actual knowledge of the filing —
6
i

i

A

We concede that they are bona fide purchasers.

2

Q

But you do say that they should be charged

3
4
5

with the knowledge of that filing?
A

Yes, sir; we do.

We say s© because we think

Union Central is —

6

Q

This is rather tough on the Carlsons; isn't it?

7

A

It is.

8

()

Except that there wasn’t any reason to do so,

9

for the title-searchers to do so at the time the search for this

10

title was made, unless I misunderstand, something here, because

11

of the existing decision in the United States Court of Appeals

12

for the Sixth Circuit; is that correct?

13

h

We think there was every reason for* them to

14

do so, even though they had — the Youngblood decision, is that

15

the one the it you are referring to?

16

17
18

Q

That's the one I had in mind, 1 think; yes, in

which — and that was the law, so far as Michigan liens went
at the time that this search was made; wasn't it?

19

A

20

(i

What's the date of Union Central?

21

A

1944.

1 don't think it was.

And Union Central held that a. local

22

Register of Deeds was not permitted to accept for filing a

23

nondescriptive Federal notice.

24

Moreover, in 1945 —

25

C

Did you say the date of the Union Central was

7

1

19447

You misspoke on that.

2

h

The date of Youngblood.

Youngblood? yea.

And Youngblood held that a local Register of

Deeds is not entitled to accept for filing a nondescript i ve

But we would suggest that that

all dictum; the only issue in that case was wh*

/er the United

States was entitled to file a nondescriptive notice in the
local Michigan courts.
But, there are a number of other reasons why a titlesearcher in 1960 should, have searched the Federal files, as
well as the local files.

One year after Youngblood, was decided,

the court bald in the Glass City Bank case that the United
States’ tax lien under 3670 applied to after-acquired property.
New, after-acquired property cannot be described in a j

!9
20

The United States moved tomandamus the Register of

law within the meaning of 3672.

14
15

That was the only issue in that ease,, Your

notice which was previously filed, so we think a reasonable
lawyer or reasonable title-searcher would well have been on
notice as to the possibility of the liens that were Federallyfiled.
Moreover, in 1952, as we pointed out in our brief, an
'

25

article appeared in the Michigan Law Review, which said that
8

t

lawyers perhaps have a need to check Federal filing.

2

In 1958 --

3

Q

4

h

Arid on what grounds?
On the grounds that the Glass City Bank and

S

the ground that the statute and legislative history as con­

6

strued by the Sixth Circuit were just construed wrong.

7
8

3

Q

On the ground that that decision might be

wrong and might some day be overruled.
A

Well, I don’t know overruled.

As I say, we

10

view the remainder of the opinion in Youngblood, beyond the

n

point where the court held that a Federal nondescript!ve was not

12

entitled tc filing as dictum.

13

Now, 1 conceded that the court made it quite clear

14

that it was reaffirming its decision in the Maniachi case, but

15

nevertheless was dictum.

16

us, cannot stand together and Glass City was decided only a

17

year after Youngblood.

18

Glass City and Youngblood, it seems tc

The Wright article in 1952, we think, suggested that &

19

problem existed and in 1958 in the Rasmussen case, the Eighth

20

Circuit,reached exactly the contrary conclusion from the con­

21

clusion whish the Sixth Circuit had reached in its dictum in

22

You gfolocd.

23

And so, by the time the. Carlsons purchased this

24

property in I960 it seems to us that it was clear enough that

25

there was a problem.

But we don’t say that the law was clear;
9

1

we do say that there was contusion? and we think this con­

2

fusion was recognised by the title-searchers in Michigan and

3

that is the reason why they accepted from the abstract, to get

4

themselves off the hook from Federal filings.

5
6
7

Ml of these reasons, we think, undercut the argument
that tfee Carlsons made that they justifiably relied —
2

In terms of the hardship or good faith,, would

8

there not oe exception in the title opinion to put a reasonable

9

person on notice that there might be an inquiry to be made at

10

It

the District Clerk’s office?
A

We think it would, but respondents tell us

12

that everybody did. it the other way and nobody paid attention

13

to the Federal filing»

14

Our position here is: where they're asking that Onion

15

Central be applied perspecfeively only is that they have to show

16

some real justifiable reliance to warrant an exception to the

17

general rule applied by this court that its decisions apply

13

retrospectively as well as prospectively and we don't think th@5

19

have? indeed, the Mortgagee in the Unior Central Case,

20

was in precisely the same position as the Carlsons were here.

21

They couldn't have known that Youngblood was going to be dis­

2£

credited by this Court, but there is no hint in Mr. Justice

23

Black’s opinion that that decision was to be prospective only.

24
25

Regarding this question of prospectiveness versus
retroactivity, we have reviewed the- —

The Michigan Law has been changed?

A

Yes, it was changed in August of 1956.

U
A

... Right.
At which time Michigan adopted the Uniform

Tax Lien Registration Act.
In addition to the justifiable reliance; claim,, the
Court in its decision in the Linkletter case and the progeny
of that case, largely in a criminal area, in deciding whether a
decision should be spoiled prospectively cr retroactively.

Pnd more recently in Ciprlan© against City of Yuma, a
voting rights case, have locked to three factors to determine
whether it should be retroactive or not.

The first, as we have

mentioned, is justifiable reliance and for the reasons I have
outlined, we don't think that the Carlsons could have justifiably

25

XI

1

relied.
Phe second factor is whether the purpose of the new

2
3

rule would be frustrated if the decision were applied prospec­

4

tively only.

S

the change in Michigan Law to which Mr. Justice Stewart re­

6

ferred? there would be no other cases? probably? that would be

7

governed by Union Central and Union Central will stand by it­

a

self as a one and only decision having no application outside

9

of its four corners.
Finally, the Court has looked to whether the effects

Here we think it would because? as a result of

of holding a decision prospective in the criminal area,
whether the effect of that would impair the adminisration of
v

criminal justice? and it seems to us that the analogy here is:'
what would it do to other Federal tax liens?

And again? as I

have noted, it would cast a cloud on some 40,000 of them.
8o„ for all of these reasons, I don’t think that
Union Central can be considered a "Prospective only" decision?
that it is clearly governing here.

The same law was construed

by this Court eight years ago when it was held not to authorize
a Federal filing.
I might add that the —

I might say that the Carlsons did have a terrible

these liens.

In the Maniachi case, which was decided by the

to the interest of a subsequent bona fide purchaser,.

In Youngblood,, it tried to file its notice Federally

That is not the case so far as the opinion of this Court

The point the District Court seems to make is that

17

had the United States attempted tofile locally it would have bee,

18

accepted by the Register of Deeds here, and therefore this

1©

would have glvennotice to the Carlsons.

20

is the case or not, because the United States did file a non­

21

descript! ve notice in Maniachi and it was held that the sub­

22

sequent purposes, nevertheless, prevailed.

23

We don't know if that

Moreover, the law as expounded, by the Michigan

24

Attorney General in 1953 in his decision that Federal non-

25

descriptive notices were’ not entitled to be filed locally, was

nothing new.

the land is unmistakable and the authority of the Register of

Deeds, a ministerial officer, is clearly limited to the recor- i

This is what the Sixth Circuit held in 1944 and this

Q

9

i. what the Attorney General held in his opinion in 1953. It
was nothing new.

Court:

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please the

As my learned colleague indicated, this is really the

case of the United States against Oscar and Genevieve Carlson,
and not the estate of Donnelly, who has been dead now for some

six years and who would care less as to what the outcome of thin
matter is.
But, as indicated, the home of the Respondent Carlson
stands in jsopardy at some $36,000 in tax liability of the late
Mr. Donnell/, whose relationship with Carlson was merely that
of seller to buyer.
Q

And Carlson is the admitted.

Why is it that in Michigan there is no search

for Federal liens, by title-searchers or lawyers?

A

Mr. Justice Brennan, in 19.23 ~

Q

The reason I ask is this was just commonplace

when I was in practice in my home state.

The Carlsons —• the lien in this matter was filed in
1950 at a time before the facts which were referred to in Union
Central occurred , and the trial court distinguished this case
from the Union Central case.

But the trial court went on

further with the decision in the Chicot County case and the

other decisions in this case* indicating that when vested

that the Chicot case and the Rockaway New Supply case, the
Linkletter case, all dealt with other area, but the premises
therein that a right becomes vested, that this Court has a right
to make such a determination that these rights shall not be
affected by the decision and that these decisions should not be
retroactive where the effect would be such, as it is in the
Carlson case.
The Government is well able to protect itself in tax
lien matters and has shown the ability to protect itself.

raised here in regard to the necessity of recording a tax lien

notice when after-acquired property is involved.

Mow*, the

10

matter is covered in our brief; we feel that it is an issue

n

that has never been passed upon by this Court.

12

14

that the entireties property which was -'acquired by Donnelly - and j hi

wife in 1949, was not Donnelly’s; for that matter, was not

Donnelly’s for the tax lien notice to attach to, until I960,

when Mrs. Donnelly died and the property at that time became

16

that of Dm nelly and we cited in our brief, the Hutcherson case,

17

as well as the Nathanson case and the American National Bank

ihe Hutcherson case by the Court of Appeals, as well
as the American National Bank case, both indicate that the
32

1

Federal tax lien does not attach to entireties property until

2

the death of one of the spouses.
i

3

::t is our position that a clear reading of the Inter­

4

nal Revenue Code recording provision would require the filing

3

ofa notice as against after-acquired property in a state where

6

such a notice had not been previously filed at the time such

7

property was acquired by the taxpayer.

8

Now, the Glass City Bank case? as my learned colleague
'
I
indicated, says that a tax lien attaches to after-acquired

9

SO

property. . But there is a void as far as the law is concerned,

t!

as to what the Government must do to protect that tax lien

12

against such after-acquired property.

■

13

The lien is a legal status; the notice of thatlien is

14

a notice tc* the world which protects that lien as against inter­

15

vening third parties and in this situation the Government has

16

said, in effect, that If Union Central applies to the Federal

17

filing of the notice in this case in 1950 that that notice in

18

1950 is good in perpetuity to all notices filed in the Federal

19

Court on forever until those liens:are no longer enforceable.

20

Ve feel that this is not the law and is not the intent

21

of the law.

The Internal Revenue Code says that notice shall

22

be filed whenever the state has designated a state office.

23

word "whenever" means at such time as, and I don’t think that

24

the Interne.! Revenue . Code has to be construed tomean that a

So that their foresight, as distinguished from

hindsight, their foresight has protected them in the same manner
the purchaser could have protected himself, by saying, in
effect, if his lawyer was not experienced enough? "What do you
mean by this, and how much does it cost?"

And, upon finding

that it would cost $3.00 or $4.00 to make that search routinely,
or even less, depending upon the number of entries, he would
have been protected; wouldn't he?
A

I would say that that may have been but at the

time there would have been a question whether or not even the
entry of a Federal recording would have been, anything except
actual notice, as opposed to constructive notice, until the
Union Central case was handed down.

The Federal filing may not

that there is a void, Mr. Chief Justice, in the law as to
whether actual notice stands in the place of constructive notice

And, contrary to what the District Court said on Page 56

ground that the United States should have refiled in 1960, after
Michigan had passed the Uniform Tax Lien Registration Act in
1956.

With regard to that, I think that the differences between

this Court's views and that of the Sixth Circuit, are made quite
clear.
With reference to the Sixth Circuit!s opinion in the
Faulk case which is pending on the Government9 s petition for
certiorari, Number 344 and the statement of fir. Justice Black's
in the Union Central case.

In order for the United States to

refile every time a deliquent taxpayer acquires property after­
wards it has to follow that taxpayer around and keep tabs on him
Now,in the Faulk case, which is quoted on Page 13 of
Respondent's brief:, the Sixth Circuit said, and I quote;
38

1

"Some scrutiny of the affairs of delinquent taxpayers,
ii

2

sufficient to enable it to know where to properly file notice

3

of lien, seem fcohave been contemplated by this entire statutory

4

schema, requiring the Government to investigate the affairs of

5

the delinquent taxpayer to determine to what property the

6

statutory lien attaches and therefore, where to.properly file

7

the required notice of lien in no way cuts down on the broad

3

scope of the Xian,” That is not the case and that is to be

9

compared with the statement of Mr, Justice Black, 368 0„ S.

10
n

294, and I quote:
"It's obvious that this expansive protection for the

12

Government, that is, the protection that its lien runs to after-

13

acquired property would be greatly “reduced if to enforce it,

14

Government agents were compelled to keep aware at all times of

15

all property coming into the hands of its tax delinquents,"

16
17
18

‘Ihe Sixth Circuit has been out of -^tep since the
Maniachi ca.se in 1940.

The United States files both locally and

Federally in that case, and it lost.

It attempted to file

19

locally in Youngblood and it lost.

20

here and there is no basis for prospective only holding.
