ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR, JAMES:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
This matter is before this Court on the petition

10
11

of the State of California intending that the Supreme Court of

12

the State of California improperly and incorrectly interpreted

13

the rulings of this Court on the question of the confrontation

14

clause of the Sixth Amendment and that, pursuant to that

15

misinterpretation of that confrontation clause, the Supreme

16

Court of California held unconstitutional a state statute

17

that would have permitted the admission for the truth of the

18

matters asserted, prior inconsistent statements of a witness

19

who was present at trial and subject to cross-examination.
It was only a few weeks back, I believe, that this

20

21

Court had occasion to view another aspect of the confrontation

22

clause and in Illinois vs. Allen held that a defendant could

23

deprive himself of the right by his conduct to be present in

24

court.

This Court has been consistent in holding that the

4

Sixth Amendment right is a right at trial, a right to conduct

5

cross-examination of the accusers, of the witnesses against

5

the particular defendants.

7

In the first case where this Court held that the

S

confrontation clause was obligatory on the states, Pointer vs.

9

Texas, this Court said;

“As has been pointed out, a major

10

reason underlying the constitutional right of confrontation is

11

to give a defendant charged with crime an opportunity to

12

cross-examine the witnesses against him."

13

This Court followed that with the case of Barber vs.

14

Page, emphasising that the right to confrontation is basically

15

a trial right.

In a companion case to Pointer, Douglas vs. Alabama,
this Court used these terms;

"Our cases construing the clause

(referring to the confrontation clause) hold that a primary
interest secured by it is the right of cross-examination.

An

adequate opportunity for cross-examination may satisfy the
clause even in the absence of physical confrontation."
In that particular case the defendant Douglas had a
co-defendant who was separately tried, one Loyd.

Loyd was

This Court held that the defendant Douglas had been

denied the effective right of confrontation, because he had no

11

opportunity to cross-examine the witness who was exercising the

12

privilege against self-incrimination.
In Bruton, a more recent case, discussing the aspects

of confrontation, this Court said, in reference to the Douglas

15

Case;

We noted that effective confrontation of

The California Legislature in 1955 adopted the
Evidence Code of California, incorporating in that code the
other provisions contained relating to evidence in the Code of
Civil Procedures and other codes and abandoned by the adoption
of that code the so-called "orthodox" view as to impeachment,

substantive evidence.

The factual basis upon which this case arises

9

Q

Before you conclude the facts of this case,

50

General James, is there any available evidence showing the

15

legislative history of this amendment of the California Code?

12

Is there anything that you know of that shows why the state

13

legislature did this?

14

h

15
18
17

Yes, Your Honor.

The code commissioners, when

the Evidence Code was being considered by the legislature, made
comments.

The comments of the code commissioners are contained

in the cods.

I believe they were quoted in our petition for

18

certiorari and also in our brief file for the petitioner herein.

19

The code commissioners9 notes were also referred to in the notes

20

of the committee for the adoption of the rules of evidence for

21

22
23
24
25

the federal courts and magistrates.
Q

These notes indicate what?

That this was a

response to some sort of a felt need or was just this the
academic rule and these commissioners wex*e academic people and
they thought they better put in that rule? or what was it?

Wigmore in his latest work and as expressed by McCormack in his

work on evidence,

There was no reason why

I think in our petitioner’s opening brief, at pages

6
7

36 and 37

where we are discussing the reasons by the advisory

8

committee for the proposed rules of evidence for the federal

9

courts and magistrates, they adopted a portion of the code

10

commissioners’ notes, and it is contained therein.

t'l

states that Section 1233 admits inconsistent statements of

It generali?

12

witnesses, because the dangers against which the hearsay rule

13

designed to protect are largely non-existent.

14

Then it continues, and it concludes by citing McCormack

15

and his coda in evidence.

And then the advisory committee for

16

the federal rules states:

"The advisory committee finds these

17

views more convincing than those expressed in People vs. Johnson,

18

which was a predecessor of the Green Case.

19

requirement that the statement be inconsistent with the testi­

20

mony given assures a thorough explanation of both versions while

21

the witness is on the stand and bars any general and indiscrim­

Moreover, the

The commissionersf notes are contained in the number
of volumes which preceded the action by the state legislature
in adopting the Evidence Code.

But the minor witness testified that he couldn't
11

1

remember what happened because he was under the influence of

2

LSD.

3

At that point the people introduced, pursuant to

4

Evidence Code Section 1235, a portion cf the direct examination

3

of this witness in which he related that the conversation over

6

the telephone with the defendant Green related to a sale, the

7

selling by Porter of a kilo of marijuana.

8
9

The preliminary testimony was that the marijuana came
in 29 "baggies" in a large shopping bag.

The witness at the

10

trial was asked if this was his recollection as to what occurred,

11

and if that was the way he testified, and if he believed he was

12

telling the truth when he testified at the preliminary*

13

he said, "Yes, I believe it to be at that time, yes."

marijuana, a portion of which he had ultimately sold to this

So again the people, pursuant to Evidence Code Section

19

1235, referred this time to the cross-examination of the minor

20

witness at the preliminary hearing, in which he acknowledged

21

that the marijuana was pointed out to him by the defendant Green,

22

23
24
25

apparently at the defendant Green's father's home.

ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. GRISWOLD;

8

As Mr. James has said, there are two pieces of

9

May it please the Court;

evidence involved here, both prior inconsistent statements.

10

First is the testimony at the preliminary examination where,

11

I may point out, there was confrontation in a physical sense.

12

That is, the defendant was himself present and saw the witness

13

who testified.

14

made to Officer Wade.

15

The second piece of evidence is the statement

Both Porter, the witness who testified at the prelim­

16

inary examination, and Wade, the officer to whom the statement

17

was made, were present at the trial and subject to cross-

18

examination.

19

was, of course, an official record.

20

And the testimony at the preliminary investigation

I think I may point out, too, that in this particular

21

case, the trial was before the court without a jury, because

22

the defendant had waived a jury.

23

this should lead to any difference in the result.

25

But we do not. believe that

California against Johnson, decided a couple of years ago in

14

which this Court denied the State's petition for certiorari,

All of those tilings go to the weight of the

evidence but not to its admissibility.

This leads directly to

10

the first point of my argument which is that this case is not

11

a Sixth Amendment case.

12

of confrontation, because the right of confrontation was fully

13

vindicated.

This case does not deal with the right

The witness Porter was present and sworn and subjected

14
15

to cross-examination.

The trier of the facts had full oppor­

16

tunity to see and hear him, to observe his demeanor, and to

17

form a conclusion about his honesty and trustworthiness.
That conclusion might well have been that he was a

13
19

very devious person who probably spoke the truth shortly after

20

the event but, for one reason or another, found it convenient

21

to be forgetful and. evasive at the trial.
And similarly with respect to the other item.

22

The

23

in the Johnson case, that this is not a constitutional require­

ment, but that you can feel satisfied that, nevertheless, justic

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

25

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

Q

Before you get under way, Mr, Prettyman, may I

ask if you know — because I am not sure I could see it in the
record — whether, in the California Supreme Court, the
insufficiency of the eviden.ce to support the verdict was urged
37

1

by the petitioner here.

2
3

MR. PRETTYMAN:

It was urged before the California

Supreme Court, and they reserved judgment.

4

I might say that I view the record in this case as

5

the Solicitor General does, but, perhaps, with more alarm.

6

And I have not raised the issue in my brief for the simple

7

reason that I was appointed after the petition was filed and

8

granted.
Consequently, I found myself bound by the issues

9
10

there presented.

But, if for some reason I do not prevail

11

here, I would certainly intend to urge before the California

12

Supreme Court on remand that this conviction cannot stand on

13

such paltry?- evidence as we find in this case.

14

Q

Even assuming all the evidence?

15

A

Even assuming that all came in.

As a matter

of fact, I would urge the rule — which as I understand it has

not been decided by this Court — as to whether a

Before, during

this 16 year old made four separate and self-conflicting

statements in regard to this crime.

According to Wade, Porter told him that some weeks

.22

before Mr. Green had called him and then had come by his house

23

and brought with him a bag of marujuana.

24
25

The second statement was made at the preliminary
hearing of Mr. Green after he had been arrested as a result of
41

j

s

the first statement.

Mr. Porter was still in custody of the

2

police, still in jail? his case had not yet been disposed of.

3

That hearing was held only eight days after Mr. Green’s

4

arrest.

5

At the hearing Porter testified this time, not that

Green had brought a. bag of marijuana to his house, but rather

7

that lie had come and taken Mr, Porter over to the house of Mr.

8

Green’s father and had showed him some marijuana behind a bush,

and Mr. Porter had come back on his own that night or the next

day and picked it up.
How, 1 might say that there are a number of inconsis­

I want to emphasize that at the preliminary hearing

22

Officer Wade, to whom the first statement had been given, did

23

not testify, and no mention was made of that first statement.

Therefore, Porter’s attorney apparently had no view of it, had
no idea that he given a previous inconsistent statement.

Another thing about the preliminary hearing was that

was going to develop later.

Now, we go on to the third statement.

S

Q

What you are really saying is -- if I get

7

the argument is — that the relevant point of confrontation

8

is not confrontation at the trial, but absence of confrontation

9

at the time of his out-of-court statement?
A

10

Is that it?

If I may state it just a little differently, Mr.

11

Justice?

that the point of confrontation is to look the

12

witness in the eye, have the frier of fact look him in the eye,

13

not as he is talking about some other statement that he might

14

have made at. some other time, but when he is talking about the
.

15
16

crime, when he is saying the words that convict.
This whole cross-examination at the trial was not

17

about the crime.

The cross-examination was, "Well, now did

18

you say something to somebody else back there?"

And he is

10

saying, raI am really not sure; I can’t remember."

20

The third statement was given at trial.

21

22
23
24
25

At this

point it is important to note that this young man was no longer
in custody; his own case had been disposed of.

This is the

first time, now, that he is out of the hands of the police.
And what dees he testify tc now?

He says,."Well, if you want

The best we can make out of

entirely innocent of the offense and that he, Mr. Porter, had

in their hands and because he was unable to distinguish between

reality and fantasy.

This follow-up statement that he made after tria..

I would like to ask you another question;

That is right.

And they come up and prove a

A

I think, conceivably, that might be used soley

19

to impeach, and, incidently, I have some question even on that.

20

Because in order, at least in the federal courts, to impeach

21

you have to have both surprise and affirmative damaging

Now the State has a quite simple argument, deceptively

so.

6

say quite simply that so long as the witness is available at

7

trial, so that the trier of fact can look him in the eye, what

8

possible harm can be done in putting in the prior statements?

Well, the answer is great deal of harm can be done,,

5

MR. PRETTYMAN; May it please the Court:

6

There are three basic ingredients of the right of

7

confrontation which I would like to discuss, all three of

8

which were missing in this case.

9

the least important of the three, but, nevertheless, I think

The first one is, perhaps,

10

it is a factor? it is the requirement that the witness make the

II

incriminating statement at the crucial hearing itself, so that

12

the subjective, moral impact of the courtroom is brought to

13

bear on it,

14

seriousness, the gravity of the proceeding and the necessity

15

for telling the truth,

16

17
18
10

So that he fully realizes the importance, the

I am not going to elaborate on this except to say
that it is a very far cry from giving a statement to a police
officer at juvenile headquarters than if is from giving it
under oath before a judge or a jury, facing the defendant in

20

the courfcr om itself, where the issue of innocence or guilt

21

is going to be decided.

22
23
24
25

The second basic ingredient is viewing the contem­
poraneous demeanor of that witness, the concept that the
witness will make his inciminating statement in front of the
trier of fact.

So that the trier of fact, then and there,

49

1

as the words are said, can determine whether this man is

2

telling the truth.

3

The State says that you can judge his demeanor at

4

trial as he is asked about his statement.

5

at trial in any way comparable to the demeanor on the prior

Q

occasion?

But is the demeanor

Of course not.
Porter, in the hands of the police, implicates Green.

7
8

Porter, out of the hands of the police, fails to implicate

Green.

We can see his non-implicating demeanor at trial.

10

his implicating demeanor is lost to us forever.

11

way we can go back and pick that up.

12

There is no

That

In this case, if the judge at trial found that Porter

17

was telling the truth about taking LSD, it follows of course

18

that Green’s conviction cannot stand.

19

the effect of the LSD was such that he simply did not know the

20

facts about -the crime.

21

Because Porter said -chat

have lied at trial or all three occasions.

!

It is not enough to see the man's demeanor now,

2

weeks or months after those statements were made»

3

be able to compare demeanors, to see the demeanor now and

4

the demeanor then.

You have to

As a matter of fact, there.is a very great danger here

5
6

Because I think there is a tendency to feel when a man is

1

lying at trial, if he has made a prior statement that is diff­

8

erent, to feel automatically that the other statement must be

9

true.

But that again just isn’t so.

Q

10

What would you do, Mr. Prefctyman, on that thesis

with the traditional hearsay exceptions, dying declarations

for example, where the same arguments can be made that you

13

are making now?

14

too?

t5

16
17

A

Would you gay that those are unconstitutional

No, Your Honor.

In the case of the dying

declaration you have two elements that are lacking here.

is there is an assumption that if the witness were available,

18

if he was here at trial, he would tell the same story that he

19

told before.

20

refuted and rebutted.

2!

at the trial, and you are looking him in the eye, he has a

22

23

25

You assume that.

Here that is completely

Because when the man gets on the stand

The other thing about the dying declaration is that
it has a very high degree of probability of truthfulness.

The

Courts have always assumed, perhaps rightly or wrongly, -that

51

■I

2

Q

Those are legal presumptions that have the force

3

of tradition behind them., and it seems to me that would suggest.

4

perhaps, the earlier question I put to you as to whether or

5

not your argument doesn’t turn on the particular facts of the

case rather than to a general rule as to the scope of 'the

Your Honor, I think the facts of this case point

out rather dramatically the dangers here, but there are other
cases which point it out just as well.
Now that you have asked me about that, let me turn

to the case that the State is asking you to overrule today,

How can this defendant,

in this case — when we

talk about the right of cross-examination — how is he
supposed to cross-examine a man who says that he knows nothing
about the offense because he had taken LSD?

How is he

supposed to cross-examine him about a statement made to a
police officer at juvenile headquarters, when the kid had been
incarcerated for four days — nothing had happened in his
trial, only the two of them were present?

He later says in

his fourth statement that he had given it partially because of
police threats.,

Sir, 1 am going to address myself very shortly to the

14

proposition that testimony at. a preliminary hearing is a very

15

far cry — as this Court has said — from testimony at trial.

16

And the right of cross-examination is quite different at the

17

preliminary hearing than it is here.

18

Q

Why?

I never heard that before.

19

A

For this reasons

In the first place

the

20

preliminary hearing is held as soon as possible after arrest and

21

sometimes contemporaneously with the appointment of counsel.

22

Quite often, in the state courts and even in the federal courts,

23

the first time that -the appointed attorney sees this man is

24
25

when he walks into the preliminary hearing, because he was just
appointed»
57

1

Secondly, the issue at the preliminary hearing is

2

a very narrow one.

3

it is whether there is simply enough evidence to say that

4

there is probable cause to hold the man.

It is not guilt beyond a reasonable doubt;

5

Q

What effect does that have on the examination?

6

A

Because, sir, in the first place the cross-

7

examiner has not been able to find the facts.

In this case

3

this trial attorney was retained no mors than six days and

9

perhaps ——

10

O

I understand that, but I can’t understand the

11

reason for your argument that the examination is somehow

12

different.

13

A

1 was saying cross-examination, Mr. Justice.

14

Q

I don’t understand why it would be different.

15

It is not in ray state, and I don’t know why it would be gener-

16

ally.

17

A

In the first place, as I say,the attorney 'who

18

is going to do -the cross-examination simply has not had time

19

to gather the facts to prepare for effective cross-examination.;

20

In this case, for example, the attorney knew nothing about

21

Officer Wade’s statement and he knew nothing about LSD, just

22

by way of example.

23
24
25

In the second place the courts are constantly striv­
ing to keep the issue at the preliminary hearing narrow.
in the district defendants have attempted a broad gains
58

Here

3

cross-examination, attempting to use it for discovery purposes

2

to all the whole range of facts surrounding -the case, and

3

they have been denied that righto

4

no; so long as the issue is the very narrow one of probable

5

cause, that really is all that you can cross-examine»
Q

6

The trial courts have said

But it's a probable cause of guilt in each

7

case either in the preliminary or the other; one is the probable

e

cause of guilt and the other one is just guilt»
A

9

Well, one is whether there is probable cause

30

to hold him, and the other one is whether there is guilt beyond

II

a reasonable doubt»
Q

12

And those standards ---

That is right, but the issue is not what it

13

decides is the same.

14

there is some, difference.

But that

is why I was asking you this question about why the difference.
Sometimes a preliminary is not tried for months, 2 months, 3
months.
A

Well, on the other hand, the whole purpose of

the preliminary is to hold it at an early
Q

That is not the whole purpose, not an early a

A

a time as possible.

They are not always held that early.

requires you do it within 10 days unless you waive it.

What I am saying to you is that to have

i

Because I have tried many? we have examined just like

you on the regular trial.

There is no difference in it.

Some *

times it is a week, 2 months, something, but always we reallyhad a trial.
A

I can only assure you, Mr. Justice, that it is

quite different in many jurisdictions.

In many cases the

lawyer at the preli inary hearing isn’t even the same as the
one at trial.
Q

Suppose it is a jurisdiction which does have a

regular knock-down and drag-out trial in cross-examination?
A

Well, I would still say that if yon have a

man who gives one story at the preliminary hearing, whether
he has been cross-examined for 8 days or not, and he gets on
the stand at trial where the issue is entirely different and
gives a different story, that the prosecution is stuck with
•the story that the man tells on the stand.

Because the trier

I think this case illustrates the fact that there

8

may well have been enough evidence at the preliminary hearing

9

for holding the man.

But even the Solicitor General recognize a

10

that when you start talking about ultimate proof of guilt at

n

the trial, you get into some serious difficulty.

12

Q

Are you not drawing any distinction between

13

the legal relevancy of a statement made at a preliminary

14

trial, where there is a cross-examination, and one made to

15

an officer on the outsides

18

A

I think quite obviously that the statement mad

17

to Officer Wade has all kinds of problems to it, some of

10

which are less serious in the preliminary hearing.

19

I am saying is that to equate -the preliminary hearing and the

20

cross-examination allowed at the preliminary hearing with

21

the trial is simply not realistic^ And, as a matter of fact,

22

goes entirely against the grain of what this Court has said

But what

when, itself, has said that the preliminary hearing issues ar

The one where they have a chance for cross-

11

is made to an officer.

12

A

I have said to you, sir, that 1 do believe the: »

13

is a difference, and that 1 think that the difficulty with

14

the statement to Officer Wade is a far more serious one.

15

on the other hand, I still think that it is not enough to hav«

16

a man at a preliminary hearing simply cross-examine.

17

But,

If you hol'd -this way, look what is going to happen i >

18

the effective assistance of counsel.

19

fantastic pressure that this is going to put on counsel to

20

prepare themselves for a full, effective cross-examination at

21

that preliminary hearing?

22

Do you realize the

You have said -that counsel has to be at a line-up,

23

because it is a critical confrontation, because not to have hi t

24

present might derogate from the man’s right at ferial.

What

25

are you going to do about these preliminary hearings?

The

62

I

man has to prepare himself fully just, as he would for trial,

2

because, otherwise, he might miss his only opportunity to tear

3

this man's story down.
Many of these statements are taken, of course, before

4

S

there even is a defendant, such as in the Johnson Case and

6

such as the statement made to Officer Wade here.
Q

7

If the man testifies at the preliminary hearing

8

one way and then at the hearing on the merits he says I didn't

9

know what happened because I was on LSD, once he made that

10

statement, both the statement read to him and the statement

1!

which was made, the defense counsel has unlimited cross-

12

examination .

At the preliminary hearing or at the trial?

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

of why cross-examination at trial in regard to any previous
statement is not sufficient; it simply is not.

And the reason

is that when you have this man at this trial who says, 111
don31 know anything about the facts, because I was under the
influence of LSD," you can talk to him until you are blue in
the face about some prior statement, but what are you going
to get him to say?

truth since he was born.
A

20

I would like to think that is precisely what

21

was shown here, but the man was convicted on the basis of

these prior statements.

No, sir.

You would, therefore, never accept the old

A

The eo-conspirator exception only allows the

statement in to impeach the particular defendant against whom

4

it comes, and it is not allowed as affirmative evidence of

guilt as to the other party.

And the jury is so instructed.

It is going to gain a stature

Mr, Prettyman, when you say that this is the

universal view of trial lawyers, how would you reconcile that

8

with the recommendation of the American College of Trial
Lawyers, which certainly contains some of the most eminent

I©

trial lawyers in this country, and a great many of them with

n

approval of exactly what the Solicitor General and the

12

Attorney General of California are arguing here today?

13

A

I have, perhaps,miss hated, but I was quoting

14

Q

1 wasn't suggesting that you misstated, just

overstated.

16

A

I was citing, actually, the Eighth Circuit’s

17

statement to the effect that trial lawyers did not think that

IS

this was an adequate substitute.

IS

talking to trial lawyers is that they regard late cross-

2

examination, cross-examination long after the fact, as some­

21

thing that is totally unacceptable as a substitute for cross-

22

examination while the man is testifying.
Moreover, some of these codes and propositions

that have been put forward, you know, are not all like this
'

one.

Maguire, for example, — although he is cited as in

statements.

proceedings, which is far different.

that you can discover all these facts that you would need to

know for your trial or cross-'examination. But it is not

I think that the impetus to put off the preliminary

10

hearing as long as possible, so that you can prepare for it,

11

1 think is going to be a very serious result of all this.

n

The California statute is worried about the turn­

13

coat witness.

The answer to the turncoat witness is a speedy

14

trial.

15

because they want to get that evidence in while it is still

16

fresh in -the memories and the minds of the witnesses.

It is not — Right now prosecutors want a speedy trial,

Under the California statute, they couldn’t care less

37
13

about a spteedy trial.

They have got their case.

They have

19

got the statement before Officer Wade and at the preliminary

20

hearing, and they know they can go in and convict on that.

2!

I say that the answer to -the turncoat witness is

22

not to take away the most valuable single right the defendant

23

has in a criminal trial; and that is to confront and cross-

24

examine the witnesses against him as the crucial, incriminating

23

testimony comes in.

Now this argument that we have heard about contempor­

aneous utterances.

It comas, I think, from the Supreme Court

of California where they used the term "contemporaneous
confrontation", which isn't found in the Sixth Amendment as
far as I know.

It is a sort of "do-it-yourself constitutional"

attitude.
