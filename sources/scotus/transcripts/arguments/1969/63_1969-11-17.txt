and crew members who fish off the South Atlantic Coast and the
Gulf of Msasico for menhaden.

Number 63, the United

is not regarded as edible by humans but which is caught in large
quantities and processed into fish meal and fish oil which are
used primarily for fertilizer or for feeding poultry and other

IS
livestock.
16
The case comes here on a writ of certiorari to the
17
United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

The

18
statutory provisions involved are set forth in the Appendix to
18
the Government's brief at Page 39 to 41.
20

Now, before stating the facts it will be helpful, I
21
think to put ‘the precise terms of the statute before the Court.

22
The Old Age Tax is imposed by Section 3111 of the Internal
23
Revenue Code and in terms equal to the following percentage of
24
the wages paid by him with respect to employment.
25
2

1

And then in Section 3121 the term wages is defined.

2

Now, wages means all remuneration for employment and then in

3

3121(d) is a definition of the term "employee" to include any

4

individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in

5

determining the employer-employee relationship has the status

6

of an employee.

7

In this setting out in our brief of the statutory

S

provisions we omitted one at this point which may have some

9

conceivable application.

-It is in Section 3121(d) 4 and it

10

provides that employment shall not include services performed

11

by an individual on or in connection with a vessel not an

«2

American vessel or in connection with an aircraft, not an

13

American aircraft, if (a) the individual is employed on and in

14

connection with such vessel or aircraft when outside the United

15

States, and (b) such individual is not a citizen of the United

16

States or the employer is not an American employer.

17

an entirely exclusionary provision.

18

inference that it was intended to apply to American citizens

19

employed on American vessels by — owned by American owners.

20

Q

21

It leaves only the

Mr. Solicitor General, did you say that is

That is D-4. 33 21(d)-4.- contains a negative

23

pregnant that Americans employed on American-owned vessels are

24

covered.

I will say, as Mr, Lyman will remind you that that is

2

There is also an

3

Unemployment Insurance Tax,

The Old Age Tax, you will recall,

4

is imposed on both the employer and the employee, with the

5

employer under obligation to withhold the employee’s share and

6

pay over the total to the Treasury.
The Unemployment Tax is imposed only on the employer.

7

S

And there again, it is imposed at a percentage of the total

9

wages paid by him during the calendar year with respect to

10

employment.

This appears on Page 40 in the Appendix to our

11

brief.

term "wages” is defined to mean all remuneration

12

for employment and again we have the term "employment" defined.

13

The

And here in a somewhat more complicated manner.

Employment is

14

defined as any service performed — any service of whatever

15

nature performed after 1354 by an employee for the person employ

16

ing him.

(b) on or in connection with an American, vessel, and
then you come to the end of that at the top of Page 41, except
and this gets vary involved, because this exception I am about
to state is then subject to an exception itself.

Except service

performed by an. individual in (as as an officer or member of the
crew of a vessel while it is engaged in) the catghing, harvesting
vultivating or farming of any kind of fish, shellfish, Crustacea
and so on and here is the next exception:
Except(B) Service performed on or in connection with

vessel of more than 10 tons-

2

but then they except from that takeout service<on vessels of

3

more than 10 tons and all of the vessels involved in this

4

case were of mors than 10 tons, so that it comes within the

5

exception to the exception and this is included in the

6

definition of employment, but again, is subject to the pro-

7

vision in Section 3306(i) that, for purposes of this chapter,

3

the term "employee” includes an officer of a corporation, but

9

does not include any individual who, under the usual common-

So, they take out all fishing,

10

law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee

11

relationship, has the statos of an independent contractor, or

12

(2) any individual who is not an employee under such common-

13

law rules *

14

Now, that is the statutory setup»

It is part of a

15

large whole, but one can focus rather closely on those two

16

provisions s the one in the Old Age Tax and the one in the

17

Unemployment Tax which — by which Congress has emphasised

18

that the test of employment is the common-law — the usual

19

common law rules applicable in determining the employer

20

employee relationship,

21

Q

Mr. Solicitor General, as I read this now,

22

under your guidance, I gather that we come right down, with

23

respect to both taxes, to the definition of employee in each

24

case, don't we?

25

under the second tax we really end up at the door by which we

It doesn't ,add or subtract much of anything; is
♦

3

A

I think that’s exactly it, except that I would,

4

say that this definition comes as a piece of amosaic which

5

also includes some references to fishing and ships and boats

5

of more than ten tons and thus, it is perfectly plain that

7

Congress did not intend to exclude employment on ships such

8

as are involved in this case»

9

Q

10

A

Right.
But I fully agree that a large part of the

n

problem before the Court is this application of this common-

12

law test specified in the statute as to the facts of this

13

case.

Now, this case was tried before the District

21

Court without a jury and there was an extensive stipulation

22

of facts and there were also depositions and evidence.

23

all of which the District Court made findings of fact and con­

24

clusions of law.

The underlying facts are essentially not in

4

S

That seems to me to show a great potentiality for control by

6

the boat-owners, "This could occur only when a boat was in

7

port, arid before another fishing trip was commenced.

8

Inevitably, Mr. Chief Justice, and that, I

suppose, is inherent in the post of being the master of a

In the Gulf the temperature was high and

the trips were on® day.

The evidence shows that in the South

Atlantic they occasionally lasted three or four days.

They

were ordinarily short trips.

7

Now# I call attention to Finding 22 on Page 323.

a

In negotiating for the service of a captain it was understood

9

that the captain would select the crew members.

Prior to the

10

commencement of a new season the taxpayers, who are the boat-

n

owners and respondents here/ would furnish the captain with

12

the pay-scale of crew members and the crew size to be employed

13

for the season.

14

entire season, this information also was furnished the captain ”

If a bonus was to be paid for fishing the

15

So, I point out that the owners here fixed the — I

16

can’t, quite say the rate of pay, because under the lay system

17

the men are paid so much per thousand pounds of the catch/ but

18

they fix the rate per thousand pounds that the men ware to be

19

paid.

20

And then I call attention to Finding 24 on Page 324s

21

"Defendant contends and the Plaintiff denied that 'the captain

22

was required to pay a crew member not less than the scale

23

established by the Plaintiff.

25

pay scale of the crew, but also the number ofthe crewmen, to be

The testimony of the various

hired."
And finally of the findings I would refer to Finding
46 on Page 333:

,

"The plaintiffs did have the right to control the

5

results of the captain5s work and interferered on the process

6

to some degree to assure proper results from the undertakings.K

7

Next I would like to point out that the evidence is

8

clear that the captains were required to obtain from each crew

9

man,the evidence says a W-2 form, but the W-2 form is the one

10

by which you report to the individual at the end of the year

11

what has been withheld.

12

which is the employee1s withholding exemption certificate and

13

than it was also a part of the procedure, duly established and

14

carried out that the captains, at the end of each trip, turned

15

in the data with respect to the crex*men, showing which crewman

16

had served and what the amount of the catch had been and tfha.t

17

It's actually this, familiar W-4 form

the weight per thousand pounds was for each crewman and in ou

18

reply Lwief we have reproduced Exhibits 1 and 2 which were in­

19

troduced into evidence in the Court, below, and about which

20

there is no controversy or dispute„

These show that for each individual what is headed
at the top a payroll and they show the amount of fish caught,
the rate for each man, the total payment, the Social Security
Tax withheld, the Income Tax withheld, the amount deducted
for each individual for his share of the cost of food because

Finally, the balance and then 'also at the bottom of

12

tod finally, Exhibit 2 which is at the back shows

13

the individual record which was kept for each member of the

14

crew, again showing ‘these deductions which are aggregated at

15

the bottom of the page for the whole years, so that they could

16

be duly reported to the individual on Form W-2, the amount of

17

deductions for Social Security Tax, for income tax and for

18

other matters,

19

Sow, let me point out that, this — the fact that this

20

case is here it seems to me to be an instance of the difficulty

21

we sometimes get into in this country in administering rela­

22

tively simple matters.

23
24
25

It is nearly 30 years ago that the

Treasury issued a ruling with respect to this situation saying
that captains and crewmen operating under thellay system are
employees and are subject to the Social Security tax.
11

This is S8T, Social Security Tax, 387, which was

published in the Accumulated ^Bulletin for 1940, Volume I, and

3

is cited in our brief.

cases like the Silk case in 331 U.S., which involved’ another

16

They were coal unloaders

They furnished their own picks and shovels.

In this

case the men furnished nothing except the foul weather gear,
which would be boots and raincoats.
In the Silk case this Court reversed both of the
Lower Courts and held that the coal unloaders were employees.
In addition to the Silk ease, there are, of course, many cases
under the Fair Labor Standards Act and under the National Labor
Relations Act.
Now, it will be said by Mr. Lyman that neither the
Silk case nor SST 387 are relevant because they were both
issued before Congress amended the statute in 1948 and it was
l

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
:24

in 1948 that Congress put in this language about the common
law test to which Mr. Justice Stewart referred a while ago.
But, as is pointedout in our brief, at the time that
Congress put this into the statute, the legislative history
plainly showed that Congress was endorsing the Silk case.
referred to

It

the -- on Page 15 of our brief is a quotation from

the SEnate Reports
"In the view of your committee these decisions affirm
that the usual common-law rules, realistically applied, must be

25

12

'i

used to determine whether a person is an "employee” for pur­

2

poses of applying the Social Security Act."

3

And in 1950,, two years later* referring to the

4

situation the Conference Report said; "A restricted view of

5

the employer-employee relationship should not be taken in the

6

administration of the Federal old-age and survivors insurance

7

system in making coverage determinations.“

&

So, I find nothing to indicate that the language of

9

the statute put in in 1948 was intended - to repeal or overrule

10

the Silk caset nothing to indicate that the early administra­

11

tive interpretation should not be followed,

12

I would point out that we are hare dealing with, a

13

maritime employment; we - are necessarily concerned with the

14

customs of the aea and the law of the sea.

15

the sea it's perfectly plain that -these captains and crew

16

members would be entitled to maintenance and cure; would be

17

entitled to protection under the Jones Act.

18

Under the law of

The proposition that captains and crews under the

19

lay system are employees for purposes of the Social Security

20

taxes and it has been accepted by the Court of Claims in two

21

cases cited at Page 37 of our briefs and one involving fishing

22

for scallops from Net’? Bedford and the other involving fishing

23

for shrimp and oysters from the Gulf of Mexico* and also by

24

the Court of Appeals for ‘the First Circuit* affirming pro

25

curiam an opinion by Judge Genew in the District of Maine*

That involved, as far as

Mien the case came hare, this Court

reversed holding that it was not appropriate to disregard the
statue and ignore the restriction on injunctions against -the
collection of taxes, but that left standing the rest of the
Fifth Circuit decision and then the Corporate Packing case
cited on Page 37 and in this case the Court of Appeals has,
understandably, continued to follow its decision in the
Enochs case, otherwise repudiated by this Court that these
people were not employees.
Now, even under the common-law test; even if it*s

and crewmen same within it.

Here all of the capital came from

shipowners; they owned -the ships; they paid for their repairs
and for their fuel; they paid for the nets, which coat some
$10,000.

The rate of compensa­

ti on© £ the captains and crews was fixed by the owners? the
size of the crew

was

determined by the owners«.

The captains

could change this? but only at the expense of themselves of
all the crew.

The owners were the entrepreneurs? they were

in charge? they fixed the pay 'scale

They were clearly in charge and that should be

enough when the statute is realistically applied.

Sven under

11

a strict view of the common-law test. And when this question
J2

arises in a maritime setting? as it does here? that conclusion
13

becomes even more clear.
14

There are three ways? it seems to me? that this case
15

can be decided: one is practical and workable? the others lead
16

only to uncertainty and confusion.
17

First? the Court can hold that the captains and the
18

crews were the employees of the owners? thus reversing the
19

decision below.

That's what the parties actually did hare*

20

that makes the Social Security System realistic and workable as
21

applied to these workers who have no capital invested? no
22
management in the enterprise.

That puts the paperwork of

23

withholding and tax-paying where it can practically be handled?
24

asit was handled in this case.
25

15

/

(

Or second,, the Court can hold that the captains and

?

z

crews are not employees of the shipowners; that will eliminate

3

withholding of income tax and the worker's share of Old Age

4

Tax and it would eliminate payment of Old Age Tax and Unemploy­

5

ment Tax by the owners.

6

peoples would know where they stood.

7

captain and the crews would have to pay their income tax withou

8

withholding and would have to pay self-employment tax at an

increased rate,
Q

10
11

Now, this can be said for it.

That

But it would mean that the

Is there any chance that the members of the

crew would be employees of the captain?
A

12

I suppose sos I don't know. Some suggestion —

Mr, Lyman suggests in his brief -that they would be self-

employed and pay their own tax, which seems to me to be quite

13

unrealistic,

Q

Excuse me.

Bo you contend the conclusion of

the finding of no employment relationship is a finding ©£ fact#
subject to the clearly erroneous rule# or a legal question?
A

A mixed question of law and fact# I believe#

Your Honor.

Well# what if it is? what about on review?

A

Well# Your Honor# I would say that on review

that where a statute would preclude the decision of the District.

18

on appeal., where the statute would preciuse the- decision.
However, where fact elements as?e concerned, in this
mixed question, reviewing courts are bound bv the "clearly
erroneous" ruling and a reviewing court will set aside a trial
decision only when the facts found fall short of meeting the
statutory requirements.

I believe that was this Court's

ruling in Trust of Bingham.
Q

All that means is that the Court accepts the

historical facts found unless they are oleagly erroneous, but
then it’s a question ©f law as to whether they meet the stand­

arda.

'■

12

A

That's correct.

14

reviewing that conclusion from the facts.

15

A

I don’t see how it could be thdre, no.

‘16

Well, the simple issue before the District Court was

1?

whether the boatowxtera, and those are the respondents here,

18

were liable for the excise tax portion of the employment taxes

19

imposed on the earnings of th& fisherman? and that's the

29

captain and the crewmen„

21

The respondents9 liability of nonliability for these

22

taxes depended upon the definition of the term "employee."

23

And that term is defined in two sections of the Internal Revenue

24

Code? both of which adopt the common-law control test.

25

Now, the trial court held that the taxpayer

19

owners

1

had proved their claims for refund and as a consequence, the

2

fishermen were not their employees under those statutes.

3
4

For

other purposes they may have been, but under those statutes
they weren't.
Not, the Trial Court resolved all issues under, these

5

6

statutes? all issues of fact in favor of the boatowners and

1

particularly, those issues as to the absence of control over

8

the manner and method in which the work is done.
Now, the Circuit Court refused to sat aside the Trial

9
10

Court!s findings and conclusions since they were the result of

11

a choice between two permissible views of the weight of tha

17

I cannot imagine that an owner would just willy-nilly fire a

Of course, if the fish disappeared or the captain

13

Q

14

A

Oh, I see.
,

It was open to the District Court here to hold ft

15

purposes of these two acts, that fishermen could very well have

16

been employees of the owners.

17

18

But it’s obvious in the findings!

that the District Court had the common-law test clearly in
mind.

19

For example: the Court found specifically that the

20

taxpayer had no right to nor attempted to instruct, a captain

21

22
23
24
25

or a crew as to their fishing activity or how to accomplish it.
Another specific finding:

there was no express agreement

specifying the extent of the taxpayer’s control over the cap"
tain's activities.
Another:

It was clear that no actual control was

26

1

exercised over the details of the manner and method employed by

z

the captains and crews.

3

to control the results and interfered to a degree only to

4

assure proper results from the undertaking.

One more: The taxpayers had a right

And then the taxpayer's had no control over the crew­

5

6

men nor did they attempt to exercise it over the captains.

7

Petitioner has ignored these firylings, both in his brief and

8

his oral argument.
Q

H
12

should be the maritime standard and not the technical commonlaw standard; do you disagree with the conclusion of the Court
of Appeals that on thatpremise the case would go against you?
A

22

25

Q

Said that flatly; didn't they?

A

Yes, that if the maritime stardard were to be

applied then they said, "We would have to reverse the decision.''
Q

13
19

Well, the Court of Appeals did say that if the

maritime —

of general principles as opposed to some free-wheeling operation
by the administrative agency.
A

Isn't that the case really is?

Yes; I guess I would say that would be a fair

statement, Your Honor.

27

So, in, summary , the captains participated in bi­

3

lateral decisions and negotiations and fixed the price and they
exercised a high degree of independence in conducting their

4

operations; they exercised initiative in decision-making

what legal standard should

The principles of

The second point was: assuming that Petitioner's
contention that this involves a mixed question of law and fact,
would that circumstance call for a different result than that
reached by the concurring decisions below,
How, in the reply brief, if the Court please, there
was a new point raised andit poses this question: is proof of
filing an employment tax return and the payment of the tax a
defense against a suit for its refund?

Now, we didn’t get a

change to brief that for the Court because the reply brief was
served on us, I think, onlyThursday or Friday,
28

I want to

?

2

discuss that briefly here if I may.
At page four through six,, which is Point 3 of the

3

reply brief, the Petitioner says that because the respondents

4

filed employment taxes and paid the taxes and kept good records

3

the respondents thought or believed that the captains and crew­

6

men were their employees, and for that reason our suit for re­

7

8

Well, if the belief is to be a criterion of employ­

9

ment status it’s material only when one party believes that he

10

has the right to control and direct the activities of another;

11

and the other believes that he must submit to that control.

12

But I find it puzzling how filing a tax return can

13

come to that same arrangement.

legal concept when they are about to do it.
Now, suppose that respondents here had made their own
legal determination and decided that the fishermen were inde­
pendent contractors and decided not to pay the taxes; what
would have happened?

Well, of course, a number of things would

have happend, but experience in the fishing industry would show
this: that the tax collector would file liens on the boats;
attach whatever property at hand, including bank accounts;
literally tie up your business.
This happened in Enochs versus Williams Packing
Company, which came to this Court.

In that case it said;

"There in the circumstances of this case

can an intent to create an employer"employee relationship be
inferred from the fact without more that plaintiff, withheld from
and paid appropriate Federal taxes on the earnings of the
applicators »
"KLlure to hay© made such withholdings and payments

Then, too, plaintiff could not

have challenged the deficiency in tie tax court or had a reason­
able prospect of obtaining an injunction to restrain enforcement

One need not resort to Markendon to obtain a judicial

determination of the issue here.

'To suggest to plaintiff he

should not have paid the tax' if it

that the applicators

The ultimate benefits.

As a matter of fact,

18

Your Honor, there is one benefit I think the self-employed man

19

get that a common-law employee does not.

20

the 1964 self-employment pension act where lawyers are doing

21

it and I am sure that there are some fish captains who do it.

He can participate in

22

Now, this equality between the two categories is

23

demonstrated because the earnings credits of these people,

24

which determine their benefits? they are entitled to the same

2S

rate and dignity.

The Social Security Administration, the same

administration# dispenses benefits to both? the same tax
collector collects taxes from them both.

Now# the Petitioner's main thrust here is that the

3

common-law test should not be applied; that the rule governing
employment relationships under maritime law should foe decisive
in fixing the respondent's tax liabilities.
Now# if liability for these taxes is to be so-

than this Court# because it involves Federal fiscal policy

Treasury Department attempted to seek an amendment of this' act
to call these fishermen statutory employees.

But Congress took

no action on it.

that the Treasury Department felt that it was vulnerable to

Now, the Petitioner reasons that if a seaman is

entitled, to maintenance and cure from the owner he must be the

Now, I’ll accept

This Court said in

I see my time is about to expire, if the Court
please? but I want to say this;

That the fishermen in this

case, whom the Court, found did not meet the common-law test of
master and servant, are nonetheless entitled to maintenance and
cure by virtue of 'their marine employment.
Court said in Aguilar versus STandard Oil Company,
when this particular question came ups "Whether by traditional
standards a boat owner is or is not responsible for the
injuries, yet under maritime law he is nevertheless liable as
an incident of the marine employee-employer relationship."
We suggest that the main thrust of Petitioner’s
point there is without merit.

This conclusion is not contrary

to public policy, as Mr. Griswold has suggested.

It will not

frustrate the remedial aims of maintenance and cure or other
maritime runs.
There are many independent contractor relationships
which are workable under the Social Security Act and the

rulings of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue demonstrate

many bulletins that taxicab drivers are considered independent

contractors, although theydrive the cab in the company, the

company has great expenditures in promoting and keeping an

So, in conclusion wa ask that the Court consider that
the common-law test be applied and that if there is any other
