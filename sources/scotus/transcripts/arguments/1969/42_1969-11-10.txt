MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

O

MR. HAUDEK:

J

Mr. Haudek.

May it please the Court, this case is

4

here on certiorari to the Second Circuit, involves a stock­

5

holders derivative action.

6

are entitled to trial by jury.

The issue is whether the Petitioners

Petitioners, who are the plaintiffs below, made a

7

8

timely demand for a jury.

The Defense motion to strike the

9

jury demand was denied by the District Court.

The Second Circuit

by a two-to-one vote, reversed on the grounds that there can be

10

no right of jury trial in a stockholder suit.

11

And that holding

presents the principal issue here.

12

The holding below is in direct conflict with a

13

decision of the Sth Circuit.

14

It is also, we believe, in

conflict with an earlier decision of the Second Circuit, which

15

has been widely followed.

16

The facts of the case can be stated briefly:

17

Petitioners are stockholders of the defendant Lehman Corporation

18

a registered investment company.

19

They bring this action on

behalf of the corporation against its director and against the

20

broker, the defendant Lehman Brothers.

21

The Complaint charges that the directors of the cor­

22

poration, under the control of the broker, caused the corpora-

23

tion to pay unnecessary and excessive commissions to the broker.

24

These improper payments, it alleged, violated various provisions

25

il

2

1

of the Investment Company Act, and constituted conversion and

2

waste of corporate assets, willful or negligent breach of

3

fiduciary duties.

4

Q

Is this a Federal question of jurisdiction?

S

A

It is jurisdiction under the Investment Company

6

Act, Your Honor; Section 44.

7

Q

Mot a diversity case?

8

A

Not a diversity case»

9
10

I think the statement to

the contrary in the Opinion below is an error»
The Complaint demands judgment in favor of the

11

corporation for an accounting and for the damages of,the cor­

12

poration, as well as the profits of the Defendants.

The action thus falls into the traditional pattern
of the stockholders' derivative suit* the.cause .of action
belongs to the corporation b*at the corporation cannot bring
suit of it, because it is under the control of the wrongdoers»
A stockholder is, therefore, committed to bring the action on
behalf of the company.
The right of jury trial rests on the Seventh Amend­
ment to the Constitution, which declares that in suits of
common law the right of jury trial shall be preserved.
Before discussing' the strictly legal questions con­
cerning the scope of the Amendment, I want to say a word about
the fundamental importance of the issue.
From the earliest times to the present, this Court
3

1

has been emphatic that the right to a jury trial occupies a

2

crucial place in our legal system; so crucial, the Court has

3

said that any curtailment or seeming curtailment should be

4

scrutinized with the utmost care.
Q

5
6

We haven't thought of an injunction suit, for

example, or a mandamus as calling for a jury trial, have we?
A

7

No, Your Honor, a jury trial applies to legal

3

issues and we propose to show that these are legal issues.

9

course, the statement that your Court made was addressed to

10

legal issues.

junction, for instance.

23
24
25

And in that case there is your Court's

decision in Dairy Queen against Wood, which holds the legal
issues are decided first by a jury before the equitable issues
go to the Court.

20

22

Oh, no; there can be legal issues if a suit

for damages turns up at the same time as the suit for an in­

10

21

Do you suggest that there are never legal

issues in a suit for injunction or a suit for mandamus?

Q

I see.

Thank you.

A

Now, it is the great virtue of the jury system

to temper the technicalities of the law and the preconceptions
of judges by the common sense which controls laymen, can bring
to the practical prob.lems of life.

And this virtue, I believe,

has particularly appropriate place in the stockholder's
action.

4

1

2

Q

Isn't that also a function of equity to get

away from the rigidities of rules of law?

3

A

It is, Your Honor, but 1 think when we speak

4

of a jury we speak more of the factual issues rather than the

5

legal ones.

presented by the facts will be for the jury and that it is

7

there that their practical sense of justice can find applica­

Mow, the Court below in rejecting the jury right in

10
11

stockholder’s suits, simply argued that the stockholder’s actios

12

is not a suit at common law wi'din the meaning of the Seventh

13

Amendment.

14

suit was a creature of equity; it had to be brought in a Court

15

of Equity so that neither side had a right to jury trial and

16

still according to the Court below, this historical state of thf

17

law continues to date.

18

Historically, the Court says that a stockholder's

With deference I say that the Court below misconceive*

19

the nature of the derivative suit and the impact of the Federal

20

Rules of Jury Procedures.

The stockholder's derivative action

21

consists of two elements?

One is the cause of action of the

22
23
24
25

corporation; the other is the right

standing of the stock­

holder to assert that cause of action.
Unquestionably, the second element, the stockholder's
right to act for the corporation, was developed by the Courts

6

t

of Equity and is a creature of equity»

2

standing as champion of the corporation’s right presents,

3

therefore, an equitable issue which must be tried by the Court

4

without a jury.

5

The stockholder’s

hut the other element of the stockholder's action,

6

the underlying claim of the corporation is a wholly different

1

thing.

8

all? it may be a legal cause of action which, in an action by

9

the corporation, would entitle both parties to a jury trial.

This corporate claim is not the creature of equity at

10

Such a legal claim of the corporation, 1 submit, does not

11

change its nature because it is asserted on behalf of the cor­

12

poration, rather than by the corporation.
.

For instance, a corporate claim for conversion such

13

|

14

as is here alleged is typically and traditionally a claim

15

at law.,

16

still a claim for conversion; it is still based upon the legal ;

17

tort of conversion; it remains legal in origin and nature; and

18

such a legal claim, we submit is tryable by jury, no matter by

19

what mechanism the machinery of litigation is set in motion.

In a stockholder's suit it remains what it is; it is

In summary, it is our contention that in a stock­

20
21

holder's derivative action the equitable issues relating to a

22

stockholder's standing are tried by a Court but the legal

23

issues relating to the corporatioris claim are to be tried by. a

24

jury.

25

,
Q

Are you speaking now of the right to recover or
7

?

the amount of recovery when you speak of a jury?
A

2

Both, Your Honor.

But the — if the claim is

3

legal, of course the underlying claim might be an equitable

4

claim and then both elements would be equitable and you would

5

have no right to a jury trial.
But if the corporation's underlying claim is legal,

6

7

then both the existence of the claim and the

amount of the

S

claim, we say, must be determined by jury, if a proper demand

9

is made.
Now, this division of the trial functions between

10

Court and jury is a direct consequence of the merger of law and

Queen against Wood and its predecessor Beacon Theaters against
Westover.

In short, this Court held that if an action involved

both-legal and equitable issues, then the legal issues must be
decided by a jury while the equitable issues are passed on by
the Court.
Take for instance,the claim for trademark infringe­
ment which was involved in the Dairy Queen case where the
plaintiff asked both for an injunction and for damages.

For­

merly, prior to the merger of law and equity, such a suit had
to be brough on the equity side of the District Court and
equity wo®ld dispose wof the entire controversy without a jury.

8

1

Q

Including a claim for damages?

2

A

The claim for damages was disposed of by virtue

3

of the Cleanup Doctrine (?)
Q

4

But before the union of law and equity this —

5

particular suit was brought in IS20 — it. had been disposed or

6

as a suit in equity?
A

7
8

That9s right, Your Honor.

And that was the

innovation that was brought about by Dairy Queen.

9

Q

What was the innovation?

You mean that —

io

A

It is not brought in equity; it is not brought

it

at law; it is, of course, the singular form of action declared

12

by the Federal Rules and the Court sittingneither as a Court of

13

Equity, nor as a Court of Law, but simply as a Court.
Q

14

But, I take it that before — in the 1920's it

15

would have been held that this claim for damages was not a

IS

was an equitable issue and for which there would be no jury

n

trial,

is that right?

18

A

Well, I don't know whether the phrase in terms

19

of equitable issues --

20

Q

Well, how would you phrase it?

21

A

Wo, well, I think if it were

22

q

if it-were a legal claim whether it was 1920 or

23

any other time it wouldn't make any difference; there would have

24

been a jury trial.

25

A

In 1920, Your Honor, they would have tried the
9

1

whole thing in equity, not because the claim for damages was

2

not a legal claim, but because one's equity took jurisdiction?

3

it cleaned up the whole controversy»

I think it was the traditional view at that

Amendment?

and law jurisdiction — that equity could clean up legal claims,

right to jury trial is asserted in those years and the claim was

denied?

A

We mentioned one specifically, Your Honor,
{1
which involved a stockholder*s derivative action, where the
underlyingclaim of the corporation was legal and the right to
jury trial was asserted.

And I think it will be one of my

primary contentions, but insofar as a suit for injunction and
damages based on trademark violations is concerned, while I ait:
sure that there must have bean such cases, I am not presently
ready to cite one.
Q

At the present time, Mr. Haudek, if the bene­

ficiary of the trust asserts a claim against the trustees for
bad faith in the investment or management or payment of
excessive commissions, what kind of a. suit would that be?
A

I think, Your Honor, we are dealing with a

so-called "genuine trust,8' where a separation of legal title

10

I

and beneficial interest,, I believe that can be brought in

2

equity traditionally, because that comes under the traditional

3

head of equity jurisdiction,

q

There would be no jury trial?

There would be no jury trial in that case, bi.it

Q

Well, are you saying that the stockholders are

not the beneficial owners of the assets of the corporation,
subject only to creditors?
A

I think they have a beneficial interest, Your

12

■Honor, but I don’t think they are considered as trustees of an

13

express trust, in the sense in which I at least understood your

14

first question.

15

by the trustee or by last will where legal cattel is conferred

16

to person and the equitable interest to another.

17

;

1 was thinking of the technical trust created

Now, so far as the corporation and its officers are

18

concerned, the stockholders are concerned, I want to emphasise

19

that the directors certainly do not have legal title.

20

title may be vested in the corporation and the stockholders have

21

a beneficial interest in it, but the directors' position is

22

different from that of the technical trustees in that the

23

technical trustee has legal title; the director does not.

24

And I think that has always been the reason why Courts have

25

refused to apply technical trust rules to directors.
11

The

For

1

instance, the statute of limitations concerning express trusts

2

has always been quite different from the statute of limitations

3

applicable to directors.

5

Q

I gather the corporation claim derives only

from Section 44, doesn't it?

6

A

The jurisdiction.

1

Q

What about the claim?

8
9

Would there be a claim

in common law for this money recovery?
A

No, Your Honor; there is quite a number of

10

provisions of the Investment Company Act which I enumerated in

11

our Complaint.

12

willful conversion of assets of an investment company.

13

claim that there was willful conversion.

14

Q

For instance, Section 37 of the Act forbids
We

Well, what I am really trying to get at is

15

whether the Corporation's claim for money damages — would it

16

exist independently of the Investment Act?

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
23

A

It could also be an asserted point at common>/la.' ?.

Q

Well, would it have to be assertable at common

law in order to bring the Seventh Amendment into play?
A

No, Your Honor.

Q

It would not?

A

No.

Q

Any statutory violation would bring the Seventh

Amendment into play?
A

luiy statutory

12

violation, just as much as any

1

common-law violation if it creates a claim for damages,.

2

think generally the rule has been, as I understand it that even ■

3

4

I

a particular type of claim did not exist in 1791 so that you
cannot say whether in 1791 it was equitable or legal, you deal
i

5

with that by saying; "How would the Courts have dealt with

6

that claim in 179.1 if that type of situation had been known at

7

the time."

3
9
10

Q

Have any cases in this Court given this

A

I am quite confident — well, certainly in

analysis?

11

declaratory judgment cases this has been held to be so in

12

Beacon Theaters against Westover.

13

were unknown in 1791.

14

And declaratory judgments

And, incidentally, also in Beacon Theaters, Your

15

Honor, was involved a statutory claim for treble damages under

16

the anti-trust laws and the Court held that the right to jury

17

trial was constitutional.

18

And so I believe that answers it.

19

And so now, under the Doctrine of the Dairy Queen

20

case the Trial Court must scrutinize each issue, whether it is

21

essentially legal or equitable and since in Dairy Queen the

22

damage issue was of a legal nature it had to go to the jury as

23

this Court ruled, which the equitable issues relating to the

24

injunction were reserved for the Courts.

25

Norw, I submit that exactly the same principles apply

?

to stockholder^ derivative suits.

2

to the merger of law and equity* such an action was brought on

3

the equity side of the District Court and equity disposed of

4

the entire controversy»

5

Trial Court must now scrutinize each issue separately for its

0

legal or equitable character.

7

Again* in former days* prior

But again* under Dairy Queen* the

If the corporation's cause of action is essentially

8

legal it must be determined by the jury, even though other

S

issues, such as the standing of the stockholders are equitable

10

and kept for decision by the Court,

11

Now* it was held that the Court below refused to

12

apply the principle of Dairy Queen to stockholders3 suits.

13

Court below did assume* although it did not expressly hold

14

it assumed that the underlying corporate claim is legal* rather.

The

■S

15

than equitable in nature,and that it is this legal claim which

18

the Petitioners are seeking to enforce here.

17

The Court below held, however, that the stockholder's

18

action brings about a change in the nature of the causa of

19

action and converts it froia a legal to an equitable claim,

20
21

22
23
24
25

I

must say I fail to see by what argument the stockholder's suit
can bring about such a transformation of the claim.

After all*

as I have said* a corporate claim for conversion is a legal
claim and if it is asserted by a stockholder for the corporation, it is still based onthe same legal tort of conversion.
However, I need not pursue the logic of this

14

1

transformation theory of the Court below, -since this Court has

2

clesrly rejected it.

3

Street Lighting Company, decided in 1916»

4

wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court and since the case

5

strikes me as probably decisive here, 1 would like to dwell on

6

it briefly.

The case is Fleitman against Welsbach
Mr. Justice Holmes

Fleitman was a stockholder’s derivative action for

7
8

total

damages under the anti-trust laws.

This Court noted

9

that the cause of action belongs to the corporation and that

10

if the suit were brought by the corporation the claim would be

i!

at law and triable by jury.
Q

12

Would it not be — would that same thing not be

13

true if a broker had charged excessive commissions to a

14

trustee.

15

A

Yes, Your Holier,

16

Q

And the trustee brought the suit against the

17

broker; that would be at action at law?

te

A

Yes.

19

q

And a jury trial?

A

Yes,

Q

But you have previously indicated that if the

20
21

22

I'

sir.
A

beneficiaries of the trust brought that suit — made that claim
- y

23
24

against the trustees for having paid those excessive commissions,
]
that would necessarily be a suit in equity without a jury?
i

25

A

But,

YourHonor, these are two entirely
15

1

different things which I believe cannot be compared,

2

3

Q

1 just want you to clear up that lack of

parallelism which at least appears on the surface,

4

A

I think you would have the parallelism, Your

5

Honor, if your express trustee had paid excessive commissions

6

to the broker and if he refused to bring an action against the

7

broker.

8

so to say, derivatively, on behalf of the trust and that action

9

would be just as much triable by jury as an action brought by

10

Then I assume the beneficiary could bring the action

2

talking about now has been able to maintain an action in his

A

4

The beneficiary of a trust,- no, Your Honor, we

5

have not, but I could refer you to a case in which the stock­

6

holder's action was, indeed compared to certain aetioxis by a

7

beneficiary.

8

Circuit.

9

It is Goldstein against Grosbeak in the Second
/

I think the late Judge Charles E. Clark said that

10

a stockholder's derivative action is essentially the same as

11

or similar to an action by the beneficiary of a trust because

12

the trustee himself refuges to enforce the cause of action.

13

This case is not cited in our brief.

14
15

Q

You referred to a case a moment ago — did you

say Blackman?

16

A

Fleitman, Your Honor; F-l-e-i-t-m-a-n.

17

In the Fleitman case the issue before the Court, as

18

the Court stated it, was whether the defendant'B right to a

19

jury trial should be forfeited because the complaining stock­

20

holder was unable to induce action by the corporation and in­

21

stead brought the action on behalf of the corporation.

22
23
24
25

Now, this Court held in Fleitman that the answer to
the question was "no."

Now, in other words, the derivative

suit did not change the nature of the cause of action that was
alleged in the Fleitman case.

17

The cause of action remains a

1

legal claim under the anti-trust laws and the parties were

2

entitled to jury trial»

3

Now, I say that this part of the Fleitman case —

4

I will presently refer to another — that this part of the

5

Fleitman case is directly applicable here»

6

Fleitman, the underlying cause of action is at law»

7

Although 1 think a while ago you conceded that

at the time of Fleitman another kind of stockholder’s deriva­

11

20

Q

Of course, do the anti-trust laws provide for
i

21

22

a jury trial?
A

No, Honor, the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act

23

are completely silent and I want to repeat, since the Court

24

below seemed to think that the jury rights under the anti-trust

25

laws is statutory —

1.8

1

Q

1 thought so, too.,

2

A

Fleitman did hint at it hut we cannot tell for

sure what the Court thought,,

case and the Beacon Theaters case, why, this Court held that

5

the right of action for treble damages is under the constitu­

6

tion — the right to a jury is under the constitution.

7

But, certainly in the Westover

Now, I must add that Fleitman in another part which

8

I think is no longer applicable, the action was decided in the

9

days when law and equity were separate.

The action had been

10

brought on the equity Side of the Court and the Equity Courts

11

in those days, could not administer a jury trial.
*

12

This case was an impasse that on the one hand, the

13

parties were entitled to a jury trial and on the other hand,

15

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

\
the Court could not grant it so the Courts saw no other way out
but to dismiss the action .in its entirety.
This extreme consequence, would, of course, no longer
be applicable todayj with the merger of law and equity, the same
Court and the same trial can now submit the legal issues to a
\
jury while the equitable issues remain with the Courts. A
stockholder's action can no longer be dismissed because it
asserts the legal cause of action that's triable to a jury.
the contrary, the jury right which was recognised in Fleitman
can now be given its full scope and effect.

And X think that

There is a second issue which the Respondents have

the Court:

S

was well put by my brother Haudek on oral argument and in his

7

brief.
I think the controlling consideration, in his words,

3
9

I think the decisive- consideration in this case wa

is that a stockholder's derivative suit is a creature of

10

equity.

That being so, I think it necessarily follows that

11

there is no right to trial by jury under either the Seventh

12

Amendment o.f Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
This Court has said on a number of occasions that

13
14

the controlling test under the Seventh Amendment is the test of

15

history.

16

jury in sueh a case at the time of the enactment of the Seventh

17

Amendment in 1791?

Put in other words: was there a right to trial by

i

18

Or, put another way, under Rule 38:

19

right to trial’ by jury which Rule 38, by its own terms,

20

preserved inviolate?

21

Was there a

I think the answer to that question, is historially

22

determinable and is clear.

It is clear that a derivative suit

23

is and always has been a creature of equity so that no right to

24

trial by jury existed whichthe Seventh Amendment or Rule 38

25

could preserve.
20

1

With only two exceptions that our research has led

2

us to, De Pinto in the Ninth Circuit ant"the decision of the

3

District Court's judgment claim in this case.

4

decision in any Federal Court anywhere which has ever intimated

5

that a stockholder's derivative suit was triable otherwise than

6

in the Court as an equitable claim.

We know of no

7

So far as we knew, in the Southern District.of New

8

York, which I believe probably tries more suits of this kind

9

than any other Federal District,

10

stockholder5s derivative

suit, has ever been tried by a jury.
As the authorities cited in our brief indicated

11

i

12

I hesitate to use the terra, but the overwhelming weight of

13

authority? indeed, unanimous weight of authority with the

14

exception of De Pinto and the District Court here, has been,

15

in Mr. Haudek’s word§- that the derivative is a creature of

16

equity, and therefore conferred no jury right which the Seventh

t

’’

17
18

i

Amendment could preserve.
Now, as I understand my friend's argument, it is that

19

history must be reread or rewritten because of what, I submit,

20

is a misreading of this Court's Opinions in Beacon ad Dairy.

21

The misleading begins with the premise that, a derivative suit

22

is, in essence, a combination of two claims? an equitable claim

23

against the directors of the corporation for unlawful refusal

24

to assert a corporate claim and secondly, the claim — what is

25

called the underlying claim on behalf of the corporation.
21

1

Beginning with that premise, Petitioner analyzes

2

Beacon in the terms that where legal and equitable issues are

3

joined within the same lawsuit, the Court may not, by first

4

trying the equitable issue, frustrate the adversary's right to

5

a jury trial*

6

7

That reasoning, 1 submit, is wholly inapplicable
here.

3

Q

9

A

10

Q

Do you think the premise is wrong?
The premise —

i

11

The premise -** what you referred to as the

premise, that there are, in effect, two lawsuits.
A

12

Yes, sir.

In the stockholder's derivative

13

suit, Your Honor, I Submit there are not two lawsuits.

Because,

14

what my friend calls the first claim? the claim predicated upon

15

the refusal of the corporation's officers and directors to

IS

assert the corporate claim, I say is inseparable and indivisible

17

from fee claim asserted on behalf of the corporation.
Unlike the situation, for example, in Beacon, where

18
19

the claim was that the defendants had threatened anti-trust

20

litigation against the Plaintiffs; had threatened to sue cus-~

21

tomers, and where the plaintiff brought an action, not only for
r

22

a suit for injunction, — against such threats, but also

23

brought a legal claim for a determination under the Declaratory

24

Judgment Act of whether the plaintiffs5 conduct violated the

25

anti-trust laws.

Unlike that situation, where it was the
22

?

Plaintiff's option to state those claims separately or to­

2

gether.

3

It is an essential predicate of any derivative suit

In a derivative suit they cannot he separated out.

4

Q

What is the object of a derivative suit?

5

A

The object of the dez:ivati\^e suit, Mr. Justice

6

Blacky is to assert a claim ordinarily against those who con­

7

trol the corporation,, which the corporate entity has,, itself,

8

refused to assert.
Q

S
10

Would that have anything to do here with a

governing law when you try the case for damages?
A

11

Governing law in the sens® of whether it's

i
12

state or Federal?
Q

13

No; the law that governs the trial for damages.

i

14

Is that controlled at all by the law -— by the principles that

35

give a right to recover — make the corporation bring the suit?
A

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

question.

I think not, Your Honor, if I understand your
Our position is that once the claim is acknowledged

to be derivative in nature — that is that the plaintiff pur­
ports to assert a claim which is not his own, but a claim of
another — a corporation in which he claims to own stock —that that fact and that fact alone makes the action one which
is cognizable historically in equity and only in equity and
regardless of thfe nature of 'the claim asserted on behalf of
the corporation, the Seventh Amendment preserved no right which
existed before.

23

I point also, Mr. Justice Black, to Old Equity Rule

1
2

27.

In the 1880*3 this Court, after Hawes against Oakland,

3

promulgated a rule to limit what it considered to be abuses in

4

stockholder's derivative suits.

5

Equity Rules since 1881 and it's perfectly clear from that

6

rule that stockholder’s derivative suits could only be brought

7

on the equity side of the Federal District Courts.

That rule appeared in the

\

That rule was lifted almost bodily into the Federal

8

Rules in 1938 as Rule 23.

So, this Court, itself, recognised,

What is it the man's after that files a derivative

suit?
A

Well, in this case, or the case of the

complaint, the man is after money.
Q

Yes; but what is the basic claim he has; what

does he have to prove to establish his right to go along with a
derivative suit?
A

He has to prove inthis case, Your Honor, two
24

1

things: first ha has to prove a wrongful refusal —

2

Q

By corporation to sue?

3

A

By corporation to sue and then he must prove,

4

in his words, "gross breach of fiduciary duty" on the part of

5

those who control the corporation, with the effect that they

6

profited unlawfully and should disgorge their profits to the

7

corporation.
Q

8
S

That is what he must do.
And are either one of those issues relevant in

the main action that he wants to get to trial for damages?
A

10

I think none of them is relevant — only one is

11

relevant to the issue of whether he is entitled to a trial by

12

jury»
Q

13

14

I'm not talking about a jury; I'm talking about

whether he's entitled to damages.
A

13

Well, if he fails to prove unlawful refusal by

16

the corporation to bring the suit, the suit terminates at that

17

point.

18

Wo matter whether or not —

19

He must surmount that hurdle in order to stay in court.

G

~ and if he has proven that, he hasn't proven

20

anything in connection with the ultimate suit he wants to file

for damages, has he?

A

It8s not true practically. Your Honor, because

2

of Rule 23, which as 1 said before, fits verbatim Old Equity

3

Rule 27c

4

that he has made demand upon the corporation and that it has

5

refused to accede to that demand, or it must allege an excuse

6

for its failure to do so.

That rule requires that a plaintiff either allege

7

If Your Honor will turn to the Complaint in this

S

case, which is in the Appendix, he will find that in order to

9

comply with that provision of the rule, the plaintiff alleges on

to

Page 27 of the Complaint, that, the demand to bring suit here

11

would be futile because the directors are the wrongdoers?

12

because the corporation is in hostile hands and so on.

13

I can say from my experience that I have never seen a

14

complaint in a derivative case which does not contain such an

15

allegation in order to comply with Rule 23<.

16

Well, it seems entirely separate and distinct

One of the issues here is .that,© corporation won’t

file a suit by reason of fraud or something else.

The other

issue is: if the corporation does or it had filed the suit
it can recover damages.

It seems to me like they are entirely

separate and distinct.
A

Your Honor, if they were separate and distinct,

then I submit, as Year Honor pointed out in Beacon, derivative
suits could not have been maintained in the Federal Courts
prior to 1938.
Q

Well, this was not prior to 1938.

A

Well, Your Honor, prior to 1938 separate, equal

and' equitable claims could not be joined in a 'single case.

14

Q

But they can now? can’t they?

15

A

They can now, but doesn’t it demonstrate the

16

fact that derivative suits were maintained in Federal Court

17

before 1938; that the two aspects are not separate, because if

18

•they were separate then there could not have been a derivative

19

suit in the Federal Court.

20

My point, may it please the Court --

21

Q

Has that issue that you were just saying, ever

22

been dealt with here, that a derivative suit — in some case

23

prior to 1938 in this Court said that, a derivative suit may

24

involve a claim for damages and the trial without a jury?

in a

different context.

7

Q

It was a derivative action, wasn1t it?

8

A

It was a derivative action and Mr. Justice

9

Holmes had before him the problem of whether there could be

10

such an animal — if I may use those terras — as a derivative

11

treble damage claim.

12

that the right to trial by jury was an essential ingredient of

13

the scheme of enforcement which Congress had created and that,

14

essential ingredient could not be satisfied on the equity side

And he approached that problem by saying

15

of the Court, ergo, no derivative treble damage claims,

16

the only case which raises that point in this Court.
But the point I was trying to make is that the two

17
18

It*s

aspects could not be deemed separable, because if they had been

19

separable, there could have been no Equity Rule 27 and there
V

20

could have been .no derivative jurisdiction in the Federal

Courts at that time.
