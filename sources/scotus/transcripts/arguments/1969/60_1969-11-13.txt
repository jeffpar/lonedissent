ORAL ARGUMENT BY FRANK C. JONES, ESQ. (Continued)
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

6

MR. JONES:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

Thank you, sir.

3

Before attempting to reply in detail to the arguments of

9

Counsel for the Petitioners and the Assistant Solicitor General

10

I'd like to address myself briefly for the record? particularly

11

because when this case was here before, there wa,s no factual

12

record before the Court.

13

It seems to us-, first of all, that the exact language

14

6f our Item 9 of Senator Bacon's will is of great importance

15

to every question which is presented in this litigation.

16

first directing that this property — something over 100 acres

17

originally — be held in trust for the benefit of his wife and

18

daughter during their lifetime, Senator Bacon then provided

19

following the death of the last of them for the creation of

20

this charitable trust, using the following language and with

21

the Court's indulgence, I quote:

22

After

"in trust for the sole,) perpetual and unending use,

23

benefit and enjoyment of the white women, white girls, white

24

boys and white children of the City of Macon, to be by them

25

forever used and enjoyed as a park and pleasure ground, subject
3

I

to &he restrictions, government, management,, rules and control

2

of the Board of Managers herinafter provided for? the said

3

property under no circumstances, or by any authority whatso­

4

ever, or at any time for any reason devoted to any other pur­

5

pose or use excepting so far as herein specifically authorized. *

6

He further stated: "I take the occasion to say that

7

in limiting the use and enjoyment of the property perpetually

8

to white people, I am not influenced by any unkindness of

9

feeling or want of consideration for the Nigras. or colored

10

people.

11

in their social relations the two racas, white and Nigra should

12

be forever separate and that they should not have pleasure or

13

recreation grounds to be used or enjoyed, together and in

14

common. "

15

I am, however, without hesitation in the opinion that,

I
And finally, in explaining the motivation for this

16

bequest, Senator Bacon stated first of all that it was in

17

appreciation for the citizens of Macon for the public honor

18

that had been bestowed upon him, but especially it was a memor­

19

ial to his two deceased sons.

20

at the sam& time, link their memories with the pleasures and

21

enjoyments of the women and children and girls and boys of

22

their own race in the community in which they once formed a

23
24
25

i

Using the language, I should,

I

happy part.
Now, we submit that Senator Bacon's purpose and in­
tent was stated as clearly as possible in the’English language.

4

!

There are no conflicts or inconsistencies in his language»

2

spelled out one purpose and one purpose only , and that was the

3

operation of a park on a racially-restricted basis for the sole

4

and. exclusive benefit of the white citizens or segment of them,

5

of the City of Macon„ .

6
7

8
9

Q

What was the provision in the will as it

respects the use of the park by white adults?
A

It was provided, Your Honor, that with the

permission of the Board of Managers, which I will speak about

10

in just a moment, that white men of the community would foe

n

permitted to use the park.

12

the discretion of the Board of Managers.

13
14
15

He

Q

That was a discretionary use in

Dees the record show how that provision was

administered?
A

Yes, sir, I think a fair statement in the record

16

states that white men were permitted over the years to use the

17

park freely without restriction.

18

It seems to us that the argument that there were two

19

purposes, a permanent park on the one hand and a park ->nly for

20

white persons only on the other, simply cannot foe supported by

21

any fair reading of the language of the will itself.

22
23
24
25

Next, l“d like to direct the attention of the Court
briefly to the matter of the city control (of the park.

It seems

to us that opposing counsel have attempted to create the im­
pression that the City of Macon somehow wound up with what
5

<

1

amounted to fee simple ownership of this property,,

We say the

2

record not only fails to support this conclusion, but clearly

3

shows the contrary was true»

4

To begin with, although Senator Bacon in the will

5

named the City of Maeon as the trustee and authorised it to

6

appoint the first Board of Managers, he gave the city no

7

power whatever with respect to the operation of the paris»

8

Instead he provided that the seven-member Board of Managers,

9

which would be a self-perpetuating body, subject only to the

10

right of the City to confirm any successor appointment to that

11

Board.

12

control and management of the said property, with power to
;a\

“Shall at all times have complete and unrestricted

.

' '

'

13

make all meaningful regulations for the preservation and im­

14

provement of the same and rule to the use and enjoyment thereof;!

15

with power to exclude at any time any person or persons of

16

either sex who may be deemed objectionable or whose conduct or

17

IS
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

character may by said Board be adjudged or considered objectionable? for such is to render for any reason in the judgment of
said board, their presence in said grounds inconsistent with
or prejudicial to the proper and most successful use and enjoy­
ment of the same, for the purposes herein contemplated."
Again, it seems to us, by the clearest possible
language Senator Bacon vested total control of the operation of
the park, not on the City of Macon, but in this independent
group of private citisens.

He authorised the Board furthermore,

6

.

1

2
3
4
5

to use a portion of the property lying to the east of the
street now known as North Avenue, "in any manner they may deem
best," for producing income to defray expenses connected with
the operation, management and preservation of the property."
And in various other ways gave it total and absolute control
The Board of Managers was not made answerable in any

6
7
8

way to the City and the City had no authority to remove any
member of the board or otherwise exercise supervision over it
in any way.

9
The record further shews that the Board of Managers

10

11
12

13
14

i

|

did, in fact, exercise completeImanageraent and control exactly j
'
as contemplated by Senator Bacon.

The record includes detailed

minutes of many meetings of the board over a period of 30 years
in which the most minute matters were carefully considered
and. decided.

15
The record shows the City did nothing without the

16

authorisation and approval of the board.

The City's conduct

17
and interest in Baconsfield was at all times completely con­

18
sistant with, its limited status as holder of the naked legal

19
title.

At no time did the City treat the property as being

20

"Public property," as has been referred to in the brief of
21
opposing counsel.

22
The City did not treat this property in the same way
no

iQ

at all that the City treated the 40 or 50 other city parks

24
which were owned in fee simple by the City.

j
1 think an

1

excellent, example of this is the way in which the swimming

2

pool that's been referred to in this case before, was handled.

3

The land on which this pool was constructed was not

4

in the park proper, but in the income-producdng area lying to

5

the east of what is now known as North Avenue,

6

constructed in 1948? it was constructed on property that was

7

leased bv the Board of Managers to the City of Macon.

8

of the lease is in the record.

9

demonstrates that it is a standard lease similar to the other

And it was

17

1 think it is self-evident that if the City of Macon

18

had ever at any time regarded this as being public property in

19

the sense in which that expression has been used in the brief

20

of opposing counsel, there would never have been any such lease

21

arrangement as was worked out with respect to the swimming pool.

22

Counsel have suggested in this case that there is

23

some significance of a special nature to the 1920 deed that's

24

been referred to.

25

brief that that had absolutely no effect upon the nature of the

I think as we pointed out completely incur

8

1

interest of the City.

2

the charitable trust would not come into being until after the

3

death of the survival of Senator Bacon8s widow and two children,

4

and the sole purpose, as the record clearly shows of the 1920

5

deed was to make it possible for the vesting of possession in

6

the City as trustee» to commence in 1920, rather than being

1

postponed until the death of the survival of those three mem­

8

bers of Senator Bacon’s family.

It was provided, as I pointed out, that

kind before the Court.

the extent of the city involvement at that time.

13

the assumption is recorded in the Majority Opinion that it was

14

there was a continuation of city involvement in the operation

15

of the park.

There was nothing specifically to show
4

Consequently

The record now before the Court is a fully-developed

16
17

record.

18

1964 when the City of Macon resigned as trustee and its resig­

19

nation was accepted by the trial court the city has had no

20

involvement of any kind or character with Baconsfield Park.

21

No funds have been provided; no city employees have assisted in

22

maintenance or preservation; there has been absolutely nothing

23

in the way of involvement or connection by the city of Macon

24

with the operation ormaintenance of this park.

-

25

It shows clearly and without contradiction that since

The Board off Managers# since 1964 has provided all of
9

?

the funds for the operatiori and maintenance of the park, using

2

the income produced from the leasers of property in the income-

3

producing area for that purpose.
In 1968 to complete the record on that point

4
3

receivers were appointed by the Trial Court and are continuing

3

to operate the park just as the Board of Managers had done

7

prior to that time, pending -the final outcome of this litigatio^.

8

Q

How many acres of land in this park?

9

A

Your Honor, we now estimate it is about 50 to

•ID

1!

60 acres.

A substantial portion of the acreage was taken by a

condemnation

for an interstate highway.

That 50 to 60 acres

12

we believe, includes not only the park proper, but also the

13

incoma-producing area of soma five to ten acres lying to the

14

east of North Avenue.

Who got the money for the condemnation —

condemned prop-arty?
A

That money was received by the Board of Managers

and is presently being held by the receiver as appointed by the
Trial Court, pending the disposition of this litigation.
Q

You say the City has never treated this property

as public property?

A

Yes, sir.

Q

Did it treat it as public property in dealing

with the United States?
A

Your Honor, that is perhaps the sole exception

10

1

to the statement that I made»

£

and Mr. Claiborne have pointed out, that certain representations

3

were made in documents furnished by the City of Macon in

connection with the WPA financing.

5

the circumstances surrounding it, the record is silent.

6

is nothing 1st. the record to show that the Board of Managers in

7

any way authorized or consented to those representations by the

8

City.

9

It is correct, as Mr. Nabrit

As to why that happened or
There

And save, and except that sole dealing with the

10

Federal Government, I know of no instance inthis record in

11

which the City has treated this as public property.

12

as far as the relations between the city and the Board of

13

Managers is concerned, every action of the City has been"consist

14

with its limited status as trustee and with the recognition of

15

the park by the Board of Managers.

16

17

Q

But they have been in charge of the improvements

placed on this property, haven't they?

18
19

Certainly,

A

Mo, sir.

Tha Board of Managers has been in

charge of the improvements.

It is correct, as the record shows,
i

20

that city employees had assisted in the operation and preserva­

21

tion of the park and city funds, obviously, to that extent were

22

involved.

23

At the same time, the Board of Managers, as X was

24

about to point out in connection with pre-1964 involvement, have

25

utilized perhaps $100,000 or a figure right in the neighborhood
'i

i

1

of money made available upon the income-producing property

2

also for the preservation and maintenance of the park.

3
4

Q

Well, what proportion of the maintenance costs

were paid by city funds?

S

A

Mr. Justice Brennan, that's very difficult to

6

determine precisely from the record, but I was about to make

7

the statement that it appears that at least 50 percent of the

8

total cost of tha operation and maintenance found its source

9

under income produced from the income-producing property left

10

by Senator Bacon.

n

total cost of operation and maintenance is attributable to city

12

funds, directly or indirectly.

And that perhaps 50 percent or less of the

The record as complete as it is, is simply impossible

!3

U

mathematically to determine the exact percentage of support

15

from the city and the Board of Managers.
In our view the evidence as to pre-1964 involvement

16
17

by the City is largely immaterial to the issues that were

18

presented in the present posture of this case.

19

these facts solely because in our judgment, with due respect to

20

opposing counsel, they greatly overemphasised the nature and
of
extent/that involvement.

21

Now, I mention

It is true, as I alreadypointed out, that WPA funds

22
23

were .made available in 1935 in connection with the development

24

of the park* and city labor was made available thereafter for

25

a period of perhaps 30■ years in connection with the operation of.

i

12

1

the park.

2

record shows that this property consists largely of grass and

3

shrubbery and trees.

4

50 percent is in trees.

5

property, other than in the income-producing area to the east

6

of North Avenue, is the clubhouse that has been referred to by

7

counsel in the argument yesterday.

Well over 50 percent of it, or at least
The only structure of any kind on the

As I mentioned just a moment ago, during this same

8
9

But I will ask the Court to keep in mind, as the

period perhaps $100,000 of income attributable to Senator

'10

Bacon's own request, has also been used in the operation and

11

maintenance of the park.

12

,

.

.. We would also direct the Court8© attention to the

fact that the record shows that in 1920 when the early vesting
of possession in the city was agreed upon.

At that same time

$13,000 in bonds and interest that had been left by Senator
Bacon for this purpose, were turned over to the city.

And the

city agreed to make a 5 percent annual payment on that $.13,000
or $650.

I think this is of significance in the whole picture.

£ would calculate that the amount of the principal and interest of the bonds that were turned over to the city in 1920,
plus the five parcent payments it was obligated to make would,
over the years, have amounted to about $43,000.
So that to that extent, that part of the city involve­
ment is attributable directly to funds left by Sanator Bacon
himself for use in connection r-5th the development of the
C"

13

1

propertyThat, in addition to the about $100,000 that came

2

from fee income on the income-producing property to the east.,

3

Finally, with respect to that evidence, again I make

4

the statement that the record never shows in any way that the

5

city sought to exercise control in its dealing with the Board

of Managers»

**?

dealings, which is highly consistent with its limited status

8

as holder only of the naked legal title9 recognising complete

9

control in the Board of Managers.

10

But instead, everything that it did in those

IS

possible for Senator Bacon's trust to be carried out in accord­

19

20

Shortly

This being based upon the

It was further pointed out in the Supreme Court that

21

the resulting trust under a Georgia statute was implied for the

2£

benefit of the heirs of the testator.

23

24
25

Incidentally, I have checked on that statute since
yesterday and I have found that it's been in the Georgia law
at least since the Code of 1863 which wag the earliest available
14

1

2
3
4

5
6

cod® for my inspection.

So far as I know, it's purely declara­

tory to the common law and has been in the Georgia Coda since
the first code was declared.
This case was amended by the Supreme Court of Georgia
to the Trial court for determination as to

1*0

were the heirs

of Senator Bacon.
In the third and final appearance of this case before

7
8
9
10

the State Supreme Court in December 1968, the decision with
respect to which the writ was granted, the Supreme Court re­
iterated Its holding with the trust it terminated from the
state law, noting that Petitioners had sought no review of that

11
12

holding by this Court.
It held further that the cy pres doctrine could not

13
be applied under- Georgia law and rejected various other conten­
14
tions of Petitioners, including all of those urged before the
15
16

the Covxt yesterday and today.
It held that, in short, applying state law, a trust

17
created under a Georgia will and relating to Georgia property
18
had failed.

hnd„ again under state law, the property had

19

reverted tofche heirs of the testator.
20
Q

I5d like to ask you a question, Mr. Jones.

21

Perhaps the Petitioner will also answer it.

Is there any con­

22
tention in this case that in dealing with the cy pres statute
23
the Georgia cy pres statute, the Georgia Court departed from

24
the course of its decisions and that doctrine developed under

25
15

1

Georgia law?

2

In other words, is there any contention in this case

3

that there has been a discriminatory application of the cy pres

4

statute by the Georgia Court down there?
Your Hor r, as I understand their position, they claim

5
6

only it is discriminatory in its effect»

7

Q

Yes, but that's not ray question.

8

A

1 do not understand their contention to be that

9
10

there has keen any discriminatory application of the doctrina
itself.
Q

11

More concretely, if one looked at all of the

12

Georgia cy pres petitions could you discern in those decisions

13

something that indicates a different result than has bean

14

reached in this instance?

i

A

15

Absolutely not.

Your Honor, I

think, as we

16

have developed fully in our brief, the holding of the Georgia

'17

Supreme Court with respect to cy pras is completely consistent

18

with the body of law that's been developed in the state.

IS

the State

20

read the decision and as I understand,what they did, totally

21

22

without regard to the racial limitation being a feature in this
a
instance. It was simply an application of stats law to/will

23

drawn by a Georgia testator.

24
25

And

Supreme Court applied the cy pres doctrine, as we

15

IS

Clearly, just

limited to whites but that's only the beginning of the question
— the argument.
MR. JONES:

Yes, I could answer that in two ways:

first of all, the Supreme Court of Georgia construed the will,
particularly the language which I quoted at the outset of my
argument as saying that not just a purpose, but the sole and
exclusive purpose of the will was to provide for —
Q

I would suggest, then, that there are a lot of

wills in gifts o£ tuberculosis hospitals and they have said the jso
17
13
19

20
21

22
23
2-4
25

purpose was so and so, and they have been cy presed.
A

Your Honor,—-

Q

Well, go ahead.

They said the sole purpose and

therefore what?
A

They Said the sole purpose was the operation

of the park for white citizens on a racially-resteicted basis
and furthermore, that under Georgia law, which 1 think is also
general law, but at least the state law, that the cy pres

17

j

1

doctrine can never be applied in a way to defeat the intention

2

of the will.

3
4

Q

Yes, yes? bat you say that the cy pres doctrine

in Georgia has never been, applied to cy pres into a different
.

5

use in a situation where the testator said for a sole use? a

6

sole use — now, is that the end of the argument?

7

A

Your Honor, I don't think that the Georgia

8

Supreme Court decision was based simply on the language of the

9

sole purpose.
•

-

10

Q

Well, then, go ahead? what else?

11

A

In addition to saying the sola purpose, it was

12

then the spelling out of Senator Bacon's personal social

philosophy, that he was fundamentally opposed to the mixing of

the races, and finally, the underscoring of this entire motiva­

tion with reference to his two deceased sons and the use and

enjoyment of members of their race only of this park.

Wo, sir; I don't think that's the approach,

Q

Then you aren't talking about his intention,

A
Justice White»

I think it divides into two branches, Mr»

;

First of all, 1 think that the inquiry of the

State Supreme Court was " what was the purpose of the trust
as expressed by the creator himself?"
And secondly, having ascertained what that purpose

18

19

What would he have done if he had known that a

are. you?

14
15

Well, I know, but what question are they

restricted park was unconstitutional?

11

13

Under the state law, Your Honor, by listening

was, could cy pres be applied?

They concluded, first of all,
i

that the sole purpose was, as I have stated, and secondly,
that under the Georgia Cy Pres Statute, Cy pres applies only,

I

first of all, where there is a general charitable intent and
where simply is stated the mode of carrying that intent into
effect.

And secondly, cy pres has never applied where it would!
1

defeat the purpose of the intention of the testator.
19

Q

1

2
3

4

Well, I would suggest that in Georgia the cy

pres is applied all the time to defeat the purpose of the
trust, because you suddenly find a trust serving a different
purpose that it was; don't you?
A

5

I don't believe — obviously I can't speak with

6

authority with respect to the cy pres law of any other state,

7

but I don't interpret the holding of the State Supreme Court

8

as being what you just suggested —
Q

3

10

Any time it is suggested that a trust serve a

different purpose than it did and the suggestion is refused.
.

A

n
12

No, sir; I suppose, in all candor, it would be

a question©f degree.

That if there is a slight inability to

carry out the terms of the trust, that would be one matter.

{

u

2!
22
23

But, the Georgia Supreme Court felt that from the language that
was used there precisely and fully by Senator Bacon, that there
simply was a total failure of carrying out his thoughts because
of the decision of this Court in Evans versus Newton.

it was impossible to operate a racially-restricted park, and that
that was the sole and exclusive purpose of the creator of the
trust.
.

I don’t think they at all directed the inquiry as to
what Senator Bacon's thoughts may have been 50 years later if ha
had been aware of tfye change of social philcsphy and the change
of the legal rulings, as well.

24
25

That is,

Q

May I ask you one question about -— -

20

i

A

Yes, sir.

2

Q

— judgment that the Supreme Court of Georgia

V

rendered after the case went back — the first judgment.

Did

J

4

you say that those who are contesting this now did not appear

;

5

in that case?

6
7

A

Ho, sir? they did appear in that case.

They

have appeared on both cases and since the case went back from
I

a

this Court.

9

Q

And what position did they take in that case?

10

A

Your Honor, there was no oral argument before

11

the Court and briefs were submitted or memoranda ware submitted

12

by the parties in response to a request from the Supreme Court

13

of Georgia.

14

that was taken by Counsel for Petitioners at that time.

IS

haps Mr. Nabrit can respond to that.

16
17

Q

I'm a little uncertain as to the exact position
Per­

I assume that wouldn't change the — to the

legal questions —

18

A

No, sir? not in the slightest, to my judgment.

19

Dealing with the questions one by one, very briefly: |

!

20

we submit, 'first of all that, all of the Petitioners in this

21

case ignore the distinction that must be made between the

22

Federal question of the manner in which the park will have to

23

be operated if it continued in existence as a park.

24

state law questions involving the construction of Senator

25

Bacon's will*

And the

As we see it, the Federal interest of Petitioners
21

is simply that if Baconsfield were continued in operation as
2

a park, it would have to be operated on a noh--discriminatory

3

basis by whoever serves as trustee, in obedience to Evans

4
5

versus Newton.
There is no basis in Evans versus Newton, as we read

6

it, on the other hand, or any other decision of this Court,

7

where Petitioner’s argument that there is an additional Federal

8

requirement that the State Courts must construe Senator Bacon*s

9

will in a manner that will result in Baconsfield continuing as

10

a park, when such a construction would be very? likely contrary

11

to the clear expression of the testator himself.

12

j

As we understand the prior decisions of this Court

13

the construction of a will and determination of amount of

14

reversion are state law questions to be examined by State Courts:.

15

It was pointed out by Mr. Justice Black in the

16

dissenting opinion in Evans versus Newton, "so far as X have

17

been able to find, the power of the state to decide such a

18

question, that of diversion has been taken for granted in every

19

prior opinion this Court has ever written touching the subject.'

It never

It was left in trust for the ex™

elusive benefit of a limited class of persons.

The racial

limitation was the product exclusively of Senator Bacon’s
social philosophy and not that of the city or state.
22

j

As we see it when this case was amended to the

I
2

Supreme Court of Georgia by this Court in Evans versus Newton,

3

the Supreme Court had before it two facts that were controlling

4

upon it.
First of all, this Court had held that BaconsfieId

5
6

could not be operated in accordance with the racial restrictions

7

contained in Senator Bacon's will by anyone as trustee.

8

And secondly, the will itself is clear that he wanted|

3

a park operated only in accordance with the racial restrictions|

10

and not otherwise,

11

interpretation of the will by the Supreme Court of Georgia.

12

13
14

That was further found as a matter of

Q

Is there any dispute on that — as to that
'

A

No, sir; I understood Mr. Nabrit to say to the

<
position?

15

Court yesterday that he conceded that the sole purpose of

16

Senator Bacon was the. operation of the park on a racially

17
18

restricted basis; that he had sought to develop a thesis that
/
two purposes can be found: one, a permanent park and secondly,

19

a racially-restricted park.

20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

Oh, but isn't his argument that certainly his

:

purpose was tohave a park for whites, and you can still have a j
park for whites and that the revision defeats the purpose to

i
2

have a park for whites.
i

!
A

Your Honor, I understand his argument to be

that, yes, but based on the —

a park for Negroes .and whites t&go&hSE?
A

7

No, sir; if 1 .may respectfully disagree, the

8

Supreme Court of Georgia and we interprete the will not as

9

saying two things, but as saying one thing, and that iss the

■

■

10

operation of the park only for white persons and not for the

II

mixing of the races.

12

park for whites and secondly, a purpose that there not be any

13

raiding of the races in the park, but a single indivisible

14

purpose, and that was the construction and interpretation of the

15

will placed upon it under state law by the Supreme Court of

16

Georgia.

17

Not to have two purposes: one to have a

|

!

i

Faced, as we see it, with the impossibility of

18

reconciling those three facts, the Supreme Court of Georgia

19

then held that under stata law the trust had failed and the

20

property had reverted.

21

It seems to us that the State Supreme Court decision

22

had nothing to do with racial discrimination as such, because

23

that issue was eliminated by this Court in Evans versus Newton, j
holding the park could no longer be operated in accordance withj

24
25

c

racial limitations.

24

i

We disagree very strongly with a statement in their

2

brief and I believe Hr. Nabrit repeated this in oral argument,

3

that the Georgia decision might be citeds "For the proposition

4

that State Courts may generally decree reversion of property

5

for breach of a racial condition.”

6

argument they forget that this;did not involve property pur-

7

chased subject to a racial condition, nor does it. involve

8

property that was originally, public; nor does it involve

9

property that became public property, in the broad sense of

It seems to us that by that

10

that terra.

n

And it is fundamental, as we understand the law, that a person

12

who creates a charitable trust may condition the use of the

13

property.

It was, in its inception, Senator Bacon’s property.

14

We do not argue that a testator can require that the

15

property ba used in a manner contrary to law* but on the other

10

hand we do say that the property may not be used in a manner

17

violative, of the express conditions .imposed upon the use of the

18

property, that under those circumstances there would be

19

a failure of the trust and the property would go according to

20

whatever the applicable laws of the state might be;
It seems to us further that the contention that

21

22

Nigras might, be discouraged by the decision of the Georgia

23

Supreme Court from assarting their rights is a hollow argument.

24

This was not, again., public property ini the usual sense of that

23

term.

It was trust property, the use of which was subject to

25

1

conditions set forth in Senator Bacon's will.

2

practical matter, furthermore, it seems to us unlikely that

3

there is a similar situation in existence anywhere in the
/ *

4

country.

5

encourage similar testimentary trust because Evans versus

6

And as a

And moreover, the Georgia decisions that heartily

Newton is now the law of the land establishing that first of

7

all, a person eannofc effectively devise or convey his property

8

to a municipal corporation in trust with a racial condition.

9

And secondly, a municipality cannot accppt such a trust as

trustee.
So, we don't see how the decision of the Georgia
Court, which is in obedience to that mandate of this Court,
could be said in any respect to encourage similar raciallyoriented testimentary trust.
As we understand the effect of the arguments that
are being made by Petitioners, they say that, the Supreme Court
: Georgia erred, not in applying Federal Law, but in its deter'
mination and application of state law. I'd like to comment
specifically on that in more detail in just a moment, in
replying to the argument of Mr. Claiborne for the United States.;
Finally, with this branch of our argument, it seems
to us that the mere recognition by the State Supreme Court that the trust has failed does not, in and of itself, constitute

23
24

impermissible state action.

The fact that the Georgia Court

rendered a decision which is not in accord with the contention
25
28

1

of the Petitioners, doesn't mean in and of itself that the

2

State has denied them any constitutional protective rights.
As we see it, one must have a right before it can be

3
4

denied.

And neither the Nigra citizens or the white citizens

5

of the City of Macon had the right under Federal or State Law

6

to require that Bacon's property be used as an integrated park

7

in direct violation of the trust terms of his will.

8

We don't believe that persons belonging to a par­

9

ticular class or group or religion may create rights simply

10

by asserting claims in a Stats Court and having them denied.

1.9

20
21

22
23

25

And as we see it, that is the effect of the position of the
✓
Petitioners in the present case.
Q

Well, what would you suppose would have

happened in what we view the law, if the simply had simply
opened the park to Negroes and whites alike?
A

Rather than resigning as trustee?

Q

Yes.

Then the heirs of Senator Bacon sued.

A

Your Honor, I think the posture of the case

would still be the same when it got back to the Supreme Court,

I

following Evans versus Newton*, since the Trial Court had
I

originally seen fit to remove the City as Trustee involuntarilyj
If the Trial Court had removed the City involuntarily in this
case and it had corns to the Court as it did in Evans versus
Newton, the same result would have taken place.

That is, the

holding that the park could not operated as a racialiy27

1

restricted park»

2

I don’t believe the Court suggested in Evans versus

3

Newton that the City should be compelled to serve as trustee

4

against its wishes.
Q

5

6

You mean the State is entitled to use its

courts to enforce a private discriminatory decision?

7

A

No —•

8

Q

Contrary to the desires of those presently in

9

possession?

10

'A

'ii

that the is what lias been done in this case.

Q

12
13

We do not take that position and don’t feel
We feel —■

Do youfeel that: it would have been done in the

case I pose?

A

14

I think in view of the holding in Evans versus

15

Newton that that would have .been' the effect of it? yes, because

16

this Court has now established as the law of this case that

17

the park cannot be operated either by the city or by private

18

trustees, according to the racial restrictions.

19

so, 1 think the involuntary removal of the City as trustee would

20

have been held by this Court to have been impermissible state

21

action.

And that being

22

We are not seeing this as involving state action at

23

all in what took place following Evans versus Newton, because

24

it was purely and simply a question of whether or not the trust!

!

25

had failed and --

28

Q

I
2

Well, if the City hadn't resigned and had merely

opened the park to whites and blacks alike? and if then the

3

State could not. have enforced the kind of restriction in its

4

courts, should this case, be any different just because the
!

5

City resigned?
A

6
7
8
3
10
11
12

In the final analysis I don't think the fact

that the resignation was voluntary, makes any difference on the
questions that are now presented to the Court, because I think
ultimately the questions — the same questions would have
arisen if, ,first of all, the purpose of the trust had failed
and secondly, if so, what would happen to the property under
state law?

I

!

13
14

15
16

17

With reference to the cy pres doctrine itself, again, !
I've largely set forth my thoughts in response to questions
about it, but again I would make the point that the only coni
cern of the State Supreme Court was whether the use of the park !
by Nigras would violate Bacon “ :s restrictions?

As a matter of

his personal social philosophy he expressed the purpose set
,18
19
20
21

22
23
24

forth in this trust»

i

As we sea it, the argument of cy pres is directly
contrary to state law and it has . been so held by the State
Supreme Court, based upon two propositions 1 mentioned: first
i
of all, cy pres is applied only where there is a genera.'
charitable intent and a failure of the mode of execution of it* j
.

And secondly, under state law is never applied wfterg
25

29
.

1

it would be directly contrary to the intent of the testator.

2

Q

Hr. Jones, in that connection and 1311 corae back

3

to the earlier question put to you by Mr. Justice Harlan; as

4

I read the Petitioner's brief they claim that this was a new

3

’
application, basically, of the cy pres law of Georgia.

6

this is on Page 57 of their brief;

7

Adams against Bass, and we remember what that case was.

8

9

How,

It is the application of

"Ho Georgia case has been found in which a trust was
allowed to fail, when beneficiaries and trustee were still in
.

10

being, and 'when the intended benefit could still be received,

11

merely because the trust could not be carried cut in the manner

12

directed by the settlor, or because its benefits were extended

13

to a larger class, without in any way diminishing the enjoyment

14

of the intended beneficiaries."

15

position that; "Respondents speak of the case at bar as having

16

been decided under 8well-settled principles of Georgia law,*

17

that point out, but 61te no cases anywhere to back this up.”
A

18
13

i

And then, a footnote to your

Your Honor, I will answer that this ways that

the well-settled principles of state law are two cod® sections,
.

20

which obviously set forth the law of the state as clearly as

2!

possible.

Q

To this case

2

A

1 would assume that to be the most respectable

possible authority that we could cite to this Court,
Q

4

But I gather, and I think the claim is made

5

that this case is a novel application or failure to apply the

6

cy prsi® doctrine.

7
8

We disagree with that most strongly j
l
if it suggests novelty as far as the law is concerned. I

9

think it's novel only in the factual situation that was presen­

10

h

Yes, sir»

I
ted to the Court.
Q

15

Well, you -have..distinguished, as 2 follow your

12

argument, Mr. Jones, between the situation in which the cy pres;

13

doctrine could be applied as to have a result which was in

14

reason, consistent with the original, and one which is dia­

15

metrically opposed.

16

there is no purpose to which they can put this park as a park,

17

which would not be diametrically opposed to the expressed

18

intents.

19

Vi

..

x

j

And you say, as I understand it, that

Is that your argument?
A

Yes, sir; that is my argument exactly.

And 1

20

think that argument is well founded, first of all, in the

21

language of the will itself, and secondly, the will has been so

22

interpreted under Rules of Construction, by the State Supreme

23

Court, that there was a single, sole, indivisible exclusive

24

purpose and that it would not be possible now to operate the

23

park without doing so directly in violation of the terms of

i

31

1

Senator Bacon°s will and that that, and that alone, is the

2

reason the trust failed under State Law.

3

4
§

Q

And you think it makes no difference to those

terms or term which no longer constitutionally permissible? •
A

Your Honor, obviously that made a difference in

6

Evans versus Newton.

7

applying the Rules of State laws that were applied on remand to

8

the Georgia Supreme Court.

9

past of the will, even though it may have become constitutio! ally

10
11

I don * t think it makes a difference in

1 don *f think you can ignore any

impermissible because of the decisions of this Court.
Still, under .settled rules of construction it becomes

12

the burden of the State Court to determine, first of all,

13

the purpose of the creator, and secondly, if that purpose has

14

failed as specified, whether or not cy pres can be applied.

15

And they resolved both of those questions unfavorably to the

16

Petitioner in this case.

17

Q

On that theory, if I follow your argument, on

18

that point, constitutional factors corns into play only as to

19

the use of the park; not as to the reversion?

20

A

j

Yes, sir.

As Mr. Justice Slack stated in his

2!

dissenting Opinion so far as he had found at that time there hav

22

been no prior decision of this Court questioning the fact that j

23

the matterof reversion is a state law question.

24

25

We have cited in our briefs, other cases.to the same
effect, such as the holding of this Court in March versus
32

1

Alabama, where the pojant was made in the footnote very effec­

tively that dedication has always been regarded as a state law

craestion, that is: whether there was a dedication, and if so,

I
those are state law questions.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

true, as he said, that a state statute which provided in terms

Isn't if really

10

for what has actually been dons in this case would be pretty

obviousXy unconstitutional.

12

That hypothetical law would say something like this;

13

that even if the testator expressed no intent on the issue of

14

reversion and even if there ware no difficulties in administer­

15

ing the park nonracially; and if the name beneficiaries could

16

still get benefits and their benefit was not diminished, that a

•

20

really cantmake a difference if the rule I have just now stated

21

is now Georgia’s common law and not a. statute law, really, the

22

essence of the case, I think, is simply that Georgia, acting

23

through its courts, has chosen to

rather than to have it integrated.

that article, I think, contains all the arguments that chari­

and the present.
In that case, which is discussed at Pages 47 and 48
of our brief, the North Carolina Court had two deeds before it ;
and. one deed had an express racial reverter and the Court gave

But the other deed in that ease didn't have — it had;

Thank you.
Mr. Nabrit, you have just said Uv?t Senator

18

Bacon did not make that choice.

The Georgia Courts said; if

19

I read their opinion correctly, that he did make that choice.

20

Do you agree that that's the predicate of the Georgia Supreme

21

Court holding?

22

A
Mo, I think not.
I think they

thka to interpret Bacon's will to mean that this is anything

25

other than what we contend; that ha wanted a park and he wanted |
it for whits people.and he didn't want Negroes in it; that's the

36

1

purpose of the park.

2

was that when Negroes had to be admitted to the park somehow

o

it would be impossible to have a park,

4

to have an all-white park.

5

Now, there is no —

their decision

it did become impossible

I am not — to be sure there is a kind of equality

6

created by destroying 'the park for everyone, since before only

7

Negroes were excluded mid now everyone is excluded, but that

8

kind of superficial ^equality doesn’t, for me, fulfill the

9

state’s obligation to afford Negroes the equal protection of

10

the law, but what we object to is the forfeiture itself, and

11

the message of that kind of forfeiture decreed by state law,

12

it seems to me, is pretty plain.

13

It says something like this to Negroes*

It says that

14

the law honors a will leaving land to a city for whites only

IS

more than it honors your right to come on city property.

16

says that your presence, even though lawful, so changes the

17

character of a public park that the law prefers no park than a

18

park open to you.

19

And it

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER* I think your time is up,

21

22

Mr. Nabrit.
I think I may have interrupted someone on this side of

j

the bench to ask a question.
I

23

0

I had two questions I Id like to asks What is

24

your view as to whether or not this holding as to the state

25

cy pres doctrine represented or did not represent a deviation
37

1

from prior Georgia law?

2

A

My view is that there were ho Georgia cases —

3

Q

There were none?

4

A

— which clearly determined that the statute

5

the two statutes Mr. Jones has referred to, set out on Page 55

6

of our brief, arcs what the Georgia Court was using.

7

those-statutes only have any meaning when the testator's

a

intent can't be found.

9

statutes.
The first ones

10

11

And that

That's the only time that you use these

"When a valid charitable bequest is

incapable for seme reason of execution in the exact manner pro-

13

;
vided by the testator, donor or founder, a. Court of Equity will!
i]
carry it into effect in such as way as will as nearly as

14

possible effectuate his intentions."

12

Obviously Bacon's will couldn't be carried out

15

16

exactly as he intended.
Q

17

As I understand the Georgia Court's Opinion it !

18

said that the cy pres statute didn't come into play at all,

1©

because under Georgia Law, given the provisions that Mr. Bacon

20

— Senator Bacon's will is lacking the general charitable

21

purpose.

j

And ray question is:does that, holding represent a

22
23

deviation from prior Georgia Law?
(A1

24
25

contend —

And my answer is the same, I'd say.
we have never found any case like this „

38

We don’t

1

Q

I just have one other question;

Supposing

2

this had been an entirely city-owned property and run on a

3

desegregated basis, of course.

4

that park?

5

Could the city have abandoned

For
A

Well, for — I think that where the city makes

6

a present political judgment, prudential judgment, that it

7

wants to abandon a public facility that that may be done.

8

However, I think that that kind of decision is subject to

9

examination by proper authorities .as to whether or not its a

10

subterfuge, as to whether or not they are really doing this

1?

as a 'method of thwarting desegregation, for example.

12

13
14

0

Now, there would be no Federal right in that

would there, in the City making that abandonment?
A

I think the qualification — * for practical

15

purposes the qualification I made is the important thing.

16

Because here the purpose is admitted.

17

Q

There is no doubt at all,

Where do you find that discriminatory, motive

18

which, in answer to my hypothetical you say‘would have given

19

rise to a Federal right.

20

A

X find that the discriminatory motive in this

21

case, from the start to the finish, really! from the 1905

22

statutes which would start it all off — from the action of the

23

Georgia Courts in running it as a white only park all these

24

years using the taxpayer's money — and the city running it ail

25

those years using the taxpayers* money? from the actio:* of the
39

s

4

Georgia Courts in trying to evade the admission of Negroes by
removing the city as trustee and now in the present decision,
to close the park rather than have Negroes in it.
that the state acted

So, I think

in the case from start to finish-»
