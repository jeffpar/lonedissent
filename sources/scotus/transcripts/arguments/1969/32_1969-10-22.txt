ARGUMENT OF ARNOLD 0ROMAN, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ORDMAN;

8
9

Court;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United

10

States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to review a judg­

n

ment of that court which substantially abridges a back-pay

12

order entered by the National Labor Relations Board because, as

13

the court below saw the case, the. Eoard had been guilty of

14

inordinate delay in initiating the back-pay proceeding»
There has already been extensive litigation in this

15
IS

matter before the Board and before the courts.
The relevant events giving rise to the controversy

17
13

occurred when the union engaged in a one-year strike starting

19

in 1954.

20

bargain and other unfair labor practices, continuing a previous

21

pattern of conduct to which the court below made reference in

22

its decision here under review.

23
24
25

The company countered immediately with a refusal to

In August of 1957, the court below entered a decree
enforcing a Board order which, among other things, directed the
respondeat, the Rutter Rex Company, to reinstate with back pay
2

1

all of the striking employees in this 1954 strike Who had

E.

applied for reinstatement and to dismiss, if necessary, replace­

3

ments who were hired subsequent to the date of the strike.
Pursuant to settled practice, many details about com­

4

S

pliance with that decree were left for subsequent resolution.
In 1961, the Board, pursuant to Board order and court

6
7

decree, and because of noncompliance, initiated a formal back­

8.

pay proceeding in which it found that as of June 30, 1961, the

9

company was obligated to pay a total of about $159,000 to 171

W

employees who had applied for reinstatement.

11

Now, actually, four years and three months elapsed

12

between the enforcing decree of the court below in August- of

13

1957 and November 1961 when the Board, «after the initial prepara­

14

tory work, formally initiated the back-pay proceeding.
The court below concluded that the Board was guilty

15

IS
17
18
19

of inordinate delay an this regard, to the prejudice of the
offending company, and terminated the company's back-pay liability
as of June 30, 1959, which was two years earlier than the
Board's cut-off date.
Of course, this modification had the necessary effect

2©
21
22
23
24
25

of denying further back-pay relief to about one-fifth, about
35, approximately, of the 111 employees, strikers, to whom the
company had not even offered reinstatement as of the June 30,
1961 date, so 'potentially they would have even more back pay
coming.
3

The question presented, therefore, is whether the

t
2

court below erred in penalising aggrieved employees for alleged

3.

inordinate delay on. the part of the Board which., if the Board

4

was culpable at all, was attributable to the Board, and cer­

B

tainly not to the aggrieved employees.
We think the issue can be made even more narrow.

6
1

The court below finds, and respondent apparently is not con­

8

testing, that the defense of laches ..or undue delay is not

9

applicable, even if it were otherwise applicable, cannot be

30

invoked against the Government, any of its agencies, and, of

n

course, the National Labor Relations Board.
On the other hand, we cf the agency do not challenge

12

is

the power of a reviewing court to eliminate or modify a Board

14

order.

13

attempt to achieve an end other than what the Act contemplates,

16
il
iQ
19
20
2T
22
23

24.
23

In a case where, for example, that Board is a patent

or even as this Court said in the 7-Up case, the Board cannot
apply a remedy which is worked out on the basis of experience
if in the particular situation the application of that remedy
would be oppressive and, therefor®, not. calculated to enforce
the policies of the Act.
This, as we see it, if the Court please, is. the rela­
tively narrow frame of reference in which we believe the questie n
here presented must be appraised.
The court below in the back-pay proceeding, as in the
prior enforcement proceeding, found no evidence of the' unfair
4

1

labor practices in which the company had engaged and, recognized

2

that the Board's typical order of reinstatement and hack pay

3

was an appropriate remedy for the unfair labor practices found,.

4

But the court went on to look at the delay factor to

5

determine whether that delay factor called for a modification

6

or elimination of the Board’s back-pay order.

7

was also made before the Board,,

This contention,

The Board rejected it.

But on this phase of the case, the court below con­

S

cluded that the delay of the Board, this four-year, or more

3
to

accurately, as the court below also noted, a three-year delay,

11

was inordinate, and that the impact of that inordinate delay

IE

was so prejudicial to the company as to warrant cutting down,

13

and it selected what it thought was an appropriate date, with

14

no particular reason, cutting down by two years the back-pay

IS

period for which the company was otherwise answerable..
By this actionV as I noted before, the court corres­

16

17

pondingly cut down, although it made no mention of it, the back

18

pay to which the aggrieved employees, who were themselves inno­

19

cent of any fault, and who were, in our view, a pivotal concern

20

21

22

i

of the National. Labor Relations Act, cut down their rights be*
cause of the Board's alleged inordinate delay.
We really make three propositions here. We''■submit

23

first that the court below erred in the first instance when it

24

concluded that the Board was even guilty of inordinate delay.

23

We submit second that even assuming some degree of
5

culpability attached to the Board because of the delay, the
court below erred so egregiously in its appraisal of the com­
peting interests' of £.11 the parties involved', including the
interests, of course, of the aggrieved employees, as to require
a reversal of its holding.
Finally, we believe that analysis will show that what
the court below did, in effect, was to say laches, or undue
delay, does not apply against the Government, which is concerne;
with protecting public rights, but turned around and, iri
essence, applied that same analysis to justify the action it
took.
Let me talk about, if I may.
little bit.

Board!

teray a

We don’t, mince any words in this regard.

We hav ipi

acknowledged, throughout these proceedings that the delay of
four years and three months, or even three years, when this
back-pay matter really became alive, that the elapse of time
between the enforcing of the decree and the institution of the
Board’s initiation of back-pay proceedings is unfortunate, is*
regrettable, it is prejudicial to everybody concerned, to the
respondent, to the beneficiaries of the decree, who

go

without

work and without back pay through this period,.and a matter
about which we once said, in an earlier proceeding, we could
well be red faced.
a

We might note, however, that the prejudice to the
respondent in this case is a little doubtful*

The respondent

own pocket.

If respondent had carried out its obvious statu­

4

strike was called off and when they applied for reinstatement,

5

much of these proceedings, much of the back-pay travail about

6

which tilt' respondent complains now, would have been obviated.
Q

7

What if the company had at that time good-faith

and substantial issues about any particular employee or group of

8

employees in the senso that it. had what it thought was a decent

9

10

ground for arguing that this employee was not entitled to back

11

pay or reinstatement.

12

is entitled to an early opportunity to litigate those issues

13

and to reinstate at that time would, in effect, moot those

14

questions.

15

A

I suppose its position would be

,;hat it

The court below mentioned this contention, which

'

16
17

was raised by the respondent.

In the first place, the court be­

low noted that the order in the enforcing decree was so plain

IS

that, in the court’s language, it could not have been misunder­

19

stood.

20
21

22
23

24

If the respondent were still under the impression
that there was something confusing about that order, that it
had something, it could well have asked either the Board or the
court to clarify that situation.
Q

No such move was made,

What is the usual practice in back-pay situations

Do companies and the Board normally anticipate that there will
25;

7

I

be a back-pay proceeding, or some enforcement activities to
work out what the action will be?

tion what the order required, as it frequently require?! in a

Q

On what grounds?

A

On the grounds either that they had been rein­

stated, some had been reinstated before the strike was called
off, some might well have not been interested in further employ­
ment, some of the 130, or some may conceivably may not have beer,
on strike.

On any of these grounds, we did eliminate 130.

Would there be any ground on which the employer

could refuse to reinstate any of those 600?

This would have relieved the obligation of the company

f
That was just after litigation that that was

7

determined.

more than that who were disentitled.

U

13

20
21

Yes.

q

Wasn’t it entitled to an early resolution of

j

those claims?
A

15
16

A

It could, and it could have called upon, as '1

say, the Board or the court to clarify its position in this
regard.

It took no such action, indeed.

When the back-pay

hearing was held, in 1959 and .'I960, the principal company de­
fense, or one of its major defenses, is that it had no vacancies
for these strikers to whom it had denied reinstatement.
But as the Trial Examiner’s report cites in detail,

'

22
23
24
23

in most of those cases the record showed the reason it had no
vacancies is that replacements were occupying those positions.
In many instances, that was the only defense the company offeree
in the face of an order which required that reinstatement should
9

1

2

be effected, even dismissing, if necessary, replacements.
We believe the Trial Examiner's report, which the
Board adopted, and the court's own decision, the court pointed

4

out in its opinion, that it examined this impossibility of

3

compliance defense very carefully and it concluded in practically

6

these precise words that it was not impossible fox* the company

7

to comply, and in many respects it did not comply, indicating —

8

Q

I would suppose the company could have complied

9

by just reinstating strikers, no matter what, but what about

m

those instances where it thought it had a good faith defense

n

to reinstatement.

12

The place to go was to litigates the matter with you people,

13

was it not?

14

A

15
16

M
18

The place to go wasn’t the Court of Appeals

Precisely, and the company had this opportunity

and it initiated no action.
Q

The only request the company made

I thought it was waiting for you.

You told them

you would be in touch with them, or something.
A

Yes.

The company predicates much of its defense

13

on a letter it wrote on November 7, 1357, about two months after

20

the enforcing decree.

22

22
23'
24
25

It wrote the Board a letter saying, in

essence, "toe have complied.with some of the provision?; of the
Board’s order.

How, will you please notify us of any instances

where we have not complied?"
The company says,

on that basis, sines wa didn't notify

them, they weren’t obliged to comply any further.

10

The court below said an offending respondent which

I
2

has the primary obligation can't get rid of its obligation by

<s
•j

merely saying "You didn't tell us."

4

what they were obliged to do.

;

The court had told them

17
13
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

You say they have agreed they are valid and they

haven’t been paid?
A

Why?

On what grounds?

I presura© the company must be awaiting the out­

come of this proceeding, which only has to do with cutting back
the back pay, not eliminating it.

This Court denied certiorari

on the portion of the order that was enforced.
Also, this company was rather familiar, as the court
below said, this company was not a baba in the woods, and I
think the language of the court is significant in this regard.
It said, "This company is not a babe in the woods,” and tits
principal premise on which the court below limited the back pay
was on the ground that the court below felt that somehow the
11

f

company had been lulled into a sense? by the Board's delay,

2

that maybe it had nothing left to do and that it had no obli­

3

gations anymore by the Board5s delay.

4

3

This might corns with more grace, I think, with an
unsophisticated employer, but this is what the court below saids

6

‘''The record convinces: us that Sutter Raw. is not. a

1

babe in the woods about to be victimised for ignorance

3

or inadvertent ineptitude in the field of employer-employee

9

relations as regulated by the National Labor Relations Act

10

The order in this case, which ordered immediate rein­

ft

statement of strikers, even if they had to hire replacements

\Z

who were still employed by the company, although not all striker

13

ware replaced, the order, the court below said, just could not

U

have been misunderstood, but as of today, that reinstatement

15

obligation has not yet been carried out and none of the back pay

IS

has been paid.

17

As the Trial Examiner pointed out, at the time of the

18

back-pay hearing, replacements were still working, and much of

19

the back-pay hearing, of this long back-pay hearing, was devoted!

20

to analysing the back pay due strikers where replacements were

21

still working at the jobs the strikers should have had.

22

The record demonstrates, as I said before, and this

23

is the court's language, that it wasn't impossible for the com­

24

pany to comply, and as to many individuals it did.

25

that in this situation, with this kind of sophisticated company
12

We think

t

in the area of labor relations, and represented, as the court

2

below noted, by able counsel, that they weren't lulled into

•C*

/*t

any sense that they had already complied with the.deera e of the

4

court below.

5

On the contrary, we believe that to affirm the court8 s

6

order below would be to really reward a malingering and an in­

7

transigent refusal to comply with the Board order and a court,

a

decree at the expense of a public policy.

B

‘
1 might say, in regard to that letter, also, inhere

m

the company tried to shelve ics responsibility by saying a

n

couple of months after the decree, "?m tell as when we vio­

m

lated the Act," that we routinely send a letter, and we sent a

13

letter right after this decree to this respondent saying, "We

14

ere ready to help you comply with this order, and, incidentally,

15

when you have complied, we will send you a letter not3.ry2.ng you

16

that the compliance has been effected and the case closed.”

17

Also, incidentally, in case the company had any

m

doubts t it had just received such a letter in an earlier un­

19

fair labor practice case where we told them, "In this case, you

20

have complied and the case is closed.1'
We never sent a closing compliance letter.

21

Q

22

23
M
25

In that case, after there has been an order of

reinstatement, may there be determined in the back-pay proceed­
ing whether or not a particular employee is entitled to rein­
statement?

It is not* merely whether he is entitled to back

9

q

When you get an order ”Reinstate all strikers,"

what does that mean,
A

10

;hen?

The order to "Reinstate all strikers'5 is to rein'

12

gives back pay to people while they are strike.

How about reinstatement?

The Court of Appeals

14

ordered reinstatement of all strikers.

Q

What is the order of the Court, of Appeals?

It

2

doesn't mean much if it says "Reinstate'all strikers,81 but then

n-

the company says "Well, I am not going to reinstate these 200

4

because I have valid defenses and I will put my defenses to the

5

Board whenever I get a chance» if ever."

Q

A

The Court of Appeals and this Court have long ag:

7

settled on the proposition that tee could either» in a case of

S

this ease? with 6’0Q potential claimants,

9

labor practice proceeding, go through the inordinate amount of

20

at that point and ask. where our order is challenged ant fee:::..

13

Q

What is the order that you said is so open and

15

16

original order?

17
IS
19
20

A

Is that the

The obligation of compliance, or the obligation

of re insta tertian t „
Q

No, no.

The original order of the court was

“Reinstate all strikers. ”

Is that the one you are speaking of?

21

A

That is the one we are speaking of.

22

Q

How do you say it is open and shut if there is

23

still to be litigated, as to individual strikers whether the

24

individual striker is or isn't entitled to reinstatement?

25

is that open and shut?

15

How

1

A

2

That is not open and shut, to the extent there

are defenses.

'H.

Q

Isn't that what this case is all about?

A

A

Ho.

This case is about the large bulk of the

5

strikers, excluding those who were engaged in misconduct, as to

e

which
Q

7

How do you know which ones they are until it is
The company says there are .100 and it turns cut

B

litigated?

9

that there were only 10.

10

A

This is precisely what the back-pay proceeding

n

contemplates, and the machinery is devised and this Court in

m

the Wallace case, among other cases, said that the only alter­

n

native would be to labor the initial unfair labor practice pro­

u

ceeding with a long, long, involved hearing as to what the

15

individual rights are.

'

ts

Therefore, the original enforcing decree contemplates

u

that these details about the amount of back pay or the occasions 1

18

case where an employee is not entitled to reinstatement, will

19

be resolved afterwards.

In other words, as I think the Second

20

Circuit used the language, and so did the Fourth, that the

21

enforcing decree is in the nature of an interlocutory order

22

which contemplates further proceedings.

23

Q

What you are saying is that the employer, if he

24

refuses to reinstate on the grounds that he has got a valid

23

defense, he has to run the risk of having to pay back pay if
16

t

ie is wrong.

2

A

That is correct.

3

q

And it doesn’t make, any difference how long he

4

has to wait for a hearing.

He said, ”J have a valid asrense.

S

I want an early hearing on this," and the Board waits three or

6

four years.

7

A

That is just the employer's hard luck.
Your Honor, X would like to say, in the first

8

place, if the burden must lie somewhere, we think it probably

'9

lies on the party that has violated the law.

10

q

How doss he get a hearing before the Board?

n

A

He could have brought a proceeding,•I suspect,

n

under — not "X suspect”j X believe firmly — he could have

13

brought a proceeding under the Administrativa Procedure Acc,

14

which he relies upon to expedite this matter if he reit the

13

Board was guilty of malingering.

I am not suggesting,

of culpable delay.

The record sets this forth quite completely.

The fact of the matter was that this record and the public record

that at that fine we were undermanned, overstaffed; frankly,

we didn’t want this case here, Your Honor, on the subject of

I am very happy to report that as of today we have licked this

very serious problem of delay, at least, at the administrative

level.

We don’t believe in delay, and although it is r.n aside,

But this wasn't a matter of culpability and if not
a matter of culpability, or even if we are culpable to a minor

18

degree, then we must balance the interests affected, our public

19

interest in protecting the policies of the Act, the interests

20

of the employer here who, as 1 say, was not a baba in the woods

21

and knew what it was doing, had great experience in unfair labos

of the employees here, that need not be detail led to tho Court,

<0

Mr. Read, let's assume that a companyr after a

8

general order like this in the Court of Appeals, feels chat it

9

has some good-faith defenses in connection with any number of

10

these strikers, end. it says, ”1 want to litigate this for the

11

Board," and it can do that, I take it.

14

'37

19
20
21

22
23

25

Those matters wore re­

served, under this order.
A

Yes.

Q

So it can litigate it.

I suppose you would agree

that if you lose in connection with Employee A, let us say, and
your defense is rejected, and you are then ordered to reinstate
him, I suppose you would agree you have to give him back pay.
A

I agree with that.

Q

So this case really boils down to whether or not

you can be ordered to give back pay if the proceeding where you
litigate the validity of your defenses happens to occur four
years instead of two years or one year after the general order
of the Court of Appeals.
You don't object right now, I gather, to the part of
the Court of Appeals order that says you have to pay them for
31

?

two years.

2

A

Oh, no, sir.

■O
***

Q

So it is just the other two-year back-pay order,

That is correct.

So it is a question of where the incidence of

delay must fall — on the employees or on the company.

7

A

G
O

This delay issue first was injected into the case wher

9

That is the case in a nutshell.

we tried to enjoin the back-pay hearing at the time that it was

10

filed in 1961.

The Board went into the Fifth Circuit at that'

11

time, and it didn’t deny that the delay occurred.

12

the delay occurred, and as the court said, it admitted an 1nordi

13

nate or unreasonable delay had occurred.

It admitted

But it said to the court, "Don't enjoin us from hold­

14
IS

ing a back-pay hearing, because we can take delay into jonsiciere

m

tion and we can protect the company's interest; and further, no

17

matter what we do, our decision with regard to delay will ulti­

18

mately be reviewed by the Fifth Circuit."
Then when the case proceeds under the back-pay speci­

19
20

fication, the Board doesn't make any reduction on the grounds of

21

delay.

22

delay and the Trial Examiner said that he didn't consider —

23

let me give you that exact language because I do believe it is

24

important.

25

In fact, the Board decision doesn't say a word about

Referring to delay, the Examiner, having ultimately
32

1

ruled —

2

Q

Where are you reading from?

3

A

I am reading from page 55 of the Joint Appendix.

4

The Examiner, having ultimately ruled that none of

5

these issues were properly before him for disposition, in accor­

6

dance with this ruling having refused, absent the proffer of

7

evidence of wrong or unlawful conduct on the part of the general

8

counsel; which was not forthcoming, to permit the parties fully

9

to develop the facts, regarding delay, 1 interpret that.
When the Fifth Circuit then, when the company complain

10

11

about the fact that the Board didn't take delay into considera­

12

tion, the Board comes into the Fifth Circuit and takes diametric­

13

ally opposed positions.

14

ing that we axe reviewing here now, that no unreasonable del a;/

It says at that time, in this proceed­

occurred, if it did it is up to us, in our discretion tc assess
it, it is up to us to decide what, if anything, to do about it,
and the limited judicial appellate procedure available to you
doesn't accord the Fifth Circuit the right to do anything about
it.
It says furthermore, even if the Fifth Circuit had
the right to review decisions in the delay area, it cannot do it
because if it does, it is applying the doctrine of laches to
defeat a public right.
I submit to the Court that this position or the part
of the Board is wrong in a number of very serious ways.
33

la

1

the first place, I do not accept the fact that the statutory

2

scheme, whether we he talking about the national Labor Relations

3

Rat or whether we are talking about the Administrative Procedure

4

Act, contemplates according an administrative agency the right

5

to judge itself fully , finally, and without review.

6

It may have the right in certain areas of expertise

7

in which it is assumed that they have expert knowledge to judge

a

the actions of litigants before it, but it has no expertise

9

when it comes to judging its own derelictions.

10

It

I say the Board

is wrong about that.
Secondly, ci the question of laches, the principal

12

case relied upon by the Board is Electric Vacuum Cleaner, a

13

decision of this Court.

14

sion here and it doesn't appear in the Circuit Court decision

IS

in Electric Vacuum Cleaner, I would like to call the Courtrs

The company complained about the fact, that there

2

was a 13-month delay, and it also complained about the -.'act

3

that the Board hadn't issued an intermediate report, which

4

procedurelly it was supposed to have done.
The company filed a petition for review under Section

5
6

10(f) of the Labor Act, just as we have done hers, and die Boarc

7

seeing what was developing, withdrew its order, which the com­

S

pany sought to review, and then moved to dismiss the petition

9

to review because there was nothing to review.

10

.s..

.

Some -time later, I think it was — well.,... X...don't

11

remember the exact date — but it was some time later on that

12

the Board then issued a new order, and because of what its

13

Secretary said in that record was an administrative error on

14

the part of the Board, and because of what the company claimed

15

was undue delay, the. Board excluded from the back-pay period a

16

9-month period, exactly in the same fashion as the Fifth Cir­

17

cuit has done in this case.

18

That position which the Board took in Electric Vacuum

19

Cleaner in the Beard proceeding was consistent with the position

20

which the Board took in the injunction case in the Fifth Circuli

21

because at that time there was no talk whatsoever about the
I

22

inability of the Board to take its own delays into consideratxoi

23

in fashioning a back-pay order.

24
25

In substance, we say that the Board should not be permitted to issue orders which require further definition, and the n
35

t

wait an inordinate length of time befpre initiating the admin­

2

istrative procedure which is required to define the company5s
obligation,-, and then second-guess the company on what it did in

4

its reinstatement program in the meantime.

complaint in this case.

That is our basic

I started to make a reference to something 1 consider

7

important and I would like to say it briefly because it is not

8

in my brief, and that is, 1 want to make a reference to Section

9

101.16 of the Board’s rules, which provide that after a Board

10

order directing payment of back pay has been issued, or after

n

enforcement of such order by a court decree, if informal efforts

12

to dispose of the matter prove unsuccessful, the Regional

13

Director is then authorized, at his discretion, to issue a back­

14

pay specification.

I consider that significant because they mad 5 no
effort to work this out with us at all.

They simply went in

and filed this specification seeking $342,000 in November of
1961, four years and four months after the opinion of the Fifth
Circuit enforcing the decree of reinstatement with the reserva­
tions which I have referred to, and the Compliance Officer for
the Board testified at the hearing that he knew that our. letter
was in the record asking to be advised of any deviation from
the obligations of compliance, we were on record as wanting to
comply, and he did not make any effort to discuss with us an
informal resolution of all of the problems which had to be
36

1

resolved before there could be a clear definition of what the

2

Board order required.

3

Q

4

Have you any approximation of what amount

of money is involved hers?

A

5

Yes* sir.

Originally* the specification sought

e

$342*000.

7

ing before the Examiner and before the court* so that is 45

8

people that we were right about.

In the hearing* we eliminated 45 people in the hear­

The court order reduced the amount to approximately

S
10

$162*000,

11

$90*000 or $95*000, but there is interest running since 1964,

12

so that I make a rough approximation of the company * s obligatior.,

13

if it wins this case, is still somewhere in the neighborhood

14

of $140,000.

15

16
17
18

20

The order of the Fifth Circuit reduced it to about

That is if we win this case.

Now, if we lose this case, what the Board, intends to
clo is go back and file another specification and try to exact
back pay from 1961 to date, I presume.

Q

You contended before the court, I gather from

its opinion, that you didn’t owe them anything.
A

We contended that for this reason; and we lost'

21

on this point, but if I may foe permitted to say so, I still

22

think I am right.

23
24
25

Q

Lawyers usually do.

A

Well, this was the point, Justice Black.

The

Board order said to reinstate immediately upon application.

37

1

I took the position that this was prospective in nature; that

2

we couldn't reinstate immediately somebody who had applied a
year before the Board order.

So we took the position in the

4

Fifth Circuit, in an attempt to win the case completely, that

5

we were only responsible to reinstate those people who applied

6

prospectively or after the data of the order, but we lost on

7

that, unfortunately, but that is the basis of the contention

8

that I made at that juncture that we didn’t owe them anything.

9

It was on the basis of the interpretation of Drier, which I

10

think has some relevance here,, as well, because it is another

1!

indefinite aspect of the order.

12

Q

What is the actual difference between you now?

13

A

The difference between —-

14

Q

Financial, in money.

15

A

Leaving out interest, it is a difference, if you

16

don’t hold me to too accurate a figure, of $162,000 as compared

17

to about $95,000.

18

Q

About $95,000, and that is all the difference?

IS

A

That is all the difference.

20

Q

What led the Board to cut down the Trial Examine:

A

We won a lot of the cases. Justice White, on

21
22

award?

23

the very issues that were contemplated by the Fifth Circuit in

24

its enforcing language, since we won some misconduct eases,

23

Q

So the Trial Examiner ordered something like
38

i

$300 r000?
A

2
3

The specification claimed $342(,000.

The

Trial Examiner ordered about $162,000,
Q

4
5

No, no,

1 see.

And then what happened?

What did the

Board give you?
h

6

The Board raade some minor adjustment, which is

7

insignificant;, but then whan we got to the Fifth Circuit, the

8

Fifth Circuit eliminated a few more of the cases and also put

9

a cut-off date, which cuts it down to about $95,000.
I know my time is about up.
