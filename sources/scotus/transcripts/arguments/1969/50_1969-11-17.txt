ORAL ARGUMENT BY JACOB L. SAFRON, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

7

MR. SAFRON:

Mr.Chief Justice and may it please the

8

Court:

9

in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

10

This matter is before this Court upon direct appeal

On the Opinion that Court -— a divided opinion.

11

Chief Justice Haynesworth dissenting -- holding that the

12

statutory scheme for the imposition of capital punishment in

13

North Carolina, in light of the opinion of this Court, in

14

United States v. Jackson, is unconstitutional.

15

issue before this Court today is the imnorfc and impact of the

16

Jackson opinion upon the laws of the State of North Carolina;

17

the laws of our sister states and of the Federal Judiciary.

18

Therefore, the

Onthe evening of November 22, 1963, Nathaniel Young,

19

a Negro gentleman who operated a house that could best be

20

described as a"party house" in the City of Winston-Salem,

21

North Carolina, opened — responded to a knock at the door,

22

opened the door slightly and was cut down by a shotgun blast.

23

Earlier that evening Petitioner or the Appellee in

24

this case, Henry C. Alford, had come to that house; Henry

23

Alford also is Negro; he had been
2

by a white girl.

1

They purchased several' drinks of liquor by 'the drink, which

2

under North Carolina prohibition laws is not legal»

3

Henry Alford gave Nathaniel Young his last dollar to rent a

4

room in that house»

5

into that room and after several minutes they left because

6

Henry Alford no longer had any money»

7

And then

Alford was accompanied by his girl friend

He demanded that this young lady leave with him»

8

Nathaniel Young, the proprietor of this house, said, "She

9

can stay here if she wishes»"

An argument ensued and Henry

10

Alford ran off with the young lady's coat, being chased by

11

Nathaniel Young and someone else»

12

1

Approximately 15 to 20 minutes later, there was a

13

knock at the door and Nathaniel Young was cut down by a shotgur

14

blast»

15

Alford was indicted by the Grand Jury of the Wake

16

County Superior Court for murder in the first degree»

17

was appointed.

18

Counsel investigated every witness named to him by Henry Alford,

19

except one, by the name of "Jap," who could not be found.

20

each case the testimony of Alford’s purported witnesses was

.21

contrary to Alford’s allegations as tottheir testimony.

22

Counsel

Counsel thoroughly investigated the case.

In

Upon recall of the case, Alford, through Counsel,

23

entered a plea of guilty to murder in the second degree which,

24

under North Carolina law, carries a maximum punishment of 30

25

years imprisonment„

He did not plead guilty to the capital
3

1

offense which,.- under the law then in the state, would have

2

carried a life sentence»

3

murder.
The state then placed on the stand the detective,

I didn't get that last statement.

Did you say

the first degree murder carried only a life sentence?
A

9

He pled guilty to second-degree

Upon a plea of guilty; upon a plea of guilty

it would carry a penalty of life,

10

Q

Yes.

A

But Alford pled guilty.to murder in the second

12

degree, which carries at a maximum a sentence of 30 years.
The state placed on the stand after the tender of

13

the plea. Officer Weatherman,

Yes, Your Honori it is.

Yes? the judges presiding at the trial want to

"Me then contacted Ruby McGill, where Alford

been living and Ruby, as a consequence of an interview with
her, said that she and Henry had been living together for some
three years; that they were at this address about five months;
that Henry left around dark, saying he would be back in a few
minutes.

At about two and a half to three hours later ha came

back and stated that he was breathing hard.

Appeared to have

been running and stated 'G.D. s.o.b.'s been running me and I'm
going to kill 'em.'

7

that he was going back, and went out the door.

"We talked to Betty Jean Robinson who stated that

The officer's testimony continues:
"While we was attempting to pick up Alford in regard
to this we went to the home of Sidney Lackey who lives down
a couple of houses across the street.
9

And we first went to

his house around 11:00 o'clock and asked hint if Henry had been

record, denied that he — "ain't shot no man.

From the

He was sentenced to 30

years in prison.■
Approximately three months later he filed a petition
for writ of certiorari infche North Carolina Court of Appeals.
The North Carolina Court of Appeals rejected the petition for
writ of certiorari, but remanded the case to the Superior
Court of Wake County for a plenary hearing under the North
Carolina Post-conviction Hearing Act.
In due course, with court-appointed counsel, the
hearing was held and the post-conviction

-.judge found that the
\

11

1

2

tender of the plea was freely and voluntarily made.
Several weeks later Alford filed a petition for

3

writ of mandamus with the Clerk to the Wake County Superior

4

Court? the purpose of which? I*m really not sure.

3
6
7
8

9
10
11

12
13
14
15

16

And that

was denied,,
The next step was the filing of an application for
writ of habeas corpus with the Clerk of the United States
District Court of the Middle District of North Carolina»

The

Court dismissed the petition at that time because Alford was
not within the jurisdictionoof the Court? but within a week or
unit
two he was transferred to a prison/that was in fcfee jurisdic­
tion of that court and that court reinstated the application.
Subsequently? .the Honorable Eugene Gordon? United
States Court Judge for 'the Middle District for North Carolina?

entered an opinion denying habeas relief.
Forty-eight days after the entry of Judge Gordon’s
order? Alford filed notice of appeal.

He also filed an

17
additional writ of habeas corpus? directly with the Fourth
18

19
20
21
22
23
24

Circuit Court of Appeals.

A panel of the Fourth Circuit held

that the court did not have jurisdiction due to the late
filing of the notice of appeal; but ‘that an additional applica­
tion of habeas corpus had been filed originally in that court.
Chief Justice Haynesworth of the Fourth Circuit?
entered an order concluding upon the original application in
that court that that plea of guilty was freely? voluntarily?

25
12

1

2

and understandingly entered.
Alford subsequently filed yet another application

3

for writ of habeas corpus with the United States District

4

Court for the Middle District of North Carolina and Judge

5

Gordon once again reviewed his contentions and denied relief.

6

From that denial,, Alford once again appealed to the

7

Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Q

of Appeals, in reviewing that application concluded that the

9

statutory scheme in North Carolina, for the imposition of

19

22

25

And the Fourth Circuit Court

capital punishment, was unconstitutional in light of the
United States v. Jackson.

The Jackson decision, having been

decided in the interim bet^aen Judge Gordon■s denial of habeas
relief, and the filing of the appeal.
Until 1949 in the State of North Carolina, upon a
conviction of a capital crime, the four capital crimes ares
murder, rape, arson, first-degree burglary.

The death penalty

was automatically imposed.
In 1949 the legislature amended the various acts to
permit a jury to recommend mercy; and upon that recommendation
the defendant would be sentenced to life imprisonment.
In 1953, yet another statute was passed: 15-162«X, •
which provided thatupon the tender of a plea of guilty to a
capital crime, in writing and represented by counsel, if that
tender is accepted by the" Solicitor of the State and approved
by the court, then life imprisonment would be mandatorily
13

!

imposed.

2

lii view of that scheme, the Fourth Circuit concluded

3

in light of Jackson, that the North Carolina statutory scheme

4

was invalid and held that Alford, who had tendered a plea of

3

second-degree murder, was coerced.

6

Early this year the legislature of North Carolina

7

repealed MCGS 15-162«1, the provision permitting the entry of

3

a plea o£ guilty to a capital offense.

9

It is o£ interest to note that at the present time

10

in North Carolina there ar© 11 defendants under sentence of

II

death.

12

imposed in February of 1963 to the present.

13

1983 to March of this year, prior to the repeal of the statute

14

there ar© six defendants under sentence of death.

These 11 commence from sentences of death initially

solely to impose the punishment.

A

Death,

6

However, may it please the Courts In the Alford

7

case we're really not concerned with this, because although

8

•the Fourth Circuit used Alford as a form to completely strike

9

down capital procedures of North Carolina,

Alford entered a

10

plea of guilty to second-degree murder, which completely

11

insulated him, not

only from the death penalty, but also
f

12

13

from the imposition of life imprisonment,
. The Jackson case decided in light of the Federal

14

Kidnapping Act, was in light of the Fadaral criminal procedure

15

in which a Federal criminal defendant could waive a jury trial

16

and be tried by a judge, in North Carolina, by constitution,

17

a criminal' defendant cannot waive his right to a jury trial

18

and a criminal defendent who pleads not guilty must be tried

19

by a jury.

£0

A bench trial is constitutionally impermissible.
Q

Hr. SafSf@n.f to go back towhat you said a momenti

2i

ago, that the effect that the United States Court of Appeals

22

for the Fourth Circuit in this case, used

23

vehicle by which to completely strike down and invalidate the

24

procedures for capital punishment in your state?

This is one aspect —

5

Q

Am 1 mistaken?

6

A

That's one aspect in the case, Your Honor,,

But

7

the opinion states quits clearly that in -the present posture

a

of the North Carolina statutes the various provisions for -the

9

imposition of the death penalty are unconstitutional, hence

10

capital punishment may not, under Jackson, be imposed finder

-any circumstances.

Court's consideration of the last habeus petition — there was '
a prior habeus petition, also.

But this transcript was not

available in the prior consideration in this case by the

The procedure in Worth Carolina, upon tender of a

guilty plea is that the state in verity form 'i?}- presents
what it contends is its evidence? that it3s a hearsay, sor^
of narrative by the state which is subject to no rules of

MRS. BRAY:

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

So to that extent your answer

to my brother Black’s question would be ”yes," just as a
generality?
MRS. BRAY:

Yes, because plea bargaining isn’t

coercive in the same way that the North Carolina statutory
scheme for capital punishment is coercive.

There is a vast

difference in degree because under the North Carolina law
you had to risk your life in order to plead not guilty and to
have a jury trial.

And normally in plea bargaining you are

just bargaining for a number of years and not for your life.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

22
23

Well, in every State in -the

Union 2 suppose plea bargaining is not unknown.

15

Some states have recently changed the rules.

MRS. BRAY:

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

it5s unconstitutional to plead guilty to any other offense

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL: Well, suppose it had been
manslaughter?
MRS. BRAY:

Well, the Fourth Circuit said that when

you plead guilty to -the lesser-included offense then that puts

10

a greater burden on the’ defendant -to show that his plea was

II

a result of the coercive nature of the statute.

12

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL:

Suppose the first-degree

13

indictment had been withdrawn and second-degree indictment

14

had been filed?

15

MRS. BRAY:

Then I wouldn't have a case.

16

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL:

17

MRS. BRAY:

What'3 the difference?

The difference is that ha can assert

18

his right to have a trial and to have his guilt or innocence

19

found by a jury and still not risk the death penalty.

20

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL:

No, I h think v?e misunderstood-

21

A person indicted for first-degree murder, they can't bargain,

22

so they withdraw the first-degree indictment arid put in a

23

second-degree indictment and he pleads guilty to the second-

24

degree indictment„

25

MRS. BRAY:

I understood you to say that’s all right.
Because the penalty for second-degree

murder Is the same regardless of whether lie pleads guilty or

So that would be all right.

MRS. BRAY: Yas, sir? but under the first-degree
murder statutes as they stood at the time that this defendant
was tried, if he pleaded not guilty he got the death penalty?

!0

if he pleaded guilty he only got life imprisonment.

And what

I understand U. S. v. Jackson says is: that you can't set up

12

two different penalties depending upon whether a man asserts

13

his rights to a trial by jury or whether he doesn't.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

that is, there had been no trial; there had been no plea?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

waive your right to a jury trials, or whether you pled not

12

The North Carolina statute is not severable? at

least has never suggested any manner in which it could ba

included offenses then you have a greater burden to show that
his plea of guilty wash's result of the unconstitutional
coercive effect of the statutory scheme.
So, I suppose if you kept going down under the
Fourth Circuit’s rule then at some point the coercion effect
of the statute would lose its strength.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

How could you figure that?

You're just trying to get away from a jury trial —
MRS. BRAY:

Yes, sir; I think that’s right.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:
MRS. BRAY:

Better to be hung?

Yes, sir.

MR. JUSTICE BRAY:

I -don’t see what degree would

have to do with it, whether it’s manslaughter, or as it is in
34

2

my- state he could be tried for — Alabama — he could be

2

convicted also for assault and battery or simple assault.

3

MRS» BRAY;

If —

MR. JUSTICE BLACK;

5

MRS. BRAY;

6

The Fourth Circuit said that the burden was on the

7

defendant to show that his guilty plea was, in fact, coerced

8

by the death penalty.

Is that true in North Carolina?

Yes, sir, I'm afraid that is true.

And I suppose that if he's proven guilty and the

9

20

state's willing to let him get off with an assault charge that

n

maybe the fear of the death penalty really wasn't the motiva­

12

ting force in his pleading guilty.

13

accept that low a degree of the included offense, than the

14

state probably doesn't have a very good case for obtaining the

15

death sentence.
MRS. BRAY;

16

If the state's willing to

I'd like to emphasise that this Court

17

inmost of its decisions on the question of retroactivity of

18

a constitutional principle, has established that in any case,

19

even though a particular constitutional principle is declared

20

to be perspective only in its application, any defendant who

21

can show that the facts of his case actually show an abuse of

22

due process is entitled to relief.
For example in the case of Davis against North

23
24

Carolina.

This court held that Davis's confession was, in

23

fact, coerced, even though the Court had just held that
35

1

Miranda and Escobedo were not retroactive»

2

that the principles established in Miranda and Escobedo were

3

relevant to the question of whether or not Jackson's coerced

4

confession was, in fact, coerced.

S

And the Court held

This is the case of a coerced guilty plea and it

0

seems to me that the principle laid down by the Court in

7

United States v. Jackson is relevant to the issue ofwhether

S

or not this guilty plea was, in fact, coarced.

3

record there seems to be no other conclusion one can reach

Now, in this

10

than that the defendant pleaded guilty in order to escape the

11

death penalty.

12

admitted his guilt to anyone, not even his attorney.

13

attorney testified at the first conviction hearing that the

14

defendant always said that ha was innocent, but that he would

15

plead guilty in order to avoid the death penalty.

16

He has never, so far the record shows, ever

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

His

Well, according to what was

17

introduced at the trial he admitted his- guilt, or at least he

18

admitted that he shot a man to the woman with whom he was

19

living when he returned? am I wrong about that?

20

MRS. BRAY;

23

state said it has as evidence.

The woman was not at the trial.

22

Thera was no evidence as such.

He was never given

23
24
25

But I point out that is only what the

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

It's true unless it's

refuted; isn't that the whole purpose of that presentation?
MRS. BRAY:

I8m not sure that, the defendant had any
3S

1

right to refute it,

1 think that the procedure is that the

2

state simply narrates what it contends is its evidence,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? And is the defendant in

3
4

the courtroom at the time that narration is given in the

5

record?

6

MSS. BRAY?

Yes.

And after the narration the

7

defendant said,, "I ain't guilty; I ain’t killed no man and I'm

8

only pleading guilty becuase they told me they were going to

9

gas me if I didn't,”

And the record shows that it took a great deal of
persuasion ever to get!him to plead guilty, that his attorney
approached his sister hnd his cousin, who was a policeman, and
that they prevailed upon him to plead guilty because the
attorney said he couldn't win the case and because the attorney
said that the facts were aggravated because he had been out
with ,a white woman just before tine murder.
I'd like to say a few words about the retroactive
effects of United States v. Jackson.

The principles which

this Court has set up in determining activity are: the
purposed to be served by the new standards; the effect of
reliance by law enforcement officials; and the effect of the
decision of retroactivity on the administration of justice.
Nov/, in one of the more recent cases on this subject;
Desist against the United States, the Court pointed out that
the purpose to be served by the new constitutional rule is
37

1

paramount; that, only if the purpose — and does not clearly

2

dictate retroactivity or nonretroactivity, do you go to the

3

second and third points; the reliance factor and the effect

4

on the administration of justice.
Mow,,in this case under North Carolina law in order

5

6

to avoid the coercive nature of the capital punishment pro­

1

visions of the statutes you have to plead guilty; you may not

8

have a bench trial; you have no choice but to completely waive

9

your right to a trial at ally which means that you waive your

10

right to a trial, you waive your right 'to have your guilt

If

proven by the state.

12

and confront your witnesses; you waive your right to a jury

13

trial.

14

You waive your right to cross-examine

Now, if the fact is to be considered in determining

15

whether or not a constitutional principle is retriactive is

16

whether or not the defendant has been deprived of a fair trial

17

and whether or not the new constitutional principle really

18

purifies the fact-finding process ofthe Court.

19

right of counsel is important enough to retroactivity then

20

surely the right to any trial at all is important enough.

21

22

Now, if the

hnd itss very possible, it seems to me that in a
situation where a man with a first-grade education is told by

*

23

his attorney that he can't win the case and that the facts are

24

aggravated and the jury are therefore not going to be favor­

23

able toward his position that he may very well plead guilty,
