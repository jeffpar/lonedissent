MR. SHEERER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Case Mo. 31, Brockington vs. Rhodes, is an election
case ona ppeal from the Ohio Supreme Court.

It is a case that

10

we feel,as this Court has said, deals with matters close to the

11

core of our constitutional system.

12

decided by this Court under the title Williams vs. Rhodes.

It follows a cast;, previously

The Williams vs. Rhodes case dealt with the right of
third parties to obtain ballot status in Ohio.

This case deals

with the right of independent candidates to obtain ballot status
in the State of Ohio.

^

We think the case itself raises two main issues.
first issue arises in this manner.

The

Ohio allows independent

candidates to secure ballot status through the filing of nomi­
nating petitions Signed by a certain number of qualified voters.
Now up to 1952 that number was 1 percent.
was 1 percent for 60-some years.

That number

In .1952 the amount was increase td

to 7 percent.
Nov; under the 1 percent rule which had existed for 60some years there was no substantial, no disruptive interference
2

1

with the election procedure by independents.

2

pation. by independents was slight, perhaps even minimi in the

3

Ohio election process.

4

Q

In fact, partici­

Was that 1 percent rule applicable across the

3

board to all independent candidates for any elective office in

6

the state?

A

7

8

sir, the 7 percent is likewise applicable across the board.
Q

9
10

Your client wanted to be an independent candidate

for election to the House of Representatives, is that it?

n
12

Yes, sir, that is my understanding and, in fact,

A

Yes, sir, that is correct, for the 21st Congres­

sional District, State of Ohio, November 1968 general, election.

13

How we say -that given that history of no disruption,

14

no substantial interference, no over-burdening of the election

15

process.

IS

a burden on First Amendment freedoms, a limitation of First

17

Amendment freedoms of association and speech and a burden on the

18

right to cast an effective ballot, to participate equally in the

IS

election process.

20

The seven-fold increase in the requirement constitutes

Now the second main issue we see arising is the barrier

21

itself.

In our case, for example, my roan, Mr. Brockington,

22

the appellant here, would have had to secure 5,974 valid signa­

23

tures to qualify for ballot.

24

will tell you, is get 59 percent more.

23

have had to obtain 9,000 signatures most likely, of which perhaps

Those are the two methods that Ohio

I think what we were concerned about, you said in

:sponse to Justice Stewart's question that he may have to get
majority in his primary.
h

My main ---

Q

Many thousands of votes.

A

My main responsa was that it might be thousands

votes, depending on the sise.

That changes it.

That is true,

I

he would have to prevail in the party primary.

2

mainly only to the size that might be required., because it might

3

be a small election district.

that.

5

Q

6

I was responding

That is what I meant when 1 said

Well, the party if it only puts up one candidate,

he doesn't have to go through a primary at all, does he?

7

A

I would assume that his name would be on the

8

ballot, that persons could cast write-in votes for other people

if they wanted to.

to

Q

How do you get on a primary ballot?

n

A

A primary ballot is secured one of two ways.

If

12

it is a less than statewide office

in other words, if it is

13

from a congressional district or something — you have to obtain

14

the signatures of 100 qualified voters.

15

Q

Of that party?

16

A

Of that party.

17

Q

Yes.

18

A

If it is for Senator, for instance, which would

19

be a statewide office, or Attorney General, you would have to

20

obtain 1,000 signatures of qualified voters of that party..
The difference with the independent, of course, is

21

22

that he must obtain a number equal to 7 percent of those people

23

who voted for Governor in the applicable district in the last

24

previous gubernatorial --q

25

Do you have any idea how often candidates are

1;

1

unopposed in a primary?

2

A

3

I would say that my feeling is not often, sir.

4

Q

S

No, sir, I don't.

As a general rule in the primary in Ohio is that

any significant office, thereis competition for it?

6

A

Yes, sir, I think that is so.

7

Q

This 7 percent requirement that you attack here —

a

A

Yes, sir.

9

Q

10

in any event, --

II

A

12

Q

13

which we now know has been reduced to 4, but

Yes, sir.
--- those can be signatures of members of the

Republican Party or of the Democratic Party or no party?

14

A

Yes, sir.

IS

Q

Or some other third party, is that correct?

16

A

That is iry understanding.

27

Q

It is not limited to people who have not voted in

18

party primaries, for example, is ha?

19

A

No, sir, he is not.

20

Q

The whole field is open to him as a registered

22

A

Yes, sir.

23

We think that no only through comparison of the dis­

24

proportion of 100 signatures, for instance approximately 6,000

of the 7 percent or now the 4 percent offends the equal protec­

tion clause and is violative of it, that the equal protection

3

clause in the election area deals with fundamental rights and

4

the classifications that might limit or restrict these rights are

5

carefully scrutinised and closely confined to whatever might

6

be determined to be the necessity of the case.

Now the particular facts in which this case arise

How my conclusion is they have not and for this rea­

That the 7 percent increase was patently uncon ills tut ional

and is unconstitutional and that the 4 percent requirement is

17

also unconstitutional.

system running without problems under a 1 percent requirement.

I say this for two reasons:

the 60-year history of an election

20

Q

Before you get to the merits,

21

A

Yes, sir.

22

Q

If you have mentioned the question of moofcness,

23
24
25

I have missed it.
A

I trust you will before you conclude this.

I would be happy to respond to that at this time,

Your Honor.

;U

5

It is true that the election is passed»

a

Q

Here I am looking at the relief you asked, at

3

page S of the appendix, was not for a declaratory judgment, but

4

this was an action mandamus in which you directed yourself to

5

getting your client on the ballot for a specific election, i.e.,

§

the election of November 5, 1968, and no other.
There is no request for general declaratory relief.

7

8

And I was wondering if quite apart from the fact that the

9

statute has now been amended to reduce the requirement from 7

10

percent to 4 percent, quite apart from that, I was wondering if

II

this isn't moot just by reason of the fact the relief that you

12

ask is now impossible to be accorded to you.

13

the election be set aside, or
A

14

No, sir.

You didn't ask that

I would hope not. Your Honor, and I

15

believe ifc should not be regarded as moot.

First of all, although

rule, not mandated necessarily by the Constitution, although per­
haps by the case in controversy ruled the Constitution.

But, in

any event, we have had in this case a case that was contested
through three lower courts as a completely adversarial proceed­
ing .

/

The appellees here were at every proceeding, filed

2

briefs, argued the case.

tested.

5

Q

I can assure you it was hotly con­

Mr. Sheerer, isn't at least a partial answer that

the Ohio Supreme Court did not treat this case as moot?

6

A

Yes, sir, I think —

7

Q

That it was not decided on the basis of remedy.

8

They got to the constitutional issue, didn't they?

9

A

1 believe they did, Your Honor.

10

Q

Well, as to the Ohio Suprema Court, and correct

11

me if I am mistaken, decided this before the election, for which

12

you asked relief?

13

A

Yes, that is correct.

14

Q

It obviously wasn't moot then.

13

Q

Did they decide the constitutional issue?

16

A

They did decide the constitutional issue, Your

17

Honor.

One of the appellees makes the suggestion that the dis­

18

missal there was because they couldn't grant relief.

19

that was so, I think they would have said so.

But if

They said that they found no substantial constitutional

20

issue involved.

21

I think it has been litigated and litigated

22 soundly on the merits of three courts below.
Secondly, I would like to point out that election
cases are treated differently, I believe, than other cases.

:ion cases are peculiarly difficult to get complete and adequate

z

They just are a fact of life.

Naturally the opponent

3

in an election case wants to delay, he wants to get the election

4

over, and so it is just almost impossible to get adequate and

$

complete review on these cases, and yet the question comes up

6

again.

7

now if this Court does not resolve it.

8
9

This is not a question that will be finally determined

Q

Are you suggesting that we now treat it as though

you had sought declaratory judgment?

to

A

Yes, sir, if that is possible.

n

Q

On what authority do you suggest we do that?

12

A

Well, sir, I don’t have specific authority as to

13

the capability of the Court to do that.

14

this not an unnecessary question.

15

come up again, and that the mere fact that we did not include

16

an allegation in the court below when this case was submitted

17

should not be determinative of this issue.

18

1 do say this:

That

It is a question that will

This is not an academic question, as I say.

It will

19

come up again.

£0

the courts have said that where it is a matter of great and pub"

21

lie importance, where it transcends the individual case, we will

zz

go ahead and decide this point for the benefit of the public to

23

preserve the electoral process, to enhance it, and the cases to

24

that effect are cited in our briefs, Your Honor.

25

Q

Election matters tend to recur, and many times

But, Mr. Sheerer, you have asked for mandamus
12

1

■that is an action at law?

2

A

Yes, sir,

3

Q

To enjoin the enforcement of the statute as an

4

equitable action?

•S

A

1 didn’t hear,

a

Q

To enjoin the enforcement of the statute would be

7

an equitable action,

8

A

Well, Sir, what we said —

9

Q

What do you want us to tell the Supreme Court of

10

Ohio, to grant mandamus?
A

It

We want tills Court to say, Your Honor, that the

12

courts below were in error, that they should have held that the

13

7 percent requirement was unconstitutional and that the 1 percent

!4

requirement was in effect.

Now what we are asking —

15

Q

You said that he should be put on the ballot?

IS

A

Yes, sir, that he should be -—

1?

Q

He should have been put on the ballot?

!8

A

That he should have been granted ballot status,

19

Q

Do you have any case that suggests that you can

20

do that in a mandamus action?

21

A

Well, sir, we do cite •—-

22

Q

You have made no effort to change the mandamus

23

action.

24

then o

25

You have got the same prayer now today that you had

A

Yes, sir, that is true.
13

However, the thrust of

t

our lawsuit is

2

Q

Sua sponte we could give it declaratory judgment?

3

A

Well, sir, the thrust of our lawsuit has always b< ie::~

4

that the 1 percent requirement was appropriate and the 7 percent

3

was not.

6

Q

What about one and a half?

7

A

Well, sir, we say this;

That the 60“year history

8

shows that it had been in existence for 60 years, that there was

9

no need for an increase.

Now X am not suggesting to the Court

10

that it sanctify or hold that the 1 percent requirement is con-

if

st.itution, because I don't think that is quite the issue here,

12

and X am not clear in jay own mind whether 1 percent could be said

13

to be constitutional.

14

Q

15

16

I presume somebody will have to decide that, may­

be like a Legislature, would it?
A

I am not asking the Court to substitute its judg­

17

ment for the Legislature here.

18

where there has been this type of history and no interference

19

or disruption, the Legislature cannot just increase — make

20

increases seven-fold, driving independents and minority parties

21

22
23
24
25

off the ballot.

What we are saying is this:

Thc.t

They cannot show a justification for this increase

■Now as to the validity of the 1 percent requirement
itself, I take it that could be the subject of litigation at somt
time if someone wanted to litigate it.
Q

What should we do about the statute on that?
14

1

A

I am not entirely clear on that# Mr. Justice.

2

Q

Now my next question was.going to ba, if it wasf

3

what was it for'?

4

A

Well, again I have to respond to ray historical

3

argument that it just was not great participation, that there

6

was hardly any independent activity and then to raise it seven­

7

fold just about ended independent activity, and also there was

8

a historical fact

9

Q

Well, you think 4 is equally infirm?

10

A

Yes, sir.

And of course if we cannot prevail

11

hare, I am sure the 4 percent statute is going to be the subject

12

of litigation.

13

like to avoid another long process of litigation when we think

14

the issues could not be presented any differently to this Court

IS

if it came back again.

Wa would like to avoid that if we could; wa would

I cannot conceive of the question being different at

m
n

all before this Court if it were brought back again.

I think

18

that exactly the same contending issues would be before the Court

19

if it carae back.

4

• b.

Q

Is there some contention that this man wants to

22

A

I am not clear, Your Honor, whether he will or not

,23

Certainly within the

24

Q

He might though.

25

A

Yes, sir, I think it is possible that he might.

He has had a taste of it and he wasn’t very successful.

Q

Has has had a taste of not running.

He was able to run as a write-in candidate, of

vs. Princess Anne, but I recall that that was a case in which

relief could not fee granted.

case as to whether or not that was declaratory judgment prayer

I believe it was an injunction

10

in that, I am not sure, but I do remember that was a case in which

n

it was a question considered of such public importance that this

12

Court decided it.

13

How in addition to the history which we believe is of

14

vital importance here, this Court has held in the area of the

15

election cases, 1 believe.

I believe there is nothing in the.

You thought 1 percent was all right?

Q

How dees this requirement compare to the require­

ments of other states as to independent candidates and to new

parties?

17

A

Very, very high.

You will remember in the foot­

19

states require 1 percent for third party --

21

£2

Q

Yes, I know, but that is a different situation,

A

Yes, sir.

isn't it?
But if they are only going to require

23

parties to require 1 percent and the party is a structure or an

24

organisation to obtain valid status, how much harder is it to

25

require 7 percent from an independent candidate?

The other states in our research are much lower.

No, sir, it is not.

ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. MACKLIN

S

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. MACKLINs

10
11

12

I am going

Mr. Chief Justice, may if please the

Court:
First of all, I would like to point out that the

13

appellees in this case have suggested the element of mootness in

14

this case and, of course, that is now pending for your decision.

15

We feel vary strongly, however, that in the event — in the

IQ

unhappy event this Court might want to rule upon the Constitu­

17

tionality of our election statute, which is. under consideration

18

here, we do recognize the fact that when the Court rules, it

19

affects whatever piece of legislation may then be in effect and,

20

consequently, we feel it would have an effect upon our 4 percent

21

statute which is going to be effective some eight days from todaj

22

on October 30th.

23

Notwithstanding we would like to ask for some sober

24

reflection on the basic law of this particular case.

25

lant initially came into the Trial Court seeking the extraordinaz
19

The appel­

1

remedy of a writ of mandamus to co-mand the respondent Board of

2

Elections and certain state officials to place his name on the

3

ballot as an independent candidate for election to Congress as

4

United States Representative from the 21th District in Ohio»

5

Mr. Brockington had failed at that time to comply with

6

the existing statute requiring that he file nominating petitions

7

signed by not less than 7 percent of the number of electors who

8

had voted for Governor in the next preceding general election

.2

in that district.

He had filed petitions which ware slightly

10

in excess of the 1 percent, which would have been the require­

11

ment under the former statute which preceded the 7 percent statute.

25

Mow in Ohio by statutory definition a writ of mandamus
commands the performance of an act which the law specially
enjoins as a duty resulting from the office of trust or station.
In addition, our state law places a burden on the relator to
establish a clear legal right to have the writ issued.
So implicit in Mr. Brockington*s suit was the require­
ment that he shew the unconstitutionality of the 7 percent
statute such that the Court would be correct in reinstating the
1 percent statute and, therefore, granting the writ of mandamus.
Now the record will show that at the Trial Court level
there was no evidence introduced supporting a contention of uncor
stitutionality of the 7 percent statute.

The essence of the

evidence was simply that Mr. Brockington had filed petitions
with signatures consisting of about 3 parcent rather than the

20

•i

requisite 7 percent, and that the respondent Board of Elections

2

has denied certification because of the insufficiency of petitio; i.
Nothing more.

3

This was the entire thrust of the evi­

4

dence which was heard at the Trial Court in Cuyahoga County in

5

Ohio.

6

rule in Ohio that an act of the General Assembly is presumed to

7

be constitutional and before a court may declare if unconstitu­

8

tional, it must appear beyond a reasonable doubt that, legisla­

9

tion and the constitutional provisions are clearly incompatible.

10

Absent an appearance of such incompatibility, the evi­

It was at that time,and for all I know it still is, the

11

dence of the record of this case, it was not unreasonable that

n

our State Court should find that no substantial constitutional

13

question existed.

14

IS
16
i7

S8
19

And rather than being an opaque determination in the
Trial Court, it was quite clear that the relator had not carried
the burden of showing that he had a clear legal right to remedy
which he asked for.
In Ohio the basic philosophy underlying the enactment
of the statute requiring indepedent candidates to support'their

20

candidacy with petitions subscribed by a certain percentage of

.21

electors, whether it be 1 percent, or 4 percent or 7 percent,

22

is that we feel that for the best exercise of the democratic

23

process and as a matter of principle, that a candidate for any

24

office be required to demonstrate that his is not the frivolous

25

injection of his personality into the publicity of a political
21

1

campaign, hut rather, in fact, that he is seeking election to

2

that office»

3

It is not unreasonable that he be required to show som-

4

marked demonstration of support from at least a fraction of the

S

electorate within the area from which he seeks election.

6

believe that such a requirement is necessary to establish a

7

bona fide pin on the part of the candidate.

Q

we are supported in our belief in the knowledge that some 42

0

sister states have some form of similar requirement in either

10

n

We

In this respect,

greater or lesser degree.
In actual fact, I believe there are 11 other states

12

which now would require a greater degree of percentage than does

13

Ohio in view of its 4 percent statute coming up.

14

Q

Are there any which don't have any requirement?

15

A

There are five states which don't have any require

16

menfc at all, Mr. Justice Harlan.

17

Q

Do you remember which ones they are?

18

A

I can tell you, yes.

There are no provisions in

1,9

Hawaii, Delaware, in Florida, Michigan and Mississippi.

20

that is according to our research.

And

21

Q

No provisions for independent candidates?

22

A

No provisions for coming up with a requirement of

23

a certain percentage of electors to sign the petitions for nomi­

24

nation, Your Honor.

25

Q

Do they have a provision for. independent candidates
22

1

those states?

a

A

Will you please repeat that?

3

Q

Bo they have a provision for independent candi-

4

iatss in those states?
A

S

I am quite sure they do, Your Honor, but we only

6

Looked at this from the standpoint of whether or not there was

7

> percentage requirement in the course of our research.

S

Q

Is that material in your brief?

9

A

No, it is not, sir.

10

Q

Mr. Macklin, why the change from 1 to 7?

n

A

1 don't really know, Your Honor.

This was estab-

i

'52

Lished by the Legislature.

I do-think that the appellant case

13

Indicates a long history of a very comfortable arrangement with

14

:he 1 percent requirement.

15

:hat

16

i?ith a 1.5 percent, with a 4 percent, with a 7 percent?

I think it is conjectural.

1 think

we might very well ask what might the history have been

q

17

l have, great difficulty because I would assume

18

In SO years that the 1 percent would be much more than it was 60

m

fears ago, because I assume the population of Ohio has increased.

20

[ assume that.

21

A

Yes, Your Honor.

22

0

So with the population increase and with more sig­

23
24

25

natures required, why would you raise the percent?

That is my

problem.
A

Well, 1 can only suggest that this was within the

23

t

sole area of the Legislature at that time.

2

have taken another iodk at it, they have reduced it to 4 percent

3

and perhaps they have looked at other states and seer, what they

4

have, but I think it is purely a matter for the discretion of

5

the Legislature and in this case that is what they did exercise.

8

Q

However, since they

There is no way to get at what we call the legis­

7

lative history in that change in 1952 from 1 percent to 7 per­

8

cent.

Are there no committee reports?
A

9

No, Your Honor, there are not.

We locked for

to

this.

n

the deliberations are not now set out as they ware formerly in

tz

1852.

13

We looked at newspapers and everything else.

As you know.,

We believe the requirement of showing some bona fide

14

intent on the part of the candidate really to be in the best intc r

15

est of the voter and quite frankly we believe it to fce supportive

16

of the one-man, one-vote principle in that the. voter is assured

17

when he casts his vote for a candidate who is qualified, his vote

13

will be an effective expression of a preference for a candidate,

19

and the vote could be undiluted in its relationship to all other

20

votes cast since he will have voted in behalf of the candidate

21

of .proven intent.

22

Now we freely admit thatour statutes do distinguis! •

23

between the independent candidate and the candidate who is run­

24

ning for a party nomination.

As point out previously, I believe,

25 OC believe a party candidate is required only to have 100
24

1

signatures on his ballot, but we consider that the reason for

2

this decision lies in the difference in the path of the party

3

candidate must follow as opposed to the independent candidate.

4

The party candidate is put to great time, expense; moreover,

5

he lists his principles on the line on the issues which may be

■$

before the people at that time, and certainly in Ohio party

7

primary fights are a very difficult time for the candidates.

8
9

We feel that to prescribe a parity between an independent and party candidates, in effect, would be discriminatory

10

as to the party candidates in this instance.

11

really the issue that has been raised in this case, because the

12

appellant certainly in his briefs openly subscribes to the 1

13

percent requirement and this of itself is a greater demand of

14

the independent than it would be of the party candidate.

13

But this is not

His only complaint lies with the degree of the burden

IS

that may be cast upon theindependent candidate, and he really

17

fails to tell us what increment beyond 1 percent triggers off

18

the avalanch of unconstitutional invalidity.

19

He would ask this Court to determine some magic figure

20

of percentage and to impose upon the State of Ohio and quite

21

clearly the other states would be affected by this, this Court's

22

ideas of what thatpolicy might -be .

23

We submit that the appellant has not offered guidlines.

24

There are no clear or valid criteria which have been presented

25

to this Court which might establish a basis for determining some
25

f

5

magic percentage.

Q

What is the state interest precisely that you are

A

The state interest, Mr, Justice, ——

5

Q

In 4 percent or 1 percent or 7 percent?

6

A

Mr. Justice Harlan, the state interest that we

w

serving?

7

feel is as far as we can say a compelling state interest is

8

simply that we are requiring that an independent candidate show

9

that he has'a valid intent to actually run and' that he does have

10

the support of at least a fraction of the electorate in further­

n

ing his candidacy.

12

Q

9

A

To go on, we submit that the determination of

to

requirements to qualify an independent candidate for certifica­

n

tion on the ballot ought properly to be left 'to the discretion

12

of the Legislature with the knowledge of local conditions and
