The facts of this case involve relatively ordinary
eviction action which was commenced in July, 1967.

After

pleadings were filed and defenses were raised and in fact,
seven special defenses were raised as to the eviction actions
that was brought.
In January of 1968 the trial took place; on Januarv
16 judgment was handed for the landlord, the Housing Authority *
i

of West Haven.

Therafter, on January 18 our appeal from that

judgment was filed with fee Appellate Division.

At that time, .

pursuant to Section 52542 of the Connecticut General Statutes,
it was required that we file with the Court a bond with a

2

3

surety to cover the rents that might accrue during the pendency

2

of the appeal»

3

our clients, we went to several surety companies, asking them

4

what they would require to go on the bond as a surety.

5

bond in this case, because the rent was $72 a month, would

6

have been approximately something in the nature of $400, $5.

And in order tofile that bond on behalf of

The

I

7

8
9

or even more dollars.for this bond.
In fact, the case that we cited in our brief in
which the rent was approximately the same as our rent, the

10

Trial Court had ordered that a bond in the amount of $700 be

n

filed in that particular case.

12

bonds would have been something in the nature of $500 to

13

And this again, is to cover the rents that would accrue durincr j

14

the pendency of the appeal.

15

So that, in any event, all
'i
$700 j

The surety companies that we approached, asking them;
..

16

that they go on this bond, demanded full cash collateral before

17

they would sign a bond, as well as demanding their fee.

IS

was impossible for our clients to pay; they were poor and they

19

didn’t have thatkind of money.

20

This

I.

So, we went to the Trial Court and by motion on our

21

clients' behalf, to waive the surety bond,

22

facts to the Trial Court and asked that as an alternative in

23
24
23

I

we stated these

order to protect the landlord during the pendency of the appeal
that we be allowed to pay the rent into the Court every month
to be held by theCourt in escrow and we also agreed in the
3

1

1

event we should lose the appeal and ultimately if the Supreme

2

Court of Connecticut, heard it, and lose there, that this money

3

then would be turned over to the landlord.

4

if in any one month we failed to pay that rent into the court

S

that the appeal could automatically be dismissed.

6

We also agreed that

Now, we thought this was a fair alternative because

7

the interest that the state has in protecting the’ landlord

8

would be met entirely by this provision; by this alternative

9

that we offered.

If we paid the rent every month as it came

10

due, and if we failed any one month and our appeal would then

II

be dismissed, the landlord would then have all the protection

12

that he would be entitled to.

13

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Is it clear, Mr. Dineen,

14

that the Court had the power, by/ way of equity discretion or

15

some other source to waive the bond requirement and accept

16

your alternative proposal?

17

MR. DINEEN:

Your Honor, it appears to us that it is

18

clear that they did not have that discretion.

1©

say that, we cited in our appendix the Appellate Court decision

20

and on Page 57 of the appendix where we cited the decision,

2!

the Court says, "The right here to an appeal is .not a constitu­

22

tional one, though one based upon privileges of natural justice..

23

It is but a statutory privilege in which the aggrieved party

24

has the right to avail himself of only when he has strictly

25

complied with the provisions of the statutes."

4

The reason I

i

And later,, on Page 60 of the appendix the Anne liate

2

Division says, "want of bond with surety, where bond with

3

surety is by statute a prerequisite of review, furnishes a

4

sufficient ground for dismissal of the appeal„

5

We made the motion in the Trial Court because there

6

had not been a decision such as this with regard to waiving a

7

surety bond prior to this time.

8

felt we were offering a fair ,alternative.

9

our understanding now of the Appellate Division's decision,

Now, we made it because we
It turned out, from

10

that the Appellate Division decides that it does not have the

11

power to waive.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

What did you sav the suit was

filed for?

U

MR. DINEEN:

This is an eviction action, Your Honor.

IS

MR. JUSTICE BLACK: For nonpayment of rent?

16

MR. DINEEN:

Well, there were two actions.

The

17

action that we3 re concerned with was based on nonpayment of

18

rent.

19
20
21

Prior to that -MR.JUSTICE BLACK:

And you offered to oav the money

into Court?
MR. DINEEN: We offered to pay the money to the Court

22.

at the time of the appeal.

23

from July, 1967 until the,..time of judgment, to January of 5 68 ,

Now —

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Was there any defense?

MR. DITTEEN:

Yes,, there was, Your Honor.

There were

defenses on the merits that no rent was due.

claim that the landlord, the Housing Authority had not complied

with Connecticut statutes and this is set forth as well on

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

PAR. DIHEEN:

Our defense all
One was that we

What Connecticut statutes?

There are Connecticut statues that re­

quire that any building that is considered a tenement house or

10

a garden-type apartment and these are defined in Connecticut

11

statutes, must have what is called a "tenement house certifi­

12

cate," stating that that building complies precisely with the

13

tenement house laws.

14

15

And if it does not have a tenant house

certificate then no rent is due and under a case cited, I
believe in our jurisdictional statement, Dreamy Hollow Apart- '

16

ments against Lewis, no special proceeding or summary process

17

action can be brought when such a house does not have this

tenement house certificat.

25

Thatwas one of our defenses as to

It was the second defense, and thatrelates to the
first action that was brought.

There was an action brought song

two or three months before this second action, which is an
issue here -- that was brought in early May.

It was an effort

bythe landlord to put ihgg® peopl§ out for another reason.

It

is our contention that under Connecticut lav? that once a first
5

action is brought there is no more obligation on the Dart of

2

the tenant to pay rent to the .landlord»

15

17

That would pay it off?

MR. DINEEN: I beg your pardon* Your Honor?

12

16

We had offered to pay rent every month

from the time of the appeal. The point I am trying to make is

11

14

Did I understand you to say awhile

ago you had offered to pay rent plus the costs?

I beg your pardon - Your Honor»

MR.JUSTICE BLACK:

But yon offered to pay the rent

But would, it pay the back rent?

It would not pay the back rent, Your
■

I

Honor.
Now, as to' that question that is no requirement in
Connecticut law that in order to defend or to litigate in a
summary’’ process action that you have to pay any rent.

In fact, j

23
24

generally when a summary process action is commenced, the
landlord will refuse to take any rent, because this would be a

25

7

1

waiver, probably of his action»

2

Litigating and defending an eviction action is not

3

conditioned in Connecticut, upon paying current rent»

4

Connecticut' lav? does not require that? and this particular

5

factor, we don't feel is relevant to the case.

0

the fact that for several months, from July until January rent

7

was not paid, is not relevant to the issues we present to this

8

Court.

In other words.

9

I£ we paid the rent in full every month as we went

10

along during the litigation, we still would have come to the

11

same problem that we ccihe to here.

12

time of appeal where we would have had to put up the bond with

13

the surety.

14

put up a lump of money covering perhaps some six or seven or

15

eight months rent.

raised by this case, would have been raised even if every montl

we had been paying the rent to the landlord or into the Court

18

during the litigation.

We would have come to the

And so, the precise same issue that's

But we had defenses, up until, the time --

20

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

24

25

What did you say your second

defense was?
MR. DINEENs

The first was that there wasn't any

tsmemSRt house certificate.

The second was that there had beer,

a prior action brought which terminates any obligation ontthe
part of the tenant to pay rent to the landlord.

Once the

l

landlord commences an eviction action, he waives his right to

collect rent and his effort to terminate the - lease —

Waives his right to collect

rent?
MR.DXNEEN:

To collect rent as such, Your Honor.

He

still is entitled to collect whatever the reasonable value of

the premises are? but this would be a separate natter.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

Nonpayment of rent: that's

what this action was for.
MR. DIMEEN:

4

It was for a specific month, which wah

5

back in the month of Hayf which was what they were claim!no.

e

What I am saying is if we were payinn during the course of

7

litigation that would not have affected the Court's judgment.

8

At the time of judgment, even though we ware paid uo and were

9

current, we still would have faced this appeal bond, which says

10

if you want to appeal you have to put un a bond with surety to

11

cover the rents that will accrue.

12

at that time we would have to get a surety.and pay him, sav,

five months in advance, or whatever it would be that we would
put down in the bond; say, five hundred dollars.in advance and

even if you were current and had no arrears, we would still, in
order to meet this appeal bond, have to have our tenants nut
up $500 then and there, which they couldn't afford.

Mb. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Mr. Dineen, let me see if
I can get one thing clear.

There were findings here and then

10

there is some colloquy in the ecord which seemed to explain

11

the findings and I am not sure in which action this took place;

12

the finding I am referring to is the finding of the trial

13

judge in the court in the first instance that this appeal was

14

taken for purposes of delay and not in good faith.

15

you challenge those findings?

16

MR. DINEEN:

TIow, do

Yes, we did challenge those, Your Honor.

i

\7

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, now — let's assume

13

first that you are right, and that the findings are in error;

19

do we review a findina of the court of the first instance of

20

states on a factual issue in which undoubtedly/ credibility and

21

similar factors are —
MR. DINEEN:

22

No, Your Honor.

My contention as to

23

that, as well, is that that finding is irrelevant to this

24

appeal.

25

of delay relates only to a stay of execution.

That findina that the appeal was taken for the purpose

13

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: But does that not also

i
2

relate %’feether a bond would be accepted under any circumstance|?

3

MR. DITTEEN* Ho, Your Honor, because as I understand

4

the Appellate Division decision there is no discretion in the

3

court to waive the bond.

6

we were appealing for delay, or not to delay, but were appeal­

7

ing in good faith, whatever the. trial court may have found,

8

he still doesn't have the discretion to waive that bond.

9

requires a bond and failure to put up a bond snakes us subject

In other words, even it they thought

He

10

then to a motion to dismiss the appeal.

11

the finding that the appeal was taken for the purpose of delay

12

is not relevant to the questions before this Court, because

13

that only relates to- the stay of execution.
The Appellate Division’s decision in this matter,

14
15
16
17

Our feeling is that

When they dismissed the appeal and denied our motion to review,
says nothing about any delay; it simply says that we failed to
put up a. bond, and that the bond Xi?as required.

The aopeal was

18

dismissed because we didn't put up the bond and the bond was

19

not waived because there was no authoritv in the court to waive

20

the bond.

21

22
23
2/i

25

Any question of delay, which we did discute all
along, even assuming that there were delay involved and that
the finding of the trial court were correct, is not relevant
to this appeal.

The only thine that's relevant, as we see it,

is the surety bond which requires, in effect, that an advance

14

j
.

?

be made on the rent in lump sum for some five or six months.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN-.'

2

Now, that would depend a good

3

deal on whether you approached this issue as involving the

4

statute on its face or the statute as applied.

5

that it is a matter of Federal Constitutional law a state

6

couldMnot insist upon security pending appeal in a situation

7

where it made a determination that the appeal was frivolous,

8

harrassing, taken for the purposes of delay? are youarguing

9

that?

10

MR. DINEEN?

11

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

12

MR. DINEEN:

A.re you arguin<

I am not arguing that. Your Honor.
I didn't think so.

Under Connecticut law the question of

13

delay or frivolity doesn't relate to your being entitled to

14

appeal.

15
16

17
18
19
20

What we are questioning is when there is the right to

appeal that’s available to everyone, but is conditioned on the
postinggof this bond, which requires that you, in effect, put
up several months rent in advance, that that is unconstitutional
because it deprives; it’s unconstitutional, we claim, for
several reasons, both it denies equal protection of the law and
it denies due process.

In addition to the zealous legal representation

have had the benefit of extensive briefs by their attorneys and
also by several organizations who have filed amici curiae
briefs in this Court.

The question presented by the Appellant's appeal
33

is whether the surety bond requirement of 52-542 of the

2

Connecticut General Statutes, on an appeal in a summary process

3

action is violative of the

4

Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause»

4th Amendment to the United States

The Connecticut summary process statute was initially

5
6

adopted in

806»

Prior to that time if a landowner desired to

7

oust a tenant of por. ession, he was required to file an action

8

in ejectment in the courts, which was a slow and expensive

8

procedure.

10

The purpose of the summary process statute was to
I
give the company owner an alternate means of recovering

11

possession of his property from the tenant who was either

12

unable:or unwilling to pay his rent.

3

I want to emphasise that the Connecticut Summary

14

Process Statute is not a statute of general application.

15

applicability is limited to those cases where there is a lease

6

which has terminated, either by time or nonpayment of rent, or

7

where there is occupation, without right or privilege.

It’s

I also want to emphasise that the property owner

utilising the summary process procedure, does not recover rent.

That passage, as Mr. Justice

MR. AHERN:

I think this is where the Appellants and

a

the Housing Authority disagree, whether or not the surety bond

3

in all cases must accompany an appeal.

Certainly, since it is

10

for the sole protection of the landlord, the landlord could

waive the surety bond requirement, we feel.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

Could the Court waive — could

assumes that waiver of surety bond was permissible if the
appeal was in good faith?

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL: But the problem I really have

is.why the argument is made by the Appellate that the court

MR. JUSTICE MARSHAL:

Well, do you agree that "shall5

means that?
MR. AHERN:

I think it means "shall" unless the court

21

feels that there are equitable considerations that should be

22

takdn into consideration by the court? either the court can use

23
24
25

!

its good offices to have the landlord waive the surefcv bond
requirement, which I think could be done, because the sole pur­
pose of the surety bond is to protect the landlord's interest.

circumstances in the particular case warranted, it could waive

The only Connecticut authority,

17

I guess, is the Appellate Division's opinion in this case;

18

isn't it?
MR, AHERN:

19
23

It's breaking new ground, Mr. Justice

Stewart, I believe.
The West Haven Housing Authority, as I stated earlier,

21
i

22

is a Federal and State instrumentality.

derived from the tenant rentals is used to meet its obligations;

2

to bondholders and to continue to meet the normal operating

3

expanses of the Authority.»

4

In defending the summary process action in the trial

5

court the Appellants advanced seven special defenses, all of

6

which were procedural? and all of which were consider'd by the

7

trial»court and evidently considered meritless.

/

8

It is obvious from the reading of the first special
; i

3

defensi, and the trial brief that the reason the Appellants,

10

the tenants, determined to withhold payment of rent from the

11

Authority was that they were miffed because of the previous

12

summary process action instituted by the Authority which was

13

not prosecuted to effect.

14

The trial court in entering judgment for possession

15

of the premises, expressly found that the Appellants had not

18

paid rent for a period of eight months from April 1967 through

1?

December of 1967, which was immediately prior to the trial

to a summary proceeding where the process is abused by dilatory

tactics, defense is interposed to delay or obstruct the pro­

24

ceeding, and every effort made to delay a trial of the ease on

25

the merits."

That can be found inthe record appendix at Page 5,
42

1

Just three days after the above decision was rendered

by the trial court, that is on January 19, i960, the same

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The trial judge seems to

22

have, at least given some consideration to the idea that if he

23

first found that the appeal was taken in good faith and not for

24

purposes of delay, than he would consider the question, the

25

question of the alternative of paying the rent into the court.

45

At the top of Page 22 in your appendix it says: "If they can",

Z

referring to the execution and the stay, "then I won’t give

any further thought to the alternative plan of substituting

didn't approach that question?

of the trial court that the action was instituted for purposes

of delay.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

IQ

ray count here, the ferial judge refers permanently and rather

17

vigorously at times, fee the reasons why he thought this appeal

was taken for purposes of delay, but as Justice Douglas pointed

out, the Appellate Division never mentioned that.

right?

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

Is that what you are going to

10

do?

11

this opinion as not addressed only to whether the anneal had

12

to be dismissed for want of filing a bond, but also that the

13

opinion addresses itself to whether or not a stay was properly

14

denied because the appeal was taken in bad faith? is that

15

right?

IS
\7

18

In other words you are telling us that we ought to read

MR. AHERN:

That-is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: All right.
MR. AHERN:

Certainly the plight of the indigent

19

tenants who are unable to pay their bills elicits the sympathy

20

and compassion of all peoples? hewevo? we submit that some

2t

sympathy and compassion should be reserved for the real

22

property owner who must meet his mortgage obligations and otheit

23
24
25

financial obligations or risk the loss of his property.

All

landlords are not weal'dy? and all tenants are not indigent.
And most property owners cannot afford the luxury of a tenant
4.7

'1

who is either unwilling or unable to pay his rent.

2

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: I suppose this Housing

3

Authority, like most public housing authorities, has a waiting

4

list of other poor people who are, or claim to be, eligible

S

for occupancy here?

6

Is there a showing in the record on that?

MR. AHERN: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know whether

7

the record shows it, but certainly I think the Court could

8

take judicial notice of the fact that there aren't sufficient

9

housing accommodations for the poor and that there would be a

m

list of people waiting? and further take notice of the fact

11

that the Housing Authority depends on the tenants' payment of

12

monthly rents in order to meet its obligations to bondholders

13

arid itsfinancial obligations in the continuing operation of the

H

Authority.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL:

15

I still have great difficulty

16

on landlord law, when they paid this $72 a month into court.

17

It's all the landlord was entitled to; it was, in court and

18

anybody- that failed to pay it, they lost everything.

19

MR. AHERN: Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I think the

20

record will show that the offer to make payment in the court

Z\

was made at the time that the hearing was held on the motion tc

22

waive surety bond which was nine months after they stopped pay-

23

ing rent.

24

not the back nine months which they had not paid.

25

The offer was to pay current rent into the court;

MR.. JUSTICE MARSHALL:

48

Well, then, am I wrong that at

1
**)

that stage if they put up a surety bond they didn't have to
pay that nine months behind ? did they?

3
4

MR. AHERN:

Not in a summary process action.

A

separate action would have had to been brought by the landlord
MR. JUSTICE MARSHAL:

S

Well, that's what I'm saying,

6

as of this the alternative was the surety bond, or $72 a month

7

into court.

8

MR. AHERN:

That's correct, Tour Honor.

9

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL:

And it was solely for the

to

protectionof the landlord; and why did he have to have that

it

surety bond when he was assured of his rent?

12

MR. AHERN:

Why would he have to?

$72 a month.
I believe the

x*1 .
13

reason 'the court would not accept the recommendation of the

14

attorneys for the Appellants was the fact. — and I think the

IS

court asked the direct question of the attorneys, whether they

would make paymentsof the nine months in the arrears, and they

No, it would not.
Well, so far as that par­

ticular point, the nine months arrears, was out of the picture,,

i
MR. AHERN: Well, I think this all comes into the
fact that the trial judge found that there were dilatory

tactics assd, because normally a summary process action takes

considerably less than seven months to have a hearing on the

merits»

Actually, Mr, Ahern, is the

action of the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court of

any light on the fact of the question of Mr, Justice Douglas
