ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. QUINN

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. QUINN;

7

8
9

We will hear arguments in

Mr. Chief Justice? may it please the

Court:
This matter is here on appeal from an interlocutory

10

order of the United States District Court for the District

11

of Massachusetts under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1253.

12

provides for direct appeal from an order or judgment of a

13

three™judge court granting temporary injunctive relief against,

14

enforcement of a state statute.

Tnat

15

Q

Future enforcement.

18

A

That is correct, You?.* Honor.

17

In our view this appeal presents two equally important

13

issues which ought to be finally resolved by this Court.

19

first is whether the court below abused its discretion in

20

enjoining the district attorney from prosecuting in the future

21

on account of the showing of the film, "I Am Curious Yellow,"

22

which the court below assumed to be obscene.

23

The

The second is whether under this Court5s holding in

24

Stanley vs. Georgia any state can constitutionally prohibit

25

public, commercialized dissemination of pornographic matter,
3

i

absent distribution to minors,, to non-consenting adults, or

2

by pandering,,
0

3
4

What is there in Stanley that protects commercial

distribution?
A

3

That is not the way we read it, Your Honor, and

6

I do not think that is the way the author of the opinion wrote

7

it.

8

Q

Thank You»

9

Q

If you prevail on the first point, why do we get

10

to the second at all?

11

A

I think it is significant to get to the ssscond

12

point for the same reasons stated by my brother, the distin­

13

guished Assistant Attorney Genereil from Texas, in the immed­

14

iately prior argument, Your Honor.

15

Q

And yet, as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out,

16

if we sustain you on the first point, why should we go in

17

ourselves and say that we will do what we said the lower court

10

shouldn't do?

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

And then we would interfere with the state

prosecution.
A

I submit, respectfully, Your Honor, that, there

exists now a great deal of confusion.
Q

I know that, but you have to argue these cases

on some kind of principle and not just because it is nice to
have a little certainty.
A

I submit, Your Honor, that -the principles exist.

4

1

in Roth vs. the United States and. the opinions following that

z

and also in Stanley vs» Georgia.

3

Q

Then it will get here through the state vehicle.

4

A

That is correct, Your Honor, but in 'the mean time

5

we submit that there exists a great deal of confusion and a

6

chilling effect among law enforcement officials as far as the

7

degree to which, they can go

8

Q

9

A

10

Q

11

That is a switch.
■—-> in reading the statute.
Tell me, what is the standing of — There has

already been a conviction I understand, is that right?

12

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

13

Q

Of tills distributor, Mr. Karalexis?

14

A

Yes, sir.

15

Q

And there v/as some tiling about some delay in

18

the hearing of the appeal, which is in the Supreme Judicial

17

Court, is that it?

!8

A

That is correct.

Our understanding, Your Honor,

19

is that tine bill of exceptions was entered in the Massachusetts

20

Supreme Judicial Court yesterday.

21

Q

So in the ordinary course, will there be oral

22

argument in that case?

23

A

24
25

In the ordinary course there would be oral

argument and, very likely,

in the October sitting of the

court, because it is too late for this argument to reach the

5

1
2

May sitting,
Q

That is what 1 was trying to get to.

So we

3

won’t have a decision which goes to the constitutionality of the

4

statute, will we?

5

A

I submit the decision would go to the constitu­

€

tionality of the statute as well as to the question of obs­

7

cenity vel non,

a
9

Q

But we probably wouldn’t get that from your high

court until December, January, maybe?
That is a fair assumption, Your Honor,

10

A

11

I would add, parenthically, that if there had been

12

all haste in the preparation of the bill of exceptions so that

13

it might be entered by the court, it is very likely that this

14

case would have been argued in the state court at next week’s

15

scheduled arguments in the May sitting.

16

The facts may be stated, briefly, as follows;

On

17

June 30, 1969, after preliminary proceedings not relevant

18

here, appellees filed an amended complaint in the court beloisf

19

alleging reason to believe that indictments would be sought

20

against them by appellant Byrne’s office under Massachusetts

21

21
23
24
25

General Laws, Chapter 272, Section 28a„
Shortly thereafter, the indictments ware, in fact,
sought and returned.
Q

This was after tills suit was filed?

A

That is correct, Your Honor.
6

After -the suit -was

1

filed but before there was any action taken.

2

respectfully, there was a bit of a race to the courtroom doors

3

to courts involved.

4

If I may say,

Appellees sought a declaration that the statute
4

5

is unconstitutional and an injunction against prosecution

6

thereunder.

7

among other things, adequately controlled commercial distri­

8

bution of obscene material is protected by the First Amendment.

9

They alleged 'the statute was overbroad, because,

The court declined to grant injunctive or other

10

relief but requested briefs on questions regarding the scop®

1!

of this Court’s holdings in Stanley vs. Georgia and the effect:

12

of that opinion on the Massachusetts statute,,
Prosecution continued in the state court in a jury-

t3
14

waived session, and. the appellees: were convicted.

15

their conviction, appellees renewed their request for injunctive

16

relief.

17

Following

After further argument a majority of the court

18

below held that Stanley vs. Georgia went so far as to prohibit

19

state prosecutions with respect to adequately controlled public

20

distribution of obscene material.

21

the Massachusetts statute was, probably, unconstitutional as

22

being overbroad on its face.

And the court decided that

23

Based on this opinion a majority of the court below

24

enjoined the appellants from further prosecution with respect

25

to showing of the film, "I Am Curious Yellow."
7

I address myself first to the question whether the

1
2

court below abused its discretion in granting injunctive

3

relief.

4

extremely reluctant to enjoin good-faith enforcement of a

5

state's criminal laws by law enforcenent officials.

Comity and federalism prompt a federal judge to be

Q

S

In the application of that was there any

7

significance in the fact that 'the proceeding had been brought

8

before the actual criminal prosecution was initiated?

©

A

I respectfully submit no, Your Honor.

10

Q

Haven't we made the distinction?

11

A

That is correct, Your Honor, you have, and the

12

Congress has legislated a distinction in that respect, but I

13

respectfully submit that what wa have here —- in the facts that

14

I .suggested were not relevant to the facts present -- what we

15

have here really was the seeking of an indictment before any

18

approach to the federal court.

17

tly, .dismissed in the judgment of the district attorney,

18

because there was lacking scienter in terms of the indictment.

The district attorney then in the normal course

21

all the proper elements of the kind so that there would not be a

That simply stating that they own a movie house and

that they are shewing or they might want to show a particular

We have

here activity,whose dominant theme, by assumption and by a

6

finding on the facts after a state trial, is offensive to

7

community standards of morality, whose appeal is to a prurient

8

interest in sen, whose content is utterly without redeeming

9

social value.

10

Furthermore, there is no bad faith whatsoever,

11

either evident on the record or argued in the court below,

12

on the part of the prosecution or law enforcement officials.

13

This has been — excepting the incident that I related to

5

Q

Why should you not be content to stop at that

A

Why should I not be content, to stop at that

6

point?

7

8

point, Mr. Justice Harlan?

9

that there must be some consideration given by this distinguis

10

hed Court to the aspect in which our complete American society

11

finds itself as far as the issue of obscenity.
Q

12

1 think, as I have stated before,

If you are right in what you just 'told us,

13

then it would be quite wrong for this Court in this case at

14

this time to give that sure guidance that you feel so much the

15

need of.
A

16

I submit, Your Honor, that it is not without

17

precedent that this Court has made distinctions and has made

18

findings as far as the procedure in cases like this, where it

19

rendered what appeared to be sufficient decision on one part

20

of a case to eliminate consideration of the second part, but

21

then want on in its judgment for proper interpretation of the

22

law

23

to considering a second point.

Q

Of course, there is nothing wrong and nothing

24

impermissible about your making alternative arguments, but if

2.5

you do prevail on this argument you just made to us, then thafc

Let

put a practical question to you, and

12

in effect, is the chilling effect on you prosecutors, you

13

state prosecutors, of the confusion -chat, manifestly exists

14

under this Court's decisions in this whole obscenity field.

13

Nobody can belie that.

16

Now, as between that and as between the proposition

17

that you just argued ~ namely, the implications of federalism

18

that go into federal courts, not getting into re-straining

19

state enforcement authorities from proceeding to enforce their

20

own laws and letting individual constitutional questions come

21

up through the state system — which do you think, if you had

22

to look at this from the two countervailing chilling effects

16

This is cf extreme importance to all of us because

And, it is that point

I

I go now to another factor relied on in the majority

23

opinion below, because it leads to the second question presented

24

.n our case here.

25

>£ success for the appellees here in their posture on the. facts

That court gave great weight to the likelihood

15

•I
2
3

That success depends on the answer to the question, "Can public
commercial dissemination of pornography be proscribed by any
State?"

4

Before Stanley vs. Georgia, we submit there was no

5

doubt at all about this principle»

S

leading caee on this subject based that answer on the fact that

7

obscenity is not protected speech within the First Amendment.

8

We agree with Mr. Justice Marshall that the holding in Stanley

§

in no way impairs the principle so well annunciated in Roth.

10

Roth vs. United States, the

In fact, only last week this Court summarily affirmed

11

in Gable vs. Jenkins, No. 1049 on the Docket of the Court, a case;

12

involving action under a distinguishable statute in the same

13

jurisdiction as Stanley, distinguishable from the statute in

14

the Stanley case, but a statute very much like that upheld in

8

I am aware that the Solicitor General is going to take

9

some time of the. Honorable Court and will dwell exclusively on

SO

the issue of obscenity and the relationship between the Roth

ii

decision and those following it in Stanley vs. Georgia.

12

So, I will conclude submitting that for all of the

13

foregoing and for the reasons brought forth in our brief we

14

submit that the court below abused its discretion in granting

15

relief and should be reversed on that instance.

16

We also submit that the right to prohibit obscenity,

57

that right annunciated in Roth, and the right to possess obscene

18

matter in the privacy of one's home, that right protected in

19

Stanley, are compatible as this Court has held.

We ask this Honorable Court so to hold and add again,

Q

Yes, but what I ain getting at is if one element

of the crime is that whatever you are examing has no redeeming
\
social value, how can any man who handles literature of any kind
know whether he is violating it or not?
A

It is extremely difficult to do so, Your Honor,

and this is another reason why further clarification of the
distinctions made by this Court would be helpful to all of us
who are in society and in law enforcement.
Q

DO you suppose that an addendum to that answer

would be that the States did not make that standard but they have
to try to live with it.
Q

But if the Federal constitution requires that no

man be convicted of a crime unless it is accurately described so
15
16

that he can know whether he is violating the law, that is a
State problem and a Federal problem, isn't it?

And if he cannot

17
18
19

20
21

be convicted if the test is each time whether it has a redeem­
ing social value, is that to be proven by evidence, is it to be
proven by and tried by the jury or is it to be tried by this
Court ultimately?

Can a man ever know whether it has redeeming

social value until his particular case gets up here?
22
A

I must answer in the affirmative to all of those

23

disjunctives, Your Honor.

‘There is an evidentiary problem in

24

determining obscenity or not.

this is established is extremely difficult X am sure for the

court as well as for individual lay people, citizens of the

13

United States of .America.

17

Q

I suppose that you would say that even in the

constitution life is not without its hazards.

18

A

Well stated, Your Honor.

19

Q

Life would have its hazards, but under the con­

20

stitution everybody has supposed I thought up to now in the

21

discussion of obscenity no man could be convicted of a crime un­

22

less it could be defined in such a way that he could know whethe:*

23

he is violating the law.

24

A

That is correct. Your Honor.

ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS X. BEYTAGH, JR., ESQ., ON BE-

10

OF THE UNTIED STATES A3 AMICUS CURIAE

It

MR. BEYTAGH:

32

He has to

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
At the outset, I should like to indicate as our amicus

13
14

brief shows and as Attorney General Quinn has pointed out, the

15

interest of the United States in this case is limited to that

16

aspect of the District Court’s decision that considered and in­

17

terpreted

18

therefore, take no position on the procedural issues that was

19

also involved in this case and has been the subject of extensive

20

briefing and argument by the party.

21

this Court's holding in Stanley vs, Georgia.

We,

I should like also to note the reasons for the Govern­

22

ment’s interest in this case.

As the Court: well knows, the

23

Federal Government, as well as the States, has laws that, bear upon

24

the matter of obscenity.

25

obscene materials and the. Federal Government again through a

The Government bans the importation of

21

1

statute enacted by Congress proscribes the interstate mailing

2

transportation,, transportation through the mail, of obscene

3

material^

4

In addition, there is a treaty that the United States

5

is a party to that the Court referred to in the Roth case and

6

Hr. Justice Brennan's opinion that requires the United States

7

to take necessary steps to prohibit the international traffic

8

of obscene materials.

9

Moreover, we have a number of pending cases that we

10

refer to in our amicus brief in which the issue of the meaning

11

and effect of Stanley is centrally raised.

12

ing their way up to this Court, but because this case is being

13

considered this term

14

appropriate to express our views on the question of the meaning

15

of Stanley at this point and not to run the risk of having an

IS

opportunity to do so.

17

Q

Those cases are work

and those cases will not we thought it

Did I understand from scanning your brief that

18

at least one Federal court, I think in California, has held this

19

Federal legislation or part of it constitutionally invalid based

20

on Stanley?

21

A

Yes, that is correct. Your Honor.

22

Q

And that was the importation statute, the cus­

23
24
2S

toms statute?
A

That is correct, based

on the same

reading in the opinion in Stanley as the district

22

1

Q

That Judge Alberts gave?

2

A

Yes, that is correct.

3

Q

Is the Solicitor General able to give us any

4

more definite definition of this crime than that it must be

5

something that does net have a redeeming social value?

6

what is it then?

7

A

Is so,

As Your Honor knows, the issue of obscenity is

8

one that has divided the Court perhaps more than any other issue

9

in recent times.

10

11

We are, of course, aware of your position and

the position of Mr. Justice Douglas on the matter.
Q

I am not just talking about the position'or

12

individual, I am talking about a situation where there has been

13

an evident, honest, deliberate purpose to find some way, make a

14

definition that does not leave people uncertain.

15

Solicitor General have any idea of a better way than the test

16

to be whether it has redeeming social values?

17

A

Does the

That is one aspect of several that the Court has
I think the answer to your

10

applied in determining obscenity.

19

question is no and I think it would really be an insult to the

20

intelligence of those justices and judges and counsel that have

21

struggled over the last 15 and 20 years to comment a definition -

22

Q

23

A

That is quite a struggle.
You are quite right — to suggest that we —

As

24

Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out that in cases taken and considered

25

on tiie merits this Court -- his count then was 55 separate
-

22

-

1

opinions, it is over 60 now.

2

I would suggest that one way of looking at it as Attorney General

3

Quinn did is that it is a problem that the legislative branch,

4

both at the State and the Federal level, has some role to play

5

in.

8

has enacted — they have sought to reflect as best they can this

It is a very difficult problem, but

The statutes that the States have enacted and the Congress

Court’s articulation of the pertinent constitutional standards.
There is, as the Chief Justice indicated, a penumbra
where an individual has to make a very difficult choica.

10

Q

n

A

Choice.

\z

Q

Well, doasn5t he have to make a guess?

A

I think that is correct, Your Honor.

Y3

U
15
16

think that is limited to the areci of obscenity.

X don’t

I think that

perhaps there is a heightened impact there because of the First
Amendment and its protection of free expression.

But I don't

think that we should throw the whole notion of obscenity legis­
17
18
19
20
21

22

lation out simply because it is difficult to arrive at a satis­
factory definition.
I think the Court has worked through the cases that
have come to it to reach such a definition.

We think that the

definition stated in Roth, as explicated in subsequent cases, .
memoirs in Redrup, is a workable definition that permits on the

23
one hand free expression of those ideas that the framers- of the-»
24
First Amendment had in mind protecting and yet allows States and
25

23

I

the Federal Government to prevent on behalf of the people materi il

that has no role to play.

Q

How do we know exactly what ideas the framers had

A

Your Honor, the Court traced this in the Roth

in mind?

case, traced the history of the First Amendment.

7

clear at the time that the First Amendment was adopted and rafcif:

8

that there were obscenity laws on the books at that time.

9

Q

Undoubtedly.

It was quite

Undoubtedly, but I thought the ob­

10

ject of the Constitution was to say what the Government could do

11

and what it could not do.

12

13
14
15
16

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

I think that this

Court has —-Q

They just didn't

ratify what had been done be­

fore , did it?
A

No, but I think the Constitution has to be read

17

in -the historical context in which those words were written.

18

is what the Court in Roth said, and that is the point of departure

19

that the Court has followed since that time.

20

Q

Th<jt

There weren't any Federal obscenity laws on the

21

book at the time the Constitution was written because there was

22

no Federal Government until the Constitituion was ratified.

23

A

That is correct, there ~—

24

Q

And the First Amendment is directed only at goverr

25

ing what the Federal Government can do, at least that was true

24

24
25

which there is an area of uncertainty and the language simply
doesn’t lend'itself to any better definition.

The Court has

1

and attempted and worked and I assume will continue to work with

2

the refinement of the standard as best it can in this area and

3

in the area you refer to and in other areas.

4

Q

Seventy-six years ago this Court decided almost

4-1/2 to 4-1/2 on the Northern Securities case,,or I think it

I suppose in

10

A

Yes, Your Honor, I think that is correct.

11

Q

Do I understand you to agree with the statement

12

that was made that many businessmen think you have no boundaries

13

Or, are you saying that you do not think that there any more

14

solid boundaries for the anti-trust laws than for obscenity?

15

Which are you saying?

16

A

Yousaid you agreed to something.

I think that the Chief Justice was suggesting tha

17

in the anti-trust field under the broad dictates of the Sherman

18

Act and Clayton Act, this Court’s opinions construing those

19

statutes that there was at least as much ambiguity about those

20

opinions in the standards there annunciated as in the obscentiy

21

field.

22

Q

Do you think that is the case?

23

A

Yes, I think ------

24

o

Do you think so?

25

Q

I think perhaps you have overstated inadvertently

-

26

8

my position.

I think there is a difference, but it is one of

Z

only degree.

I think the publishers and exhibitors maybe have

3

a little harder time of it.

4

the businessmen think they have the harder time of it.

5

A

I am sure they thing so.

I would like to turn to Stanley.

Perhaps

Ifcha's beers

6

discussed a bit, but that is the central concern for us and 1

7

should like to give the Court the Government’s view of what

8

Stanley holds and what it doesn’t hold.
As we read that opinion, it expressly disclaimed under­

9
10

mining of Roth and its progeny.

11

cern there was with the mere possession of materials that might

12

be regarded as obscene in the privacy of an individual’s home.

13

We suggest that it is inappropriate for the District Court to

14

extrapolate from that narrow holding a decision with what we

15

regard as sweeping implications in the whole field of obscenity

16

as it has.

17

It said instead that the con­

What the District Court essentially did, as the Court

18

is aware here, is hold dividing two to one that because there

19

was a right to possess privately materials that might in other

20

context be regarded as obscene, it was necessarily all right to

21

receive them.

22

was necessarily a right to distribute them and therefore is

23

a right for commercial distribution that adheres to any exhibito:

24

of a film or distributor of a book or whatever.

Since there was the right to receive them, there

You are saying it matters very much where he

How do you suggest that he would have gaiijs

He could have obtained it in a variety of ways.

Q

He would almost have had to written it. himself,

wouldn't he, under your theory?
A

No, Your Honor.

I assume he obtained it from

the same sort of source that other Stanley's obtain similar sort

of materials,.
Q

Yes, but you are felling us it is illegal or can

3

be made illegal and has been made illegal by the States and the

4

Federal Government for one Mr. Stanley to sell or give the bock

3

to another Mr. Stanley.

6

create his own.

7

A

So, each Mr. Stanley apparently has to

He doesn’t have to.

We know as a practical matter

8

that Stanley's can obtain this material.

The question is whether

9

the holding in Stanley reaches as far as giving constitutional

10

sanction to the people that would distribute it.

?!

it doesn't.

12

13
14
15

Q

I am suggesting it would be kind of an empty righ:.

and that the Court in Stanley may have been spending a lot of
time writing a very eloquent opinion about almost nothing at
all if the right of possession of something doesn't involve or

bring in its train the right to acquire it.

A

The basic right it seems to me, Mr. Justice

2
Stewart, is really a right not to be interfered with by the
3
Government in this possession and the right has, we think, Fourth,
4
and Fifth Amendment underpinnings that ——
5
Q

The opinion of the Court in Stanley, as I under­

6
stood it •— I did not join it as you know —■ is based on the

7
First Amendment.

The separate opinion in that case which I do

8
know something about having written it was based on the Fourth
9
Amendment.

Quite a different basis.

10
A

But I would suggest that there is a long quote

11
in there from Olmstead which was a Fourth Amendment case and
12
there is repeated references to invasions of privacy and that is
13
Fourth Amendment talk as far as I read this Court’s opinion.

14
It seems to us that what the Court should do in this
15
area is to adhere to the standards that it has enunciated in

16
the past instead of the bold departure that the District Couru

17
here has suggested.
18
The District Court suggested that so long as material
19
commercially disseminated was adequately controlled,by adequately

20
controlled the District Court suggested not allowing minors in,
21
no pandering and insuring that there was no intrusion into un­

22
willing or uninterested people.
.23
The District Court suggested so long as that was done
24
that then commercial distribution of films, books, whatever would
25
be constitutionally protected.

■that prevents legislatures from reflecting the will of the people„
I would suggest that the Court shouldn’t do that.

hasn't done that up to now and we suggest that it is not appro­

on the question of the meaning of Stanley, we suggest that ifc

It refused

and which prompted the entry of the order which is here under
review,' the interlocutory order which appears on pages 4 4 to
45 of the appendix, the circumstances which prompted the entry
of that order were solely and exclusively the fact that in the
interim that State prosecution had gone through a trial and a
judge had found, the appellees in this case guilty.

The State

prosecutor then returned to the Federal court and said that
whereas heretofore I have by stipulation permitted this film to
continue its exhibition during the pendency of that trial I
hereby withdraw that stipulation.

"Was it to permit astate prosecutor

i

Now, I point out to the Court —

What you are saying is this is not a 2283 case at

We think it is — this follows a fortiori

Q

That is the question in debate.

11

A

Right.

12

Q

But it is a Dumbrowski issue and not a 2283 issue.

13

A

Definitely a 2283 issue, but we think it is not

14

even Dumbrowski for this reason, Mr. Justice ——

15

Q

That is another question.

16

A

It is not a Dumbrowski issue because in this case

17

the relief actually granted by the District Court did not in

19

order is read, and we think that this Court must judge the case

If the order is read, it removed not a single

Court, it was faced with the question of whether it should at
the point where the State prosecutor had said, "I will now seise
this film, I will now indict again and again, if this film is
shown."

The three-judge court was faced with the question whethi

having previously allowed the State court proceedings to continue
whether it should then, having indeed abstained — we submit tha
under the traditional view of what abstention is that is exactly
what the District Court judge did in this case.
He said, "I will retain jurisdiction over this case.
I -will permit you to make your ccnsitutional claims in the State
courts, and you can come back to me ultimately after you have
gone through that State procedure."
But then there was a change of facts.

Suddenly there

IS
was a conviction and the prosecutor said, "Now the film has got
20

to stop, and I will indict and seise."

At that point, the

21

three-judge district Court said, "We have to consider what the
22
probable outcome of the State case will be, because that is
23

relevant to a detejrmination as to whether this exhibitor is
24

entitled to interim relief."
25

39

It was for that reason, and that reason alone, that
the three"judge District Court then went on to consider in terms
of probable outcome the constitutional issue which was presented
by the challenge to the statute on its face»
Q

Didn't you attempt a temporary injunction agains;

further prosecution?
A

He issued, Mr. Justice Harlan, a temporary in­

junction against proceeding civiallv or criminally or otherw

e

interfering with the exhibition.
I think an important element in understanding that
11

injunction is the sentence which the next to last sentence of

12

the Dictrict Judge's opinion»

13

opinion as to the legal consequences if plaintiffs exhibit their

14

film under the protection of our injunction, and it is ultimatel Y

16

was properly considered illicit»

17

lie says, "Finally, we voice no

What Judge Aldrich was saying in that sentence, 1

18

submit, was that if these appellees, who were now entitled to

19

be free of the threat, the jawboning as it were of a local D.A.,

20

now go out and continue to show the film "I am Curious Yellow"

21

they are assuming the risk they were assuming all along»

22

if at some future date the film was found obscene and the

23

statute is found constitutional, they may b® prosecuted even

24

for the period of exhibition between the date of the injunction

25

and the date of that finding.

Ti

t,

All that the order did, Mr. .Justice Harlan, was tell
the D.A. you may not threaten these prosecutors with indictu nfc,
you may not seize this film, you may not interferewith its show­
ing., but nothing beyond that.
Q

Well,

that is what, the issue is here whether he

should have done that.
A

Right,

But, it holds up the State process in the

SI

interim but does not forever foreclose a prosecution even for

12

that interim period.

13

Q

Oh, certainly.

14

A

In other words, ultimately they may prosecute.

15

The question now is, and we submit that — well, let me first

16

turn then in that context to the abstention point.

17

with respect to this interim relief which the three-judge dis­

18

trict court granted is was that appropriate action by a Federal

IS

District Court?

20

was it appropriate in terms of the injunctive relief which is —

1

22
3

The question

Is that aoDronriate in terms of abstention,

or the ground rules for injunctive relief set out in this
Court's opinion in Dumbrowski?

We submit it plainly was.

Unlike all of the other cases which this Court hasd

4

heard in the last two case, this is an instance on ongoing, con­

5

tinuing to this very day suppression of speech.

Nothing is more

plainly demonstrable than the fact that from the time that the

3

shown by these appelless in Boston»

4

because that stipulation was withdrawn.

It is not shown today only

5

If we are talking as ---

6

Q

Why is it not being shown?

7

A

Because the District Attorney announced to the

8

Federal District Court on November 12, 1969, that if that film

9

was reopened he would seize and he would prosecute, although

10

he had then one prosecution.

11

Q

So, why didn't you show it?

12

A

Because it would just subject my clients to

13

continuing harassment of seizures and prosecutions.

14

to open the film, it would immediately be seized by police offi­

15

cers, there would be an indictment

Q

The substance of your position, then, is that

17

Federal intervention is justified by a desire to avoid a State

18

criminal prosecution?

19

A

Federal intervention is justified, Mr. Justice

20

White, when the State prosecution, the threat of State prosecu­

21

tion, is being used to close down a film, whose obscenity is

22

then being litigated in the State courts.

23

Q

When the threat of criminal prosecution is effec­

24

tive enough to deter someone from exercising what he claims is

25

his right of free speech and which he would otherwise exercise.

That is exactly what, we say.

We say that a

2

a host of reasons supporting this injunction.

as probably unconstitutional under Stanley.

If the prosecutor is by ---- we don't deny the

prosecutor’s right to indict and to prosecute after he has a
finding that a film is obscene and that has been concluded.
We are assuming that risk.

The risk we don't have to assume,

Mr. Justice White, and I think that is the risk that tills
Court talked about in Dumbrowski, is what I think is very
practically a risk of a very much different magnitude and that
is day in and day out seizures of films, repeated indictments
for every day in which you show a film.

We are assuming the

risks.
Q

What is the prosecutor supposed to do, say I

you can go ahead, but I am constitutionally obligated to let

your position?

Then, you are squarely up to the question whethsjsr

2

we are obliged to institute a spearate proceeding in a State

3

court where we chose instead to go to a Federal Court.
In this Cour'fc case in England vs. Louisiana State

4

S

Broad of Medical Examiners, that was specifically rejected by

6

the Court.

7

to present to a Federal District Court our claim that the pro­

8

secutor is not permitteed, either because the statute is uncon­

9

stitutional or because he is in effect-- what this prosecutor

10

has in effect done is he has implemented a system of informal

?J

censorship.

12

If we have a claim under 1983, if we are entitled

16

19

20
21

22
23

24
25

Indeed, as you pointed out, Mr. Justice

If he can go over to any exhibitor of motion films in Massachu­
setts and say I will indict you tomorrow if you show that film,
aiid, of course, the exhibitor will close up.

If he says, I will

indict you time and again and again and again if you show it,
then a fortiori he will close up.
Now, our client has taken the risk.

He is, in fact,

presently under an appeal sentence of one year imprisonment for
showing this film.

He is, in fact, assuming a further risk under

Judge Aldrich's opinion -that if, in fact, this film is found
obscene he can be prosecuted after the judgment of conviction
is ultimately confirmed and.after this Court acts on that film

46

1
2

he can be p 3:0 s ecu ted for every dciy that he now shows that film.
The only relief we are seeking is interim relief.,

3
4

Q

So, pending a State criminal prosecution, pend­

ing the outcome of the State criminal prosecution, the Federal,

5

court is authorized to require that the conduct as challenged

6

by the State be permitted to continue?

7
8

A

No, Mr. Justice White, our position is that when

is it speech

9

Q

There is where there is a film involved.

10

A

When it is continuing speech, yes, that is our

11

positions, because otherwise, if you don't do that, if you don't

12

do that, then, in fact, what you are saying to the District

13

Attorney is you may without State statute, this Court has said

14

time and again that in the First Amendment area if the State

15

legislates, it must narrowly define the conduct to be prohibited,

16

Q

I suppose then Freedman against Maryland really

17

ought to be amended in your position to say that no State Board

18

of Censors can stop a film pending appeal of the censorship

19

decision.

20

A

No, because

21

Q

Why not?

22

A

23
24
25

Because Freedman and Maryland provides the very

procedural safeguards which we say are absent, here.

6

what it does, what has happened in Freedman and Maryland, Mr,
Justice White, is that the State of Maryland has focused on the
question of exhibition of films.

9
10

II

It has said that with regard

to the exhibition of films, we authorize this procedure.

The

State of Massachusetts has never done that.
Q

7
3

True, it doesn’t regulate the length of time, but

Yes, but nevertheless in the Freedman case the

State of Maryland is saying you can’t show the film and you are
not going to show the film unless you can get this order upset
on appeal.

It may take a long time*, and Freedman doesn't even

limit the time to the court of appeals of Maryland.
A

12

It may, indeed, but the difference, we thiink,

between that case and this is that there Maryland has specifica!'
13

focused on the question of films and has made a determination
14

as to what are the appropriate procedures in the interim.

That i:

15

just not true in Massachusetts.
13

Massachusetts could very easily enact an injunction
17

statute as was approved by this Court, for example, in Kingsley
18

Books.
13

Q

You haven't given them a chance to focus on it.

20
You haven’t even asked them about the interim stay.

You haven’t

21

asked the State court or anybody else in the State about an

22
interim stay.

24

was simply to institute a separate proceeding.

If we have a

That is one of

Your Honor, I think, with all deference, I

7

think the issue hare — I mean that issue was taken care of by

&

the England case.

9

England vs. Louisiana State Board, and I refer to page 415,

Very specifically what the Court said in

10

"When a Federal court is properly appealed to in case over which

11

it has by law jurisdiction, it is its duty to take such juris­

12

diction." The right of a party-plaintiff to chose a Federal

13

court when there is a choice cannot be properly denied.

14

The additional difference, Mr. Justice White, is that

15

there is here no question of State law, which we want to go fcc

16

a State court on.

17

of bringing a separate suit in a State court is to bring a

18

separate suit for the purpose of havincr the state court make

19

the very consitutional determination that we are asking the Fed©

20

court to do.

21
22
23
24

25

What you are urging us to do in the terms

That this Court specifically said in McNaese was

impermissible, was the wrong standard to apply.

You can’t force

a plaintiff to claim his Federal constitutional right in the
State court when it is the same right that he is claiming in the
Federal court.

grounds*, which are that in the absence of any State injunction
statutes- in the absence of any State statute such as that in
Freedman and Maryland, in the absence of any State provision
that says to a State District Attorney, you may call determina­
tion of a film, this District Attorney could not in effect stop
this film from being shown by withdrawing that stipulation.
That is really all that the order that was issued by Judge A1drich did.
It simply said to the State District Attorney,

14
15

may not interfere with the exhibition of tills film. *'

in?

We think the same would be true if a plaintiff

could show that that repeated indictment and seizure was like the,
allegations in Dumbrowski pursuant to a plan to suppress the

Dombrowski.

Q

Then you are arguing that even apart from that

U
15

16

the reach of Dombrowski ought to enable the Federal courts to
stop in where there are at least more than one prosecution you got,
A

Yes, we think —

but as I have tried to point

17

out, we think it is even beyond Dombrowski because in Dombrowski

18

the District Court was being asked to take an issue away from

19

the State courts, to take away from the State court the issue

20

of the constitutionality of that Louisiana subversive act.

21

Q

Mr. Lewin, there is another little difference.

22

In the Dombrowski case, as I read it, they would put that man

out of business and his whole organization.

Is there anything in this case that says that the

That is plain, Your Honor, from the withdrawal of

the stipulation and the fact that immediately upon its withdrawal
the film is terminated.

Well, I could construe that as saying we don't

23
I would like to direct myself to that question for a

If it has that power, why hasn’t it done so in
I can’t see that part of your argument.

8

A

Why hasn't the State of Massachusetts done it?

9

Q

Why is it not specific?

10
11

I thought it was? as

specific as it could be made.
A

Mr. Justice Black, this statute is not as specific

12

as it could be made.

1.3

Q

How could it be made any more specific?

14

A

The Massachusetts’ statute with respect to books,

15

-or example, provides an interim proceeding, provides a number,

16

s. great number of procedural, constitutional safeguards to pro-

17

beet the rights of publishers and book sellers.

18
19

20

Q

That procedural safeguard, that doesn't have any-

:.hing to do with the fact that I understand you to say now. you are
Jefending this on the ground that although the court can abridge

21

speech that the court deems immoral or obscene that here it hasn*

22

lone so with sufficient definiteness.

23
24

I think it has, in the

state of Massachusetts.

For example, criminal prosecutions are not brought

It just means he is going to take in to the

grand jury or issue an information charge,, doesn’t it?
A

I simply — I don’t want to suggest that if

assa--

chusAtts enacted a new statute applicable to films which pro­
vided precisely what the Massachusetts statute applicable to

5
books provided that, that would solve all of the problem,» but I
6
am suggesting that the State can in Massachusetts, obviously
7
can, look the problem of freedom of speech in films and look at
8
the problem of obscenity and corae: a lot closer to protecting the
9
rights of persons who have as their duty the exercise of Firs :
10
Amendment rights in trying to pursue their legitimate State
11
interest in obscenity, their interest, their purpose in protect­
12

ing the people of the State from obscenity,
13
I suggest that what this Court said in Stanley, what
14
this Court said in Redrup are the legitimate State purposes,

'1

15
think that if this statute were restricted to the dangers pointed
16
out in the Stanley vs, Georgia decision and in Redrup, that is
17
the dangers of pandering, solicitation, the dangers that materia],
18

might fall into the hands of children emd the danger of obtrusive
19

invasions of privacy, that we would have a statute that people

20
could operate ’under without wholesale violations of their con­
21
stitutional rights.

Attorney General Quinn, you

MR. QUINN:

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
We all agree that we have difficulty with thedefinition

I must confess now I have a great deal of diffi­

io

Q

The word what?

ii

A

"Threat," Your Honor.

12

After five and one half months of the showing of the

13

film by the appellees here, "I Am Curious Yellow," after a trial

14

on the merits in Superior Court lasting days, not suddenly, in

15

a colloquy in the Federal cctirfc, the District Attorney declines

16

to renew a stipulation which he mace previously that he would

17

not seek further prosecutions that seek to enjoin the showing of

18

this film until the conclusion of the trial on the merits, this

19

is all called threats.

20

all called multiple prosecution.

the case.

It is compeltely not

The record dhows no evidence of threats whatsoever

but simply a declination

to renew a stipulation by the District

Attorney.
S
Q

Well, ha was just calling it legally threatened.

He wasn't criticising your official

functions.

7
A

I submit that however we. interpret or define

8
threats, that cannot be held to be a threat legally in the Fngli :kh
9
language or even in the Swedish language.
10

Further, wa must accept the fact that my brother has
11

conceded that there has never been an effort made in the State
12
courts of Massachusetts to continue the showing of this film.
13

I submit in conclusion that the appellees here are not
14

Grove Press Inc.

The appellees here are film distributors.

The

15
action on the part of the appellants has never under any color
16
or interpretation of that action been able to be defined as
17

threats or anywhere near the fact

ation existing in the

18
Dombrowski vs. Pfister.
19

Q

Mr. Quinn, I am, perhaps it has been made clear,

20
but if so I missed .it, what is the posture of the State prosecu­
21
tion now in the Massachusetts courts?

There has been

a convic­

22

And the Bill of Exceptions was entered yesterday

in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court which leaves us to

October sitting.
How long ddes it usually take for the Massac

setts Supreme Court to get down decisions?
A
never having

Our Massachusetts Supreme Court has a tradition o f
letting a year pass without deciding all of the

cases that were argued before it;, and I think that it is safe
to assume that within a month or two after the oral argument the: ba
would be a decision on this case, Your Honor.

Sof it begins this calendar year?
That is correct, Your Honor.

MR. QUINN:

I thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
