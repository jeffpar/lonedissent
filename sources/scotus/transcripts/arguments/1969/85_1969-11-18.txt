In the present case this Court is called upon to

question of standing to suit.

The other Petitioner is Data Systems, Incorporated,

a Minnesota Corporation, a member of the association which is

referred to as ADAPSG and Data Systems is engaged in rendering

data processing services in Minnesota.

9

Respondents are the American National Bank and Trust

10

Company of St. Paul, a national bank and the Comptroller of th ■

11

Currency.
The facts allege that Data Systems was engaged in

12

the data processing business in Minnesota and that the Americeh

14

National Bank was similarly!engaged in the data processing

15

business, and as a matter of fact. Data Systems had agreed to

There is no question about that.

banks under the national banking laws.

The complaint also asked for declaratory relief

t

that the Comptroller of the Currency was acting unlawfully

2

when he authorized national banks to engage in the general

data processing business„
The Comptroller's authorisation is found, on Page 2

4
5

of Petitioner’s brief and it's in a paragraph of the Comp­

6

troller's manual for national banks.

It states as follows:

"Incidental to its banking services a national bank

7

8

xnav make available its data processing equipment or perform

9

data processing services on such equipment for the banks and

10

bank customers."

11

banks assumed authority to do this type of activity.

If they had authority under the Acts of

It’s the last three words that gives the

Q

Then the question is the statute;

isn’t it?

A

That's correct; the question is statutory

authority.
In our brief we have raised the general question of

19

20

standing to sue and we have discussed the so-called "legal

2!

right theory" the requirement that a plaintiff must have a

22

legal right to have standing to maintain an action ofthis

23
24

25

nature.

This rule was probably most prominently denounced in

the case of Tennessee Electric Power versus TVh in 36 D. S.
Reports.

But this was not the issue that divided the Courts

4

?

2
3

of Appeals for the First and the Eighth Circuits and I would
talk to that narrower issue which did divide the circuits.
And, that*'s the question of statutory aid to standing»

The rule generally may be stated that if a. competi­
tor can show that a statute was intended to' protect these
competitive or economic interests, then he has standing to

The relevant portion is quoted in our brief at

This is a 1962 statute.
It is therefore extremely important to examine the

13

legislative purpose of the Bank Service Corporation Act to

14

decide ex culpa the protection afforded the data processing

13

industry.

16

The basic purpose of the Act is undoubted.

It was

17

to allow smaller banks to achieve more effective competition

18

against larger banks by joining together to invest in Bank

Such things

Prior to 1962 it was felt that banks could not invest
in corporations of this type, so the basic purpose was to

5

1

authorize national banks to join together in this function.
How, the question promptly came upas to the extent

2
3

that bank service corporations could engage in the general

4

data processing business and the compromise or result reached

3

by the House of Representatives which had the bill initially,

6

was topermit Bank Service Corporation subsidiaries to perform

7

these services for nonbank customers to the extent of

8

half of their total activities.

9

their total activities could be performed for nonbank cus­

10
n

one-

Not to exceed one-half of

tomers .
When the bill got to the Senate certain Senators

12

were not satisfied with even this restriction and a Minority

13

Report was issued by the Senate Banking and Currency Committee

14

Senators Proxmire, Neubergar and Douglas issued a report

IS

criticising the one-half limitation as being excessive,.

16
17

That’s found in our brief on Page 33, excerpts from
that report.

Is11 read the Court .one sentence, and this is

is

the basic point of the Minority Report. They stated that

19

"adequate justification has not been demonstrated for extend­

20

ing this exemption to permit banks to engage in the business

21

of data processing which this bill permits up to 50 percent

22
23

25

;

of the total activity of a bank service corporation.
Senator Proxraire went further.

amendment on the Floor of the Senate to prohibit bank service
corporations totally from engaging in data processing services

so that the Coufct can see exactly what the Senator was driving

at with his amendment.
He stated that"banks have customer lists and they

can offer their customers, for instance, the service of hand­

n

ling their receivables, which would give the banks' a substan­

12

tial advantage over other legitimate, long-established business

13

14

have informed me and other Senators that this kind of compe­

15

tition would be very unfair.

We believe that this case requires in

5

unique

6

fashion an interpretation of the scope of the so-called

7

“statutory aid to standing doctrine."

8

Courts have been faced with the question of whether a statute

9

was designed to protect the competitive interest.

In previous cases the

competitive interest, then the Courts held that the protected

On the other hand, if the statute or constitutional

15

provision was not so designed and was not intended to offer

16

protection to competitive interests then the competitors were

17

held not to have standing.

18

However, in this case we have a situation that is

19

not occurred before, to the bast of our research and Respon­

20

dents have cited no cases.showing a situation where there is

21

a undoubted Congressional purpose to protect a competitive

22

interest, but from a source of competition which is slightly

23

different, although closely related to the actual source of

24

competition.

We feel that they are pushingthe doctrine of standing beyond

The rules of standing have the effect of preventing

13

an inquiry into the merits of litigation and we feel that

15

rules that have this effect of preventing reaching the merits

16

should be rather narrowly and restrictively interpreted.

Q

Would you say it isn't enough for standing just

to show an economic injury?
A

12

13

Oh, .1 think it is if you overrule about three

or four cases in this court.

Q

Are you, suggesting that we do that?

Yes, Your Honor; and in our brief we said that

We feal that the Bank Service Corporation Act is a

And we think that reading the

The Bank Service Corporation Act is relevant because
it bears on this problem.

It was an undoubted congressional

response or effort to protect data processors.

For this

reason we feel it is relevant.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ALAN S. ROSENTHAL, ESQ.

17

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. ROSENTHAL:

18

Mr. Rosenthal.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

19

the Courts

Over a period of almost 90 years, beginning with

20

its decision of 1882 when Railroad Company against ElXsxman,

21

this Court hafs consistently adhered to the rule that where, as

22

is eoncededly the case here, there is no special statutory

23

provision or judicial review that complaintants seeking to

24

attack governmental action which doss not more than increase

25

competition against it, show
14

hat he possesses a legally

1

2

protective right to be free from that, competition.
Now, the Court has further made it clear that .if, as

3

is also true in this case, no such legally-protected right

4

was conferred by license or franchise, a plaintiff must be

5

able to demonstrate that, as this Court put it just two terms

6

ago in Hardin against Kentucky Utilities? the particular

7

statutory provision invoked reflects a legislative purpose to

8

protect a competitive interest.

9

If, but only if, such a purpose appears, and we

10

again quote from Hardin -- "Injured competitor has standing to

11

require compliance with that provision."

IZ

Now, notwithstanding the present reiianiae of

13

Petitioner upon the Bank Service Corporation Act, to which

U

X will turn in a few minutes, the fact remains that its

15

complaint invoked only the Incidental Powers Clause of the

16

national Bank Act.

17

authorizes national banks to exercise, and I quotes "Such

18

incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the

19

business of banking."

20

The prevision of 12 USC 24 (7th} which

Specifically, as Petitioners complaint reflects,

2!

their attack upon the Comptroller's ruling that national banks

22

may provide data processing services to other banks and bank

23

customers was -based exclusively on the proposition that such

24

services do not. come within the purview of the Incidental

25

Powers' Clause.

Q

Is that pleading argument the fatal argument?

I mean, is that a fatal thing from their point of view?
A

Well, it is, fatal, Mr. Justice Harlan, from

their point of view for the reasons that they cannot as they

S

do now, assert that the conduct which they are seeking to

6

enjoin violates any statute but the National Bank Act.

22

to base their claim of standing upon a statute which they

cannot claim has been violated.

instances,, at least, that "the procedure which was being

who would qualify as persons aogrieved.
Nov;, Congress has not chosen to clothe these

16

18

Petitioners with the status of essentially private fraternitie
generally.

20

for anyone to attack, excepting government agents.
A

21

22
23

Your Honor,there are areas —

many areas in

which the superintendents of compliance with statutory man­
dates rests with the Congress itself.
Q

24

25

Your position makes it very hard, doesn't it,

asked yous

Well, then, what do you say to the question 1
Doesn't it make it almost impossible for anybody
18

!

to challenge it excepi: the bank officers or Superinbea&ent

2

of Banks himself?

3

A

2 would think, Your Honor, with respect to this,

4

particular provision there are few individuals that have

5

standing to attack this provisioni that's correct, in court.

6

Q

Would the stockholders — the bank stockholders

7

A

The stockholders —- well, not — certainly —

8

Q

On the basis of ultra —

9

A

Yes, 2 would think that it is quite possible

10

the stockholders would, but in the realm of competitors and

1!

the realm of individuals such as these petitioners who are

12

complaining of competitive activity on the part of the banks,

13

their remedy lies with the Congress to which they have gone,

14

repeatedlys both be ora and after the passage of the Bank

15

Service Corporation Act. ■

16

17
18

Q

Then are you telling us that’s the way the

Congress wants it?
A

Precisely, Mr. Justice of the Court; that the

19

name ADAPSO itself, has been before the Congress; it has

20

fought after the Bank Service Corporation act was passed to

21

have Congress specifically preclude data processing service

22

activities on the part of banks except as they related to

23

internal operations of the bank.

24

25

They have also called to the Congress5 s attention
the absence, of a judicial review provision and the necessity

19

1

for such a provision and to this point those pleas have fallen

2

on deaf ears„

3

Now, we say if is quite appropriate for the Congress

4

to decide whereas here there is no legally-protected right of

5

the Petitioner's being invaded.

S

decide the extent to which it wishes to deputize these

7

Petitioners or any other class

3

to enforce what they say is the public interest in compliance

9

with the National Bank Act.
Q

10

It is open to the Congress to

as private attorneys general

May I ask you a questions

Again, assuming that

11

they are right and that Congress has made it unlawful for

12

these banks to do exactly what they are charged with doing

13

and did it in order to protect competitors, it is your

14

position that nobody can challenge it except the bank exam­

15

iners?

16
17

h

No, Your Honor.

If Congress had done this for

the protection of competitors, then under the established
\

18

standing doctrine, the latest decision being Your Honor's

19

decision in —- in Hardin.

20

Q

That's their argument? isn't it?

21

A

But we insist, if the Court pleases, that the

22

restrictions which they seek to enforce, a restriction of the

23

National Bank Act was not intended to protect a competitive

24

interest, and indeed, they don't argue to the contrary.

25

They

have never suggested, either in the lower courts or in this
20

3

Court that the purpose of the —

a

Q

I misunderstood their argument here.

3

A

Ho.

Their contention is that in the Bank

4

Service Corporation Act, specifically with relation, to

5

Section 4 of that Act, that Congress manifested an intent to

6

protect data processors from the- kind of competition of which

7

they complain.
Q

8

9

How, assume that that9s trues let's assume it

was passed for that purpose.

Is it still your •— it may be

10

sound, I*m not saying it's not — 1 want to get just how far

n

it goes.

12

pressed desire of Congress to give these kind of competitors

13

a protection, that none of them can raise it?

It's still your argument, notwithstanding the ex­

14

A

No, that’s not my argument. Your Honor.

15

If the. Bank Service Corporation Act audits legisla­

16

tive history manifested a Congressional intent to protect data

17

processing service companies from competitionon the part of

18

national banks then I would certainly agree that under the

19

teachings of this Court, just recently again in the Hardin

20

case, standing would exist.

21

What wa say is that there isn't a jot or syllable

22

in the legislative history of the Bank Service Corporation Act

23

to indicate any Congressional intent to protect the Bank Ser­

24

vice Corporation from the competition of which they are com­

25

plaining here.
21

?

Now, the

2

G

Well, let me ask you the question my brother

3

Harlan asked you'-a little bit ago:

4

aren't you saying that we have to look at this Act in order to

5

see whether that was its purpose to decide standing?

S

A

If that's the case,

The only extent that you have to look to the

7

Bank Service Corporation Act — again, in response to Mr.

8

Justice Harlan, I suggested that vie did not need to reach the

9

merits of this controversy, because the merits, of course, are

10

in terms of an alleged violation of the National Bank Act and

11

it's not necessary to reach that question, whether or not the

12

National Bank Act was violated in order to decide standing.

13

Now, with respect to the BankService Corporation

14

Act idle: only thing that is required is to examine its legis­

IS

lative history and determine whether the Congress was intending

is

by that act to any extent to protect a competitive interest of

i?

data processing service companies against national bank com­

18

petition .

19

20

Q

Well, supposing this suit arose under the

Sank Servicing Act, would you question standing?

22

If this was an attack upon a Bank Service
standing
Corporation activity, I think then the/question would foe much

23

closer.

Zi

A

I say that —

24

Q

Wouldn’t it foe clsarly against you?

25

A

1 don't think so. Your Honor, for this reason:
22

1

Q

Why not?

z

A

Because the only statement inthe entire

3

legislative history of the Bank Service Corporation Act that

4

manifested any concern for the protection of data processors

5

was the statement on the Floor by Senator Proxmira.

6

Court has cautioned before --

Now# this

7

Q

Well# what about the provision itself?

8

A

The provision itself could have been for many

9

different reasons.

In the Congressional mind the provision

10

itself might have been# again, because of a feeling that the

St

ban]; service corporations in the general public interest

12

without relation to any specific competitive group# should, not

13

be engaging in activities other than, theproviding of bank

14

services to banks.

15

the myriad approaches there may have been.

There is no way of really telling what of

But this much is clear;

16

We're dealing with national

17

banks here.

Congress in connection with the Bank Service

18

Corporation Act# both Banking and Currency Committees: the

19

Committo 3 in the House and .the Committee in the SEnate, were

20

specifically apprised of the fact that national banks were

21

engaging in this activity.

22

Mow# if there were —-

Would it bother you to tell a man who doesn’t

24

know all about bank services# exactly what bank services •—

25

precisely what bank services are involved?

Then we can see who

the competitors are.
A

Well, there is no bank service corporation

involved in the present case, Your Honor.
Q

That's right, it's the banks.

But what are the

bank services that are being performed that they object to?
A

The bank services —■• well, what they seek to

11

enjoin as being outside the scope of 24(7th) is the providing

12

of data processing services to the customers of the bank.

13

Q

What are they data processing?

14

A

You mean what kind of services?

15

Q

Yes.

10

A

Well, it. would include, for example, putting a

17

company * s payroll through a computer.

and bookkeeping type of services which today are provided in

19

most up-to-date business establishments on an automatic basis,

It's the kind of record

20

Q

That’s precisely what’s involved?

21

A

That is correct.

But getting back, if I may,

22

just for a minute, to the legislative history of the Bank

2c

Service Corporation Act, isn’t it reasonable to assume that

91

had there been this concern that Petitioners insist existed,

21

of regarding competition on the part of banka themselves,
na

«£» -:i

and national banks in particular with data processing service

companies.

3

Section 4 would not have been cast as it is solely
in terMs of the Bank Service Corporation, but would have em­

5

braced the banks as well.

0

the Act does deal with banks in a completely, of course, un­

7

related content.

8
9

And in point of fact, Section 5 of

Now, we think it is very difficult for Petitioners
to seriously argue here that even though the statute which

10

they «claim is being violated, and the only statute, the .

1!

National Bank Act, was not intended for their protection? and

12

they admit this, implicitly, at least? that they have standing

13

to complain of violations of the National Bank Act on the

14

basis of a statute which on its face does not apply to bank

15

service corporations.

16

Circumstances where the Congress, both Congressional

17

Committees were informed that banks were engaging in this

18

activity and not only does the. Act not refer to banks in this

19

context, but there wasn't one single suggestion in the Com­

20

mittee Report of either Committee that this was an activity

21

that should legislated against.

22
23

Q

What was the original motive power that led to

the Bank Servicing Act.

24

A

Yen mean the motivation for the Act?

25

Q

Yes „
25

1

A

It was considered in 1962,, both by the Comp­

2

troller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board, that a

-J

O

bank was precluded — absolutely precluded from owning stock;

4

in another corporation.

S

Corporation Act was to enable to invest in these bank service

6

corporations so that the banks

7

could combine to obtain'the advantage of — among other

8

things, automated facilities, which individually they could

9

not have purchased.

The purpose of the Bank Service

particularly small ones

10

The whole motivation of the Act, indeed, was to

n

provide an assistance to banks, not to inxpo&e any kind of

12

restrictions that are not already there.

1.3

Representative Multer, who is a senior member of the Banking

14

and Currency Committee really admonished against the kind of

15

approach which the Petitions advance here in a quotation

16

which appears in the amicus curiae brief of the American

17

Banker's Association on Page 12.

18

he specifically indicates that he Wants to make it abundantly

19

clear that this bill was not intended to go outside of the

20

very language appearing in the bill and goes on to say that it

21

will not interfere with any authority now vested in banks

22

and that it simply sets up a new means by which individual

2a0

banks can acquire these additional services.

24

this restriction was put in which limits the Bank Service

I had in mind what Judge Bailey Aldrich says about the

motivation.

11

12
13

motivation came from the National Society of Public Accoun­
tants who were afraid of the competition; who didn't want the
competition.
A.

tion of the Congressional adoption of this provision was to
just get that Bank Service Corporation Act.

18
19

It was in the

form of a compromise.
Q

Well, but you compromise with what interests

on the other side?
A

16
17

It was initially spearheaded by that group but

I think that, if Your Honor pleases, that the actual motiva­

I haven't independently looked at the legislative

history but he — at least it was very clear tohim that that

Mow, wh^fe was the motivation for that Section

Well, I don’t think there is any indication,

beyond Senator Proxmire, of an interest in data processing
companies but even so, the interest was reflected only in the
context of the activities of the Bank Service Corporation
itself.

20

Now, I wish to stress again that, as is set out in
21

22

somelength in the amicus brief of the American Banker's
/

*

Association, there have been several bills before the Congress
23

since 1962 in which there has been, —in connection with which
24

there has been a request, usually spearheaded by ADAPSO, that
25

there be a prohibition directly imposed upon banks with
respect to data processing service activities.

14

17
18

I don't recall, Mr. Chief Justice, whether* there is

The whole thrust, really of the Majority views of thi
two committees is that this is an act which is designed to
legislate in the area of bank service corporations, and not in
any other area.

And we think that it really is not an appro­

19

priate basis for carrying over this statute into another area

20

and allowing it to be used as a statutory aid standing to

21

question activity under a statute which was not intended to

22

protect the competitor who is bringing the charge.

23
24
25

Q

Mr.Rosenthal, as I understood you in answer to

a question of Mr. Justice Harlan, you said that if the facts
of this case were that a bank service corporation was

28

j

1

performing these services for a hardware store directly, yet

a

that these Petitioners would still not have standing?
A

3

No, You,3;? Honor.

I suggested that possibility.

4

All I meant to say was that that would be a much closer case.

5

There they well might be found to have standing and or the

6

other hand there was an argument at least, that they would

7

lack standing.
But that, again, I want to stress is a completely

different situation than the one which is before the Court
herea where they are not invoking as the basis —

10
Q

The Bank Service Corporation Act; I understand

A

That*s another statute.

T?
12

that.

13
I will only add, if the Court pleases, that for the
14

reasons that I have held in our brief we do not believe that
15
there is any reason why this Court should adopt the alterna­
16
tive suggestion of Petitioners that the rule of Armand,
17
Tennessee Power and Hardin be discarded,
18
We think that that rule does not, as Petitioners
19

suggest, we think the rule does not leave the public interest
20
unprotected.

We think what it does do is leave it to the

21

Congress .and appropriately so , to determine where the super-

22
intendents of administrative action should be in both circum­

23
stances where the claimant can point to the invasion of no
24
legally-protected right.

We think that fundamentally what the role is —■' the

4

it is prefectly appropriate for Congress to make the decision

5

as to whether it wishes the Court to extend judicial review

6

to those who, like these Petitioners £. ca±. claim solely an

7

aggrieved fact.
Q

8
9

Hr. Rosenthal, do you think Flast against

Cohan would have any bearing on this situation?
A

10

Flast and Cohen, Mr. Justice Harlan, we believe

11

to be fully consistent with the standing basis upon which we

12

rely.
In Flast and Cohen this Court held that so far as

13
14

idle Article III requirement of the case in controversy was

15

concerned, it was enough that there be a substantial personal

15

stake.

17

where there was obviously a. legal right involved.

18

Court construed the First Amendment an individual has a right

19

to legally-protected — constitutionally-protected right to

20

be free from having his tax monies expended for or in the

21

furtherance of a religious purpose.

22

But the Court there was confronted with a situation
As the

I would only add that in just last June this Court

23

in Jenkins versus McKeifchen, the opinion of Mr. Justice

24

Marshall specifically indicated, referring to Flast against

25

Cohen, that something more than adversary interest is necessary
30

1

to confer 'standing..

2

him between the official action challenged and some legally-

3

protected interest — challenging that action.

There, must be* ,in addition* some .connec-

4

And while Mr, Justice Marshall's opinion again was

5

for himself and two other justices* as we have read the con­

S

curring and dissenting opinions* there was no disagreement or

7

misinterpretation of Flast.

3
9

And we would submit* if the Court pleases, that in
this case Petitioners have not established the requisite

10

connection between the official action which they challenge and

11

the action of the Comptroller interpreting the. National Bank

12

Act, some legally-protected interest which they possess.
But* insofar as the National Bank Act is concerned,

13
14

as they admit themselves* competitors have no legally-protected

13

interest,
;

16
17

For these reasons, we respectfully submit that the
judgment of the Court below should be affirmed.
