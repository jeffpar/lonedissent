amicus brief on my side of the case.

14
15

In rebuttal, or as part of j

We will leave it up to you

gentlemen.
MR. DuBOIS:

This case involves convictions under

Section 174 of Title 21 of the United States Cede, and Section
4704(a) of Title 26 of the United States Code relating to two
narcotic drugs, specifically heroin and cocaine.
It is the contention of the petitioner that the presumptions contained in both of these sections of the code ar©
unconstitutional because they discourage the right of a defendant
3

?

to remain silent, and specifically, we rely heavily upon the

2

two relatively recent decisions of this Court which are cited

3

in the brief of petitioner, namely, Griffin versus California
and United States versus Jackson.
Without repeating in detail, all of the argument con­

©

tained in the brief, I would like to emphasize certain points
for consideration of the Court.

8

First, Section 174 of Title 21 of the United States

9

Code requires that the defendant know that the narcotic drugs

10

in question "to have been imported or brought into the United

?i

States contrary to law."
In the Government's brief, it is claimed that it is

12
13

rational to permit the jury in this cavsa to infer that a person

14

in possession of a relsitively large araount of heroin knows that

15

it was illegally imported.

16

ment's brief quotes from but then eipparently ignores the charge

In making this argument, the Govern­

17

of the District Court Judge in which the Judge said specific­

18

ally, and I quote, "Now, obviously there is no evidence in this

19

case that this particular defendant knew that this cocaine and

20

this heroin had been imported into the United States contrary tc

21

law."

22
23
24
25

The District Court Judge then went on to s'ay, "The
statute, recognizing the impossibility of proving knowledge in
these cases, and having in mind the welfare of the people, which
is the purpose of the Food and Drug Act, says that all you have

4

I

1

to do, all the Government has to do, Is show there was posses­

2

sion of this drug by the defendant on trial, and that evidence

3

shall suffice to authorise, a ..violation of the statute unless»•

4

by the witnesses presented, possession of the drugs by the defer

B

dant» 'under those circumstances» was satisfactorily explained tc

6

the jury.

7

It is abundantly clear, therefore, that under the in­

&

structions from the District Court Judge, the jury did not in­

9

dulge in any rationalisation such as that contained in the

to­

Government8s brief, namely, the jury, under the Judge8s instruc­

ti

tions, certainly did not indulge in the presumption that because

n

there was a large amount of heroin that, therefore, the defers-

13

dant knew it was illegally imported, because the Judge told the

14

jury, "All you have to find, gentlemen, is possession.”

15

So I feel that the whole argument in the Government's

m

brief concerning the so-called the rational inference, in order

ii

to be drawn by the jury, by the possession of this large amount

m

of heroin, is completely immaterial.

19

Secondly, -the Government's brief .on supplemental

20

memorandum spent a great deal of time in pointing out that

21

heroin is neither produced in the United States nor legally

22

imported into the United States.

23

late this fact, it is our position that this statement leads to

24

25

nowhere.

Now, even assuming we stipu­

Certainly if this is true, before reading the Govern­

ment's brief, and there certainly is no evidence in this case

5

;

1

that the defendant knew this to be true.

2

already indicated, the District Court Judge specifically charged

In fact, as I have

3

Obviously there is no evidence in this case that this

4

particular defendant knew that this cocaine and heroin had been

S

imported into the United States contrary to law.

8

Q

Unless I am mistaken, hasn9t the Government con­

7

ceded the count relates to the cocaine, so far as the presump­

8

tion is concerned?

9
30

n
tz
33

A

I beg your pardon.

Under the Section 174 of

Title 21, the Government did concede the cocaine.
Q

So you can direct this part of your argument

entirely to heroin,
A

Yes, right.

It is our contention that the pre­

14

sumption, then, that the mere possession of a narcotic drug is

35

sufficient evidence of a violation of Section 174 of Title 21

16

requiring that the defendant know the drugs have been imported

17

contrary to law is unconstitutional.

18
19
.20

21

22
23
24
25

To use the words; of the Griffin case, it cuts down
on the privilege by making the assumption of the right, to remain
silent costly, and to use the words of the Jackson case, it
chills the assertion of that right.
It is to be noted that in the Jackson case, the defen­
dant pleaded not guilty and demanded a jury trial, but this
Court still said that ths provision in the Federal Kidnapping
Act that permits him to get a death sentence if he asks for a
6

i

I

jury trial is unconstitutional because it chilled his right to

2

plead not guilty and to ask for a jury trial, and we say that;

3

the right to remain silent is just as precious as the right to

4

demand a jury trial and the right to plead not guilty*
With respect to the convictions under Section 4704(a)

S
s

of Title 28 of the United States Code, here, again, it is tha

7

contention of the petitioner that the presumption contained in

&

this section of the code providing that mare possession of the

9

drugs is prima facie evidence of a violation of the section is

m

unconstitutional, again because it discourages the right of the

n

defendant to remain silent*

tz

It is to be noted

and this is not brought out* at

13

least in the Government’s brief — that whereas the indictments

«4

under this section of the code charge the defendant with unlaw­

25

ful purchase, possesion, dispensing and distributing of nar­

IS

S7

cotic drugs, and whereas a judgment of conviction recites posses
sion as well as purchase and dispensing and distributing, in

18

fact, this section does not make the possession of narcotic drug^

19

a crime*

20
2!

22
23

24
25

Specifically, said statute says that it shall be un­
lawful to purchase, sell, dispense or disdribute narcotic drugs
except in the original stamped package.

Then the statute pro­

vides, as I have indicated, the possession shall be prima facie
evidence of violation.

There is absolutely^no evidence in this

case that the defendant purchased, sold, dispensed or distributed

7

1

narcotic drugs and here# again, the charge of the District. Court

2

Judge, to me, is almost conclusive.

3

He said to the jury:

"So that, in effect, your problem, your principal

4

problem here will be fc determine whether or not certain

5

quantities of heroin and cocaine which have been marked in

6

evidence in this case were in the possession of or under fcfc e

7

control of the defendant in this case."

'b

Here, again, the jury was instructed, in effect, that

8
9

so long as the defendant was found to be in possession of the

10

drugs, that was all that was needed.

n

obviously must have determined guilt solely on the basis of

12

possession.

And here, again, the jury

13

In closing, we say that the presumptions in both of

14

these sections of the statute are unconstitutional and we be­

IS

lieve that the decisions of this Court in the Griffin case and

16

the Jackson case dictate that those presumptions be declared

17

uncons txtufcional.

18

Thank you very much.

ARGUMENT OF STEVEN R. RIVKXN, ESQ.

21

AMICUS CURIAE FOR CLEVELAND BURGESS
MR. RIVKXN:

Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

There are other issues in this case beyond the issue of

self-incrimination arising from the statutory presumptions on
which the petitioner has rested.
8

t

Because of the presence of these issues, I have filed

2

on behalf of the amicus two briefs in this case and 1 would now

3

like to make this brief supplementary argument.

4
5

1 want to dwell on the issue that was preserved in
the Leary case last term for resolution here, the constitution­
ality under the due process clause of the statutory presumption

1

8
9
10

in 2.1 U.S.C. Section 174 with respect to hard narcotics.
Then, time permitting, 1 would like to point briefly
to the other arguments posed in the briefs of the amicus.
The Leary case invalidated.the virtually identical

SI

statutory presumption in 21 U.S.C. 176 |a} similarly involving a

n

statutory inference arising from mere possession of foreign

13

importation and knowledge thereof with respect to marijuana,

14

and it has specifically left for a future case separate con­

IS

sideration of -the similar question with respect to hard drugs.

W

Subsequent to the Leary case, and in response to the

n

briefs filed in this ease, the Government has conceded error

is

with respect to the drug cocaine and has prayed for reversal

19

on Count 3.

20

has dissolved now any line remaining after Leary between mari­

21

juana and hard drugs.

22

By so doing, it is our position that the Government

Applying the tests of that in prior cases to the drug

23

heroin, the remaining drug in the petitioner's possession, 21

24

U.S.C. Section 174 is embraced fully within the prohibition, of

25

the duo process clause.
9

?

This Court has always given deference to the ability

2

of Congress to fashion evidentiary rules, but that deference

3

has always bean based, as set forth in the Tot case, on the

4

Congress' ability to see the facts of a particular case in

5

broader relationship than that which might be presented to the

6

jury.

7

It should be noted at the outset here that what the

8

Congress was doing in 1909, when it passed the Import and Export

9

Act with respect to narcotic drugs, was ’Working a total pro™

10

hibifcion against the import and on the domestic possession and

U

use of heroin»

12

tionship of facts, such as the Congress was doing in the statute

S3

which was involved in the Gainey case and in the Romano case,

14

26 U.S.C, 5601, in which it was determined that because of the

15

tendency of stills to bs located in hidden places, that there

16

may be assumed to be a relationship with regard to anyone who

17

is found present thereat.

It was not making a judgment of a common rela­

18

Therefore, realising that we must look behind the

19

normal deference which is to be accorded to the Congress in

20

these matters, we must apply to these presumptions the tests

21

which have bean most recently stated in Leary and which have

22

also been stated in Tot.

23

rational connection between the fact in evidence and the fact

24

23

Those tests are that there be a

presumed therefrom based on a connection in common experience
and capable of giving rise to substantial assurance that the

presumed fact is more.likely than hot to flow from the fact in

3

If we apply these tests to the possession here in

4

question, both logically and empirically in respect to 21‘U.3.C.

5

174, we must some to a conclusion -that we cannot reach substan­

Q

tial assurance that there is a rational connection between the

7

fact in evidence and the facts — unlawful importation and

S

knowledge thereof — which Congress would have the courts pre­

9'

sume c

19

With respect to unlawful importation, there are at

n

least four alternatives for -the source of heroin in the posses­

ia

sion of petitioner®

13

to the statute 21 U.S.C® Section 513, by which heroin and any

24

ether drug may, in fact, be lawfully imported into the United

25

States, lawfully imported for scientific purposes, and for sub­

16

sequent license, but I would warrant that if petitioner Turner

27

and any other possessor of heroin had come in possession of such

18

a drug without such a license, he could not be prosecuted under

29

this statute®

This morning Mr® Strauss made reference

20

The second source would be lawful importation of sourc

21

material and subsequent deviation and manufacture of that source

22
23
24
2S

material into heroin®

The source material commonly acknowledged

for heroin, derived as it is, ultimately, from the opium poppy,
is raw opium and morphine®

As I have pointed out in my brief,

there is also evidence which the Government does not contradict.
11

1

indeed it confirms, that codeine may also be a source for heroinj.

2

Using the Government statistics which the Government

3

has applied as the basis for concluding in this case that cocaina

4

may, in fact, not be unlawfully imported into the United States,

3

we come to a conclusion that there is a rather high potential

6

of domestic manufacture of the heroin drug.
The Government concedes both the possibility and the

7

a

technical ease with which heroin may be manufactured.

s

Government11 s reports mention efforts to manufacture heroin, and

The

10

moreover, the Government, both Federal and State, have attempted

11

to prosecute people for the effort of manufacturing heroin from

12

source materials otherwise present in the United States.

13

Moreover, the recent concern of the Bureau of Narcotic

14

and Drug Abuse for cough syrups which have low traces of codeine

15

within them, and for paregoric, which contains opium, suggest

'18

that the source material for the substance in the possessor of

17

heroin5s hands may be as handy as the local supermarket or drug

18

store.

19

The third element,which I would suggest is present to

20

vitiate the assurance of unlawful importation is that the opium

21
2£
23
24
25

poppy may have been grown in the United States.

Indeed, that

prospect was, itself, the basis on which Congress passed the
Narcotics Control Acts in the early part of the century.

The

Government has acknowledged that it is agriculturally possible
to grow opium in the United States.

12

1

Moreover, there is a regime of Federal control and

z

licensing over the opium poppy in the United States, and there

3

have been prosecutions reported, which are cited in my brief,

4

for individuals who have attempted to grow that product»
The Government, moreover, in its brief, has also con­

5

6

firmed that there are instances where opium is grown today in

7

the United States»
Q

8

You suggest that the Government, or the Congress,

§

in order to establish this presumption, must negate every pos­

10

sible source, or is the presumption supportable if, on balance,

II

it is more probable than not that it is an imported substance?

So I would say even if there were a

51 percent requirement, one must feel quite sure, in fact to a
point that one might speak of as to a moral certainty, that the j

States.
Q

Has any ease ever held that it had to be to a

presumption here, is more or less offensive than the common law

arising from the possession of recently stolen property, unex­

%

plained possession?

10

I would say, Your Honor, it does in terms that

substance.

Yes, Your Honor.
•«

Q

13

In other words,, you could live with the other.,

14

common law presumption, but you thihk that is not as offensive

15

as the statutory presumption here.
A

16
17

In the light of the showings which I am making

here, Your Honor, I think that is the circumstance.
Finally, I would add there is also the prospect that

18

19

the drug might be wholly snythesized in the United States from

20

sources which are unregulated and which are commonly available.

21

22
23
24
25

This possibility has been acknowledged by the Government in its
briefs.
On balance, the Government has attempted to come to
grips with these alternatives, and they have concluded in their
own terms that if heroin is available in the United States,
14

1

domestically manufactured and produced, that the likelihood is

2

less than one percent*

3

one must be aware t? when one judges the validity of this projec­

4

tion, of the sources from which the Government's data are drawn.

5

Those-sources can only be, in these circumstances? the., lists anc

the price*

Q

I am still, along with the Chief Justice, worried)
.

19
20

21
22
23
24

25

about how far the Government has to prove their point.
A

We are concerned with a criminal ease.

As a

criminal case, it is a further question of the degree to which
the Government may chop down on a defendant’s rights, and that
is, 2 would say, up around the realm of a reasonable doubt, be- j
yond a reasonable doubt.

I would not want to put a quantitative

test involved here, but I certainly would not say that the
IS

!

statistics that have been introduced here substantiate that.

Z

If the statistics do substantiate that, with substantial assur­

3

ance, then it is a proposition which our cases would embrace„

4

But the fact is that the most authoritative judgment

5

that has ever been made about the validity of these statistics

6

was made recently by the White House Conference on Narcotics

7

and Drug Abuse, when it was specifically stated as follows:
"Adequate data are not available for a precise esti­

8

mation of the incidence and prevalence of the abusive

9
10

drugs with psycholotoxic side effects. Because addicts, fox

It

the most part, obtain their drugs illegally, existing data

12

are both unreliable and incomplete and are generally

23

limited to individuals apprehended by enforcement agencies.
The White House panel necessarily concluded:

14

"The

15

discrepancies between Federal, state and local enforcement

m

agencies are so great in some instances, more than 100 percent,

17

that the panel prefers not to make any numerical estimates at

18

this time."
The time was 1962.

19

The White House Conference on

20

Narcotics and Drug Abuse, and the citation is to page 290 and

21

291.

22

Indeed, even if one makes the assumption that this

23

Court made, without determining the issues in the Leary case,

24

that most heroin is imported to the United States, one must also

25

look beyond that to the question of whether the second part of
16

u

\

the presumption here concerned has met a rational test; that' is,

z

whether most users of heroin in the United States know that

3

their drugs haves a foreign importation.

4

used in the Leary case was that a majority of possessors of a

5

narcotic drug must know of the high rate of importation or of

6

the actual origin of the drug.

In fact, the language

The Government has attempted; wrongly I submit, to

1

substantiate that necessary showing of knowledge, and it has

9

done it solely by pointing to widespread television and news­

10

paper notoriety,

I would submit that that offering goes nowhere

SI

near as far as Leary teaches the Government must go.

12

authoritative sources which are cited in my brief show that

13

the heroin user, by and large, is poor, disadvantaged, psycho­

14

logically an escapist, and far from the sophisticated person

15

from whom one might expect the knowledge of the importation of

16

the drug.

In fact;

On balance, I submit that both presumptions —foreign

17
IS

importation and knowledge thereof -- fail to meet the rational

19

connection test which -this Court has applied.

30

If the Court has questions, I would like to —

I would like to ask you one question,

Put in that manner, Mr. Justice Black, I would

respond affirmatively, and indeed, it is my further contention,
1
as you have pointed out in your dissent in Gainey, in your con-

16

eurring opinion in Romano, and in Leary, that these presumptions

17

work a deprivation of due process of law by converting the

reasonable doubt test, which must be met, they interfere with

19

the right of a defendant to a trial by jury, in addition to the

20

self-incriminatory aspects which the counsel for the petitioner

has pointed out.

ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE , ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. WALLACE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;

5

Petitioner stands convicted, after a jury trial, on

6

four counts of narcotics violations and he petitioned this

7

Court

8

as of the so-called statutory presumptions of the two Federal

9

narcotics laws under which he was convicted.

to review the constitutional validity as applied to him

m

The question of the constitutionality of the presump­

n

tions was the only question he put before the Court of Appeals,

12

13

and it was the only question in the petition for certiorari, and
*
^
in our view--of the case under this Court’s rules, therefore, no

14

other issues are raised apart from the validity of the presump­

IS

tions,

16

I anticipate directing the argument to.

17

and that is what we have directed our brief to and what

Because no other issues are raised, the facts of record

18

pertinent in this Court are few, but I think they sire worth re­

18

viewing for purposes of addressing ourselves to the trial judge's

20

charge to the jury, as well as to the validity of applying the

2!

presumptions in this case.

22

Federal narcotics agents arrested the petitioner and

23

two traveling companions at a Lincoln Tunnel toll booth in New

24

Jersey shortly after their automobile emerged in the course of

25

a trip from New York City, and the atifcomobile was registered in
21

1

petitioner’s name.

z

While the agents were conducting a search of the

s

arrested individual, and prior to their actual search of peti­

4

tioner 8s person, he threw a metal foil package containing

5

cocaine to the top of a nearby wall»

6

then revealed another metal foil package containing heroin undei

7

the front seat.
The first package weighed 14-2/3 grains and contained

®
9

A search of the automobile

a mixture of cocaine and sugar, five percent of which was coca.tr e.

10

The package containing heroin weighed 48-1/4 grans and consisted

I!

of a mixture of several substances, 15.2. percent of which was

1Z

heroin.

13

The heroin mixture was divided into 275 small glassine

U

double bags, all wrapped within the metal foil package, and none

15

of the containers had any tax stamps affixed.

16
17
IS
19

On the basis of this evidence, petitioner was con­
victed of a heroin violation and of a cocaine violation under
each of the two statutes set forth at pages 2 and 3 of our brief
Under Section 174 of Title 21, he was convicted of

20

having knowingly received, concealed and facilitated the trans­

21

portation of each drug after its illegal importation, with the

22

knowledge that it had been illegally imported.

23
24

2S

Under Section 4704(a) of Title 26, he was convicted
of having knowingly purchased, possessed and distributed each
drug not in or from the original stamped package.
22

t

Ha was given concurrent sentences of imprisonment

2

on the two heroin counts to run consecutively,, with concurrent

3

sentences on the two cocaine counts.

4

Under each of these statutes, the trial court in-

S

strueted the jury in the statutory language that under Section

S

174, it was authorised to convict if the defendant was shown

7

to have been in possession of the drug and has not explained

8

his possession to the jury's satisfaction.

9

authorised t© convict if the drug were shown to be in the

10

Under 4704, it was

.defendant's possession without appropriate tax stamps affixed.

II

These so-called statutory presumptions authorised

12

but did not require the jury to infer the additional elements

13

of each crime from the Government's proof in this case, and the

14

issue before this Court is whether it was constitutionally

IS

permissible to apply these presumptions to each of the four

16

counts.

17

The issue is not a novel one in this Court, because

28

the constitutionality of each of these statutory presumptions

19

has previously been upheld in this Court's decisions, that of

20

Section 174 in Yee Hem against the United States in Volume 268

2'i

U.S.,

22

States in Volume 276 U.S.

23

and that of Section 4704(a) in Casey against the United

In a series of more resent decisions, beginning v/ith

m

Tot against the United States, and continuing with Gainey and

25

Romano, ©nd most recently, last term's decision in Leary, the
23

1

Court has more searchingly analyzed and refined the standard

2

for determining the constitutional validity of criminal statu-

3

tory presumptions *

4

A consistent theme of all of these decisions is that

5

a distinction legitimately may be made between the evidence

8

relating to a particular defendant and the question of what

7

inferences in general may properly be drawn from the proof of

8

certain facts, and that as to the. latter issue, Congress may

0

properly bring to bear its resources and its wisdom, may bring

10

to bear what this Court referred to in Gainey as the capacity

11

of Congress to amass the stuff of actual experience and cull

12

conclusions from, it so as to provide statutory guides that will

13

contribute to consistency in the administration of justice and

14

that will, in most cases, enable the trial to be focused on

15

the evidence relating to the particular defendant without the

16

distraction and the burden of introducing proof in every case

17

concerning complex matters of general application, such as the

18

details amassed in the briefs in this case about the narcotics

19

trade in general, and its possible relation to the scientific

20

properties of the various drugs.

2!

Of course,

-Congress has not foreclosed either party

22

from introducing expert testimony or other evidence tending in

23

general to vitiate or to substantiate statutory presumptions,

24

but this is rarely done.

25

In the series of cases I mentioned -----

24

t
2

Q

■that Congress couldn't foreclose that.

A

3
4

Of course, I suppose the Government would admit

We need not admit it, because Congress has not

attempted to foreclose that.

5

Q

1 wouIchi51 think it would deny.

6

h

In the series of casas 1 mentioned, this Court

7

has developed the standard for testing the constitutionality of

8

criminal statutory presumptions in terras of whether there is a

9

rational connection between the fact proved, and the ultimate

10

fact presumed* or as it -was restated last terra in Leary, a

It

criminal statutory presumption must be regarded as irrational

12

or arbitrary and, hence, unconstitutional unless it can foe at

IS

least said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact

14

is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which

15

i.t is made to depend.
Under this standard, we contend as to three of the

16
17

counts here that the application of the presumptions was

18

rational, and as to the remaining count under which petitioner

19

was convicted, we concede that this requirement was not met

20

and that petitioner's conviction under that count should be re­

2?

versed.

Supposing you had to defend these presumptions’

on a. reasonable doubt standard, which was reserved in Leary.
What would you say?
A

That would have to foa submitted to- the--jury, as
25

1

the instructions of the trial judge did put the case to the

2

jury, that they had to be convinced by the Government evidence

3

beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the elements of the crime

4

had been made out»
The statutory presumptions are'just another form of

5

recognizing that circumstantial evidence can toe put to the jury

7

under proper reasonable doubt instructions.

tribution.
A

That was the way the indictment was phrased?

Q

And the statute is "or", isn't it?

yes, sir.

I gather from t!his

indictment that the conviction was for purchase, sale and dis­

A

16

Q

That is correct.
I take it if this inference is invalid, under

17

the indictment and conviction, on the tax stamps, as to either

18

purchase, sale or distribution, then the conviction must be

19

reversed.
A

20

I don't believe that is the law.

Under this

21

Court's decisions, indictments always have to be phrased in the

22

conjunctive rather than in the alternative, and then if any of

23

the crimes are made out, that is sufficient to uphold the con­

24

viction .

Q

You suggested that Count 4 not be reversed»

11

A

That is correct.

12

Q

That deals with cocaine, the cocaine inference

13

with respect to the tax stamps, whether possession indicates

U

sales, distribution or acquisition without tax stamps.

15

that shouldn’t be reversed®

You say

16

A

That is correct.

17

Q

Because in this case possession is ample infer­

18

19
20
21

22
23

24
25

ence, is ample basis for concluding those facts.
A

That he purchased the cocaine not in or from a

stamped package, and that is included in the indictment.
Q

And you say, then, that if that inference on

these facts is good as to either acquisition, sals or distribu­
tion, the conviction stands.
A

Yes, sir.

Wa further urge that except as it may serve to raise
27

1

a.belated challenge to the trial court's instructions, petition-

2

er's reliance on the self-incrimination in challenging the

3

presumptions should be regarded in this case as not really add­

4

ing anything to the established rational connection test of

5

their validity, and since we also contend that the jury instruc­

6

tions were adequate, we conclude that the verdict of guilty

7

should be sustained as to the three counts in which the statutos

8

presumptions were rationally applied.

9

Turning first to the two heroin counts f we contend

to

that both statutory presumptions were validly applied to the

Vi

evidence of possession of that drug.

sion of the 275 bags of heroin, both that the heroin was illegally

U

imported and that petitioner knew of its illegal importation.

15

We have documented in our brief, and in our supple­

15

mental memorandum, the reasons why, in contrast to the facts

17

concerning marijuana which ware before this Court last term in

18

Leary, on the basis of the best information available, available

19

within the Government, available in scientific publications,

20

available in the reports of the United Nations Commission on

21

22
23
24
25

Narcotic Drugs, and available in the recent report of the Task
Force on Narcotic and Drug Abuse of the President's Commission
on Laxtf Enforcement and Administration of Justice, the first
part of this presumption that the heroin was illegally imported
should be regarded as simply reflecting the actuality that heroin
28

1

is neither produced nor legally imported into the United States

a

We have, in that written presentation, carefully con­

s

sidered and responded to every speculative possibility commendatly

4

suggested by counsel for amicus in this .case as an alternative

5

source to illegal importation, and we have demonstrated that

6

none of these alternatives could realistically account for more

7

than & negligible fraction of the total supply of heroin in

8

this country.
To the best of our knowledge, virtually all, and at

3
m

least 99 percent of the heroin in the United States was illegally

n

imported»

12

as a matter of common sense, that since all heroin is illegally

13

imported, or virtually all, a jury may rationally infer, and thus

14

may be authorised by Congress to infer, that a parson in posses-

IS

sion of 275 bags of heroin knows that it was illegally imported.

16

It then follows, in the words ©£ the Leary opinion,

The drawing of such an inference by .the jury from the

17

conduct of the accused and the circumstances of the ease is,

18

after all, the ordinary way in our accusatorial system of

19

justice!, in which it is determined whether the accused had the

ZQ

requisite knowledge or other mental attributes, such as specific

24
25

intent, when such a mental attribute is an element of a crime.

reference to the principle that possession of the fruits of

2

the possession is guilty possession*, knowledge if frequently

inferred from the circumstances of the ease in situations com-

4

parable to that contemplated by this statute, and this is widely

5

done in both State and Federal law,, for example in the enforce­

6

ment of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act, the so-called Dyer

7

Act,

8

In the words this Court used in Gainey , for Congress

9

to authorise the jury to do this is to authorise it to do no

10

more than accord to the evidence, if unexplained, its natural

If

probative force.

12

We also contend that the presumption in 'the tax stamp

13

statute validly applied to petitioner's possession of the heroir

U

since, as we have documented in our brief, heroin is not avail­

15

able in tax stamp packages, there is no way petitioner could

16

have procured it in or from the original stamped package, and

17

it follows that Congress could constitutionally authorise the

18

jury to infer from his possession of the heroin, that he had

19

purchased it in violation of the tax stamp statute, which in

20

contrast to Section 174, does not include specific knowledge

21

as an element of the offense.

22

i

As to the cocaine counts, we first concede that the

23

application of the Section 174 presumption to petitioner's

24

possession of the relatively small amount of cocaine involved

25

in this case was not warranted under the constitutional standard
33

3

explained and applied last terra in Leary,

2

contrast to heroin, there are, as indicated in our brief and

3

its appendix, substantial quantities of cocaine stolen from

4

legitimate sources in this country every year, while comparison

of these figures with the admittedly rough estimates set forth

ties of cocaine annually smuggled into this country might justif ¥

a

an inference teat the cocaine found in the illicit trade was,

9

in fact, illegally imported, we do not believe that the further

This is because in

30

knowledge of its illegal importation meets the Leary standard

n

in such a case as the present one involving less than three-

12

quarters of a gram of cocaine,

13

Q

The practical result of that concession would be

14

what — that, automatically five years comes off that total

IS

sentence, or that the Court* in case we agree with you on the

16

rest*-of'.your argument, remand to the sentencing judge to re-

17

sentence entirely?

m
i©
20
21

h

I would say the latter, Mr, Justice.

Otherwise,

the reversal just eliminates a part-of the concurrent sentence,
Q

It 'would eliminate a 10-year sentence, which is

running concurrently with a five-year sentece,

22

A

That is correct.

23

Q

Practically, it would reduce a total 20-year

24

25

sentence to a total 15-year sentence, as I understand it.
■* t
A
That is correct. Either alternative would
34

1

accomplish the seme thing;, presumably, and I think either would

z

be an acceptable procedure.

3

We do not contend that this conviction met the Leary

4

standard, but in conceding this, we do contend that this Court,

3

need not and should not now decide whether the Section 174 pre­

S

sumption could validly be applied to possession of cocaine in

7

an amount so large as not reasonably likely to have been aggre­

8

gated from individual thefts, or in other circumtances pointing

9

to a foreign source.
There is no necessity in this case to decide whether

10
11

the presumption can ever validly be applied.
We urge, on the other hand, that the tax stamp pre­

12

13

sumption was validly applied to petitioner’s possession of the

14

cocaine in circumstances of this case, as we have elaborated

15

in our

16

brief.
Turning now to petitioner’s claims based on the privi"

17

lege against self-incrimination, we recognize that when a

?8

statutory presumption is applied without adequate rational

19

foundation, as we concede was the case as to one count here,

20

one way of articulating the constitutional infirmity is to say

2s

that, so applied, the presumption impermissibly impaired defen­

22

dant’s right to remain silent, and thus violated his Fifth

23

Amendment privilege.

24

23

When, however, such a presumption is applied in com­
pliance with the standard of rationality established by this
35

1

Court, then the alleged coercion to testify stems not from any

2

unconstitutional compulsion, but from the legitimate force of

3

the Government’s case.

4

for the defendant to be faced with evidence justifying a rational

5

inference of guilt, and to have to decide whether, despite

6

attendant risks of doing so, he will testify in an effort to

7

overcome the force of that, evidence.

It is not uncommon in a criminal trial

There is no reason relevant to the policies of the
privilege of self-incrimination for holding that the status of

10

such a defendant differs, depending on whether the jury’s infer­

IS

ence of guilt is authorised by a judge-made rule of evidence,

12

or by a rationally -warranted statutory provision,

13

instance, as the Gainey opinion recognised, the courts have the

14

same responsibility to decide whether the Government has made a

IS

submissible case, and if the Government's evidence meets that

36

standard, as we contend it did here with respect to three

17

counts, submission of the case to the jury does not violate

18

the constitutional privilege, as this Court definitively held

19

in Yee Hem against the United States in the passage quoted on

20

page 36 of our brief.

Turning finally to the instructions to the jury,

22

although petitioner did not except to them at the trial, and did

23

not request that the jury be charged not to draw any adverse

24

inference from his failure to testify, he now contends that the •

23

reading of the statutory inferences to the jury in the course of
36

1

z

the instructions constituted adverse comment on his silence»
Substantially the same contention was properly rejected

3

by this Court in Gainey, in "which very similar instructions to

4

the jury were upheld in a situation involving a similar statu­

5

tory presumption.

©

It is true there were passages in the instructions

7

which were read by counsel for the petitioner which have to be

8

understood in the context of the trial, in which the matter put

9

in issue by the defense was the question of possession.

That

10

was what they were contesting at the trial, and naturally the

11

trial judge emphasized to the jury that that was the crucial

12

issue for them to decide.

13

But here, as in Gainey, reading the instructions as

14

a whole, the jury was

15

ences from the unexplained circumstantial evidence presented by

16

the Government, and the jury was specifically admonished that

17

they were to be the sole and exclusive judges of the facts and

18

that the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was

19

on the Government, notwithstanding the statutory presumptions.

While it might have been better practice, as the
Gainey opinion suggests, to omit from the charge any explicit
reference to the statutory provisions authorising the inferences
the instructions as given were adequate, especially in the ab­
sence of an exception, and do not differ significantly from
those upheld in Gainey.

It is, therefore, our position that except as to

Count 3, this Court should affirm the judgment upholding the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSIAH E. DuBOIS, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

MR. DuBOIS %

I just want to say that the Yee Hem and

11

Casey decisions were decided before Jackson,, and reading the

12

Yee Hem decision, particularly the part quoted in the-Government 5 s

13

brief, and the Jackson, decision, is like .day and night. *

Secondly, I would like to say that the ' arguissent here'
still seems gocrl in view of the fact that the lower court judge
said obviously there is no evidence that this defendant knew
that this cocaine or heroin had been unlawfully imported, and
then he added that the statute recognises the impossibility of
proving that.

It is right in his charge..

Thirdly, I merely point out, as I did 'before, that the
section relating to stamps does not make possession & crime,
although the indictment contained the word "possession" and
the conviction contained the word "possession".
Thank you.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. DuBois.

Mr. Rivkin and Mr. Wallace, thank you for your
submissions.'

The case is submitted.

S

entitled matter was concluded.)
