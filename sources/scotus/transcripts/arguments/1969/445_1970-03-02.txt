ORAL ARGUMENT BY L WALTON BADER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. BADER:

Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please

8

the Court:

9

was entered into between the Petitioner, Standard Industries,

10

This case involves a patent license agreement which

and the Respondent Tigrett. Industries.

11

The agreement provided that Standard Industries was

12

to pay, in effect, a royalty of 5 percent of the covered pro­

13

duct sales price., which is the way the contract read.

14

contract provided also the usual warranty of title.

15

patent warrent, in fact, in the name of Tigrett Industries, but

16

the assignment was a conditional one.

And the
The

The agreement of assignment between Tigrett Industries

17

18

and the inventor provided that the assignment would become

19

absolutely void if Tigrett. Industries made an assignment for

20

the benefit of creditors.
Now, on December 29, 1964, after thiscontract had

21

22

been entered into the Tigrett Industries assigned the patent

23

involved to a subsidiary of the Petitioner, known as Jackson

24

Furniture Company.

25

tion.

The company is not a party to this litiga­

And that assignment provided that the Jackson Furniture

Company,, the purchaser,

agrees to abide by all the obligations,

2

terms and conditions of the seller herein, Tigvett Industries,

3

Inc., as more specifically set forth in an agreement dated
r
j

4

July IS, 1961, which was the original assignment that 1 had

5

previously mentioned.

6

Thereafter, on December 22nd

I'm sorry.

There­

7

after on April 26, 1965 Tigrstf Industries did make an assign­

8

ment for the benefit of creditors... An A it was the position of i

0

Standard Industries at thatpoint that the agreement became

10
11

absolutely void by reason of that fart.
Standard Industries then failed to pay royalties in

12

connection with the patent involved, and a suit was brought and.

13

there were various claims that we're made by Tigrett Industries

14

before the trial court.

25

We don’t have to do into those details

They sought reformation of the contract? sought royalties on
©very item that Jackson Furniture Corporation had made.
But,., when the trial court got through, the trial
court held that there were two items that were subject to
royalties s one known as the ',play~a= Round” ? .the other known as
the "Golden Converter.”
Insofar as the play-a-rqund is concernedy Standard
Industries does not contest the validity of that patent, nor
the coverage with respect to the patent applicable to the
play-a-round.
However, Standard industries does contest any coverage

4

?

with respect to the patent involving the Golden Converter,

2

And that is the issue which I am going to address myself to for

3

a few moments.
It was conceded by the trial court and by the

4
S

Appellate Court that the patent involved, which is Patent No,

&

3,162, 865, did not have any claim that specifically covers

7

the structure.

8

claim in the case, required fchatfchere had to be a pair of.space

9

openings in the baseplate of the plate and that drawstrings had

Because the claim of the patent, the broadest

10

to pass through these space openings.

The trial court, how­

11

ever, held that regarless of the fast that the terms of the

12

claim did not cover the structure, nevertheless, by reason of

13

an application, and I believe a misapplication, of the doctrine

14

of equivalence as the lav; presently stands at the present time,

15

that this patent still read; "On the Golden Convertible

10

Structure."

IT

Now, I am not going to discuss in my argument, in

18

detail, whether or not the Court should announce a new doc­

19

trine with respect to the doctrine of equivalents,

20

Q

Well, what is your position?

21

A

X support the position of the Attorney General,

22

Mr. Justice Stewart,
Q

23
24
25

Well, the ATfcorney General is not a party to

this case?

A

No,but he filed an amicus brief.

A

I adopt the position taken by the Attorney

General in the- amicus brief, Mr. Justice Stewart, and I also

abrogated, because this doctrine is actually causing a break

upon technology in the United States.

8

normally when a competitor wishes to go into a field where a

9

company has a dominating patent position, he will come to his

The reason is this?

10

patent counsel and he will says "These are the dominating

11

patents in the field.

How can 1 avoid these patents'?"

12

And what the patent attorney normally does, he

13

studies the claims of the patents involved and attempts,

14

through the engineers of the company Involved, and technical

15

personnel, &tempts to create structures which will avoid

16

patented claims.

17

because the man produces a structure which, in many cases, is

18

superior to the patented structure —

I think so, Mr. Justice Stewart, for this

in the patent action —

Yes,, Mr. Justice White.

7

Q

Just a couple years after the decision of this

8

Court on equivalents?

A

Yes., Mr.. Justice White,, and I submit to the

10

Court that what the Court did was to abrogate the doctrine of

11

equivalents for this reason:

14

different.

there are two ways that you can

There is a, what we call "abstract claim©And these things are

Now, that is the method that is

But, in our patent law, in view of the provision of

23

the Patent Act of 1952 which permitted claiming of means plus

claims with no doctrine of equivalents.

Something in

Well, Mr. Justice, in Halliburton versus Walker,

the Supreme Court specifically rejected claims drawn to
mans plus a function.

And, therefore, with that decision ©n

the books, it would be impossible to draw an abstract claim
that would, be held valid by the Court in view of the Halliburton
case.
And the Patent Act of 1952, when they put in the
illustration that claims could be made by means plus a function
they did that in order to permit this kind of abstract claim.
And I submit to the Court that since it now is no longer
necessary to have a doctrine of equivalents in order to properly

I

s

claim a subject matter, that Congress, by implication did say

2

that the doctrine of equivalents no longer had any application.,

And that is the Petitioner's position on that matter»
We don't have — the case here does not have to

bottom itself on that issue»
Q

S

In fact, that issue has never been raised or

7

litigated or even mentioned until an amicus brief in this

8

Court? am I wrong?

That is correcta Mr, Justice Stewart»

The Petitioner does submit that the

10

doctrine of

11

equivalents in this case was misapplied»

12

case of Graham against Deere, which is the latest pronouncement

13

I believe that this Court hasmade on the doctrine of equivalent:.;,

14

has stated that where the subject matter of a patent is narrow,

that the doctrine of equivalents, likewise, must be very

16

narrowly applied»

apply if there is what is called "file wrapper estoppel” in the
case»

That is if a patentee, in order to obtain a patssifc*

puts a limitation in his claims he may not thereafter say that
a structure is infringing which does not utilise this limita­
tion „
Arid I submit that the file history of this case and
the narrowness of the patent involved, clearly indicates that
the doctrine of equivalents in this case has no application»
9

I submit that for this reason: the invention — and I

1

2

will discuss the validity of the patent in a moment — if the

3

patent is valid at all, it involves a very narrow structure of

4

being able to pull two drawstrings 'through a hole in a base­

5

plate from the top, rather than being able to do the same thing

6

from the bottom»

7

because there is a patent, a prior patent, which is

8

Adamson, which shows the identical structure, except that the

9

drawstrings are tightened from the bottom of the baseplate

10

instead of being tightened from the top of the base plate.

11

Mow, with that simple little improvement, which,

12
13
14

15
16
17

frankly has less of a novelty than the improvement in the
Supermarket Equipment case, because drawstrings are drawstrings .
and drawstrings all pull the netting tight, and putting holes
in the base plate to pull drawstrings through, is something
that8s always been done before:

20
21

22
23
24
25

Two plus two have been added

together and they produce four.
Secondly, in the original case, 'the patentee

18

19

That9s the whole point of novelty in the case ,

attempted to get one claim which was extremely broad, and a
second claim which involved two space openings in the base plate.
Mow, we5re only using one, but this original claim called foxtwo.

I believe it was Original Claim 4.

That claim was re­

jected by the patent office on references and the patentee
then amended the claim to say: "Two spaced openings in the
bass plate with drawstrings passing through these openings and

10

1

2

being connected at the top

of the base plate for manipulation. 5

Therefore, the patentes specifically obtained his

3

claim by means of two spaced openings.

4

from the patent office two spaced openings and under those

5

circumstances, the doctrine of equivalents has no application

in view of the clear file wrapper estoppel in the case.

He always requested

We now come to the question of Lear against Adkins.

8

Lear against Adkins was decided by this Court approximately

9

60 days after the decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of

10
If

Appeals, affirming this case.
Now„ at the time that this case was tried, while the

12

validity of the patent was, in effect, involved, in view of the

13

fact that there was a general denial of royalty liability on

14

the part of the Petitioner, the Petitioner could not at that

15

time contest the validity of the patent because the law in the

16

Sixth Circuit at that time, as set forth in the Petitioner5s

17

brief, was to the effect that a patentee -- that a licensee

18

could not contest the validity of a patent under whichhe was

19

licensed, but could only introduce prior art in order to attemp­

20

to limit the scope of the claims.

21

22
23

Under these circumstances, obviously, since that was
the law in the Sixth Circuit, there was nothing that Petitioner
could do to contest the validity —
/

24
23

Did this come out at the pretrial proceedings?

A

No, Mr. Justice White, because —

Perhaps 1 can find it.

He reaffirmed, did he not, that it would have

dona you no good to raise the validity point?
A

7

Yes.

He said, since both parties concede that

8

the Petitioner, licensee, could not contest the validity of

9

the patent under which he was licensed, therefore, why am I

attempting to introduce evidence with respect to certain prior

11

art?

show, in order to indicate the scope of the claims, which we

13

were permitted to do at that time.

14

What 1 couldn't do is put in anticipating prior art,
because that would have done ms no good.
Q

Where do you find that ruling or holding or

colloquy by the District Judge?
A

Let me see if I can find it in the appendix.

19

If the Court will indulge me for a moment.

20

129-A-3 of the appendix and it reads as follows:

21

22
23

25

It appears on page

"So the Court will know where we are going, we under­
stand that the defendant concedes they cannot attack the
validity of the patents.

That being true, what would be the

relevance of a prior patent that perhaps anticipated the patent
in suit here?"
12

And my reaction to that was; scope of claims, Your

Honor.

And Mr. Kalish, my learned brother, said; "We have no

MR, JUSTICE BLACK:

11

(Laughter)
A

X9m sorry? I'm sorry.
MR. JUSTICE BURGER;

18
13

I didn't complain about it.

You take your time.

We'll

understand what your point is without the names.

20

A

Thank you.

21

Q

Now, it's this center paragraph on 129-A-3 that

22
23
24
25

you relied on?
A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

And before the decision in this Court in Lear against
Adkins, that was the law and that was the solid law in the Sixfcl

13

1

Circuit at the time, too.

2

the Sixth Circuit approximately two months before this case was

3

tried, which said exactly thafcs that a licensee could not

4

attack the validity of a patent under which he was licensed.
Q

3

6

There had been a recant decision of

Well, it wasn’t quite that simple? was it?

1 mean,you think the rule is that clear? do you?
A

7

Except where the rule — the rule was clear,

3

with this exceptions there was a provision, but if there was an

9

anti-trust violation in the case at that point a licensee

10

could attack the validity of the patent.

?!

strangely enough, there was something that might be considered

12

an antitrust violation, in view of the fact that there was a

13

provision which might havefoeen construed to constitute a

14

violation of law in that unpatented subject matter was charged

15
18
il

because there was a provision with respect to the payment of
royalties based upon the profits, provided that the paid
royalties were less than the profits.
However, this provision never came into effect.

18
19

20
2?

22
23
24
25

Now, in this ease,

The

provision may have been severable and under those circumstances
we didn’t rely on it,

And therefore, we could not attack the

validity,
f)

Well, the point was: the patent estoppel question

was specifically flushed in -this litigation? wasn’t it?

And for

reasons be. fc known to yourself'* despite the -uncertain scope of
that doctrine before Lear and despite what you just said: you

14
<

1

chose not to press the arguissent.

2

A

No, Mr. Justice.

Ho.

The point actually, we

3

could not have pressed it because the scope of the doctrine was

4

that unless there was a clear anti-trust violation we could not

5

press the scope of patent validity because of licensee estoppel

6

and the Sixth Circuit case that is cited in my brief, actually

7

sets this thing forth very, very clearly.

8

case was almost on all fours with ours and the court specifi­

9

cally said that: "You cannot contest the validity of the

10

The Sixth Circuit

patent? that is the law."
Q

11

That was the lav? at the time of Lear, too, and

12

they contested it in that case and prevailed when they got up

13

here.
A

14

Well, the Petitioner did not — the situation, is

IS

as set forth in the record and the Petitioner is bound by his

18

record.
Basically, that concludes ray argument and I would likp

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The United States believes that this case does

15

1

present the Court with an appropriate opportunity to correct

2

a harmful, basic incongruity in decisions under the Patent Law»

3

The doctrine of equivalents which was applied by

4

the courts below, is not a statutory doctrine? it has never

5

been provided for by Congress in the 1952 Act or in any of the

6

previous patent legislation and indeed, Congress did not, in

any of its revisions, specifically address itself to the

8

question of the continuing validity of this judicially-created

doctrine,

15

record of the Patent Office, further technological innovation

16

is encouraged during the life of the patent by full di closure

17

of the invention to the public,,including the patentee's

18

competitors and of principal importance here, the public is

19

notified by the patentee's claims of the boundaries of the

20

monopoly so that the patentee's competitors may distinguish

21

between impermissible infringement and permissible competition

22

which, of course, benefits the public.

23

Through the public

As this Court put it in General Electric Company

24

against Wabash Applieance, 304 U.S. "The inventor must inform

25

the public during the life' of the patent that the limits of the
18

1

monopoly asserted, so that it may be known which features may

2

be safely used and manufactured without a license, ana which

3

may not."
And it is in this context that this Court has

4
5

repeatedly said that the claim is the measure of the grant..

6

And in Universal Oil Products against Globe Oil Company in-

7

322 U.S. the Court explained that: '’The claim is required to be

8

specific for the very purpose of protecting the public against

9

extension of the scope of the monopoly.
In keeping with these basic tenets of the patent

10
11

system, there is statutoryprevision for administrative reissue

12

of patents in cases inwhich a patentee, through honest error,

13

claimed more or less than he had a right to claim in his.

14

patent.

IS

The standards governing patent reissue are set forth

15

in Section 251 of the Code, which includes an express provision

17

that no reissue enlarging the scope of the claims of the

18

original patent shall be granted, unless applied for within two

19

years of the grant of the original patent.

20

Moreoever, insofar as the reissued patent alters the

21

claims of the original, protection for the intervening rights

22

of competitors is provided by Section 252 of the Code, a

23

provision which obviously is based on a Congressional premise

24

that claims determine rights.

25

Accordingly, the question, as we see it, and put

19

!

1

somewhat dramatically» is to what avail are these elaborate

2

statutory provisions for administrative examination and weeding

3

out of patent applications» including particular attention to

4

the applicant’s claims because of their statutory role as a

5

definitive measure of the grant» if the stuff of the enforce-"

6

able patent monopoly, which is the economically significant

7

thing is to remain subject to rather unpredictable judicial

8

expansion through application of an amorphous doctrine of

9

equivalents as a standard of infringement,,

10

That doctrine» as most..recently elaborated by this

11

Court in the Graver Tank decision in 339 U.S.f opens up a

12

range of inquiry as to infringement which goes far beyond the

13

terms of the claims»

14

their case and by the Court’s opinion which says» among other

15

things» that "equivalency must foe determined against the con­

16
17

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

This is indicated both by the holding in

text of the patent» the prior art. and the particular circum­
stances of the case»."

An important factor is whether persons

reasonably skilled in the art would have known of the interehangability of an ingredient not contained in the patent with
one that was.
Q

Does that mean that the patent covers anything»

not only what is stated in the claim» but anything that a
parson reasonably skilled in the art would think is a substitute
for the patent?
In short» anything that is unpatentable in view of the
20

past art and this patent? anything that is unpatentable is
2

covered by the doctrine of equivalents?

seemed to us to be the matter of general public importance in

5

the case.

8

It

With the Court’s permission, I owuld like to summar­

7

ize briefly die historic setting which gave rise to that

8

doctrine, since the description of it in our brief is somewhat

9

oversimplified9 and I commend to the Court’s attention a com­

10

prehensive study of this history not cited in the brief,

11

entitleds "Evolution of the Claims at 0. S. Patents," by

12

Carl B. Luts, published in three parts in Volume 20 of the

13

"Journal of the Patent Office Society,'* in 1938.

14

While the doctrine of equivalents was first articula­

15

ted by this Court in 1864 in Winans against Denmead, it

16

amounted to an elaboration of the general approach that judges

17

had been taking to the question of patent infringement, from

m

the earliest period.

19

"There was, as the brief for the Patent Law Associa­

2©

tion notes, no statutory requirement of claims in patent

21

applications prior to the Patent Act of 1836, although the

22

earlier statutes did require the patentee in a general way to

23

distinguish his invention from all other things before known

24

and as a result of judicial interpretations of this general

25

requirement, claims began to be included in many patent
24

1

applications,

tod the 1836 Act, under which Winans was de­

2

cided, codified this practice in its provision quoted in the

While claims were thereafter used in patent applica­

Often what was claimed was

10

even though that, of course, is not what is patentable and the

claims tended to be drafted with references back to the speci­

fications of critical parts where specific definitive state­

13

ments of what is claimed would be required today.
to example can be found in this Court’s decision in

14

15
IS
17
18
19

Burr against Duryee, as cited in our brief, Volume I of
Wallace,

tod other examples are cited by Mr. Luts.
As the Patent Office and the Courts gradually began

to apply more exacting requirements of claiming, the trend is
reflected in the greater emphasis on distinctness and parti­

20

cularity in claiming, included in the 1870 revision of the

21

Patent Law and carried forward ever since.

22
23
24
25

The important thing, as we see it, is that during
this early period when patent applications seldom included
definitive claims, to the extent that the courts enforced the
statutory requirement that the applicant distinguish the new

25

1

from the old, or the claiming requirement of the 1836 Act, that

2

enforcement was confined torulings on patent validity.

3

The question of infringement was almost'universally

4

regarded as a question of fact to be decided by comparing the

5

machines of the plaintiff and the defendant.

6

The equivalents doctrina, then, was merely an

7

elaboration of this general approach.

3

during this period was, in effect, treated as a technicality,

3

going only to the question of patent validity.

The claiming requirement

The claims

10

really couldn't serve to notify would-be competitors of the

!1

scope of the monopoly, but merely indicated to them whgthsg a

n

valid patent existed.
Of course, a different view was sometimes expressed,

13
14

as it was by the dissenting justices in Winans against

15

DEranead, but it was not until 1877 in Mr. Justice Bradley’s

16

opinion for the unanimous court in Keystone Bridge, 95 U.S.,

17

that it was held fchatthe claiming requirement is not a mere

18

technicality and indeed, the patentees are bound by their

19

claims as the definition of their judicially enforceable

20

monopolise«

21

The Court’s opinion there relied under the reissue

22

provisions ©f the patent law, as well as on the claiming re­

23

quirements and pointed out that it is in the patent office

24

that the patentee’s"claim is or is supposed to be examined,

25

scrutinsed, limited and made to conform to what he is entitled
26
j

1
2

to."
There followed the many decisions discussed in our

3

brief in which this Court has held that the claim is the

4

measure of the grant to be relied on as such by the patentee's

S

competitors and yet the equivalents doctrine which denies this

6

and was Milt out of contrary premises, has also been carried

7

forward by a,kind of inertia, which can preserve inconsisten­

8

cies in th© .laws as a matter of stare decisis (?)

9

There has been accommodation to the extent that the

10

equivalents doctrine has been limited by the doctrine of file

II

wrapper ©stoppal, which prevents the patentee from asserting

iz

dominion.over the area he renounced before the Patent Office,

13

by amending his claims to induce issuance of a patent.

14

Our view is that this doctrine should b® regarded,

IS

not merely as a nfarpow principle of estoppai, but .as one

!6

manifestation of the basic tenet of the Keystone Bridge

17

opinion arid of the patent system that the only patent monopolies

18

that are judically enforceable, are those defined by claims

19

that have been approved by the Patent Office,

20

Our proposal, therefore, is that the equivalents

21

doctrine with its wide range of inquiry and unpredictability

22

of result should now be rejected in favor of the standard of

23

infringement which focuses on the claims in the light of their

24

statutory function.

25

One possibility, of course, would be a standard that

27

1

would limit infringement to articles that comeliterally within

2

the terms of the claim,,

3

Circuit once took that position by holding that under the

4

logic of the patent system the doctrine of equivalents can

mean no more than that the language ofthe claim shall'be

But it abandoned the position because

We believe thatthe policies and logic of the patent

11

system do not require a test s© rigidly verbalistic which would

12

insulate the copying of inventions with only the most trivial

13

or tolerable deviation from fcheliteral terns of the claims.

'

We think the Court was correct in saying in the

14

15

Graver Tank opinion that such, an approach would unduly exalt

16

form over substance, even though we regard the holding and

17

rationale of that decision an unfortunate overreaction to this

18

problem.
What we urge is a test based on the substance of the

claim? a test based on the substance of what thepatent office

passed on and approved as the definition of the legally-

22

warranted scope of the monopoly.

a basically similar approach was proposed in an article pub­

After noting that the entire logic of the development

6

of the patent system has been to limit the patent owner more and

7

more to the terms of the claims, Mr. Woodward»wrote that:

9

this development only "if one treats the so-called doctrine

10

of equivalents" merely as a form of relief against the almost

11

inevitable inadvertences involved in the formulation of patent

P-

claims,"and still quoting:"the relief must be applied only in

the cases clear enough to establish strong equities in favor

14

of the plaintiff, and little or none in favor of the defendant.

This expresses the general thrust of the test we have

proposed in terras of whether a revised claim which would

Petitioner threads the

The claim could have been drafted so as to cover
both situations, either in the form of a means claim, such as
"said base plate having an

aperture means through which the

drawstrings are threaded,"

This is directly in consultation

with the Patent Office, I might add.

the Court has got two pictures right against that page number.

playpen from the front, then there are two details of the leg

16

mechanisms which are figures 2 and 3 which are not particularly

17

significant, and then figure 4 which shows the bottom of the

then figure 5 which shows the playpen in the upper positi©h

the patented invention.

A

Howg as to a nonfunctional aspect such as if

the claim had specified the color in the base plate, for
31

1

example, in a context is. which this is obviously nonfunctional.

2

It would be unreasonable for .anyone to assume that the grant

3

from the Patent Office is so arbitrarily limited in the scope

4

of the monopoly approved.
Here, however, we believe this kind of functional in-

S
6

difference does invoke the principle of the Keystone Bridge

7

case.

The patentees are bound by the terms of their claim.

8

'So, onr submission is that the amorphous nature of

9

the equivalents doctrine, along with what Judge Learned Hand

10

referred to in Claude Neon Lights, as the vacillation in this

Court's decisions attributable to an inconsistency in theory

12

have resulted in regrettable uncertainty as to the permissible

scope of competitive enterprise.
This Court has recognized in cases discussed in our
brief that an unwarranted zone of uncertainty as to the scope
of patent monopolies can harmfully deprive the public of the
benefits of legitimate competition.

People will steer clear of

the zone of uncertainty, a familiar principle in decisions of
this Court in many areas.
We ask the Court to address itself to the incon­
sistency in precedent which is at the root of the present un­
certainty in this area and to bring coherence to this aspect of
the competitive economy by implementing Congressional patent
policy in the manner we have proposed.

pay two pereant to the seller, Tigrett Industries, the company,

patent which there is now a concession that no issue of \alidit3'

However, when that patent was before the District
Court, as the record shows, the defendants were not reluctant
to attempt to attack that patent on the

ground that it set

forth structure by an expired patent.
The reference made to page 129--A-3 is also colloquy
relating to the Play“a-Round patent, and not the Golden Convertible patent, which shews that the defendant also knew that

Going on to the other — to their part, Your Honor,

3

we feel that, the Lear versus Adkins decision is not applicable

Going on to the next point, but briefly, relates to

this problem of contract cancellation.

We had never felt that

10

this was earnestly urged by defendants.

The sale was effected

22

23

The title was completely

the parties until one year after institution of suit and con­

5

sequently , we think it*s an understatement to call it an after­

6

thought» to call it a mere rationalisation for not paying what

7

they agreed to pay.
Their argument is that as of the time of the assign­

and they had lost the patent.

11

lying agreement whereby John Burton Tigrett had assigned the

12

patent to Tigrett Industries originally, called for the fact

13

that in the event in that agreement the purchaser — not

14

Tigrett Industries by name, but the purchaser — if they made

15

an assignment for benefit of creditors that license in the

16

on® hand v

.17

the assignment in the other, would be automati­

cally cancelled.
It is the position of the defendants that since

19

Their view is that the under­

Tigrett

Industries made this assignment, for the benefit- of

20

creditors four months after they got — after the Petitioner

21

got title, that petitioner lost its rights? lost its title.

22

24
25

The assignment at page 76-A of the appendix, as my
brother Bader read to the Court, states that "Jackson Furniture
Company, agrees to abide by all the obligations, terms and
conditions of the seller as set forth in the agreement dated

43

1

July 19, 1961 between John Burton Tigrett of Jackson* Tennessee*

2

and Tigrett Industries„
How* we contend that this so-called assignment for

3
4

the benefit of creditors in that agreement was a condition

5

which Petitioner accepted and Petitioner then stood in the

8

shoes of its assignor and that clause only then related to

7

1 would like to direct our attention to the matter
of the doctrine of equivalents.

The District Court and fee

Court of Appeals both held that the infused structure was the
equivalent of that claim.

At page 123 to 125-A of the appendix

Yes, sir.

The patent was sold to Standard and part of the,

2

A

Yes, sir.

3

Q

What about the three percent?

4

life of the patent to John Burton Tigrett, who was the original

6

owner who assigned to Tigretfc Industries and they were paying

7

him three percent.

8
9
10

Q

But your point is: this was just a measure of

the purchase price of the patent?
A

As far as the Respondent Tigrett Industries

11

is concerned, the two percent to them was part of their pur­

12

chase price.

13

was simply that the Petitioner was going to adopt and accept

14

the obligation which the seller had to him.

two percent was override to them.

But the whole business is all part of the pur­

chase price of the patent that they bought; is that it?

Yes, sir.

Getting back to the Government’s position on the

Counsel

9

for the Government has related to that clause andin this case

10

here has suggested, I understand with advice of the Patent

11

Office,

that we could have used the expression "aperture

12

means»"

This is a novel concept in itself, because as far as

13

we're concerned, the hole is nothing and a means is a something

14

And the particular statute relates that you can use the means

15

for performing a function and we have known the hole or opening

16

to perform a function.
So, it's very easy on after-the-fact cases to say

17
18

that we could have done this or done that.

But we maintain

19

that when you using openings, apertures, the like, you do not

20

have die means or an element? you have a non-element.
So, consequently and secondly, the use of the word

ORAL ARGUMENT BY SIDNEY NEUMAN, ESQ. FOR

AMERICAN PATENT LAW ASSOCIATION AS AMICUS CURIAE

12

MR. NEUMAN;

Mr.Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;

us to brief the questions which are raised by this assault

16

which the Government has made upon the equivalency rule, which

is now, at least 120 years old.

18

I first wish to express the appreciationof the American

join Mr. Kalish in saying that much of the position,

19

in fact, a great deal of the position of the Government is a

20

scarecrow type argument.

21

22

the equivalency rule means and what the courts are doing as a

23

result of Graver.

The Government has generalised? the

There are three or four points which I would like to
make at the outset, which to my way of thinking, demonstrates

the — some of the basic fallacies of the Government's position,

In the brief filed by the Government there seems to be a sugges­

3

tion that the patent clause of the constitution has something

4

to do with this matter of equivalency» that the constitution re­

There is nothing in the constitu­

Secondly, the Government has not been a very good

7

historian as far as the genesis of the doctrine is concerned.

9

The Government asserts that the winans case was decided under

10

a different statutory scheme which did not require specificity

in claiming.

12

1790 act.

13

in the two or three periods that that act was in effect.

14

This is not so.

The original Patent Act was the

Then we have the Patent Act of 1793 which was—

18

period what,we called a "registration system/' not an examina­

19

tion system.

20

Wow, between 1753 and 1836 we did not have in the

The

The examination system came into being in 1836 and

21

the Act of 1836 contained language very much like the language

22

which vie now find in Section 112 about specificity in claims,

23

fjid fcais is the reason that the problem or the debate came in

24

the Winans case.

2S

It was because of the fact that the 1836

statute required that the patentee particularly specify and
61

1

point out what it was that he was claiming as his invention,

2

that you had the. division in the Court at that time.

4

Douglas felt in the Graver case, that there should be a strict

5

construction of the words of the statute and & strict construe-

8

tion of the terms employed in the claim and then you had the

1

majority of the Court in the Winans case which felt that

8

there should be some room for construction, some liberality of

9

construction and thatthe claim should receive a reasonable

You had

10

interpretation and this was what the debate was about in the

11

Winans case.

12

or do we have a little broader construction, a little breadth

13

as far as the terns of the claims are concerned?

Do we have strict construction in patent claims

The other point which I would like to mention is the

T4
IS

assertion that the courts at the present time do not focus on

16

the claim.

17

know that we do focus on the claims and that the courts do

18

focus on the claims.

19

Now, wa that are in the patent litigation practice,

Another fallacy in the Government’s position is the

20

asaurapfcion which is made here that after the Court has found

21

that, a patent is valid or a claim that a patent is valid, it

22

doss not return to the claim in connection with the determinatic >n

23

of the infringement issue.

24

ignore the claims after they have found them invalid and in™

25

stead, when they do take up an equivalency determination, they

This is not so.

62

The courts do not

1

go back and they reconsider whether or not that claim is valid

2

in the light of the prior art in view of the scope and the

3

construction which the court is placing upon the claim.

4

Your Honors are familiar, I am sure, with the

5

classical statement that was made in this Court many, many

6

years ago that, which is to this effect: "that which.infringes

?

if later, anticipates, if earlier."

2
3

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

12s30 P.M.

Mr. Neuman, you may con­

tinue .

4

MR. NEUMAN;

If it please the Court:

When we

S

recessed, I was making the point about the rule of law which

6

the courts, I believe, never lose sight of, namely that'that

7

which infringes,if later, anticipates, if earlier,,

I would like

8

fcocome back to it but I have decided that 1 would try and

9

answer Mr. Justice White's question that he put to Mr. Kalish

1©

about the disallowance of a subsequently filed application

11

upon an existing patent, where the Patent Office refuses to

12

grant the second patent on- the ground that it is obvious in

13

view of an

n

earlier patent.

Now, what we have to keep in mind is that sometimes

15

an element may be both an equivalent and obvious? sometimes it

18

may be obvious but not an equivalent? sometimes it may be an

17

equivalent but not obvious.

18

this„ that in the examination of an application the patent

19

office is looking at the disclosures of the earlier patent and

2©

the question ofobviousness is determined on the basis of

21

whether or not the new alleged claim subject matter is obvious

22

or not obvious in the light of the disclosures of the prior

23

art.

24
25

The point, Mr. Justice White, is

The Examiner does not get into the qiiQgtisrA. of the
claims of the references that hess relying upon, and equivalency

64

So, you*re saying that there can be some non-

patentable, obvious elements which are not equivalents?
A

7

Which are not.

And it's entirely possible, sir,

8

that something which has been held to be obvious in view of an

9

earlier patent, could well be held to be an equivalent in a

10

properly-litigated situation.

merits of the, of this action which is before Your Honors.

have only prepared on this subject of equivalency; 1 was not in
the case with Mr. Bader and Mr. KaXish and I'm afraid 1 can’t
answer that question.

is a claim which relates to the structure of the playpen and
this is the*question of infringement which was before the lower
courts, whether the accused playpen was an infringement of the
claim of the respondent.

The lower courts held that under the

doctrine of equivalency that -- well, first, I understand this.
65

1

that there .was one structure which literally responded to the

2

claim and then there was a second structure which did not

3

literally respond but which the courts below held was an in­

4

fringement under the doctrine of equivalency»
Now, on this matter of whether or not the courts

As I said, '-hey first determine whether the claim is

10

have decided thatthe accused structure is the equivalent and

11

is reached by the claim, under the doctrine, then the court

12

goes back and takes another look at the prior art to see whether

13
14

or not the claimf.thus- construed* is valid in the light of the
prior art.
Now, this is exactly whathappened in the Sanitary

IS

16
17
18

Refrigerator case.

Thera you had exactly the same patent, the

same accused structure? the records in the two cases were sub­
stantially the same s the record of the Seventh Circuit and the

19

record in the Third Circuit.

The Seventh Circuit found that the

20

accused structure was an infringement on the doctrine of

21

equivalents; the Third Circuit found that if was not, and one
i

22
23
24
25

of the interesting things about the opinion of the Third
Circuit Court of Appeals is that that Court expressly pointed
out that they were to give the claim the breadth that the plain­
tiff was asking for and it would be invalid in view of the

66

1

prior art
This

2

is why, in the Third Circuit no equivalency was

3

found.

Then the two cases came up here and this Court agreed

4

with the Seventh Circuit and found that the accused structure

5

was an equivalent.

6

the courts always have for the validity of the patent.

7

I would call attention to Smith versus Snow.

Again, is showing the great concern which

This

S

Court found a patent valid; found an entirely incubator to be

9

an infringement of the Smith patent; gave it a construction

10

which mad©' other prior art pertinent which had not been in that

11

case, and in a subsequent cases Smith versus Hall 301 U.S. this

12

Court found the Smith patent invalid in view of the public use

13

which had not been in the first case.
The point I'm making is that once you have given a

14

IS

construction to a claim then other prior arts, other references

16

become material to the broader scope which is being given to

17

a claim.

18

Now, the .Government also says that the doctrine has

19

not been proparly limited.

We submit that it has.

Within the

20

time that has been available for research since I learned that

21

I would take part in this argument, I have had two of my office

22

associates check the citations of the Graver case over a period

23

of about 20 years.

24

this is something that the Court would be interested in

25

examined about 220 citations of the Graver case.

They examined about 200 and — I believe

67

We found

they

1

this, and these are very rough figures, that roughly 128 cases

2

of infringement were found where the doctrine was invoked and

3

91 cases were found where the doctrine was refused»

4

Now, this is approximately 56 percent to 34 percent.

5

I submit that this shows that the court have not gone overboard

6

in applying the doctrine of equivalency, and this is partic­

7

ularly true in view of the fact that a recent report by Senator

8

Spong, head of the Subcommittee on Patents in the Senate,,

9

indicates that only about 28 percent of the patents being

10

litigated are being upheld? so you0ve got 56 percent of 28

11

percent and ii9s a very small number of patents indeed, that

12

are getting the benefit of the doctrine of equivalents.

13

The three major points fchatwe make are these;

14

There is no factual basis for the Government’s

15
16

extraordinary request.
Second, we submit that there are no cogent reasons

17

for rejecting as a matter of law, this rule of patent eons true- '■*

18

felon which has been so long applied by the courts.

19

And third, that the Government’s proposed alternative

20

test is an impractical one and is incomprehensible unless it

21

means what we thinkit means, and in that event the Government’s

22

proposed test is the very same rule of equivalency which is now

23

being applied by the courts.

24
25

As to that first point; we submit that the assertion
Which has been made about, the effects of the equivalency rule

1

ar® highly exaggerated and more fantasy and imaginary than

2

3

supports these assertions? first that creative enterprise and

courts have been allying to patents for a period of 120 years
and this Court, time and time again, has recognised that a
patentee’s claims are to receive a liberal and a reasonable

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY I. WALTON BADER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
72

1

MR. BADER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

2

Court: It has been called to my attention that there apparently

3

is a feeling or may he a feeling that the nonapplicability of

4

the doctrine of equivalents in this case was not raised below.

5

It was raised below and raised very vigorously below.
It was the contention of the Petitioner that first

6
7

the structure involved, did. not fall within the terms of the

8

claims»

B

Secondly, the doctrine of equivalents has no applica­

10

bility to this

11

number of other defenses.

12

case, because of file wrapper estoppel and a

In the appendix, page 44-A the trial court, in

S3

deciding- against the Petitioner’s contention had this to say:

14

"We are satisfied fro»:* the proofs, however, as plaintiffs

15

contend that the doctrine of equivalents is applicable here

16

because the two structures work in substantially the same way

17

and with the same result."

18

and the Great Lakes case.

19

And then they cite the Graver case

In the Court of Appeals’ decision, where the question

20

was raised again and where; the Petitioner urged that the

21

doctrine of equivalents again had no application, the Court of

22

Appeals said, "the fact that the playpen floor V7&s adjusted up

23

or down by strings running through the floor through one hole,

24

rather than two holes, did not appear to him," referring to

25

the trial judge, "to represent a substantial difference.8'
73

1

Neither does it to us.

And again citing the Graver cases so

2

there was no question that the nonapp 1icabiXity of the doctrisse

3

of equivalents was raised in this case and raised vigorously

4

throughout the proceedings.

5

Q

What was the last page from which you -~

6

A

That is the appendix# page 53-A-ll.

It is the

7

second paragraph from the bottom# the second large paragraph,

8

where tha Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit refers to the

9

Graver case# as well.
Insofar as the question of the validity of the patent

10
11

is concerned# the Court in its questions to me this morning#

12

pointed out that we did not feel that we could raise the

13

validity of the patent in view of the prior law of the Sixth

14

Circuit.

15

were due# and I

16

Court# where the validity does become an issue# because the

17

validity of this patent is in issue.

18

However# we denied in our answer that any royalties
think

that

whenever

a

patent comes before the

If the patent here is invalid there are no royalties

19

payable# based on Lear against Adkins. Then I submit to the

20

Court that the invalidity of the patent was raised# even though

21

we did not have a full-dress trial on invalidity as we normally

22

would do# becauseof the prior law involved.

23

Now# my learned brother# Mr. kalish# made one rather

24

inadvertent error in that he said that the paragraph of the

25

agreement was paragraph 16-E ~ yes# Mr. Kalish said 16-C# but

74
I

1

paragraph actually is 16-E if it please the Court»

At that time it is

specified as an application number.

Q

What page is it?

A

It is on the appendix, page 62-A and paragraph.

16-E refers

It is not a material

S

E says: “On patent application Number 124668 dated July 16,

1961, which is actually the patent involved herein.

And

10

paragraph C covers 2790978, and that’s the one that we are

11

not contesting the validity of in this ease.

IE

actually the E paragraph that wecre concerned about,

13

Q

Is it identical language?

14

A

Yes; it is identical language.

So that it is

The error is

15

not a material errors but I just thought I would bring it to the

16

Court's attention.

I am sura it was inadvertent.

17

Q

Paragraph 3-A?

18

A

It is paragraph number 16-E, Mr. Justice.

19

Q

I mean what page?

20

A

Page S2-A of the appendix.

2?

Now, the other situation I would like to point out

22

is: my learned adversary states that this is actually an assign-'

23

xaent and not a contract, but. if we look at the complaint, we

24

see that the complaint doesn’t sue us on the assignment; it

25

sues us on the contract.

Paragraph 3 saying: "Tigrett

75

1

Industries entered into a contract with Standard Industries,

2

The aforesaid contract" — et cetera, et cetera»

3

Q

What difference does that make to us now?

4

A

It really doesn’t, except —

5

0

If it isn't a license

8

A

It is a license but not an assignment, Mr,

7

Justice Burger.

8

Q

It’s a contract of sale? the sal® of —

9

Q

The sale of merchandise.

10

A

Yes,

And in that contract the license provision

11

is part of the contract, so it really makes very little dif­

12

ference where the license provision is put in.

13

the provision involved says: "The following will be — the

14

following arrangement shall apply with respect to the Infant

15

Division Patent Licenses;" and therefore the mere fact that

16

this license agreement is incorporated in

the contract for

the sale of assets, makes no difference.

It’s still a patent

17

18

license agreement that we*re dealing with.

19

Q

20

terest in the patent?

21

22
23
24
25

The license —

A

Did the patentholder retain some residual in­

The patentowner owned the patent until sub­

sequently he conditionally assigned it to our subsidiary, the
Jackson Furniture Corporation, who, interestingly enough, Mr»
Justice, is not a party to this litigation.

Now,'if,-in fact,

he wanted to sue on the assignment document involved it' would
76

?

would have been necessary for the respondent her© to have sued

2

our subsidiary, Jackson Furniture Corporatiori, but he chose

3

not to.? he chose to sue us on the contract»

4

And under those circumstances, the fact that an

3

assignment was made subsequently to our subsidiary would make

6

no difference.

7

Furthermore, of course, if, in fact, the assignment

8

involved was made to our subsidiary, it was still made subject

9

to the conditions and therefore, the condition involved, having

10

not been fulfilled by reason of the assignment made for the

11

benefit of creditors, the entire assignment becomes void any­

12

way, and there is a failure of title involved,,

13

One other point that I would like to say —

14

Q

Could I ask you —

A

Yes, sir.

inventor and the Respondent here, was that a license?
A

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

There is no question about that

A

No question, Youx* Honor.

Q

And all that the licensee, than, assigned, you

say toStandard, the Petitioner, was its license interest?
A

No? it never assigned anything to Standard.

Q

Well, to whatever —

A

It assigned the patent involved;
77

that was

1

licensed, to Jackson Furniture Corporation, subject to an

2

obligation on Jackson Furniture Corporation t© pay royalties»

3

Q

Well, who owned the patent after the assignment?

4

A

After the assignment the patent originally was

5

owned by Jackson Furniture Corporation, which is not a party

6

to this litigation, and as soon as Tigrett Industries mad® an

7

assignment for the benefit of creditors we submit, that the

8

ownership of the patent then went back —

I'm not concerned about that»

No.

There was an assignment from the inventor

involved in this case?
A

Mo.

There was a license was from Tigrett to

Standard, the plaintiff in this case.

I see my time is up —

Q

Well, you can answer it.

A

The license agreement was made between Tigrett

Industries and Standard Industries with respect to a patent.
The patent involved was owned by a man by the name of John
Burton Tigrett.

Mr. John Burton Tigrett assigned the patent to

Tigrett Industries, our licensor, but with a condition in the
78
i

1

assignment 'that the assignment would become void if Tigrefct

2

Industries made an ©sslgmasat to creditors.

3

Q

After that did your subsidiary, Jackson -

4

Furniture, get an assignment from Tigrett Industries? is that

it?

6

A

-5 Q

8

Yes. After that
After Tigrett Industries had made a license to

Standard, you’re telling ns; is that correct?

9

A

That’s correct.

10

Q

Then Tigrett Industried assigned the patent

11
12

itself to your subsidiary?
A

That is correcte and thereafter Tigrett Indus­

13
