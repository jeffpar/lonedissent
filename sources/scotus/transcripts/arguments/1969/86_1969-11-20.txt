Number 86..

MR. FARRELL:
Court?

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Richard T. Farrell for the Petitioner, Melvin Morales.
Your Honors, this case comes to this Court via writ o£

certiorari to'the Court of Appeals of the State of New York,
which court held that certain police activities founded upon
less than probable cause, did not constitute a violation of
the Defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment, and do not,
affect the confession yielded by the Defendant after he was
seized, as we contend, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
The facts in this case are fairly simply set forth.

16

Early in the morning of October 4, 1964, in Bronx County, New

17

York, Mrs. Addle Brown died of multiple stab wounds? 31 to be

18

exact, inflicted upon her by at that time an unknown assail­

19
20
21

ant in an elevator of a 21-story apartment house in a public
housing project in the South Bronx.
The police efforts at the scene at that time on Octo­

22

ber 4th, yielded no leads, but on October 5, 1964, Detective

23

Aubrey Ferguson was walking in the vicinity of the scene of

24

the crime and met Mrs. Rebecca Morales who is the mother of the

25

Petitioner here, Melvin Morales.
2

Detective Ferguson knew the Morales family? knew them

1

2

at a different address and he asked Mrs» Morales; "What are

3

you doing here?”

4

to the building in which the crime had been committed.

And she said, "Oh, I live there," pointing

5

The police, also sometime after October* 5th, had in­

6

formation from a young man who testified at the trial that he

7

had been outside the premises where the crime was committed and

8

had seen someone outside the building at the pertinent time.

9

Q

Was that the very young boy?'

13

By the time Savarra Musio who tried this case in the

14

Supreme Court, finished cross-examining this young fellow, he

15

had the crime being committed sometime in, October, November or

16

December of 1964.

But on October 11th the police called again (from the

21

22

testimony of Detective Ferguson, at Page 732 in the record)

23

and said, "we’re rounding up some of the neighborhood narcotics

24

addicts."

appears with these narcotics addicts who were rounded upon the

And the police then concentrated their efforts on

trying to find Melvin Morales to talk to him.

8

her that they were interested in speaking to Melvin.

Mew, if instead, there was this phrase that you

'50

said the detective used to describe due process of getting

11

this information —if, instead of that, a dozen detectives or

12

24 detectives had walked up and down the street talking to

13

every narcotic addict and the others of that world and got the

14

same information, would:you say the case was different or the

15

same?
A

18

Mr. Chief justice, I attached no significance to

17

the fact that the officers rounded up these other narcotics,

18

addicts.

19
20
21

Q

I assume that you did when ycu emphasized that

phrase so much.

A

Well, you will have to excuse the advocate for

perhaps

22

using what X consider/a "loaded- term.”

X do not attach any

23

Bignificance to the fact, that there was a “round-up."

24

Q

Well, you cleared up the questionfor me.

On October .13, approximately

event that led to the homicide investigation and about three

days after the police tad started to concentrate their efforts

About 4:00 in the afternoon Mrs. Morales was visited
by one of the officers; I believe it was Carroll.- who asked
her; "Well,, do you think your son will be around?”
said, "Well, I think he'll be up this afternoon."

And she

The first words out of Morales8 mouth, in words or in

10

substance, wass "Carroll, you know I can't take a beating."

11

Carroll replied to that: "Stop building fences; step making

alibis; stop building crutches; there is one thing you can't

do: you can't lie to God.

Do you believe in God?”

Morales: "Yes, I do."

14

It was 45 minutes from the initial time of taking into custody

The Court of Appeals for the State of New York said
in its opinion that it stay be conceded that there was no
probable causa*

They did not stake a finding on the question of

whether there was probable cause or not.

But, X submit, on

the record in this case, and especially in light of the testi­
mony of the two officers who picked Morales up inthe first
place.

One saying, "Well, 1 had nothing definitely to tie him

to the crime*”

Ibid the other saying, ”1 was dubious about his

connection at • the tine and it wasnf fc until the interrogation

it
brought/out that 1 was convinced that he was guilty.”
There is quite obviously no probable cause»

Further,

the Court of Appeals did, however, sa&m to make a finding? a
finding which I submit, is probably binding on this Court.

The

Court ©f Appeals said on Page 58 of its Opinion in 22 NY 2d.
"The record does not support a finding that Defendant consented
his
to/detention and questioning.” Says the Court of .Appeals, "The
fact that there is no consent; the fact that there was no
probable cause does not necessarily make the seizure here un~

1
reasonable.

We must examine to see whether under all the air\

curastancesAether the seizure here was {reasonable or not.”

an objection to this Court considering that question since the

What bearing do you think the stop and frisk

at ail, Mr. Justice Harlan, except for the very general'propo­
sition that the police may make some temporary estoppage of &
citizen if there is a reason to inquire about his suspicious
conduct.

The only think the police officers saw Morales do

was to get out of a taxicab.

That’s Sir from the kind of con­

duct, I think that is- —
Q

Well, there were some events that led them to ba

there to see him get out of the taxicab; were there not?

A

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, there certainly were.

Q

And these events didn't just happen to be there.

A

Oh, they were there because they were looking foi:

Melvin Morales.

But as to -the reason why they were looking

for Melvin Morales that makes the seizure here unreasonable
within the ambit of the Fourth Amendment.
They were not operating on anything remotely approach™
ing probable cause for his arrest.

They had nothing but a bare

susplction that he might have something to tell them about the
14

«rima.

Since, of course, his fastily lived in the building;

3m was an addict? lie had not been seen ©round.

It hardly

inordinately points th& finger of suspicion of Morales.
The Court of 'Appeals said the checkerbc red square of
investigationpointed only to Morales.

But at most, to give the

people their due, four out of the 64 squares or. a checkerboard
will fill them in.
justification of

That hardly amounts up to the kind of
the seizure and detention of the citizen, at;

in this case,
To say that since Morales knew the police were looking for him that his coating' to his , mother1 s beauty parlor may
be read as a surrender, flies in the face of both the deter­
mination by the Mew York Court of appeals that there was
nothing in this record tosupport the consent argument and it
is also tantamount, in my opinion, to saying that a lamb that
goes out to the pasture surrenders himself to the wolf»

If

Morales wanted to surrender to the police there were better
places to.surrender than your mother's beauty parlar.

There

axe police stations, and many of them.
But Morales, 1 don’t think, can. be said, to have sur­
rendered in this case.
cided that way.

I think the Court of Appeals has de­

There is no surrender? no consent to interro­

gation at that place under these circumstances and since that
is the determination, I believe, on the question of fact by the
highest court in -the State of Mew York, I do not think that
15

1

question, of fact is reviewable by this court.

But if the Court;

2

be convinced that there was a violation of the Fourth Amend­

3

ment it becomes another more pressing problem.
If the Fourth Amendment was violated what effect

4

5

should that have upon the use of Morales5 confessions?

my leave from the American Law Institute's Model Code of Pre­

7

Taking

I believe that the

answer to that question that, once the confessions are taken so

10

close, at least in point of time, to have unreasonable seizure j

11

within the Fourth Amendment, those confessions must bs barred

12
13

from evidence without reference to the fact, of, the .voluntari­
ness or not.

from engaging in the prohibitive conduct; the prohibitive con­
duct here is; an investigatory detention upon less than probable
cause.
The involuntary submission of the citizen to the

i*

pose behind the exclusionary rule is to discourage the police

custody in the police station, if the Fourth Amendment is to
be protected in this context, the confessions that came at the j
police station just like John Davis's fingerprints in the Davis
case-, must be barred from evidence, whether they were voluntary
or not.
The next step, of course, is if the Court not be

willing to buy a rule based upon hearsay exclusion we then

The link between these confessione and 'die seisure
is so close, both in time and in circumstances, I believe#
Your Honors# that it cannot be reasonably said in a realistic
appraisal of this record# that there has been the kind of
attenuation between the unlawful police conduct, in the first
place violating the principles .renounced by this Court several
months agd•in David versus Mississippi# and the confessions
to say that the confessions are not tha tainted produce of this
initial police illegality.
And further# Your Honors# we submit# that the con-r

fessions of the defendant, each and every one of them were not
proved to be voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt.
He did confess he was warned, but he was a narcotics
addict, a. group prone, to be garrulousj to have a rather shallot
perception of their rights and responsibilities.

He was

isolated from his only ally in the field# his mother, who
testified that she wanted to tell him that he shouldn't speak
to the police officers.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:

Assuming there was no surrender

no surrender in this case and if there was a surrender, cer­

23

tainly the Fourth Amendment would not come into play — but

24

the taking into custody, the detention, the seizure, the arrest,

25

of Kelvin Morales in, under the circumstances of this case, was

20

1

reasonable and appropriate within the meaning of the Fourth

2

Amendment «

i
The Fourth Amendment, as opposed to the Fifth and

3
4

Si:cth Amendments, applies a flexible and variable standard -that

5

is not absolute, like the Fifth and the Sixth.

'O

have' been provided by Terry against Ohio.

Guidelines

And X submit that

7

tliepaople have the right to detain someone where, there is a

8

reasonable basis for belief that that individual has informa­

9

tion concerning a crime which has been committed.
Justice Frankfurter stated it much more eloquently

10
11

than 1 in Culomhe•

He. said, "There are things which cannot

12

speak and it is necessary to detain and to interrogate witnes se 3

13

who possibly may be suspects in order to ascertain who has

14

committed a particular crime."

there has to be a balancing between society and the individual.
In this case the Petitione?: who counsel has characterised as a
lamb, was found by a jury of his peers to have delivered 31
stab wounds to a 56-year-old - woman in Bronx County, Mrs. Addle
Brown„
The police, arriving upon the scene, questioned
individuals and before this investigation was over, they
literally questioned over 100 individuals.
did they receive that first night?

What information

They knew that the indivi­

dual or possibly the individual who committed this crime,

21

1

lived in that building, because one of the tenants, after the

2

elevator arrived upon his floor, heard footsteps below this

3

particular floor and. heard a door.
They questioned individuals in the building.

4

They

5

questioned Mrs. Morales.

They questioned her son, Snooky.

6

And the evidence indicates in the record and that is all we

7

have to go on — is that two individuals were interrogated by

8

the police at the stationhouse.

Snooky Morales and a man by

They had no probable cause to arrest, in

10

the technical sense of the term, either Snooky or Shorty.

But

11

I respectfully submit, conducting this investigation, based

12

on the information which they had, they had a reasonable basis

13

to detain and take to thestationhouse, these two individuals

14

and question them and check out their alibis, ascertain whether-:

15

or not these individuals could clear themselves in orderto

16

solve this crime involving Mrs. Addle Brown.

17

They could never revive Mrs. Addis Brownv but it was

18

incumbent upon these police officers, characterised as "petty

19

public officials," to work from daybreak to backbreak in order

20

to solve this crime so that there would not be more Addle

21

Browns, figuratively speaking, in Bronx County in the City of

22

Hew York.

23

they had to interrogate and X respectfully submit they went

24

into the streets and they knew, these police officers, they knew

25

Melvin Morales.

Melvin. Morales.

Morales.

j
And this hoy in court identified Melvin Morales an

the individual he saw at the time of the homicide? and this
little boy stated that he saw this individual on the day °—
oh the Wednesday following the Saturday night or Sunday
morning that he saw the individual at. the bench in- front of
this woman.
How, the Court's notion of probable cause is lass
than the conservative attitude of both prosecutor and police
officials with regard to probable cause, as evidenced by the
Peters case.
And 1 say to this Court that if there was probable
cause or this Court was able to find probably cause from the
Peters case or in the Peters case, certainly the Court may
very well find from the record we have here, which we were
not able to develop because the question of unreasonable deteny

tion was never raised in sfche trial court? it was not raised in.
the Appellate Division, our Intermediate Appellate Court? it
was first raised ~ raised for the first time in the Court of
Appeals o
Certainly, if it was raised, I respectfully submit,

24

1

we would haw had an opportunity to develop evidence and pro­

2

duce evidence which would show how all of this information

3

interwove, and'whether or not we had, indeed, additional infor­

4

mation which would enable us to have probable cause to make the

S

arrest.
But I state thaton the record itself, there was a

0
7

reasonable basis, which I contend,is all that the Fourth Amend­

S

ment requires — a reasonable basis todefain this individual

9

in order to interrogate him and all because there was a reason­

10

able belief that he had information concerning the commission

11

of 'this crime „

to go.

From the record the basis that we had to arrest

17

him was circumstantial evidence, indicating that the person who

18

committed this crime was a tenant in that building? that this

13

individual, Melvin Morales, was seen outside the premises of

20

the building, contemporaneous with the time just before or just

21

after Mrs, Addie Brown was killed; that this individual was a

I can’t give you — my opinion, sir, there are

20

23

about 60,000 narcotic addicts in the City of New York, and we

have our fair share*

And a fair share of those commit crimes?

A

A fair share

2

Q

What more cause did you have that this was

4

A

The evidence —

S

Q

At the time of the arrest.

6

A

— the fact» sir, that he was not seen in his

3

Morales?

7

usual haunts for a period of nine days subsequent to this

8

crime; that the mother stated at first that he was not in the .

9

apartment; stated subsequently that he was in the apartment;

10

that a boy saw him sitting on a .bench at the time that the crime

11

had bean committed.

12

And I state

further, sir, that when I use the term

13

arrest 1 equate it with seizure; 1 equate it with detention and

14

I state that the people or the state has the right to seize

IS

someone when they have a reasonable

16

that person has information with respect to a crime.

■17

equating that with his Fourth Amendment rights we take into

basis or believing that
And, in

13

consideration the entire totality of circumstances: the nature,

19

of the crime that was committed; the state of the investigation;

20

the individual himself who has been seized; whether or not the

21

afcmca&jhhee of the stationhouse would be so coercive to such an

22

individual who was ring-wise, that he would not be able to

23

cope 02' would be so cowed 'that his statement that he would make

24

after being advised of his rights would not be voluntary? hew

25

long he had been detained and certainly 1 believe that when one
29

1

is seised on-the basis that he may reasonably have information

2

with regard to a crime that that detention can only be for a

3

short period of 'time, rather than for

lengthy period of time•

The extent of time that this man was seised, as far as

4
3

his statement concerning his complicity in this crime,• was

6

concerned, was from 10 to 15 minutes, sir.

7

And based on those facts, sir, I believe thatunder the

Fourth Amendment, recognising that the standards applied by the

Fourth Amendment are flexible and variable? that the totality-of

police actiony and indeed, I do believe it is appropriate

3

police action, then certainly in this case where police officers

4

have interrogated numerous individuals; where they have a

3

reasonable basis for Interrogating this individual, Kelvin

6

Morales, and do, in fact interrogate him? and when Kelvin

7

Morales has an opportunity to interpose his own free will, and

8

within ten minutes, readily admits and confesses to this crime

13

How soon after the — ox* how long before the

12

arrest — 1811 put it that way — did the police discover that

'33

he had not been coming to his home to sleep and was not around?
A

14

.

I believe it was two days ~~ it was two days
<r

15

thereafter they suddenly discovered that he was not around.

16

Presumably sometime after the person of Morales

description was identified as being near the entrance of the

building before, or after the crime?

tod this evidence,:

Did the mother and any testimony pinpoint how she

knew that he was in her apartment# the family apartment at 3s00
a,m. or whatever the time

h

of this .crime was?

She. stated that he was sleeping on the dining

room table at that particular time and that when the police
arrived at the apartment he was then sleeping on the table.
And this is refuted by one of the detectives# I believe Detec­
tive Tejceira# who testified that he walked through the apart­
ment and actually walked through this room and did not observe
anyone sleeping on the dining room table.

MR, FARRELL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

I would very briefly like to return the Court's atten­

In spite of the intricate complex of facts upon which

|

21

the police officers might have operated to seise Morales, we

22

have summarised in our brief on Pages .3.3 and 14 and over to 15, j

the facts upon which they actually did operate.
They actually )

The reach of the police officers here — it’s act limited to

Melvin Morales — but these p&sfy officials, to borrow from

6

-- I was'wrong, it was from James Otis's speech in 1761 — the

police officers h$r@, these petty officials, have•in their

police officers, who is a suspect»

Honors.
tod the second point to which I would like to address

12

the Court's attention was th© attack on the admissibility of

13

Morales's confession was not an attempt to find a way around

14

otherwise overwhelming proof of guilt»

15

confessions, there is nothing to tie him to the crime committed

16

in this case.,

17

Absent of Morales's

As a matter of fact, the clothes that it is clear that

18

he was wearing on the night in question had been turned into a

19

elearhihg establishment bn October 5th,

The police laboratory in examining those clothes, found no

22

traces of blood»

The woman in the clean­

If Your Honors look at the pictures in the s

of

24

the scene of the crime, there is blood on the floor; there is

25

blood on the wall; there is blood on the door»

41

Morales's

1

clothes showed no signs of blood and it is the People’s -own

2

testimony that points to these clothes as the clothes as being

3

worn by Morales on the night the crime was supposed to have

4

been committed.

3

The only item of clothing missing was his shoes, but

5

his trousers — if you look :at the pictures in the record,

7

Your Honors, how his trousers could escape from being covered

3

with blood and gore? hoW his 31-stab-wound victim, or alleged

9

victim, could not have blood on him, entrenches upon almost a

10

lack of proof of guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt, absent these

13

confessions.

12

tod Your Honors, as I think the Court well understands
....

13

our position is that the confessions are the produce of an

!4

unlawful seizure and therefore, should be denied from use on

15

this trial.
