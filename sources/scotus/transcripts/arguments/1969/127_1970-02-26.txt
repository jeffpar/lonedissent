ORAL ARGUMENT BY ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM, ESQ»
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

MR» AMSTERDAM:

7

Mr» Chief Justice and may it please

8

the Court:

The principle thrust presented in this case is one

9

that is entirely familiar to the Court»

It is the question

m

which this Court has wrestled with, frequently, for better

n

than 35 years: whether, in a state criminal proceedings, or in

12

this instance, a juvenile delinquency proceeding resulting in

13

a sentence of life imprisonment»
A defendant's confession was inadmissible in evidence

14

15

because involuntarily obtained by the police» This case arises

16

prior to the cutoff date of Escobedo and of Miranda,

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

You make no Miranda argument; I take it?

A

There is no Miranda argument, Mr» Justice? at

all.
The issue of admissibility of the confession is
entirely the traditional one of voluntariness, and for that
reason, turns on all of the factual circumstances
of the case.
x
It is for that reason that in our brief I tried to
sat forth in all the details that, the Court might wish, the
exact factual circumstances under which the confession was
2

obtained.
As I understand the State' s. position in its brief
it initially asserts that it agrees with all of Petitioner’s
facts in the case.

However, in the argument portion of this

brief, it does make certain factual assertions with which we
are in disagreement.

There are a half dozen of those and X

mean to advert to them specifically in my presentation,
because I think the most important aspect of this case is the
facts.
We begin with what is clearly a major factor in the

1f

case, and that is the Petitioner's age.

12

detention, interrogation and confession he was a 15-year-old;
to be exact, 15 years and four months old.

13

The State, of course, does not contest that.

14
15
16

v/ish to bring to the Court' s attention.
First, it characterises the Petitioner as "above
average” and indicates that he had an intelligence beyond his

18

20
21

22
23
24
25

But it

does make three factual assertions in that regard, which 1

17

19

At the time of his

mere age.

The State citas nothing in the record on either of

these propositions; the Court will find nothing in the record
1
to support either of these propositions, and as X take it,
it is an inference of the Respondent, drawing from nothing
other than the fact that the Petitioner managed to hold out
for a goodly time to sustain police questioning.
.

The second factual matter raised by the State in
3

1

connectionwith Petitioner's individual characteristics» is

2

that he was, as the State puts it, "court-wise," or in another

3

place in its brief, "a hardened juvenile criminal."

4

Again, the record shows no such thine.

The facts in

5

this regard are set forth in our brief at page 46 in the

6

footnotes 59.

7

Petititioner previous to this detention and interrogation had

8

been a probationer of fee Juvenile Court.

9

what caused him to be a probationer of the Juvenile Court and

The trial record here shows only that the

It does not show

10

it does not show what contacts, if any, he had had with the

ii

police incident to becoming a probationer of the Juvenile

12

Court.
There are, however, psychiatric reports in this

13
14

record, one of which we advert to in our footnote, which shows

15

that as of a time three months prior to his detention the only

16

run-ins he had had with the police were a minor pilfering

17
18

incident: stealing a flashlight and jacket from a car? a
broken window incident and some misconduct inschool.
In reviewing the record for this argument, I notice

19

20

that 1 omitted from that footnote that the same diagnostic

21

report also indicates a charge of waywardness, whatever that

22

may be, sometime prior to 1953 when he would have been 11 or

23
24
25

12.

Again, no indication as to whether he had dealing with

the police in thatconnection.
And for the sake of completeness, I simply want to
4

1

bring to the Court's attention that there is another psy-

2

chiatric report made later after his prison juvenile commit­

3

ment ,, in which, under sodium amatol interviews and methadrine

4

interview,

5

6
7

at the State Diagnostic Center, Petitioner also

adverted to two additional contacts with the police.

However,

j
this came out under amatol; it is quite unclear what these
contacts were and thhre is no objective verification of this
i

8

amatol material.
In any event, he hardly is shown by this record to be

9
10

a hardened juvenile criminal.
hnd finally, the State says that the Petitioner was,

11

12

and I quote: "Familiar with the ability to take refuge in
I

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

silence."

That is. cjarefully-phrased statement to the extent

that it seems to. assert that there is anything in this record
showing that the Petitioner knew anything about his privilege
of self-incrimination or his right to resist police questioning.
It isv again, totally unfounded in the record.
The only material cited by the State to support it is
a statement that at one time the Petitioner was, in fact,
totally silent during five minutes 'of particularly sustained
police questioning.

There is no indication that he knew of

his right to maintain and retain that silence.
So, I think what we end up with in terms of the
personality and nature of this Petitioner, is that he was
simply a 15-year-old boy.

I cannot honestly claim that there
5

1

is anything in the record indicating that he is subnormal, but

2

I think there there is certainly nothing in the record to

3

indicate that he supernormal, in any regard.

4

We turn then, to what happened to this 15-year-old

S

boy.

6

which led to his confession, he was detained without «access

7

to friends, family or an attorney for a ten-day period.

8

1 am quick to admit that this detention has none of the

9

aggravating trappings that has sometimes attached to cases

First, it is undisputed that, prior to the interrogation

12

tained in the juvenile home, and he was questioned by the

13

police on four occasions: one immediately after his arrest,

14

then several days later after having weakened when the police

15

attention focused on him in connection with these cases, then

16

as soon as a lie-detector expert could be gotten, and finally,

17

several days later on the day in which he confessed.

He was simply de­

The important thing, however, about that detention

18
19

— there are, 1 think, two important things about the deten­

20

tion.

21

of the police andthe juvenile authorities„ and indicates that

22

they were far more concerned with their investigation than

23

they were with this 15-year-old's welfare and that of his

24

family.

25

mother had called the police andhad called the juvenile

It shows a very considerable callousness on the part

He had been away fromhome prior to his arrest.

6

His

i

authorities and she had made continuing inquiries of him and

2

had been assured that as soon as he was picked up he would be

3

brought home.
In fact, when he was picked up he was detained for

4
5

ten full days and his mother never learned that he was in cus­

6

tody, until the newspapers printed thathe had confessed.

7

Now, the State suggests, and here is a fourth matter

8

in which we are in factual disagreement; the reason why Monks

9

never saw his parents during this period was that he didn't

10

want then.

11

this proposition.

12

fact that at the time of his arrest he was living away from

14

IS
16

17
18
19

20
21

home.

Again, the record has absolutely no suoport for
It seems to be an inference that from the

However, as I have indicated, his mother had made

steps to find him, both through the police and through the
juvenile authorities.

They knew that very well, and never got

in touch with her.
But if it were so that Monks was so far from his
parents that he felt that not even they, not even his mother
and his father could be called to help him in this situation,
it seems to me that bespeaks not strength and not a factor
which supported this boy in his ordeal with the police, rather
the converse„
Passing from thataspect

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Amsterdam, you may

continue.

4

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

S

If the Court please: Prior to the recess I had noted

6

Petitioner's ten-day detention prior to the interrogation that

7

produced his confession.
The most important result of that ten-day detention

3

0

is that, in fact, and to Petitioner's appearance, he was

10

completely subject to the will of the police throughout'that

11

period.

12

which he would appear in court.

13

knew, the police could hold him and question him whenever they

14

pleased until he confessed.

He was not being detained for some fixed time, after

Q

In fact, and as far as he

I!s like to get that time sequence clearer in

my mind now, Mr. Amsterdam.

He was in a juvenile detention

home at this period?
A

He was in a juvenile detention home for this

ten-day period.
Q

Does the record show whether the police were

regularly stationed there, or whether they cams intermittently
and left to talk with him?
A

There is no indication that they are regularly
/
stationed there. When he was arrested and before he was taken
to the juvenile home he was questioned for several hours by the:

9

1

police.

2

arrested until noon the following day.
Q

3

Indeed,, he was questioned from Is00 a.m., when he was

I just wanted to be sure we didn't have a ten-day

police station detention.
A

S

No, we do not.

We have only two days of police

6

interrogation in the intervening period after the first police

7

interrogation and prior to the day of his confession.

8

Q

Does it appear why they picked him up?

9

A

Yes.

10

He was arrested in connection with two

unrelated purse snatchings, which he admitted immediately.

11

However, he was being held, from all appearances for

12

questioning on these offenses because the police officers had

13

their attention called immediately to a similarity of motives

14.

between the crimes and on the Monday following the Saturday of

IS
16
17
18

his arrest, they began to question him on these two particular
offenses.

They applied to the juvenile court for leave to do

so; they were granted leave to do so and they began to do so.
Now, here we come to, perhaps one additional factual

19

matter in which we are in disagreement with the State, because

20

we believe that the implication to him was obvious, that he

21

simply had no right to refuse to answer police questions and

22
23
24
25

that the police would persevere in holding him and questioning
him, until he broke and confessed.

/

The State asserts in its bs?ie£ that the police in fact,
gave the Petitioner warnings of his right to remain sixent
10

1

at one point.

2

fers entirely to a warning given after the Petitioner had been

3

questioned on three days and during 12 hours on the third day

4

without any warning or caution of any sort by the police at any

S

time .

6

The State citation to support that assertion re­

It is undisputed that he was never given any warning

7

throughout the interrogation until he had twice orally con-

8

fessed to the offenses,

9

transcription of his statement, he was told: "We are going to

Thatpoint, and just prior to the formal

10

ask you to make a voluntary statement which you may make or you

11

may not make, as you please.

12

warnings on this record,

13

That is the sum total of the

I want to make absolutely clear that he did not know

14

and was not told at any time anything contrary to the clear

15

indication presented by the police, continual questioning, that

16

he simply was going tohave to answer,

17

Nc-w, I come, then, to the final critical day,

IS

and time is very important here.

19

before 7:00 a.m. he was up, because he ate breakfast at 7:00.

20

At 10:00 police questioning began.

15 hours did he see or speak to anybody other than his interro­

gators»

3

tioning of him is unclear, as it always is in these cases, but

4

by the police admissions, the minimum possible time thathe

could have beemmdar direct questioning was six-and-a~half or

8

And that account of the time leaves several un­

What is veryimportant is that this record makes clear

9
10

as no other record I have ever seen in this Court, what is going

11

on throughout the 15 hours, because it is misleading to imagine

12

that only six-and-a-half of that or seven of that involved

14

the entire 15-hour period he was subject to discussion and

15

The point is that throughout

While he was not being questioned he was being con­

16
17

fronted with his friends who were brought in to say that he had

18

made admissions to them»

19

and while he waited outside the room to see what the result of

2©

that testing would be, he hovered around to the scene of the

So that the 15 hours, I think, have to be seen as a
12

!

block yndesr which this 15-year-old boy was sugjected to the

2

interrogative process and all of its pressures.

3

What is equally important is that he persisted, from

4

the very beginning in denying these offenses.

This is not one

S

of these threshold confessions, by any means.

The inquiry

S

here is whether he voluntarily confessed, whether ha willfully

?

confessed.

8
9
10

Now, for two days of questioning he did not.
hours yn the third day of questioning, he did not.
Q

If you eliminate the confessions, what, 'in your

'II

judgment would the record show?

?2

apart from the confession?

13

For 12

A

Is there enough to convict him

There is nothing — not only not enough, Mr.

14

Justice, there is no evidence, literally, pointing to his guilt,

IS

other than his confessions? absolutely none.

16

Now —

17

Q

We've never had a case, I guess, have we, in

18

which the person interrogated has had assigned to him bythe

19

juvenile court, somebody like this man,JarmoXowitz?

20
21

A

Never.

And that, is the one — and that is the

one legsl wrinkle'that makes this case different from any other,

22

Q

We haven’t had a case involving that?

23

A

No, Mr. Justice? not that I know of.

24
25

I mean to

come to that, because I think that it the nub of this ease.
Q

Mr. Amsterdam, didn’t you say that no other
13

1

evidence? what about his admissions to his friends?

a

A

They relate to the Weiss affair, which is an

3

affair which is not now in issue, because there are two

4

choices here: the so-called "Weiss affair," and the Giambfo

5

affair.

s

For the Weiss affair, he has already fully served all

7

the time he can legally under the New Jersey law.

8

thing that is in contention here is Giamforo.

9

to Giambro, there is one other confession.

The only

Now, with regard
That is a confes­

10

sion, or an admission, rather, made to, not a friend, but to an

11

inmate in the juvenile home, following and clearly derivative

12

of the confessions that are in contention here.

13

One could not find on this record that that confession

14

was not derivative of these.

15

admission clearly must fall.

If these confessions fall, that

16

Q

Well, why do you say that?

17

A

Because of his testimony.

He was explicitly

18

asked on cross-examination by the District Attorney: "Well, why

19

did you tell Talon in the receiving home that you had done it?"

20

Ha said: "I had been denying it all along; 1 admitted

2?

it to them and the eat was out of the bag; I then admitted if.

22

to everybody „s>

23

C

WE11, it doesn’t necessarily follow that any

24

admission following a coerced confession is also coerced; I

25

don't suppose.
14

A

1

Mr. Justice, 1 think that the clear implication

2

of this Court's holding in Robinson

S

Justice Harlan's opinion in Darwin, is that the State, at

4

least has the burden after a first involuntary confession is

5
6

?

given of showing that the subsequent confession is not tainted
by it and is not involuntary»

1 do not assert that it could not be made.

Now, what actually went on in the course of the police
questioning
Q

.13

14
15
16
17

20
21

22
23
24

Before you go on, Mr. Amsterdam, I’d just like

to clear up one other matter.

Was there anything in the desc­

ription given by this woman before her death, before she died,
that linked him up with the attack?
a brown — dark leather jacket.

They said it was a man in

Was there any follow-up on

that?
A

18
19

I assert

that on this record it is not made.

10
11

No such showing is possible or

could be made on this record.

she said.

"brown leather jacket."

Monks5 jacket was black and the jacket

25
15

was equally tainted by the confession.

2

3

there would be no question whatever that the jacket would fall#

confession„

And# as I say# on-and-off question­

Now, I come to Mr.- Justice Stewart's question about the

1€

1

probation officer»

2

a case of coarced confession it wouldn't even be up here if it

3

weren't for the probation officer.

4

tohave done is to rely exclusively on the presence of the

S

probation officer to distin-. uish this case from Haley, and as I

©

read the Respondent’s brief, almost exclusive reliance was

7

plciced on the probation officer there, too»

What both courts below seem

So, the question now is down to this: whether, where

8
9

I think that this case x<?ould so clearly be

the interrogation itself, which the probation officer was

10

present sit and did not stop, clearly makes a case of coercion

11

under Haley, where is near presence, doing nothing, changes the

12

result and somehow makes the confession voluntary.

13

that regard, 1 have several specific, factual points»

If the prefatory statement made today by counsel was

all that there was to this case, I am frank tc say, here and
now, that the State would confess error.

But ha very adroitly,

and I am sure, very skillfully has kept the most important
distinctive, significant fact of this entire case, for the last
factor, and only when questioning by the Court has brought it

forth»
The most significant fact in this case and which makes
this case different from any others, was anticipated by Justice
Stewart, when he said; "Had tills Court ever decided the question
involving a juvenile where the confession wasmade in the
presence of a court-assigned representative?"

21

at once and a probation officer is assigned to him and stays

with him,'5---

And the Arizona Supreme Court has held that this rule

17

does not prevent the police from .questioning a juvenile? it

18

only prevents them from subjecting the juvenile to formal

19

interrogation without permission of the person appointed, and

20

that it is consistent with the rehabilitative process of the

21

juvenile court to see that he's prevented from oversealous

22

questioning.

On February 18th the Prosecutor’s office, after

noting similarities between the purse-snatchings for which he
hadbeen arrested on the 16thf decided to interrogate this
juvenile and being in the shelter, they applied to the judge
26

of the Juvenile Court for permissions© interrogate him.

judge granted permission on the condition that such interroga­

3

tion take placeonly, and at all times, in the presence of the

4

probation officer, Mr. Chester Jarmolowicz.

5

On February

The

8th, in the presence of Chester

6

Jarmolowicz, at the Children's Shelter, this juvenile was

7

interrogated and he made a. slip of the tongue in which he said

8

— they,. mentioned something to him about "Did you engage in

9

any purse-snatchings on 3 st Street, 32nd Street, 28th Street,

10

and enumerated this east side section of Paterson and when it

11

came to 3 st street, which is where the Weiss assault took

12

place, he says: "Oh,"he says, "I have an alibi for that one."

3

No one asked him or even mentioned anything about Weiss.

and where the victim Giambro was going the evening when she
was assaulted and later died.

He said, "Oh,

read about that

in the paper? I had nothing to do with that."
And with as a starting point, the Prosecutor's
detectives said to him: "Willie, would you submit to a lie
detector test," and this juvenile, aged

"They're a fake? they don't prove anything,

even when you submit to them.
"Very well," and that's all the interrogation that
took place that day.

On the 21st, two days later, arrangements were made

2

for the polygraph operator to interrogate this juvenile and

3

the interrogation took place in an anteroom of the grand, jury

in the court house in Paterson.

The tests were submitted, not

lengthy, and immediately after ha was taken back by the

In the meantime, the Prosecutor's office, pursuing
their own independent investigation, and they came up with the
names of a few of his friends and associates, two of whom
one was named Ogg and the other one was named Stopford.

They

interrogated them and they found out from them that this 'Monks

The fact is that during a particular lull when the
when the detectives went, to another part of the

room and were conferring about trying to piece together various
things that had already been developed, the probation officer
sat alone with this juvenile and he said to him: "Willie," he
says, "I don51 want you to say anything to these police officers
unless it9s the truth, and I don't want you t© worry about this ■

31

juvenile from a probation officer* because* bear in mind* that

5

case involving the Nebraska Statute on Juveni3.es* as to whether

6

there was a right of trial byjury* which this Court did not

Q

Gault made that much different.

2

A

That’s true? that’s true,

3

I don't think that Gault has so overshadowed the

4

entire juvenile process that it has, as Justice Douglas said,

5

"converted the jtjvenile court into a trial for juvenile

8

erteinals«"
I don't think that has yet happened, whether» it will

7
8

or not, the future will determine that factor»
The fact is —

9

Q

10

Well, I thought you said it was a matter of

11

interrogation»

If you tell him he is entitled to counsel now

12

and he said, "I want one,” you’d have to appoint one? wouldn’t

13

you?

14

A

He gets one? he gets one»

15

The fact is, in our judgment that most of the argument,

IS

of Petitioner in this case has been what I will choose to

17

describe an inflation ©f the significance of what are not such

18

serious matters? or as the phrase has once been; "there has

19

been an abundant resort tc labels in this case, labeling

20

everything that has been happening, that has happened here as

21

being of a terrible nature and trying to put them all together

22

to come up with the phrase, "a callous disregard of the rights

23

of this particular accused," in order to justify and finally

24

come up with the prescription that there was an involuntary or

25

coerced confession»
36

I

I submit, gentlemen, that what has been happening here;

2

by the Petitioner's description of the various acts that are

3

in this record and that are likely as well, to b® innocent and

4

free from the terrible connotations placed upon them, was the

j
i

5

imposition of what one of the former justices of this Court

6

referred to as "The tyranny of ravings»

1

We think that in this case the presence of the

8

probation officer, the overall conduct of the police, in their

9

interrogation, which was fair, reasonable, humoring and

10

human and civilised, did not add up to such a destruction©f the

11

will, or such an overbearing of the ability of this juvenile

12

to withstand the interrogation, as to constitute an enforced,

13

coerced or run-down confession,,

14

We think that, on the total record and on the
*

15

totality of all of the circumstances taken together, without

16

fragmentation or isolation, that there was in this case,

17

"callous disregard of the rights of this juvenile,” but that

18

there was a fair, reasonable and decent regard for his rights

19

and that this confession in this case was voluntary and should

20

be sustoiined®

Is this youngster in for life?■

Yes? he is,

Mr, Kreiger, before you sit clows.: what does

for parole before 13-and-a-half years.

been up for parole* I know, as much as four times,
Q

YOu are suggesting that his chances are that he

will* in fact, will not serve more than 13-and-a-h alf years?
A

That's my suggestion; that's my best judgment.,

Q

And Giarabr© is the only thing in issue here.

He has served his Weiss sentence for five years?
A

Under the 1958 Act which was held retroactive,

even though he was adjudicated in '57* because it was bene­
ficial to the juvenile and not held, because forth© first time
it did away with indeterminata sentences inthe ceise of juvenile!;
and provided for fixed terms not to exceed age 21* except in
homicides.
If the Court would ask for argument on the second
point dealing with the question as to the validity of the life

sentence, otherwise I would rely upon my brief and the argument:!

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM, ESQ.

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MR. AMSTERDAM:

22

If I may just advert briefly to the

23

questions the Court asked and to statements of Mr.Kreiger.

24

have five very short factual matters and then I will get to
Mr. Justice Harlan's question.

25

42
i

I

1

Firstf with regaz”d to Mr. Justice White9s question,

a

Mro Kreiger stated initially that during the ten days the boy

3

was being held on those other purse snatchings and then ad­

4

mitted, in effect that that was not so.

5

the record that will support the contention that he was being

6

held in connection with the purse snatchings.

There is nothing in

The ■ record —

7

Q

It8 s not that he was arrested for them —

3

A

He was arrested for them? that8s right.

9

Q

10

A

11

But, as Mr, Kreiger has stated, New Jersey law will

He was taken into detention, he was detained ~
Correct.

12

be unclear as to whether he should be released under that

13

situation and the clarification here is that he was held be­

14

cause he was being investigated for the Weiss and Giambro

15

matters.

16

Secondly, Mr. Kreiger8s statement that the boy was

17

estranged from his family and that that explains to Mr. Justice

18

Marshall why the mother wasn't called.

19

tacted the police two or three times and the juvenile authori­

2©

ties more, asking that this boy be brought, home when he was

21

picked up.

22

knew that and the parents were not contacted.

23

The mother had con-'

And both the police and the juvenile authorities

Third, in response to Mr. Justice Marshall's question

24

about whether he was told about tie probation officer's role.

23

Mr. Kreiger has said that he will file something responsive to

that»

I think the Court will find at pages 200 and 201 of the

2

appendix all that there is.

been assigned to "stay with him,™ and that's it.

It supports my statement that he

statement as to what the probation officer told the boy.

Finally, with respect to Mr. Justice Black's question:

I think, Kir. Justice Black, that you will not find in the

record, the original record, any indication of the number of

prior incidents of this boy.

There is no such thing in this

44

1

Nowe if X may —

2

Q

3

The record shows that he was five feet*, eight

inches tali,

4

A

Pardon me?

5

Q

In response 'to my question # the record shows

6

he was 5 *8" tail»

7

A

1 believe that’s correct.

8

Q

That’s what he said he was» about.

9

A

I believe that's correct.

Now» if I may speak very briefly# having only a minute

10
11

left# to Mr. Justice Harlan's point.

12

sentencing question is a fairly straightforward application

13

in Paterson# with one wrinkles there is no doubt that when this

14

boy’s

15
16
17

18

required nor was any charge made at the original juvenile
trial, which was fchathe was adjudicated a delinquent on the
basis of an offense which would be first degree murder.
That involves findings not made at the time of the
trial# within the mailing of Specht, a new fact.
Under New Jersey law evidence is admissible# going to

21

22
23

24
25

maximum sentence was determined# subsequent to his

original trial# that a finding was made which was neither

20

We think that the

that fact# such as evidence of diminished capacity? in this
case

psychiatric evidence which wasnot put in by his counsel#

as it should not have been at the original trial# since it
didn't matter what degree of homicide
45

he was found guilty of,

1

as a juvenile, prior to the new statute.

2

Mow, the only question,, therefore, is whether or not

3

Specht applies if the new finding of fact is required, not by

4

antecedent legislation, but by subsequent legislation which

B

state law chooses to make retroactive.
As far as I can see, that makes no difference, what­

0
7

ever.

It is the State of Mew Jersey which has chosen to

8

say that a differentiation between two classes of people

9

should be mades those who have been found guilty of first

10

degree homicide and those with lesser degrees.

11

The difference

The difference in this ease is the difference

14

That fact is a critical fact? it was not in issue.

15

The STafce has put it in issue by the new legislation and we

16

think that the Petitioner had a right to a hearing on it.
Q

17
18

What was the juvenile proceeding in which he

was found to be a delinquent?

What was his defense?

19

A

The juvenile delinquency.

The charges were —

20

Q

.No; 1 didnt' say offense.

I said how did he

21

defend the charge; what did he have to say about the question

22

of 'whether or not he was a delinquent at that proceeding?

23
24

25

A

Not guilty?"! didn’t dona it.’5

Q

Did he have an alibi? did he say he was somewhen

else?
46

He has an alibi? that is correcto

And I want to make very clear that 1 disagree with the

State entirely, that that is inconsistent with diminished

6

not like the defense of consent in a rape case, which is in­

7

consistent with alibi.

8

are dealing with a juvenile who may be defective# retarded.

Remember the court here ordered psychiatric treatment for this

boy when they originally committed him# simply tells the court

11

that if he did do it# which he says he didn't do it# then he

12

hasn't got the capacity to be .guilty of first degree murder.

13
14

There is no inconsistency there# a good trial lawyer could
present those —
Q

15

My Second question about thafcproceeding is what was

16

1?
18

the burden of proof required to show his delinquency in that,
proceeding, under Hew Jersey law?

21

Well, that answers my question.

In the initial proceeding.

In which he was shown to be delinquent.

A

I must admit I do not know the answer to that

question.

Perhaps Mr. Rreiger could enlightenyau.
