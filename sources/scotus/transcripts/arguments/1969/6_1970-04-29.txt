ARGUMENT OF DEAN H. B11, TON, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. BXLTON:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court;

9

This is an appeal from the entry of an interlocutory

10

injunction by a three-judge court after that three-judge court

11

found one subsection of the Illinois Intimidation. Statute uncon­

12

stitutional on its face.

13

over-broad.
The statute is part of the Illinois Criminal Code,

14
15
16

That Court said that the statute was

Chapter 38, Section 12-6 (a) (3).

That; is a rather short statute

and may I just read it to you.,
It says that "a person commits intimidation when, with

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

the intent to cause another to perform or to omit the performance
of any act, he communicates to another a threat to perform with­
out lawful authority any of the following acts."

And the part

that we are involved with today is threat to commit any criminal
offense.
I was quits shocked this morning when I opened up
the Washington Post and found out thc.t this was supposed to be
a case that dealt with mob violation and some kind of mob action,
2

1

aid for a year or so in the Law Week they ascribed this to some

2

kind of a statute that prohibits threats.

3

not prohibit threats.

4

statute is a crime against a person and it is so codified in

5

Illinois.

This statute does

It is not a public order statute.

This

This is an extortion statute and extortion is a rob­

6
7

bery.

3

"Give me your money or I will do something to you right now” and

9

extortion is "Give me your money o.r I will do something to you

10

The only difference between extortion and robbery is

in a short while or a little bit later."
And I see that this morning we are joined with the

11
'12

Younger case, with the Criminal Syndicalism case and the Fer­

13

nandez case,, all of them involving anarchy and public order.

14

The case coming up tomorrow is a misconduct case, also an

15

obscenity case.
This is really quite, quite different.

1G

This is a

17

crime against a person and the object of protection here is the

18

person and his right to keep his money in his pocket, and we

19

think that to take that man’s money away or threats being used

20

as weapons to remove that money are never considered to be

21

speech.

22

tially this statute is just not unconstitutional as being a viol a-

23

tion of the First Amendment.

24
25

And for that reason, of course, we feel that very ini­

We may have misled this Court in reaching this con­
clusion about this being a statute which prohibits threats and

1

we set out the question presented on page 4 of our brief.

2

Our question presented said that this statute is an

3

extortion statute and that it deals with threats to commit

4

crime.

A more accurate statement would be that this is a stafcut

!P

5

that prohibits one from taking or attempting to take the propert

7

6

or the protective rights of another through the use of threats

7

to commit crime, and we think it is in that light that this

8

statute ought to be viewed.
The very first issue in this case is one of standing.

8
10

The plaintiffs here were seven subclasses of black people in

11

Chicago, all claiming to be black activists and all pending

12

certain state charges, and the defendants here were all members

13

of the officialdom of the City of Chicago, County of Cook, who

14

were charged with the prosecution of the appelles.

15

appellees were charged with this intimidation statute at any

13
1?
18

None of the

\

time and there are no pending state charges against the appel­
lees .
The appellees in their complaint stated that all the

19

statutes involved, and there were five of them, including mob

20

violence, resisting arrest, aggravated assault, aggravated

21

battery, intimidation, were all being used by the defendants in

22

furtherance of a bad faith conspiracy to keep these appellees

23

from exercising their First Amendment rights.

24

Dombrowski allegations of a killing effect and a bad faith con­

25

spiracy and they say these words.
4

And they used the

There was an answer filed denying this conspiracy and

1

a three-judge court sat and heard the threshold question of the
constitutionality of this statute on its face.
By the way, there never has been a trial on the merits

of this complaint.

to do the acts of which they were accused in the complaint.
Q

15

Did the three-judge court issue an injunction or

just a declaratory judgment?
A

?0
11

There has been no proof of any bad faith

The three-judge court issued a declaratory judg­

ment and then it issued pursuant to that a declaration that this
subsection of the Intimidation Act was unconstitutional, and
then issued a blanket injunction stopping state attorney's offic
of Cook County from prosecuting anybody under this particular
subsection.

1G

Q

You did have a prosecution.

A

There never was any prosecution of any plaintiff

here under this statute at all.

advisory sense, was it not?
A

21

22

It was a declaratory judgment in the broadest

In the very pure broad abstract sense, that is

correct.

23

By the way, the one subsection of the Intimidation

24

statute that was set out in the complaint was a section that

25

refers to intimidation by public officials.
5

I wouldn't have

2

3

that he shouldn't have done.

It was an intimidation by a

So truly when we went to hearing before the three-judg

4
5

court,, no one really understood what was the problem with the

6

intimidation statute.

7

court opinion that we find out and discover that the court

8

thought that this one subsection was over-broad.
Looking at standing the court said that the plaintiffs

9

10

It was not until after the three-judge

had standing because they were not charqed with any of the often
ses here and thaty therefore, they came under the right of the

11

12

Dombrcwski case and the Zwickler case to give such people declar iitory judgments when they claim that their First Amendment rights

13
14

are being infringed upon.
We submit to this Court that both Dorabrowski and

15
1G

Zwdckler are quite distinguishable and in both Dombrowski and

17

Zwickler the plaintiffs there had a history in Louisiana and in

IS
19

New York of having the statutes that they complained about being
used against them.
Mr. Dorabrowski headed up his organisation in Louisiana

20
21

22
23
24

and he was arrested and he was charged with violating a Louisiana
sedition statute, and then a motion to quash stopped that prose­
cution against Mr. Dombrowski.

He then went into the Federal

Court and sought to stop future prosecutions under that over-bro xd
statute.

25
6

i

So we had a history of facts that he could point to

2

and said, "Look, they are going to do it to me again."

3

the State of Louisiana accommodated Mr. Domhrowski by raiding

4

him again shortly after he filed his complaint in the District

5

Court and indicted him under this sedition statute.

In fact,

In the Zwickler case, a New York man who was distribut­

8
7

ing handbills anonymously, he was arrested and he was found

3

guilty under a New York statute that said you can't distribute

9

election campaign literature anonymously in quantity.

His con­

10

viction was later overturned by the New York Supreme Court on

11

the criminal element, but it didn't reach the constitutional

12

point.

13

Zwickler then went to the U. S. District Court, filed

14

his comolaint for declaratory judgment and said, "I am going to

15

do the same thing in the next election and they are going to

1G

apply the statute to me again in the next election."

17
18

19
20

So he,

too, had some facts he could point to to justify his conclusion
that the state was going to apply this over-broad statute agains ;
him.
Now in our case none of the 15 or so named plaintiffs

21

nor the organisation act or any of the plaintiffs that joined in

22

later on were ever charged with this intimidation statute.

23

didn’t say anything about it in their complaint.

24
25

They

So we don't believe that a person has a right to come
into a District Court and the magic words, "My First Amendment
7

!

rights are being chilled"and that gives him an automatic right

2

to get a declaratory judgment of any statute he so chooses.

3

that is what happened in this case.
So for those reasons we do not believe that the plain­

4
5

6
7
8
9

And

tiffs hare, in the first case, had any standing to challenge
the act that they did.

I will admit, however, that both Dorn-

browski and Zwickler do give the Federal Courts jurisdiction
to sit. in declaratory judgments when a person is not charged witi i
a pending state case.
Now, looking at the statute itself on its merits,

10

11

we do not believe that the statute is unconstitutional.

12

our brief from page 13 to page 20 we have a compilation of First

13
14

Amendment cases, as best vie could, and we drew two conclusions.
And that is, one, that First Amendment cases are treated, on a

15

case-by-case basis..

16

interest of the seeker against whatever state interest is

17
IS
IS

And

The rule of law seems that you balance the

involved.
Well, in this statute, the interest of the seeker is tha
of a thief.

He is attempting to take something from another per­

20

son by the use of threats, and the protected interest involved

21

is the state9s right to protect individuals in their person, in

22
23

their safety and in their possessions.
We don't think there is any contest here.

On that

24

test along the statute should, be considered a valid exercise of

25

the state's power and and not over-broad statutes.
8

9s

I believe that the three-judge court misunderstood

2

this statute because it said that the statute was over-broad

3

because it prohibited threats of insubstantial evil»

4

in incorrect in two ways.

5

prohibit threats.

6

bits robbery by threats, but it doesn’t prohibit threats in the

7

abstract.

First of all, the statute doesn’t

People can get up and speak about advocating crime.

8
S

Well,, this

They can get up and threaten all they want.

If there is no extc

10

tion element present, this statute doesn't prohibit that kind of

11

conduct.

12

Q

Would demand for ransom come under this statute?

13

A

"Give me your money or I will commit a kidnapping

15

Q

Or "Give me your money because I have your child,

13

17

Q

This overlaps with the kidnapping statute?

18

A

In that sense, it probably would overlap with

14

yes.

19

kidnapping,

20

the same kind of a statute, depending on how close the intimi­

21

dating factor is.

22

It would certs inly overlap with robbery because it

If I hold a gun to your head and says "Give me your

23

money or I will kill you in five minutes," 1 might be committing

24

extortion or I might be committing robbery, depending on whether

25

or not the incidence of violence is immediate or delayed.
9

Extortion is that statute which picks up where robbery

1
2

leaves off.

Yes, I believe that there is an overlapping with

3

other state statutes.
Secondly, the court in that one statement about the

4
5

statute prohibiting threats of insubstantial evil, the idea of

6

"insubstantial evil" is a question that the victim really has to

7

answer.

8

a major weapon to the victim.

What might be a very small weapon to a court might be

3

So when the court said that there are little crimes

10

which might not be too serious to a person, the court did not

11

place itself in the shoes of that victim.

12

kind of person that would be intimidated by a small offense.

He might be just the

Now to prove the point that the court, I believe,did

13

U

lose sight of object of the protection of this statute and thoug ht

15

that this was a public order statute, I would just like to point

1G

to the opinion, as set out in page 94 of our appendix, and may

17

I just read these few sentences here:
The court said, "Indeed the phrase ’commit any crimina 1

18

19
20
21

22
23

offense1 is so broad as to include threats to commit misdemeanor
possible by fine only.

These evils are not so substantial that

the state's interest in prohibiting the threat of them outweighs
the public interest in giving legitimate political discussion
of why it works.

Since the language of subnaragraph 8(3} isn

an, over-broad restriction on the freedom of speech, it is
24
invalid.

Obviously, however, if the threat is carried out, the

25
10

1

persons who violate the criminal lav/ by their acts are subject

2

to punishment,"
Well, this notion that it is better to let a man

3
4

threaten and speak to preserve the B’irst Amendment and then

5

arrest him when he commits action is a good notion for a statute

6

that protects public order.

7

money or 1 will break your windows later on" and you give me

8

your money, I never carry out the threat.
So the action here, the threat, is a weapon.

9

Q

10

11

But if I say to you, "Give me your

A

12

Of course, just as the caliber of the weapon

13

used in robbery is irrelevant,

I presume you could commit a

14

robbery with a gun or a pea-shooter.

15

seem to be very dangerous, but when held up next to someone's

Q

After all, the chilling effect on the victim.

A

Oh, yes, it is a chilling effect on the victim,

Yes.
1.1

1

So for that reason we believe the court was miscon­

2

struing this statute in such a way that they believe it was a

3

public order statute.

4

When it talked about "legitimate political discussion,

5

to this day I fail to see how intimidating a person to either

6

take his vote, try to threaten crimes against him or intimidat­

7

ing a public official by taking away his freedom of speech, by

8

threatening crimes against him can be considered "legitimate

9

political discussion."
Telling a Congressman, "Mr. Congressman, vote for my

10
11

program, advocate my program or I will commit an act of violence

12

and I will kill you.”

13

ing and I don't believe that this ought to be protected free

14

speech.
The court said, in holding this statute unconstitutional

15

16
17
18

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

This certainly is pretty powerful argu­

that the statute was not vague, but it was over-broad because it
had little crimes included in the threats of the criminal con­
duct.

A definition or what, is or is not "over-broad" was set

out by this Court in the Zwickler case.

And this Court said

that "over-breadth" is that which — a constitutional principle
that a governmental purpose to control or prevent activities
which can be subject to certain regulation may not be achieved
by means which sweep necessarily broadly and thereby invade the
area of protect freedom.
Now there seem to be two factors in this concept of
12

1

over "-breadth.

One is this wide sweep and one is the invasion

2

of the area of protected freedom.
Initially we do not think that the thief has any pro­

3
4

tected freedom to try to take property from another by threaten­

5

ing crimes.

6

have set out in our brief a comparison of this statute with the

7

Federal extortion statute and all the state extortion statutes.
Q

8
9
10

And as far as this "wide sweep” is concerned,, we

Mr. Bilton, suppose a man walks in a store and

says, "If you don’t hire Negroes, I will see to it that you get
no more profits."

Doesn't that violate this statute?

11

A

You get no more profits —

12

Q

Well, you walk — if he walks in the store and

13

says, "Either you give me some money or I am going to shoot you,

14

that takes his profits.

crime, Mr, Justice Marshall, you said that if you do not hire
more Negroes, we will shoot you and that you will receive no
more profits.

Q

Well, it is plain that if you say, "If you don’t

this statute.

15

A

That is correct.

10

It is a threat to commit a crime.

That is correct.

21

Q

"If you don’t hire Negroes, we will see to it tha-

22

23

under the statute.

24

A

That would not come under the statute.

25

Q

That would simply be a threat not a patronize the

Would that be cor­

3

A

That is correct, absolutely.

4

The threat here must be a threat to commit a crime.
4

5
6

And that was a section that was held to be over-broad,,
Q

Could a threat ba brought within the statute by

7

the innuendo, the immplications, reasonable implications, to be

8

drawn from the threat?

9

some cases in New York where the practices of extorting in

I recall, for example, back soma 20 years

10

Brooklyn, I think it was, was to go to a storekeeper and say,

II

"You pay us $25 a week or you won't be able to get plate glass

12

insurance any more."

13
14
15
16

17
18

The innuendo there was indirect that you won't be able
to get the plate glass insurance because there will be so much
breakage that no one will insure you.

That would found to be

something in a conviction to be sustained.
Would it be sustained under the Illinois statute?
A

Yes, it would.

The only problem there is the

19

problem of the prosecutor proving up all the elements of the

20

crime beyond a reasonable doubt, for he must convince the jury

21

that the words "viewed beyond a reasonable doubt*1 carried that

22

innuendo to have violence with his threats.

23

It is true it would cover our direct threats and three ; s

24

by innuendo.

We deal there,though, with problems of proof rather

25

than the abstract case that we have here.
15

1

3

Q

The statute would not be ovex'—broad in your view

because it permits proof of the innuendo?
A

Wo, I don't say it.

In that regard it. sits with

4

every other extortion statute in the country.

5

6

massage by innuendo.

7

8

You need not tell

What we are trying to protect is people from being
relieved of their possessions by force or by coercion.

S

We have set forth a comparison in our brief of rele­

10

vant Federal statutes, including the Hobbs Act and other state

11

statutes involving extortion, and we believe that our statute

12

in Illinois is far narrower them those acts which committed extor­

13

tion under the Hobbs Act.

14

I direct attention to Nick vs. The United States and

15

Newark vs. Compagna, both cited in our brief, where a person

16

committed extortion by threatening the movie industry to pull

17

out the projectionist unless he received an illegal payoff.

18

the act threatened was just to commit a tort or to commit an

19

unfaiir labor practice, an illegal strike.

20

Here

In Illinois, of course, we prohibit threats of crimes

21

and to do a crime is something far more narrower in scope than

22

to commit tort.

We have set out the Communications Act in the

23

Federal Government, xvhich prohibits extortion by telephoning a

24

person and injuring the reputation or threatening the reputation

25

of the person or of another person, either living of deceased,
16

1

which is certainly far broader in scope than the statute hers.,
Q

2
sJ

Of course, if you prevail on your Dombrowski poinj;

we don't any of this that you have been arguing about,
A

4

Well, if I prevail on ray Dombrowski point, that

5

is true.

8

tion of a statute —- our statute as it sits right now has been

7

declared by a three-judge court to be unconstitutional.
In all honesty, Mr, Zwickler was not under- a pending

8
9

to
11

We are left in Illinois with a no constitutional declara­

state charge when he went into court and neither was Mr, Dorabrow
ski.

For that reason the District Court in Illinois, knowing

full well that these people were not charged with the statute,

12

but seeing in their complaint that they were threatened by the

13

application of the statute by a bare face conspiracy, said that

14

they extorted the same position as Mr, Zwickler did.
Q

Well, the issuance of an injunction is what gives

this Cotirfc appellate jurisdiction under Section 1253,

17

A

Correct.

18

Q

And now having jurisdiction of this case, there

19

is nothing in the way of the court holding that it is improper

20

for the District Court not only to grant an injunction, but also

21

to issue a declaratory judgment under these circumstances.

is not here.

23
24
25

Q

That

The whole case is here.
Essentially the District Court's opinion on the

declaratory feature might kill the state courts from going ahead
A

Well, the opinion on the declaratory feature, of
17

I

course,, for all practical purposes takes away this particular

2

statute for all use in Illinois.

3

statute, we have seven other sections and we are not completely

4

devoid of an extortion law in Illinois»

It is» however, an omnibus

But this is a very important section, though, because

5

6

it is the one that allows us to cope with new and innovative

7

crooks.

8

extortion elements, the blackmail elements, threats to ruin the

9

reputation.

The other subsections are ones that are traditional

This section is the one that allows us not to sit

10

back and let a person commit extortion that isn't covered by the

11

other section.
Q

12

If he threatens a crime, then move in.
To go back to your response to Mr. Justice Stewart's

13

question, if by whatever process it is determined that the injunc­

14

tion -™ that there was no jurisdiction to issue an injunction

15

here in the three-judge court, then there is nothing here on

16

the declaratory judgment, because that would not be here, would

17
10
13

20
21

it?
A

Well, if this Court did rule that the appellees had

no standing to bring their complaint to the District Court
Q

Wo, you can't get a three-judge court for a

declaratory judgment standing alone, can you?

22

A

I peg your pardon. I didn't quite understand.

23

Q

You can't get a three-judge court case for a

24
25

declaratory judgment alone?
A

Wo, sir, you have to seek an injunction.

Every declaratory injunction

Well, if the standing to bring the case to court

fall, everything seems to fall with it, but there are other peop' Le

6

who will do the same thing again and might be charged with intim

1

dation and we are back again where we started, trying to support

a

a statute that is alleged to be over-broad.
And we have a holding in Illinois that the statute is

9
10

It

over-broad and the case is burst on the ground.

It would not

help the appellates in this case at all.
Getting back to our comparison, we did compare this

12
13

statute with all the other states.

14

having broader threats than ours do, and especially states such

15

as Utah which prohibits coercion or threats of any nature.

16

think our statute is quite narrow when drawn in comparison with

17

the statutes of the other states and of the Federal Government.

Whatever time I have left I would like to reserve for

rebuttal.

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Bilton.

ARGUMENT OF ELLIS E. REID, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

23
24

MR. REID:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

25

I would like to, first, address myself to the standing
IS

1

issue and then to the issue of the merits of whether or not my

2

analysis of the statute is over-broad and deterred First Amend­

3

ment freedom.

4

First ©f all,. I think Mr. Bilton got himself into the

5

problem with the standing issvse.

You see, in this particular

6

case, the history of the case is such that it is here only on

7

one particle of a broad problem that was brought to the court

8

below.
This case grew out of the situation in 1967 where

9
10

were five mass arrest,

11

of the local bar and some from out of town got together in

12

basically a Dombrowski complaint, taking from some of these mass

13

arrest situations, sometimes there have been 55 people arrested

14

and sometime as many as a hundred on other occasions and making

IS

them members or representatives of the class,,

situations,

a

committee of 22 lawyers

We have here seven subclasses of the total class.

16

One

17

subclass was arrested as a group on August 1, 1967, charged with

18

many crimes, mob action and disorderly conduct being the main

19

ones.

20

with mob action and disorderly conduct and resisting arrest and

21

a few other charges.

22

Another group was arrested on May 21, 1967, also charged

On September 14th another group was arrested and chargid

23

with mob action, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.

24

then again on August 23, 1967, another group was arrested and

25

charged with mob action, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.
20

Wow

1

And then, to round out this particular class

— oh, excuse me,

2

also on August 4, 1967, another group was arrested and charged

3

with mob action, disorderly conduct, and, I believe, also resist­

4

ing arrest.
Now, we added also a group know as ACT, which was an

S

s

incorporated association which more or less advocated the confron­

7

tation of public issues in a forum of the streets.

S

added as members of the class individuals who had no-: been

9

arrested or charged with anything, but merely were Negroes who

10

He also

wanted to speak out against what was happening in the City of

I?

Chicago at that time in 1S67, and we put them in a class and

12

alleged their First Amendment rights were being chilled by this

33

particular plan of action that was being perpetrated by the City

14

of Chicago on people of arresting them with no hope of convic­

15

tions, with high bonds and keeping them in jail sometimes two

16

weeks before we could go in on motions to reduce the bail and

17

get them out by raising the bail.
Now this Court in the Golden v. Litlis case said the

18
19

following language with regard to his standing, although very

20

probably you were addressing yourself to to the issue of moot-

21

ness.

22

and a controversy contemplated by the Declaratory Judgment Act

23

is necessarily one of degree, and it would be difficult if it

24

would be possible to fraction a precise test for determining in

25

every case whether there, is such a controversy.

But you said, “The difference between an abstract question

21

Basically the

question in each case is whether there is a substantial confer©”
/

versy between parties having adversa legal interests of suffi”
cient immediacy and reality to want the issuance of a declaratory
judgment."
And you cited in support of that the Maryland Casualty
Co. case.
Now in this particular case you have to know something
about the City of Chicago in order to understand how the intimi­
dation statute gets here.

The City of Chicago has a large

Corporation Counsel9s office, which is charged in many instances
1?

among other things,, with enforcement of the city's ordinances.
And in 1967 a gentleman named Richard Elrod, who later

12.
13

14

became a state legislator, but was at that time in the Ordinance
Enforcement Division of the Corporation Counsel's office, was

15

present at every major demonstration in the City of Chicago,

16

and he was the man on the scene charged with the duty of telling

17

the Chicago police who they would arrest, when they would effect

IS

the arrest and what, charges would be brought against the alleged

19

offenders.

20

Now he was present at each and every one of these

21

instances that I quoted to you in the complaint of the five groups

22

3f people that were arrested.

23

many as a hundred people.in these mass arrest situations.

24
25

Some 50 people, and sometimes as

Now it was Richard Elrod who dreamed up the notion to
Later use the intimidation statute, which didn't carry just a
22

1

year in jail or a fine* bat carried five years in jail.

And

2

when we as lawyers representing these people heard the threats*

3

we beat him to the courthouse* because we did not want anybody

4

charged with a felony that carried five years for merely pro­

5

testing in a peaceful way and try to seek a redress for their

6

grievances»

7

Now the reason that the standing issue was not raised

8

in the jurisdiction statement and the reason it just came up in

9

the brief o£ these particular appellants is that there were

10

several groups of people below the State Attorney's office repre

11

seated the defendants* who were county officials* and the Cor­

12

poration Counsel's office represented the defendants who were

13

city officials.

U

Counsel’s assistant in charge defending the city officials.

15

16
17

IS
19

20

And Richard Elrod* of course* was the Corporation

And it was Richard Elrod* I tell you* who dreamed up
the intimidation statute so the issue never came up* because
when the lawyers tried the case •--- and I am one of 22 who stuck
with the case — were in court with Mr. Elrod and with the other
lawyers who represented the county officials* obviously the
issue never came up because we knew* and everybody else knew*

21

that there was a substantial controversy about this intimidation

22

statute*that Mr. Elrod wanted to use it and we beat him to court

23

and the three-judge court agreed that as the statute was per­

24

verted or could be read* it was quite a chilling effect and had

25

a chilling effect on First Amendment freedoms.

23

Nov; Mr. Bilton has stood up here and. told you about

2

taking money from somebody.

3

was intended to be used and how you can read it in plain English

4

and it would stick.

5

of that statute a public official, and then you read the statute

8

that you will threaten him in order to get him to do something

7

or in order to fail to do something by committing a crime.

21

22
23
24
25

When you make a victim or a so-called victim

Then 1 submit to you that you have to read the entire

8
9

1 want to tell you how the statute

Criminal Code of the State of Illinois and also the ordinances
of the City of Chicago and the other municipalities in the State
of Illinois to determine whether or not you are threatening a
crime.
For example, as the three-judge court said, “If you
say to a public official either you will redress our grievances
or we will picket the city hall?

Nov;, if there is an ordinance

in the City of Chicago which prohibits the picketing of the
City Hall, you have just put yourself in a five-year noose to
stand trial for the intimidation statute, and that is why we are
here and that is why the three-judge court said clearly, this
statute as yet — and it can be read that way — is quite a
chilling statute as far as First Amendment freedoms are concerne 1.
And the court itself went through several examples.
I can quote, if I can find the examples, of people blocking an
intersection with baby carriages or people deciding to do things
which in and of themselves would be misdemeanors if carried

24

1

through to fruition..

And because you threatened to do a misde­

2

meanor , to bring a public official into the public forum to do

3

what he should do, then you are charged with a crime that car­

4

ries with it a five-year penalty.
1 say to you that this statute on its face is void

5
6

because it is over-broad, and as Your Honors got into the ques­

7

tioning with Mr. Bilton, there are many other statutes in the

8

State of Illinois and many other ordinances of the City of Chi­

S

cago which deal with conduct that may be antisocial or may create

10

harm to property or to persons.
I say to you that this is not such a statute, as it

11
12

is presently drafted.

13

Another thing, back on the standing issue, Mr. Elrod

14

himself, when he became a member of the Legislature, after the

15
16
17

initial three-judge opinion in this case, entered into the State
Legislature and had it passed a bill repealing this particular
statute.
And I don't know today whether or not the Governor has

18
.19

20
21

22
23
24
25

signed that repeal bill, but I do know that a letter was sent to
the Governor's office asking him to hold up on signing the
repealer, because it would moot the issue before the Court
today.
And I say to you what we are doing here -—
Q

Counsel, how do we know these facts to be whether

as they appear in this record?
25

A

1

They don't appear in the record, because the last

2

time I was hare to argue the case I didn't know that»

I found

Q

What is it you want us to do with respect to the sis

A

X think we can stipulate to the Court that a bill

was introduced and passed by the Illinois Legislature, because

it is a fact, repealing this section of the Intimidation Act of

23

Now I don’t know today whether or not

the Governor has signed that bill, but I am saying that the
gentleman who dreamed up this idea, Richard Elrod, introduced it
and saw that the bill was passed»
Q

Why is the evidence in the record that Mr. Elrod

st dreamed it up"?

Where is the evidence that ——

A

Well, there is basically — I may be ——

Q

Mr. Elrod's presence at all these meetings.

A

Mr. Elrod was the Assistant. Corporation Counsel.

Q

I know, but

is that in the record?

A

That is not in the record.

The thing is

that is

you read the record, you may sae that Mr. Elrod was a party to
this lawsuit, so far as representing some of the defendants who
are not here, and they would be the city officials.
Q

But how do you know that Mr. Elrod from anything

24

that we have before us was ever planning to use this statute

25

against anybody?
26

J

A

Only by our complaint, and our complaint is that

2

the threat was made and it is a question of whether or not the

'3

word "threat” is a conclusion, argued by counsel, or that it is

4

a fact.

S

complaint in paragraph 8 and again, I believe, in paragraph 24

$

of the complaint, paragraph 25 of the complaint, paragraph 34 of

?

the complaint, and paragraph 37 of the complaint where we all

8

say in all of these paragraphs that we have been threatened by

9

use of these statutes and the threatened us® of other statutes
*

10

that have not yet been used.
Q

It
12

And I am saying to you that the threat, as used in the

of those.

But there was an answer filed which denied all
Is there any proof?

13

A

The only thing that I am saying to you is--- •

14

Q

Was there any proof taken?

15

A

I am saying that ——

16

Q

Were any proofs taken?

17

A

No, and the reason is this question didn’t even

18

19

come up in the jurisdictional statement in this Court, in viola­
tion your rule 15.1(c), and I make? that a point in my brief.

20

In my brief I say that the question was not set forth in the

21

jurisdictional statement and fairly complies therein as required

22

by rule 15.1(c) of this Court.

23

Then I go on to say the question was one decided by a

24

single judge, from whose decision an appeal must be takers to the

25

Court of Appeals.

27

Now they filed a motion to dismiss and that is in the

I
2

record.

That motion to dismiss was denied by Judge Wills,, sittin g

3

as one judge before he convened the three-judge court,

4

saying that they had at that point a right to appeal that deci­

5

sion to the. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,

6

not to appeal.

1 am

They chose

And then whan the three-judge court was convened, they

7

8

went ahead and the three-judge court decided that on the face

9

of this particular statute it was over-broad and therefore uncon­

10

stitutional.
Now 1 am saying when you have a situation like this,

11
12

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22

where standing was never raised, and 1 must apologize, I must
go outside the record to give you the background of the reason,
the explanation for this.

It was never raised in the District

Court before Judge Wills.

An appeal was taken on the issue to

the Seventh Circuit, and than when the statute was knocked out
on its face, then for the first time in their brief, even after
filing the jurisdictional statement, as an afterthought — and
this was before the Golden case even — they decided that per­
haps they would have a shot at us before this Court because of
standing,, because no one was ever charged actually with the vio­
lation of the intimidation statute,
X .am saying to you, as you said in the Golden case,

23
24

you must look at the totality of all the circumstances before

25

the Court.

You cannot just pull ait one element of this case.
28

Q

1

What totality do we have.

A’s I see it, we have

2

several allegations that people had been threatened, and I could

3

read those in the text of the whole complaint, that -“hey are

4

threatened merely by the presence of the statute.
A

5
6

Wall, that may be the softest way to read it.

Thu

only way I am ——

7

Q

Well, what other way should I read it?

8

A

The only thing that I —

9

Q

There is no specificity here at all.

There are

10

no facts in this record at all that anybody has been told that

n

if you exercise your right of free speech you will bra charged

12

with, this crime.

There is not. one word in the record.

13

A

Let me answer it this way, Your Honor.

14

Q

Sure.

15

A

Whether or not you read the word "threat" as being

16

an allegation of facts or you read it as being a conclusion by

17

the pleaders.
How 1 say to Your Honor that, you have a perfect right

18

IS

to read that as a pleading of facts, because it is a fact that

20

wa are threatened by the use of this statute, and it is a plead­

21

ing of a fact.

22

and it is probably a problem in semantics as to whether or not

23

you will understand the word as hear it, "threat," to be a con­

24

clusion.

25

Q

We were threatened by the use of this statute

Well, I mean suppose a man in the Sanitation
29

1

Department picking up garbage says that if you don't give me

2

cleaner garbage, I am going to have you convicted under this

3

statute.

4

Would you consider that a threat?
A

Well , there must be a clear and present apparent

5

ability to carry out the threat, and I went to the record only

6

to explain that the person who made the threat was present in

7

court

8

ability to carry it out.

but the person who made the threat had the apparent

Q

9
10

And my personal trouble, Mr. Reid, is that 1 have

great difficulty in going outside of the record.
A

11

I understand, Your Honor.

But may I say this:

12

Your Honor does not have to go outside the record to deal with

13

this case and 1 will show Your Honors that you don't have to do

14

that.

13

is standing is a factual issue and although it may result in a

16

conclusion that may have jurisdictional effect, I ara still saying

17

that initially it was a factual determination to be made initially

18

by the district judge.

In this particular case the issue of whether or not there

And I am saying, Your Honors, that it was, in fact,

19
20

made and that it was conceded and that either it was weighed —

21

and I ara saying that Your Honors have a perfect right to say -—Q

22

I don't agree that this is just a question of

<uo-

standing.

24

question of controversy.

<**}o

25

I think this is a question of whether you have got a

A

That is correct, Your Honor, but that is
30

1

Q

That is my problem.

2

A

We are using the case of whether there is a

3

sufficient case of controversy —»

4

Q

And that is declaratory judgment.

S

A

I am only using standing as a shorthand method

Q

Well# what about your fifth class# the class of

s

of saying.

7
8

all these people that haven't participated in anything yet?
A

9

They were chilled and their First Amendment rights

10

were ~~ well# when you do this# Your Honor — let's back up and

11

say there is a distinct difference that this Court has' recognised

12

in this particular area, between cases that deal with First Amend­

13
14

ment freedoms and all other classes of cases.
for that is quite important.

If we don't have an affective and quick method to

Well# what difference has this group you mentioned?

21

A

Well# they might be put in — you might even say

18

this suit.

22

they came in under pending jurisdiction.

We had a substantial

23

controversy between the first five groups# the people who ware

24

arrested.

25

controversy going on at fcfe time between the mass arrest situation

There is no question that there was a substantial

31

1

and the City of Chicago»

2

Mow out of that controversy as a result of what was

a

i
happening to the people that were arrested, in our humble opinio»,

4

there were people who were standing on the sidelines who might

S

have wanted to picket, who were not picketing, because they

©

thought, "Look at what is happening to these people who are in

7

that picket line.

8

are being arrested, and they are being kept in jail.

9

should I go out there and picket peacefully and go to jail for

two weeks before X can even post bond?"
Mow it is these people I think this Court should addre­ss

11
12

itself to because it is these people who then, after seeing the

n

effects of the other people who are the activists, stand silent

14

and stand moot, and that is the danger to order and liberty»

15

that is the same reason that this Court has made a distinction

16

between First Amendment, cases and all other cases,
Q

17
18

i

What is there in this record that tells us that

people should get beat over the head?

In this record now.

Well, Your Honor, X was speaking fast and it came

It will be more helpful to the Court, Mr. Reid,

2

if you keep your factual development within the record, so

3

that we know that you are talking about this case and not some

4

other hypothetical case.

S

A

In this particular case there were four or five

S

groups arrested and we picked some of the people out of these

7

groups as representative of the class.

9

arrested but who wanted to speak up and use speech in a lawful

Mow I am saying to the Court --

Q

13

people in this class had been arrested at some time?

Yaa, and in the appendix, starting at page 4,

paragraph 8 --•=■

Well, is that an allegation of complaint or is

it evidence?

No, paragraph 8 was admitted, that's right.

explain the answer.
Q

Well, I don't want to hold you up now.

But in any event there was no question about rt^

about- who the subclasses were.
33

Q

1

There is one thing in your off-the-record discus-

a

sion that doesn't seem to me to be pertinent.

3

this statute had been repealed by the Legislature and you didn’t

4

know whether it had been signed0

5

this would moot the case,

You said that

And if it had been signed,

6

A

The .bill has been vetoed,

7

Q

And the Court is entitled to know it,

a

A

The bill has been vetoed,

9

I just got a note from

Mr, Bilfcon two minutes ago,
Now, so it is not moot.

10

The only thing that I am

ii

saying is that when you look at whether or not there is a case

12

in controversy, I think you have to relax your standard as far

13

as First Amendment cases are concerned, because this Court has

14

said

15

really deal so much with the people that want to break the law.

IS

There are statutes on the books that are available to

17

give these people their just desserts and put them in jail com­

18

19

and I think we can’t gloss over this -- that we are not

mensurate with the crime that they have perpetrated in their
actions.

But when you back up a step and say that when you use

ARGUMENT OF ELLIS E. REID, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

(resumed)

7

MR. REID;

Thank you, Your Honor.

a

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please the Court:

0

I would like to at this point just address and point o at

10

that the problem that I think was bothering this particular

11

Court is that I have a feeling that you have a fear of being

iz

intimidated by this type of a case if you relax the standing

13

required in a declaratory judgment action to the degree that we

14

feel is necessary in order to protect First Amendment freedoms.

15

But I would like to say two things and try to make

16

this clear to the Court so that you understand it really from

17

a practicing lawyer's point of view, one who is concerned with

18

First Amendment freedoms.

19

First of all, I would like to say to you what I feel

20

would have happened had the state in this particular proceeding

21

won the race to the courthouse.

22

circles that this is a so-called race to the courthouse, whether

23

or not the state will file the charge or whether we will get to

24

the court and ask for a declaratory judgment on these over-broad

25

statutes in Federal forum,,
36

Now it has been called in many

1 would like to say, first of all, that just frora the

1

2

lawyer8s point of view had the state in this particular proceed­

3

ing won the race to the courthouse * in addition to the conflicts

4

legal and factual issues that I have had to address myself to

5

here over the last three years, I would have then had to deal

6

with another form,, also the issue of hail, the issue of defense

7

in a criminal case, the issue of being prepared to try a case if

8

it was not enjoined, and also the anti-injunction statute in the

9

Federal system,,
Q

10

n

Well, isn't that the normal course of litigation

in the general scheme of things?
A

12

What I am saying is that it doesn’t have to be

13

for the future.

14

Court is trying to address itself to that problem, because in

15

Bumbrowski and in Zwickler this Court said that it would be

16

enough to have a. threat arrest under the proper factual circum­

17
18
19
20

We have a. problem here and I think that the

stances and I detect from not only the questions today, but the
previous time that I argued this case, that this Court is also
dealing in

its own mind with the floodgate problem, and that is

whether or

not you would be inundated with this type of litiga­

21

tion if we.are -able to sit back in our office and go

22

23

statute, we will file suit on the bad statute and come to court.

24
25

to the

and say, that is a good statute, that is a bad

I don't think it is going to happen that way, because
these cases are expensive, these cases are very tedious and they

37

take, as you on see in this case, three to four years of a law­
2

yer’s time,

And that is one issue»

3

But, on the other hand, if the state wins the race to

4

the courthouse and is a threat and we have to wait, even though

S

they are threatening us like today to file suit tomorrow and wa

6

have to wait until tomorrow until suit is actually filed, then

7

in addition to the comp 1 fir problems in this type of case , in thi 3

8

Federal forum, I am also put to the task of dealing with the

©

complex legal and factual issues in the state court»
So I am saying, Your Honors,, that the floodgate argu­

10
It

ment that might be thrust upon you today will be found to be

12

wanting in this particular type of case, because it is a very

13
14
15
16

17
18

burdensome type of litigation and, No» 1, you must get one judge
of a district court to hear your case, look at your complaint
and to decide whether or not in his discretion he will convene
a three-judge court, as was done in this case, and motions for
dismissal of your complaint may be filed, as they were filed in
this case.
I would like to point out that these issues were met

19
20

head-on on a motion to dismiss filed in this particular case' and

21

I would like to, in the time that I have remaining, address

22

myself to four portions of the appendix which I think are importin'

23

to four specific portion of three-judge court's opinion.
Now, at page 57 of the appendix the court said as

24

25

follows;

"Plaintiffs filed their complaint on October 27, 1967,

38

1

Simultaneously they moved that a three-judge court be convened

2

to hear and determine the issues presented therein.

o«•>

thereafter both the state and the city defendants moved to

4

dismiss, contending inter alia, that the complaint failed to

S

disclose a basis for an equitable relief and the doctrine of

6

Federal abstention should be utilized to allow the state court

7

an opportunity to adjudicate the stats9s issues presented in its

8

complaint."

Shortly

An opinion dealing with these motions was issued on

9
10

December 28, 1967.

The defendants6 motions to dismiss were

Now, at page 62 of the same opinion — of the appen­
