ARGUMENT OF PETER E. SITKIN, ESQ,

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

6
7

MR. SITKIN;

io

May it please the Court, my name is

Peter E. Sitkin.

8
9

The first case is No, 14,

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr, Sitkin, you may pro­

ceed.
MR. SITKIN;

This case involves the question of what,

If

procedural rights are to be afforded the most dependent members

12

of our society -- the aged, the disabled, the blind, and the

13

children of the poor.

14

The basic issue presented by this case is whether

15

welfare recipients, after being found eligible, after full and

16

vigorous investigation, are to have their benefits terminated

17

without an opportunity for a full and fair adjudicative hee-ring,

18

In California at the present time, there is a hearing

19

which comports with the requirements of due process- after the

20

termination of welfare benefits.

21

by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, this hear­

22

ing should take place within 60 days from the date of termination

23

of benefits.

24

after that SO-day period, as has been conceded by appellees

25

in this case.

-

Under the regulations adopted

In point of fact, the hearing takes place long

2

1

Q

Is this a federally funded program?

2

A

Yas, it is.

The appellants who I am represent­

3

ing specifically are old age security recipients who are recipi­

4

ents under the categorical aid program funded by the Social

5

Security Act.

6
7

The regulation at issue in this case concerns all of
the categorical aid programs, that is, the aid to families with
i

8

dependent children, aid to the blind, aid to the disabled, as

9

wall as old age security.

10

Prior to termination of benefits, a welfare recipient

11

is not afforded an adjucative hearing to contest the reasons

12

upon which the department has based its decision to terminate.

13

A welfare recipient is only provided with an opportunity to

14

confer informally, usually with the very individual who has

15

made the initial decision to terminate, at a conference which

16

can take place at a minimum of three days before a check will

17

be terminated or a check will be withheld.

18

There is no opportunity within this short period of

19

time to adequately prepare for this conference? nor is there an

20

opportunity at the conference to have an opportunity to fairly

21

22
23
24
23

and fully adjudicate the questions which might involve continu­
ing eligibility, questions, for example, such as whether an
individual has intended to transfer property to remain on public
assistance, questions which have been traditionally decided in
adjudicative hearings with the procedural preceptions usually
3

i

connected with such hearings.

z

Q

Mr. Sitkin,

.you have said that a parson becomes

3

eligible after a full investigation.

4

That is not a trial-type hearing, is it?

5

old age assistance.

6

is found to be eligible, is there?
A

7
8

What is the procedure?
A person applies for

There is no trial-type hearing before he

No, there is no trial-type hearing prior to

eligibility.

9

Q

What is the procedure?

10

A

An individual applies to the Welfare Department

11

and information is provided by that individual.

The regulation.*;

12

of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare indicate

13

that the recipient himself is to foe the primary source of the

14

information regarding his eligibility.
The Department obtains consents from the individual

IS
16

and, if necessary, investigates the individual's eligibility

17

by contacting collateral sources with respect to the income that]

18

the individual might have, or with respect to other particulars

19

that concern his eligibility.
Q

20

2!

cross-examination, and that sort of thing.
A

22
23
24
25

But it is .not an open hearing with confrontation,

Not for an individual who is applying for assis­

tance .
The issue before this Court is whether or not an
individual who has already been found eligible prior to the
4

i

z

withholding of those benefits should be afforded an opportunity,
Q

I understand what the issue is.

1 am only talk­

3

ing about the process by which somebody already eligible becomes

4

ineligible.

S

A

Right.

©

Q

My question was directed to how he became eligibl a

1

in the first place.

3

like a trial-type hearing.

9

A

That is, as I understand it, not anything

There is no hearing.

There is a full investi­

10

gation, though, with respect to the individual.

'ii

that as an individual remains on public assistance, he is

12

periodically reinvestigated and required to provide the depart­

13

ment with information to maintain his eligibility.

14

Q

Who determines

15

A

Initially?

16

Q

Yes.

1?

A

The CountyWelfare

the eligibility?

Department.

In California,

!8

the welfare programs are administered locally by County Welfare

19

Departments, although the overall supervision rests with the

20

State Department of Social Welfare.

25

County Welfare Department, usually in the person of the social

22

worker or the social work supervisor, who initially approves the

23

application for eligibility.

24
25

But it is the individual

If there is a dispute with respect to eligibility,
the individual is afforded an opportunity for a hearing to
5

i

contest the reasons why the department has refused to grant

2

assistance in the first instance.

3

Q

Is that a trial-type hearing?

4

A

Yes* that is a trial-type hearing.

5

Q

Is it your contention that once a person has hem.

6

declared eligible by these county authorities* that he cannot

1

cut off without depriving him of a constitutional privilege?
!

8
9

A

Yes* it is our position that once a person is

found eligible for public assistance* if he is not afforded an

10

opportunity to b@ heard with respect to the reasons for dis­

i?

continuance* then his rights under the due process clause would

12

be violated* since h© is not being afforded a fair opportunity

13

to contest, the very reasons upon which the governmental agency

14

has made its decision to terminate benefits.
/

Q

And there never was any contest of that originally.

of the eligibility?
A

At the time that the .individual applied for aid,

he did meet the qualifications.

19

Q

20

trial-type procedure?

21

A

Well* there would be no need —

22

Q

Was there any trial-type procedure when he was

23
24
2S

He met the qualifications* but was there any

first declared eligible?
A

There would only have been a trial-type pro­

cedure if the Welfare Department had initially found the
6

1

individual to be ineligible and then he took an appeal from that

2

initial determination.

3

Q

4

type procedure in these cases?

5
6

Is your answer, then, that there was no trial-

A

There is no trial-type procedure when an indivi­

dual applies for welfare.

7

Q

He is declared eligible without any trial-typa

8

procedure, and your argument i.s that it is unconstitutional

9

to cut him off without a trial-type procedure.

10

A

11

Unless an individual is able to convince the very

That is our position.

12

individual who made the initial determination that a person is

13

ineligible, unless he is able to convince that person at this

14

informal conference held, as I mentioned, three days prior to

15

the date that a check will be held, he has no opportunity to

16

have his aid continue until the State administrative hearing

17

is provided at least. 60 days after the termination of his bene­

!8

fits .

19

In determining the extent to which procedural pro­

20

tection should be afforded a welfare recipient, this Court on

21

numerous occasions has indicated one must examine the system

22

in which the procedural protections will operate, examine the

23

interests of the individual concerned, and examine the interests

24

of the State or th© governmental agency involved.

25

The one overwhelming and unique factor which is
7

1

present in the welfare programs, which is present in no other

2

Government program, is that maintenance of the welfare grant

8

is the difference between survival, between starvation and con­

4

tinuation of soma type of sustenance.

S

interest on the part of the individual that we assert must be

6

protected by those procedures which this Court has considered

7

to be appropriate in adjudicative hearings — protections such

!

8

as the right to cross-examine and confront, where appropriate;

;

9

the opportunity to have a decision made by at least a relatively

10

impartial arbiter, not the very individual who made the initial

11

determination to withhold benefits? that an individual be

12

afforded a reasonable opportunity to prepare for a hearing, a

13

hearing which might, in many instances, involve the preparation

14

of some documentation

It is this fundamental

For example, in the case of Mrs. wheeler, the appellar t

21

tance, first, of a lay representative, and ultimately of an

This would take some time.

If she

Mrs. Wheeler was 77 years of

attorney,
Q

23

The real issue between you and your adversary,

24

unless I am mistaken, is when this hearing need be given, isn't

25

it?
8

1

A

That is the basic issue in the case»

2

Q

Because a heading of the kind and quality that

3

you are talking about is ultimately given under the law, isn't

4

it, a so-called "fair hearing»6’

5

A

Yes, it is.

The hearing is ultimately given,

6

but it is our contention that given the injuries that occur to

7

an individual when benefits are withdrawn» that in those rela­

8

tively few casas ~ and

9

tively few cases where the question of eligibility is contested,

have underscored that —- in the rela- ;

10

an individual should be given an opportunity to have this type

1!

of hearing prior to the withdrawal of benefits.

12

We are not talking about a hearing procedure which

3

is going to be available for all

4

in California, nor the 23,000 old age security recipients who

5

have been discontinued from assistance, for the figures bear out

6

that, is is a relatively few number of welfare recipients that

7

appeal the determination of the Welfare Department,.

8
9

million welfare recipients

In many instances there is agreement.

An individual

obtains employment, and is no longer eligible for assistance.

20

His income now exceeds the welfare limitations.

21

stance, an individual may have remarried and may no longer be in

22

need of additional public assistance.

23

about those situations where serious questions of fact have

24

arisen between the welfare recipient and the County Welfare

25

Department.
9

In another in­

So we are only concerned

1
2
3

It is to that issue that we assert an adjudicative
hearing having basic protections is necessary,
Q

Mr, Sitkin, suppose California said after this

4

3-day hearing * we will continue, but if you don0fc successfully

5

meet the appeal procedure within 60 days, you are out.

6

A

If that administrative decision was made by the

1

State of California, that would be satisfactory to the appel­

8

lants in this case.

9
10
11
12

13

Q

The real problem about —

To make it finer, your real criticism is the

cut-off of the money for two months.
A

Yes.

If, in fact, California was adhering to

the 60-day requirement —
Q

Suppose California said you lose in the first

14

instance and you win in the second instance, and so we give you

15

the two months if you win.

16

A

You are saying if we lose in the first instance

17

and we win in the second instance, and then we get retroactive

J8

benefits, that is not sufficient to fully make whole, if you

19
20

will, ..the individuals who were terminated from assistance»
As this Court has noted in a case decided last term',
-■i

'*

21

Nash versus the Florida Industrial Welfare Commission, the fact

22

that an individual ultimately can recoup- through retroactive

23

payments is not a satisfactory answer when the funds are•neces­

24
23

sary to provide the difference between continuing subsistence
and possible starvation.

10

!

Q

What is the case you are referring to?

2

A

The case was a case in Florida where an indivi­

3

dual was, under Florida law,

precluded —

Nash versus Florida Industrial Welfare Commission
What

is the citation?

The citation to the case is 389 U,S, 235.

In addition, if the Court would review particularly

11

the affidavit of Henry Frasier which is contained in the record ■

12

not in the appendix — in the record at pages 137 through 140,

13

the Court will graphically appreciate the circumstances

14

individuals are placed in when benefits are withheld even for a

IS

16
17
18

23

24
25

that

period of 60 days.
In the situation of a number of the intervenors in
this case, the individuals were reduced to a diet of potatoes,
to not having the ability to purchase any type of clothing is a
severe injury.

But it must be made plain that in California at

the present time, not even fcha SO-day requirement is being met.
One would assume, however, that if the hearing preceded termi­
nation, that the 60-day requirement would be met? indeed, the
experience in a number of States who have instituted a continua­
tion pending the hearing has resulted in a situation where
hearing decisions are rendered within two weeks.

11

1

So when there is the additional interest on the part

2

of the State both to rapidly adjudicate the decisions so that

3

additional monies are not paid out — in some instances to poter

4

tially ineligible persons — the hearings are held expeditiously

5

and rapidly, this flexibility is available within the admin­

6

istrative agencies involved, -.and the individual,

7

can be afforded those rights which are traditionally associated

8
9

Q

May I ask you;

Suppose a pension has been

granted to a recipient, or whatever you call it, and the Congresjs

10

or the Legislature wants to repeal it.

n

the Constitution forbids it?

12

the recipient

A

Is it your position that

No, it is not our position.

Our position is that

13

an individual does not have -- we use the term — a "vested

U

right" to the benefits which he is receiving.

15

terise that interest, it is a substantial one and it is an in­

16

terest which should not be taken from the individual without

17
18
19
20

However we charac­

according that individual basic elements of procedural fairness
and due process.
Q

Has that question ever bean tested with refer­

ence to any of the. pensions, Revolutionary pensions, Civil War

21

pensions, Spanish American pensions, or the First and Second

22

World War Pensions?

23

24
25

A

I don*t believe that the specific issue before

this Court in this case has bean tested with respect to the
procedural rights that arc) to be afforded individuals, but there
12

2

have been cases that have been, decided by this Court that have

Z

indicated that however one characterizes the interest, that

3

Government must act in a fair and reasonable way in the admin­

4

istration of programs where basic interests are involved» whefchc r

5

one characterises it as a .right, as a vested right, or as a

6

privilege.
Q

7

Well, would it be your position that a pension

8

cannot be cut off where it has once been decided that a man gets

9

a pension without giving him some kind of hearing before it is

10

cut off?
A

II

To answer that question directly, one would have

12

to be aware of the circumstances under which the pension was

13

granted —

14
15
16

Q

Just a pension; just granted because he was in

the Amy, unless the Government doesn* i have to'grant it.
A

The Government doesn't have to grant it in the

17

first instance, but once it does grant it, and assuming that, the

18

legislation remains in effect, then the individual should be

19

entitled to continue to receive that pension unless there is a.

20

determination which is reached, after a reasonable opportunity

21

to adjudicate the matter, that the individual is no longer

22

eligible for a pension.

23

Q

You are not suggesting that the legislature would

24

have to consult with anyone if the legislature decided to repeal

25

the entire program, are you?

13

I

A

Mo, not at all.

I am not suggesting at all that

2

the legislature does not have within its power the right to

3

withdraw any government benefit program *

4

or not, once the legislation has been passed, and once benefits

5

are being provided to individuals, before a specific indivi-

6

dual’s welfare assistance is removed, he should be afforded thosjs

7

opportunities which have been afforded individuals in like cir­

8

cumstances by this Court.
Q

9

The issue is whether

In regard to employment termination, if you are

10

working for the Federal Government, do you, .have a constitutional

11

right not to b© terminated before there has been a trial-type

12

hearing?
A

13

It is ray position that you do have a right to hava

U

a hearing which has the basic elements of due process before

15

termination.

16

Q

What has this Court said about that?

17

A

This Court, in the case of Greene versus McElroy,

18

which admittedly was not a constitutional decision, but spoke in

19

constitutional terms, indicated that basic procedural protections

20

are indeed essential before the right to public employment is

21

withdrawn.

22
23
24
25

Q

In cafeteria workers, that was not made quite as

rigid, was it?
A

Ho, in cafeteria workers it was not mcid® as rigid

but the Court clearly indicated that due process applied and tha

14

t

the analysis that X suggested earlier should be undertaken.

2

that case, it was felt that the interest of the Government in

3

national security, and the fact that the interest of the indivi­

4

dual involved in that case was not so substantial that pro­

5

cedural safeguards of the type we are seeking here should be

6

afforded.

In

In that case, the individual was only stopped from

7

8

working at one particular base.

9

situation is the withdrawal of the very means of subsistence to

10

What we have in this particular

an individual.
Q

11

Do you mean that the pay of a Federal employee

12

may not be stopped pending a hearing; before he can be sus­

13

pended from the job and his pay stopped,

14

type hearing?
A

15

there must be a

trial

You say this Court has held that?
This Court has held in cases where there has

16

not been the overriding interest of national security that a

17

public employee does have an opportunity to be afforded an

18

opportunity to be heard —

19

Q

Before his pay is stopped?

20

A

Before his wages are taken.

21

G

In what case did the Court hold that?

22

A

As I indicated, in the case of Greene versus

Q

That didn’t deal, did it, with the question of

23
24
25

McElroy.

when the pay could be stopped in relation to the time of the
15

1

hearing?

2

status and his pay was stopped»

3

was given at a later date.

4

he got back pay retroactive to the date of the suspension.

5

If I recall it correctly, McElroy was put on suspended
Such hearing as he was given

When he was ultimately reinstated,

It seems to ms that is the point to which Mr. Justice

6

White is addressing himself, and I am not sure you have answered

7

it.

8
9

A

In the case of Sloucher versus the City of New

York, where an individual had bean working for the City of New

10

York, the individual in that particular case was afforded an

11

opportunity to be heard before his wages were withdrawn.

12
13

Q

Did the Court hold that the State had to do that,

to afford such a hearing?

14

A

I believe so,

15

Q

Well, let’s assume, for example, that there is

16

no requirement, constitutional requirement, for a trial-type

17

hearing before termination of employment, at least before ter­

18

mination of a man's pay, although he may have ultimately a

19

right to a trial-type hearing.

20

the welfare recipient is entitled to a trial-type hearing prior

21

to termination of benefits?

22
23

A

Would you say that, nevertheless,

I would say that the welfare recipient is en­

titled to such a hearing.

24

Q

Regardless of what the employee is entitled to.

25

A

Regardless of what the employee is entitled to.
16

1

because, again, the individual who is on public assistance

2

really is receiving the last public defense*

3

Q

X would like to be absolutely clear about this

4

part of your argument»

3

or a State enacts a gratuity piece of legislation, giving some”

6

body something out of the treasury, and declaras that they shoul I

7

be found eligible by certain agencies, that they can never be

8

declared ineligible without going through a type of trial pro-

Is it your position that when Congress

V

9
10

cedure?
A

Not at all.

Our position is that an individual

11

can be. found initially ineligible by the Welfare Department,

12

but he must be notified of that fact, and if ha contests that

13

determination, then he should be entitled to a hearing which

14

affords him basic procedural safeguards since such a vital in­

15

terest is involved.

16
17
18

Q

Maybe my question was right»

I don’t quite under

stand your answer.
Is it your position that when there is a gratuity

19

given, such as has been given in many wars, after many wars,

20

bread, meat, gratuities of various kinds, somebody is found

21

eligible by an agency, that the Government cannot deprive that

22

person of that gratuity thereafter without going through a trial

23

type procedure?

24
25

A

If there is an individual dispute regarding eli­

gibility, then the individual should be afforded a hearing.

17

The

1

problem I have with the question is the term "trial-type"»

2

am not asking for a hearing which has all of the —

3
A

Q

I

1 understand you to say they have to have notice

before they cut it out.

5

A

Yes? right.

6

Q

Now, after the Civil War there were large numbers

7

of gratuities given in this country of food and meat and raiment

8

of various kinds.

But due to the terrific increase in fair hearing re­

12

quests, from 500 normal requests a month to 700 now, in July

13

August, and September, they felt that they should try to meet

14

the 60-day requirement, try to meet the State regulation that

the hearing must be held within 17 days of the request for the

hearing, and not bother, because they have not had a comm.ensu.rat

Consequently, they have also adapted the position that

going to be the referee’s decision.

That decision goes out

immediately, and less harm to the recipient whose hearing deci­

11

Is there anything in this record, Mrs. Palmer,

12

about what success the State of California has had in recouping

13

payments improperly made to recipients who were determined not

14

to be eligible?
A

15

No, I don't know of any statistics, Your Honor.

IS

I understand that it is not too successful.

California does

17

not take liens on property, as some other States do.
I must also — and I am sorry I forgot to bring to

18

19

the Court’s attention — that in California, one of the peculiar-'

A

It depends upon the circumstances, 'Your Honor.

There are cases that hold that —
Q

Well, is if your idea of due process that the

person making the .charges should arbitrate it?
A

The California Supreme Court has held in Griggs

against Board of Education that when •—
Q

I am merely saying that the procedure that California

It is indefensible.

has adopted does satisfy, at this stage of the proceeding, clue
process.
Q

Mrs. Palmer, does the Federal law permit a State

to terminate benefits pending a full trial-type hearing?
A

Yes, Your Honor, they do.

Q

Although the Federal law requires a fair hearing.

A

Requires the fair hearing and —*

Q

It is enough to satisfy the Federal law if you

grant the fair hearing after the termination of benefits?
31

1

A

z

Q

That is correct, Your Honor»
But at the same time , I suppose the Federal law

3

would continue to support the State program if the Stata did not

4

terminate pending the fair hearing?
A

5

6

That is true, Your Honor,

The option is there

for the State.
Q

7

If California wanted to, after the informal con­

8

ference where termination was decided on, continue benefits pend­

9

ing a full trial-type hearing, the Federal Government would con­

10

tribute?

11

A

That is correct.

12

Q

But also, if California doesn't want to do that,

13

which it doesn't --

14

A

That is the option of the Stata.

15

G

So under the Federal statute, the Federal authori­

16

ties construe the fair hearing provision, I take it, to be

17

satisfied by California's system.

18
19
20

A

Yes, that is correct, Your Honor.

And the brief

of the Solicitor General confirms that,
Q

Mrs. Palmer, as I understand it, the State posi­

21

tion is that what is now provided before actual termination

22

satisfies due process.

23

A

Yes, Your Honor.

G

And do I understand that implicit in that is a

24
25

concession that constitutionally something in the way of due
32

1

process must be afforded before there may be a termination?
A

2

Yes, Your Honor.

That was admitted at the very

3

early stages and that is why the appellee promulgated these

4

regulations to strengthen the procedure.
Q

S

That being so, I gather that the issue for us,

6

if that concession states constitutionally the requirement, is

7

simply whether what you do provide does satisfy the constitu­

8

tional requirement.
A

9
10

That is the conflict, really.

Do we satisfy due

process with the procedure that we have?
May I point out to the Court that in many instances

11
12

Court judgments are based on just affidavits —- prelirainary

13

injunctions, temporary restraining orders, arrest warrants, and

14

so on -— on just affidavits, and this is more than just affi­

15

davits .

16

Q

Mrs. Palmer, do I draw that if the recipient says

17

"I need more than these three days to get these affidavits," they

18

would give him that extra time?

19

A

I canst answer that, Your Honor.

Q

I suppose that would vary.

It would vary.
