MR. WALLACE:

Food and Drug Laws.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This is a criminal prosecution under the Federal

j

Respondent and Detroit Vital Foods,

10

Incorporated, the corporation of which they were officers,

n

were convicted after a jury ferial on five counts of an indict­

12

ment charging them with misbranding of drugs.

13

The corporation is not before this Court in the

14

present petition.

The sentences imposed by the District Court '

15

are summarized on our brief on Pages 2 and 3.

The evidence showed that Respondent Kordel was

ailments could be alleviated by the consumption of certain

foods and food elements and that the best sources of these

24

products were sold in booths in or near the lecture halls and

25

were also available in health food stores, generally.

20

to the public.

2

Respondent Feldten acted as KordeX's assistant,

1

2

selling products at the lectures and taking orders for ship­

3

ments from Dsteroit«.

i

The criminal charges were that as to some of the

4
5

products certain of the books andleaflets constituted part of

6

the labeling and contained false and misleading statements

7

and as to all of the counts cm which respondents were con­

8

victed, the product which they claimed to be merely food

9

supplements, were in fact, drugs.

Because they were intended

10

by the Defendants to be used for the prevention and treatment

11

of various diseases and health conditions and that the label- j

The parties then served interrogatories upon each

The Government’s interrogatories were served in January and

tion of certain of the products and about Kbrdel' a oral

representation concerning the efficacy of these products that j
were made during public lectures that he made in, Detroit.
In late January? 1961 shortly after service of the.

Government's initial interrogatories, tbs corporation received]

14

a notice from the Government? pursuant to Section 335 of the

IS

Act? indicating that criminal prosecution of the corporation

m

and of the Respondents was contemplated in part? for the same

17
18

conduct that was the subject for the libel.

The District Court denied this motion in June? 19C1
holding.that there was no certainty when or whether a criminal
.prosecution would be brought and that there was no prejudice
in requiring the corporation to answer the interrogatories

1

since the same information would otherwise become available

2

to the Government in any event, from the trial of the libel

proceeding.

Pursuant to tie Court * s order the corporation then

5

filed answers to some of the interrogatories in September,

the Food and Drug Administration ice ferred the matter to the

20

Department of Justice with a recommendation for criminal

2«

prosecution.

j

The indictment was returned in August, 1963.

22

In March, 1965 the defendants in the criminal case

23

moved t© suppress any evidence obtained by the Government as

24

a result of the corporations answers to the interrogatories

25

in the libel proceeding or in the alternative for a hearing to;

5

2

determine the Government's motive in bringing the civil action

2

and serving the interrogatories.
The District Court granted the alternative reguest

3
4

for a hearing which lasted three days *

S

hearing set forth in the Appendix from Pages 53 to 290 showed

6

that at the time the civil case was filed the Food and Drag

7

Administration already had evidence, sufficient in its judg­

8

ment to establish all the elements of the criminal violation

but. had not-

The agency determined that the in rent seizure pro­

12

ceeding should be commenced promptly in ordered to prevent

13

harm to the public from continued distribution of the mis-

14

branded drugs and that the interrogatories were designed sole!;- ’

15

for the purposes of the civil suit and were submitted, as they

16

are, routinely in such suits in an effort to narrow the issues

17

for trial and in the hope of laying the foundation for a

18

motion of summary judgment, possibly inducing the corporation

19

to agree "with consent decree by demonstrating the insubstan­

20

tial! ty of its case, which is what eventually happened.

21

The District Court held on the basis of this hearing

22

that the Governmental decisions to commence the civil suit and

23

tc serve the interrogatories were made in good faith and not

24

for the purpose of proeuringevidence for a criminal prosecu­

25

And a conviction followed.

In its initial opinion the Court of Appeals also

14
15

reversed the corporation’s conviction but on the government’s

16

petition for rehearing it modified its opinion in judgment so

17

as to affirm that conviction on the ground that the privilege

18

against self-incrimination is available under this Court’s

19

decision only to natural persons and not to a corporation.

A petition for certiorari by the corporation was

We contend, first, that the Court of Appeals erred

24

in holding the Respondents * privilege against self-incrimina­

tion had been violated.

Neither of the respondents had

7

'1

interposed any claim to the seised drugs nor did either of the

2

them have a personal property interest in the drugs.

3

was a party to the civil action; neither of them was obligated

4

or required to answer any of the interrogatories served on the

corporation proceeding, and indeed, Respondent KorcleX supplied

no answers and Respondent Feldten, who aid submit answers on

behalf of the corporation, stated therein that the truth of

the answers was not known to him personally.

So, the answers {

did not constitute admission on his part.

j

10

And finally, neither Respondent in any way claimed

]

11

tht his privilege was being violated when Respondent Feldten

j

12

submitted the answers on behalf of the corporation.,

i

|

The explicit language of Rule 33 dealing with inter-!

13

j

14

rogatories and the decisions implementing the rule, made clear

15

that when a corporation is the party served with interrogator-j

18

ies, the corporation is obligated to appoint an agent who,

17

without fear of self-incrimination can furnish such requested j

18

information as is available to the corporation.

20

it.

It is compulsion ofthe corporation which had

no privilege; not of the Respondents and officers or share­

overrule Campbell Painting Corporation against Reid in Vol.

21

That is the meaning of this Court’s decision and it

22

the contrary.

To hold otherwise would be to

It would be a departure from the holding that

Would there be, in your view, a violation of

the Fifth Amendment if these people had not been doing business

thing happened?

Well, they certainly could have claimed a

14

privilege against self-incrimination as individuals, even
15

though they were doing business as a partnership.

Q

1

Even then to be compulsive wouldn't, it have

2

to be that the forfeiture would occur as a result of the

3

failure to answer the interrogatories, rather than the strengh

4

of the government's case in the civil suit?
A

5

Well*, that is true? there might be some

6

question as to whether, the mere failure to answerthe inter­

7

rogatories and the possible sanctions

Well, that is not automatic at all*

That

isn't automatic at all, -that you lose your suit because you
refuse to answer.
A

n

Xtccertainly is not, especially i.f you have

12

a well-founded claims of privilege as the basis for your

13

refusal.
Q

14

I suppose many civil casas have been lost

15

because of the disinclination of the defendant in the civil,

16

case to answer some question which might incriminate himself;

17

is that not. so?

A

18

\
To the best of my belief it is so.

But, as

I said

Q

The corporation was the claimant.

7

A

We have also addressed our brief to the

8
9
10

broader concern which seems tounderlie the decision at the
Court of Appeals: the question of fairness., in the administra™
in
fcion by government agencies/this and other fields of their
responsibilities under statutes which provide for the possi~

u
12
!3

bility of both civil and criminal remedies against offending
corporations? or individuals.
Our brief discussed the practices and experience wifi

14

several agencies and articulates some general criteria,which
15
has seemed to us to be suggested by the leading cases in this

17
m

20

?A
22
23
24

field;
to
And we also discuss the matter/which t would now
like to turn; our contention that there was no unfairness in
the administration of the Food and Drug Laws in this hearing.
There was in the first place, an important need to
protect the public from harm here, as is frequently true at
Food and Drug or in securities broad cases, for that matter.
at
By commencing the civil proceedings promptly, it was/the very
least, reasonable for the responsible officials to decide that

25
12

1

this protection of the public should not await determination

2

of whether a criminal prosecution would :lso be appropriate,

3

let alone final disposition of any criminal proceeding that

4

might be instituted.

5

j

Moreover, it was important to proceed to judgment ini

S

the condemnation case because Congress has, for good reasons

7

referred to in our brief, provided in Section 334 fof theAAcfc

...... -V.

9
10

it can proceed by multiple seizures against additional quan.

11

titles of the drugs being marketed elsewhere.

12

The interrogatories served on the corporation were

13

found after a hearing to have designed in good faith for the

14

legitimate purpose of expediting civil suits and judgments.

13

The questions asked were relevant to the Issues in the civil

13

proceeding, even though the Court of Appeals seamed to believe

17

that some of them were not, apparently because it did not

18

appreciate the bearing of Respondent Kordel's oral represen­

19

tations at the public lectures on the theory of the Govern-

20

merit's civil case, which depended on proof of the uses for

21

which the product was being marketed by the corporation were

22

intended.

23

In their brief, Respondents suggest a lack of fair­

24

ness because the Gorernment could have utilized an alternative

25

procedure seeking interim injunctive relief instead of the

13

1
2
3
4

libel in rem.

But the same interrogatories would have been
in
equally relevant/establishing the governments case in an
injunctive proceeding.

6

Moreover# the judgment in an in rem proceeding pro"
1j
vides more effective protection of the public because it
i
enables the Government expeditiously to present further dis­

7

semination of the misbranded drugson anyone holding them for

8

sale.

S

A final indication of the Government's fairness in

9
10

this case is to be found in the fact that shortly after service

11

of the interrogatories and prioroto the corporation’s answer­

12

ing of them# the Government notified the corporation# pursuant

13

to Section 335 of the Act# that criminal prosecution of Res«

14

pendents and the corporation was being considered.

15

could not judge whether providing answers to the interrogator­

16

ies on behalf of the corporation might tend to incriminate:

17

them.

18

furnished set forth in the Appendix# suggests that this con­

IS

sideration did riot escape their attention.

25

Respondents

It is required by the statute: Section 335#

We do not rest# however# on a contention that, the
Government learned nothing from these answers and matters as to
14

1

which it is generally difficult to sustain a burden of proof

6,

such as the Court of appeals here employs.
Our position is that because the interrogatories

3
4

were used properly and fairly in a good,-faith civil suit, for

3

the legitimate purposes of that suit there is no more reason

'

6
7

for preventing the Government, from basing a criminal investi­
gation from information it learned thereby than there would.be

Q

for preventing it from basing an investigation on information

9

legitimately revealed in the course of any other good-faith

10

civil procedure, whether between private parties or similarly

11

involving the Government as a party.
.Exclusionary rules in their various connotations

12

have, after all, been held by this ‘"’ourt to be required only

18

that; if there had been a finding to that effect, then the

19

results would have been justified, although we can’t accept

the rationale that the violation was of the Fifth Amendment

I think that if the hearing had shown

Q

extraordinary example of unfair

Do you rely on any statutory prohibition

against what's called unfair?
A

YourHonor, yes, I do. I would rely upon the

McNabb doctrine that this Court and the Federal Courts have
supervision over the fair administration of criminal justice,
which as I understand, the Government's argument rises to the
level of a constitutional right of due process.
Q

Didn't the Court Below decide this on the

question of constitution?
A

It would appear that they decided the ques­

tion on two grounds, one of which they articulated out, I
more
believe,/specifically than the second ground,and the Solicitor
apparently agrees with that.

First on the Fifth Amendment and

secondly, because of some of the cases which they cited in
their statement of what -actually had occurred and the complete
and total comingling of a fcivil function and the criminal
investigation by the same individual at the same time, that
that somehow moved the Court to rely upon certain cases which
19

\)

1

they did rely upon to support the ultimate decision of

z

Q

3

or the other; or both?

4

A

Both, Your Honor; both, Mr. Justice Black.

5

Q

And your argument is that if something a

6

7

Are you relying on the constitutional point

Court thinks is unfair is prohibited by law?
A

I would say it’s violative of the constitu­

8

tional due process and also comes within the authority of

9

this Court to supervise the fair administration of justice

10

under the McNatob Rule.

12

How —

12

Q

While we .nave you stopped for a moment, Mr.

23

Friend, suppose you tried the civil case and in the civil

14

case, instead of eliciting these answers by discovery the

15

same questions were put to the individual officers here

IS

involved; would you have at that time a choice to decline to

17

answer on Fifth Amendment grounds?

18

A

Or answer as they did?

2 think, Your Honor, the answer to that

19

question is that at that point ‘there would have been a choice

20

which they could make,

22

been deemed to have waived.their privilege.-

22

if they had testified they would have

In.the instant case they sought relief in the form

23

of a protective order and then were ordered — that is to say,

as they would argue, the corporation, which happens to be the

25

20

i

the questions.

Well, how is that different from having a

< .

Q

Well, assuming — and against the background

of the Fifth Amendment problem.
A

MNo, Mr. Justice White. The cases go on the

17

broader theory that it is inherently unfair to either defendant

i8

in a civil case to try and get the Government’s evidence by

19

use of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure where there is

20

a threatened criminal ease or a pending criminal case and for

21

the Government to propose interrogatories to the defendant to

22

try to gat the defendant * s defense or evidence which will

23

support the prosecution.

24
25

I

And as a matter of fact, in the cases cited on our
brief — in our brief, under the anti-trust laws and as well as

21

1

under the Internal Revenue Service laws.

The case United

2

States against Linen Supply Institute of Greater New York, the

3

Government, had moved to extend its time and sought a protec­

4

tive order, just as we did, from being required to answer

S

interrogatories which had been propounded to it by the defen­

6

dant in the civil case.

7

which we make — at least one of the arguments which we make

a

here — namely that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure-

9

should not toe used by either side where there is a criminal

10

case pending so as to draw from the use of the Federal Rules

information that they would not be entitled to under the

Criminal Rules.

And argued the very same argument

13

Now, we don't say, and nor did the Court find ~~ in j

14

fact the Court of Appeals specifically held that the Governmenj

15

may bring a civil and a criminal case simultaneously if the

16

statute so provides.

that — to the extent that there may be discovery in a

Mr,, Justice White, the civil case was identical with
the counts in the criminal case.

assume that they had a criminal case going and they subpoenaed
the files of the corporation; not 'the files of the individual
defendant, but the files of the corporation,

1 suppose they

could get them; couldn’t they?
A

Well, 1 would agree with

Your Honor that

they could under the White case —
Q

Well, they were getting no more

putting the

!

1

Fifth Amendment aside,- they were getting no more by getting

2

corporate evidence than they could get in the criminal case.

3
4

A

Well, I most respectfully disagree with that

suggestion, Mr. Justice White, because ;even the D5.strict Court

5

found, and the Court of Appeals made express findings with

6

respect to this point that what they sought was not corporate

7

documents; that what -they sought was admissions concerning

Mr. Justice Black, when themotion for a

dilemma which confronted the two officers of the corporation.

NOW —-

Q

Let me ask you a question; Suppose the civil
25

1

case started; nc criminal case in contemplation or investiga­

2

tion, and the testimony in the trial onfche civil case satis­

3

fied the prosecutor that there was a criminal case which should

4

be made out and then he got an indictment after the disposi­

5

tion of the civil case, would you make these same claims?

6

A

I would not make that argument under those

7

facts, Your Honor, and I do not believe that those facts would

8

have moved the Court ofAppeals to reverse.

9

Q

Then does the constitutional question you are

10

arguing depend upon the motivation of the prosecutor in press­

ti

ing the civil case first?

12
13

14
55
1C5
17
18

19

20
21

A

Mr.. Chief Justice, I do not believe that a

pursuit of the motive of good faith or the lack of good faith
is a fruitful inquiry, for this reasons

In every case where

there is a criminal case pending or threatened that's parallel
to a civil case it can always be argued by the Government that
at least one of the motives in serving the interrogatories is
to lay the groundwork for summary judgment or narrow the issue;
an! indeed, the filing of the civil case under the Food and
Drag law is a relatively simple and commonplace function,
As a matter of fact, what happened in this case is
I

22
23
24

25

after they filed this civil case they did nothing to protect
the public interest, either by aninjunction *— and of course,
if they had all the evidence anyway which they say that had, t<bring a criminal case, they most certainly could have moved in

26

1

with a temporary restraining order to restMn shipment which

2

would have dried up the source of the materials, they wouldn't
multiple
have had to make/seizures =

3
4

Secondly,, they never made multiple seizures.

The

3

case was settled by a consent decree containing an exculpatory

6

clause which they admitted thatnothing within that civil case

7

would be deemed as an admission against, the premise ‘that they

3

violated the law.
Thens by using the interrogatories — the answers

9

10

for the interrogatories,, and I would like to talk about that

11

for a moment — by using the interrogatorias they accomplished

12

exactly that which they said would not be implied by the enteri a-:

13

■the consent decree, namely: an admission of guilt or evidence

14

or leads from/ evidence concerning guilt.

IS

Now —

16

Q

Mr. Friend3, may 2 just ask —-

suppose that

17

there had been no proceeding against the individuals, either

18

a civil case or in the criminal case.

19

each, the civil and the criminal case had been the corporation

20

only, would you be making this same argument?

21

22
23

But the defendant in

A

Your Honor, the corporation was the defendant

Q

I know it was, along with the individuals

involved.

24

But suppose it was the sole defendant in the civil case and

25

the sole defendant in the criminal case.

27

1

A

Sir, 1 would not make the argument on Fifth

2

Amendment grounds but X would make the argument under McNabb

3

or under reasonable and fair administrative procedures —

4

Q

And under the rules. X guess?

5

A

And under the rules?

6

Q

And you think P then, that the Court of

I think :iIt's Rule

7

Appeals was wrong, then in affirming the judgment against the

8

corporation?

A

9

The Court of Appeals — X do.

As a matter of

10

fact X have a petition for rehearing of denial of a petition

it

for certiorari as to the corporation which was filed in June

12

and which is still pending before the Court.

13

arguments we made on the petition for rehearing is that if

14

we’re right on this other point of unfairness.

15

if the Court of Appeals is sustained on grounds broader,

16

perhaps than what they specifically articulated

17

would justify a reversal of the Court of Appeals affirmance

18

in respect to the corporation.

19

than the Fifth Amendment.

Indeed, it goes to the point that

But did not this Court in the Boyd case,

15

emphasize with great, particularity that it was private papers,

16

the kind of

17

from a couple of hundred years before, "That man’s private

18

papers are amongst his dearest possessions."

19

that,

papers that were being seized and cited a British

Something like

20

Now, you don't have private papers here, do you?

21

A

Mr. Chief Justice, the case did deal with

22

private papers.

There was language in the Boyd case which the

23

District Judge in our case, who ruled against ns on this

24

motion for- suppress, by the way, suggests that the Boyd holding

25

is broader than the Fifth Amendment or private papers, in that
2 S'

1

it's basically unfair; it’s violative of the public policy

2

which is rooted — this is their language — "rooted in

3

historical and settled concepts of Anglo-Saxon criminal juris­

4

prudence that a defendant or prospective defendant should not

5

be required to disclose evidence to sustain the prosecution

6

against him in a criminal case or his evidence of defense".. And

7

in the Fair case and any number of cases that make the point •

8

that this is not a matter of Fifth Amendment.

9

the possible violation of a privilege of self-incrimination

It borders on

10

and that the issue is also whether the methods employed in

H

obtaining such information shows such offense that the evidence-

12

should be inadmissible, apart from Fifth Amendment considera­

13

tion.
Q

14

Now, in determining it on fairness, what I

15

am interested in is what’s my standard;what guides me if no

16

constitutional provision and no law?
A

17

Well, Mr. Justice Black, I think the standard,

13

here would be whan one views the facts, no different from what

19

the standard was inthe MCNafob case or the Rea case.

20

t>

What happened here, and I think this should be

21

stressed, is that the interrogatories were prepared by Mr.

22

Josh Randolph of the Food and Drug Administration at the same

23

time that he prepared a notice notifying the defendants — all

24

'the defeM&afc©, including the corporation, that their investi­

25

gation revealed defendant's responsibility for criminal

30

i

violations of the Act
Now, this notice is just that; if. didn't say we

2

3

have it under consideration.

It says, "our investigation"

4

— tills is on Page 1-A of our appendis in: our brief —

g

"Investigation by this administration indicates your* respon­

6

sibility for violation of the het"and then they spall out the

7

violations.

8

Now, the same individual who was investingating —

9

and this was Mr. Randolph's testimony — he was in charge of

10

the investigation in the criminal case and he was in charge

11

of preparing the interrogatories inthe civil case..
Q

!2
13

Did that notice get delivered before

interrogatories were answered?
A

14

The notice was sent out on December 29th;

15

they were received bn January the 15th„

16

were received on January the 9th.

17
18
19

20

The interrogatories

They were virtually simul­

taneous o
Q

Well, had the interrogatories been answered

by the 15th?
A

No, sir.

The interrogatories were answered

21

in September but — because the motion had been made in the

22

meantime to stay the answering of these interrogatories.

23

24
25

But

what happened was when he got the answers he then made a recom­
mendation — the second recommendation to indict the — that
the defendants be indicted and to refer the matter to the
31

1

Department of Justice,

2

This, within a matter of week or two.

But as the record shows, in discussing the matter

3

with the Food and Drug Administration official in Detroit —

4

Mr. Randolph being in Washington, he made ,it a point of

5

telling the FDA official in Detroit who was handling the civil

6

case on "the local scene to be sure to send him the answers

7

to the interrogatories and when he said he would, and did,

S

he then called Mr. Fowler in Detroit and told Mr,, Fowler that

9

he would like to send out another notice of criminal viola­

10

tion which is the fourth notice which was sent out, which*

11

now broadened fcfte first three — they actually sent three out

12

almost at the same time, but the fourth one was sent out after

13

they had the answers and a second recommendation was made to

14

indict these defendants.
Q

15

1 think 1 may have diverted jpu from respond­

16

ing to Mr. Justice Black's question about the standards that

17

he utilize.

It was

That was decided, was it not, under the

general Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and I should think,
in answer to Mr. Justice Black we are, of course, sworn, to
,

1?

uphold and enforce the constitution, but there are also mour

12

statutes and with particular reference to this case, there are

13

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure created, promulgated and laid

14

down by this Court and I suppose that they have soma relevance

15

too, and they are laid down for civil casea and the very

IS

specific standard which, it seems to me, you can zc

17

case is those Federal rules of civil procedure having to do

18

with interrogatories in pretrial discovery that are made for

19

civil cases explicitly"- the rules laid down by this Court —

20

and are not to be used or taken advantage of or for abuse and

21

wrong use in criminal cases.

22

.

And you don't need to refer to the Bible or morality
or anything else, you simply —

Q
which.rules.

I agree with ray brother about the rules.

But

3 have heard nothing from you about any rules.

1

Which rules sets up the standard of defense?

2

MR. JUSTICE STEWART;

3

MR. FRIEND:

Rule 33 and others.,

I thank you, Mr. Justice Stewart.

4

There are rules as I — now 1 understand the point.

5

rules in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which allows

8

certain forms of discovery.

There are

On the other hand, there are —

Q

Is there one which forbids what was done

I would say that the Federal Rule of Criminal

10

Procedure which incorporates 'the McNabfo Rule, and I believe it

11

is 41-B, into the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure —

12

Q

I never knew that before.

13

A

The rule I'm referring to, has the effect,

15

Mr. Justice Black, as I read -the rule, of granting the Court
criminal
authority to supervise the fair administration of/justice

16

and

14

17

Q

What is that?

18

A

I believe it's 41~B.

19

Q

That's' a search and seizure.

20

A

Your Honors, may I point out in that cormec»
\

21

tion of fairness, that in the instant case an official of the

22

Food and Drug Administration testified that it was the routine

23

practice over the past 38 years for the Food and Drug Adminis­

24

tration to file interrogatories and then take the answers to

23

those interrogatories and use them in the criminal case at the

35

1

very time that the r£o\ was considering a priminal case —
Q

2

.Didn't the constitution put a barrier up

3

which was a protection for all or the citizens in saying that

4

the question might not need to be one which is'bound to in­

5

criminate. you, but if it has a tendency to intimidate you yon

6

do not need to answer.

that protectioni’

Q

12

A

That's a protection. Now, they seek to deny

Q

How can you have a better protection than

us

10

u

You cann51 be forced to answer t isn' t

that?

An absolute right to refuse to answer.
A

Except, Mr. Chief Justice, that in this case

13

they would deny us that protection because they say, techni­

14

cally the interrogatories were directed to the corporation

13

which doesn't enjoy the privilege.

16

held, below that Kordel was the dominant personality; the

17

corporation was merely a device, an instrumentality to which

IB

he sold his products$ that the interrogatories were directed at

And we say and the Court

his activities.
20

21

22

And since they chose to get this information ©bout
him by asking the corporation the questions, in effect, since
they had reached the corporate veil in the questions that they

23

asked, they shouldn’t be permitted to repair that breach to

24

deny Kordel his Fifth Amendment privilege.

25

Q

. KFell, hadn’t he assented?

3?

And —

1

2

A

to your question —

3

,

That was, I believe, Your Honor, in answer

0

Had he asserted if?

4

him the privilege.

5

assert it?

6

A

You said they denied

And I"based that, on the question: Did he

He did 'riot assert it, but 1 think a more

7

complete answer, Your Honor, would be that he did not waive

8

it, either, because of the motion that was made at the time

9

to excuse him — excuse the corporation from being required to

10

11

answer the question.
How, what they say Kordel should have done: they

12

admit Kordel himself had -the Fifth Amendment privilege, and he

13

didn't have to answer*

14

their case — they say 'fchatth© corporation should have appoin­

15

ted a third party, some agent, to answer the questions and,

16

in effect what they're saying is, and of course*the corpora­

17

tion could act through a human being — they're saying that

18

Kordel, who himself had a privilege not to answer, should have

19

appointed an agent and then supplied him with the information

20

to answer 'the questions which he himself would have been

21

privileged to withhold.

22

But they say, and this is the crux of

And they go so far as to say that

there is an

23

agent available, why isn't the corporatiori the attorney, who

24

happens to be me, that what 2 should do is sign the answers to

25

the interrogatories on behalf of the corporation,

38

1

but the only way that 1 could get the information available

2

to the corporation is by asking my client. Mr. .Horde1, the

3

President of the corporation as to whom they sought admis-

5

Q

Well,...were you his lawyer at, that time?

6

A

Yes, I was.

7

Q

Did you advise him of that?

8

A

9

10

I advised him at that time , Your Honor , and

we did file a motion to be excused from answering the questions
temporarily, pending the outcome of the criminal case»

n

And when the Judge — Judge Levin in the District

12

Court, heard the argument, the Government represented to the

13

Court, and this is in the record, that there was no certainty

14

when or if even whether or if there would ever be a criminal

15

case? and the Court said,—-

- -

16

Q

You don’t take the prosecutors wordsfor that •

17

A

Well, 1 found that in this case, Mr. Justice

18

Black, but what happened is? of course, there might never be a

19

case if the answers to the interrogatories didn’t reveal

20

evidence to support their position.

21

they should have brought it* they didn’t need the admissions,

22

either to lay the basis forsummary judgment or to press forward

23

onthe case before if, because if they had all of this evidence

24

they can go back and retry the case without too ranch diffi­

25

culty.

39

But if they had a case,

1

Q

Mr. Friend, I have one question.

2

A

Yes„ sir.

3

Q

If yon don't mind.

It*a not clear to me what

4

use waSf in fact, made of the material that was acquired by

5

means of this pretrial discovery in the civil litigation.

6

What use was made of that material in the subsequent criminal

7

trial?
A

8
9

10

The Court of Appeals answered that question

and I'd like to refer the Court to, not only what the Court of
Appeals said, but the actual transcripto
On Page 142 and 43 I asked a question of the witness

u
12

as to whether they anticipated difficulty in proving inter­

13

state commerce with respect to the principal product known as'

14

Korleen.

15

And the answer was that they did have difficulty

16

i
proving interstate commerce with respect to Korleen manufacturer

\7

by a different manufacturer, but in. respect to the manufacture:"

18

that was involved in this case, theywouldn't have such diffi-

19

eulfcy, because they had the answers to the interrogatories.

20

.

Secondly, the fact of the matter was that these

21

answers to the interrogatories, which they say was not

22

necessary to get theindictment, was brought into the grand jury

«90

room as part of one file which they — for which they have put

24

both the civil and'the' criminal aspects and the results of

25

their investigation and that appears on Page 192 and 193,

40

1

where I ask the witness: "Isn’t it true that you used to assist

2

you in your testimony with the grand jury, almost all of the

3

papers that were in that one file which are/combined in the

4

civil and the criminal case."

5

ANSWER:

“I reviewed the entire file before I went

6

before the grand jury.

Yes,sir.

I had it with me and I used

7

it in preparing for the grand jury.

Yes, sir.5’

That was for the indictment?

That was for the indictment.

Q

My question was directed to ths trial.

If

A

That was prior to the trial, but with respect

12

to the interstate commerce, when we identified the manufac­

13

turer of the Korleen, that evidence was introduced into the

14

trial, not in the form of an answer to the interrogatory?

15

that's true, but -the information which we delivered.

16

final answer is that the Court of Appeals lays great stress

17

on this, it had been a practice of the FDA for 38 years —

18

a practice, bythe way, which has received a great deal of

19

criticism in the Administrative Law Review Journal and other

20

members of the Food and Drug- Bar.

And the

21

A practice whereby they bring a relatively simple

22

procedure to follow a civil case, do nothing to protect the

,23

public, either by summary judgment, multiple seizures or what

24

have you, and then put everything into one case, into one

25

file and then indict the person.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY LAWRENCE G, WALLACE,
ASSISTANT TO THE SOLICITOR GENERAL, ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE;

The Government did not make multiple
42

1

seizures eventually in this case and in. adroinsfcering the food

2

and drug laws the government tries to avoid Slaking multiple

3

seizures of products that are not harmful in themselves.
But the availability of multiple seizures has a

4

5

sanction after a misbranding case, a favorable judgment is

6

procured in a forfeiture proceeding, can serve as an induce­

7

ment to get a consent decree that, will eliminate the mis­

0

branding which we were seeking to do in this case, and not to

9

forfeit someone's property, that in the absence of the mis­

10

branding, should be allowed to be disseminated.

n

The record does not show to what extent Kordel and

12

the corporation should ba considered to be alter egos.in the

13

situation that was involved here, but it does show that the

!4

corporation never made any. claim that the information requested

15

was not available to it, within the meaning of Rule 33,

16

because only Kordel knew the information and he didn't want to

n

disclose it.

The corporation never made that claim.

Thank you.
