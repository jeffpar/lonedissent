Number 727, Vale against

the Court:

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

The Appellant in this case had been charged in a

proceedings prior to the one here at issue, with a violation
of the State Narcotics Law.

j

In the course of thatproceedings his bond was raised j
on the prior charge and three policemen with habeuses for his
arrest in connection with the raised bond, proceeded to what
was believed to be his home and they did what they called,
"staked themselves out," hid themselves near the home to watch
it for some reason.

They said they wanted to be sure he was

home before they arrested him.

I didn't quite understand.

In

17
18
19
20

any event, while they 'were waiting in hiding an automobile drove
up in front of the Appellant’s home audit was driven by a name
known to be a narcotics addict.
The driver sounded his horn, Appellant came out of

21
the house, talked to the driver from the other side, the
22

passenger side of the automobile, returned to his home, came
23
out again, again talked to the driver and then the police made
24
their presence known, surrounded the automobile, arrested the
25
2

1

driver who hastily put something into his mouth and presumably

2

swallowed it.
The police assumed that what they called a ”transac­

started to walk back into his home; they stopped him and
arrested him.

how far he -was from his home and 1 suppose at one point I
think it said he was at the front steps? at another he was at
the side of the car anywhere from 15 to 30 feet away.
In any event„ he was not inside the house when

arrested and I think the best way to put it was that he was on

police had no search warrant.

A

Had none whatever.

Q

They had an arrest warrant? did they, or —

A

They had the arrest warrants, but not for this

They had arrest warrants under a prior charge, on

which they staked themselves out, presumably to find him.
They had no arrest warrant for this, particular offense.
Q

But we can assume, I guess, in this

case that

1

this was a lawful arrest?
A

X think you would have to assume that, al­

3

though it's very difficult to say whether — they came out.

there to make a lawful arrest with an arrest warrant.

S

of doing that, they hid fchemselw

They went into the house and on their search, found

the narcotics, following which they charged him with possessior

of narcotics.

10

11

12
13

Q

Well, do you begin to complain before they

began the search?
A

No, sir.

Wall, as a matter of fact, this

Court has confined me to the matter of search and seizure.

14

So that ■—

15

Q

Xnconsidering the matter of search and seizure

16

it3s important to know whether we can assume, proceed on the

17

hypothesis that this was a lawful arrest.

18

'A

1 would have to assume —

19

Q

Because, X suppose that a search incident to

20

an unlawful arrest could never be a reasonable search,

21

A

Well, 1 so understand the law exactly.

22

Q

Whatever the scope of the search.

23

A

I would say this was a lawful arrest on the

24

basis of the offense which they believed to have seen taking

25

place and that thereafter they found the evidence on the basis
5

1

of which they mat.th® charge on which they had arrested him.

2

Now, that's about as close as I can come to it, on the record,

3

which is all that I have under all the circumstances.
Now, he had counsel appointed for him.

4

He moved to

5

suppress this evidence in a separate sort of proceeding, as I

&

understand it, typical in this type of case.

7

according to the record, to the introduction of the evidence

8

on the ground that It was obtained by an unconstitutional

9

search and seiaure„

He also objected,

He pleaded the Fourth and 14th Amendments.

to

The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the State and

11

they cited the statute, the arrest statute that permits the

12

officers to take from the person arrested all weapons and

13

incriminating articles which h® may have about his person.

14

They cited that statute in justification of this search and

:

IS
IS

held that there was no violation of the cited constitutional
belief.
I think that is a fair statement of the facts of the

17
18

purposes of this case.

statute as between saying, "about his person"and "an his
parson?”

22
23

•••-.
A

I don't? no, sir.

Q

It means the same thing.

A

24
25

Do you sea a diffe?@nst in the language of that

I think for practical purposes it doesn't
6

Q

1
2

it doesn't mean "about," in the -sense-of

"lying about?”

h

3

Perhaps, but I don't think that's involved

4

in this situation.

In any event, this says in so many words,

5

"from the person arrested or weapons which he may have about

G

his person,"
Now, as far as I am concerned, that means on his

7
0

person,

I think making a difference on a word of that sort,

9

in any event, it going too far in statutory —

I wondered if you were emphasising —

That's what 1 thought,

prior occasions,but I can't quite see the relevance of that
position which did arise in the trial court and the trial

Q

I just wanted to know? it was just unclear.

7

1

A

I don't think It's really relevant.

He admits

2

that the clothing was his? he admits that the narcotics were

3

taken from his clothing.

4

his mother said "He doesn’t live here? it's his brother who

5

lives here,," then they were both arrested and both tried.

6

don't think that that's

He never disputed that, and while

Now, some 200 years ago or more William /Pit

elder, in the House of Commons, or the Earl of Chatham, said

"The poorest man may, in his cottage, give defiance to all the

That's, I think, the fundamental, the beginning of
the principle which we now have embodied in the 4th Amendment.
At about that same era Lord Halifax was what was called in
England, one of the Secretaries of State, issued a general
warrant for the arrest of the publishers of the seditious
libel stated tohave appeared in the "North Britain."
On moving about the so-called "messengers," and T.
suppose equivalent to constables, learned that it was John
Wilkes who wasthe publisher of the libel and under that same
general warrant, not naming him or anyone else, Wilkes was

Ua-<d>

24

25

arrested? his house was ransacked? his papers were seized, they
called the blacksmiths that broke the locks, and so on — and
8

1

he sued the messengers and others and Lord Halifax, for libel,

2

or rather for the issuance of the unlawful writ and the

3

seizure, I should say.'. He recovered a thousand pounds against

Lord Halifax

opinion written at that time by Lord Chief Justice Pratt and

6

followed very shortly within the same few years, the same

7

decade, by the famous case of John Entic, who had been arrestee

8

and his papers all seised under a somewhat similar warrant,

9

except that it named him.

It was for seditious libel in the

British Freeholder, another publication.
And in that case, Lord Camden held: "That if this
practice which had originated in the Star Chamber should be
sanctioned.

The secret cabinets and bureaus of every subject

in this kingdom will be thrown open to search and inspection
whenever the Secretary of State shall see fit, to charge or
even suspect a person.
"And this power so assumed, is an execution on all
a party's papers, hie house, his rifle, his most valuable
papers are taken out and so on,” and then

May in his con­

stitutional history of England, that empty cases, only
covering perhaps ICO pages of fine print? it's a long-winded
thing, but May in his constitutional history of England, sums
it up: "Thatwith.the unanimous concurrence of Lord Mansfield
and the other judges of the Court, this eminent magistrate now
finally condemns this dangerous and unconstitutional practice.”

I

Mow, very interestingly, just before those two

2

famous English cases arose, a situation arose in the Massa­

3

chusetts Bay Colony,

4

issue general warrants which there were called "writs of

B

assistance," to search for merchandise on which the duties

6

imposed by Parliament had not been paid.

7

there were no places? they were simply to go out and it gave

8

them the right, presumably, to go into any warehouse, shop or

9

other place to search for these

The .British Ministry sent orders to

papers,

James Otis was the Attorney General of the Colony

1!

of ^Massachusetts under Crown appointment at that time.

He

12

refused to support the writs, resigned his office, took

13

employment on the other side without fee, and fought the

14

issuance of these writs from the Superior Court of Massa­

IS

chusetts, and the case was reported actually by John Adams,

!6

whose notes of the case arepublishesi.

t

17

13

He said in the first Amtfcance. that the court ex­
pressed great doubts to the legality of such a writ and the
s

19
20

authority of the court to grant it.
And Otis said in his argument: "The writ prayed for

2^

in this petition, being general, is illegal.

22

that places the liberty of every man in the hands of every

patty officer." In not more than one instance he went on and
he talked about the case in the Star Chamber,
Now, these writs were never issued, but at the
10

1

conclusion of his notes, John Mama said "American -independence

2

was then and there born.”

O
<»;

At the end of his argument, and I think this is very

4

significant language, Otis said: "That special writs only may

S

be granted on oath and probable suspicion.

6

William and Anne are confined to this sense, that an officer

7

should show probable grounds, should take his oath of it,

8

should do this before a magistrate and that such magistrate,

9

if he thinks proper, should issue a special warrant to search

10

II

The acts of

the place."
That language was almost copied verbatim 25 years

12

later into the Fourth Amendment.

13

how closely that language that he used in the argument as

14

reported by John Adams, tracks, or vie® versa, the language of

Q

Mow, may 1 ask you a question, Mr. Deutseh,

that relates that to the present situation.

I take it from

what you have just said that probably you would agree that the
information which the police had up to the time they went in tc
make the search and had presented that to the magistrate on
oath, they could have got a warrant?
A

Yes. The state makes the contention that this

was one of the hot pursuit cases that had to be done immediately
and if they had tried to go for a warrant, why, the evidence
would have disappeared, as usual and that short of thing, they

Oh, I don’t think there is any question about

could have stayed there while the other one went to get a
warrant.
Q

And if they stayed there — they had already

placed this man under arrest?
A

Yes.
And they had placed his brother under arrest.

A

And the driver of the car.

Q

Would they then have —

A

The only one there was the mother.

They would

have no trouble watching the place.

They could make them sit. in a chair under

arrest and wait until the warrant got back? is that it?

I think they could have.

Without invading their privacy?

gave yo» you would not agree that he1could have made the two

I think what he could have done before they

entered, with the three officers, one of them could have gone
back for a warrant and the other two could then have said:
"While we wait for the warrant we will, come in here; we will
not conduct, a search? we will simply sit here and make sure
that no evidence that might be here would disappear.

Do you think this case just turns on James,

Eoi Isd go furthers Shipley, which is the one

you decided on the same day as the Chime 1 ease.

Q

You mean you think they govern this?

6

A

I just can’t see any difference and the only

7

reason I have put my case on the basis of which 1 have,

S

especially in this oral argument, is that 1 can’t understand

9

why you would ask for a hearing.

10

Q

Why we didn't do this one summarily, too?

11

A

Well, I go further than that.

Exactly the

12

same as the Chime 1 case.

13

situation except it goes back one step because he wasn’t in

14

the home when arrested.

15

Well, not, 1 mean then you would have to assume

16

that Chime1 was

Chimel was what?

13

It's open? it involves a similar

retroactive, but the other case decided with
Shipley?

Shipley and Van Cleef, but Shipley is very

19

closely in point, because ha was arrested as he was getting

20

out of his automobile near his home.

1

Q

So, it's in the line with James» Shipley is?

z

A

Exactly,

And 1 gust wantvto mention, if I may,

3

as a little interesting sidelight» that the James case — I

4

have talked about Jamas Otis who was the father of the 4th

5

Amendment.

This man's name was Otis James.

6

Now, in Shipley» vary frankly, what this Court said,

7

not: referring to the Chimel case at all: "The constitution has

8

never been construed,” and that statement 1 cannot find any

9

exception? I can't find that that's wrongs "by this Court to

10

claim, to allow this belief in the absence of aa emergency,

11

to arrest a person outside his home and then take him inside

12

for the purpose of conducting a warrantless search.

13

contrary if. has always been assumed that one's house cannot

14

unlawfully be searched without a search warrant except as an

15

incident to a lawful arrest therein."
How, that's a pro curiam decision.

16

On the

The statement, as

1?

I said, the position of the state in this Court at any rate,

18

is that this was, in effect, a hot pursuit and this wasn't

IS

really a general search, that it lasted only two or three

20

minutes.

21

22
23

24
25

Now, I dispute that.

As a matter of fact on the

record, and I'll take only a moment to mention that the brief
for the State says: "At approximately a minute or two, no more
than three minutes" — Mo? I'm sorry? that's the facts there.
"Within minutes»" says the brief, "after entering
19

the house„ the officers found the heroin and dilaudid and so

on."

the appendix which says:

no more than three minutes, Officer Leman had walked into the

back bedroom and while I was standing in the front room,

house.

without a warrant.

This Court hasheld continually and it. even, as late
as Chime1, that while -~
Q

We all have trouble with that and it might

interest you that counsel for that side was here not long ago
and he told us that was pronouncedr
A

"Kimel."

Even as late as Your Honors * decision in

Chime! it was taken to be settled jurisprudence of this Court
that following & valid arrest an incidental search can be made
Wow, the way. 1 understand — the State of Louisiana
certainly argues “that a valid arrest without warrant was “made
in this case', at the ~~ right at the front door of the house,
steps of the house.

We concede that it was not in the house;

Vale was returning to his house»
Now, if a valid arrest was made, an incidental
search contemporaneous with this arrest, under the jurispru­
dence of this Court, an incidental search was permissible»
And as the State of Louisiana sees it, the only issue before
this Court is whether the scope of that incidental search wafi
also permissible»
In other words —
Q

What were you searching for?

25

22

A

i

The police officers testified, Mr» Justice,

z

that they were sure that there were narcotics in that house,

3

because as they watched the house to be sure Donald Vale was

4

there before going forward with these prior arrest warrants

B

fchey had, that what they saw convinced them — Donald Vale had

6

gone back in the house to get the narcotics which he brought

out and sold to Saucier

A

No, sir? they were looking, and the State of

Louisana concedes, because, from the record the State of
Louisiana has to concede that the police officers testified
that they were sure there were narcotics in that house in which
James Vale — Donald Vale had gone in.
was where his supply was.

They were sure that

If he could come out of that house

and sell to the people who would come out to the house, like
Saucier in,the instant case•
So, when they saw him go back in the house, come
back out within minutes, look up and down the street as he
went down the steps and put his head in the car in what they
were convinced was a narcotics sale.

And then when they

approached the .house Saucier swallowed the narcotics and they

25

frisked down Donald Vale and Saucier and found nothing on them j

they testified that they were convinced that the source of

those narcotics were in 'the house.

arrest, constitutionally permissible in scope?
How, there is no doubt about it, under the jurisprudence of this Court they had the right, following this
valid arrest, without a warrant in front of the house, to
frisk down Saucier and Vale? no doubt about that under the
settled decisions of this Court.
How, the State of Louisiana and under the

rather,

under the Chimel decision, the incidental arrest has been
confined to the area in which the accused could reach.

Well,

there is no doubt about it that the search in the instant case
went beyond an area into which Donald Vale could have reached,
because it was inside the house.
Mow, it's Louisiana’s, position that this was an
emergency situation and thatifc was impossible to get a search
warrant — impossible to get a search warrant in advance, be­
cause they didn't know that they were going to be confronted
with this emergency sale which took place? before their ayes.

They thought they ware goingthere to arrest this, man on prior

Vale, his mother, know that they were looking for Donald with

fact and therefore, they wanted to be — they had gotten a tip
