Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and Members

In this case Petitioner Wade was tried with a

co-defendant, Pollard, was convicted of murder in the first

IQ

degree.

11

Had 'fch'dy bden tried separately, under the California Rules of

22

the Court, each of the co-defendants would have been furnished

13

separate trial transcripts.

14

and therefore, under the Rules, only one transcript was made

15

available to both defendants and that transcript was sent to

26

the co-defendant Pollard.

17
18
19

Each of the defendants filed notice to appeal.

22

However, they were tried together,

Wade here, did not see that transcript.

He didn’t

have the opportunity, therefore, to inspect the transcript
before it was certified as correct, for purposes of his appeal.j

It would be subs cantia1ly less than

What we have here, then, in summary, is a case that

20
really presents, I think, a fairly narrow issue.

A case where

the defendant was denied his rightful transcript by the applica*

txon of the California Rules of Court, in connection with his

We feel that the operation of the California Rules
of Court are discriminatory in at least two respects: -Number
one in the way they discriminated between defendants tried

17

separately and defendants tried jointly.

m

tried separately he is entiled to the transcript whether he's

19

a millionaire or not, and regardless of the seriousness of the

20

crime involved or the severity of the sentence imposed, if he

is tried jointly he isn't entitled to a separate transcript

22

even if he is an indigent.

If a detendant is

I

23
24
25

We also feel that there is a second basis for
claiming discrimination as far as indigents are concerned?
that the operation of the California Rules of Court preclude
5

I

an indigent co-defendant from receiving a right to a trial

2

transcript in connection with an appeal and this case is an

3

example of how that rule .can work.

4

feel that the rules as they operate, tend to unconstitutionally

deny, particularly an indigent his right to a trial transcript,

€

So that, therefore, we

Now, the state has argued that all that's necessary

7

is access and that the attorney on appeal had access to the

8

trial transcript for purposes of briefing the case.

9

all, this case demonstrates access may not be sufficient in

just possible that it would work out that way.

12

j

It's

Secondly, and perhaps more fundamentally, is the

13

burden that it places on appointive counsel in trying to brief j

!4

and prepare cases, if they have only access to a record, where

j
\

15

they have to borrow it from the Attorney General of the State.

16

I have cited in the brief references to some of the problems

17

encountered as discussed and recognised by this Court in the

18

Hardy case, that appointed counsel in indigent cases may face

19

when they are trying to prepare cases.

20

So, therefore, I feel that the type of access that

21

the State says is made available here, really should not be

22

viewed as constitutionally sufficient for the protection of

23

indigents to give them the same sort of access to legal chan-

24

nels to effectuate justice as are available to persons who are

25

not indigents.

locking at that footnote in the Court of Appeals * Opinion?

remedies?

I really don’t

think so.

thing in that which precludes our reaching the merits of the

No, sir, I don’t,

I think that remark was

to raise in this proceeding,

You do’t think any particular showing is

20

necessary to prejudice in a particular case.

access to the record by Appellant Counsel and there — is uhere

any suggestion that he could have done better with a transcript

23

of his own or anything specific?

I’m really not prepared to make that contention,

I think we can only gpsculate as to what prejudice resulted to

Well, do you rely at all on the unava. lability

of the transcript to prepare for rehearing'?

A

8

We can only speculate on

Yes, I do.

I am afraid that the record in this

case is not as satisfactory as it should ba, although I believe
if'the state’s willing to concede th

factual predicate as set

10

out in the exhibits to my reply brief, that there is basis for

n

certainly contending that the record is not available for pre­

12

paration for petition for rehearing.
Q

13

U

Well, what do you want to win for, so you can

get another appeal?
A

IS

That would be, I think, the ultimate result.

16

First of all, 1 think that the man is entitled to a copy of his

17

transcript so he can at the very least, at the minimum, he can

18

at least have a copy of his transcript so that he can examine

10

it and prepare his basis for collateral attack. As step two,

20

and we had asked for that in our original brief that we filed.

21

Ha should -have a right to appellate review, again of his con­

22

viction „

23

I
!

Because, primarily, our first argument is that he
should at least, as the very minimum, ha® a right to a trans­
cript to prepare for collateral attack.

8

Q

1

Has this Court ever held that the state must

2

furnish a transcript in order to prepare a petition for Federal

3

relief?
A

Not specifically.

5

be drawn by putting together cases such as Smith and Bennett

6

and Gardner versus California.

corpus by a minimal $4.00 filing fee, I think it was.
In Gardner, in effect, the Court was saying, just this;

habeus corpus proceeding you had to make available a tran3cri.pt
of the prior proceeding.

25

A

That was state habeus; that's correct.

A

But is there a right to counsel to prepare

No; not necessarily.

And, of course, that

the point that we made in our brief, that you can draw a
legitimate distinction between right to counsel where a man
must file repeated habeus corpus petitions*which may or nay not
foe meritorious and the right of the transcript, which you need
only once.

That was state habeus, wasn’t it, Mr. Small?

That3s correct.
Because he was tried jointly and the other chap

was supposed to have got a transcript, the rules deny him one.

A

That's righti he has none of his own.

10

Q

That's the only basis, is it, of your Equal

A

Well, I think you could carry it on a step

13

further and say that there are other examples of how he was

14

discriminated against, including on collateral attack.

15

not in the same position as a person who is a monied defendant.

here in this particular proceeding, but simply the right to the

But, on

the facts that were alleged'in the habeus petition here, which
hadn’t been denied, Petitioner Wade never saw a copy of his
transcript? never had it available..
One other point in connection with the state’s
argument to access as was the ce.se here, of being sufficient.
It works a partlculary discriminatory result on the subsequent
proceeding on collateral attack because even if you say access
is sufficient, for any defendant, that you only have to allow
him to see a transcript and not give him a copy of it, then
the state switches his position on collateral attack and no
longer grants the right of access, and in affect, is saying,
"Well, you can’t see your transcript unless you first show
meritorious grounds for upsetting your conviction.

So chat eve

if you were to use the access point that the state is using
here to try and uphold the procedures, the Petitioner hare is
placed in a less advantageous position than he otherwise would
11

1

be.
The state is arguing? in effect? two points —

2
3

essentially two points as I see it, in trying to sustain the

4

position that Petitioner should not have a right to the trans­

5

6

burden on the state economically would just be terrifying,

They were referring to statistics where maybe no

This is a

case where a transcript had been prepared and was, indeed,
available and could easily have been copied at a fairly small
cost.
So, the types of statistics that the state has cited
for the purpose of establishing undue economic burden, really
aren't, relevant to this particular case.

of this case.
Q

I'm not sure that it’s relevant at ally and

5

please don't assume I'm suggesting any criticism on the ques­

tion, but I wonder if you made any effort to consider getting

an order to show cause on the co-defendant, or other processes

to get that

Ho, sir? I felt under the terms of the appoint­

10

ment that my obligation was to brief and argue the case before

11

this Court.

13

asked you to be here.

14

A

15

The second argument that the state presents for

IS
17

Yes, X recognise that.

You are hare because we

Yes# sir.

denying the right to transcript to this Petitioner is that it
may have a deleterious effect upon prison discipline.

The

13

suggestion is made that if a prisoner gets his transcript, he

10

might be discussing his case with other prisoners and this

20

could hamper prison discipline.

2!

I'm a little perplexed by this argument, because as

22

I understand it, a prisoner who, say, was tried individually,

23

24
23

rather than jointly, convicted and furnished the transcript
would be entitled to keep his transcript and havb it in prison
with him and use it there
13

1

So that, in effect, the state is arguing that it5s

2

only co“defendants who are tried jointly who might be causing

3

problems with prison discipline by having a right to their

4

transcript.

5

holds water when you look at the practicalities of -the situa­

6

tion ,

7

And 1 just don’t think that this argument really

The basic premise, I think here — that you come

8

down to, really, is the question©f trying to balance — carry

9

out as effectively as possible the administration of justice

10

for persons who are incarcerated by not clogging up the chan­

'ii

nels of judicial administration and making available to them

12

the instruments necessary to vindicate their rights, while at

13

the same time not thrusting unreasonable burdens on the state.

14

It seems to me that in this particular type of

15

situation where you have a man who would have had a transcript

16

but for the peculiar operation -— discriminatory operations

17

of the California law, where a transcript is available and

18

can easily be reproduced, that the balance should be struck in

19

favor of making the transcripts available to a person such as

20

this indigent.

21

Griffin, Roberts and LaVallee? those cases, to try to ensure

22

that the channels of the courts, the access to the vindication

23

of legal rights will be available to all, without any distinc­

24

tion based on financial position of the defendant involved.

And the fourth fact, and I think this ties in with
your question, Mr. Chief Justice; and I think it's the fact that
{
we have to emphasise in this proceeding. It is that California I

an attorney on appaal; and has given that attorney an access to

During the course of the

Your Honor, if there was any complaint.

If

1©

any appointed attorney had a complaint that a transcript was

11

not available to him toprepare a brief on appeal, all the

12

attorney would have to do under the rules of court, would bring

13

this to the attention of the court and the court would take the

14

necessary action, either to reproduce a copy of the Court’s

transcript' or order the co-appellant to furnish his copy to the

16

appellant who does not have a copy.

Yes, Your Honor.

record.

Wow, Counsel for Petitioner has attempted to

narrow this down and to paint the state as being irresponsible

the answer- to your question is that should be

What we think is before the Court -- the problem

S

,

before the Court, is not limited to this particular case.

The

problem before the Court is whether or net when an indigent
makes no allegation on collateral attack* of any errors that
occurred in his trial, is a state then responsible to turn
over its copy or the copy of any other documents* whether they
be police reports* any other matters that might be connected
with thecriminal proceedings; matters of physical evidence
that might have been produced at the trial.

Whether or not the

Stats is then responsible to turn over these documents because
a man wants to engage in an exploration or fishing expedition.

of the state, that it is satisfied; that it has given the man

That's the way he posits the

You, on the other hand, say that the issue in this

case has nothing to do with that, but rather is the question of

whether a state is obligated under the Constitution — I suppose

11

now, the Due Process Clause — to provide at a state convict's

12

arbitrary request, a free transcript of that convict’s trial,

13

even in the absence of any allegations whatsoever on the part

14

of the convict as to any error that occurred at his trial that

15

might be subject to collateral attack, which is a much broader

One of the

points that the Chief Justice raised was the possibility of
ordering Pollard, the co-defendant here, who still has a copy
of-the transcript, to turn it over at this stage of the pro­
ceedings to be used by this Petitioner Wade.

I’d have a

question in ray own mind whether California would permit such a
procedure because the procedure for sharing transcripts is
couched in terms of the direct appeal processes and I, there­
fore, would have a really substantial question as to whether
California courts would be prepared to enter such an order at
this time.

33

1

3

But since the co-defendant presumably has it,

2

or may havt it in his possession for use for the same purpose,

3

why couldn't the District Judge have issued such an order to

4

show cause.on that co~defendant, either at the request of

S

counsel, if they had the imagination to ask for it, or on his

10

S

My argument is that it was incumbent upon them

A

9

to have supplied it years ago and because they didn't the
accused should not be placed in a less advantageous position

12

now because of his indigency and having to show meretorious

grounds for reversal before he can even have a look at his

That’s right and in the same way in most states

as we point out in our brief.

the states give transcripts to individua *, defendants and to
