ARGUMENT OF J. B. TIETZ, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. TIETZ;

1
8

Mr. Chief Justice and gentlemen of the

Court:
This is a draft prosecution for refusal to submit to

9
10

induction because the petitioner didn't get the conscientious

11

objector classification.

12

and sincere.

13

He objects to all wars, so that is not involved.

Everyone concedes that he was truthful
.

He is not an athiest, so that is not involved.

But the main objection of the Government is that his

14
15

religion with which he started out. by saying, ”1 am nonreligious

16

is the bone of contention.

17
18

point, I would like to deal with the two threshold matters that
could be dispositive of the case.
The first is the short-circuit, the corner-cutting by

20
21

Before we get to the First Amendment

the Government at the induction proceedings.

I have briefed

it.

Nov; that is the

It is the same argument that was used by the Government in

the Welsh matter v?hen he didn’t get tendered to him the security|

questionnaire.

And for the rationale in there, they decided

8

that it was required.
Now the same thing runs through the thread here.

8

There!

10

is one point, though, that is not too material.

11

Government keeps saying that he refused.

12

refuse, he raised the question and then the best reason why they

13

short-circuited him is in the one sentence statement of the

14

Government — rather, in the majority opinion below — that a

15

district judge who wrote the opinion, concurred in by one of the

16

circuit judges.
They put it this way;

Actually he didn’t

induction pending investigation, induction station personnel

My thought is this;

!

Army regulations that no selectee shall be inducted when he
either qualifies or refuses to execute the oath, pending a
thorough investigation, he is entitled to that.

And just as in

these other cases 1 mentioned, that was held to have sufficient

si

prejudice, it should apply here, because not as the Government

2

argues that he can by that avoid induction possibly for months

3

and forcing the military to waste its intelligence resources,

4

all the Government has to do is — I mean, all the Army has to

5

do is strike out a few words, substitute a word or two and they

S

can have it in the Federal Register in two or three days.

■

Now, fortunately for the security of the country, the

7
8

Army is alert and when it seas things it should deal with, it

9

does so fairly promptly.
For example, when 1 got back in practice in '44, about

the first man in the office was Yost.

He was on leave from Campj

Roberts where he said he had been forcibly inducted.

14

men who had passed the physical examination, and the inducting

15

officer came over and said, "Hold up your right hand and repeat

IS

the oath after me’."

He testi­

He testified as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, "I couldn't;;

The trial judge believed him, granted a writ, the Government tod!,

20

21

the Army saw the light and it changed the induction proceedinge s j

22

23

forward .

But before an en banc decision affirming the appeal, j

another matter and that was when Corrigan came in the office,

A

12

I think you might well address yourself to

The point 1 am trying to make now is that he has

13

exactly the same situation as Seeger did.

He qualifies as the

14

Circuit Judge HamXey put it, "He showed there is no basis, in

35

fact, for saying he didn't have a parallel equivalent belief."

16

In fact, I think he is in a better position than Seeger for this

17

reason.

13

19

Q

Was that one of the questions presented in your

writ of certiorari?
?

20

A

The three, that there is a constitutional point,

21

that is a security questionnaire point, and that the man meets

22

— these have all been briefed.

23
24

25

This point that 1 am arguing

now, that he qualifies, has been brief thoroughly and, curiously
enough, this is a very striking thing.
The Government’s argument that he doesn’t qualify is

So he had the training.

Now the opinion of the Court

below in the words of the dissenting judge, they concede that he
j
had the strength of conviction, the strength of belief, that he
just doesn't have the religious background.

former for this reason.

That is precisely the conclusion that

concluded, and that is our conclusion.
Now when Seeger encountered the form, he struck out

8

certain words and put quotation marks about the word "religion."

9

Now I take that, to mean that what Seeger was saying, "If you wan-;

10

to call what I believe religious/' and fortunately the Court did

say he has the equivalent.

12

being religious.

13

You can do that.

Now Welsh did more.

But he disavows

He struck out the word "relious/*

14

but as I argued in the briefing, a man is not wholly to be

15

judged by what he says and especially he wrote a reply to the

16

Attorney General's recommendation to the Appeal Board, a reply

17

that he was permitted to encouraged and invited to write by

18

the regulations in force.

19

Congress has done away with that now.

He' wrote a reply, which as Circuit Judge Hamiey says,

20

adequately answered, and he learned from the Seeger decision

21

that under that definition he then could be considered to meet,

22

the requirements of law.

23

He has it made, I think, from that standpoint.

24

Now on the question of the constitutionality, that of

25

course is one which I argued as thoroughly as I could.

9

!

I pointed

1

out the four or five decisions of this Court which, as I inter- j

2

pret them, say not only may not Congress distinguish between

3

religions, but it may not distinguish between religion and

4

irreligion„

ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.

10

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

n

MR. GRISWOLD?

May it please the Court:

12

This is a difficult and troublesome case.

I hope that

13

I can be of assistance to the Court in coming to a sound solu­

14

tion of the problem it presents.

15

The statutory provision is clear.

It is set out near j

16

the top of page 9 of the Government’s brief.

17

events occurred here, this Court had already decided the case

18

of United. States against Seeger, but the statutory pre-vision

19

still contained the language which appears at the middle c£ page1

At the time the

In 1967 this was amended to strike out the reference

to a Supreme Being, so it now says simply the term "religious

3
10
11
12

13
14

Applying the statute to the facts in

in these cases, the Court concluded with Judge Hamley dissenting
that there was a basis, in fact, for the conclusion of the
Selective Service authorities that Welsh’s objection to service
were not based on religious training and belief, and that he did
not come within this Court's decision in the Seager case.
The hearing officer who met and talked with him reported

15

that he "stressed that his belief is that his opinions have been

16

formed by reading in the fields of history and sociology, and

17
18

that they are purely rational as opposed to religious."
Of course, we fully accept theconstruction of the

13

statute made by this Court in the Seeger case.

20

provides exemption from military service for persons who, in the

21

statutory language, "by religious training and belief are opposed

22

to war in any form."

23
24

case which wrote out all content from the word "religious,"

11

12

he?

13

within the military or else nonmilitary civilian work?

He would not have been exempt, would

He would have been assigned to either noncombatant duty

A

14

If his draft board had found that he came within

15

the statute and there was not evidence on which it could have

16

found otherwise, then he would have been entitled to one or the

other of two classifications — either I-A-0 or 1-0.
Wow I-A-0 is "available for military service, but non-

combatant," essentially medical service you are put ift, but there

20

are other types of service,

.

21

1-0 would be "completely exempt from military service,

22

but subject to civilian service of," the statute says, "national

23

importance,"

24

or to other types of nonmilitary work.

25

Q

And they are usually assigned to civilian hospitals

And are they assigned either to I-A-0 or 1-0 and

are relevant.

Representative Scott made a very similar proposal,

No, that is what the final provision was.

15

"Congress shall make no lav/ establishing articles of

It then went on to the Senate, where we have no infor­

The propriety of the exemption based on religious
training and belief has at least been recognized and accepted by
this Court in recent years.

There is, first, I would mention

the Wifcmer case in 348 U.S. where the Court said, "Because the
ultimate question in conscientious objection cases is the sin­
cerity of the registrant in objecting on religious grounds to
participation in war in any form."
And then, finally, there is the Seeger case itself

18

where the notion or the idea that the restriction to religious

19

training and belief was valid is surely implicit.

20

fectly plain, of course, that the Court gave a very bread con­

21

ception to the meaning of ‘'religious training and belief," to

22

which we take no exception whatever.

23

that case which indicates that the Court was intending to tfrite

24

the word ’’religious''’ out of the statute or to hold that, it was

tion.

Then I think I would like to ask you this ques-

j

It is not necessary to answer it now,
!

18

Supposing despite history of the Establishment Clause

j

19

you take the very broad sweep this Court has given the Establish-:-

20

scent Clause in its decision, and you start from the premise that ;

21

while the Constitution did not require Congress to give any

22

exemption, religious or otherwise, to anybody, that Congress

23

in the interest of giving, in effect, some play to the Free

24

Exercise Clause put in the religious exemption in order to give

25

that effect, what is the answer to the argument that having

Ij

24

1

chosen that course, it perforce operates within the broad sweep

2

of this Court's decisions as an establishment of religion?

3

A

I don't know, Mr. Justice,, that I can say much

4

more than I have.

5

Establishment Clause has been pushed very far and it oughtn't to

6

be pushed any further.

7

Q

Perhaps it ought to be cut back.

8

A

And more specifically that it ought not to be

My first argument on that would be that the

More specifically

pushed to apply to this particular situation, and I can find

80

no doctrinal or historical basis on which there should be? indeed

It

all the evidence seems to me to be to the contrary.

The other question is what I tried to deal with very

83

summarily, in too short a time, but it seems to me to be essen­

14

tially a Fifth Amendment question.

15

proper classification, a classification which Congress could

16

make and not be arbitrary under the Fifth Amendment, to allow

17

exemption to persons who hold these views by reason of religious

IS

training and belief and not to allow them to others.

19

That, is, whether it. is a

And on that here again, feeling as much as argument

20

has a great deal to do with it I suppose, it does seem to me

2?

that an argument can be made that there is a difference in

22

quality between objection which, in the broadest base, are

23

religious in nature having some connotation with the unknown,

24

with what is about and beyond us, on the one hand, and those

25

which are merely intellectual, merely rational, merely internal,
25

i

on the other.
That is an argument which isn't easy for me. to

z
3

verbalise because in the Quaker tradition that I am familiar

4

with, it is the inner voice which expresses the external force.

5

So I can't say it is a question of whether it external or inter-

6

nal? but it does seem to me that it relates to whether it deals

7

with the unknown and what is beyond usf on the one hand; and

8

what the man out of his own intellectual activity rationalises

9

for a conclusion for himself.
And my position on that would be that that is a classif

10
11

fication, a distinction which Congress has made for

12

which was well understood and contemplated at the time the

3
4
5

IS

amendment was adopted,, that it would not be a construction of
the Constitution to say that Congress cannot do it.

9
20
21

22

It would

be an extention of it beyond anything that was contemplated
either at its drafting or in a century and a half since then.

the term as construed in Seagar.

that he did have a religious motivation."
