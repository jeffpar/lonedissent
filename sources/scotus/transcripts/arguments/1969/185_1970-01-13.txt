MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Case Mo. 185, Augie

Rest.z against Bozanich.
Mr. Cranston, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ARGUMENT OF CHARLES K. CRANSTON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. CRANSTON:

May it please the Court:

This case

8

involves the resolution of issues concerned with the .

9

regulation of the basic industry of the State of Alaska, its

10

fishing resource, and in particular it relates to the manner

11

in which applicants may be awarded net gear licenses to fish

12

for salmon in Alaska,

13

was passed by the 1968 Legislature of the State of Alaska, and

14

requires that a licensee in order to be awarded a salmon net

15

gear fishing license must either have been licensed as a net

16

gear licensee in the area in which he wishes to fish, or that

17

he was actively engaged in commercial fishing for three years

13

in the areci in which he desires to be licensed.

18

The statute which is here under attack

The appellees sought to have the statute declared

20

unconstitutional in the light of certain provisions of the

21

United States Constitution and in the light of certain

22

provisions of the State of Alaska Constitution.

23

Alaska Constitutional provisions require that there, shall be

24

granted no exclusive right or privilege of fishery, and that
i
the fish resource is reserved to all of the people for their

25

2

The State of

i

!

common use.

2

I three judge District. Court in Anchorage,Alaska,

3

held the statute unconstitutional as being in violation of

4

the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment and the two

5

Alaska Constitutional provisions to which I have referred.

6

is the position of the State of Alaska that summary judgment

7

was improperly granted in this case, and that the basic issue

3

involved it whether or not the provision allowing new entrance

3

into the salmon fishery by virtue of their right to fish

10

commercially for three years is illusory, whether it is

11

meaningless

12

It

or not.

^’he three judge District Court concluded that notwith­

13

standing the provision, entry into the fishery was controlled

14

net by the stats, as intended by the statute, but by the

15

fishermen themselves.

16

conclusion of the three judge court: is not supported by the

17

record, and for that reason summary judgment should not have

13

been granted on the record as it appeared before the Court at

19

that time„

It is the state’s position that this

5

'

'.'he allegations in the pleadings relative to this

20
21

aspect of

:he case were denied, and the pertinent affidavits

22

and answer:; to interrogatories did not touch on the issue,

23

although the Court itself found that there was no right of new j
-

24

entry other than by the permission of those already in the

2.5

fishery.

|

1

Q

State that again.

2

h

The three judge District Court concluded that
j

<'r

in fact for a person to be eligible for a salmon net gear

4

license in Alaska, he had to receive employment by those

5

already engaged in the fishery, and therefore the right to his

6

license was; not within his control, but was within the control

7

of others, and on this basis the Court concluded the fishery-

8

in effect was closed, there was an exclusive right, and the

S

right, was not open to all who might wish to enter.

5

Does the state contest that?
The state contests this finding, Mr, Justice.,

j|

12

.
,
on the has: s that it xs not supported by any facts presently

i

1.3

in the record, or by any implications which could be drawn

14

from those facts in the record.

IS

of the statute which allows a license to be issued to one who

m

fishes commercially for three years is sufficient in allowing

17

new entry :.nto the fishery.

Q

18

What was the basis for the District Courtes

19

conclusion in that respect?

20

of the statute, .1 take it?

21

does it?

22

A

We feel that the provision

If was not just the construction
The statute does not say that,

Wo, Mr, Justice, the statute says only that a

23

license may be issued to one who has fished actively as a

24

commercial licensee for three years.

25

Q

Or has had a salmon license in the last year.

4

i

i\

1
1

Or has had a salmon license in any year in

the particular area.
o

Then what was the basis for the District

4

Court’s conclusion that just as a matter of the way the statute

6

operates, no one could get a license unless existing fishermen

6

approved of it?
h

7

Is that it?
Yes, Mr. Justice.

I would assume that is the

8

basis on which the Court made its finding, that it determined

9

that the application of the law resulted in this.

This of

10

course is the very point which I am arguing, that if the Court

11

is going to determine that this is how the law

12

application, then more facts are needed.
Q

13

operates in

Let me ask you., in these salmon fishing areas,

14

how would one be a commercial fisherman except by fishing for

15

salmon?

16

from which he can make a living catching them?

17

Are there other commercial fish in those same areas

A

Mr. Justice, I would answer that question by

18

stating yes, one can fish commercially in Alaska, for fish

19

other than salmon.

20

21

22

Q

As a matter of fact, does anybody do it and

make a living without fishing forsalmon in those areas?
A

Again, this is not disclosed by the record,

23

but I would assume that there are people who make a living

24

fishing for halibut, fishing for crab.

25

Q

In those same salmon areas?
5

1

T.

Yes, although this again gets to my basic point;

2

that in order to determine this, to answer your question, sir,

3

there would have to be hearings at the District Court level in j

4

order to answer this question»

3

that others; may make a living at fishing commercially for fish \

6

other than salmon»

7

can't make a living, and this is something that should be

3

determined in plenary proceedings.

1 believe 'the state would agree j

Appellees, of course, assert that maybe they

Let us assume that a man works as an employee

Q

Do you have to be licensed as a commercial

fisherman to work as an employee for a salmon fisherman?
A

to engage in the activity of fishing, one would have to have

Upon!

I

Q

t

Does the law require you actually to fish

2

three years; as a commercial fisherman rather than just to hold

3

the license as a commercial fisherman?
A

4

The laa does require that you fish.

It states

5

that the licensee must have been actively engaged .fa the

6

activity of commercial fishing, and there are other statutory

7

requirements which require that a prospective licensee furnish

S

affidavits to this effect, that he has actively engaged in the

9

fishery for each of those years.
I believe that the very questions which have been

10

U

asked indicate that in order to determine the application of

12

this stature to the fishery involved that there are questions

13

which have not been resolved, and which should have been

14

resolved prior to the lower Court®s awarding summary judgment.

13

I
This case is a clear example of the proposition that important i

16

Constitutional questions are usually not appropriate for

17

s ummary j udgment „

18

Appellees themselves have cited the case, England

19

vs. Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners which contains the

20

quote, "It is the typical, not the rare case, in which

21

Constitutional claims turn upon the resolution of contested

22

factual issues."

.23

involving an important Constitutional question for the State

24

of Alaska, and that there are contested factual issues

25

remaining.

1 would assert that this is the typical case

Certainly the conclusion of the Court should not
7

rest upon such an inadequate factual basis.
1 will give some examples of the inadequate factual
basis.

The* Appellees state that the new entry provisions are

illusory., and whether they are illusory depends upon facts
which they have set forth in their statement of facts, much of
which did not appear as the record in the lower Court:.

For

instance, ;.t is possible for one to engage in salmon fishing
as a commercial licensee and troll.

Trolling is an activity

which does not require salmon net gear.
fishing.

It is salmon fishing.

It is commercial

The relationship of this

activity to the application of the statute has not been
investigated by the lower Court, and is not on record at this
time in order for this Court to investigate it.
Also, Appellees assert that that the unique effect
of eleven salmon registration areas in Alaska prohibits easy
movement of commercial salmon fishermen from one area to
another area with the statutory prohibition.

We will agree

that there are eleven salmon fishing registration areas, but
we will not agree at this stage in the proceedings that the
effect of those regulations on the statute prohibits free
movement of fishermen from one area to the other, to their
economic detriment, as Appellees assert.
Q

What do you mean by eleven places?

A

Mr. Justice, Alaska's coast line in which the

salmon fishery is engaged covers approximately 3,000 or 3,500
8

1

miles.

z

Arctic Ocean, the coast line is segmented into eleven districts

3

based generally upon geography, the coast line, the types of

From southeast. Alaska, near Ketch lean up to near the

bays involved, and perhaps based upon the species of fish which
•»

appear in those areas.

When one acquires a license to fish

8

for salmon in Alaska, he is licensed only for one of those

7

eleven areas, and if during one season he acquires a license

3

for, say, the southeast Alaskan area, he may not then fish in

9

the Bristol Bay area.

He is limited to a particular area

10

during each season.

I!

coupled with the area requirement in effect closes the class

12

of those who may engage in the commercial salmon fishery.

13

would assert that in order to reach this decision, this

14

conclusion.' the application of the statute in the light of

15

the entire aspect of the areas involved bears further

16

investigat:.on.

Appellees assert that the statute

If he wishes to fish in Bristol Bay

in a year other than the year in which he is licensed in

10

{

Q

That is your point, then, is'it, the requirement

of the throe year preparation?

My point is that the deprivation of his right

It

to fish based upon the application of the area requirement is

12

not necessarily clear from the state of the record as it

13

appeared in the lower Court.

14

ment upon his right to use his vessel,upon his right to use

out in the lower Court record.

If he in fact is deprived of
.

.

17

the use of his fishing vessel, or of the right to fish in any

18

particular area because of the area requirement, that

19

conclusion cannot be reached on the basis of the record as
■

20
21

22

it appears in this Court.
Q

Did the District Court rest on this ground?

i1
A

The District Court did not discuss this ground
\

23

too heavily, Mr. Justice.

24

quite heavi.ly in their brief, and I would assert that in order j

25

The Appellees argued this ground

to reach the conclusion that the Appellees may be deprived

10

1

of the use of their vessels during any particular salmon

2

fishing season because of the area requirement is not

3

supported by the record at the present, time.

:

4

"he main point I am attempting to make is that the

5

fishery regulation in Alaska is extremely complex, involving

3

areas of differing types of salmon, differing weather

7

conditions,, differing sea conditions, and at the state at

3

which the District Court reached its conclusion,

9

particular factors had been investigated by the Court.

10

none of these

A second point which the State of Alaska is urging

13

is that the District Court should have abstained completely

12

from reaching a conclusion in this case.

33

argument that the District Court should have abstained is due

14

to the fact that Appellees asserted that the statute violated

15

unique provisions of the Alaska Constitution.

16

are, as I have stated, that no exclusive right of fishery

17

should be granted, and that the fish resource is reserved to

m

the people for their common use.

19

I have been able to ascertain, are unique among the state

20

constitutions, and no constitution contains language similar

21

to that of Alaska, and therefore the interpretation of these

22

provisions have not been resolved by any court of any state,

23

including Alaska.

The basis for our

(
Those provisions'

i

These provisions, so far as }

|

I
24

Generally there are three grounds upon which

25

abstention may be granted, and three grounds which support the j
11

1

requirement that a. District Court abstain from deciding

2

Federal questions.
first, abstention should be granted to avoid a

3
4

decision involving Federal Constitutional grounds where the

3

state law may resolve the. question.

6

applicable to this case, in that the application of the

7

exclusive right of fishery provision of the Alaska Constitution!

8

could resolve this case without the necessity of deciding the

9

Federal Constitutional question under the equal protection

10

II

This of course is
j

clause.
Also, abstention has been required to avoid needless

n

conflict with the state’s administration of its own resource

13

and its own affairs.

14

the state's police power should be the proper means to

15

regulate the resource.

18

This is in recognition of the fact that

The Appellees would assert that the Constitutional

17

provision is sc clear on its face that, it needs no further

13

interpretation, and certainly needs no interpretation in the

IS

light of the state's police power..

£0

is not true, and an example would make this point clear.

2t
22

23

Q

I would assert that this

Where is that quoted in the brief,.the

provision of the Constitution?
A

Mr. Justice, I believe it is quoted at the

24

very beginning under Constitutional Provisions on page 3.

25

have set. out the two provisions of the Alaska Constitution

12

I

I

which are involved»
Every constitution contains the requirement that no

Vt»

,

3

state shall, impair the obligation of contract.

However

this

4

Court has ruled that a state may in fact impair the

5

obligation of contract pursuant to a valid exercise of its

®

police power.

i

1 would assert that in this case, the State of
ji

7

Alaska'may create, if necessary, in the valid exercise of its

8

police power, an exclusive right of fishery.

9

which it unity do this should be determined by a court of the

10

State of Alaska, and should net have been determined by the
?
Federal District Court of Alaska.

j
The extent to
ii

!1

These provisions, as I have said, .have not. been

12
13

interpreted by any state court.

14

case of Hynes vs. Grimes Packing Company, which interpreted a

15

similar Federal statutory provision during territorial days,

IS

is determinative of this case,

17

the Secretary of the Interior had granted an exclusive right
of fishery over a particular area to a particular native

|

}

Appellees assert that the

l

However, in the Hynes case,

!

IS
19

villaoe.

There was no attempt on the part of the Secretary of

20
21

Interior to justify his granting of this right pursuant to any j
’
conservation purpose or other regulatory police power purpose.

22

In this care, of course, the State of Alaska has recognised

23

that the at .•cumulation of excessive net gear has resulted in

24

an over-harvest of fishery and has created severe management

25

and enforcement problems.

i

This is quite different from the
S
13

!
i

I

case of Hynes, where there was no regulation of this type

f»

involved«

■

i f|
Lastly, the Appellees have asserted that the industry]

3
4

of fishing is a common calling, and as such is apparently

3

immune from state regulation of this sort.

6

that industry is called a common calling does not remove, it

7

The mere fact

from state regulation, if that regulation is necessary in order!

3

to preserve; a resource, to rectify management and enforcement

3

problems with that resource.

This has been done in the past.

70

At common law, such economic pursuits as the sale of

11

in toxicati 3:>,g beverages or the transportation of people fox-

IS

hire. were considered common callings..

13

stage, these activities are heavily regulated by the states,

14

and quite often certificates of public convenience and

IS

necessity are required,

IS

especially with net gear, should be removed from state

17

regulation simply because it is connoted as being a common

IS

calling.

K9

i

j

However» at the present

There is no reason why salmon fishing

(;>

Well, is your only answer to the District

20

Court's invalidation of this statute under the Alaska

21

Constitution, is your only answer that it should not have dons

22

so, but should have deferred to the state courts, or areyou

23

asking us Co just disagree with the three judge Court on the

24

construction of the Alaska Constitution?

|

as

i

JV

Mr. Justice, I am not asking you to disagree
14

i

with the construction of the Alaska Court.

I am asking that

z

the Court should remand the case to the District Court to be

3

held pending the determination of the unique Alaska

4

Constitutional provisions in the light of Alaska law by an

3

Alaska Court,

3
7

8
9

C;

So your only answer is to defer to the state

A

Mr. Justice, one other answer would be that at

courts.

the present: stage of the record the application of the statute

SO

in the light of the Alaska Constitutional provision does not

II

necessarily reach the result that that provision is violated.,

12

I don’t believe there is enough in the present state of the

13

record to reach 'that conclusion.

14

Q

I understand that the three judge Court rested t

15

on two grounds.

One was equal protection, the 14th Amendment,

10

and one was on the Alaska Constitutione

Is that right?

17

A

Mr. Justice, that is correct,

18

0

Then if equal protection is valid, there is no

19

20
21

I

point in us; even considering the ground.
A

Mr. Justice, depending upon the position of

this Court in its application of the abstention doctrine.

First,

'

22

that doctrine has been characteristically applied in order to

23

avoid the reaching of a Federal Constitutional decision if

24

the matter could be resolved, by the application of a state

23

constitutional provision.

I
Also I would urge that the Districtj

1

Court was in error in finding the statute unconstitutional

2

under Federal Constitutional provisions.

3

0

4

h

5
6

That is a different ground» yes.

Ii
And there is nothing before the Court sufficient,

to justify its conclusion at that time.
C>

Has there been any litigation at all in the

7

state courts in Alaska of these claims or any similar claims

8

with respect to this legislation?

9

A

Mr. Justice, no.

This statute has not been

10

interpreted by an Alaska court so far as I know at any level.

11

The only litigation involving the statute has been this case;,

12

which commenced in the Federal District Court in Anchorage.

13

Again this points up my claim that since we are involved with

14

a highly complex industry, unique constitutional provisions,

15

it is appropriate for state court determination.

16

0

What decision could be made by the Alaska

17

Court on the state law to which you referred that would leave

13

the case in such a situation that you did not have to still

19

try the eqial protection question?

20

I

1.

j
|

Mr. Justice, the Alaska Court could decide,

21

although tie state would naturally fight the issue heavily in

22

the state court, but it is possible that it could reach a

23

decision that the statute is in violation of the exclusive

24

right and common privilege provisions of the Alaska

25

Cons tituticn.

i

4i'

q

That would knock the law out, wouldn't it?

V

i.

If that ware so, that would knock the entire

Kif

3

statute out;, since the provisions do no?: apply thesis elves

4

piecemeal across the statute.

5

state law, the entire statute is unconstitutional and there

6

would be nothing left to determine in the light of the Federal

7

Constitution,

If it is unconstitutional under

Of course, there would be no advantage so far

i

as this lavs' and passing it back to the state court if they
I
could hold that, would there?
A

There would certainly be no advantage to the

state if that were the conclusion of the state court,
Q

And knocked it out.

That is what the attack

on it is about.
h

This is one of the attacks.

However, Mr.

16

Justice, the state at this point is asserting that if it were

17

afforded a complete hearing at the state court level in the

18

light of the Alaska provisions that it could prove that the

18

statute is not unconstitutional to the satisfaction of the

20

state court.

21

in plenary proceedings in a state court, we could show that

22

the statute is a valid application of the state's police power •

23

under those constitutional provisions.

In other words, we feel that given a fair hearing

/

24

23

Q

You would, still leave hanging fire the question

of denial, of equal protection of the lav.
17
i

A

Under that result-, this would be possible, Mr. ;

3

Q

It would be more than possible, would it not?

4

A

That would be a fact, that if the state court

1
2

Justice.

5

resolved that the statute was constitutional, the Federal

6

question would remain for decision.

However, there have been—

Then you would have to go back to the Federal.

8

Court, would you not, or try it in the state court?

9

your theory about this?

10

A

What is

My theory on this, Mr. Justice, under the more
(

n

recent decisions of this Court, and particularly the England

12

vs. Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners, that the Federal

13

question should be reserved in the Federal Court for its

14

determination, that the state court should not determine,if
'

i
15
16

there is the abstention doctrine, the Federal provisions.
Q

Well, that is only if the plaintiffs in. the

17

Federal suit want it that way, isn't it, under England?

18

may submit it to the state court.

They

They may.

And have the Federal issue come directly to

'the state courts.

They may do this.

They are not required to do

so, if I read England correctly.
Q

But they are required to if they want to stay

in the Federal Court expressly to alert the state courts that

they want to go back to the Federal Court,

Isn't that it?

2

A

That is my understanding,

Q

I understand your argument here, Mr. Cranston,

4

in the light of what has been pointed out by Justices Black

5

and Douglas, i.e,, that the equal protection question is here, j
i

6

That was decided by the Federal District Court, and that is

7

before us now.

As I understood your argument, it is simply
i

5
I

8

on the merits of that issue that this does not violate equal
i
.

‘SO

protection, because this is economic regulation, and the Court j
‘
long since in the area of economic regulation has discarded

n

the practices of the Court of the Twenties and the Thirties to j

12

strike down economic legislation of the states under the due

13

process or equal protection clause, and that on the merits,

34

therefore, the District Court should be reversed.

15

reversed in that aspect of the case, then, and only then, only j

10

if you win on the equal protection, with respect to the other

17

horn of the case, i.e., the validity of this legislation under

18

the Alaska Constitution, that that is a matter in which there

19

should be abstention.

9

20
21

22

If it is

Isn't that your argument?

Or on the other hand are you telling us that we
should not here decide the equal protection issue?
A

Mr. Justice, I am taking the position that

23

this Court should not decide the equal protection issue since

24

there is not enough before it to decide that issue.

on that point that the record should be supplemented by further

ARGUMENT OF ROBERT BOOCHEVER, ESQ.

8
,

MR, BOOCHEVER:

9

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please

10

the Court, I believe the issues in this case, as in manv cases,|

II

may be a little clearer if we look at them in their historical

12

context.

13

regulated by the Federal Government, and back in 1926, the

14

White Act was passed pertaining to the Alaska fisheries to a

15

considerable degree.

16

Alaska,, when it was a Territory, had its fisheries

Now, Section 1 of that Act provided that there be no

17

exclusive right or special right in the fisheries of the State :

18

of Alaska, and that section was passed, and the history of it

19

shows that it was passed, with the express purpose of doing

20

j
away with some administrative orders that had existed prior to i

21

that time whereby the licensing for fishing in certain areas

22

was restricted to the prior licensee, which is basically what

23

we are confronted with in this subject litigation, a revival

24

of this old outlawed provision that was outlawed by the White

9*?.

Act back in 1926.
20

f

,

After the White Act was passed, the Secretary of

?

3

Interior at a subsequent time had in his powers the regulation j
I
of the fisheries of the then Territory of Alaska. He provided

4

for an Indian Reservation called the Karluk

5

and he provided in that same regulation that the fishing in

6

the waters abutting the Karluk Indian Reservation would be
'

7

restricted to the Karluk Indians and. their licensees.

8

other words, the Indians themselves could license third parsons

9

to fish with them in this particular area.

2

Indian Reservation

In

The matter was tried, and it came to the Supreme

10

11

Court of the United State in the case of Hynes against Grimes

12

Packing Company in 337 U„S.

13

Supreme Court held the provision limiting the right of

14

fishery in these reservation waters, even though the

13

promulgating of the regulation as far as the establishment of

16

the Indian reservation was upheld, that the Secretary could

17

not limit the fishing in those waters to the Karluk Indians

18

and their licensees because if ran afoul of the White Act

19

provision that I have just been referring to.

It was decided in 1945.

This is the background.

20

The

That decision was made in

.21

1949.

22

constitutional convention, and at that constitutional

23

convention one of the provisions that was enacted was Article

24

VIII, Section 15, and this provides for a regulation or

restriction on the regulation of fisheries almost identical

Constitutional provision, is "No exclusive right or special

privilege of fishery should be created or authorised in. the

5

The provision* and I quote from the Alaska

I would like, with your Honor's indulgence, to read

6

the comment of the Natural Resources Committee of the

7

Constitutional Convention as to why they enacted that:

3

particular Constitutional provision into the Constitution of

9

the State of Alaska.

SO

Q

Is that in your brief?

SI

h

Yes, your Honor, it is, at page 31.

12

In proposing Section 15 of the Alaska Constitution,

13

the Natural Resources Committee of the Constitutional

14

Convention made the following commentary:

13

"No exclusive right of fishery.

This section

16

is intended to serve as a substitute for the

17

provision prohibiting the several right of fisheries

18

in the White Act.

19

of that act, the purposes sought by it are given

20

expression in a prohibition of exclusive right or

21

special privileges of any person to the fisheries of

22

the state."

23

That is the Commentary on the Article on State Lands

24
25

Instead of using the terminology

and Natural Resources.
How, your Honors, this subsequently was adopted as
22

i

1

the Constitution of the State of Alaska,, this provision as a

2

part of the Constitution,, when Alaska was admitted to statehood

3

in 1959,

4

White Act provision, and the purpose of that White Act

As 1 have explained initially, this was based on the

provision was to prevent the restriction, of fishing rights to

!

5
6

7

those who had had those rights in prior years.
We have had, unfortunately, in Alaska quite a history

8

of legislative attempts that created local favoritism, efforts

9

to give the people in Alaska advantages over non-residents

10

particularly, and even as to residents in certain areas over
'

II

other areas.

12

in 282 U.S, where it was attempted to impose a $250 license

13

fee for non-resident fishermen as opposed to a $1 resident fee,,

U

and Mullaney against Anderson in 342 U.S. where they attempted j

15

a $50 non~3:esid.ent license fee as opposed to

I refer to the case of Smith against Freeman

a $5 resident feel,
J

IS

Q

Does that come into your case?

17

A

Pardon me, your Honor?

IS

Q

Does non-residency come into your case?

19

l\

Not as such, no.

This case does not depend

20

upon non-residency, because it would work a discrimination

2!

as to residents in the state as well as non-residents, in that

22

it restricts it to specific areas in the state.

23

general plan to give an advantage to the local fishermen, that

24

is, an unconstitutional advantage.

25

It is the same.-,

In Brown against Anderson the attempt was made
23

i

inhere under certain hardship conditions only fishermen of a

1

.

2

local area could fish, and no non-residents could come in to
i

S

fish.
In the last year, the case of Alaska against the

4
5

International Union of Operating Engineers, 393 U,S., involved j
'
\

8

an attempt to give local laborers of a union favoritism over­

7

non-resident labor.
It is our position, your Honors, that Chapter 186

8
9

of SLA 1963, which is the legislation with which we are here

10

concerned, comes right in this series of an effort to create

f1

a local monopoly in the fishing areas of Alaska to thosewho

1

12

had prior licenses in those particular areas.

13

understand the nature of this discrimination, I think some

14

background of the fishing processes and the nature of the

IS

licenses required is needed.

.

To better
...

I

In Alaska, any fisherman must have a commercial

16
17

fishing license.

Every fisherman must have that.

In addition,

18

where fishing is done by vessels, and far and away the large

19

amount of fishing is done by vessels, there must be a vessel

20

license.

21

commercial fishing license or the vessel license, but there is •

22

a third thing that is needed for almost all of the fishing

23

that is done in Alaska, and that is a salmon net gear license.

24

What we consider this attempt to set up a monopoly is by use

25

of that salmon net gear license.

How, there is no restriction on the issuance of the

24

The law specifies that only

!

those who are licensed in prior years in a specific area may

2

secure a salmon net gear license unless ha fishes commercially

3

for three years in that specific area.
Q

4

This does not apply to people who are

5

commercial fishermen in the sense that they are broilers, is

6

that right?

7

A

S

j

Ho, it does not.

One can troll without a

salmon net gear license.

9

Q

As a commercial fisherman.

10

ii

Yes, your Honor, and I might point out right
!

11

here that trolling is an entirely different type of fishing.

12

It uses a different type of vessel.

13

out from the vessel, only four lines are permitted —
Q

In trolling a line is hung ,

I understand, but what percentage of: salmon

less than five per cent are caught by broilers.

Ninety-five per cent are caught by the net fishermen.

Q

This

I understood it was a different variety of

salmon that was caught mainly by broilers.
A

Yes, your Honor, that is also true.

Primarily

23

the fish that are caught by trolling are the large king salmon

24

and the silver salmon, and they are not as a rule used in the

They are sent to the

This of course is the exact provision that was

involved in the Alaska Constitutional provision of Article VIII,

Section 15, which prohibited the use of the exclusive right

or special privilege in the fisheries, and which was

13

interpreted prior to the adoption of the Alaska Constitution

14

by the Supreme Court in Hynss against Grimes Packing Company,

IS

I might add that at the time that that was passed by

IS

Hynes against. Grimes Packing, we not only had a decision by

1?

the highest Court of the land, ’the Supreme Court, but at that

'13

time it was the highest Court of the state, that is, the

19

Territory, because our Territory had a District Court, which

20

was a District Court for the Territory of Alaska»

statute by the highest court of that jurisdiction.

7

We feel that not only is this violative as I have

3

shown, and clearly so with a Supreme Court decision on it

3

already of the state constitutional issues, but it also is a

10

discrimination based purely on past fishing efforts, and

?1

violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.

12

that regard, we feel that the case of Takahashi against Pish

13

and Game Commission in 334 U.S. is very much in point.

14

Honors will recall, in that case the State of California

15

prohibited fishing by certain aliens, and in expressing their

16

reason they gave very much the same reason as my learned

17

colleague here has given today, that this was a conservation

13

method, that there was too much gear in the waters of

13

California, and that it was necessary in order to conserve

20

fishing to reduce 'the amount of gear and therefore to eliminate

21

certain aliens from the fishery.

22

held that was violative of the equal protection clause, even

23

though the purpose was a justifiable purpose, assuming it was

a justifiable purpose, that of conservation,

In fact, they stated

In that case, the riverboat pilots were officers of

So I don't think the

Koch case is applicable at all to the situation which we have.
C:

At least you do have asserted here the interest

12

of Alaska in having only people fish who are familiar with the

13

waters, with the notices, with the weather, with the bottom,

14

with the safety, and having experience, which you did not, as

15

I remember, have in the California case.

IQ

A

Am I right in that?

Yes, that is so, your Honor.

However, in this

17

subject case, what there is in the recitation of the statute,

18

there is a statement that experience plays a part in

1.3

management, in safety and in lav; enforcement, and we served

20

interrogatories on the state requesting any examples they

21

could give where this was a factor, experience, I might add, in

22

the particular area, because the plaintiffs in tjhis case are

23

all experienced fishermen who have fished a great deal, but
i

24
23

they have teen denied the right to fish in the particular area. j

Alaska, where that one area is as large as all of the New

there each fish in their ax^n little favorite harbors, and

the rest of the area, just the same as their experience in

arguing that point.

Assuming that it is, in this particular

case, they should not exclude, based on the past right,, and

3

then leave it in the hands of those who have that exclusive

4

right to decide who will come in, because no one can fish

5

without fishing with the gear licensees.

Incidentally, your Honors asked as to what ~~

7

()

You mean they won't fish.

No, your Honor; what I mean is that in order

to fish, they have to get the consent of one of the gear

Of course, you can fish.

catching other fish besides salmon?

What about Bristol Bay?

A

In Bristol Bay, to my knowledge, the salmon

fishery would be the only fishery, but I could not say that

categorically.

That is my impression.

t

If you can't say it categorically,, the state;

is saying co ahead and fish commercially, learn about the area,

learn about, the water and the other characteristics, how to

handle the boat.

6

maintain yourself on the ocean safely, and obey the law.

7

Isn't that enough for the state?

Maybe you won't learn much about salmon

S

7.

No, in my opinion it is not, your Honor.

9

I know it is not in your opinion, but it is

10

only because you disagree with the substantive judgment of the

1!

state.

13
14
15
?6

17
13
10
20

h

No, my feeling would be that if you have a man

who has fished commercially in one area, and he has shown his
knowledge and has fished there, there is .no reason why he should
be discriminated against in fishing in another area whereby
his only means of entering that field is by the grace of the
licensee, or else he is subjected to leaving his vessel, his
gear, and to try to gain employment there, or else to do, as
in the case of the salmon fishery in Bristol Bay, a futile
act for three years.

21

Q

I suppose you would concede that the state

22
has the right to limit the number of people who can fish in
23
24
25

any area.
A

No, I do not, your Honor, not under the

State Constitutional provision.

Isn't this regulation an indirect way of

Of limiting the number of fishermen?

Yes,

12

your Honor, it did limit the number of fishermen, but by an

1.3

unconstitutional way.

14

:: would like to answer Mr. Justice White further, if

15

I may.

17

are permissible.

25

With reference to the regulation under the State

They may reduce the number of hours that

that is permitted.

They may reduce the size of the gear

But they can net create an exclusive or

special right in certain people to fish in the areas..

This is ;

what they have attempted to do here, and in our opinion is a
clear violation.
q

What is the issue?

Certainly they can't

establish an exclusive right in certain people, if those

Yes, your Honor.

So I

Don * t these questions , which have been bringing-

out a lot cf factual matters, suggest that this is a subject

20

which ought to be explored in a full scale evidentiary process?

No, your Honor, because most of the facts which

22

I have stated are matters that are so well known in Alaska thatj

they are a matter of judicial knowledge.

But not well known to us.

It is difficult, I must admit, to talk to
