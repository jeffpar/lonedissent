ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELEANOR JACKSON PIXEL; ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MRS. PIEL:

issues for decision.

Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the

The case before you today presents three important
The first is whether, when a person —

10

whether a person who enters a Kress

who entered a Kress

11

restaurant lunch counter in 1954, August 14th in Hattiesburg,

12

Mississippi — whether she was denied her privileges and

13

amenities as a citizen under 1983 U.S.C. Section 42, as the

14

result of the action of law or the action of custom and usage £
Now, this case is interesting because it was a

15

16

waitress who put the gloss

17

Rights Act of 1964 when she said to the Petitioner when she

18

went in accompanied by six black children to this restaurant:

19

"We have to serve the colored, but we don't have to serve the

20

white who come in with them.

21

Honors have before you of this v/aiteess in Mississippi that was

22

affirmed by the District Court below and also by the Court of

23

Appeals.

24
25

Q

on the situation and on the Civil

Now, it’s this gloss that Your

Does the record show whether this was -- or

whether she consulted the management ox* she purported to act
2

1

under instructions from the manager?

2

A

The record does so show.

3

Q

It does show?

4

A

In fact, there are two parts of the record.

S

One is a deposition record which becomes relevant on the second

6

issue which I'm just about to describe, and then the other is

7

the record of the trial which only goes as far as the Plain­

8

tiff's case, because at the -end of the Plaintiff's case the

9

District Court granted a directed verdict.

10

Now, the second important issue is whether or not

n

the Trial Court was justified in granting a summary judgment

\z

against a cause of action charging that the Respondent con­

13

spired with the Hattiesburg Police Department in this action,

14

depriving the Petitioner of service and then later securing the

15

arrest of the Petitioner for vagrancy and on the instant she

16

left the Kress store.

17

Now, previous to the Petitioner and the six children

18

going into the Kress store in Hattiesburg in 1964, they had all

19

been to the Hattiesburg Public Library and there they asked to

20

use the services of the library and they were told that they

21

were not permitted to use those services; the Chief of Police

22

was called; they were asked to leave the library and the library

23

was closed.

24
25

The third issue before Your Honors this morning is
whether or not the Civil Rights Act of 1875, declared
3

i

unconstitutional by this Court in 1383 by the civil rights

2

cases, should not be revived and whether, under these circum-

3

stances, the Petitioner had a right to ask for $500 statutory

4

damages for her deprivation of the full enjoyment of the

5

privileges of an inn or another place of public amusement.

6
7

8
9

Those are the three questions which I propose to
discuss this morning.,
Wow, as to the first issue, Judge Bonsai, the
District Court Judge, in a preliminary ruling, hobbled the

10

entire case by the ruling as follows:• He said that the

11

Petitioner in this case would have toprove at trial that there

12

was a custom in Mississippi of not serving white persons when

18

serving Negroes.

He then said that that custom would have to

14

be shown at trial to be enforced bythe state and he said,

15

-pursuant to the provisions of the Mississippi Code, Sec.2056.5,

16
17

m
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

which was passed in 1957, two years after the Brown decision,
which said that a proprietor may choose the customers he wishes
and that if the customer, having been asked to leave and not
having chosen to, refuses to leave, a trespass

a criminal

action for trespass would lie against him.
Now, he also said that this is not too relevant here,;
that we would have to show that the proprietor knew of this
section of the law in order to make out a case.
Now, this ruling ignored the clear state of
Mississippi law at that time.

4

It ignored the fact that

1

following the Brown decision, Mississippi passed a number of

2

laws»

3

upon all of the agencies of the government to regard the law

4

stated by this Court in the Brown decisions of 1954 to be

5

inapplicable to the State of Mississippi.

6

It had a

resolution of interposition" which it called

In 1954 it passed a conspiracy law which said that

7

it would be a crime to violate the segregation laws of the

3

State of Mississippi. In 1956 it also passed a law; forty-four

9

thousand and something which required the Executive Branch of

10

the Government to enforce the segregation laws of the State of

n

Mississippi.

12

have just described.

It also passed at that time the trespass law I

14

of the state legislative policy of Mississippi was relevant to

this case, nor did the Court below, which dismissed all the
other legislative actions of the State of Mississippi as having
to do with school desegregation, despite the clear language of
the Mississippi statutes which speak of segregation in all
public places to be the policy of the state of Mississippi.
The other aspect of Judge Bonsai's error was that he
read into the language of 1983 which clearly states in the
alternative that every person who denies a person, the privileges
and immunities of citizenship, under color of statute, regula­
tion, ordinance, custom or usage, is liable to that parson for
damages, or other appropriate relief.

9

As pointed out quite eloquently in Judge Waterman's

10

dissent, it would be impossible to show a long-standing policy

11

of serving Negroes and not serving the whites that accompanied

12

them, in a state that, did not serve Negroes, except separately,

13

starting back with the decision of this Court in Plessy against

14

Ferguson.

15

as the lav; of the land and that this Court stated it; the South

16

and sometimes the North have followed that custom for many

17

years; and it was only in .1954 when this Court spoke out and

18

said that that custom is no longer acceptable, that changes

19

commenced.

20

have always been going on, but we really had the law of the lane

21

changed.

We have the statement of that custom as acceptable

1 shouldn't say that changes commenced — changes

The custom was testified to by the Plaintiff at. the

22

2S

trial.

There was evidence in the trial record that the custom

24

of the mixing of the races was not acceptable in Hattiesburg,

25

Mississippi.

Moreover, this custom was vividly described by the

6

1

Fifth Circuit in a case called the United States against The

2

City of Jackson, one year before this incident, when the Court

3

said: "We again take judicial notice thfet ~he State of

Mississippi has a steel bar, inflexible, undeviating, official

There is nothing in the record as to that,

except that there is a policy statement in the affidavit presen

for summary judgment; there is a policy

statement of Kress which you wjll find in the Appendix, which,

8

1

interestingly enough, says that as of July 15fch, already 13

days after the Civil Rights Act went into effect, and it says:

3

"You will no longer segregate your facilities"and then it says

4

"and you must stop having segregated washrooms and segregated

drinking fountains; and you must look and take down any signs

races.

Now, as to that I have fcobe a little more technical.

Justice Marshall,, in a recent case has set down that when a

4

summary judgment is appropriate — and I believe that this case

S

is an outstanding example of when summary judgment is not

6

appropriate.

there was a conspiracy between the officials of the Police

Department of the City of Hattiesburg and Kress.

The charge in the Plaintiff's Complaint was that

In support cf

certain affidavits? brought in one by the police commissioner
which reminds me of the old law school saying of what is a
negative pregnant, because it does not deny that the police had
nothing to do with Kress'a conduct.

He says quite specifically

that he talked to Mr. Powell, the Manager, about Miss Adickes'
arrest.
Mr. Powell furnished evidence in his deposition,
which I think suggests that conspiracy? in fact, suggests the
whole line of thought.

He says that after the passage of the

Civil Rights Bill and the things that were going on in
Hattiesburg he thoughta lot about people coming into Kress in
mixed groups and he decided he was going to have a policy and
that policy was going to be that under certain circumstances
not to serve white persons in the group.
Now, I submit that: this policy could well be one that
was discussed and worked out with the Police Department of the

10

1

City of Hattiesburg.

2

Q

You say, "could well be»"

3

A

Yes.

4

Q

Of course, that's a difficult standard on which

5

Yes, but we are not finding? we are talking

7

about whether or not this Respondent presented us with enough

8

facts for a prima facie case.

Q

Whether we have a genuine issue of fact, that’s

the test; isn't it?
A

Yes.

And the genuine issue of fact arises here

12

out of the circumstances just as they are set forth.

had an active role inthis library refusal; the police arrested

14

her immediately after she has been deprived of service in this

explains that he communicates with people by eye signals,

17

Had the District Court found that fact first?

1

Then,, finally, and 1 don’t think this is an

2

unimportant aspect of the conspiracy case, I submit to Your

3

Honors that the custom of segregation shared and supported by

4

the police; the custom in Hattiesburg, where it was supported

5

by private persons representing a conspiracy between the law

6

enforcement officer and the private person, embracing the

7

doctrine of segregation.

waswhat was happening and that's what occurred in this case.

That you have a — besides an expressed conspiracy, you have a

silent conspiracy, which you can look for -the support to of the

11

events as they occurred.

12

Q

Of course, if you prevail on the first branch

13

of your case, the conspiracy matter is quite unimportant to

14

you; isn't it?

15

A

Did you say it was unimportant to me?

IS

Q

Yes, if you prevail on the first branch of your

17

case; if this was done, absent conspiracy, under color of law;

13

under color of custom; don't you prevail in this case?

19

A

Surely; surely.

20

Q

Irrespective of the conspiracy charge.

21

A

Yes, but if I had a stronger case with the

Now, there you have — still in answer to your
question, because there you have affirmative stats action, at

rule and I am now going to take issue with the Williams-Hot
Shop statement of what the common law was in Virginia, and
state that my understanding of the common law in the southern
states at the time of the passage of 'the 14th Amendment is that
an inn or other victualer, which means a restaurant, has an
obligation to serve all persono who come in.

interpretation that is found in the old common law and which

No, Your Honor.

As I understand it, what

happened was that the Plaintiff filed a petition for removal

as to the Federal Court.

up at the Court of Appeals.

4

for this Petitioner to rely upon that case as some support in

this case, is really unwarranted.

6

The facts are twofold:

of course, Kress was not a party to that case; we didn't even

13

know about it; we didn't go in and cross-examine or find out,.

14

Moreover,

You see, the Court there said that the arrest was

15

related, to her activities in Kress; which may be true.

that3s why the police did arrest her, but that doesn’t mean

that Kress had anything to do with the arrest.

Q

Now, that's the United States Court of Appeals

that said that?

Yes, sir.

Q

I just want to get the factual answers to my

23

question, if I may.

She was arrested a few moments after

m

leaving the store, on a charge of vagrancy,

was brought in the State Court the petition fox- removal to the

the Defendant petition to remand to the State Court after the

5

removal.

6

Q

And that was denied?

7

A

No.

I believe that was granted by the District

S

Court.

Then Plaintiff appealed and they reversed that and said

9

it was properly removed and the case should be dismissed.

10

Q

And then the case was then dismissed?

11

A

Yes.

12

Q

In the Lower Court?

13

A

Yes; that is correct.

U

Q

I believe so.

Well, does the record show there was any

commotion or disturbance outside the store when she was

16

arrested?

20
21

22

A

There is testimony to that effect; yes, sir.

The store manager testified to that.
Q

I know, but what is the fact.

He testified to

it, but was there any evidence of a disturbance?
A

Well, I think it is fair to say that is the onlj

evidence in the record on it; yes.
Q

That’s what I was asking you.

A

Yes, that is the only evidence on the point.

How, we think that when we. came forward with these

And that is the question as to whether or not Kress
is liable under Section 1383 for the refusal to serve her in
their store on August 14, 1964.

We contend that it is not

liable under that statute, because there was, in fact, no state
action; that all we have here, at most,
by a private restauranteur to serve.

is a private refusal

This is not a case under

the 1964 Act, which Plaintiff possibly could have brought and

28

1

need only have proven interstate commerce and a refusal for

2

racial grounds? and could have gotten an injunction.

But,

Plaintiff didn't do that? she brought a case under 1983, seeking

4

more than half a million dollars in damages; and that requires

5

state action, as all the Courts below have unanimoualy held.

6

Now, Petitioner, in order to satisfy that element,

has attempted to point to certain Mississippi statutes and an

alleged custom.

points I would like tomake on that.

Q

Let's assume we were talking about a public
Would this be a law which might indicate to

people that mixing of the races in waiting rooms was illegal in
Mississippi?
A

I think it might so indicate.

23

I think the

statute, as Your Honor knows, calls upon the State Officers to
prevent integration by fhe Federal Government in these speci­
fied placesp and it's limitedto that»

Integration by the

Federal Government in these specified places.

Of course, this

doesn’t involve the Federal Government and doesn’t involve any
of these places.
More importantly, Your Honor, if I may suggest,
this resolution and this statute — and this presents a very
basic question — was passed in 195S by the Legislature of the
State of Mississippi.

We are not dealing as the Court has with

somany cases wtih the constitutionality of a prosecution by
the state for a criminal trespassing and the Court points to
that statute and says, "Yes, but the existence of that statute
should bar the state from prosecuting."

We are talking about

holding a private citizen liable for monetary damages.

What

What we have here is a resolution or an act passed
eight years prior to the event in question.

This doesn't relate

to restaurants such as Kress? there is no proof — indeed, the
proof is to the contrary that Kress even knew of it.

It

clearly didn't participatein the passage of it and to seek to
brand Kress with liability on the mare existence of the statute,

1

which is what Petitioner alleges, would set up- a rule of law
whereby liability would depend, not upon what you did, but where
you did it.

Because, if the state had, sometime in the past

passed some legislation or had a history a hundred years ago,
30

i

then you then would he saddled with that.

2

Now, here we have a store, and it is conceded in the

would say further that she had proven no state statute that we

Well, now suppose that was out.

What I’m

getting at is: do you have the ordinary grounds to support an
argument that the directed verdict was wrong plainly on the
34

issue there was no evidence to prove her case?

2

A

Beyond the grounds I stated, Mr. Justice

Black, no? 1 think she just failed to prove the case because

she failed to prove all of those elements.

We did refuse her service; there's

no doubt about that.

contended below that it was not for the reasons that she

suggested and it was not because cf her race or color and it

was not pursuant to any state custom or ordinance.

However, we vigorously contend and have

Well, what do you claim the record shows about

that as to why it was done?
35

A

1

Well j, I think that I would have to concede

2

that the only testimony since Plaintiff’s case has gone in,

3

was the statement that Plaintiff proffered that we refused her

4

service because of the fact that she was a white person in the

5

company of Negro childrens and that is her testimony.
Q

6

Mr. Lifcvack, do you see any state action in the

1

fact that as soon as she left Kress's she was arrested by the

8

police for a charge that they themselves, didn’t feel inclined

9

to defend?
A

10

Not state action, Mr, Justice Marshall»

11

sufficient to hold Kress li'&bla if we didn't call the police,

12

and had nothing to do with the police.

by a policeman could possibly be state

action«
A

I think — I may be confused on the law? but

my understanding of it is: yes, there would be an act by the
state for which the state may have acted properly or improperly
But that the issue under Section 1383 is that Kress acted under
color of law.
Q

Well, don't you think it was a jury question to

find out whether or not Kress did have anything to do with it?

No, Your Honor, because the fact that. all.

A

I apoligize.

I didn't mean to do that.

Well, I mean at that stage you still say it is

That’s your whole point: it is not enough to go

On the conspiracy; yes, Your Honor? really.

What about the —

A

Well, the other wasn't enough to go to the

jury, either; yes.
Q

That is true; that is true.

Well, do you stand on fee points *— do you

rest on the point that there is no evidence in this record
after all the evidence was in, that the state has acted in concert with the Kress employees or that the Kress employees had
acted in concert in any way with the police.

Is that the gap

that you see in this?
A

I see two gaps, Mr. Chief Justice.

gap that you mentioned.

First, the.

Yes, there is no evidence, and indeed,

everything is to the contrary that Kress had any nexus with the
police or any of its actions.
And second, and once that is accepted, then the
mere existenceof the statutes to which Plaintiff pointed, are
not sufficient here, just as they ware not sufficient in the
Williams case, to constitute state action so as toiaake Kress
liable.
And those are the two points on which we rested
for that proposition.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

So, your position is that

under Section 1983 the burden of proof is on the Plaintiff to
38

3

show that tha action — the state action in question and the

2

private action were interrelated and the result of cooperation

3

of some kind or exchange of information?
A

4

Yes, I say in order for a private person to be

liable there must be some nexus with the state»

S

The existence

6

of the statutes, by themselves, do not give rise to liability,

7

and therefore, they must show some conspiracy or interaction
between them, sufficient to hold us liable under Section 1983.

8

I would like tocomment briefly, if I may, on the

9
1875 Act,

JO

That is a point which Petitioner raised in the

District Court on a cross-motion when we moved for summary

II

judgment.

12

She moved to be permitted to amend her Complaint

to add a claim under the Civil Rights Act of 1075, which of

13

course, this Court had previously declared unconstitutional.

14

That motion was denied in motion part by the District Judge.

15

Thereafter, the point was never raised again in the District

IS

Court? never raised in the Trial Court? and never raised in the

17

Court of Appeals.

18

We, therefore, suggest respectfully to this Court

19

that that issue was not properly before it and should not be

£0

considered.

21

Moreoever, the fact is that on the face of the

22

statute, it would have no application to a restaurant such as

23

Kress, anyway and as the authority upon which Plaintiff herself

24

relies, namely: tha Miramar Columbia Law Review, it itself notes

25

33
,i

t

that the .restaurants such as Kress would most likely not be

2

covered.

3

unconstitutionality of this Act was made in 1883 and the

4

Congress-has not seen fit to reenact it or revive it, and has

5

since passed the 1964 Act which was broader in its application

6

in many ways.

This is particularly true, because the decisionof

'

- •

I think, therefore, under all the circumstances,

7
8

this Court should not now seek to reenact or revive legislation

9

for which the Congress has not dene so.
Q

10

Mr. Lifcvak, could I ask you:

Let's assume that

11

a local custom had been true -- 1 don’t know what you think a

12

custom is, but could one have been proved ■— no statute at all?

13

just the custom.
A

14

IS
m

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Justice White.

Well, 1983 talks about customs? doesn't it?
I think it talks about State customs, Mr.
State customs -— in other words, my reading the

statute 33 as a state statute, law ordinance, or state custom.
And when custom was defined in the 1964 Act Congress defined
custom as something which is required arid enforced by the state
and 1 think that, as we say in our brief, is a restatement of
the Congressional intent behind the Act when it was first
passed.

Q

Well, couldn't it be said that you —

Q

Would you say that if you are wrong on that

interpretation of 1983 you lose this case?

A

Ho, Your Honor? I would not.

40

Q
at all.

The Court of Appeals .no custom had been proved

Is it failure of proof to prove any custom, whether

it was enforced by the state or not?
A

Right.

I think correctly so.

The Court of Appeals did say that and
I think, and we have always contended

that you have to put the state in the custom, just like you do
in the statute or anything else.

It must be a state custom.

I believe the Court of Appeals merely says, and I think
correctly so, that no custom was proven with that regard to the
state.
Q

They didn't reach the question of whether it

had to be state enforced?
A

Ho.

In fact, as Your Honor will note, they

indicated that — well, they didn't indicate really --- I was
thinking of another point on which they had some indication —
no; they did not reach that question.
Q

However,

They just said there had been a failure to prove

any kind of a custom?
A

Right.

We had urged infcha District Court and the

Court of Appeals that it must be a state custom.
Q

What do you mean by state' custom?

A

A custom which somehow, in one of its manifes­

tations, involves the state, either by enforcing it; directing
it; encouraging it —just like in —

say about that?

I’d say if all they proved is that everyone

Not a custom of the people to refrain from

enforcing the laws, is it?
A

14

No.

If yon can bring the state into it through

15

its enforcement mechanisms, I agree you would probably have

16

a state-enforced custom.

17

But customs of the people, as the

Court said in Williams against Hot Shop and Williams against

13

Howard Johnson, the customs of the people is not state action.

19

They do not constitute state action.
Q

20
21

That is our position.

What do you do when the police uniformly

enforce the custom by vagrancy statute?
A

22

Yes.

I think the proof here is that was not

23

so.

Ir. other words, Kress had served Negroes and whites at

24

lunch counter facilities from July 2nd up until the day in

If it had been an enforced custom they couldn't have

that the police give it muscle?

Well, he was not referring to restaurants.

It was a decision of 1963, prior to passage of the 1964 Act.

I dont think that this Court should or would presume that the

would continue, even if it had in the past, not integrated its
