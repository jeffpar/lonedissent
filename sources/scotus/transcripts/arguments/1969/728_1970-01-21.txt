Petitionei:

was brought back into cuatody on that date and on that date an
arrai~nment was held and he was ordered to trial on that
Friday, but over objection of counsel, trial was continued
until ;January 31, 1968.
On January 30, 1.968 the Petitioner filed two

The State, in ;:in ex

motions.

The first motion ~as a motion for continuance, based

upon the factsthat te was unable to locate two defense witnesses: one by the name of Dolan, who woul1 have cooperated
certain testimony that he had been in th~ place that had been
robbed and another ty the name of Strickland, who would have
testified that on tre niqht tha·t the robbery occurred in
Florida that the Petitioner was in Waycross, Georgia.
The Court granced l:he motion for continuance and on
the same day the Petitioner filed a motion to quash the information, based upon the fact chat he had. been denied the rl.ght
to speedy trial.

Tt e Court \Ji thheld ruling on this motion.

He also filed with ':he motion an affidavit stating that one of
his witnesses had d ..ed in 1964.

The court then continued the

trial of the case u11til February 13, 1968.
On Februa::y 12, 1968 the Petitioner then filed

,,

another mot~on for continuance, ba-~d upon the fact that One

Durinq the course of the trial the deputy

sheriff who testifie-.l for the State, testified that he 1ad
destroyed the notes ;hat he had taken down in connection with
the description give.1 to him by the victim ~,hen the robbery had
occurred, which brin 1s us to the content5.on in this case.

Now, the S;ace's contention is in tilis case that:
(1) they gave the Pe.itioner a speedy trial, and (2) there was

no prejudice to the defense.
5

It is our oosit5.on that there was a prejt1dice to the

2

defense because of tne eight year delay, because a witness was

unavailable to support tne Petitioner's contention, and

that a witness had died, and (4) that vital evidence had been

A

Even 1f the defendant is in the jurisdiction,

Florida.

because the defendant then has the availability of Florida
Statute 915.0l and .02, which gives him the right to demand
trial and push the case along.

Well, then, in the ordinary case, within

This would be a little di ffer:ent

tow, Florida had not -- this case went to

the Florida Supreme Court.

Florida had never ruled until the

Dickey case went to the Florida Supreme Co~rt, of whether the
State had a constitutione.l duty to bring an individual back
from another'£tate wto was in some type of custody.

In Dickey

v. the Circuit Court of Gadsden County, which is cited in the
brief, the Florida St,preme Court held that the State had the
constitutional duty t.o bring an ir,dividual back to Florida..
Q

..

Isn't it true that they bring them back to the

nearest Fede;:al peni t.entiar.y?

The Federal Government does;

brings them as close to the county as possible and then lets th
8

1

county come pick him up?

2

A

Yes, ~ir; thar i~ c1rrect.

Q

And t1at could nave been done

4

A

That ::ould have been done here, ev~n without the

5

decision in Dickey v. the First Circujt Court of Gadsden County,

6

yes, sir.

1

Now, discuJsinc the quest:i.on of prejudice in this

8

case we have ,1ot dwelt on this in any length, because I thinl·

9

the decisions are e,p larent ::o this Court.

There is, on paqes

10

17 and 18 of our bri 3f tl-.cre are a null1ber of decisions where

11

there is shown prejulice tothe defense.

22
23
24

25

Another ar,urnent may be made that, assl.lJ'ning that all
witnesses were prese1t, would this still have been prejudicial
in this case?

We co1tend it would have.

We contend that any

time there is a leng;hy delay that the quilt determination process is eroded, simp.ly by virtue of the fact that witnesses
forget as tha years pass what they are supposed to remember in
order to testify to.
And, obvio·1sly, the right of cross-examination is
lost to the defendan:.

'l'he trial itself, literally becomes a

mockery, because the witnesses cannot recall events that happened many years ago
Now, in th<! case of Klopfer versus North Carolina,
which was decided by this Court, the commentators have said
that there has been

110

prejudice discus::ied in this case, but we
0

1

do note 1:hat as notej by th;.s Cour .. in Klopfer that the delay

2

which an accused is 3ubjectetl to tllat hie movement, freedom

3

of movement is curtailed, the suspicion that he conllllitted the

4

crime, that the

s

trial; and that thes~ facto.:s are

6

to i:ho·.., t.hat there was prejudice i,, tlni.: case to Mr, Dickey.

7

New, I would like to poi.1t out that the Hespcndent

COll'Jr..mit"r

L; actually interested in an early

ui:ficient, among the ot:,ers

8

claims that the Petitioner Dickey did not comply with tre

9

Florida statutes.

Fl.orid,, has on its bocks, 91501 and 91502.

10

In 91501 if a person :i.s f:!"eed and he can demand trial in three

t1

terms of court and if he complies with these statutory regula-

12

tions. and he is not ::>rought to triaj_ witrin three terms of

13

court then he -- tee charge is dismissed completely and forever

14

barred.

15

New, 91502 says the same thing except for a person

16

who is in custody.

'\ow, the State cf Florida contends that the

17

Petitioner never corn;::lied with these statutes, and we will

18

agree with that; there is no argur.~ent.

t9

point out t,:, this Co.i.rt that when the Petitioner filed his

20

written demand with the cou~t having jurisdiction, the first

21

time it was late.

22

right on time but the court then said "W~ have no autho1.iL-y to

23

But I would like to

So, I don't .:hinlc the argu. i::int that he failed to comply

5

A

Yes, ,ir; we're con<;ending that. there was no

(l

waiver here on the pirt of the Peti·~ioner because he filed his

written de,1,and.s, eve 1 though he didn't track the Florid<'

8

statutes.

9

We are als) co:itending -·· the State is contending

to

thathe got a speedy ;rial; we're saying ~hat an eight-year

We're saying that the factors in

prejudice in extre'llf'ly long delays, even assuming that every

Since we have got the fact,

t1

12

bringing him back fo1 trial.

Did Florida try ~o do it and

No, tl ey did not.

They made no attempt uhatco-

l

ever to secure hil. r,:_t:urn •mt:~l afto?l.' the decision in Dickey,
rendered by ':h1= Flo:n.da Supreme Co1,~t.
that time Mr. Oickey peti cic,n'1d on

.J.

~'.one whatsoever.

At

,nandamue proceeding to say,

"Look: 'llake it or mi!'s; eitt.er get me back down there and try
me, or get this det,.iner off my bac'.; so that I can get parole
from. the Federal autl.ori ti.:!s."

No,-,, that's the posture in whic

he put his pleadings and in light thereof, they issued their
opinion which is a p,rt of the record here.
On that occnsion, Mr. Ho?kins, th~ State Attorney,
secured an order to t,ve Mr. Dickey returned fo~ purposes of
trial.

Ile was brouqht back and, as Mr. Buchanan explained, the
15

t

results that followca did follow.

2

Now, en the "ir&t occasion when an attempt was made

3

'1-•ith the Federal authc,rities to get him back, they cor.1plied

4

and we did get him ba :k, trled ana convicted him, and he sits
in Raiford.

9

Until you did, all that can be said is the Sixth sat there

10

until you decided it was going to be applied to the states,

1t

through the 14th.
Now, I don't mean to be evasive, but that's what I

12
13

understand you did in Klopfer.
Now, if he didn't meet Florida's requirements at a

15

16
17
18

That gave a complaining individual a right to come to

time when he could have ano secured his reJ.ease, and didn't
have the option of doing it under Klopfer, because all of his
moves had been made by then, and I submit that our court was
not in error and his demand for a speedy trial was made at a
time when he had no assurimoo without compliance with the state

2.0
21

law or guarantee under the Federal that he was going to get it
simply by the pASsage of tine.
Q

one other point: the judge never mentioned the

fact that this piece of paper didn't coMply with the law, did
he?

the Court spoke in Klopfer,

2

A

Tha - 's correct, at t.he Federal level.

Now, in

3

order for him to have a righ~ to cor~plain about a Federally-

4

assured right to a sp,Jedy trial, I contend Klopfer first put i

5

into effect.

6

If we go back to i,'lorida' s til'le, then he didn' t compl ,

7

comply with 915.02 and the court so stated in Dickey and just

8

as soon as they said, "Now is the til'le, Mr. Hopkins, for you

9

to move,"he did move, and he got. hirn back.

10

And 55 days later

he was tried.
But about the prohibition, I can't stress that

11

12

strongly.

If it was a fact that thil3 man was not going to be

13

stuck with flagging memo~ies or anythinq like that, why tlidn't

he bring prohibition, which is available to him.

Klopfer.

But t:iat 'las after Klopfer.

Oh, yes.

Well, all I'm suggesting is that your arqument

leaves out one very iMportant factor, and that is the due
process right that this man had to a speedy trial or some kind
of a trial in the state courts, independently of Klopfer.

Yes, he did.
