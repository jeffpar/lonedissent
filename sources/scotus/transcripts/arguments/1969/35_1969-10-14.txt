ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD GLADSTEIN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Number 35, Bryson against

MR. GLADSTEIN:

Thank you. Your Honor.

May it

please the Court*, this case brings into question the Constitu­

io

tionality of Section 9(h) of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947.

11

That provided, in substance, that before a labor union could

12

resort to the facilities of the National Labor Relations Board,

13

each of its offices must annually sign and file a non-communist

14

affidavit.

1950 in the case of the American Communications Association

18

against Douds.

17

Vinson, in which two other members of the Court concurred.

18

Justices Frankfurter and Jackson wrote separate opinions, con­

19

curring in part, and dissenting in part.

20

The constitutionality of that statute was upheld in

The chief opinion was written by Chief Justice

Mr. Justice Black dissented on a number of grounds,

21

including explicitly an expression of his view that Section 9(h

22

was a bill of attainder and therefore violated Article I,

23

Section 9 of the Constitution.

24
25

The Congress, it appears was not satisfiedwith its
experience under Section 9(h) and twelve years after its
2

?

passage, nine years after this Court was persuaded to sustain

2

it, the Congress repealed that law and replaced it with Section

3

504 of the Labor-Management Relations Act.

4

vided that it was a crime for a man simultaneously to hold

5

union office and to be a member of the Communist Party,

statute was held unconstitutional by this Court in the United

7

States against. Archie Brown, 1965.

That section pro­

That

In an opinion written by the Chief Justice, four
other members of the Court concurring in the opinion, on the
express grounds that Section 504 was an unconstitutional bill
of attainder.
One of the questions certified in this case, is
whether, in the comparative light of the American Communications
Association versus Douds and the United States versus Brown,
Section 9(h) is constitutional.

Let me say a few words about

the background of this case in order to put the other two cer­
tified questions in perspective.
The petition here was one time the president of a
small maritime labor union, numbering some 3,000 members.

He

served on vessels plying in and out of the Pacific Coast ports
in the steward's department of those ships.
In 1951 he signed and filed the affidavit which was
required at the time under the Taft-Hartley Law., The union
was, and had been for some time, engaged in a bitter juris­
dictional dispute, which ultimately led to the dissolution of
3

1

2

the organisation itself»
Now, the affidavit that he filed was in printed

3

form that -the Labor Board supplied and it recited three basic

4

things? it recited that the affiant at the time that he signed»

5

did not then support any organisation that advocated the over­

6

throw of the Government by force* violence or other unconstitu-

7

tional or illegal means.

8

not a member of the Communist Party* specifically naming the

9

Communsc Party in the second portion.

10

11

\

It provided second* that he said he

It provided third* that

he was not then affiliated with the. Communist Party.
In 1954* almost three years after the filing of the

12

1951 affidavit* although I should state that in 1952 Bryson

13

filed the affidavit? he did the same thing in 1953 and again in

14

1954P if my memory serves me correctly* even after he was

15

indicted on the 1951 affidavit.

16

He was charged in the indictment with three counts

17

of violations? all three* of course* all three of the portions

18

that I mentioned.

19

the count: that charged him with supporting an organisation that

20

advocated the over-throw of the Government.

21

the counts concerning membership? and concerning affiliation.

22

The jury returned the verdict* holding— I should

23

Prior to the trial* the Government dismissed

He went to trial on

say that this was brought under the False Statements Statute

24

which is set forth in our brief and in the position.

25

returned a verdict holding that when he swore that he was net
4

They

1

then a member of the Communist Party, he was not falsely swear­

2

ing*

3

On the' other hand, it returned a verdict holding

4

that he did violate the law when he swore that he had not been

5

affiliated with the Communist Party,

6

five years in prison at a fine of $10,000, which was the

7

maximum, and in addition, the trial judge provided expressly

8

that he was subject to further imprisonment in the event that

9

he failed to pay the fine*

Bryson was sentenced to

He served nearly two years of his term and then '

10

n

was paroled.

12

$2,000 of the $10,000 fine, but there is a balance of $8,000.

13

Shortly before we filed a petition in- the District

In the intervening years he has managed to pay

14

Court that connects the proceedings that are now here, the

15

Government noticed the taking of Bryson's deposition in the

16

original criminal proceedings and did take his deposition,

17

seeking assets for the purpose of enforcing the collection of

18

the $8,000 balance.

19

criminal action in the Federal District Court in San Francisco

20

seeking judgment for the $8,000.
A

21

And thereafter, the Government filed a

week or two after that, Bryson's petition was

22

filed with the District Court seeking a writ of error coram

23

nobis or relief under the other applicable post-conviction

24

statutes.

25

One of the basic grounds upon which that relief was

sought was the allegation that under United States versus Brown
5

1

the constitutional basis of Section 9(h) had been eroded, along

2

without being confirmed? that it should be controlled by the

3

decision of this Court in United States against Brown and

4

therefore, the Petitioner’s original conviction had been un­

5

constitutional.

6

all aspects except not granting a prayer for the return of the

7

$2,000 which Bryson paid to the Government on his fine.
The Government took an appeal to the Court of

3
9

The District Judge granted the petition in

Appeals end that Court, in returning a decision, reversed,

10

holding that Bryson was precluded from brining his petition by

1!

reason of a petition of this Court in Dennis versus the United

12

States,

13

review a challenge against the constitutionality of Section

14

9(h) on the ground that the petitioners in that case were shown

15

to have been engaged in a conspiracy to deceive and to defraud

16

the Government and therefore, that they had lost standing.

17

That case ’was a case in which this Court declined to

The Court of Appeals, holding that Dennis presented

18

an insuperable obstacle to us, declined to pass on the other

13

questions and did reverse.

20
21

22

24
25

The other two questions presented and certified here,
then, ares one, whether the petitioner.is precluded by reason
of this Court’s decision in Dennis, from attacking the constitutionality of 9(h)6

The other is whether the petitioner quali­

fies, regardless of Dennis, upon the ground that it is in­
applicable, inasmuch as this is a post-conviction proceedings

and under the oral writs section and the other section provid­

2

ing for such relief, he would qualify for this relief»

section is no longer on the books»

Yes, I know.

I concede thatj yes, Your Honor»

Mow, let me say something about the petitioner»

10
'i!

and the evidence here, because I suppose, in the last analysis,

12

this Court is not going to look merely at forms, as the Govern­

13

ment invites it to do and say, "Well, in Dennis there was a

14

conspiracy to defraud and in Bryson’s case the jury found that

15

he lied about whether or not he was affiliated with the Com­

16
17

munist Party, therefore they are on a par,” this is the
Governments s position„
I would suppose that if Dennis lays down a rui

be heard, has .standing to be heard, one must look at the charac­
ter of the particular petitioner, insofar at least, as the
record and the evidence would seem to snow.
In Petitioner’s case the facts are these3

There is

no question that for a period of ten years, from 1937 to 1947,

7

1

he was a member of the Communist Party.

He was an officer of

2

that Party.

3

section level in San Francisco, and he was an officer on a

4

state level — state committee.

He was an officer on what is called the waterfront

There is no suggestion in this record that Bryson

5

6

ever attempted to conceal the fact of his membership or hold­

7

ing office in ‘the Communist Party when he was a member of it.

3

Now* in 1947 he terminated his association and there

3

is no evidence -- there was no evidence at the trial to sustain

10

any charge that there was an active relationship between him

n

and the Party thereafter.

The evidence upon which he was con­

It was summarized by the Government in its brief,

13
14

and'I assume that they have recorded from it as much as there

15

is, and that this is what it amounts to and is found on Pages 5

16

and 6 of the Government's brief.
First they said that in 1949 at an open union conven­

tion he — I quote what they says "premised — he refused to
seat a delegate at the union convention premised on the dele­
gate's failure to accept an opportunity to join the Communist
Party.

Now* not only was that two years before he filed the

affidavit in this case* but I mention that this is the type of
evidence on which the affiliation count was based.

But is it not after he now says that he ter­

minated his membership?

There is another piece of testimony that was given

by another person who* was expelled from the union or was in
the process of being expelled*

2

That3s the evidence.

Now, the District Court told the jury, based on the

3

record, what the kind of evidence was, that existed when Bryson

4

was a member of the Party and he told the jury that they should

5

take into consideration whether or not he held office or

6

official position in the Communist Party? whether he had ever

7

attempted to participate in Communist Party meetings? whether

8

or not he took instructions from Communist Party leaders?

9

whether he participated in distributing literature? whether he

to

solicited members for the Party? whether or not he cooperated

11

closely with and worked for their benefit, and so

oju

There v/as evidence that during the period of his

12

13

active membership — of his membership between 1937 and 1947

14

there was evidence that these are the activities in which he

15

engaged.

16

vocated or was ever present when there was advocated, or

17

whether he ever understood in whatever portion of the Communist

18

Party he was associated with, that there was forbidden doctrine

19

or policy advocated to further or that he himself believed in

20

the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force

21

22
23

24
25

There was no evidence, I might say, that he ever ad­

or violence and of course, there is no evidence in the case
itself offered by the Government to establish what the teach­
ings of the Communist Party were? what their doctrines were?
what their policies were? what their objectives were.
The case went to the jury on the sole question of

10

1

whether or not he was a member or affiliated with the Communist

2

Party * without any evidence to indicate either what he under­

3

stood it to be* based on his associations* or what the Party

4

itself stood for* in fact* from the viewpoint of the Government.

Q

Well* aren’t those arguments that were ad­

dressed to the Court when the case was tried?
A

All of the arguments that are offered now

were addressed to the Court when the case was tried.

We ad­

dressed these arguments on appeal to 'the Court of Appeals,
Court of Appeals rejected the arguments.

The

This Court did not

grant a position for certiorari we sought twice? first* after
the original conviction was upheld* and I should say* that in
the petition for rehearing that we filed with the Court of
Appeals was calling their attention to the fact that in their
first decision we thought they were establishing novel law(?)
they reiterated and they said* and I have copied out a sentence
from their opinion* which is referred to in our brief and as
wall as in the Government’s,

They answered us by saying that

although it was true that there was no evidence in the case of
active affiliation* -they didn't have to be in.

They said that

ship that can exist even when not manifested by an activity,®

22
As to the argument that we advanced that there had
23
to be some showing of what the Communist Party stood for* either

either as to Bryson* or as to the Party* but specifically as

5

to Bryson,

of that sort.

because Congress assumed that anybody found to have been

affiliated with the Communist Party* necessarily presented a

threat to the country in which he would throw the country into

The Congress wanted to

political strikes.
The Court of Appeals answered that argument by
saying that the requirement of adherence to Communist Party

13

p urposes was covered by the instruction, to the jury that said*

14

in effect* affiliation is a very difficult concept to define,

15

I tell you in essence* that it's everything but membership in

18

name only* and suggested that it is comparable to a relation­

17

ship between a man and woman who are not married.

instruction to the jury advising that affiliation would be

19

found only if -there was some evidence that Bryson adhered to

20

some forbidden doctrine* or that he advanced some policy or

21

believed in some policy* whether it be the overthrew of the

22

Government by violence* or the calling of political strikes.

23

There was no

Now* this was the evidence against the man* and

24

nothing else.

He didnst take the stand.

25

in our brief why.

We have fried to show

It was the practice then* and it may

1

still foe, that in cases of this kind, or any kind,, perhaps,

2

if a person has been a member of the Communist Party, it is

3

uniformly practiced through the prosecutor to inquire on cross-

a
'-~v

examination for the names of other persons who were in the

5

party at the time that the witness was.

6

It was clear at the time, and we have set forth in

7

detail the reasons, that if he were asked questions of that

3

kind and if he declined, to become an informant oh persons he

9

had known long years ago in the Communist Party, he would foe

10

sentenced to a jail term for contempt of court by the trial

n

judge and, of course, that would take place in the presence of

12

the jury, and if he had any chance of becoming acquitted he

13

would lose it with a thing like that happening, as well as

14

gaining a jail term.

15

But there are soma things to some men that are even

18

more important than the risk of spending a term of years in

17

prison and one of them is a matter of honor.

18

to testify in order to avoid being placed in this dilemma of

19

having to become either an informer or showing disrespect for

20

the court by declining to answer questions that he would be

21

ordered to answer.

22

Bryson chose not

In the absence of Bryson's testimony, because he

23

couldn’t, under those circumstances he was not a free agent to

24

get up and either deny those statements that he claimed had not

25

been made that were attributed to him or if he made some of them.
13

1

to explain the context in which they were made so that the

2

jury could know what he was doing and what he was saying.

Poi rteen x^itnesses — reputable people from various

7
3

walks of the community were called to testify that he anjoyed

9

an excellent reputation for truth; honesty and integrity.

His

10

record of having sailed at seas for many, many years, and being

It

subject to the United States Coast Guard regulations, of course,

12

was a fact that he had never been arrested on any charge,

13

either a charge of violating a regulation or for that matter, a

14

violation of any law*

15

I have trouble understanding, Mr. Gladstein,

20

understand it, of being affiliated with the Communist Party at

affiliated.

Thatas water over the dam? he was convicted.

24
25

After all, the jury did convict him under instruc­

?hat”s a finding of his appeal? that's a finding.

Now, what questions as _o why he might not have
testified and what his motivations have been are of interest,
14

1

but I don’t see what relevance they have to the issues now here

9

that is being done, but I would think that it is relevant to

Ites because the Government relies on the

Nothing like

10

the exercise of discretion, if that8s what's involved; if

11

Dennis is a relevant decision to consider here', it would be

12

important, to consider what the record was, whatever the jury

13

found, what the record was concerning Bryson so as to deter™

14

mine whether he compares with or contrasts with the defendants

15

in the Dennis case.

16
17

I wanted to wind up with one more thing concerning
what happened and that was this:

18

We called as a .witness for the defense, .the agent

19

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was in charge of

20

the prosecution against Bryson and he testified that under

21

cover informants and agents of the FBI were and had been,

22

throughout this period, before and after 1947, within this grouj

23

that Bryson at one time had been a member of; that none of his

24

informants and none of his agents testified and nobody came

25

forward to testify against Bryson.

3-5

Mow, I realize that’s

1

consistent with a policy* a decision of the FBI that, it did not

2

want* for reasons of its own* that it has the right to make*

3

did not want to reveal the identity of someone who was in that

4

section,,

5

Bryson has steadfastly made from the beginning and has never

6

deviated from that he was innocent? that he was neither a

7

member or affiliated with the Communist Party at any time after

But it is also consistent with the assertion that

9

As Mr. Justice has suggested* isn’t that the

issue that has long since been settled and disposed of.

have spent most of your time and haven’t yet suggested any

involves the political liberties of the individual.

We are

talking about rights of the caliber that the First Amendment

prohibits

attainder.
I do not think that this Court’s decision can
possibly equate cases like the Kapp and those decisions which

we treat in our brief, at all with what this Court again and

in Brown, there the Government argued that 9(h) and 504 were
enacted to serve the same purpose, the same substance, only a
little difference in form and there were things to show that
the force exerted on 9(h) was just as forceful, just as effec­
tive, just as punitive as 504»
equally true today.

If that was true then, it is

Dennis, for

develop, would not on the facts of this case, warrant or would
not justify the Court in preventing Bryson from being hurt»

Counsel started with the proposition that the basic

We look at the case somewhat differently*

As we

understand, it, the basic question here is the basic issue that
the Court of Appeals thought it was faced with and the principle
on which it decided this case had to do with the question of
whether the rationale of this Court in Dennis versus the United
States, decided several terras age, applies here»
In short;, that rationale is simply thiss that on^
fains or purports to comjr •/

th the law, by .taking- some sort*

of action, as required'by the Government-of him, but. in fact, is j
proceeding falsely or fraudulently in so*-doing, lacks standing
when he is discovered to have acted fraudulently, to challenge
the lav? that he purported to comply with.
That principle was not established in Dermis.

It

goes back to earlier cases of this Court, such as Kay and Kapp.
It hs been accepted by every circuit, to my knowledge, that has
considered it.
It's simply, it seems to me, a basic principle of

10

11

Petitioner's brief, we suggest that there are several respects
in which Dennis is distinguishable.

14
15
16

19
20
21

22

Well, that's

true „
As the Cour* , however, noted'in Dennis, some of the
petititioners involved in the conspiracy there charged, which
was a conspiracy to defraud the United States by doing exactly
the same thing that Petitioner did> filed false affidavits
under Section 9{h) of Taffc-Hartley.
The Court noted there that at least some of the

17
18

He says first that Dennis

involved a conspiracy and this case does not.

12

13

Any other rule would breed, 1 would

petitioners could have been charged under the False Statement
Act that Petitioner himself was discharged under, 18 U«,S.C.
1001«,

I take it the reason they weren't was because some of

the petitioners who allegedly and were found to have engaged
in a conspiracy there were not, themselves, union officers
required to file these affidavits, but instead, participated

23
24

with union officers in the conspiracy to file them.
We can't really see that the fact that the

25
19

1

conspiracy was charged and was involved in Dennis that makes

2

the case of substantial difference.

3

the Court’s Opinion in Dennis that refers to the fact of

4

conspiracy,: but as we understand it* that language related

5

basically to the threshhold issue in Dennis as to whether the

6

indictment was appropriate there. And the Court concluded that

7

it was appropriate* over strenuous arguments made to the con­

8

trary and in the course of that* noted a conspiracy was in­

3

volved.

There is some language in

Petitioner also notes that the case is now on

10
11

collateral and not direct review* and in that respect* differs

12

from Dennis and for some reason that this presents a different

13

situation.
Now* we5re quite aware of the increasing breadth

14

15

and the scope of collateral review, but we have not thought that

16

we have reached the point where collateral was broader than

17

direct.

And it seems to us that it’s a rather difficult

18

lesson to accept that Petitioner is in better position with

19

respect to the basic .rationale that the Court relied in Dennis

20
21

22
23

24
25

than the individuals involved in Dennis* because he is now on
collateral and not on direct.
The Petitioner also suggests and at great length*
that the facts are different than the facts in Dennis.
frankly we don’t quite understand that.

Well*

In his brief he relied

extensively on an affidavit that he filed on a later collateral
20

1

proceeding and here he has noted that Mr» Bryson terminated ail

2

relationships with the Communist Party in 1947, at least in

3

his view.

4

jury had to resolve, and as I have indicated, the jury

5

resolved against him.

6

Now, of course that was one of the issues that the

Insofar as he seeks to reopen and relitigate those

7

facts, it seems to us that's not an appropriate question as

8

presented to this Court.

9

The question of supposed amhuity in the notion of

10

affiliation is also raised by Petitioner.

11

contexts in which the notion of affiliation with the Communist

12

Party or some other organization would be a difficult and

13

dubious thing to present to a jury.

14

Stewart noted, in the context here under a very narrow and

15
.16

There may well be

But as Mr. Justice

limited instruction which is set out in the Government's brief,
which followed and was confirmed by this Court's decision in the

17

Killian case, Pages 6 and 7 in -the Government's brief, Note 5,

18

we set out the basic instructions.

19

order for Petitioner to have been affiliated with the Communist

20

Party, he must have been a member in everything but name.

21

as the Chief Justice has indicated, the fact as developed for

22

24
25

The jury was told that in

And

the jury trial, indicated that various incidents in the evidence
j
were related, which indicated the Petitioner had continued to
maintain at least some connection withe the Party.

Connection

in the sense that idle jury could find that he was affiliated
21

1

with the Party when he filed the false affidavit, in 1951«

2

I think that any analysis of the Dennis opinion

3

makes it rather clear that it’s difficult, if not impossible

4

for Petitioner to say that idle Court of Appeals erred in

5

concluding that Dennis was controlling here.

6

petitioners are in no position to attack the constitutionality

7

in 9(h) because they sought to circumvent the statute? not to

8

challenge it.

Dennis said

Ways are open to challenge the validity of statutes

9
10

like 9(h) of Taft-Hartley.

11

but it was upheld.

12

Court of Appeals indicated, a number of union men, after the

13

passage of — union officers, after the passage of Section

14

9(h), who were members of the Communist Party, determined that

15

the best course of action was for them to formally disassociate

W

themselves with the Party and then file, when and if necessary

17

those affidavits that Section 9(h) required.

Douds was decided in 1950.

22

This affidavit was

23

filed less than a year later.

24

not at all dissimilar from that that the Court referred to in

Dennis.

I think that the situation is

1

circumstances” ~ what Petitioner did there was to flout —

principle.
Q

That's right.

As I read your brief* whichever

way the constitutional question is decided* his conviction for
11

12
13

making a false statement would stand.

And that's the basis for

the "no stand” issue* isn't it* rather than —
A

That's right.

But I am suggesting that in

the circumstances here we don't even have that extreme a

situation, because as the situation exists right now the

statute sund now he is seeking to turn around when hess caught

11

in 'complying with it in a fraudulent manner,

12

Q

Well, would you make that argument if it were

13

really true and — if it would make a difference under the

14

False Statement Statute, whether the statute was unconstitu­

15

tional or not?

16

A

Would you still make this standing argument?
I5m not sure that I understand.

I agree with

17

you that it doesn’t matter whether the statute's unconstitu­

18

19

Q

Well, assume that it did make a difference

20

whether the statute was constitutional or not.

21

that he would be barred from raising this constitutional ques­

22

tion just because he told a lie?

23

A

Would you say

But 1 think that’s an entirely different,

24

situation, and that's the situation we had in Dennis and the

25

situation here don't involve that.
27

Dennis stated in conclusion, that the governing

1

principle is that a claim of unconstitutionality will not be

3

heard to excuse a voluntary, deliberate and calculated course

4

of fraud and deceit.

S

of seM-help cannot escape the consequences by urging that his

6

conduct be excused because the statute which he sought, to

7

evade was unconstitutional.

One who elects such a course», as a means

As I have indicated, the Government feels that there

3

are policy considerations that support the rationale of Dennis,

9

as well.

10

If the law were otherwise, it seems to me it would

u

be but an open invitation to individuals to seek to circumvent

12

a law by purporting to comply with it in the course of which

13

they would commit a violation of the statute, such as the

14

False Statement Act.

15

Q

16

The conviction in this case was what, a

violation of Title 18, 1001?

17
18
19

20

A

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

Which is not, itself, 9(h), of course.

A

Right.

As I pointed out earlier, the charge

here was not that the Petitioner had violated the very statute
21

he is seeking to challenge as unconstitutional, but in the courf e

22

of purporting to comply with that statute which he now says is

unconstitutional.

Now, if

22

that's true, if that lav; was unconstitutional, or for other

23

reasons, for instance the Fifth Amendment which we argued,

24

then it seems to me the threshhold inquiry is where is where

25

you stop the minute you determine that Congress has offended the
34

1

Constitution»

If that's true* then Congress’s enactment

2

should he nullified and it doesn't matter at all what the

3

citizen is required to do under the coercion of an unconstitu­

4

tional statute»

It was suggested that suppose Congress did this to

the Republican Party and Counsel said he'd have more trouble»

Suppose they did it to the Socialist Party?

Jackson in the Douds case said* "I have no trouble saying that

I the Congress can't do this with the Republican Party or the

Democratic Party or the Socialist Party»

that the Socialists were expelled after being lawfully elected

We know from history

Congress have no more right and the the state have
no more right, to pass a bill that lumps all of the people in
a political group, no matter what their opinions are, and
precisely because they are unorthodox, hated, unpopular?
precisely those are entitled to the protections of the Bill of
Attainder of the First Amendment and it must have been for
those reasons that the framers of the Constitution put those
provisions in there»
Q

All that Congress has dona is say that

citizens when dealing with the Government, can't lie»
A

Your Honor is talking about Section 1001»

But this case is based upon -- the underlying statute is 9(h)„
Without Section 3(h) or some other section of the law, without
35

1

some other section of law, 1001 has no meaning in itself*

2

Congress can't just pass laws saying

that anybody ever asked*

that Congress has.

In this case, utilizing the Congress’s power, or

purporting to do so. Congress passed Section 9(h)

I don't think that is an accurate way of

looking at it*

Irrespective of whether —• to translater it a little bit —

All that the Congress has done here is to says

I submit that the more basic question is

that when dealing with

its citizens. Congress has no right to

enact a statute which deprives them4 of their constitutional
liberty, particularly in the field of politics.

May I ask you one other question?

About the lying business*

passes a series of laws, as it might well do sometimes, making

you file all kinds of affidavits, with reference to your

political beliefs and persuasions and what you have done»

law on the grounds that he lied?

That's what they say, and if this Court should

Is it, Your Honor?

Q

I think it's a pretty broad statement»

I woulc

suppose the Government's position would be -the same on Mr»
Justice's hypothetical»

If it passes a law that violates the

First Amendment and the prosecution is for lying about

to

an agency that has jurisdiction,whether it’s the Republican
Party, the Democratic, Communist Party or anything else,
Congress is well within its power in doing that»
A

Mr» Justice, haven't you assumed in your state­

ment when pu said an agency that has jurisdiction *»“*
Q

Well, I am using jurisdiction in the broad

senses punitive, I3m not using it in any technical sense.
A

It is my contention that there just isn't any

jurisdiction if the statute upon which power is being exerted

is itself, violating the Constitution»

May I suggest to you that a Congress can do

that whenever it gets heated up over some political question

it has a way of setting millions of traps for citizens who

ought not to be convicted by it.

A

Well, history shows that the bills of

attainder in England and in the colonies were precisely used,

and that’s the one distinguishing feature of them? they were

all politically inspired and utilized against political groups,

Is there anything, Mr. Gladstein, in any of

these hypothetical situations that you have suggested that

10

would prevent a citizen from challenging the constitutionality

on First Amendment grounds?

refuses to comply with the law?

Is there any other ground when he

Well, the Court has reviewed cases of both

14

types in the United States against Brown to show their un­

cons titutionality.
