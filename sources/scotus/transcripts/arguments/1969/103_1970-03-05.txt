BEHALF OF APPELLANT

MR» SPRINGER:
the Court:

This

Mr» Chief Justice and may it please

case brings to this Court for the Fifth time,

questions under the Great New Packers Anti-Trust decree of
■

■ n,

12

.

I

1920»
That decree was entered on consent without a trial

13

on the basis of the bill in equity that the Government had'

14

brought against the nation's five largest meat packers: Wilson,j

15

Swift, Cudahy, Armour, which is involved in this case, and

16

Morris, which Armour subsequently acquired»

17

The complaint in general charged that the packers had

18

violated Sections 1 and. 2 of the Sherman Act by obtaining con-

19

trol of a very great proportion of the food supply in the

20

nation, both meat and other foods, and by abusing that control

21

so as to restrict competition among themselves and to eliminata

22

their other competitors.

23

The consent decree that the parties agreed upon in

24

1320 and that the Court adopted, imposed sweeping and perpetual

25

restraints, both upon the future activities of thepackers and
2

1

'I

upon the business relationship that the packers would be allowen

2

to have with enterprises engaged in the production and sale of

3

food other than meat.
And. despite the efforts of defendants over the

4
5

years, to relax these restrictions, they remained in effect.

6

And the Court, most recently in 1961, rejected an attempt by

7

the packers to relax the restrictions upon them.
The decree is complex and I will tales the time here

i
§

only to discuss the particular paragraphs that are in issue in

to

this case.

ii

which begins on page 30 of the appendix.

12

vides that the meat packing corporation, including, of course.

13

Armour, are perpetually enjoined andrestrained from either

14

directly or indirectly, by themselves, or through their offi­

IS

cers , directors, agents, or servants, engaging in or carrying

16

on the manufacturing, jobbing, selling, transporting, except as

17
13

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Thus, principally, paragraph Fourth in the decree,
That paragraph pro­

common carriers, distributing or otherwise dealing in some 114
listed food products, including bakery products, most, other
groceries, vegetables .and fruits.
Paragraph Fourth goes on to provide that the corporation defendants are hereby further perpetually enjoined and
restrained from owning, either directly or indirectly, severally
or jointly, by themselves or through their officers, directors,
agents or servants, from owning, that is; any capital stock or
other interest, whatsoever in any corporation, firm or
3

1

association,, except -gemmcn carriers, which is in the business,

2

the same business that I mentioned: manufacturing, jobbing,

3

selling,, transporting, distributing or otherwise dealing in

4

any of the above described products or commodities.
Paragraph Six of the decree further perpetually'

3

6

enjoins the defendants from operating retail meat markets, and

1

paragraph 8 enjoins the packers from dealing, directly or in™

B

directly in fresh milk and cream.
In short, the Meat Packers5 Decree- perpetually ex­

9

cludes Armour from having any direct or indirect interest,

m

whatsoever, in any firm in the baking or general grocery

n

business, and it prohibits Armour from otherwise dealing

12

directly or indirectly in the enumerated products.

13

i

The Decree is what is commonly-referred to as a

14

15
16

17
18
1®
26
21

22

structural

-i that is, rather thansimply enjoining the

.

defendants from particular anti-competitive acts, it establishes
a prophylactic separation between the defendants, but excluding
them from other businesses where it is felt that their involve­
ment might create a danger to the. competition.
General Host, which is the Appel,lee in this case, is
a company that is widely involved in the baking business and
the general grocery and restaurant business.

Itis known, until

a couple of years ago, as General Baking Company and under the
23

brand name Bend Baking Company and others as manufacturers, and
24
sell throughout the country, a complete line of bread and other
23

4

j

i

bakery products.

It also has a division called;

"Little

z

General Stores," which has soma 380 convenience retail food

3

markets in various parts of the South. . And it also has sub­

4

sidiaries that operate restaurants and other tourist facilities

S

throughout the country.
It’s plain and undisputed in this case that General

6

7

Host9s business is such that under the 1920 decree Armour

$

could not. have -acquired any direct or indirect ownership interest

9

whatsoever in General Host.

)

This litigation began about a year ago when General

10

11

Host decided the reverse of that? he would take over Armour

'32

by acquisition techniques that have become familiar in recent

13

years.

14

Host made a tender offer to Armour’s stockholders in which it

IS

sought to acquire a majority of Amour’s stock in return for

16

a package of debentures and stock warrants in General Host.

17

Over the opposition of Armour’s management, General

The tender offer was expressly conditioned upon the

18

tender by shareholders of enough stock to give General Host an

19

absolute majority of Armour stock and it provided that it would

20

be called off if that amount of stock were not tendered.

21

When the tender offer was made, the Government

22

immediately sought to block this takeover, on the theory that

23

a corporate alliance between Armour’s meat packing's business

24

25

j

and General Host's bakery and retail grocery businesses would
be just inconsistent with the Meat Packers® Deere© if initiated

5

i

1

2

by Armour»
It was. plain, of course, that General Host9s acquisi­

3

tion of Armour would not be directly punishable under the

4

decree, sines the active party, General Host, was not a party

3

to that, decree»

6

Accordingly, the Government went to the District

7

Court in Chicago, which has had continuing jurisdiction, at

8

least in recant years over the Meat Packers3 Decree and there

S

the Government requested a supplemental order to prohibit the

1

10

takeover by General Host,

11

18 of the decree, which, like most decrees, expressly retains

12

jurisdiction for the purpose of taking such other action or

13

adding to the foot of this decree, such otherrelief as may be­

14

come necessary or appropriate for the carrying out and enforce­

13

ment of this decree,

10

17
18

Q

It did this consistent with paragrap

Did the Government8s request to the District

Court subsume a request to ©mend the -decree?
A

Not in terms and of course, this is, I think, the

19

semantic problem that is the heart of this case, that I keep

20

coming back to back to,

21

Q

'Let's assume the Government has taken the

22

approach that we think the decree should be amended expressly

23

to prohibit matters like this.

24

hearing or any different type of procedure have been required?

25

A

Would any different kind of a

I think we would contend that there would not be
6

1

be any requirement for a different kind of procedure on the

a

theory that, I, of course, will elaborate, that we think that

3

in a very real sense, the four corners of this decree do pro­

4

vide a rather clear condemnation of this kind of situation.

In other words, the Government's theory of the case,

3
S

to put it another way, has not been foasdd upon tany asserted

7

change in facts, other than, of course, the undisputed fact --

Q

$
g

Suppose if you accepted the fact that the pur­

pose of the decree was to prohibit an alliance of any kind

10

between the Armour entity and any of the other described

51

entities.

12

amended it or just interpreted it? would it?

13

Then it wouldn't make much difference whether you

A

No, I think not, and of course, I could make the

14

further observation that it seems a little strange and incon­

15

sistent with traditional equitable theories for a decree to say

18

"Nobody in the world shall take over this company."

17

unusual form at the least, for a decree and of course, it

IS

doesn't have any operative effectin the normal sense.

19

20
21

Q

That's an

YOu say it would have been an unusual provision.

That's exactly your argument now.
A

Yes, but when we say — 1 was really just ad­

22

dressing myself to the question of whether the presence or

23

absence of such language in a decree would make any differ -nee.

24

Q

Yes.

25

A

Wa say, and I will elaborate that substantively

7

>

?

this decree established a separation between these two busi­

a

nesses and the establishment of that separation, as a substan­

3

tive matter, is frustrated by this kind of take over.
Q

4

Is there any suggestion here that the tender by

5

Host was stimulated or initiated or originated or collaborated

6

in by Amour?

7

A

No;; it5s «^disputable that the opposite is true.

S

Q

Is the other way.

©

A

Was proposed»

Though I do find it hard' to see

!0

why, under the theory followed below and the theory that the

n

Appellees follow, why that should make any difference.

12

does it, whatever the motives, what the intentions are, pre­

13

cisely the 'same kind of situation would arise.
Q

14

Whoever

Dbesn31 that overlook the fact that traditionally

15

and ordinarily you have to have a party in order to reach them

16'

with relief.
A

17

Well, of course, Section 5 of the Sherman Act

18

specifically does provide, and this was relied upon by the

19

Government below that whenever the interest of justice shall

20

require, the Court may bring in additional parties,
Q

21

22

White suggested —
.

23
24
25

Did you follow that procedure that Mr. Justice

A

Well, I think —

Q

But you are now bringing in another party? aren’t

you?

8

1

A

Yes, General Boat, and of course, Section 5

2

permits that to be done as a procedural matter and establishes

3

the Court8s jurisdiction over --

4

Q

Was General Host in existence in 1920?

5

A

I believe that its predecessor, General Baking

6

Company, 1 think, was incorporated in 1911»

7

had no connection whatever with the packers and there was no

8

reason for the Government even to think about.bringing it in

9

or foreseeing what might happen in a very different kind of

10

Of course, it

business climate some 50 years later on.

11

Judge Hoffman of the District Court of Chicago, of

12

course, denied the Government53 petition to add General Host

13

as a party and to add an order to the decree prohibiting the

14

takeover.

IS

as I read what he said — that the literal terms of the decree

16

do not prohibit nondefendant owners of stock in meat packing

17

companies from engaging in businesses- prohibited to meat packers

m

themselves by the decree.

n

He relied, quite simply, on the proposition that —

In other words, as he explained orally, the decisive

20

fact in the case is that Amour will not be the controlling

2!

force, but rather, the instrumentality of General Host.

22

said that since the villain of the piece, in the terns he used,

23

was not Armour, but General.Host, the decree could not be used

24

to prevent the takeover.

25

He

If Judge Hoffman's rather scanty'conclusions of law

9

t

rest on the proposition that he did not have jurisdictional

2

power to supplement the decree in this kind of way, we thinkhe

3

was plainly wrong, for the reasons which we set out in our

4

brief, and which 1 believe are not basically disputed by the

S

Appellees»
Q

6
7

10

A
it was wrong.

13
14

Xt8s not clear that it did.

If it did, 1 think

I think the power is really not the major, issue

here.

11
.12

didn't read the District Court as saying it

was without jurisdictional power.

a
§

1

Q ■

It's not an issue at all between you and your

A

1 believe .that's so? yes.

Appellees.
There is a certain

amount of back - and forth, I think within the General Post

15

0

There is a lot of back and forth in everything.

16

A

So, i will direct my point only to the proposi­

17

tion that the structural prohibitions of this decree are

'13

frustrated and sometimes violated by this takeover and I think

19

General Host does, in the last analysis, agree that if thats

20

the case, then the Court could and should, indeed, have granted

21

the relief requested.

22

,

I think

.that perhaps the problem as I suggested In

23

this case is a semantic one, basically.

24

whole case is the proposition that the decree is violated qs

25

frustrated because the takeover creates a situation that the
10

The basis for our

1

decree was designed specifically to prevent.
General Host in the court below? as 1 understand

2
3

them? say that that can't be so? because nobody has disobeyed

4

a command that the decree directed to tt9 because the decree

5

does not? in terms proscribe Armour’s acquisition by a grocery j

S

company«
- Well? we think that’s ranch too narrow reading.

7

Of

a

course the decree is not a —- a civil decree is not a punitive

'9

document and it obviously does affect people other than the

.10

particular, individuals who happen -to be accused of wrongdoing

II

at the time the decree was entered.

12

shocking or unusual the decree should affect parties in a

13

business sense? people other than the initial parties to the

14

case.

15

So? I think it’s not

We think? in fact? the literal language of the

16

decree condemns precisely the situation that has been created

17

by the takeover.

18

from directly engaging in General Host's business? but even

19

more specifically, it prohibits Armour from having, directly or

20

indirectly, any capital stock or other interest whatsoever in

2?

General Host or in General Host’s subsidiaries that are en­

22

gaged in the forbidden businesses.

23

Paragraph Fourth not only prohibits Armour

It seems to me extremely literalistic to say that

24

when Armour -is. a subsidiary of General Host it has no interest

25

whatsoever, either in General Host's business or in the business

11

1

a

of its sister subsidiaries of General Host.
Certainly ip as I suggested, this conclusion seems not

3

difficult to reach if this kind of situation arose by actions

4

in which Armour or its management joined, or perhaps even

5

instigated, and equally, 1 think, it would not seam trouble­

6

some to say that the decree would prohibit a situation where

7

Armour or its stockholders or management or dissident stock­

8

holders, through a proxy fight or something like that, created

0

a holding company, which then had two subsidiaries, one of them

to

ir

being the old armour and the other being General Host.
Topufc it another way: the situation we now have is

12

one corporation that directly or indirectly is in both busi­

13

nesses, the meat packing business and the grocery business and

14

that corporation is General Host.

15

business and it's indirectly in the meat packing business

16

through its controlled subsidiary, Armour.

17

that is just precisely what the -structural provisions

18

decree prohibited and, in fact, the only reason why there would

19

have been structural provision inthe decree is to prevent that

20

kind of situation from arising.

It's directly in the grocery

Yes.

Q

The facts in that certainly might be true here,

But, ' ut old violations do give rise to perpetual

too.

19

decrees and of course it is a ground for modification if the

20

defendants subject to the■initial decree can prove that they

2!

are at. some serious competitive disadvantage because of

22

drastic changes in the market.

23
24
25

0

Is this that same old consent decree that's been

around for about 40 years?
A

Fifty years, Mr. Justice.
13

It has been twice —

1

well, three times there was some current efforts»

In the

E

early 30s the packers tried to modify it. to relieve them ©f

3

just these restrictions on their involvement in the grocery

4

business and they had another effort beginning in the late

.

3

50s which ended in 1961 when this Court summarily affirmed the

8

District Court’s determination that the packers had hot made

7

the kind of showing which would be required tojustify modifi­

&

cation of the decree»

22
23
24

The decree, though ites old, has been, in a sense,
revivified within relatively recent years»

We think it's

highly pertinent to the problem here what the Court said in
considering these earlier requests for modification, because
we think that the language the<courts used and the analysis
of this Court and the District Court followed in those cases,
gives rather explicit content to the substantive prohibitions
I
and shows what their specific purpose was»
In 1932 Justice Cardoso, speaking for the Court in
the second Swift case in this Court, rejected, as I said, con­
tentions that themarket had changed, that the wrongdoers ware
not in the picture any more and therefore it was not necessary
to maintain this separation between the grocery business and the
meat packing business and the Court used the following language,
which I think is revealing here:„
"Whether the defendants would resume their predatory
practices if they were to deal in grgeeries again, we do not

23
14

i

know.

2

Their low overhead and their gigantic size, even when they are

3

viewed as separate units, would still put them in a position

4

to starve out weaker rivals,"

They would certainly have the temptation to resume it,

"Mere size, according to the holding of this Court,,, is

5
8

not an offense against the Sherman Act* unless magnified to

7

the point at which it amounts to monopoly».

i

with it an opportunity for abuse.

&

when the opportunity is proved to have been utilized in the

10

But, "size carries

It is not to be ignored

past.
"The original decree, at all events, was framed upon

11

12

that i&scay•«."

Justice Cardoso went on to say that "If the

13

grocery business is added to the meat business, there may be

14

many instances of unfair pressure upon retailers and others

15

with the design of forcing them to buy fromfche defendants and

16

not from rival grocers."
Such, at any rate, was the rationale of the decree

37
18

of 1920.

19

born of that fear, the difficulty of ferreting out these

20

evils and repressing them when discovered supplies an additional

21

reason why the structural restrictions should be maintained.

22

It's restraints, whether just or excessive, were

Q

Well, all those things are good arguments for
ji

23

processing against General Host'perhaps, in an independent

24

proceeding, in an ucHon,

25

unwise, unsound-, to have these two branches of the food

I think that if it's fundamentally

15

t

industry combined, that can be reached in other ways than this?

z

can't it?

3
4

A

Yes, of course there are problems that, until

— enormous problems in a traditional Section. 7 action in a
'

S

case like this»

6

The point I was driving at was not that, as a general

7

proposition the combination of a large packer in a meat company

8

is a bad thing, but this Court has read this very decree, which

S

as a party to it, Amour, as embodying a specific purpose to

i
10

prevent that kind of addition of the grocer]/ business,, to

11...

Amour's meat packing business.

.

12

And for that reason we think that the Government

13

should not have to start from scratch, it having been speci­

14

fically decreed that Armour’s business should not be combined

15

with the grocery business,

16

__

In none of the past history and the language that the

17

Court has used, is there any suggestion that•the■ importance of

18

this separation depends upon who threatens to break it down,
«

19

-The reason for the separation is, plainly, the danger

2(f

of any corporate links, however created, between Armour's

21

large size and power, which of course, when General Host owns

22

and controls Armour, in a very real sense, becomes power that

23

General Host has.

24

entities, but I find it very hard in my mind to say that when

25

General Host wholly or in the sense of absolute control, owns

And certainly there are separate corporate

16

1

Armour, that General Host is not Armour in some very meaningful

z

sense.
The ultimate owners are the same; Armour's destiny

3
4

is controlled by General Host, so I think that apart from the

5

conceptual fact that there are separate corporate shelves, if

6

you will, Armour is , in a very real sense, or has become ,

General Host; General Host is Armour, and has the power that

ORAL ARGUMENT BY HERBERT A. BERGSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

22

MR. BERGSON:

23

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

24

Court:

Perhaps I should answer Ito. Justice Stewart’s question

25

first by describing the present status of the negotiations
18

1

between General Host and Greyhound.
The agreement was signed some time ago, subject to

2
3

three things: approval of General Host's stockholders, approval

4

of Greyhound's stockholders and approval of the I.C.C., because

5

Greyhound is a motor carrier and under the Interstate Commerce

6

Act, any acquisition of this type must be approved by the

7

I.C.C.
0

8
9
10

And the agreement provided for the sale by

General Host to Greyhound, of General Host's interest in
Armour; is that it?
A

11

That's it„

And the Greyhound stockholders have

12

approved; the General Host stockholders have approved the

13

agreement»

14

I am not prepared to prognosticate as to xvhen the I.C.C. might

15

act on that application.

16

The I.C.C. has not yet acted on the application anc

New, as Mr. Springerindicated, there is also a

12

brief in this case, I thought thafcthis was their major point,

13

and that the case

14

along, a question as to whether or not this decree as it now

IS

stands, can be interpreted to prevent this transaction and if

16

it can be so interpreted, what type of hearing is General Host

17

entitled to before that interpretation is imposed on General

18

Host?

IS

As I read the Government's

has now become, what I think it was all

What the Department did in. this case was merely to

20

go to the District Court, file an affidavit and say: "General

21

Host is in the baking business; the baking business; the

22

baking business is proscribed to Armour; therefore you must

23

proscribe this transaction." And we don't think the only

24
25

hearing that they thought was necessary was to show that
General Host was in the baking business.
20

1

NowI think it's somewhat shocking- for the Depart­

2

ment of Justice to take the position that a person who is not

3

a party to an equity decree, who has never .been-heard on that

4

decree, who was not joined at the time of the decree, although

5

it wasin existence at the time the action was maintained, be

6

found by the decree without proof of anything else.
It seems to me that underany circumstances, even,

7
8

assuming that the Department's interpretation of the decree is

9

right, that General Host is entitled to a hearing on whether

10

or not it should be bound by the decree»

the imprimatur of the Court, can deprive anybody of his legal;

Q

Hr. Bergson, what would you say if the original

16

decree had said that Armour can't acquire any stock in a

17

baking company and no baking company can acquire any stock in

18

Armour, and then this transaction took place and the United

19

States applied to the Court for an order preventing General

20

Host from —

a party to the case —

That's right.

— to prevent General

I think that under those circumstances General

that encompassed not only horizontal agreements among them, but

able to effect commerce in the substitute food business»

I don't think it makes any difference v/hether it's a consent

me and itis my position that under the circumstances tnat you

only to the parties, but anybody in privy or acting in concert
with the parties, and under the circumstances that you pos­
tulated they would be acting in concert»

Well? all right? that's the way you character­

Well, I think I can state my position this way:

5

that to the extent that any non-party is found to have been

6

acting in concert or privity with a party, whether it says so

7

in the decree — it doesn’t say so in the decree — the rules

8

make such a privy subject to the injunction, but the Government

9

concedes here that there was no such concert, and that there

10
11

was no such privilege.
And they are trying to make the decree applicable to

relations with any defen

Q

Well, it's a rhetorical position on your part,

then, to make your point, I take it?
A
Honor, is this:

That's right.

But, our position here, Your

Number one that the decree can't be inter­

preted the way the Government seeks to interpret it, and you
just can't turn words upside down.

13
14

If you look at the decree as it is written, the de­
cree was very, very carefully framed and it isn’t a structural

15
decree per se, as Mr. Springer would have you believe.

There

18
are many behavioral provisions in the decree.

There were three

17

types of defendants in this case: there were the meat packer
18

defendants; there were individual defendants who were the major
1©

stockholders in the meat company; and there were some 50
20
subsidiaries of the meat companies who were defendants.

There

21

were quite a few defendants in this case.
22
When the consent decree was negotiated, these various
23

defendants were given different types of treatment.

The pro­

24

visions that Mr. Springer referred to, two of them: four and
25
25
i

t

eight, specifically refer fco proper defendants.
Paragraph 6, which is another one that he referred tc

2
3

applies fco all defendants, and paragraph 5 of the decree

4

applies fcoindividua! defendants.

control of the meat packers, were permitted fco own stock in

the forbidden businesses, the businesses forbidden to the meat

packers.

10

Now, in paragraph 5 of the

14

tive prevision which says that you can't use them in a way

that would help either Armour in its business or yourself, or

These companies were permitted to

So that this decree did not declare a complete

separation as the Government says, of the business of meat

this decree as a prophylactic structural decree.

and they did not intend to reach the situation,,

to reach the situation that is covered here,

9

that if General Host abused its control and caused Amour to

But, mere ownership doesn’t cause Armour to violate

13

the —
Q

14

What kind of a hearing would you say would be

15

required for the Government to secure an amendment cf the

18

decree?
A

17

Well, what happened — there are a couple of

18

precedents in this area: one is this Court’s decision in the

19

Hughes case, where the Government sought a construction of the

20

decree and the Court set it back and said that this was an

21

attempt to modify the decree and that ah appropriate hearing

22

should be had to 'determine whether this type of .relief was

23

necessary„

24
25

How, 1 think we are entitled to a hearing — at leasi
a hearing as to whether or not this type of relief is
28

i

necessary to effectuate — let us go this far — I’m just

2

conceding this for argument —

3

Q

Effectuate what, Mr» Bergson?

4

A

To effectuate what the Government claims were

5
6

the purposes of this decree»
Q

Well, what do you think the purposes were?

7

You apparently deny that one of the purposes was to effect a

8

separation between meat packers and other — and substitute

9

food companies»

1©

A

No»

I say that it was the purpose of it was

it

to prevent proven or admitted violators who had used their

12

power in the past, from using it in the future, which is done

13

in many, many anti-trust cases»

14

Q

But, we're a non-proven violator and we

15

Q

You don't —

16

A

and we're a non-admitted violator»

17

Q

You don’t treat it as a blanket prohibition in

18

the terms that Mr. Justice White has postulated? that the

5©

food processors, bakers, non-meat food processors, should

2©

never be in combination with meat packers?

21

A

Oh, no? I don't think that anything in this

22

decree prohibits the largest meat packer in the country today,

23

and this isn't in the record, but I hope you wi-il pardon me,

24

but Mr. Justice Stewart, 1 think, asked this question.

7

lessening of competition in any line of commerce, they have a

from the decree.

They're not without remedy here, even apart

What the Government has tried to do here, we submit,

10
1?

Your Honor, is to just short-circuit this whole business,

32

probably out of fear that they can’t successfully maintain a

13

Section 7 case or couldn’t successfully maintain the burden of

34

modifying the decree, which is a heavy burden; the rule of

35

which has been laid down in one of the prior decisions in this

16

case.

17

And, to avoid th t burden, both the modification and

18

for proving a Section 7 violation, they have adopted this

19

arbitrary summary procedure or seek to have you sanction this

20

arbitrary summary procedure, which deprives General Host of

21

its day in court.

22
23

appropriate form of action in this area.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES R„ SPRINGER , OFFICE

3

OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

4

MR. SPRINGER:

5

Perhaps I should horrect something I may have

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

slightly misstated in answer to a question.

Of course, we

7

think what we9re asking for here is very different from any

3

hypothetical, general amendment of this decree to fry to make

9

it run against the world.

We are, of course agreed that a

iO

decree can't run against the world, and that is precisely why

IS

we haven't contended and wouldn't contend that General Host is

12

has done anything that would subject it to punishment for

13

contempt of this decree.

14

The Government filed a petition and gave General Host

15

the opportunity to have a hearing and to bring in anything

16

they wanted to bring in on the issue of whether or not it's

17

proper that this decree should give rise to a new order direc­

18

ted directly to .General Host, which then, of course, would

19

subject it to contempt punishment.

20
21

22
23

24
25

But we don'tsee that there is any issue of due
process in this case at all.

General Host--has had a hearing

and the only issue was what ought to be said at “that hearing.
If Mr. Bergson is asserting the proposition, that
it is only parties who are in direct, active concert with
parties to a decree ttho, in any way can be affected by the
31

1

decree, and I think, for one thing he's suggesting a doctrine

2

which is inconsistent with what appears to be accepted doe-

3

trine, specifically in the civil rights area, where the simple

4

fact that a man who comes in and tries to frustrate the per-

5

formance of a school desegregation decree is not working to­

6

gether with the school board against whom that decree, in

7

terms, was directed, has never been a barrier for a supplemen­

8

tal order, very much like the kind of supplemental order we're

9

asking for here against that particular individual.

10

Although Mr. Bergson acknowledges that this decree,

11

and we don't disagree'with him

12

prohibitions and structural restrictions and then turns

13

around, as I understand his argument, and treats the decree as

14

if it contained nothing but behavioral prohibitions.

15

contains the behavioral

For that reason we think that’s wrong and we think

.16

it's really beside the point to argue again and again that this

17

decree could not possibly affect General Host, because no court

18

has ever determined that General Host has done anything bad.

19

I think that argument, in substance, was rejected in

20

the earlier modification proceedings in this case, where a

2!

very similar argument was made that the bad people who made

22

Armour do bad things in the past andmade the other packers do

23

bad things, aren’t here any more.

24

of stockholders and a new management and we’re totally innocent

25

and, of course, they shouldn’t be bound by past wrongdoings of
32

Now we just have a new set

1

other people.

And I think that's really beside the point.

2

One other matter; 1 think any suggestion that the

3

fact that this decree contains a paragraph which relates to

4

what might be done by particular individuals, none of whom by

S

himself was a controlling stockholder, at least in the case of

6

Armour, I believe, to say that that means that no other parties

7

to the decree has any bearing on interlocking corporate in­

3

terests, I think simply doesn’t follow,

3

I think the problem of the individual defendants in

10

1920 was a relatively small, separate problem and that to say

11

that that precludes the Government taking action against what

12

mihgfc be a 100 percent-owned, 100 percent owning corporate

13

stockholder, I think doesn’t follow.

14

Again, for that same reason we think that any

15

attempt to say that the Government is bound because it didn’t

16

take any action against the Prince family problem, is

17

erroneous; and this is so for a number of reasons.

18

wasn’t a matter of an individtial stock ownership.

13

most, I believe by an amalgamation of people, Vh

20

of the Prince family, various people who are said, perhaps to

21

have had this kind of relationship with them. General Host

22

has managed, perhaps, to reach a3total of 13 percent stock
