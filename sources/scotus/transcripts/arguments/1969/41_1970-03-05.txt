ORAL ARGUMENT BY LON KILE, ESQ. ON BEHALF

IQ

OF PETITIONERS, THE CHOCTAW NATION-AND'

17

SPieSJVW NATION

18

MR. KILE:

19
20
21

All right, gentlemen.

Court:

Mr. Justice Black, and may it please the

The Circuit Court's decision from which this appeal

was taken, had turned on that court's construction of this

22

Court's decision in United States versus Holt — Uni-fed States

23

versus Holt State Bank.

24
25

A review of the facts in United States versus Holt
State Bank may be of some help in the discussion of its
3

1

2

application as to the facts in the case at bar»
. In United States against Holt State Bank, the

3

Chippewas ceded to the United States their right of occupancy

4

to a certain land then Minnesota»

3

States agreed to put the land up for sale and when it v?as

6

sold, to...put'the money in a trust fund to be used for the

7

benefit of the Chippewas.
Within the land that the Chippewas ceded, to the

8
9

In return, the United

United States, was a lake, called "Mud Lake."

Following the

10

treaty with the Chippewas, Minnesota became a state and later

11

Mud Lake was drained and its bed became valuable for agricul­

12

tural purposes,
After Mud Lake was drained, the Government claimed,

13
14
15
18
17
18

that it was obligated to sell the bed of Mud Lake for the
benefit of the Chippewas.

admittance to the Union, Minnesota became the owner of the bed
under the equal footing doctrine and thatfchey had succeeded to
the rights of the state.
The case presented two issues:

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

The defendants claimed that upon its

navigable?

First was the lake

And second: were the lands underlying the lake dis­

posed of by the United States before Minnesota became a state?
When the court first found that the lake was
navigable, and then it addressed itself to the question of
whether the United States had disposed of those lands before
Minnesota became a state.

4

And it was not claimed in Holt St&te Bank that

1
2

United States had made an affirmative disposition of the bed

3

of the lake, but only

4

made — that the lake was in the limits of a reservation when

5

Minnesota was admitted to the Union»

- this was the only claim that was

6

Now it in its analysis of the facts in that case, this

7

Court said; "The reservation came into being through a succes­

8

sion of treaties with the Chippewas, whereby they ceded to the

9

United States their aboriginal right of occupancy to the
surrounding land."

10

There was no formal setting apart of what was

11

ceded.

12

The effect of what was done was to reserva in a general

way for continued occupation of the Indians what remained of

13

their aboriginal territory, and thus it came to be known and

14

recognized as a reservation.

15

This Court in its decision in U» s. versus Holt State

16

Bank, referred to the Equal Footing Doctrine and said: 'First,,

17

that disposals by the United States during territorial days is

18

not likely to be inferred, and should not be regarded as in­

tended unless the intention was definitely declared or ether-

20

wise made very plain.

21

This Court, found nothing in the cession of a right of

22

occupancy in exchange for a promise that the land would be sold

23

and the money used for the benefit of the Chippewas, right­

24

fully so, I think, is even approaching a grant by the Governmen

17

20
21

22
23
24
25

remembered that, xn Holt state Bank the Chipp^was
The

Court said there was no formal setting apart of that which is
not ceded.
What the Court is there saying is this:

the

Chippewas Were the grantors; had they wanted to keep the soil
and the minerals underlying Mud Lake, they should have set them
apart from heir cession.
But in the case at bar, the shoe fits on the other

18
19

that should be allowed to stand, but it

Were the grantors and the United States was the grantee.

14
15

We "beM-eve that it’s a good decision and a

foot.

In the case now at bar the United States was the grantor

in the patents to the Cherokees of 1838 and if was the grantor
in the patent to the Chocktaws in 1842.
Applying the rule enunciated in Holt State Bank it
must be said that had the Unitd States, in its patent to the
Cherokees in 1838 and the patent to the Chocktaws in 1842,
wanted to have reserved the soil and minerals underlying any

6

1
2

portion of the IVrfegngas River, it should have done so.
Now, if you said in Holt State Bank, and we think

3

that it is a sound rule, that before the disposal of a bed of

4

navigable waters by the United States can be inferred it’s

5

intent to do so should be made very plain.

S

If it appears then in this case that 'when the Indians

7

moved from their ancestral home s in the south to the wild lands

3

in the west, it was both their intention and the intention of

9

the United States that the land s to which they were being moved

10

would never be embraced in the state or territory.

11

If it appears, from the negotiations leading upfcfco

12

the treaty, the language of the treaties themselves, that it

14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

was the intention of the Indian tribes and the intention of
the United States that the lands to which the Indians were
beingmoved would never be embraced in a state or a territory,
Then it is very plain and the test established in
Holt State Bank has been met, that the United States would
have no reason to have retained the bed of navigable streams
in these lands.

The absence: of the necessity for retaining

such a bed, coupled with the urgency associated with moving the
Indians out of the Southern States makes the intent of the
United States to dispose of the beds of the navigable streams
within those lands to which the Indians were then being moved,
very frightening.
Q

Was thetreaty with the Cherokees such that they

7

1

wouldn’t create a state without the Cherokees* consent?
A

2

That is, indeed, so.

The treaty with the

3

Choctaws said it should be theirs as long as they renaln .a

4

nation,

3

Q

When was that?

6

A

If it please,- Mr. Justice, the treaties were •

7

made with the Choctaws in 1820; withthe Cherokees in 1828?

8

another treaty with the Choctaws in 1832? a final treaty with

9

the Cherokees in 1835.

The result of these treaties were the

10

issuance of a patent, the first patent that the United States

11

Government ever gave to a tribe of Indians where it coir/eyed

12

this land in fee simple to the Cherokees in 1838, and then

13

another patent — the second patent in which the United States

14

Government had ever conveyed a fee simple title to an Indian

15

tribe to the Choctaws in 1842.

16
17

Q

Does the case depend on written documents?

A

Yes? I think so.

I think it depends — I think

18

that it depends upon the negotiations leading up to the

19

treaties and the treaties themselves.

20

Q

They would have to be in writing, I assume.

OF PETITIONERS CHEROKEE NATION, ET AL

5

MR. FORD;

All right.

If the Court please;

I think the back­

6

ground of this case has been fully covered* except I would

7

like briefly to refer to the so-called Louisiana Purchase,

8

of 1883.

9

Respondents in that their interpretation of that purchase is

There has been great weight placed upon that by the

10

that it was purchased for the purpose of the formation of

11

future states and covered by the Louisiana Purchase.

12

13

reference that provides that the inhabitants of this are that

15

they shall enjoy their freedom, their religion, the constitu­

10

tional rights that the Federal Government would afford them

17

and that the inhabitants, perhaps, at "some future date, might

18

become citizens of the United States.
There was no reference to the creation of specific

He had doubts in his own mind and

amendment was necessary to annex this territory.
He was apparently dissuaded in that position for the
treaty .*as affirmed 24 to 7, I think on Christmas Eve, 1903,,
Q

Eighteen?

h

I mean 1803 if

I dropped a century.

But, the interesting part of that is in 1802,
Georgia made.' a cession pact, ceding part of their land, and
following that to the Osages, in return for certain lands.
Then, in 1808 the Osages began negotiations for a
treaty that was ratified in 1810.

But in 1809 the Cherokees

called upon Jefferson, or they petitioned him in regard to the
way they were being treated and so forth, and that, possible
removal to the west.

And this also was in between the nego-

tiatioBg for the Osage treaty and their application.
Ih'.d, in 1909 Jefferson said, gave his blessings and
said to "My children, go forth, and seek this land"and directed

25
10

1

them to the Arkansas and the White Rivers and said, ’“the

2

higher the better," which incorporated part of the land that

3

is in contention today.

4

With reference to the treaties, the .1835 treaty,

5

in effect, incorporates, mid I'm speaking of the Cherokees,

6

the treaty of 1.817 and 1833 and 1835.

7

this Court clearly spoke that the Louisiana Purchase could not

3

enter where a tribe was granted fee simple title.

9

In Brewer V, Elliot,

Of course, in Cherokee Tobacco it was held that a

10

treaty may suspend the prior Act of Congress and an Act of

11

Congress may suspend a treaty.

12

And by later treaties, if the Louisiana Purchase had
l

13

any validity, it certainly was — I would not abrogate it,

14

but it was modified by the subsequent, treaty.

15
16
17

But the thing that shines through this case,

:;p 'ray

mind, is the core language of the treaty described in the 1833
treaty, adopted in the 1835 treaty, in the patent that was

18

adopted in 1838, and the language in the treaty, so far as the

19

land covered, was consistent with the facts of that position.

20

And, in case after case, the Cree case, ana I think

21

Holden v. Geroge and several other cases of this Court that

22

holds that we did get title in fee simple; or at least these

23

five civilised te&foes dida the Choctaws, the Cherokees, the

24

25

Crees, Seminoles and Chickasaws*
Now, as to the conveyance, it was a simple conveyance

11

1

and Holmes pointed out in the Fleming case, 215 U.S., that the

2

United States could choose to use any language they wanted but

3

it chose the simple language of conveyance thatthe average

4

citizen would understand,

Where is that quoted in your brief?

tribes and said the Congress had spoken and that’s a simple
answer to it.

And we’re in existence where any Act of

Congress, including the Act of 1894, of 1902, 1906, 1952 and
of 1962.

Arid as to the Equal Footing Doctrine
Ar.d as to the Equal Footing Doctrine, Shively v.

Bowlby, cited in 1845, there was a trust expressly created
between Virginia and Georgia prior to that time to form the
State of Alabama and the United States attempted to grant land
to a private party after statehood, in Shively v. Bowlby.
And, of course, that endrafted the so-called "public
purpose exception."

But, before the Court need reach that, it

is pointed out in our reply brief? in every case from Shively
v. Bowlby tc Holt, the case is decided upon the facts that the
12

1

territorial status existed? that there was a Government in

a

existence prior to states,

3

territory as such, other than as you speak of a territory

4

covering certain land,
Oklahoma territory did enjoin territorial status.

5

6

Indian territory never became a territory of the United States,

And, I think the public purpose in this is so obvious

7

thatit hardly needs reference.

23
24

It seeks to remove the Indians,

which is an absolute necessity, there is a compact of 1002
with Georgia which indicates the public purpose and the power
of Congress to convey this land is clear and simple and the
so-called argument that the tribe might, at sometime, cease,
then as was pointed out in the early days in a letter from one
of the Indian Commissioners in Holden v. Joy, I think, and
it?s simply an escheat provision;"if we cease, the land goes
back. *'

had thought •,
A

No? I don’t think that’s for the Court to

decide, anyway.

The principal production, I think, is gas

instead of oil.

And Mr. Kirk would be far better informed

on that subject than 1.

Well, for what purpose can the Indians us it

A

Sir?

Q

For what purpose can the Indians use it except

for the gas?

Or oil?

A

Well, they could use the revenue.

Of the streams?

A

They could use the revenue derived from the bed

of the stream if a particular bed was productive of oil, gas —
Q

Well, that’s what it’s about, mainly; isn’t it?

A

It happens to be gas.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, OFFICE
OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL, AS AMICUS CURIAE
FOR THE UNITED STATES
14

MR. CLAIBORNE:

?

Mr. Justice Black, and may it please

2

the Court:

3

of Oklahoma in order to claim the bed of the navigable portion

4

of the Arkansas River, which is in dispute here.

5

There are really two arguments made by .the State

The first is that these Indian tribes never obtained

6

title to the beds.

The second is that if they did they lost

7

it, at some subsequent time.

8

As to. the first proposition —

9

Q

Lost it how?

10

A

Well, they would say

11

12

13
14
15
16

17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

while they don't press

these arguments, they are suggested here and there.

I cake xt

that they are not pressed as their main arguments.

Lost by

voluntary relinquishment in the 1390s, just

prior to state­

hood, that is just prior to Oklahoma's statehood.

It was

either taken from them or that they gave it away whan they
agreed to an allotment of their land or were forced to give up
their lands.
The second of these arguments would be that they
ceased to exist as a nation and, therefore, under the terms of
the grants, these communal tribal lands reverted to the United
States and In turn, inured to the State of Oklahoma.
That is an argument which is barely suggested by
Oklahoma and I hope not seriously pressed.
More seriously, I think they suggest that neither
tribe, the Choctaws and Chickasaws together, nor the Cherokees,
15

I

ever obtained title to the bed of the river.

There are only

2

two arguments in that respect: the first is that as a technical

3

matter of conveyancing, these treaties and patents did not

4

embrace the bed of the river.
The second is that even if the patents broadly em­

5
6

brace the bed, there was an implied reservation by the United

7

States in these grants for the benefit of some future state.
As to the first proposition: I think what is most,

25

noteworthy when one faces down the various descriptions • the
various treaties and the various patents is that the grunt to
the Cherokees and the grants to the Choctaws always define one
with relation to the other.

The boundary between them is

spoken of as a common corner, "the Cherokee corner," or the
"Choctaw corner," at the extreme downward point of the Arkansas
River.
There are references to the river which talk about
"down the main channel," which doesn't sound like ’along the
north bank."
Finally, and I think most persuasive, is the almost
unthinkable proposition that in grants of this size and as for
the: little map I had prepared for the Court indicates, the
whole of the State of Oklahoma, except the panhandle, was
granted to three Indian tribes: the Cherokees at the north;
the Crees and Seminoles in the center; the Choctaws and the
Chickasaws at the bottom.

Each of these grants is of a huge
16
i

I

tract of land
In the case of the Cherokees, it's approximately

2

3

million acres? roughly three times the size of Maryland, The

4

Choctaw and Chickasaw grant is considerably larger.

4

All of this territory west of the Arkansas boundiry

5
6

was intended to be and to remain Indian territory.

7

enormous grants to what were then described as “nations ■ "

8

meant to remain forever as quasi“independent, quasi-sovereign

9

states,
It is unthinkable, I think, that the river beds

10

!
12

were meant to be left out when all of this territory went of
the line was confined to the tribes as a contiguous grant,

Picking up from Mr, Justice Marshall’s question,

west of a certain boundary, which ultimately was the boundary
of the State of Arkansas, should be Indian lands, a whole
north territory which includes present Oklahoma and some other
lands,
Subsequently it was determined to divide that
acreage between these several tribes.

The exact descriptions

of that division should not be dispositive as to whether all
of that Indian country was then meant to be and to remain an
Indian territory.
From that point on, from the 1820s on, and later
when this territory was called the "Indian Territory,” nobody
ever thought any portion of it had been kept back.

The exact

boundaries between the several grants were matters of soma

Some of the grants originally were overlapping, were

2

found to be overlapping and have been corrected.
But, the general picture, and I think this is a fair

statement is that all that land was meant to be Indian land

Q

When did it arise over the bottom of the river?

A

Well, the letter from the Interior Department,

which is printed at the back of our brief, in 1908, indicates
at that time there was already some question as to whether the
state or the tribes owned the bed.

At that time it was simply

sand and gravel removal? it was not oil or gas.
The avalue of the bed at that time, I suppose, was

23
24

Yes»

when Oklahoma became a state,

17

19

Q

minimal.

And they say also that to th© extent that these

tribes are taxed with not having brought this suit earlier, it
21

1

is not at all clear — in fact it is assumed

z

Nation versus Georgia that these tribes had no standing of

3

their own to bring a suit in a Federal Court, and of course,

4

they couldn't bring on in the state court without the(l consent

S

of the state.

6

It was only in your opinion, Mr. Justice Black, in

1

the Creek case in 318 U.S., decided in 1944,, that for the very

8

first time it was said — it wasn't a. holding it was a dictum,

9

but it was a clear dictum, that these nations, so-called, these

10

civilized tribes did have standing to file a suit without a

special Act of Congress authorizing it.

Act of Congress passed to —

I don't think up until that time.

The Act of

1344, that still leaves some time betweenthen and the time
the suit was filed 20 years later.

4

Mr. Justice Black in that opinion in the Creek case, as

authority, there is another cited which is really not a good

8

test, because it was filed pursuant to a special Act of

7

Congress.
What I meant to say was that all of these suits,

8

10

with that possible exception, were filed pursuant to specific
authorizations from the Congress.

11

Q

Special bills were passed.

12

A

Special bills ware passed, usually ever since

13

the Court of Claims.
■■ might' say that even this suit could not have been

14
15
16

brought under the decisions of this Court, but for the consent
granted by Oklahoma, a waiver of its sovereign immunity.
We don't know whether Oklahoma was at all times

17
18

willing to consent to the suit by these tribes.
Finally, I should say in fairness,, that the tribes

19
20

2t
22
23
24
25

approached the Department of the Interior some years ago,
seeking to have the United States file this suit on behalf of
the tribes, which has been an established practice.

The

Department of the Interior did not refuse to do so, but it
took its

time in processing the request and ultimately the

tribes brought their own suits.
23

I don’t mean to imply for a moment that the Depart­

I

z

ment of Interior and the Department of Justice are not fully

3

in support with the Petitioners here as, indeed, my presence

4

indicates, and the Government appeared likewise in the courts

This is not its first appearance.

Chief Justice Marshall, indicated to what extraordinary extent
these tribes, these civilized tribes were independent nations,,
They were held not to be foreign states, but they were held in
every other respect to be independent political sovereignties.
Under those circumstances, and considering also the
terminology of the grants, which I remind the Court were in
terms of a See simple title; in terras of a permanent horae for
these tribes of Indians.

And with a special assurance that at

no future time would a state be carved out or surround them.
It seems to us that one cannot realistically suppose
that there was any intention to retain for the benefit of the

24

future state, the beds of the navigable rivers thatraight

2

exist within that enormous territory now ceded for the benefit

of the tribes.

A

In this Court's opinion in. Brewer-Elliot, in

260 U.S., the Court these accepted the findings of the twocourts below, that the head of navigation on the Arkansas River
was just above Fort

Gibson, at the confluence of the Grand

River and the Arkansas River, which is the point from which
this dispute arises.
That case, incidentally, the Brewer-Elliot decision
says in so many words that the reserved doctrine under which
the beds of all navigable rivers ara all reserved, may not be

applicable with respect to these grants, that being granted the

Is there a conflict between fcheChoetaws and the

The Red River in this Court’s decision in

11

Q

The entire bed?

\Z

A

The entire bed, where their allotment fell.

13

So, that dispute was only about a small portion of the Red

14

Fiver, which was in what was called the ’"leased district."of

15

the Choctaw grant.

18

Even if the Equal Footing Doctrine is applicable, it

17

is recognised that there is an exception where the: United

18

States, for a public purpose grants the bed of the river; does

19

not reserve it.

20

Here, the

public purpose is to satisfy the claims of

21

the Eastern Seaboard States as. to whom the United States had

22

promised to extinguish Indian title and it’s resulting obliga­

23

tion to the Indian tribes to find a new home for the;;', and to

24

maintain the peace in avoiding new laws.

25

All of those- important public services
27

1

were determinative in helping the Government settle the tribes

2

west of this Arkansas line and in a way that gives them an

3

absolutely protected boundary into which no white man was

4

permitted, except by leave of the governmentsof these tribes.
Q

5

Wouldn't it be true that if the United States

6

granted the lands to the Cherokees or the Choctaws, say, just

How, without regard to any presumptions or Equal

9
10

11

Cherokee* would have been limited to the banks, because you

would be in argument that the terms of this entire area had
been carved out, not so much as a land grant, but as a politics 1
grant that the — just as the state would own the bed, so here,
the intents was that these tribes as nations would stand in the
shoes of a state with all attained rights.

If there is any

Equal Footing argument here it's that the nations who received
these territories ought to stand on an equal footing with the
other territories created from the Louisiana Purchase.
And the suggestion that Oklahoma is being treated as
a second class state is rather out of place? it's the Indian
28

3

nations that are being treated as second class grantees if

2

they are deprived of the bed.

S

We would certainly strain to avoid a result which

4

would leave a strip of land in the middle of Indian country

5

Q

6

Well, I suppose you would concede that the

I would say that with respect to the suggestion that somehow

in locating the Cherokee and Choctaw boundary lines, particu­

9

larly the Cherokee, and locating the Cherokee and Choctaw

10

12
13

corners at or near Fort Smith.
Now, the trial court found and its finding was not
challenged, that this sketch of the Arkansas River was
navigable in fact, and in law at the time the western domain,

U

now a part of Oklahoma, was ceded to-the Choctaw Nation and to

15

the Cherokee Nation arid at the time treaties were made,

16

pursuant to which the lands were ceded.

n

that Oklahoma was aclmitted to statehood on November 3.6, 1907.

20
21

22
23

25

And also at the time

We consider the fact of established navigability at
the time these treaties were made to be a very important fact.
That was so found at: the t

al court and has not been challenge a

in this case.
Now, we, in substance * * rest our case on the laws
governing navigable waters as laid down by this Court:, par­
ticularly in the case of Pollard versus Eagan, Shively versus
Bowlby and U.S.&. versus Holt State Bank.
40

in the case of Pollard versus Hagan, Mr, Justice

1

2

McKinley in an opinion written in 1845, referring to an opinior

3

written in .1842 by Mr. Justice Taney, said, in the case of.

4

Martin, et al, versus Jaddell 16 Peters, 410.

5

Chief Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the Court,

6

said;

7

state became themselves self-solving, and in that character

3

hold the absolute right to all their navigable waters and the

9

soils under them for their own common use, subject only to the

rights since surrendered by the Constitution."
In the case of Pollard versus Hagan the Court went

11
12

The present

on and said; "We have arrived at these general conclusions;
first, the shores of navigable waters, the soils under them

U

were not granted by the Constitution to the United States, but

15

they are reserved to the states respectively.

16

new states have the same rights; sovereignty and jurisdiction

17

over this subject as the original states."
The State of Oklahoma was admitted on an equal

24
25

Secondly, the

footing with the original states and we say that this law is
applicable as set forth in the case of Martin versus Waddell
and this case of Pollard versus Hagan is still applicable to­
day.
Now, the most complete, eradite opinion that has
been written

on the subject of the rights of the states with

respect to navigable waters, was written by Mr. Justice Gray
4.1

IN that case

in the case of Shively versus Bowlby in .1893«

fir. Justice Gray comment that this was an occasion suitable

3

for a complete review of the law as had been developed.

4

went back to the beginning to the common lav? of England as

5

applied to the American Colonies, to the common law as applied

6

after the Revolution,

7

that had been handed down since then and wrote, what seems to

8

us to be a guiding opinion, in this litigation.

He reviewed the whole range of decisions

Wow, ha did say that he, when the United States

9
10

acquires a territory it does have administrative jurisdiction

11

over it and it holds it in trust for the formation of future

12

states.

13

necessary, by the United States during territorial periods.

Now, he says certain dispositions can be made when

He said, "We cannot doubt therefore that Congress has.

14
15

the power to make grants of land, the low-high water mark of

18

navigable waters in any territory of the United States.

17
18
19

20
21

22

Whenever it becomes necessary to do so, first, in order to
perform international obligations? second, to effect the im­
provement of such lands for the promotion and convenience of
commerce, with foreign nations and among the several states?
or, third, to carry out otherpublic purposes appropriate to the
objects for which the United States holds the territory,”
Mow, he goes further in that opinion and he defines

23
24

25

what the objects for which the United States holds the terri­
tory are.

And withrespect to that he said this? "And the
42

1

territories acquired by Congress, whether by deed of cession

2

from the original states or by

3

are held with the object as soon as their population and con­

4

viction is justified, ba admitted info the Union as states,

5

upon an equal footing with the original states in all respects.

8

The Congress of theUnite! States, in disposing of the public

7

lands has constantly acted upon the theory that those lands

8

whether in the interior or on the coast, above high-water mark,

9

may be taken up by actual occupants in order to encourage the

10

treaty with a foreign country

settlement of the country.
"But the navigable water and the soils under them,

12

whether within or above the ebb and flow of the tide, shall be

13

and remain public highways and be chiefly valuable for the

14

public purposes of commerce, navigation and fishery and for the

15

improvements necessary to secure and promote those purposes

16

shall not be granted away during the period of territorial

17

government.
"But, unless, in case of some international duty or

Or public exigency.

No.

We will mention the one before -- the first-

three that we mentioned before, "perform international dMifS™

2

4
5

And they define the objects for which to hold a
i
territory„ as being "for the formation of a future state, or

6

future states?'5 that is the object.

certainly would not be one of the objects for which the United
States holds the territory; yes, sir*

44

Q

1

Well, yes

would you say then that the patent

to the Indians, to the extent that it covered the navigable

riverbed would be invalid?

Unconstitutionally?

I think it would be? yes,

Q

All right.

20

A

Inths case of the United States versus Holt

21

State Bank, and I might say that we differ on the facts of the

22,

opinion in that case and the counsel for the Choctaws, who has

23
24
25

argued previously.

We have set forth, however, our under­

standing of the facts and the holding of that case at phgse
35 to 37 of our brief and we refer to the Court to that.
45

I
!

1

won81 go into that in detail here at this time.
But, to get in that case, the Court actually, re­

2
3
4
5

6
7
3
9
10

affirmed the principles laid down in Shively versus Bewiby ,
where they said "the United States earlier adopted and con­
stantly has adhered to the policy of regarding lands under
navigable waters in acquired territories while under its sole
dominion, as held for. the ultimate benefit of future states
and so has refrained from making any disposal thereof, save ini
exceptional instances when impelled to particular disposals
by some international duty or public exigency.
wXt'follows from this that disposals by the United

11

12
13
14

States during the territorial period are not lightly to be
inferred and should not be regarded as intended unless the
intention was definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.
That language was used with respect to a statute,

15
16

a United States statute in the form of a treaty with the
Chippewas, which set aside a reservation, a Mud Lake reserva­

17

tion.

Within the reservation was a navigable lakes Mud Lake.

18

Mvid Lake was not mentioned as being conveyed to the

19

Chippewas and the Court held it was not conveyed, because there
20
21

was not a specific reference to Mud Lake in the patent.
That was the holding of this Court in Holt State

22
Bank.

We say that applies with respect tothe Arkansas River,

23

and particularly with respect to the part where: Cherokeos have
24
25

land on each side.

46

Now, there is, with respect to the Chippewa title,

1

2

which has been in question here, that title,, we think, is a

3

good reservation title? it has been so-defiaed and held in
versus Hitchcock, 185 U.S, 373 and a similar type

4
f

5

of title has been affirmed in the United States versus the

6

Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Company, 314 U.S, 339, with respect

Now, coming to the Cherokee treaties on the Cherokee

21

patent and subject that you expressed particular interest in,

22

Mr. Justice White, the western Cherokees first land in Okla­

23

homa was acquired pursuant, to the Treaty of 1828 7 Stat.311.

24

In that treaty it was agreed that 7 million of acres
of land, plus an outlet west, should be conveyed to the

The description of the land was incomplete and

The 1833 Treaty with the Western Cherokees also
covered the same lands substantially, except that down toward
the lower part the boundary line between the Creeks and the
Cherokees were straightened out and settled? whereas, under the
1828 Treaty it was left open, up in the air, you might say.
But that boundary was left open, too, on the north­
westerly side, but the parties had in mind having a survey arid
they did have

a survey.

It was conducted shortly ~ work on

it was clone shortly after the 1828 Treaty under the direction
of the Reverene Isaac McCoy,, who was commissioned to do this
surveying by the War Department.
The map which we have provided for the Court here is
the result, the final result of the surveying work clone unde?.'
Reverend McCoy and is the basis for the description in the
Cherokee patent.
The field notes which we have provided — with which
we have provided the Court with copies, on an enlarged basis,
both of which are in our brief in the appendices, describe the
first line that was run by that surveying crew under McCoy's

48

1

direction by a surveyor by the name of Donaldson.
In that line he ran the line between the State of

2
3

Arkansas and the Cherokees on the west and the State of

4

Arkansas on the east.

5

then he uses as a reference point the land — the Choctaw

6

Corner across the river which he fixes upon the south bank of

7

the river .and he sets the Cherokee's corner on the north bank

8

of the river.

And it comes down to this corner and

Now, the Cherokee ~

11

Yes? yes* that's on the Arkansas line just west

of Fort Smith.

The line that was run north from where the

between Arkansas and the Cherokees.
Now, you met **» in those field notes, of which you

At this point affixed the southeast corner of the

change to the south bank where the northern extremity of the
eastern boundary of the Choctaw line strikes the river." And
he does that for a reference point.
He is surveying the Cherokee boundaries, but he's

10

referring to another point which helped set up his point, the
11

12

Cherokee corner on the north bank of the river.
Q

But then he says, "thence along the channel of

13
14

the river," rather than along the north bank of the river.
A

l know. " Md the north bank he says.

15
q

I thought you read "along the channel of the

18
17

river?
A

After he affixes the north bank —

q

Well, it crosses from the point on the north

18
19
bank to the point on the south bank, he has to cross the river

20

to get there.
A

That5 s right.

q

There the river runs north and south instead

22
23
of east and west, where they would have to go along the channel

And there he fixes the Choctaw corner.

So, he fixea the Cherokee corner qb the north bank liad the

Choctaw corner on the south bank.

Now,

they were.
Now, the Cherokee patent, conveys its land, covers
this land, pursuant to the survey — to Isaac McCoy's survey,
refers to the description from the survey.

That patent was

dated December 31, 1838 and found in Appendix 9 of ©ur brief.

Q

Yes, tout you couldn’t argue — argue and say tha':

patent follows the survey whan the

The patent, which I say is found in Appendix 9 of

Right? right.

corner given by the field notes of the survey.

A

Wo it is not in the record.

We say that now we have another argument before by
Appellants to which I should give some note here.

They have

argued that because there were provisions in the treaties, that
at no time would the lands ceded to them be included within
the boundaries of a territory or a state.

They contended that

therefore, there could not have been any holding in trust by
the United States far a future territory or state.
We say that that conclusion is erroneous and faulty.
We say that the Cherokee® treaty in particular, says "without
their consent.5'

That practically implies that their consent

could be sought and obtained and they might have it in mind.
We have cited Congressional Reports and other data
which shows that Sature states were contemplated in this area.

FOR PETITIONERS CHOCTAW NATION AND CHICKASAW NATION
MR. FORD;

Yes, sir.

I had .hoped we wouldn't turn

the Court into engineers, but apparently we have.

So, I wish

that you would compare the cause of the survey and the patent
owned by the Cherokees and they read the same in reverse.
So far as I can tell, there is a difference between
47 and 53 degrees? they might have gone around a tree.

We have

lever claimed over half of the river? it's clearly stated in
the patent and it's not inconsistent with the treaty.
Two, Justice Read in Alabama v. Texas, speaking of
disposal of public lands and the Equal Footing Doctrine, in a

concurring opinions said specifically; "The United States has

2

power to dispose of its public lands under the so-called

states on an economic basis, but on a political basis *" Each

I would like to call the Court's specific attention
to the enabling Act of Oklahoma, which is cited on page 26 of
our brief and the Oklahoma Constitution, which specifically
provides that these Indian tribes will be protected in the
possession of their lands*
And the previous Act which was referred to by Mr.
Kiris under quote of law, as extinguishing the tribe, is simply

without meaning.
The Court, so far as the map is concerned, and with­
out relationship to what value there is, I don't know.
Certainly on February 23th in the Sdate of Arkansas v.
Tennessee, met and answered the same question concerning
evulsion, accretion or erosion, whether it be by natural or
artificial means.

above-entitled matter was concluded)
