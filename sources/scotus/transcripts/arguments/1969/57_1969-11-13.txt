Q

Mr. Clifford, X want to be sure X fully under­

21

stand the facts.

X think you said, if I understand it

22

correctly that these men not only picked up what was on the

23

table, but also personally went into the pockets of each one

24

of the players?

!

Yes, Your Honor, and 1 was going to give you

proposition.

I first stated the general

The question is a curious one: as to whether there

were three or four of the alleged robbers who came in, but

11

in any event, after they had performed this robbery these

left*
So that just taking Ashe alone, the Petitioner here,
he had six informations filed against him, alleging the sir
offenses against the poker players.
!

But when-the first trial came on, four of the
poker players were called as witnesses.

Among a number of

other witnesses — the fast is that 15 witnesses were called
i.

by the State in this first trial against Ashe.
Gl&dson, at whose house the game was held, identi­
fied one of the robbers, a man named Brown.

Because, as the

robbers came in they had hats on?-they had bandanas around
their face and were difficult to identify, but in. the course

4

1

of the proceedings Brown’s bandana fell down and Gladson

2

identified him»

He knew him there in town so he identified

him but could not identify any of the others»
4

Knight, the second witness at the first trial, said

5

he had heard that some people claimed there were four men in

6

the holdup and he only recalled three arid he couldn't identify

7

any of the three»

8
9

McClendon, the third poker player said that he
remembered only three men in the basement and he identified

10

all three of them as Johnson, Larson and Brown.

it

about Ashe at this particular stage and he said, "no, he

12

couldn’t remember seeing Ashe in the basement in where they

13

ware having the game»

14

~

He was asked

Roberts, the fourth member of the game did identify

15

Ashe as one of the robbers, but. in a curious manner.

16

I didn’t see his face that evening in the room where the poker

n

game was held; I didn’t see his hands, for these men all had

18

gloves on, and 1 really couldn't identify his voice, but Ashe

19

was one of the robbers and he’s sitting over there at the tria3

20

table when the case came to trial and that is Ashe and he was

21

one of them»

He said,

.

22

From there the trial — the first trial went then to

23

the question that the robbers escaped, stole one of the cars

24

belonging to the poker players and escaped.

2S

Early that next morning
5

witnesses saw this group and

two or three witnesses saw the stolen car with three men in

I

.

2

or around it; one lying on the ground next to it? two sitting

3

on the other side.

4

And the next morning, Sunday morning, maybe eight

/

5

o’clock or so, these three men were picked up.

e

Johnson, Larson and Brown.

7

Clendon, incidentally, had recognized in the basement.

men picked up near the stolen car, all had money on thems

\z

kind of currency that had been used in the poker game.

13

the stolen car was found near which one witness had seen these

14

three men; a shotgun was found some few steps behind the car;

15

two pistols ware found inside of the car.

Then
r

•

Hot*?, some time later at a point removed from this

16
17

location where the three men were found, Ashe was walking

18

along the highway and a separate stata patrolman was driving

19

along, saw this man walking along the highway, stopped him aad

20

the word had gone out to be on the lookout for this particular

21

fellow.

22

stand with his hands against the automobile, and searched him.

23

All Ashe had on at the time was a pair of pants and a

He arrested him at the time, had him ©me over and

24

white shirt.

And the officer said he had nothing in his

25

pockets? he had no money of any kind.
6

I mention this because

1

the identification of Ashe was extraordinarily flimsy from the

2

witnesses who were in the game.

3

three who were supposedly implicated were quite strong,

4

because they ware found with money on them? they pretty well

stayed together? they had-been seen near the car and so forth„j

Ashe was separate.

might have just been walking down the highway and the police­

man saw him.

After the submission of the case to the jury, the

10

that the poker game took place.

14

There is no doubt that they lost

All ©f that is uncontroverted.

It went in?

So, we have those facts established with any doubt

15

or question.

The one real question, however, was was Ashe

16

one of the men?

17

for instance, saying that there were only three men and they

18

were Johnson, Larson and Brown, and I didn't see any of them.

It was greatly complicated by McClendon,

i

10

Other men said, wall, I don’t know who they were.

20

So, that by the time the jury had to consider it, a reading

21

of the record showed that they really had but on© issue sub-

22

mitted to them.

23

Q

Was if the State's theory at all that four men

24

were «involved, but that only three came into the basement and

25

that the other was the driver of the get-away oar or anything
8

1

along those lines?
A

2

It was not explained.

The State alleged that

o

there were four men and whether three came in all alone and

4

then one came in afterwards, there was a good deal of con­

§

fusion.

e

actually four robbers at some time or another in the basement.

But the State's charge was, in effect, there were

Q

7

Is it not normal or usual in a situation where

8

you have three people or four people robbing or committing

9

some other crime against four or five or six that you have

10

this kind of a confused picture where the •identifications

u

aren’t always precise or the identifications or the particular

is

movements aren’t always precise.
A

13

If is not uncommon.

It is not uncommon, is it?
I am sure that with the

14

excitement of the moment and with these men coming in, the

15

fact that they had their faces concealed, I think all of that

16

is likely to create difficulty in identification.

of the six was all put. into the case and the one real question \

the jury had to determine is: was Asha one of the four men?

And he now, between the

are bolstered up.
Here is a perfect illustration;

Obviously the pro­

20

just had a pair of trousers and a shirt on and had no money of

21

23
24

any kind on him.

S

So, at the second trial an effort was made to show
that he did have some money on him, but they couldn't get it ir

on the first statement of tha/patrolman, that he had searched
Ashe and found nothing on him.
-i...~"X1

So, they put on a Deputy
.“

1

Sheriff who was at the jail in Jackson County and this, it

2.

seems to me, is really quite significant.

3

two or three questions and answers.

4

5

He said lie had found some money on Ashe.

"Where was j

the money?"
"A

7

I want to read just

In his pocket.

He had soma in his coat pocket,

I think.

8

t!Q

Did he have some in his shoe or sock?

0

"A

That is the mistake I made.

'IO

fi

I got it all out

of the pocket of his coat."
Well, that's a little troublesome to the State because

12

he never had a coat.

13

with just pants and shirt and ha had never had a coat on.

14

Then this:

15

"Q

16
17

They found him at the very beginning

Didn't you tell me prior to this you took it

out of his shoes?
"A

Ho.

I said I made him take his shoes and socks

18

off. That was a misunderstanding because I had heard it four

10

or. five times."

2

©'

Sometime between the first trial and the second trial ;
i

21

this pafcicular witness had had suggested to him four or five

j

22

times that ha had found soma money in Ashe's shoe between his

,

23

sock and his shoe, because there was no evidence of any kind

24

about any money inhis shoe in the first place.

25

And to compound what I believe is the gross injustice
12

1

here: although this witness, whose name is Otto Ray, the

?,

Deputy Sheriff who took his shoes and socks off, had testified

3

at -the first trial anci said nothing about finding any money

4

in his shoes and socks at the first trial»

5

in the second trial was very anxious to get this deputy

6

sheriff to i'say that and when he didn’t say it, then the

7

Deputy Sheriff claimed surprised and asked me to cross-examine

8

him as a hostile witness, although he had testified six weeks

3

before at another first trial, he never mentioned about the

Q

Now, was he impeached with these inconsistencies?

A

Yes.

And the Court permitted him to do it and

Attorney trying to get this deputy sheriff to say that he
found the money in his shoe»
Q

But then the jury had all of this picture

before it mid resolved these conflictsJ did it not?'
A

They did, Your Honor»

I

And the second time they'

said — they brought in a verdict of guilty and it was on that
guilty finding that he was sentenced to serve the term in the j
penitentiary„
Now, the point is that it is our contention on behalfj
of Ashe, that the substance, the thrust of the double jeopardy!
clause of the Fifth Amendment is carried over into the Due
Process Clause of the 14th Amendment»
13

And it is our contention

I
I

that after he was acquitted of the first trial when there was

2

only one real issue, and that is: was Ashe there?

3

then became the finding of the jury and he should not have

4

been tried again on that issue.

5

That that

That is the contention that

How, in this regard when our brief was filed there

was a Federal rule regarding - the application of double

jeopardy and a state rule»

decision in State versus Paiko, with Justice Cardoso, it seems

It was perhaps best stated by the

10

to me»

11

that there was one rule for Federal cases and one rule fox-

12

state cases»

13

requirement was leveled against the state.

Justice Cardoso in the Paiko case who said, 51 We will not dis­

15

turb a second finding of guilty in a state case unless the

16

hardship is so shocking and acute as to be unendurable»”

17

That9® his substantial language and the Paiko decision was

18

followed for quite a long time»

19

The State versus Paiko where it misalleged and held

And in the state case a very watered-down
T think it was

Now, that was changed, but I'll get tothat»

We con­

20

tend that even in this instance when there is but one issue in

21

a case end the case has full opportunity to present its case,

22

and the one clear issue is decided in favor of the defendant

23

in that case, that he should not be tried again for the charge

,24

for which the jury has obviously found one positive result.

25

So, we say that even if Paiko were the law today,

14

1

with this wate;red-down requirement, X believe that this case

2

would still corae under the rule enunciated in P&lko, but the

3

Palko case is no longer controlling in this regard, because of

' 4

the case of Benton versus Maryland in which Justice Marshall

5

wrote the opinion in June of this year»

6

this Court said that the double jeopardy concept — the

1

double jeopardy theory — the core of the concept of double

3

jeopardy applies to the states through the 14th Amendment.

Because, as the Opinion of Judge Marshall said,

threatened either one of these first two people?

The evidence is essentially that at the second

trial, and I believe at the first trial, once again that
the people who came down in the basement, Your Honor, with
the guns, forced the six participants in the om:& game to go

19

over against the wall at one point.

He apparently had the benefit of the

testimony at the■first trial that ha was able to use in crossexamination for purposes of impeachment.
And so under those circumstances where yea do have

level of fundamental unfairness.

first of all, that there is not a collateral estoppel because

We submit that there «as

and that collateral estoppel was not applicable upon the facts

of the case, that perhaps more importantly, we suggest that

collateral estoppel need not be applied by this Court simply

5

because Ashe indicated in this Court's decision in Hoag versus

6

Hew Jersey there was a reluctance to declare the principle of

7

collateral estoppel as a constitutional principle that was

applicable to the state action and we submit that the acme

Supreme Court of Missouri "and in the Federal District Court,
in the Federal Court of. Appeals and here, has cited the Hoag

sentence when he was tried on exactly the same issue.

Supreme Court of New Jersey in the Cormayer case and they

specifically referred to the Hoag case and the Cormayer case

and suggest, they are not going to follow that rule any longer.;

n

And the language of the Cormayer decision, now in the New

Jersey Supreme Court is that collateral estoppel should be

13

ungrudgingly applied in this type of case.
Also 1 submit to you that Hoag is no longer an

15

authority in this case because Benton has changed Hoag also.

16

Because Hoag comments on the fact that there are two rules:

17

one rule that's quite beneficial to defendants in Federal

18

cases and one that is really hardly at all in the

cases.

Also, in .the Hoag case this Court said, "We're not

So, 1 say Hoag is no longer an authority of the ease.

The Judge said, "In view of the wide publicity
