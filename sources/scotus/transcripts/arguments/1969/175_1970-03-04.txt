ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. HARDEE:

Number 175, PetSOT©11©

the Court:

Hr. Chief Justice and may it please

.Edward Moragne, Sr., was a longshoreman employed in

m

the Port of Tampa by Gulf Florida Terminal Corporation, which

ii

is & Respondent in this case, and was his employer, as a

12

stevedore.

13

On December 31, 1964 he was killed when a hatch

14

beam fell, came loose arid fell down in the bottom of the hole

IS

where he was discharging the cargo on the S.S. PALMETTO STATE,

16

a vessel owned by the Respondent States Marine Lines, Inc.

17
18

vessel was docked at the pier in Tampa, on navigable waters
of the United States.

26

His widow, the plaintiff, Petsonella Moragne, for
»
herself and hex* two minor children, filed suit in the State

21

Court on four counts; two counts under the State9s wrongful

22

death act, claiming damages under that act? one count of

23

negligence and one of unseaworthiness.

19

24
23

The

And two counts under

the State’s Survival Act for damages, as personal representable e
for damages to the estate.
3

1

The two issues removed at the instance of States

2

Marine Lines, Inc. to the Federal District Court in Tampa.

3

And then upon motions by both Respondents, after a third

4

party complaint was filed for indemnity by the shipowner

5

against the stevedore.
The District Judge struck Count 2 which had to do

€

1

with unseaworthiness, and based his decision.upon two cases

8

of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Graham against

9

10
!1

A. Lusi, Ltd. and Emerson versus Holloway Concrete Products
Company» which held that Florida common lav? applied and was
applicable under the Florida Wrongful Death Statute,,
One of these cases was decided in 1953? the other

12

13
14

was decided with a vigorous dissent by Judge Brown in I960,
right after this Court issued its opinion in the Tungus.
But, the District Judge was concerned about the

15
10
17
18
19

20
2%

correctness of his ruling, and pursuant to the appropriate
rule, gave language in his opinion which allowed us to petition
for an interlocutory appeal to the Court of Appeals,.

of Appeals granted our interlocutory appeal and then, upon the
request of the Respondent States Marine Lines, certified the
question involved to the Florida Supreme Court.
The Florida Supreme Court held that the warranty of

22

,23
24

The Court

seaworthiness is not applicable under the Florida Wrongful
Death Act.
We then requested the Court of Appeals to ignore

25

4

1

this opinion or the certified question of the Florida Supreme

2

Court* and raised the constitutions! questions which are here

3

before this Court»

4

made to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals took- con­

5

siderable time worrying with the issue* and finally its

6

opinion said they felt nevertheless bound by the Tungus to

7

accord to the Florida Supreme Court r or the Florida courts

8

the right to decide what section of law was applicable to

Florida Supreme Court has now held that this State, these two

Harrisburg, it seems to me a plaintiff would have to sue for

Youhave never gone to the

12

we felt and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals agrees with it,
we felt was the compulsion of the majority ruling in the
Tungus, and every other state since Tungus, which has decided
this question? some 11 maj$>r Maritime States have held that
the Wrongful Death Statutes of both states incorporate
Admiralty Substantive Law.
Q

13

14

IS
16
17

I'm just telling you my guess, Your Honor.

It's only in this case —

But in Tungus andfche Harrisburg, the cause of

action was in the Admiralty and the holding was that there is
no cause of action for wrongful death in Admiralty, but that
Admiralty may, in the event of wrongful death, may borrow from
the local state statute.
But hare you sue underthe local state statute.

of the Court, but the Maritime Law applied under the Florida
Wrongful Death Statuta,

11

Q

14

Is it your claim thatthe Admiralty Law would

require a state to have its death statute incorporated into
Maritime Lav/?
A

12
13

This has been the position of the

plaintiff from the beginning.

9

10

This is the whole I

Yes, sir.

It's my claim that Maritime Sub­

stantive Law must apply under the State's Wrongful Death
Statute to a maritime death which occurs on the navigable waters
of fchs United States, within the territorial jurisdiction.

15
Q

Could 1 ask a question about the Harrisburg?

A

Ho, sir, I haven’t gotten to the Harrisburg

16
17
yet.

I'd be glad to talk about the Harrisburg, but ~~

18
Q

If that's the only claim you never will get to

19
the Harrisburg.
20
A

Yes, sir.

So that what happened, in effect, in

21
this case is that the Court of Appeals applied Florida Law to

32
a maritime death occtiring within the territorial waters of
23
Florida, under the compulsion of the Tungus,
24
Arid a flat section of law which conflicted, with the
25

8

1

duties and obligations which are rooted in maritime law,

2

speaking there of the warranty of seaworthiness,

3

question but what the warranty of seaworthiness is a duty and

4

an obligation of a shipowner which is owed to a longshoreman.

5

And in the case of injury, a violation of this duty produces

6

the right to sue.
Q

7

There is no

In other words — and you couldhave sued, Mr„

8

Hardee, I gather, in the case of an injury? not a death.

had your option to proceed in the Federal Court or in the

State Court.

11

A

Yes, sir.

12

Q

But in eithercourt, not

case,the

13

controlling law that would have to be applied would be the

14

Federal Maritime Law.

Yes, sir? that's right.

I say, first of all

overruled.

that Meredith Moran has been decided that the theories ex­
pressed by the minority in fungus, have come to fruition, and
9

i

the State of Florida has caused to be applied to maritime

2

deaths in Florida/ a rule different from the substantive

3

Admiralty rule or lav.
So that I think if this Court receives from the

4
3
6

majority reasoning in Tungus and does what the minority
suggests/ my client is protected in this case.
This Court asked the parties to brief the question

7
8

9

of whether the Harrisburg should be overruled and I have taken
the position that it should foe, for a number of reasons*
First of all, the Harrisburg, of course, is a very

•10

It
12
13
!4
15

careful, we11-reasoned and thought-out decision»

The problem

is that I think the Court in the Harrisburg at that time went
astray on a couple of matters.

First of all, the civil law

had traditionally been the law applied to Admiralty in England
and in this country.

The courts generally looked to the civil

law.
16
Mow, this is not to say that the courts might not loo!;
17
18

to the common law, but at that time Swift against Tyson was
in effect and it was assumed to be a unifora Federal common

19
law, so 1 think Swift against Tyson had some effect on the
20
Court.

Of course, that’s been laid to rest in 1936 and 1938»

21

But, in looking to the common law, if a court in
22

j

Admiralty were going to apply maritime law, were going to look
23
tothe common law, it seems to

irs

the court would look and find

24
adoption of the common law, which was a progressive, good
25

in

1

adoption and everyone said this is wonderful and is something

2

that should be adopted by the Admiralty.
"

But in this case, the Court adopted a rule of the

3
4

common law which had been abrogated four years before by the

5

English Parliament, which had been criticised by everybody

6

that had ever said anything about it, which everybody agreed

7

was a terrible rule of the common law and which everybody

,8

agrees today is a terrible rule.-.-

9

So, Admiralty went out from the civil law here, to

10

engraft into Maritime Law a rule of the Common Law which no­

II

body defends.

tz

for wrongful death? that's in the statute.

That is* that is there is no right of action

13

And this is where --

So that the Harrisburg now has resulted by evolution
11

1

in the situation that we find ourselves now in Moragne and

2

that iss where the State of Florida has effectively abolished

3

the warranty of seaworthiness which is deeply engrafted in

4

admiralty and maritime law.

So that a longshoreman who is

3

killed as distinguished from being injured, on navigable

6

waters of the State of Florida, navigable waters of the United

7

States, within the State of Florida, is deprived of this

a

doctrine, this warranty of seaworthiness; and is relegated to

9

‘10

common law negligence, which is

13

I think that it has been traditional that Admiralty
courts, the Supreme Court in particular, has fashioned
admiralty remedies and admiralty law where necessary.
I need to only point out a few.

14
15
16
1?

18

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

very different type"animal

from the negligei.ce that we note in maritimi© law.

11
12

L

For instance, in

this case, the shipowner seeking indemnity against the
stevedore.

An indemnity of a shipowner against the stevedore

was fashioned by the Court in the Ryan case on such an
occasion.
We have indemnity involved in this case; in this
very case, which is a Court-made or Court“fashioned maritime
doctrine, which is unknow* in the State of Florida but it9s
going to be an issue in this case, and yet the respondents
say that the plaintiff, the petitioner here should be rele­
gated to state law as far as her rights for death are con­
cerned, securing on navigable waters, but they turn around and
12

1

seek the benefit of the Court-fashioned right of indemnity

a

against the stevedore.

3

Of course, the duty of — the warranty of seaworthi­

4

ness is a thing that has been fashioned by the Court, and the

5

impleader rules have been fashioned by the Court.

6

X8d like to point out one other thing.

7

1917 and 1924, starting with the Jensen case, the Supreme

8

Court held that a state law, workmen's compensation law could

9

not validly be applied'to maritime injuries or death occuring

to

Back in

on state waters.
After the Jense case, the Congress passed a statute

1!
12

which had the effect of placing state workmen's compensation

13'

laws over these injuries and deaths.

14

Knickerbocker case said "you can't do that; that’s uncors-

15

stiutional."

And the Court in the

So then the Congress came back and passed another

36
17

statute of the same type exempting members — masters and

18

members of the crew of vessels.

19

"You cannot constitutionally apply a state statue, workmen's

20

compensation statute to injuries or death occuring on maritime

2!

waters.”

22

And the Court again said:

It seems to me in the Tungus that this Court has

23

done in maritime deaths, what the Court three times said back

24

in 1917 and 1924 that the Tungus could not constitutionally do.

25

So, I urge this Court, and I'd like to reserve ray
13

!

1

remaining time for rebuttal, if I may.

2
3

But, I would urge this Court to receive from the
majority ruling in Tungus and to overrule the Harrisburg.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY LOUIS F. CLAIBOURNE f

MR. CLAXBOURNE:

Thank you, Mr. Hardee.

Mr. Chief Justice, and maw it please

to the Courts invitation to file a brief and to participate in

%z

the oral argument of the case.

13

The United States is here- in this case, pursuant

W® have devoted our submission primarily to' the pro­

14

position that the Harrisburg, in answer to the Court’s

15

question, ought fcobe overruled.

16

Incidentally, we see no difficulty in that being

1?

done in a diversity case, it being clear, I think, that a

18

state court may apply admiralty law and the Federal Court to

19

which such a cause is removed under the diversity jurisdiction

20

may likewise do so. although the case could not have been

21

brought on the law side of the Federal Court originally,
t

22
23
24
25

absent the diversity of citizenship.
Q

And this is removed on diversity and what

happens to Erie Railroad against Tompkins?
A

Well, I thought, Mr. Justice Stewart, this
14

- I

Court had long settled that under the

2

state courts or Federal courts acting as state courts, that is

3

under their diversity jurisdiction, applied Federal Maritime

4

Lav/ in all maritime cases.

At the election of the plaintiff—

Well, what about — the plaintiff here elected

6

to proceed under two state statutes: a Wrongful Death Statute

1

and a Survivor8s Statute»

a

quite unlike the plaintiff in the Tungus case.
A

9

He didn’t through an admiralty?

Mr. Justice Stewart, there may be a problem

10

of pleading? there’s no problem of jurisdiction.

tl

here, just as Mr. Justice Burger said a moment ago, if this

12

had been a personal injury case, the claim could have been

13

under the warranty of seaworthiness, a Federal claim,'and

14

it Could have been vindicated in the state court or inthe

Q.

A

18

Q

Without question?
tod it would be no different
There is another answer here anyway.

This

19

whole thing arises because Count 2, which is framed on un-

20

seaworthiness , was dismissed by the District Court and. that

21

dismissal was sustained in the Court of Appeals and that all

22

was founded on unseaworthiness? wasn’t it?

23

case.

24

as

A

A Federal question

Except to the extent, Mr. Justice, that the

claim was unseaworthiness as recognized by the State Wrongful
15

I

Death Standard.

2

suit is brought simply alleging a. claim for wrongful death and

3

unseaworthiness without particularly or ■uniquely invoking the

4

State Wrongful Death Act.

S

6
1

&
B

Q

However,as I reafi the complaint, it's -- the

The exact statute.

Count 2 doesn’t uniquely

invoke the State Wrongful Death Act.
A

Nor does Count 4, which is also an unseaworthi­

ness count for the longshoremen’s own injury.
Q

Mr. Claiborne, had the suit been, as you

10

suggested, for an injury and not for death, what would have

11

been the source, the basis for the suit?

12

A

\

I would have been a Federal Maritime Law of

13

unseaworthiness as to Count II of the complaint, which is the

U

only one here at issue, which is enforceable in both the State

15

Courts and in *— on the law side of a FEderal Court on a

16

diversity head of jurisdiction, as well as an admiralty without

17

a jury, v?ithout diversity.

18
■19
.20

21

22
23
24
25

Q

And were there no statutes at all, would there

have been a right to sue for the injury?

A

There is no statute whatever that would have

been a right to sue for the injury.
Q

Well, is that a distinction?

I'm not suggesting

that it's a significant one, but that is a distinction between
the death act and the action for injuries? isn't it?

A

WE1X, our suggestion here, Mr. Justice, is that

16

1
2

3
4

S
6
7
8
9
10

once the Harrisburg is overruled, as we submit to the Court it
should be, there will likewise be a right to sue for wrongful
death without a statute, without invoking the State Wrongful
Death Statute»
And so, in that sense, this is exactly the same case
as it would be for a personal injury in the right court*
Q

Well, if the law is different from what if is

today, then your rates would be different; that’s what you're
really saying?
A
q

That is what I'm saying*
That wouldn’t get us very far.

11

A

But there, is no jurisdictional problem, there

12

may be a question as to the efficiency of the pleading, though
13
I don’t think there is any problem with the sufficiency of the
14
complaint.

There may be some question as to the plaintiff’s

15
agreeing that the matter ought to be determined at the proper
16
time by reference to Florid® law, when

the certification

17
to the Florida Supreme Court was made.
18
However, it really is not my place to speak to any
19

defect in the way the plaintiff brought suit here.

We assume

20
that the question is before the Court and answer it as the
21

Court — or requested thafcwe do.

22
The faults of the. problems created by the decision
23
in the Harrisburg have been sufficiently exposed.

The under­

24.
lying principles, both the common lav? rule denying recovering

17

scholars that I need hardly add anything to what they have

4

said» mentioning only that they inelude Mr, Justice Holmes,

5

Judge Learned Hand, Dean Fassa and Bean Pound,

6

Congress, in one sense, has also repudiated the

7

result which the Harrisburg required by enacting Federal

8

statutes which, to a large extent supplant the state laws,

9

notably: the Death on the High Seas Act, though it starts at

10

the three-mile line and the Jones Act, which covers all

11

maritime waters, but only with respect to true seamen,

12

.The Harrisburg is today, whatever the correctness of

H3

decision at the time there was some reason to question that,

14

is today an anachronism.

15

which are not mere anomalies, they are arbitrary results,

16

often unjust and very much at odds with the desirable

17

uniformity of the admiralty laws.

It creates a series of anomalies

Just talcing —

Q

21

Did Congress order that situation since the

Harrisburg was decided?

A

No question whatever, Mr. Justice, that

Congress could and as the other side will, I am sure, point

23

out, there is pending a bill which would have some such result,:

although I must.

7

will try to explain in a moment, did not choose to —

So we really

And yet the submission in this case would be

that those people would have a greater right of action for

to

wrongful death, their representatives, for the wrongful death

1?

of those people than they would if they were shore, if it had

12

happened on the shore, on the land in Florida, which gives the

13

right of wrongful death only for negligence, I

14

A

Yes. Well, putting it the other way, Mr.

15

Justice, we would say they should not have less rights simply

16

because the accident occurred beyond the three-mile limit,

17
18

nor should they have —
\*
Q
Well, Congress passed a statute for people

19

beyond the three-mile limit.

20

A

I'll come to that, Mr. Justice.

Let me say

21

that the anomalies created are really three; the same conduct

22

which imposes liability on shipowners produces one result if

23

the man, if the victim is injured and it produces often a

24

different result if the man is killed, and there is no rhyme or

25

reason to that. . .
19

1

Likewise, the same conduct by the shipowner —

2

Q

That5s true, of course, in — there’s nothing

3

unusual about that.

4

limited liability for wrongful death —

5

A

Many states, for example, that have

Mr. Justice, there is no state law which

8

provides no remedy when the man is killed, while providing a

1

remedy for the same conduct when the man is merely injured -

There may be degrees ~

Q

This isn’t a case where no remedy is provided.

There is a remedy here for negligence.
A

The same conduct which, in this case, for this

purpose, is unseaworthiness of the vessel.

There is no remedy

under Florida lav/ when the seaman dies -— when the longshoreman
dies, whereas it affords a remedy, as it must under' Federal
law when the longshoreman is injured.
So, it’s an all-or-nothing proposition.
Now, likewise, the same conduct may give rise to an
obligation to pay or a right of ree-,very, depending on whether
it happens within or outside the three -mile limit, a line
which makes no sense in terms of maritime jurisdiction. which
covers the entire area.
Q

When you say it makes no sense, you are saying

that the line-dr awing^ by Congress did not have a logical,
sensible basis? isn’t that what you're saying?
A

Wo.

1 think it, as I will suggest it, did have

some basis.

law then existing have now become acute and arbitary, though

I don't impute any such purpose to the Congress in 1930 when

Beyond that, there was a confused situation. Some
thought a vacuum and at least an appropriate place to, an

the state remedy provided by the Wrongful Death Act.

Indeed, the suggestion is that the state law was

more generous than the new Federal Law and. some complaining

The strangest of all the anomalies produced by the

Q

How is that?

A

Under this Court's decision in Lindgren and in

2

to the State Wrongful Death Act, even where that State Wrong­

3

The Jones Act.

5

A

They could apply to the Jones Act remedy for

have been available to a seaman.

8

Q

He wasn't a seaman in the Tungus —

9

A

Ho , but the seaman would not have had the

10

benefit of the ruling in the Tungus , given the facts of the

11

Hew Jersey Law, did provide that remedy.
Q

12
13

So, the Jones Act, insofar as it’s been

equated with FELA still uses the word "negligence."
A

14

I’m assuming there is a difference, and infchis

case -— the assumption is that there is a difference between

16

unseaworthiness and negligence.

17
18

Though, I recognize that

negligence under the Jones Act is a broader concept, than
negligence under Florida’s law.
But there has to be a reason for not setting things

time has passed and it’s too late, that this Court has made a

That is the second argument against repealing

There was ~ there were statements in the decision,
the majority decision, in the Tungus to the effect that
Congress drew a knowing line between the three-miles and beyond
the three miles that it explicitly or clearly intended to
.preserve state remedies within the three-mile area.
Having looked at the legislative history, we notice
first that the Committee Reports say no such thing.

simply notice the result that state laws will remain available

25

laws normally didn’t mean to govern accident on the high seas,
and there was a vacuum, there, which Congress, quite reasonably
thought it necessary to fill.
24

1

As I have also suggested there were those who wanted

z

to preserve state remedies within the three-mile area because

3

they were familiar with them, or because they viewed them as

4

more generous than the pending Federal legislation.

5

Those are hardly reasons for this Court today to

6

hesitate to erase that distinction, a distinction which then

7

was not as great as it is now, because then unseaworthiness

&

remedies were unknown for practical purposes and the remedy

9

beyond three miles was no greater than what the State Wrongful

this action for wrongful deaths who can sue, statute of

16

A

Basically yes, Mr. Justice, but I must point

out that overruling the Harrisburg is not fashioning a whole

are concerned with in this case is the balancing of competing

17

18

the territorial limits of a state and the question has got to

19

be in the end? which of the two interests, Federal or State

20

have more urgent or the more Important right to control this

21

sort of death.

22

The shipowner, States Marine Lines, asks the Court

The law today, we think, is clear on the principles

23

that have been with us since the Harrisburg and right on up

24

through Gillespie in 1964 on the Federal side; principles that

25

have been known and used in Florida in this specific context
2»

1

since 1953 and as recently as 1968 in this very case, and in

z

which Congress and the Florida Legislature have acquiesced

3

regularly.

4

We think that to overturn a foody of law that has

5

been developed in this way and to say to the Justices of this

6

Court -who have fashioned this body of law and the Congress and

7

the Legislature who have also contributed to it, did this

8

unthinkingly or without realizing what they were doing is just

9

to ask too much of you.

10

The result,, limited to the area in which this action

n

occurred is that a nonseaman, like Moragne, the result of the

12

Florida Supreme Court5s construction of the Florida statute

13

is-that Moragne, the longshoreman has exactly the same right

14

that a seaman or the seaman’s widow would have had had a

15

seaman been standing right by him and been hit by the same

16

hatch beam,,.

17

That is uniformity.

No matter which way you turn in this case and in this

18

area, there is going to be some nonuniformity for somebody,

19

and the survivors of Mr, Moragne here, have already, as has

20

been mentioned, they have a compensation remedy and they have

a negligence remedy,

Ivould submit to the Court that the distinction

Uniformity has often been urged in this area on this

that wrongful death is an area which does not require the:

A

Yes, as a crew member, an employee —

10

Q

Because of the language in the Jones Act.

11

A

We think that the reason that this law has

12

developed in this way results from a consideration of the

'

13

desirability of having local uniformity for people who are

14

essentially local, like longshoremen.

15

And the thought by the Court and Congress and the

16

Legislature 'that people like longshoremen, like this plain­

17

tiff's decedent, who lived in Tampa and worked in Tampa

18

every day, should be more like the remedies accorded•to - his

for uniformity of a man who, on a ship, comes into Tampa today

seems no reason in policy as far as Florida is concerned, to

prefer the widow of a longshoreman over the widow of another

man because of the fortuitous circumstances that her husband

9

met his death in the hold of a ship and not on the dock or

10

not in the mill or not in the mine.

11

I 'think the Solicitor General and Mr. Hardee have

12

said, "Well, ail you’ve got to do to straighten this out is

13

simply to create a common-law remedy for maritime purposes,

14.

anyway, that says you can have an action for wrongful death."

15
16
17

Well, the ohher way of saying that is that all f&aav€
got to do to straighten this out is, in effect, repeal the
Death on the High Seas Act, which very definitely says"to the

18

three-mile limit -and no further," would this Federally-created

19

right come.

And in doing that, X might say, speaking of

ORAL ARGUMENT BY' DAVID C. 6/KERR, ESC?..

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT GULF FLORIDA

TERMINAL CORPORATION
MR. KERR;

6

to

Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

I'sn representing the Respondent stevedore, Gulf

Florida Terminal Corporation that was
owner, by virtue of the

impleaded by the ship

Ryan doctrine, which has been re­

ferred to by Mr. Hardee.
And before proceeding with the two or three points
that Isd like to cover, I might mention, parenthetically,
that Mr. Hardee indicated that the Ryan Doctrine was one newly
fashioned in admiralty.

And ' ; I remember that decision

correctly, and it,Js not directly involved in the appeal here,
15

16

it was merely an extension of implied contractual warranties
which had been recognized as early as Buick versus McPherson

i?

m
19

and then restated in the restatement of contracts and those
were the authorities relied on by the Court.
In any event, at this stage of litigation, at least

20
21
22

the interest of the shipowner and stevedore are alive and we
join, therefore, in urging that the Court of Appeals below,
and insofar as they incorporated the opinion in the Florida

23
Supreme Court, that court also be affirmed by this Court.

24
I*d like tomake just three points.

25
37

The first one is

i

1

one that I think is demonstrated by the Florida Supreme Court

z

in its opinion asone of the ethical factors that it had in

3

mind in trying to arrive at a decision, and that was the pos­

■4

ture of the case as it presented itself to that court.

5

In the first place * the court recognized that Mrs.

6

Moragne, the Petitioner her, had available one remedy, irre­

7

spective of fault, already, and they took note of the fact

8

that she had available to her the statutory remedies under the

9

Federal Longshore, Harbor Workers” Compensation Act.

10

They also recognised that she would have, in addi­

31

tion to that right, the right topursue a course of action

12

based on negligence on the Florida Wrongful Death Statute.

13
14

So that the sole issue, really, the sole practical
issue was whether or not she would also, in addition to those

15

two, pursue a course of action based on a warranty of sea­

16

worthiness, which stated somewhat differently what was already

17

alluded to by Mr. Villareal.

18

as to what burden of proof she will have to maintain in the

19

trial court.

20
21

It simply boils down to the fact

At this stage, then, the oft-repeated cry, which is
found in the briefs of the Petitioner and some of the amicus

22

briefs, also, to the effect that: "It ib'cheaper to kill-'than to

23

injure," is at least premature.

24
25

Indeed, should negligence be

established under the Florida Wrongful Death Statute it could
very possibly ha that she would receive as much in compensatiorL
38

1

if not more than some other defendants similarly situated .

2

while land-based or land-locked,,
The second point whichJL think was paramount in the

3

/

4

minds of the Fifth Circuit when they considered this problem

5

was that in fungus the decision and the majority opinion is

6

quite clear and was followed by the parties all the way up to

7

the Fifth Circuit and was followed by the Fifth Circuit in

8

adopting the decision of the Florida Supreme Court.
Because, in fungus, there are at least four points

0
10

which become eminently clear and which are stated without any

it

equivocation by Mr. Justice Stewart-.
The first is that: "The State ..Wrongful Death

12
13

Statutes do not merely give rise to a right to recover, but

14

further establish what type of conduct-is actionable."1

15

The second, proposition which is stated with equ«I

18

clarity; "When admiralty courts are called upon to apply on

17

forced rights which are frooted,* in state law, then they, the

18

admiralty courts must do so, consonant with state substantive

19

law.

20

choose."

21

22
23

24
25

They may not,,” as the decision went on to say, "pick or

The third principle, which is eminently clear in
thatopinion is that; "Congress, in enacting the Death on the
High Seas'Act, intended to preserve, intact, state sovereignty
over maritime deaths within territorial waters.
And a fourth proposition which is stated in the
39

1

opinion is that: "The uniformity argument is inapplicable in

2

the case of rights given to recover in death cases."

3

has already been suggested — this was noted as early as

4

the Jensen case, both in the majority opinion and in ir.

S

Justice Holmes°s opinion where he spoke of the "specter of a

And it

t

§

lack of uniformity"in referring to this particular, area of the

1

law.
This latter proposition in Tugguss, we submit, is

8
9
10
II
12

13

probably or undoubtedly the key question-.

that in this particular area of the law, with respect to the
death cases, there should be a departure from so-called
uniformity and there has been consistently in this Court and
other courts,,
We submit that the Harrisburg and Jensen and Tungr

14
15

That is: why is it

and also, ard particularly, actually, language in Mr. jtr-’-ce
Harlan's dissont in Hess, suggests several reasons wh

an this

18
particular are." of the law uniformity has not bee7' a compelling

17
'18

factor.
In the first place, actions for wrongful deatn being

19
preachers of statute, are inherently nonuniform in every

20
jurisdiction and it's not veryhelpiul here to point out 'chat

21
the archaic and inhumane treatme; t given this matter under

22
common law, is no longer fashionable.

This, of course, Is

23
true, but the simple fact is that every jurisdiction has its

24
own statutory scheme.

Indeed, Congress has two separate

25
40

statutory schemes and they are themselves, dissimilar.

1

Perhaps uniformity or lack of uniformity, for this

2

reason, is a built-in situation.

3

Secondly, as has been pointed out, the Wrongful’

4

Death Statutes involve matters which are peculiarly of local
S

concern, and again from the Hess opinion, cites such examples

7

as: pauperism and dissent and distribution and other matters

S

which are really almost within the state5® police power.
The third reason why this area has perhaps been

©
!0

carved out of the uniformity situation: while the Wrongful

1?

Death Statute may be of grave concern in individual cases to

32

certain individuals, they do not, from a maritime concept,
involve matters of navigation and commerce.

13

In reading the cases, one notices, particularly in
Hess and also in Jensen that the concept of uniformity in

15

admiralty was developed more as a maritime commercial aid»

W

That is,, to give a shipowner some degree of certainty as to

17

whatT'Sis obligations would be, commercial and from the stand­

38

point of 'commercial obligations and navigational requirements

19

and regulations, from state to state and nation to nation.

29

It was to give him some certainty, indeed, I think thisis

21

perhaps an explanation of the ’less case, where the Oregon

22

statute in question increased or imposed an added burden.

23

It

was this type of uniformity from the standpoint of the ship-

24

owner's operation that the concept, we suggest, or we submit,

In

The final point that I would like to make in this

17
13

connection is that the statutory history of the Florida

19

Wrongful Death Statute was of some concern of the Florida

20

Court.

21

this is consonant with the attitude which has been demon­

22

strated by this Court and its concern with the history of

23

Death on the High Seas Act and the Jones Act.

24
25

It was discussed at some length in the opinion and

We rate# for instance# that the Death on the High
Seas Act was passed 34 years after the Harrisburg had

42

s

established that there was no action for wrongful death in

2

maritime law for fatality within the territorial waters of the

3

state»

4

to preserve state, sovereignty in this area»

3

6
' 7

B

And, as has been demonstrated by this Court, an intent

There have been no amendments to the Death on the
High Seas Act until the recently-proposed Magnusson Bill, which
is Senate Bill 3143 and is mentioned in the briefs»
Despite the decision in Tungus in 1959 and Hess and

©

Goette in I960, similarly, with respect to the -Jones Act,;

10

there has been no.amendment to cover death of a seaman in

-I!

state territorial waters, based on unseaworthiness as a cause

IE

of action, despite the decision inLittdgren which was in' 1930,

‘13

and the reaffirmation of that principle in Gillespie in 1964»

14
13
16

17
15

So,'this'Court has taken note of Congress’s'
inactivity or, if you will, acquiescence.
The Florida Supreme Court, was faced with a very

•,

similar situation because in Graham v. Lusi, which was decided
in 1953 it was held that the Florida g&atjutes did not contem­

19

plate a cause of action based on unseaworthiness, and that was

29

reaffirmed in Emerson v. Holloway in I960.

21

So, there were 15 years without, corrective action by

22

the Florida Legislature and yet as noted by the Florida

23

Supreme Court, the Florida Legislature has been sensitive to

24

this statute, because it did amend the statute to cover cause

25

of action based on a warranty on foodstuffs, at cetera.

43

i

And they did that very promptly, because the decision which

z

held that it was not covered under the statute was in 1952 and

3

the very next session adopted an amendment to the Florida

4

Wrongful Death Statute.
They havenot chosen to do so, despite the opinions

5
6

of the Fifth Circuit which have been in existence for sane

7

time.

8
9

We attach some significance to the sensitivity which
has been demonstrated by this Court*, as well as the sensi­

10

tivities demonstrated by the Florida Supreme Court to existing1

11

statutes and existing statutory schemes.

12

We feel it highlights the fact that if a change in

13

this particular area of the law is to come, it must come

14

through the legislature and not through the Court.

IS

Q

Well, what the Florida Legislature has done or

16

has not done, doesn't really bear at all upon the fundamental

n

issue here? dees it?

18

A

No, sir? I don't believe it does.

19

Q

What Congress has done or has not done, indeed,

20
21

toss have a great deal of relevance.
A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

I was-merely emphasizing

22

the Florida Supreme Court was also sensitive to a statutory

23

history which it had and this Court has demonstrated, I be­

24

lieve that same sensitivity.

And a passenger doesn’t have a right to

recover for unseaworthiness wherever he is..
A

That’s right, because the warranty

doesn’t

apply to — doesn’t extend to apply to Si passenger, unless
it clearly was negligent in furnishing a seaworth vessel.
Q

That's negligence? not unseaworthiness.

A

But, a longshoreman may recover in

all the

States except Florida, will decide the question, both for
negligence and unseaworthiness in the territorial waters of the
United States.
So that a seaman, for whom -the doctrine of unsea­

22

worthiness was originally fashioned in the Osceola, has a
'less right by reason of the preemption problem that confronted
the Court in Lindgren and Gillespie, than longshoremen had.

Why?
Because he does not have — the warranty of

seaworthiness does not extend to him in a death case within the

territorial waters of the United States.

the longshoremen can take
