S

ORAL ARGUMENT BY LEONARD B. BOUDIN, ESQ.

S

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. BOUDIN:

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

8

the Court:

9

of the Ohio Supreme Court, denying the Petitioner the right to

10

take the bar examination there, which is a condition to admis­

11

sion to the Bar.

This is a petition seeking review from an order

12

The Petitioner was denied that right because of

13

his refusal to answer three questions? a refusal based upon

14

both First Amendment and Fifth Amendment grounds.

15

questions appear at the bottom of Page, 5 and the top of Page

16

S of the Petitioner’s brief.

17

Those

Question 12(g): "State whether you have been, or

18

presently are, a member of any organization which advocates the

19

overthrown of the Government of the United States by force.

20

your answer to any section of the above question is !yess set

21

forth the facts in detail.”

22

Question 13:

(These are on two questionnaires) sayn

23

"List the names and addresses of all clubs, societies or

24.

organizations of which you are or have been a member."

25

If

And Question 7, at the top of Page 6, asks: "List

2

1

the names and addresses of all the clubs, societies or

2

organizations of which you are or have been a member since

3

registering as a law studento"
I should Sciy that the Petitioner had been admitted

4

/

5

to the New York Bar? was then in Ohio working for a branch of

6

the Office of Economic Opportunity and applied for admission

7

to the Ohio Bar.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

8
9
10

Well, what he applied for was

permission to take the examination for the Ohio Bar? isn5t
that correct?

11

MR. BOUDIN:

Precisely.

12

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

If he had been a member of the

13

Ohio Bar for a certain numberof years, he could have been ad­

14

mitted on motion, I think.
MR. BOUDIN: No.

15

Is that still true?
When he appeared, before — when

16

he got these questions he declined to answer all those ques­

17

tions on the application form, on the ground of what he said

18

was the Fifth Amendments and all of us have assumed that that

19

meant at that stage the privilege against self-incrimination.

20

Subsequently, in meetings with the Character Com­

21

mittee Members, he indicated that he was also relying upon the

22

First Amendment and that.he regarded the questions that were

23

put as not pertinent to his gpalifications as a member of the

24

Bar.

25

And when the Character Committee, or the members of the

committee, eventually wrote their report, they praised very
3

1

strongly the impression that this young man had made on them

2

in their interrogation and one of them said that if the rest

3

of the committee would not mind the fact that he hadn't

4

answered these questions, I would have recommended his admis­

5

sion» -But the committee decided not to recommend his admis­

8

sion -- that is, his admission to the examination.
And at that stage while the matter was appearing,

7
8

was before the Ohio Supreme Court, he retained counsel.

And

9

counsel wrote to the Ohio Supreme Court, pointing out that the

10

Petitioner has raised First and Fifth Amendment grounds and

it

that a recent decision of Judge Friendly, in what we call the

12

LSCRRC case, the Law Students Civil Rights Council case, now

13

pending in this Court at 696.

14

In a recent decision by a statutory court, headed

IS

by Judge Friendly, questions of this very type were found by

w

the statutory court to be improper and to imping® upon First

17

Amendment rights.

18

which Judge Friendly found questions of this kind to be

19

improper»

And I will develop shortly the respects in

And Counsel suggested the desirability of appearing

20
21

before the Ohio Supreme Court to argue the matter? instead the

22

Supreme Court upheld the Committee and entered an order,

23

appearing at Page 56-A of the appendix, denying the application

24

of Mr. Stolar to appear before the Bar —■ to take the examina­

25

tion.

4

Now, we, as I indicated before;, I airs reasonably

1

2

satisfied, to the extent that counsel ®n ever be, could pre­

3

vail in this Court on the grounds indicated by Judge Friendly

4

in the 1SC3RC -case.

5

myself specifically to the questions put by Ohio to Mr. Stolar.

And I will turn those when I address

8

We think, however, that there are more important

7

problems — more fundamental problems, relating to the entire

8

question of political qualifications, if I may use that term

9

for the momentP to admission to the bar and it is for that

IQ

reason that our first point in our submission is that political

11

beliefs and political associations and political advocacy of

12

any kind, are not proper conditions or grounds for disqualifica­

13

tion to the admission of the practice of law.
As I say, 1 realize the burden tlat I am faced

14
15

with in presenting that proposition inlight of several cases

16

in the Court for the assumption underlying those cases.

17

But 1

want to address myself to that before I begin my argument on the

18

second and third points, which are that the tests and the

19

questions and the procedures followed by Ohio, in this par­

2.0

21

22
23

24
25

ticular case, violate the rule with precision which has been
set down by this Court in a large series of cases in the., last
five or ten years, where First Amendment rights may be impinged
upon.
And my third argument is going to be very brief and
that will relate to the right to assert a privilege against
5

1

self-incrimination in answers to questions put by a character

2

committee.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

3
4

two propositions together in any way —
MR. BOUDIN;

5
S

Well, do you link those

I think these are completely inde­

pendent, Your Honor; the last two.

7

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; The last two.

8

MR. BOUDIN; The last two are completely independent,

9

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You’re not suggesting

10

the assertion of the privilege against the question directed

11

to the inquiry about the Communist Party?
MR. BOUDIN;

12

I am suggesting that, too, and I will

13

come to that as the last phase? but I am suggesting the right

14

to assert the privilege there.
.

r*

.

"*

18

I want to suggest very briefly that we have
♦
elaborated m our brief and it will require, we hope, a recon­

17

sideration by the Court of some re as s ump t i on s in Konigsberg

IS

and Anastaplo, despite the fact that they are factually dis­

19

tinguished by the element of'the question of Communist Party

20

membership, whiclr, for one reason or another, have been regarded,

21

as sui generis in this court.

15

22

I want to take the first proposition, which is that

23

it seems to us that a political test, and I may suggest even

23

of conduct which is unlawful, although obviously, we don5t hav,e

23

to go that far here, is not related to the proper functions of

6

1

a

the bar.
Mow, yesterday it was suggested by soma members of

3

the Court that the fact that some political activities might

4

be protected against criminal prosecution — Mr. Justice

5

Stewart, I think, made the point -- citing when Brandenburg

8

against Ohio was mentioned, does not necessarily mean that the

7

persons engaging

3

prosecution are proper for admission to the bar.

3

-those activities protected against criminal

And 1 wish to suggest that a reading of Keyishian

10

and of Elfbrandt and Rebel and Schneider and Smith, which we

11

have cited and quoted from in our brief, suggests the contrary;

12

that those cases emphasise the point and in dealing with what

13

we think, with all due respect, as least as sensitive and more

14

sensitive occupations than membership in the bar, namely,

13

work in a defense plant, work as a teacher with the young, work

16

in the Merchant Marin©? and in all of those cases the Court has

17

said that these are constitutionally-protected activities and '

m

that constitutionally-protected activities cannot be a ground

19

for disqualification from employment.

20

Now, our submission here, and I don't think it has

21

been fully argued, obviously, on this argument, 1 can't argue

22

it fully, either, is that the profession of the law is a pro­

23

fession where these standards are less applicable, for the

24

following reasons:

25

First, it is, of course, not an employee of the
7

i

state,' and whatever powers the state has over the employees

z

should not be applied to the laywer , and we think, to the

3

aspirant lawyer.

4
3

The second is it is very difficult to conceive of
there
precisely what function/is as a lawyer that would be adversely

6

affected by a political viewpoint, or to #o further, political

7

activity, seems to us that, there is a difference between the

S

question of a good private character, to go back to the ex

9

parte Garland phrase, which we quote in our brief, and the

10

question of a public character, which is involved in questions
v

«I

of conception of whether or not the state should be overthrown

12

by force and violence to take the extreme situation.

13

Always the history of life in this country, and in

14

the- world generally, has shown that the most honorable persons

15

have had conceptions and have sometimes attempted to carry out

16

those conceptions into actions inthe political field, without,
V

c

17

in the slightest way reflecting upon their good character,

18

except when they have failed, I suppose.

19

being any suggestion of the question of moral integrity.

20

think back, specifically,.'to the case of ex parte Garland,

21

where it is true, the Court based its decision on the rubric —

22

on a principle of a bill of attainder and ex post facto law?

23

and yet in that case and in Cummings against Ohio, we were

24

dealing with the most serious of political crimes; we were

25

dealing with matters described by -- I think it was Mr. Justice

8

And without there
And I

\

Miller in his dissent, as treasonable activities by Mr.

2

Garland, who after engaging in the fight against the Union on

3

behalf of the Confederacy, was admitted to the bar here, or

4

retained his membership in the bar, I should say, and eventually

3

became Attorney General of the United States.

6

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

Would you think it were at all

7

permissible for a committee to ask an applicant if he ad­

8

vocated assassination to right social wrongs?
MR. BOUDIN;

9

I think when we get to an extreme

10

question of assassination, Your Honor, it's always one of those

n

extreme problems that are very hard to answer.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE;

12

Well, then, make it more

13

general.

Do you advocate the general use of violence, violent

14

means to achieve social and economic ends.
MR. BOUDIN;

15
1®

17

with the point of view I suggested,,, the committee could not ask
that kind of question.
MR. JUSTICE' WHITE;'

18
‘19

22

That is is wholly irrelevant

to the —

(
■r

MR. BOUDIN;

20
21

I think my answer would be consistent

I think it is irrelevant to the prac-v

tice of law.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE;

You mean the advocacy of

23

violence — 1 suppose you would say, then, that it would be

24

wrong to ask a person: Are you not*? engaged in violent activities

25

to right social wrongs?

9

1

MR. BOUDIN: I would consider that* too -- Of course,

2

we are really dealing here at the moment, with three kinds of

3

things; belief, association and advocacy and --

4

MR. JUSTICE WHITE;

5

How about the last -— my last

question„

$

MR. BOUDIN:

7

I would even feel that as far as

conduct were concerned, that would be an improper question.

8

MR. JUSTICE WHITE;

9

And certainly, a fortiorari

this advocacy ©f violence.

10

MR. BOUDIN;

11

How, I would say that there is — in other words,

12

I would not base as matters which may reflect upon —- matters

13

which should be handled where we reach the point of danger to

14

the community, handled in the ordinary manner of due process by

15

trial.

IS

of the lawyer as a lawyer in the process.

17

very different situation from the policeman who*is given a gun.

That is quite right, Your Honor.

I don’t regard those as bearing upon the functioning
I think this is a

a

18

This is the question put, yesterday, I think, also, and whom

19

one would expect, because he is given a gun, to have respon­

20

sibility with respect tothe use of it.
But I think that there must be a distinction between

21

22

the function of the lawyer in his private capacity and the

23

lawyer and his function as a lawyer.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE;

24

Well, a lawyer then — there is

nothing inconsistent with being a lawyer and advocating the

25

10
f

1

breaking of the law; even lav/s against violence?

2

MR, BOUDIN:

Well, the difficulty is — I'm going

3

to answer your question directly, I hope, but the difficulty

4

is, Mr, Justice, that we really are not dealing in reality in

5

this field if we analyse fcha last 20 years, with the questions

6

of anarchism or questions of actual

7

dealing --

3

9

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

iolence.

We are really

Well, I'm not trying to deal

with politics, but with questions about violence,

10

MR. BOUDIN:

I would say that even questions with

11

respaet to violence, when one is talking about advocacy of

12

yioXcnqe —> l5m not talking about conduct yet.

13

think, if it reaches a point where it is punishable; where it

14

is outside the First amendment protection, and most conduct is,

15

of course —

16

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

So, lawyers

Conduct, I

applicants

17

should be admitted even though they say they would advise

13

clients to break laws

19

MR. BOUDIN:

Now we are coming to the question of

20

what a lawyer would advise a client.

21

into a different area.

22

and as I was about to say — it's very hard if I say to hit

23

the extreme situation —■ I think we have to recognise that

24

what we are dealing with here, we are dealing with this whole

25

question of membership in organisations having political

I think we are moving

I was dealing with the law as a citizen

11

1

philosophy,, because that’s what these questions are dealing

2

with»

We really aren't dealing with the extreme situation,
MR, JUSTICE WHITE:

3

What if they overlap?

I mean,

4

where part of a political philosophy might be to use violent

3

means and. break the laws against violence to achieve what

6

might be called, political ends?
MR. BOUDIN:

7

I think it is a closer question when

e

we get to the overlapping end of the conduct, but I really

9

think that all of these questions, Your Honor, if we are talk­

10

ing within the framework of reality, are questions that are

n
n

conerned with membership of organizations which have particular
political points of view.

13

the question — nobody ever asks: "Did you engage in violence,"

14

the kind of question put by Your Honor, but all we are dealing

13

16
17

We are really never coming down to

with is: "Are you a member of an organization which has for
its purpose, which has the literature behind it, advocating
the overthrow of che government by force and violence?"
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

18

Your arguments have not reached

V-

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

• my question.
MR. BOUDIN;

My question is a difficult one when I

get down to the question of actual conduct,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Didn't I get the impres­

sion, Mr. Boudin, that you thought some of these types of
questions might be appropriate to ask a candidate for the police
force but inappropriate for the lawyer?
12

1

MR, BOUDIN:

Yes, I did think so, Your Honor,

2

because I thought that he had a particular responsibility and

3

a particular danger and it was his job to enforce the law»

4

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Then it would seem to

5

follow that you place the policeman's responsibility on a highei:

6

or lower plane?

7

MR. BOUDIN:

No; just different.

That is; the

8

policeman, has the duty of law enforcement and I consider the

9

lawyer, as a matter o£ fact, very often a bulwark between his

10

clients and the government, in reality.

11

my giving Your Honor the history of the thing.

\z

difference of function; not one that's higher or lower.

13

i

-

There is no point in
I think it's a

But I would like, because I recognize the difficulty

14

of part of this argument when we move to the point suggested by

15

Mr. Justice White, pertaining to the particular questions here,

16

because the questions here, I think, clearly fall under what

17

this Court has called the "rule of precision" in First Amend­

18

ment cases.

19

of the statutory court which, while we felt it had far enough,

20

as witnesses by jurisdictional statement in the LSCCRC case,

21

we agree with the dissenting opinion of Judge Motley, in a

22

concurring opinion.

And, clearly, are in conflict with the decision

,

23

/

I nevertheless, want to call the Court's attention

24-

to this particular case.

The questions that we have in this

25

case, Questions 2 and 3, those dealing with all organisations

13

1

are questions which the Court has really called improper in

2

Shelton against Tucker.

3

discourage all political association -- political association

4

that is completely legitimate.

It is held that they go so far as to

And Judge Friendly pointed cut, as Your Honors will

5
6

see in the appendix in this casef Judge Friendly pointedout

1

that New York Courts — I think Justice Harlan probably was

8

aware of that, from the questions he put earlier — had with­

9

drawn such sections with respect to membership to all organisa­

10

tions and had redrawn them because of what Judge Friendly said:

11

"The awareness of the need to bring them inline with develop­

12

ing concepts of First Amendment rights."

13

specifically to Shelton versus Tucker and Schneider against
...

14

-

'

And he referred
y-

'V

S'mi ill.
Now, Question Number 1, a question relating to

15
‘16

membership in ar. organization advocating the overthrow of the

\7

government, has defects that I think will recognize some ©f thM

18

questions here, and that Judge Friendly pointed out — they

19

omit the absence of knowledge concerning the purposes of the

20

organization; they omit the absence of congruence, that is

21

membership at the same time that the organization had these

22

purposes.

23

24
25

-

.I

In addition to the two points made by Judge Friendly,
which resulted in New York changing its questions to import,
to include these two elements, we suggest that the elements
14

1

involved in Brandenburg against Ohio, or suggested by that,

2

namely: a specific intent to advance thepurposes offcthe

3

organization of which one is a member, are elements that also

4

should be called for in a question of this kind*

5

.And our concern, of course, is the fact —

6

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

7
3
9

that -Judge Friendly upheld the question insofar as the absence
of any aspect of knowledge with respect to the Communist Party?
He upheld that questioni didn't he?
MR. BOUDIN:

10

It

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:
MR. BOUDIN:

13

17

18
19

20
2t

22
23
24
25

Oh, wasn’t it?

And as I say, this Court has made its

decision, which we would hope it would reconsider -—
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

15
16

The question of the Communist Party

was not involved in the New York questionnaire.

12

14

Am I not right in thinking

that kind of a question.

Of course, Konigsberg sustains

The reeal question there is whether

with the passage of time and so forth,' the elements you are
arguing for, that the Court held was UliiigCes s ary.

That there

is something that ought to be modified, that's what the essence
of it is.
MR. BOUDIN:

Exactly.

I’m also suggesting one more

thing with respect to Communist Party questions, which, of
course, is not the question put here.

A Communist Party ques­

tion is a much more pointed question.
I'm suggesting that Your Honor's

15

opinion in

1

Barenblafct, Mr. Justice Harlan , and the opinion in Gibson , and

z

perhaps the sound reasons because we are in the First Amendment

3

area now, would indicate that that5s -— assuming that the

4

Communist Party membership question can ever be put, that is,

3

if the Court should reconsider whether it should is put, that

6

frame of the question should not be put in the absence of a

7

foundation, some reason to believe that there is cause to make

8

that particular inquiry of an individual.
Your honors stated that view in dealing with the

9

fO

question of a dragnqt inquiry in Barenblatt, in a different

n

context.

12

But, we8re suggesting that the deterrent effect upon

13

association here is one which would require that if even that

14

question could be put, it should be put —

15

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

You are taking on an awful

16

sweep of constitutional baggage here that you don't need to pre­

17

vail in this case.
MR. BOUDIN:

18

X must admit it? I think that my case

19

could be won very easily on the basis of —

20

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

21
22

Well, why (bn' t you argue your

lawsuit?
MR. BOUDIN:

Well, because I think that the public

23

problems are quite important and I know that the Court is con­

24

cerned, not only with the case I'm bringing here, but with the

25

general impact upon members of the bar.

16

And my concern is that

!

the large amount of activities which the Court knows the young

Z

law students are engaging in today —- activities in the south,

3

activities with the poor, activities with minority groups, a

4

panoply of activities, are going to he discouraged and are dis­

5

couraged if questions of this kind are permitted to be put.,

6

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

Do you really think that?

7

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

1 real! do think so, Your

8

Honor.
When I argued this matter before the statutory

9
10

court, Judge Bonsai raised the question.

n

also.

He sounded skeptical,

iz

If Your Honor will see the immediate opinion in

13

this case, the Court eventually recognised that what I have

14

said —- what the realities are of we who stand here and you who

15

stand there, are not as close to these young law students who

m

are engaged in work in the vineyards, and even I, who have been

17

involved in so many of these cases in the decade, am now

18

regarded as old hat; as conservative.

MR. CHIEF'JUSTICE' BURGER:

What does the work in the

20

poverty program, or the Office of Economic Opportunity got to

21

do with organizations advocating the overthrow of the government

22

by force and violence?

23

.MR. BOUDIN:

Well, I think one of the —because,

24

Your Honor, the distinction is the people who work among the

25

poor, who work for minority groups are often fighting against
17

1

authority.

z

They Eire regarded as dissidents; they are regarded as radicals;

3

and if I could suggest,, Your Honor, what I had forgotten to

4

mention here, Your Honor will notice in our brief what happened

5

when Mr. Stolar appeared before the committee and what the

S

committee said to him.

7

I'm using the word "fighting” in a genera.1 sense.

After having gone through — after they had per­

8

suaded lira to answer the generalised questions of dissective

9

nature, Ycur Honors will see on Page 6 of my brief that the

10

committee pressed him into specific questions and answers, and

n

that eventually he answered.

12

committee: "That he is not now, and has never been a member of

13

the Communist Party or any Socialist Party, or of the Students

14

|or a Democratic Society and that he has signed the standard

15

United States pre“induction Army oath with respect to a list of

16

organisations on the Attorney General's list.

17

And these are the words of the

In other words, the people who are engaged in work

18

generally, and who are members of one student organisation after

19

another, are met by this kind of specific inquiry under Ohio's
i

20

programs and what reason is there

21

that a student should be asked whether he is a member of any
Socialist Party.

All of this

that they should be asked —

arises, as I say, in the context

of Ohio's programs arh*. all of this is bound to discourage young
men from joining organisations, from joining student groups and
what we are doing, ultimately, is we are letting the decisions

18

1

to be made in these things, as they must be made, I suppose,

2

by character committees who make forays into First Amendment

3

protected activities here, and who live in a milieu which is

4

so different from young men who are in the law schools today,

5

and I have felt that recently in the law schools, and I have

6

been amazed in the differnt quality of the law students who

7

exist today than those who existed, even ten years ago.

a

And these students should not be discouraged by

9

questions of this kind that are put by Ohio, as to whether they

10

are members of Students for a Democratic Society, assuming that

11

there is such a single organization today.

12

They should not be discouraged by asking whether

13

they are members of a SocMist Party.

All of this arises, and

14

arises in the context, Your Honors will note, that nobody has

15

made any determination as to what the Court suggested is a

1©

different context, and I think, applicable here, enjoined Anti-

17

Fascist against McGrath, a determination that an organization

18

is an organization which one should not belong to.

19

free-wheeling sweep to the committee to make this inquiry.

It gives a

k

20

Nwo, with respect to the Communist Party, although

21

I have suggested that that should be reconsidered by the Court,

22

the Court has pointed out repeatedly: legislative farming,

23

legislative hearings, official hearings and so forth, but with

24

respect to matters other than the Communist Party, then it

25

certainly seams to me that somebody must have a hearing to
19

1

determine whether an organization should be on a list, if lists

z

are to be permitted, before we are to give committees the right

3

to ask questions concerning that.

4

And, of course, if we ask questions concerning any

5

organization, you are going beyond what the Court did in

S

Schneider against Smith when it talked about 250 organisations

7

and I refer to the concurring opinion in that case of Mr,

8

Justice Portas and Mr. Justice Stewart.

9

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

Were these — just one

10

question, Mr. Boudin, if I may — were these questions formulatet

11

by the Supreme Court of Ohio or by the Ohio State Bar Associa­

12

tions Committee, or by the Columbus Bar Association.

13

MR. BOUDIN:

I do not know? perhaps Ohio can say.

So far as we know, these are the forms used and I suspect --

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ROBERT D. MACKLIN,

Mr» Macklin, you may

the Court?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

At the outset it should be understood that the

rules of the Supreme Court of Ohio with respect to administration of bar admissions, place no burden upon the applicant to
prove his good moral character.

The procedure is actually one

of investigation performed by the admissions committees of seme
89 bar associations throughout the state.

Theirs is a service

to the profession, under the Ohio Supreme Court, and the
procedures of the bar association committees are provided for

16

by rule of the Supreme Court of Ohio.
17
18
19

20

The committees are responsible fbr investigating
the character, reputation and of all of the qualifications of
the applicant.

And they report their findings and their recom-

mendation to tha court, which, in the ultimata result, deter­
21

mines whether the candidate shall be, in the first instance,
22
registered as a candidate for admission to the practice of law,
23
or, in the second instance, whether he should be permitted to
24

take the bar examination.

One process precedes the other.

25

21

1

Each step of the procedure requires on the part of the appli­

2

cant, submission of a character questionnaire, which is utilized

3

by the local bar committee in performing its investigation.

4

And on the face of the form the applicant is advised that the

S

information may be used as a guide to further investigation.

6

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

There are two, aren't they?

7

One beginning on Page 5-A in the record inthe appendix, and the

3

second one, beginning on Page 49.

3
10

11
12
13

14

MR. MACKLIN:

That's correct, Mr. Justice.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

Now, who formulated this

questionnaire?
MR. MACKLIN:

It is my understanding that this

questionnaire was formulated by the Supreme Court of Ohio.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

By the Supreme Court of Ohio,

15

and for use throughout the state in all 88 counties?

16

MR. MACKLIN: Yes, Your Honor.

17

The various bar associations from time to time make

18

recommendations to the Supreme Court for a change in its rules

19

affecting these admission procedures, but to my knowledge there

20

has been no change in the format of the questionnaires, at least

21

for the past five years,

22

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

So, it's not incumbent upon

23

each one of the 88 or 89 coramittees to formulate its own

24

questionnaires to do the job.

25

MR. MACKLIN:

No, Your Honor.
22

It is incumbent upon

1

the committees to further the information that they obtain from

z

these questions.

3

As an applicant from out-of-state, the Petitioner

4

did not require registration as a law student.

5

submitted both forms simultaneously9 when he sought permission

s

to take the bar examination.

7

course, is that the second questionnaire is primarily desinged

8

merely to bring up to date the basic information provided for

9

in the first questionnaire.

Petitioner

And the reason for this, of

The Petitioner refused to answer two questions:

10

one dealing generally with membership in organisations; the

11
/

12

other as

whether he was a member of an organisation that

13

advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States

14

by force.

15

by the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

His refusal was based on his right, as guaranteed

On the second questionnaire —

20

students and it stated December of 1968 and he had been

tioner refused,

3

for the same reason as on the first questionnaire, to answer

9

a question involving membership in clubs, societies or organi­

10

11

sations since the period he registered as a law student.
After being duly warned of the effect upon the

12

investigation of a failure to answer these questions, Petitionee-

13

persisted in his refusal to answer, and based uoon this refusal,

14

the Bar Admission Committee recommended to the Supreme Court

15

of Ohio that Petitioner's application for admission to the

16

bar examination be denied.

the recommendation of the Admission Committee and denied the

18

application of the Petitioner to be admitted to the March, 1969

19

bar examination.

The Supreme Court of Ohio approved

The Petitioner has not raised in issue any quarrels

21

with the right of the Supreme Court of Ohio to determine: the

22

23

the moral fitness of such persons or such person is to be

in investigating the moral character of its applicants.

consider it hand-in-hand, part and parcel, together with techni -

3

cal qualifications of admission to the bar.
It must be appropriate to allow the court to

4
5

inquire into associations to the extent that the information

8

acquired thereby may be an aid of such legitimate purpose.

7

The function of the — both questionairres, for that matter,

3

is to provide the basic information as a guide in conducting

9

the investigation of applicants; nothina more.

There is no

'10

political test involved; there is no oath of lovalty involved?

11

and there are no proscriptions to mere membership in any

12

organizations.
Now, the thrust of the Petitioner's argument is the

Court of Ohio might do with -he kind of information that treats

might do.

of action by the Supreme Court of Ohio.

which have so carefully circumscribed areas of improper in­

MR. JUSTICE IIARLAH:

25

What would you sav is the

1

question calling for all organizations from the standpoint of

2

— specifically, what do you say -- how does this case differ

3

from Shelton and Tucker?

4

MR. MACKLIN:

Well, Mr. Justice Harlan, we look

S

upon disclosure of these associations as simply an entry into

6

the ability to discuss with other members of these associations

7

whether or not there are aspects of this person’s character or

8

his moral fitness, which may or may not have a bearing upon his

9

fitness for the bar.

10

It's strictly a matter of inquiry investi­

gation and nothing more.

11

We have no history, to my knowledge, in the state,

12

whereby mere association, mere membershipin an association has

13

resulted in an applicant being denied permission to take the

14

bar examination.

15

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Would you suggest that

16

this question is primarily directed to enabling inquiry about

17

the man at the organizations or among the members of the or­

18

ganizations that he was --

19

MR. MACKLIN:

Either members of the organization or

the associates he may have worked with in the organization.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, that may be a

fairly easy question for a man to answer when he’s 25, but let8!;
say when he get to, be 45 that gets to be a more difficult
question to answer.

Even if his memory hasn't failed, by that

time he has joined so many that he can't remember them all.

Isn't that a pretty difficult burden to put on the process?

But the question, be­

cause of its breadth, has a tendency to elicit that kind of an

of the second Konigsberg case is uniquely appropriate here.

so, state the facts fully.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:
MR. MACKLIM:

Where is that in the appendix?

I think that is contained, Your Honor

in our brief in opposition for petition for writ of certiorari
on Pages 17-A and 18-A in the appendix thereto.
The Petitioner responded "no," to this question.
MR. JUSTICE HAP.LAN:

Does New York have a require­

ment of listing all the organizations you have ever belonged
to in your entire life?
MR. MACKLXN:

I don't believe that New York has the

type of question exactly like the one in Ohio in regard to the
associations.

We really felt in Ohio that where the applicant or

19
20

Petitioner had answered similar questions -- at least it had
similar elements in it, to those which he refused to answer in
Ohio, on the basis of his rights as guaranteed by the Fifth

21
Amendment, that he thereby created an area of, at least, let's

22
say, perplexity on the part of those who were charged with the
.23
investigation of his moral character.

The question, of course,

24
would be: had something occurred in the intervening month that

28

would cause his answers to the Ohio questionnaire to be possibly

incriminating.

explanations but. the refusal of the Petitioner to answer, left

4

a complete void in this particular area of the investigation

being performed by the admissions committee.

6

the admissions committee were, literally, unable to complete

7

the full investigation and they could not logically make any

,8

recommendations to the Supreme Court of Ohio as to the moral

9

qualifications of the applicant.

to the action of the Supreme Court of Ohio in denying the
Petitioner's application.

We submit that the circumstances of

this case, which offered inconsistent statements, bring the
fundamental issue squarely within the principles of the second
Konigsberg case.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

16

Does the applicant have to

swear to this — take an oath?

57
MR. MACKLIN: Yes, Your Honor, he does.

18

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

By which he could be punished

19
20

for perjury?
MR. MACKLIN:

21

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Well, it might be a little

22
difficult, wouldn't it, for a man tobe able to swear whether

23
some organization believed in overthrowing the aovernment by

24
force.

I don't think there have been many of them that advertise

MR.JUSTICE BLACK:

13

intention to deceive; I’m talking about whether he belongs to

would be does he belong to an organization which did that, and

Yes, I would agree with you, sir.

But the fact pattern, we felt that this particular
case was even more appropriate to the principles in tie
Kenigsberg and Anastaplo cases.

We would urcre that this be a

controlling point from the standpoint of our state, and we
respectfully urge this Court to affirm the decisions of the
