ARGUMENT OF ROBERT ALLEN SEDLER

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SEDLER;

7

Thank you, Your Honor.

May it please

the Courts

The issues in this case arise out of the stated

9

refusal of petitioner Mulloy8s selective service board to re­

10

open his classification and consider his claim for conscientious

ii

objector status.

n

failure to reopen.

That is what we are dealing with here* a

13

We do not have the case where the board has decided

14

the claim,, at least officially, on the merits and where there

15

has been an appeal, or at least an opportunity for an appeal.

IS

So that the question before this Court would be whether -there

17

was a basis in fact for the determination.

18

The issue is not whether the petitioner was a conseien

19

fcious objector, but whether there was a basis in fact for a

29

substantive determination that he was not.

21

a procedural one.

22

of entitlement to classification as a conscientious objector

23

that he was entitled to an appealable determination by the board'

24
23

The issue is purely

Did the petitioner male© ©nought of a showing

I guess what this case is all about is that the
petitioner claims he was entitled to a full-scale determination
2

1

including the right of appeal.

z

The first issue then evolves around the summary dismissal.

3

The board summarily dismissed.

The petitioner has contended throughout these

4

proceedings that the board either was required to reopen,

5

because, based on his SSS Form 150 and the letters and other

6

information submitted in support of the claim, he made out a

7

prima facie case of entitlement, or that what really happened

8

was that the board in fact reopened, deciding the claim against

9

him on the merits, but denying him the appeal to which he

10
11

was entitled by the regulations.
In this Court the government now concedes — which

12

is a clear departure from its position heretofore *-- that

13

based on the SSS Form 150 and the supporting letters, the peti™

14

tioner made out a prima facie case for entitlement.

15

the government, even so, the board does not have to reopen.

IS

I think issue was drawn on that first point.

17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

But, says

The second issue —
Q

Do you think it can be told froir 'this record

what the reason for the board's action was?'

A

No, Your Honor, this is a point that we have

made, in that the board did not say why it found that he wasn't
a conscientious objector.
what the beard did.

But the record does clearly say

The Form 100, the face form, following

the November 9th meeting says, "Classification not reopened.5*
Following the meeting on January 11th, the SSS 100 Form reads,
3

1

’’All information in the file considered, including claim

2

of conscientious objector.”

3

did not warrant reopening of 1A classification, a vote 4 to 0.

4

The board felt that information

This was also brought out in the testimony

both

5

in the civil trial and the criminal trial, where Chairman Sherman

8

stated that taking'everything in the file, assuming what he

7

said to be true, he did not make out a case and he saw no reason

3

to reopen, because it wasn't there.

9

I think it is very clear that the board's reason for

10

its action was that the petitioner did not make out a prima

ii

facie case for entitlement.

12

both in the district court and before the Court of Appeals.

13

This was the government's argument

The Court of Appeals explicitly stated that petitione:;

14

did not make out a prima facie case, and, therefore, the board

15

was not required to reopen.

m

Wow we have contended all along that the only way

17

you can say that he didn't make out a prima facie case is to

18

totally distort the meaning of prima facie case and say that

19

prima facie case means the same thing as a merits determination.

20

I think that is the point that stands out most clearly in this

21

case, that there was nothing more that the board could have done

22

no further information that it could have considered, if it had,

23

in fact, reopened the classification.

24
25

But what it did was to say, "We don't think he is
a conscientious objector."

Now the board can say that.
4

But

1

under the regulations this constitutes a reopening in fact,

2

entitling the registrant to an administrative appeal under

3

Section 162513 c.

4

The second issue — and -this is, in a way, related

5

to the first — is

simply that he was denied due process,

6

because the board did not give him a full, fair hearing»

7

dicta91 read, the file.

8

scanning it, before making a determination that he didn't state

9

a prima facie case.

They

They, at best, looked through it,

There simply wouldn’t have been time at

to

a so-called "courtesy*'’ hearing for the three members who were

It

present to even scan, let alone read, the detailed answers to

12

SSS Form 150, let alone all the other information in the file.
Q

13
14

Does that necessarily, or possibly, .rest on an

assumption that they hadn't read it a little bit sooner?
A

15

They so stated.

There were three members pre­

16

sent, Your Honor, at the November 9th hearing.

57

the chairman, testified, "Well, we looked over his file before

18
19
20

21
22
23

24
25

he came in as we wsuld anyone else."

Mr. Sherman,

Now at that time -- and

the record in the civil trial will bear this out — there were
other registrants ahead of Mulloy; then MuHoy came into the
interview.

Mr. Downs said that the file was there, and. any

member who wanted to could look at it.
"Did you read it?"

I asked Mr. Downs,

And he said, "No, I just scanned it, because

I was the newest member of the board and I wasn’t familiar with
what, was in the file at all.”

Mr. Wo Iking said that he read it,
5

\

i

but he couldn't recall how much time he spent on it.

2

it is very clear from the evidence that these members didn’t

3

read the file.

1 think

4

vfe have also contended, as part of the same denial

5

of the full, fair hearing, that the demonstrable incompetence

6

of the draft board members v^as a denial of due process.

7

simply did not understand what a conscientious objector was.

a

The clerk testified that in her 17 years with the

9
JO

They

beard, no one had ever been assigned to civilian work as a
conscientious objector.

Mr. Sherman, the chairman of the board, thought that

11
12

a conscientious objector was one who was opposed to the use of

13

violence, which, of course, is not the statutory definition.
Mr. Downes didn't seem to realize that the board

14
15

had the power to determine whether a man was a conscientious

16

objector.

17

Mr. Wolking seemed to think that by applying for

18

conscientious objector status the registrant stated that he

19

would not do alternative civilian service.

20

Now I think this is the factual situation that we

21

are dealing with.

22

assumed that the petitioner was not sincere, otherwise», it

23

would have been inexplicable that they didn't reopen,

24
25

The government says that the board must have

I would suggest that there may be another reason, that
they neves: read the file, and that if they had read the file,
6

1

it wouldn't have made any difference, becasue they had no under­

2

standing of what a conscientious objector was.
The relevant time period is a fairly brief one.

1 think it is also fair to say that he believed that

if he were granted conscientious objector status, he might be

presumably qualify as alternative service in the national

interest under Section 1660.1 of the regulations.
If the members of the board had read his SSS Form 150,

they would have understood the correlation between his work

in Appalachia and his claim of conscientious objector status.

X think it is the height of sophistry to say that a young man,

11

not learned in the law, who by law can't be represented by counse

before these draft boards, can suddenly have his claim for

conscientious objector status converted into a claim for

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

19

Mr. Connolly,
ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH J. CONNOLLY

20

OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

21

MR. CONNOLLY:

22
23
24
28

Thank you* Counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Since Mr. Sedler has taxed the government for chang­
ing its position during this litigation * it seems appropriate
17

1

for me to restate the government5s position at the outset of

2

my argument.

3

I will briefly describe and -then return to each in more

4

detail.

1 think I can do so in two propositions,, which

The first proposition relates to what we believe

5
6

to be the basic issue of law in this case.

That is:

what

7

inquiries can a local board make and what issues can it resolve

8

concerning a request for reclassifications, without the board

9

being deemed to have, in fact, reopened the classification.
Section 1625.4 of the regulations clearly specifies

10
1!

two issues which are for the primary determination by the

12

board in deciding whether to reopen.

13

the facts alleged by the registrant, if true, would justify a

14

change in the registrant"s classification.

15

is whether the facts presented are new facts, which were not

16

considered by the board at the time the registrant was

17

classified.

The first is:

whether

The second issue

The discretionary language of 1625.2 also demonstrates

18
19

that there are other issues which may be resolved by the board

20

without a reopening.

21

certain circumstances, decide that critical facts are not true

22

and, therefore, that reclassification would not be justified.
The board also may reach certain conclusions about

23
24
25

Thus, we believe that the board may, in

the

facts alleged and deny reopening on that basis.

Thus, in

certain narrowly defined cases— which 1 will illustrate
18

1

presently — the board may conclude that -the registrant's

2

civilian work is not in the national interest or that his claim

3

of conscientious objection is not a sincerely held belief.

4

Interpreted in this manner, we believe that the

5

regulation affords a necessary flexibility to the Selective

6

Service System to dispose of meritless applications without

7

full administrative procedures.

S

show in our brief — in order to prevent the

3

system from becoming bogged down with such applications and to

This is necessary — as we
administrative

10

prevent disingenuous registrants from postponing and perhaps

11

avoiding military service.
Cur second proposition relates to the facts of this

12

13

case.

14

to conclude that the petitioner had not set forth facts which

15

would classify a conscientious objector classification,, because

16

the true premiss for his claim was his belief in the impor­

17

tance of his work in Appalachia.

18

We submit that what the local board did in this ease was

This is a determination which the board, is clearly

19

authorized to make.

And, as I hope to demonstrate later in

20

this argument, the board had a rational basis cn the facts of

2!

■this case for making that determination.

22

Mr. Sadler has stated that the government has

23

conceded that there was a prima facie basis, a prima facie case,

24

for reclassification.

25

and I should clarify our position.

The government has made this concession,

19

i

We believe that certain of the facts set forth in

2

petitioner's Form 150 and in the accompanying letters, taken

3

together with all doubts resolved in favor of the petitioner

4

and with all inconsistent information disregarded, would have

S

constituted a prima facie case.

6

But -the question for the local board was whether it

1

should try to piece together the favorable information, resolve

8

doubts in favor of the petitioner, and disregard his own

9

statements that seemed inconsistent with his claim.
-hat was the question which the board resolved after

10

11

its courtesy interview with the petitioner.

It decided that

12

there was no reason to reopen, because the facts, as explained

1.3

by the petitioner, did not justify reclassification.
Now as to the point of law involved in this ease.

14

1

15

would like to give three illustrations of what I think would be

16

the government's position as to what inquiries the board can

17

make without reopening and what issues it can resolve without

18

reopening.

19

I think the first illustration was illicited in Mr.

20

Sedler's colloquy with Mr. Justice Stewart, concerning the

21

question whether the registrant is a student at X College,

22

whether he is a United States Senator, or perhaps, whether his

23

wife is pregnant as he alleges.

24
25

We believe that the discretion granted to the board
in Section 1625.2 allows the board to inquire into that critical
20

!

fact, if true, and if the fact is not true then to deny

2

reopening on that basis.

3

The second illustration that I would give is a

4

situation «here a registrant claims that he is employed in the

3

national interest.

S

employed in an. electronics factory making radar scopes for

7

jet fighter planes.

Let's suppose that he says that fee is

3

Now in that case we would believe that the board —

9

if there is no reason to doubt the truth of the fact — would

10

be required to reopen and. consider that claim on the merits.

11

The situation might be different if it were another

12

case in which the registrant alleged that he was employed in

13

such and such a factory, and the board had very recently

14

decided in a case on the merits that someone doing exactly what

13

this registrant was doing was not in the national interest,

IS

perhaps, in that case, the board would be justified in declining

17

to reopen without full consideration.
The third example in this area would almost fee

IS
19

humorous when in a situation which is very clear that the

20

occupation is not deferable, such as a Good Humour salesman or

21

something like that.

22

reopening.

23

We think that the board could deny a

Now the third example is the situation of the

24

conscientious objector.

As the cases illustrate there are two

25

issues for the board to resolve on the merits in that case.
21

1

First is:

2

that is, what does he say that he believes concerning his

3

moral objection to participation in war? what is the nature of

4

that belief.

5

what is the character of the registrant's belief

The second issue is the sincerity of his belief.

That

6

is:

does he really, genuinely believe what he says he believes

7

about participation in war, or is this a claim of convenience.
Q

Would you agree, Mr. Connolly, with your

Q

The Second is flatly against this decision,

A

Yes, it is.

isn’t it?
It has illustrated its position,

in somewhat of a different context in the Gearey cases.

But,

of course, those cases did involve a claim of conscientious
objection made after an induction notice has been sent.

But

very similar issues are presented by this case.
We would submit that in most instances that

21

second issue for the board to resolve, that I said, whether

22

tills man really believes what he says he believes, what is in

23
24
25

his mind, is a question that could not be resolved by the
board without a reopening to give the registrant a formal
opportunity for appearance before the board and an appeal

22

?

to the state appeals board

2

We would say, however, that there might be certain

3

cases in which even -that claim, that issue could be resolved

4

by the board without a reopening.

3

his conscientious objection to military service is based, for

6

example, upon study in a monastery, in a divinity school or

7

a strong association with a peace church or a peace group, and

8

the board finds by reliable means that those allegations are

9

untrue, it might make the decision, without reopening, that

10
11

If the registrant claims that

this registrant is insincere in his claim.
I think that is a justifiable decision in this case,

12

and la all these other lines of cases, if there is any

13

prejudice that would result to the registrant in that case,

14

in any of those cases, from the board3s erroneous view, the

15

registrant could learn what the reason for the local board9b

IS

decision was,, and if it secured erroneous information, he could

17

correct the record, and the case would proceed from that point.

18

Q

You say if the board finds by reliable means

19

that what he says is not true or where they find that they

20

think it is not true, what sort of reliable means are they

21

going to find out about this?

ZZ

his allegation.

23

24
25

All they have is his statement,

There is no response as 1 understand it.

A

That is right.

Q

It is not an adversary proposition.

A

They could write a letter, depending upon what
23

1

the claim was , write a letter to ‘the source from which that

2

claim originates, the referent in a statement of fact.

3

if the referent writes back in a letter that looks like it comes

4

from the referant that says, "1 have never heard of the

5

registrant? he has never been engaged in any peace work with

6

our organization, never been employed in our plant,

7

attended our school,w I would submit that that would be a basis

8

for the board saying, "No, you haven't made out a case? you

9

haven’t alleged, facts which, if true, would justify your

10
11

12
13

And

reclassification.”
Q

Bo selective service boards actually write

letters to these referents?
A

I don't know.

1 do know that they verify

14

academic deferments in some way through correspondence with

15

the universities and colleges.

IS

Q

The usual practice I suppose is to have the

17

registrant, himself, when he applies for reclassification to

18

supply -die documentary support for it. Isn’t that the basis?

19

A

That is usually done, but 1 believe there is

20

some practice of verifying with the board.

2!

nothing in the regulations which would preclude the board from

22

doing -that.

23

board will do -that.

tions that the local board was confronted with in this case#

Mr. Connolly# do you assume as has been charged

that the board didn't know what it was doing?
A

U

I would like to speck to that.

At this time,

13

perhaps, dispose of it.

We discussed it at some length in our

16

brief# and I don’t intend to go into it very deeply.

17

disagree with Mr. Sedlei-’s statement that the decision was

18

made to deny reopening on 'the afternoon of November the 9th,

19

although there is some support in the record for Mr. Sedler’s

20

statement.

I believe that the record taken as a whole# including
the further testimony, including the testimony of a board

25

member who wasn’t even there at that interview, but who read
the file, read the summary of his interview and then decided on
January II to vote against reopening.
28

I think that the record

1

as a whole shows that, even though there might haw been a

2

predisposition against reopening by those members who were

3

present at the November the 9th meeting, that that disposition

4

did not ripen into a decision until January

5

all read the file and until they had given it mature considera-

, until they had

The question as to whether they knew what they were

doing,

record at all.

10

ination of ’what

1?

members which related very, very specifically to the labels

would concede to be inarticulate board

of classification to be given.

can be concluded on that basis that these board members were,

I believe Mr, Sedler has used the

word, incompetent to decide

of work that was in exchange for being not drafted,

And then

somebody tells him, "Look, if you are a conscientious objector,
you have to state fully that you want this because you are a

And then he says it.

He could be

A

believe so, but we had —~
29

2
3

Q

But in this case you have the two of them

combined together without any means of your separating them.
A

That is right, but I think that what we have

4

to look to in this case is that there was a proceeding; there

5

was a personal interview with the registrant before the local

6

board in which he did have that chance to separate out the

7

considerations, to tell the local board exactly what his

8

religious beliefs were and what his conscientious beliefs

9

were, to focus on them and to alleviate any possible confusion

10
11

which the board had.
We have two board members, after that, interview — in

12

which we must presume that they gave him fair consideration

13

at that time, fairly tried to resolve any doubts — they said

!4

that what this man essentially wants, what he considers

15

important is his work with the Appalachian Volunteers.

16

To illustrate that, Mr. Justice, X would like to jump

17

ahead of myself and .go to the letter which petitioner wrote

to his local board after that interview.

what he had before, the opportunity to continue his organizing
work in Appalachia.

I think that is clearly demonstrated by

his subsequent letter..

2

Q

This type of communication from him probably

3

explains why the board felt he was a sincere«ven if, perhaps,

4

confused young man»

5

A

I think that is right, Mr. Chief Justice.

And

6

while you mention the point, I would like to go back and

7

clarify any ambiguity which might have arisen from the govern­

8

ment’s brief on the question of sincerity.

9
10
11
12

We believe that the question before the board is —
the question that the board phrased for itself iss

this is a

very sincere young man, but is he a very sincere what?

And the

way that the board resolved ‘that was that he was a very' sincere

13

Appalachian Volunteer, who believed that it was essential for

14

him, as a matter of conscience for him, to remain in his present

15
16
17
18
IS
20
21

22
23
24
25

work, organising the poor in Appalachia.
The board did not in any way suggest that the
petitioner would be mendacious or less than candid with them.
I think that it decided that what the petitioner wanted was
continuation of his classification.
I am just going to take some highlights from the
petitioner's selective service conscientious objector form,
which is Form 150, and is printed at the beginning of page 15
of the appendix.

To go over to page 16, there is a series of

questions which the petitioner answered at length in an
appendix; he didn’t use the forms.
32

j

Question no. 3 was;

1

Explain how, when and from

2

whom or from what source you received the training and acquired

3

the belief which is the basis of your claim made in series L

4

The claim made in series 1 was that he was conscientiously

3

opposed to military service in any form.
Ha began his long answer to that question on page

6

7

19 of the appendix.

It starts by saying that he was born to

8

Catholic parents and inspired by missionary orders and had,

9

apparently. Catholic school training up through high school,

10

then became deeply troubled and faced a religious crisis and,

II

incidentally, attempted suicide.
Then after that, he s§ys he began to get back on

12
13

the right track and carae under the influence of Thomas Merton,

14

who was then residing in a monastery there in Eastern Kentucky.

13

He says that Merton was very influential in his formulating

16

his views.

17

Then he reaches in, on page 21, for the whole rest

18

of the answer to talk about the inspiration of his work as an

19

Appalachia Volunteer.

20

of page 21, I suppose;

21
22
23

2.4
23

His credo is set forth at the bottom
"As I grew and participated in the

world, I was able to determine a priority on the things I
learned as a child.

Thus, I place love of my fellow man above

regular church attendance, and I place "Thou shalfc not kill"
above "An eye for an eye18,

This appears to be a culmination of what he should

10

It is our position that the ambiguities inherent

in that statement, and in other statements, which I, perhaps,

14

will get a chance to read, plus statements of the registrant

15

which so plainly indicated to him the primary importance of

16

his work, tended to justify the board's conclusion — or did

17

justify the board's conclusion that it ought not to try to

18

piece together the various, individual statements which might

19

have justified a reclassification in order to decide whether to

reopen„

We don't doubt, Mr. Justice, that if you did do what
1 suggested early in the argument, to piece all of these little
statements together, in what you might regard as a brief for
the conscientious objector, to resolve any ambiguities in his
favor, and to disregard the significant emphasis on his belief
34

in the importance of his job, that you could conclude --

I know that you are justifying it on a set of

you, because the Court of Appeals seemed to indicate in one

It is not a strong record.

If I have to reach

to that point, then I can't elaborate on the record,” I can just
say what it says.

But in answer to an ultimate statement, what

S tried to do early in the argument is to say that there may be
enough here if you piece it together the right way.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Connolly.

Mr. Sedler# you have five minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT ALLEN SE'DLER

3

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

4
5

MR. SEDLERs

Thank you# Your Honor.

6

To get back to the first, point, that I made.

The issue

7

before this Court is not whether petitioner Mulloy is a.

8

conscientious objector or whether there is a basis in fact for

9

a board’s merit.decision followed by an appeal that a man was

10

not a conscientious objector.

The issue before'the Court isi

?1

was the board required to reopen and give the man an appeal?

12

That is all we were asking in this case# is to have an appeal.
The government has gone through the file pointing

13
14

out that the board could have found this and the board could

15

have found that.

IS

the board could have done this.

17

For purposes of argument let’s assume that
Under the regulations this

decision is also to be made by an appeals board.
In this case it is the petitioner who is arguing for

18
19

adherence to the regulations# and it is the government who is

20

arguing

21

which it can find no support.

22
23

24
25

for a broad interpretation of the regulation for

She clear scheme of -the regulations is that merits
determinations are to be reviewed.

When a man makes out a

prima facie case or a new classification — the CO claim had
never been made before — assuming that there is an issue of

37

1

of material, fact —• and certainly the government’s argument

£

Makes it clear that there was such an Issue — then the

3

procedure provided for in the regulations is for the hoard to

4

reopen, make a decision, then give the man a personal appear-

5

ance so that he can fully tell his side of the story, present

6

his version, try to correct the board,

7

keeps him in that classification, the case is reviewed by

8

•the appeals board.

Then if the board still

That is all we are talking about here, should there
have been an appeal.

The consequences that the government

11

talks about, are Imaginary,

12

boards have been required to reopen whenever a prima facie case

In all of the other Circuits

The draft hasn't stopped functioning.

All

that it has meant is that people will get a fair chance.
The present petitioner is under a sentence of S
years of imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 following a

7

determination that is basically made for 10 minutes.

government has attributed these highly sophisticated mental
processes to the beard.

They never carefully went through the SSS Form 150,

lawyers were allowed to appear before draft boards,, we could

clear some of -these things up.

a board member ask him, "Now, Mr. Malloy, let's be clear.

What are you claiming?

asked him that.

Classification as a conscientious

de-ferment?”

Nobody asked him any questions at all.

He was entitled to assume that they read the record,

16

but they didn't.

17

that these proceedings are fair and regular.

13

with all due deference, that you can’t presume that on the

record that we have here, because the board members simply did

not read the file.

21

We are told that we are supposed to presume
I would submit,

We are talking about the most difficult classification

22

here, that of conscientious objector.

23

throughout assumed the sincerity of the petitioner? they assumed

24

that he was sincere in his beliefs.

23

The board members

Those beliefs are essentially religious beliefs
39

1

This is clear from the reading of the Form .150; it is clear

2

from the letter from the Catholic priest; it is clear from

3

the other evidence in the file.

4

I would submit that there is no evidence in the file

5

at all that is inconsistent with the claim of conscientious

objector status.

7

the procedural question, is when does a draft board have to

reopen.

So that what the issue comes down to, on

We would submit that a board must reopen whenever

a pre-induction claim is made for a new classification.
