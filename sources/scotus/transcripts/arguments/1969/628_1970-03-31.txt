Why would it be a constitutional ques­

Under the holding of the O'Brien decision it is our
contention whether or not he is entitled to an instruction on

10

the statutory — exception to the main statute, the Government

has exhibited no compelling interest in controlling whether or

not one may wear distinctive parts of an Armed Forces uniform

13

or parts similar to distinctive parts.

Yes, sir.

Q

When you told my brother Brennan that there was

17

no substantial dispute to the facts in this case, doss that mean

18

you do concede that your client was wearing the uniform or dis­

IS

tinctive part thereof of any the Armed Forces of the United State s?

20

A

"Ir. Justice Stewart, I would concede only that he

had on parts of a military uniform, but would not characterize

22

it as distinctive.

23

Q

Well, it has to be.

As I read it, it has to be

24

the uniform, which I suppose would mean the complete uniform or

25

a distinctive part thereof.

Isn't that what this statute says?

A

Yes, sir.

Q

And do you or don’t you concede that the .. -

Yes.

underwear, I wouldn’t know, or tan shoes.
A

Excuse me, sir.

It doesn’t really matter to us if !

13

we want to characterize it as having worn the distinctive part.

14

Our point, we feel, is still the same.

15

Q

I am not sure that I understand whether I under-

16

standyou and

17

whether you don’t concede that the dress, the garb in which the

10

petitioner was dressed at this time was within the statutory

19

definition.

I am not sure that I understand whether you do or

question iswhether or

The uniform or a distinctive part there.

That is

24

what the statute says, and if he was not, of course he wasn’t

covered by this statute at all.

All right, and. it is our contention that is one of j

the problems of the statute.

8

9

We have no way of telling whether

There wasn't any evidence at all that he was wear­

ing an entire uniform?
A

12

Ho.

But we don't know that they did not convict

13

lim on the ground that he was wearing a part similar to a dis­

14

tinctive part.

Q

15
16

They at least found that he was wearing a dis-

tinctive part»

17

That's right.

That was the order of distinction.

In order to convict him, do you have to define

22

A

Yes, sir.

23

Q

What did the evidence show he was wearing?

An eagle insignia turned upside down.

21

that?
That would be the prerequisite finding.

An eagle insignia turned upside down with an obso- \

that is the ——

A

Spread eagle, yes, sir,

12

Q

—- on the commissioned officer's cap of the United

13

States Army?

14

A

The spread eagle, yes, sir»

15

Q

Is it that kind of an eagle?

16

A

Yes, sir,

17

The Government would seek to tell us to justify the

10

imposition or impingement of Danny Schacht * s First Amendment

19

rights, the right to wear these parts of the uniform on the

20

basis the Government has some sort of overwhelming interest in

21

regulating this wearing.

22

It is our contention from the facts at file that the

23

Government, in fact, sells to jobbers all over the nation the

24

parts of the uniform which later end up in the hands of the

25

people who wear it.
10

1

This Court might take note of the fact that the Array

2

jacket is worn by many people, the Army raincoat, parts that

3

look similar to parts of an Army uniform are widespread worn

4

by young people, especially by young people, and if the inter-

5

est in regulating this wearing were so overwhelming that it would

6

appear to us that the Government would not sell on a wholesale

7

basis to jobbers across the nation.

8

If there is a Government interest in the distinctive

9

wearing, they simply have not sought to assert that interest.

I

Wsj

10

have been unable to find very many cases under the statutes wherej

11

convictions have occurred under 18702.

12

since 1940, and I believe the statute in one form or another has 1

There are, in fact, four i

.

13

been on the books since 1916.

14

Q

What should we draw from that?

That the Government

18

has been negligent in enforcing this statute or what is your

16

point?

17
18
19

20
21

A

My point appears to be that there is some evidence

that the Government is not interested in enforcing this statute.
Q

Oh, what should the Court do about that when it

gets a case where they are interested in enforcing it?
A

In this particular case, we feel it is evidence

22

of the Government's lack of compelling interest in regulating

23

the wearing and, therefore, impinging his constitutional rights.

24
25

Q

Is there — I suppose there is.

Do you know if

there is other Federal legislation making it a criminal offense

11
'

i

to impersonate an officer or enlisted man of the Army?

2

A

'Yes, sir, 1 read the statute ---

3

Q

There is.

4

A

There is, yes, sir.

And that would be our point,

3

that this kind of protection could be guarded for the Government

e

by a more narrowing drawn statute»

7
8

Q

And you say there is such more narrowly drawn

A

I believe there is a penalty for impersonating an

statut-e.

0
10

officer, very definitely, for making a meal-ticket of a uniform

11

in one way or another»
I raise briefly the question of the vagueness of the

12

13

statute.

We feel that if the Court should find that if there is

14

some compelling interest in regulating the wearing of distinctive

15 parts of the uniform, that there is sfci.ll a question under the
16

statute 18702 as to what"authority authorized' means under the

17

statute, to whom does one turn for authority and the concomitant

18

question under what conditions the authority will be granted.
And we don’t know what "similar to distinctive parts"

19
20

means.

It is hard to tell that that would apply to a woman wear!

21

a khaki dress with epaulettes on it.
At the trial Denny sought to rely on 10 U.S.C. 772(f),

22
23

exception to the statute in the main.

24

he is not entitled to a submission on this issue.

25

he was.

The Government says that
We say that

We say that even if we accepted the Government's definiti
12

1

of what a theatrical production is, he may still be entitled

2

to the submission of the issue.
The trial judge, the U. S. district attorney and the

3
4

Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals saw no problems with the submissic

3

of this issue.

6

by the facts at the trial.

7
8

Q

At the very minimum, we feel the issue was raised

Is there any indication in the record as to where

he acquired these clothes?

S

A

No, sir, there is not.

10

Q

There is not.

11

Q

Going back to your point for a moment about the

12

compelling interest, I don't recall in the last — there may have

13

been some — but I don't recall in the last 14 years any frequen­

14 cy of prosecutions for impersonating a Federal agent.

Would you

15

draw from that that the Federal Government, has lost its interest

16

in prosecuting people for impersonating Federal agents, or per­

17

haps would another inference be that there have not been very

18

many people doing it?
A

19

Yes, of course, that inference could be drawn, but

20

we say that doesn't preclude us from the other inference that the

21

Government simply has, because of the widespread wearing of the

22

parts of the uniform, that the Government has lost its interest

23

in enforcing the statute.

24
25

Q

What do we have in this record of the widespread

use?

If it can be agreed that,

We feel that the words "tend to discredit" are uncon­

And then it is unconstitutionally conditioned on the substance

22
23
24
23

Further,

There is another contention in the Government's brief
that in the cases where this Court has waived the rule and I
think specifically the Heflin case, the Government did not submit
a brief and, therefore, it is not bound by its holding.
As we understand its contention, we feel it should fail
22

in that it is the business of the Court to raise the question of

jurisdiction itself.

Having considered that point, we do not

Q

You don't see any difference between a delay of

A

We will rest on our brief on that.

8

Q

It is a distinction made by Government, you know»

9

A

As 1 understood it, the distinction by the Govern­

10

ment, it was that there were statutes which prohibit a granting

of cert after 90 days.

12

Q

That is the outside limit of any statutory length

13

of time, and that the power of the Court is only to shorten the

14

time within that 90 days.

That is their submission, isn't it?

15

A

Yes, it is.

16

Q

Does the record show why this delay occurred?

17

A

Yes, it does, Your Honor.

There was a submission.

Nevertheless, there is no

I raised the question with my associates and they said,

21

"Oh, it is not jurisdictional."

I was puzzled by that, but there

22

are a lot of things that I find puzzling and we don't always

23

answers to.

24

until this case came, when the Court granted certiorari 131

25

lays after the judgment of the court below.

I went along and noticed those cases continuing

24

1 couldn't see any reason why if they could grant it

1

2

131 days, it. could not be granted 1,131 days or at any tame, and

3

I asked ray associate, Mr, Cormally, to look into it and we dug

4

into it rather thoroughly and I will endeavor to summarize here

5

what we found in loking into it.
Of course, there was originally the basic statute of

6
7

8

9
10

1925, which provided a period of three months for certiorari
with respect to all types or judgments with a power in the Court ;
or a justice of the Court to extend that for 60 days on an
application made within, the three months * period.
Then in 1933 Congress authorised the Court by a statute

11
12

which says that the Court shall have the power to prescribe —

13

and I think "prescribe" has some significance — from time to

14

time rules of practice — and I think "rules" has some signifi­

15

cance."

16

rules made as herein authorized may prescribe the times for and

17

manner of taking appeals and applying for writs of certiorari.

18

In the committee reports at that time, they read in a

And by an amendment mads in 1934, it was provided that ti e

19

way which sounds contemporary:

"Existing rules of the United

20

States District Court and Circuit Courts of Appeals lend them­

21

selves to delay.

22

Courts for months and even years have elapsed since the verdict

23

of guilty, and cases have not finally been disposed of in the

24

United States Circuit Courts of Appeals, and the accused have

25

been at large on bail.

Many cases are now pending in the Federal

Nothing tends more to discredit the

25

'i

2

administration of criminal justice than such delays.
There was an article by Professor Orfield, who has been

a member of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules, which

referred to the time limits in Rule XI, which was adopted xn

IS34 and which fixed a single period of 30 days, referred to
that as jurisdictional.
And then the next thing that happened was, rather to my
surprise and due to the careful work of Mr, Connally, we find
that the very question was decided by the Court in United States
ex rel Coy against the United States, 316 U.S. 342, where a peti­
tion for certiorari was filed more than 30 days after the judg­
ment and the. Court said, on page 344,

"The petition for certiorar

was filed too late and we cire without jurisdiction,"
Q

Is that case in your brief?

A

Oh, yes, this case is the essence of my brief,

Mr, Justice,

The Court also referred in the Coy opinion, saying |

Now, since 1934 when Rule XI was first adopted, the

rules have gone through various changed.

And the Advisory Committee at that time in its note said

15

18

’This rule continues existing law except that it grants to the
Supreme Court or a justice thereof the authority to extend the

Now of course the existing law included not only the tax

drafts of the rules of 1946, • the Coy case is cited, so that it,

The next case we have is the United States against

Judge Smith had granted a new trial long after the five

that he had done it sua sponte, that the rule-

And that is where

But I suggest that the power to prescribe them is not

16
17

derived from some inherent judicial power of this Court to manage

18

its own business, but it is still derived from the Acts of 1932

23

Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask you a question.

24

You are saying in this case, which is 129 days overtime, that it

25

is jurisdictional.

Suppose it had been one day overtime.

don't like than in cases in which you are interested.
A

Well, in one of these cases where you have written

23

an opinion, you referred to the fact that the Court has discre­

24

tion for granting, and I suggest that putting it on discretion

25

is, in effect, a denial of the fact that, the statutory power is

31

j

to grant rules and is a recognition of the fact that this is not

Yes, Mr. Justice.

---says that the petition in civil cases must be

20

A

With an extention of 60 days.

21

Q

Whereas here we are dealing with a criminal case

22
23
24
25

where we have no comparable explicit statute, do we?
A

No, Mr. Justice.

But what you have is a statute

authorizing the Court to prescribe by rule the time, and I am
suggesting that the practice which has grown up of doing this on j

32

6

A

Oh, yes, Mr. Justice, X suspect that you could

Yes, Mr. Justice, my position is that although

rule, that is a piece of delegated legislation.
That is made pursuant to the authority granted by Con-

10
11

gress in what is now found in 18 U.S.C. 3772.

Q

12
13
14
15

Now you are speaking of the rule-making power

where it is unilateral or where it is with the concurrence of
Congress?
A

In this case, it is unilateral.

In the case of

16

proceedings after verdict, Congress has given to the Supreme

17

Court power to prescribe by rule a time for filing petitions for

18

certiorari ---

19

'

Q

And the essence, I gather, Mr. Solicitor General,

20

is that if we prescribe a time period, that has precisely the

21

same effect as if it had been written into the enabling law ifcsel:

22
23

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, that would be my position.

think that that was what was contemplated by Congress.

I think

24

that is what the words "prescribed by rule" mean.

25

the understanding of the informed commentators at the time,

34

I

That was clear

*»
<p

Professor OrfieId, for example, referred to the fact that the

2

rule is jurisdictional, and that was the almost contemporaneous

3

iecision in the Coy case»
Now 'I referred to the fact that the language has changed

4
S

to r,ma''."

It also changed to "may" with respect to appeals, and

s

this Court in the Robinson case in 361 D.S. — this is cited in

7

3ur brief — and involved a late filing of a notice of appeal

3

and the Court held that the "may" language there was compulsory,

9

that the appeal — that the Appellate Court got no jurisdiction

to

«hen the appeal was filed more than five days late, and it quoted

it

«ifch approval the language of United States against Smith, the

12

phrase about "lingers on indefinitely."

13

And in concluding its opinion, it said something fur­

14

ther, which seems to me to be relevant here, that powerful policy

35

arguments may be made both for and against greater flexibility

30

tfith respect to the time for taking of an appeal is, indeed,

17

evident, but that policy question, involving as it does many

13

weighty and conflicting considerations, must be resolved through

19

the rule-making process and not by judicional decision.

20
21

22
23
24
25

If by that process the Courts are ever given power to
extend the time for the filing of a notice of appeal upon a
finding of excusable neglect, it seems reasonable to think that
some definite . limitation upon the time within which they may do
so would be prescribed.
So, it seems to me that the case, is tolerably clear.
35

1

The purpose of the rules was to cut down delays, to restrict

2

time.

3

and delegated the authority to cut down the time to the Court,

4

Congress was not clear just how much would he workable

And then there is the language of the statutory authori­

S

zation, power to prescribe by rule.

And then there is the lan­

6

guage of the rules themselves, the rules provide that the peti­

7

tion should be filed within 30 days.

8

that a justice may extend the time within 3Q days and then, there |

9

is a very interesting further provision in the rules of the

They provide, further,

10

Court, in Rule XXXIV, that whenever any justice of this Court is I
’

11

empowered by law to extend the time and applications seeking such;

12

extension must be presented to the Clerk within the period sought

13

to be extended.

14

There it is "must," not "may.”

15

And, finally, there is a decision of this Court in the

16
17

It is specific.

Coy case, in 316 U.S., and in the Smith and Robinson cases.
Now what happened to upset this clear picture?

Nothing \

18

deliberate.

19

granting certiorari, the Court expressly directed the attention

20

of counsel to the question of the time limits involved and asked

21

that that question be briefed, and it was.

22

the Court ever had briefing and argument in these cases in which

23

certiorari has been granted after the time that it expired.

24
25

Q

I may point out that in the Coy case, in the order

But at no time has

Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask at the time Coy

was decided did the predecessor of Rule XXII read as Rule XXII
36

i

>w reads?

2

A

Yes, Mr, Justice, it was Rule XX of the 1934 Rules,

3

Q

But the phrasing was the same?

4

A

It read exactly the same except for the change of

5

"shall" to “may," to which I have already referred, and to the

6

fact that at the time Coy was decided, there was no power to

7

extend the time.
Q

8

10
11

wording.

14

A

I think that is essentially the language of the

1925 Act with respect to civil cases, in which they were simply

j

carried forward.
Now--Q

16

10

It is phrased not that a petition is out of time unless

time when filed within 90 days.

15

17

The reason I ask you this is it is rather unusual

filed within 90 days, but that a petition shall be deemed in

12
13

!

Before you go on, I think I misunderstood part of

j

your argument in your brief, because here in oral argument in
response to a question from Mr. Justice Black, you said that you:
.

19
20
21

jurisdictional argument would be precisely the same if this case
were one day

late, rather than over 100 days late.

And I

of your brief — well, I understand that you make

that as your basic argument.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I recognize tha one-day

5

to have some time limit on it," and the only feasible one is the;

21

Q

Well, it seems to me at. the place where

I misunderstood you then, because I understood you

22

to say to Mr. Justice Brennan that you thought it would be con­

I can find no reason why it is

18

not equally unjustifiable in terms of this Court's own rules.

19

Now with respect to all of these things, if the rules

so construed are too inflexible, then I submit that the change

21

should, come through the rule-making process and not in essence by

acquiescence.

This is a provision which makes it a crime for an unauthorised

person to wear the uniform or any distinctive part thereof.

i

Incidentally, let me clear up one possible misconception

7

which came from the petitioner's argument.

He suggested that

8

there might be a simulation of the uniform here,

9

the indictment is simply that he did wear a distinctive part of i

But actually

10

official uniform and the trial was conducted throughout on the

11

basis that he wore a distinctive part of the uniform.

12
13
U

There is no basis for saying that it was something
which simulated the 'uniform.

Q

And what was given in Houston?

7

A

It was given in Washington, which is close to the

Pentagon, and where other things have happened.,
Biit there is no doubt that that is a simulation and hers;

9
10

there was a considerable reason, to doubt whether the person

ti

involved was or was not a member of the Armed Forces.
Now, petitioner here, perhaps his oral argument belies

12

13

this, but as I read his brief it seemed to me that he made no

14

claim that he did not come within the terms of the statute.

15

is, that he was wearing a distinctive part of the uniform.

That

It seems to me to leave no question which was not, in

16

17

substance, covered by this Court's decision in the United States

18

against O'Brien, the case involving the burning of a draft card.

Surely there is power in Congress to protect the integrity of the

20

uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States.

citizens.

That seams to be the con­

Not 1 have seen plenty with button on.

A

Mr» Justice, if I can get to that case soon enough,

13

maybe I could exercise some prosecutorial discretion in respect, t :v

16

that case.

17
18
19
20
2!
22.

23

24

That seems to me to be a situation where discretion

might be appropriate,
In^this case where the prosecutor exercised his discre­
tion otherwise and where two courts below have sustained that,
I found no effective way that I could proceed, except by defending
the actions which they have taken.
This Court in United States against Barnow, which, involve
a prosecution for impersonating an officer, a cognate question,
said that one of the purposes of such a statute is to maintain
the general good repute and dignify of the Service itself.

52
i

1

And this is essentially an argument which I made some­

2

what against the advice of some of my associates in the O'Brien

3

case, where I contended that it was within the power of Congress

4

under the necessary and proper clause in connection with the

5

power given to raise and defend armies, to protect the dignity

0

of the Selective Service process by making it a crime to burn

7

draft cards.

8

I did that because I found it somewhat difficult myself ;

9

to find that draft cards themselves were of very great importance

10

in the process„
The Court took the latter ground in its opinion and

11

12

thus the O'Brien case is not a decision on that point, but 1 think

13

that the decision reached is very close to the one which is

14

involved here.
So, our position would be that the criminal code pro­

15
56

vision is constitutional and that the defendant clearly came

57

within it and. was properly found by the jury to have come within

58

it.

So we come to the exemption in 10 U. S„ Code 772 ..£) .

59

Our contention is that the petitioner was not by any

20

reasonable stretch of the interpretation of the words in that

21

statute an actor in a theatrical or motion picture production.

22

Now obviously it was not a motion picture, so you can

23

throw that out.

cal production.

25

So you have to make him an actor in a theatri­

Now originally this statute — we have spelled out the.
history in cur brief *

The statute prohibited any person from

1

wearing the•uniform in any playhouse or theater or in moving

2

picture films.

It was codified, I think, in 1954 and the Sponsor
:

3

emphasised that no substantive change was intended.

The object it;

4

' '!
was to make it plain that television performances would be cover#

5

which might not come within playhouse or theaters.

'■

i

6

But the intention of Congress that is .manifest in. the

7

original language and in the revision, and that is that it is cor.

8

fined to situations where the make-believe role of the person

9

wearing a uniform is clear from the: setting.

Thus, it seems to

10

me that Dr. Strangelove or the Caine Mutiny come within it,

u

because everybody knows that that is a .simulation.

12

mean that a performance must be given in a building.

13

be an outdoor theater, could be an area set aside for it.

14

It doesn’t
It could

It means only that the performance wherever given mus'.:

15

preserve some of the traditional characteristics of the dramatic:

16

presentation,

17

and an audience comprised of events which they observed,are

18

portrayed and not real.

19
20
2!

23

■

such a,3 the defined area set apart for the actors

|

The skit here was not a theatrical production in any
reasonable meaning of the term.

It was intermittent events in a

demonstration in the street in front of an induction

station,

which also included picketing and distributing leaflets.

Pedes­

trians and motorists who either stopped or passed by the demon:

24

stration could •reasonably believe that the petitioner was, in
'

fit p*

dO

fact, a soldier as he was wearing distinctive parts of the unifoi-r

54

1

was intended to convey.

2

The petitionerE s conduct"here has all the elements of

3

picketing and no real similarity to the: theatrical production

4

which Congress contemplated.

5

that a person, would be entitled without authority to wear the

&

uniform of the Army merely because he was picketing.

7

to bring the petitioner's

8

language is pressing that language to its dryly logical extreme

9

And no one would suggest, X bexievei

To seek

action here within the statutory-

Or to use another passage from Holmes,

of being led

10

by a technical definition to apply a certain name and then to

11

deduce consequences which have no relation to the grounds on

12

which the name was applied.

v

Q

13

14

What you are really saying, then, is that in this:

act it was a question of law and not a question of fact?
A

15

Yes, Mr. Justice, and because of that we, since

IS

we think that as a matter of law that what he did does not come

17

within the exemption in the statute, the qualification

18

exemption about tending to discredit the Armed Forces is irrele­

19

vant .

20

on that

This is a little like a, for example, the Lopes case

2'i

which the defense of entrapment and the contention was made that

22

the charge about entrapment was not quite right, and the Court

23

leld that it was not necessary to decide that because it was a

24

natter of law.

25

antitied to any charge with respect to entrapment.

There wasn't any entrapment and he was not

55

3

We would contend here that the defendant was not enfcit-- .

2

led to any charge with respect to the. defense of actor in. a

q

theatrical production and, therefore, the question of discredit

**r

4 becomes irrelevant.
5

I would be prepared myself to defend the discredit excej:

6

tion to the exception to the statute if it was necessary, althouc

7

I agree it is getting very close to the line, but on grounds

8

similar to those which were involved in the O’Brien case with

9

respect to draft card analogy is the copyright law.
After all, the uniform is the uniform of the United

10

!

11

States and the United States is entitled to have some control v/:

12

the way in which it is used, but as 1 contended, the petitioner

13

does not come within the exception in any of the exemption;

14

any event.
All that is happening .hare was that the petitioner

15
16

*n

received the benefit of the defense, to which he was not entitled!.

17

Q

Was there any evidence in the record as to why

18

he wore the uniform?

19

Q

Does not his own statement suggest the answer to

20

that?

The petitioner's own statement was that he was doing it tc-

21

exoress his views on the war in Vietnam?
A

22

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

It was part of a demonstra­

23

tion.

24

outside and made a speech against the war in Vietnam, wearing hi,...-,

25

There is no doubt about that, and had he simply stood

uniform, I cannot see any basis upon which the fact, that he was

56

1

making a speech would entitle him to exemption from the statuto

2

which makes it an offense to wear the uniform of the United State
:

•r*

O

without authority.

4
5

Q

rectly, do you remember?

6
?

What did he say as to why he was doing it, indi­

A

The Court said — this is page 337 of the tran­

script —"Was the portrayal without reference to the fact you

8 had on full uniform calculated to discredit the Array or the
9

Armed Forces?"

10

"THE WITNESS:.

I think the uniform shows disapproval and

1!

my intention was to show my disapproval of the actions of the

52

Army *"

13

Q

14

rehearsed this skit?

15

A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Q

With the water pistol?

There is evidence in the record, I think, that he

There is some evidence that they rehearsed this

skit, if you can call it a skit.

20

The Jitney Players, I suppose.

Oh, yes, yes.

I don’t know

What we have put into our brief

Zl

essentially is a separate place for the players and circumstances

22

under which it is evident that, it is a simulation and not actual

fact.

5

A

That is the important part.

6
7

No, but whether the person was or was not a member,

There was nothing here

to indicate that he was not a member of the Armed Forces.

That's right, and whereas there would be if there

!3

A

Yes, if there was some kind of an indication that

it was a play.
Q

But he wouldn't have to make a statement that "I am

not a member of the Armed Forces."
A

That would have helped in this case, but indeed

14

if he had had a sign on his back "Not a member of the Army,"

15

that might have made it enough so that the jacket was not a dis­

16

tinctive part of the uniform.

I don't know.

17

We are very close to the line in each case.

18

Q

Even though they called it a protest, you are
-

19
20

really getting a pretty close line.
A

Yes.

Of course, that is part of the problem.

The

2!

Government tries to protect itself in various ways and then what-'

22

ever you do is either speech or is symbolic speech, and the first

23

Amendment you completely engulfed it, and the Government's powers,

24

are sharply restricted,.

25

Now obviously there is a line, a very important line

59

(

3

and a difficult line, but it is perfectly plain, it seems to sio,

«ii*.

that this protest could be made and could be made without inter­

«a»

ference at that place at that time.

4

The problem was the making it in the way in which it ras

5

made regardless of the place and the time, including the wearing 1

6

of the uniform, which Congress for more than 50 years has made

7

an offense when not authorized.
Well, our first submission is that the Court should

8
.

9

dismiss this petition as having been granted without jurisdiction!
.

10

If we are not successful on that, and I hope that we will be,
;

11

because I am greatly troubled by the unopen-ended situation in

12

which we now are, that the decision below on the merits mould

13

be affirmed.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

■

19

MR. BERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it. please the Court:

20

I would make one last point, to the Court.

We have

21

failed, at least in our opinion, to find any compelling interest

22

suggested by the Government for the enforcement, of that statute«

23

The Government acknowledges by the testimony that it has read

24

that the uniform itself was symbolic of speech.

25

We submit again that absent any compelling interest

60

1

regulate that action, the impingement on the freedom of

2

expression, the symbolic acts that the petitioner took part in,

3

was that sort of inpingement is not allowable until the holding

4

of the O'Brien case.

5

Q

6

*

I did not understand the Solicitor General., to con­

cede that wearing of this apparel was symbolic speech.

He said

7 that each time that these problems are raised in Court, he is
8

met with the argument that' this is symbolic speech.
|

9

A

If I misunderstood his argument, I believe that

10

the facts still remain that Schacht testified that he meant the

II

uniform as showing discredit or' criticism of the United States.

12

Q

So his intention, then, is not in dispute?

13

A

No, s ir „

14

Q

You have not resting wholly on this constitutional

the problems of construction of the statute was applied.
