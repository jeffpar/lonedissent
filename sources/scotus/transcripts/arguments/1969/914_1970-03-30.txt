ARGUMENT OF WHITNEY NORTH SEYMOUR

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

Numbers 914,915/316,917,

MR. SEYMOUR:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I am going to open for the appellants on our side.

10

I represent the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company under the

11

first mortgage bonds.

12

represents the Bondholders' Committee and he will be followed

13

by Mr. Auerbach who represents the Trustee.

14

on I will explain the division of argument.

15

I will be followed by Mr. Migdal who

A little later

The bonds outstanding of this railroad consist of

16

$76 million of first mortgage bonds with about $24 million

17

of accrued interest and $53 million of second mortgage bonds.

18

The Harlem River Divisional bond will be paid off, so there

19

is only the permanent two classes missing.

20

The Court, already has some familiarity with these

21

matters in the Perm Central Merger Case.

22

of the Commission, which I will have occasion to refer to,

23

was before the Court at the time it decided the Penn Central

24

Merger Case.

25

The Inclusion Report

The New Haven filed a petition for reorganisation

in the Connecticut District Court in 1961, and that reorganisa­

z

tion has continued since.

of the reorganisation from the beginning and continued

4

after his appointment to the Court of Appeals.

5

Judge Robert Anderson was in charge
to be

It is a somewhat unusual type of reorganization in

6

that from the very beginning, because the railroad had been

7

running deficit since at lea3t 19536, it was apparent that the

8

only way to keep the railroad running was to have some kind of

9

a merger or a sale: to another railroad in existence.

to

During the time of reorganization, that is, from

11

1961 through 1968 (at which time the Penn Central took over the

12

New Haven and paid over the consideration, subject to review of

13

the problem of price), the reorganization had accumulated some

14

§65 million of charges and claims ahead of the bonds as a

15

result of reorganization expenses, borrowings and so on.

18

This process continued, I think there is no dispute,

17

because of the determination on the part of the judge, the

18

trustees, the trustees' counsel, and the Commission to keep

19

the railroad running and a proper feeling on the part of Judge

20

Anderson and the others that New England required the continu­

21

It is clear, I think, that from the very beginning
the trustees were seeking to find a railroad with which there
might be a merger of the New Haven or an acquisition of the

4

New Haven and that, from the very beginning,, while this search

£

went on, there was no prospect chat the road could have been

8

abandoned or liquidated, because of the concern of everyone

7

to keep it running»

In 1361 the trustees approached the Pennsylvania
and the New York Central on behalf of New Haven to see if they

10

were interested in some acquisition»

11

or acquisition»

They are

10

set forth in our briefs on Page 15 from Judge Weinfeld’s later

11

dissenting opinion.

12

While the matter was pending before the Three-Judge

13

Court, the Commission submitted the purchase agreement to the

14

Reorganization Court as Step 1 in the plan of reorganization.

IS

In April, 1968 the Court appointed a former judge of

16

the Court of Appeals of New York, Judge John Van Voorhis, as a

17

Special Master to consider the problems arising out of the Grand

18

Central Terminal property.

19

Let me just say a word about that,-although Mr. Migdal

20

is going to carry the argument on the point on the matter that

21

is still open. Just after the turn of the century, the railroads

22

using Grand Central Terminal came down a great open ditch which

23

is now Park Avenue, and that seemed a waste of valuable property,

24

In the early part of the century, it was bridged over to create

25

Park Avenue.

As a result of that and -the agreements between the

Central and the Hew Haven» a number of the principal hotels,

of which we have all too few left in Mew York, were built;

nature of that interest and its value.

and arrived at a figure of $13 million as the figure which
should be allowed,,
That was evidently too low, and Judge Van Voorhis was

12

asked to report his views about the legal relationships.

13

upheld the view teat there was a partnership interest in connec­

14

tion with the Grand Central properties.

15

He

Ultimately, as I will show Your Honors, in the Remand

18

Report the original allowance of $13 million was advanced to

17

$28 million, so teat under the present position of the Commission,

18

Mew Haven is entitled to $23 million for its interest.

18

no dispute that the value of the property is $227 millions

20

So Penn Central has acquired a very valuable property for a

21

very small amount,

Q

There is

Was Judge Van Voorhis appointed Special Master

for the purpose only of considering this aspect of the problem?
A

Yes, because of his background in the Court of

Appeals, he was thought to be a great expert in the Mew York
8

1
2

property problems.
Q

And his jurisdiction was confined only to that?

3

A

That is correct.

4

Q

Has he retired from the Hew York Court of

8

A

Yes.

7

The Reorganisation Court like the Three-Judge Court

.

5

Appeals?
He is practicing law in Hew York.

8

concluded that the allowance by the Commission was inadequate,

9

that they had undervalued the property.

10

And it, too, remanded

to the Commission.

11

The Three-Judge Court thought that the amount the

12

Commission should increase its determination by was $45 to $50

1.3

million.

14

thought it should be $33 to $55 million.

15

Judge Anderson’s spread was a little wider.

He

The Commission proceeded to hold expedited hearings,

IS

and it made its remand report on November 25, 19^8.

17

one which these appellants attack here, so I will be talking

18

about some phases of that a little later on.

19

This is the

The Commission was sustained on some matters by the

20

courts later on.

21

What we are going to talk about on our side are those tilings

22

where the Commission was sustained by division among the judges

23

and those things where the Commission was sustained, but we

24

think the court was throng in sustaining it.

25

I don’t think 1 need to take any time on that.

The effect of the decision on remand was — starting

9

I

with the liquidation value of a $128.9 million which the

2

Commission had found on its original inclusion order and increas­

,

o

ing that to $162„7 million and then immediately retreating by a

4

series of major deductions from that amount —- the most signifi­

5

cant, and those to which 13m going to address myself, being two

8

totaling $22 million.

7

and the other a so-called "bulk sale".

8

8

One is a so-called ”abandonment delay"

In both these cases our position is that Judge Ander­
son and Judge Weinfeld who dissented below were correct in their

10

view -that these discounts were unjustified and that Judge

11

Friendly and Judge Levitt were wrong in concluding that they

12

could be justified.

13

the Reorganization Court in these matters.

14

And so we shall ask Your Honors to follow

A word or two about what they were:

The first dis­

15

count, the "abandonment delay" discount was in the substanial

16

figure of $15,386,00.

M

beginning in 1967 the New Haven would have had to start an

18

abandonment proceeding.

19

year the New Haven would have been practically at a standstill.

20

And although the loses for that year were already charged against

21

the New Haven, the Commission could properly charge it again for

22

up to an additional sum of $15,386,000.

23

And this was based upon the theory that

That would have taken a year.

In that

The "bulk sale" discount was a discount of about

24

$6 million.

The Commission held that it could require that the

25

New Haven’s property be sold in bulk and at a discount, because
10

i

it had the power to condition the abandonment certificate on a

2

sale in bulk — this abandonment certificate which it thought wo

3

have to be sought but which was never sought and never could

4

have been obtained could be conditioned on this "bulk sale"

5

discount.

3

And that was the theory on which the Commission went.
They made a few adjustments upward in their remand

7

report, including an additional sum on the Grand Central Terminal

'3

which I have already referred to.

9

whole operation of finding liquidation value of $162 million and

But the net result of their

10

then making these large deductions was to arri%re at a figure

11

of $140.6 to which it added $5 million additional, arriving at

12

a total figure of $145.6 million.

13

that the consideration for that which was largely in stock was

14

worth that amount and, therefore, if would approve the acquisi­

15

tion at that price.

And then it proceeded to find

16

Now, taking the figure that the Commission arrived at

17

that 1 have just mentionned — just so you have a kind of guide

18

to what it did — taking the price of Penn Central stock involved

19

in the consideration in December, 1968, which is the date of the

20

Commission5s remand report, the first mortgage bondholders

21

would have received 24£ on the capital on the dollar and 18C

22

on the dollar if interest is included.

23

You will see at once, of course, that the expectations

24

of the reviewing courts, the Three-Judge Court that $45 to $50

25

million would be cdded and of the Reorganisation Court that $33
11

1

to $55 million would be added as a result of reconsideration,

2

fell far short of achievement.

♦**>
Judge Anderson, when the problem of the remand report
4
&

came before him, approved -the immediate transfer of the property
of the New Haven to the Penn Central, so that the property would

6

be acquired before the end of the year, having previously ruled

i

that unless there was a transaction before the end of the year,

8

the trains would stop running on Januaryl, 1969, because the

9

erosion would then have gone beyond any possible constitutional

10

limit.

n

So the transfer took place, and from that time on —

12

This was-before, Your Honors, there was an effort to stop the

13

transfer.

14

proceeded, leaving the question of price open.

15

The courts below denied a stay, and so the transfer

Now, the state of the conflict between the courts

16

below is that as to this "abandonment delay" discount, Judge

17

Anderson and Judge Weinfeld thought it was entirely unjustified,

18

that it was illegal and erroneous, that it was not sustained

19

by substantial evidence.

20

Three-Judge Court affirmed (I submit, on the face of their

21

opinion, somewhat reluctantly) that it was —-

22

say it wasn’t sustained by substantial evidence, and they could

23

not say it was irrational, but they did sustain it.

24
25

Q

Judge Friendly and Judge levitt in the

They could not

Did Judge Anderson’s opinion precede the Three-

Judge Court opinion?

12

1

A

Yes .

2

Q

By what

kind of an interval?

3

A

A very,

very short time, six

4

weeks.

So it was

before the Three-Judge Court.

5

The division between the courts is the same on bulk

6

sale, the same on the Harlem River and Oak Point yards which

7

Mr. Migdal is going to talk about, and then on certain adjust­

8

ments .

9

And then there were some matters on which the courts

10

both disagreed with the position of the appellants here.

11

are going to present some of those points on argument and some

12

on brief.

13

matter of the Harlem River Yard, and the matter of the questions

14

on the Grand Central Terminal, and on the valuation of the stock.

15

And then we will submit, some of the points on the briefs,

*6

because there obviously is not time to cover all these points.

17

We

Mr. Migdal will present, following my argument, the

We submit that Judge Anderson and Judge Weinfeld

18

were clearly right, that the abandonment delay was, as Judge

19

Anderson said, dragged in by the heels for the purpose of

20

reducing the liquidation value with which both courts had former­

21

ly held the bondholders were entitled.

22

dispute here, that liquidation value is the proper standard.

23

There is not any real

The deduction of $16 million on liquidation value as

24

found by the Commission was more than a departure in the interest

25

of flexibility, or as the Commission said, a matter of

13

1

refinement or a matter of pricing out.

z

the whole concept of using liquidation value as the standard.

3

And there was no justification for it.

4

was perfectly clear that no application to abandon and liquidate

S

ttfould be granted.

6

The Commission thought that was clear.

1

It really subverted

From the beginning it

The Three-Judge Court thought that was clear.

It is perfectly evident from the whole course of these

8

proceedings that no such application would have been granted.

9

And the requirement that that hypothetical application should

10

be made, that these charges, in addition to the loses for 1967,

1?

should be piled on just to reduce the amount that Penn Central

'«2

had to pay for these properties seams to us most unjust and

13

inequitable, as Judge Anderson and Judge Weinfeld viewed it.

14

And I submit that that decision should be reversed.

15

Now, there are details of that which are in the briefs,

16

Q

Excuse me, Mr. Seymour.

Suppose -the court, on

17

that theory, pursuant to the order of the point, might have said

18

since it can never be abandoned, we will just spread this

19

abandonment delay indefinitely?

20

A

Well, if the Commission is permitted to say it

21

would take one year, then they could say it would take two

22

years, and they could make an allowance for that.

23

that it opens an area of perfectly arbitrary conduct and decision

24

which the court should not permit.

25

correctly, the Commission could then spread it over a period of
14

And I submit

If I understood Your Honor

1

time, so that no liquidation value would be paid.

2

that erosion had reached the outer limits, and no further

S

erosion was fairly and properly to be applied,

Q

4

And I submit

1 am not sure I quite got your point on charging

5

Mextf Haven 'with the losses for the year and then, I think as you

6

put it, superimposing the one-year abandonment delay on top

7

of that hypothetical loss,
A

8
9

Well, the New Haven was running in the year 1967,

and the Hew Haven had to absorb the losses for 1967.

10

Q

But this was a real loss, not a hypothetical one.

11

A

That is right.

It had to absorb those losses.

12

Those eroded the values available for the bondholders to the

13

extent of those losses, because they were paid off in some

14

fashion —
Now, in addition to that loss, what the Commission has

15
16

done is to put $16 million on top of that to deduct from the

17

value of the assets remaining, and, therefore, has piled it on

18

top of the loss, I submit.

I

How there are some details of that piling on which

But they have made up this

They have added on preservation costs which are not

15

sustained, we think, by the record.

1

Then they have added on

2

taxes which, after all, would not have been added to if some

3

of the property was disposed of in a reasonable time.

.

4

So that if you came to look at whether or not there

3

was substantial evidence to sustain their conclusion as to the

0

amount of this loss, you would find that it was not sustained.

7

But, I prefer to grapple with it on the basis that as

8

a matter of lav?, it was improper for the Commission to apply this

2

hypothetical loss to reduce the minimum value, the liquidation

14

the property be sold in bulk,

16

The Commission held that they had

And thus they arrived at the

In the Three-Judge Court, Judge Friendly thought there

17

was the gravest constitutional doubt about the ability of the

18

Commission to condition an abandonment (to which they were

19

constitutionally entitled as a losing railroad) upon a sale in

20

bulk. And, therefore, he thought

21

So, he sustained the decision of the Commission on a wholly

22

different ground than the Commission had taken.

23
24
25

that went beyond their power.

He sustained

it on the ground that he found evidence in the record by a
witness named Simon that if the property was sold, a bulk buyer
would have many risks on which he would want to get a discount.

16

But, that was not the basis on which the discount

1

2

was allowed by the Commission.

3

examined, it is perfectly apparent that he was talking about

4

that a court in reorganisation, with its own independent

MR. MIGDAL:

Thank you, Mr. Seymour.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
While the Commission has acknowledged that liquidation

value was the standard that should be applied with respect to

20

the property of the New Haven, it has failed in several instance:

21

to give that liquidation value because it has not understood that

when you go to find liquidation value, what you must find is

23

what the liquidator of that property would receive if he sold

it in the method that was best suited to his disposition.

question of whether there would or would not be rail service

available to the industrial users of those two yards in the

the point.
Now, there isn't any question that the two values

And, no

sensible liquidator would have liquidated in that way.
And, it was for that reason that Judge Weinfeld and

4
5

vTudge Anderson both said that it was simply impermissible to

8

permit the assumption — the basis here, liquidation — to

7

assume that there would be no service available.

8

They were aware that New York City had dealt with

that.

And, therefore, there never seemed to Judge Anderson

the possibility that a liquidator would tear up the track and,

in that way, make it impossible to realize the best value he

May I ask you an overall question?

Yes, Your Honor.

6

Q

Supposing you prevail, or substantially prevail

7

here, what is the consequence?

8

Commission?

19

A

Is there a remand to the

I think, Your Honor, on this point, there is no

20

remand to the Commission, because I think that the record has

2

been perfectly clear that if you found that these yards —

22

23
24
25

There is one question, however, that does raise a
problem with respect to the remand.
In the valuation, when you consider the possibility
that the mile and a half of track would be torn up, you then
2

19

have to consider that, on the liquidation hypothesis, that

2

track would continue even if the Mew Haven, for example, had

3

to give that track to New York, in order to make sure that the

4

track would continue.

5

which is about $500,000, would have to be subtracted from the

6

$22»5 million, because then you would have valued it twice»

7

Then the value of the right-of-way,

However, Judge Anderson clearly thought that -there

8

was no danger that New York City would pay a fair price for that

9

right-of-way in order to preserve the service to the Hunt's

m

Point yards.

And, therefore, he did not make that deduction.

1?

And we submit that that is perfectly plain and correct.

12

does not need to be a remand again to value that small piece

13

of right-of-way which, at worst, would have been donated to

14

New York City or to the developers of the Oak Point and Harlem

15

River yards.

There

21

Then it runs on another mile until it meets the spur

In a certain sense, this unwillingness to permit the

22

Mew Haven its real liquidation value, while always asserting

23

that liquidation value is what is being granted —

24

Commission's treatment of the Grand Central Terminal is another

25

case in point.

The

For there the Mew Haven enjoys the right, or
22

1

enjoyed the right until the closing* of bringing its trains

2

into the station»

3

back to the 1840' s, and it had it partly by virtue of agreements

4

which it made with the Central»

5

It had this partly by charters which went

Now* that right permitted the New Haven to operate its

6

trains into the station and out of all the Terminal properties.

7

Here we are not talking simply about the station income itself.

8

We are talking about all of the Park Avenue properties and all

9

of their income.
By agreement

10

these were being put into the Terminal

11

account* and all of the expenses were coming out of the Terminal

12

account to pay the expenses of both railroads. Central and the

13

New Haven, in the station.
Now, obviously this income grew as the real estate

14

15

developed, and it became more profitable.

16

pretty remote part of New York City, but that changed in time.

17

And the result of that was that, as the income increased, the

18

difference between the actual expenses and the incoxne from

19

the properties began to disappear.

3

what the division of the excess income should be between the

parties.

Now

when that happened,

So, the question then arose as to

5

way in which I have divided it for this discussion.

7

hope that all that is clear,
Q

10

And I

Before you proceed, am I correct in my understand­

ing that there is now no issue remaining as to the excess
income? •

ii

A

That is correct, Your Honor,

12

Q

The issue goes to the $5,6 million or the value

13
14

of that income?
A

That is correct, Your Honor,

And yet it is

15

extremely important to understand how the issue with respect

16

to the excess income was settled.

17

In the first instance, Central had denied that the

18

New Haven had any right; in the income that those properties

IS

produced in the event that the New Haven stopped operation.

20

As a result of that, in the negotiations between the Trustee

21

and Penn Central, no value was allowed for that.,

22

argue that that was all wrong.

23

nature of the New Haven’s interest had been litigated in the

24

New York Courts,

and the Court of Appeals had said that the New Haven was, in

effect, an equal partner with the Central in the management of

2

those properties and treated them as joint venturers»

3

The Commission, however, on the first round, gave

4

us this small value of $13 million because it considered, in

5

the first place, that there was a great question as to whether

6

it would survive, in spite of the rule in the Biltxnore case

7

as to whether we had a real interest»

10

use in the station) and $5 million (which was a certain

11

nuisance value attributable to the claim), and it split the

'12

difference and came out with $13 million»

13

It was important that Judge Van Voorhis was named to

14

look into the question, because the result of his decision was

15

to declare that the New Haven Railroad was, in fact, and equal

16

partner — that it was an equal partner in an indefeasible way.

17

And, therefore, the New Haven's interest in that excess income,

18

the profits from the operations, had to be fully valued, and

IS

we had to be fully paid»

20

that we were an equal partner and that that interest was, in

21

fact, indefeasible is very important for the purpose of under­

22

standing v?hat ought to have happened to the $5,6 million.

23

And

then to say that his declaration

What we had (as Penn Central's witnesses themselves

24

testify) was the greatest bargain in history.

25

to come into that terminal with our trains, and because the
25

We had a right

!
£.

Terminal income was so great, we didn't have to pay for it.
There fores, the question is why now, when that valuable

3

interest is turned over to Penn Central (so that Penn Central

4

can perform the service that we formerly performed and perform

5

it without cost, because it is utilising the same income),

6

Penn Central should not be required to pay for it.

7

I must say that if you read Judge Friendly’s opinion

8

on this point, you will see on the first round of review that

9

essentially there was only one ground.

In spite of all the

10

grounds that are finally talked about, there is only one ground

11

that really determined his decision.

12

if the New Haven stopped operating, whether anybody would acquire

13

our right — whether anybody would be interested in doing that —*

14

or whether it was so speculative that somebody would acquire

15

that right that we ought not to be paid for it.

16
17

18

Q

It would appear —

And that was his view that

At least your first answer

is that the Penn Central did acquire your right,
A

Yes, Your Honor.

But it was inevitable that

19

somebody would acquire it, because if nobody would acquire it,

26

then precisely what the Chief Justice adverted to when he spoke

21

to Mr. Seymour would have occurred.

22

until we would have been drained of all equity.

23

This would have gone on

On the one hand, we were not permitted to stop the

24

operations, because we were bound to the public interest.

25

on the other hand, it was conceived by Judge Friendly that there

perform it for its own people.

Now, that, I submit, was simply

Now, I am not sure I understand -chat

You

with your train?

7

A

That is right, Your Honor.

Q

Well, I had understood that the rationale was

combination acquired it, their bargaining power would be such

that they wouldn't pay anything for it.

16

That was one of the statements made at one point in the case,

17

and X think that I must clearly meet it.

18

that it was the fundamental one.

19

was that it was too speculative that, the states would acquire it

20

and, therefore, too speculative to value that right.

Though X don't think

1 think the fundamental point

2!

Mow, X think that if you look at Judge Friendly's

22

opinion, you will note that he says that it was possible to

conceive of the possibility that the service would only be

acquired as far as Woodlawn.

25

4

And, I submit that that simply was an impractical

solution.
Judge Friendly should have noticed from the very

beginning, and the Commission should have recognised from the

7

very beginning, that there was no possibility that that service

8

would cease.

And the market value on that date

some $33 million.
There was some argument that it was reasonable to value

12

the shares as of the closing date.

Because after all that is

13

when we gave our property up, and that is when we received the

14

property back.

But then the shares had a value of $60 million.

15

That was in December of *68?

16

A

That was in December of ’68.

17

So what you have left is either a gap of $33 million

or a gap of $23 million, but you have a very substantial gap.

And both courts recognized that that wouldn't work.

Your Honor, in the first place, there are

9

there is a procedure by which Penn. Central, as in this case in

like to issue shares in order to meet this obligation.
The Commission in this case did authorize Perm Central

12
13

to issue the 950,000 shares and could have authorized the

14

issuance of more than 950,000 shares inorder to see that what the

24
25

Penn Central, itself, acknowledges that it

is a very cyclical, situation.

It talks about the difficulties

of starting up the merger and one thing and another.
36

i

But that, it seems to us, had nothing to do with this

2

case.

3

it was nothing but a sale, the equivalent of what we gave up.

4

In this case we were entitled to be paid.

For, in fact,

I have been handed, this morning, a chart which I am

5

afraid I am unable to understand, but which I understand will

6

be used in connection with an argument on this stock point.

7

Whereas, throughout, we have said that what the

8

Commission should do is to give us the additional shares, so

S

that it would make up the $83 million.

Because there was never

10

any need to guess as to what the market price would be on the

fi

date of closing.

12

of closing would be in 1970, that at that time the shares

13

would pay between $75 and $100.

There was a guess made by Kirk that the date

We didn't close in 1970; we closed at the end of 1968.

The price was not then $87.50? it never reached $87.50.

19

price then was $63 and three-eighths.

20

unnecessary, because history would have shown just what the

21

price had to be. It was there that the Commission went wrong.

The

All these guesses were

22

Judge Weinfeld has never yet accepted that and has

23

said that it ought to be remanded to the Commission, so that

24

the Commission can provide the cash equivalent.

25

We have tried not to interfere with the underwriting
37

1

formula farther than we had to in order to avoid that remand,

2

because this proceeding has gone on now for some nine years.

3

The underwriting, in a certain sense ( if some small correc­

4

tions are made to it) , does insure that eventually we will

5

receive $83 million.
We have had, however, in effect, just a part payment.

6
7

That part payment is either $60 million or $50 million of the

3

$83.1, and the balance is still to come.

3

creditors, in effect, for the rest.

We are general

We have not even a pur­

10

chase money mortgage with respect to that balance.

And nobody

!1

would have transferred all his real estate here for a part pay­

12

ment without taking back, at least, a purchase money mortgage.
The underwriting provides us no security that that

13
14

payment will ever be made, and that, we say, is one of its

15

vices.

!6

A second vice that we assign to the underwriting

17

formula is this.

18

respect either to the $23 or $33miliions of consideration that

13

we didn't receive, so we have said that we ought to be paid

20

interest on that.

22

prime rate, and we submit that that is the very least that

There is one other deficiency in the undewriting.

provided as a part of that underwriting formula that if Penn

looked for interest up to the point where we could liquidate

up to the end of 1978.

Our answer to that is that -the underwriting formula

Your Honor, this brings me to the last point that I

IS
12

would like to discuss and that is the terrible unfairness of

13

the loan loss formula and the land which it has worked in this

14

case.

15

The loan loss formula, we submit, was simply a formula

16

by v/hic'n the erosion was permitted to continue.

17

available to the New Haven cash so that it could continue to

18

operate at a deficit, not paying its taxes, not paying its per

19

diem charges, the formula was not a formula for the relief of the

20

New Haven? it was a formula which imposed further losses upon

21

the New Haven. And, inevitably, for as long as we took the money

22

we had to run the railroad, and we had to lose money.

23

By making

Now, when this matter was before the Court the last

24

time, the notion was that we were only going to have a very

25

small loss, because the formula would take care of all of the
40

1

New Haven’s losses, and it was predicted that those losses

2

would be small.

scale,

4

first year losses and then 50 per cent and 35 per cent that

5

Mr, Justice Douglas wrote about in his dissent.

You will recall that it was in a descending

Penn Central was to contribute a 100 per cant of the

6

Now, what has happened is that we did close in the

7

first year.

And having closed in the first year, the losses

8

that were contributed under the Commission formula was only

9

$5 million.

But the Commission knew one month before it ordered

10

the closing, in November of 1968 when it handed down the

11

remand report, that its guess that those losses would be small

12

and that the $5 million would therefore cover just about all

!3

of the Hew Haven’s losses — they knew then that that was untrue,

14

that the losses were much, much greater.
Nevertheless, in spite of our urging, they persisted

15
16

in saying that that was as far as they would go,

I submit that

17

if the Commission was right in saying that it was fair for

18

Penn Central to bear a 100 per cent of the first-year losses,

19

it should not have withdrawn from that at the point when it

20

found that the losses were larger than they had anticipated.

21

Because it was certainly unfair in the circumstances of this

22

case where the bondholders were required to absorb $70 million

23

of losses,

24

million more than the total value of the 950,000 shares we

25

got.

And I submit to you that the $70 million was $10

We were being eliminated; we were being obliterated here.
41

1

And then to say that the 100 per cent of the losses

'
2

should be altered in the last year and limited to that $5

3

million, imposing $6 million on the Mew Haven, that was

4

improper.

The issue is simple in one respect.

18

Let me address myself just very briefly to each of

these points.

20

not to review valuation as such, the judge is to determine with

21

such additional evidence as he deems appropriate (this is not a

quote, but it is my reading of Ecker) whether the Commission, in

23

fact, did obey the statutory standards.

plan for the New Haven Railroad and at the same time the fairness:

16

of the terms for the inclusion of that railroad into the newly-

17

merged Penn Central Railroad.
The reorganization plan was made possible, because of

18
19

the happenstance that, during the course of the New Haven

20

bankruptcy, Penn and New York Central applied for permission

21

to merge.

22

In this merger the New Haven trustees saw both a

23

threat and an opportunity as their counts were stated to the

24

Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit in 1967.

Penn Central in the view of the trustees afforded the only

Inclusion in

jS

practicable means for reorganization of the debtor that would

2

be consistent with the best interest of the public and to all

3

parties interested in the debtor's estate.

4

They quickly filed for inclusion in 1962» within 3

5

months after Penn and Central asked for permission to merge.
Now under decisions of this Court, the Commission had

In no reorganization has the process of valuation

It might have been possible to have reorganized a

It was not

explored in any depth by the Commission, since the study presen­

The valuation of the New Haven presented the Commissio:»

reason for that I will come to.

16

The

The initial hearings for the terms of New Haven’s

17

inclusion ware held in 1967 while the courts reviewed the legality

13

of the Perm Central merger. While the focus of these 1967

19

hearings was on an agreement entered into between the trustees

20

and Penn Central under which the New Haven properties and freight

21

operation would be transferred to Penn Central in return for

22

stocks, bonds, and cash and Penn Central’s assumption of certain

23

liabilities.

24

25

The Commission tested these agreed terms, first,

by considering the value of the properties.

FURTHER ARGUMENT OF LEONARD S, GOODMAN
MR, GOODMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe the

7

bondholder attack on the cost of the abandonment proceeding is,

8

in fact, a demand that Penn Central pay a larger share of the

9

pre-inclusion losses.

10

The Commission treated that claim as a matter separate

II

from -fhe valuation and did, in fact, cause Penn Central both

12

to lend $14 million to New Haven in the year 1968 and to pay

13

$5 million of New Haven's losses.

14

After December 31, 1968, all of the losses were

15

Penn Central8s from the New Haven operation.

16

we submit that Penn Central is not required to do more,

And, in fairness,

Mr. Goodman, for losses prior to when Penn Centra

19

all these losses you are talking about, how was the bondholders”

20

first claim to their liquidation value lowered or eroded away

21

by operating losses?

22

said that some $60 million value was eroded away as far as the

23

bondholders were concerned by losses which occurred prior to

24

the time of the transfer.

25

A

I gather from the argument that it is

In part the erosion occurred by the issuance of
62

i

trustee certificates, which took priority over their claims.

2
3

Q

But, I gather there were not $60 million worth

of trustee certificates.

4

A

Ho, there weren't.

3

Q

Well, how else then? Just by equipment wearing out

6

or something like that or depreciation?
A

7

Insofar as this record goes, it is an inflated

3

figure.

There is no erosion in the liquidation value anywhere

9

near comparable to $60 million or $70 million.
Q

10

Well, to the extent some of these expenses were

n

taken up with some kind of an arrestment which involved a prior

12

13

A

14

Were the trustees

The only reason that I raise the issue of

15

trustees certificates, is that some of these were issued to

16

Penn Central to cover the $14 million and —
Q

Those surely were subsequent to the bondholders

Yes.

Q

And I suppose postponement of real estate taxes?

A

Yes, this would also be prior to their lien.

22

23

again to mix real world concepts with this hypothetical liqui­

24

dation.

"The Bondholders will receive the

15

result of the discussion of specific points.

The Court by now understands, of course, that the New

for years, and it was a railroad not only with a passenger

deficit but with a freight deficit.

Constitution.

something like that.

Q

Would it be fair to say that this combination of

was made one of the conditions, is something compelled by the

public interest in the furtherance of the national transportation

system policy?

ation that there should be an allowance for abandonment delay.

20

It makes that very clear in a passage that occurs in its report

21

about Page 146 of that printed volume of the first Appendix.

22

Because the Commission's view was that if you assume

23

that there was going to be a liquidation of the New Haven —

24

and you have to assume that, if you are going to fix a liquida­

25

14

doesn’t make too much difference.

to be

18

finding in the abandonment delay is that, in addition to

19

taking 6 years to sell it, you are going to need another year

20

to get in the position to start selling it.
And if you look at it completely in the hypothetical

2i
22

frame, there is no doubt that they would have had to have had

23

the certificate, and there is no doubt they didn’t have one.

20'

the inclusion proceedings but largely in the interests of

21

increasing price.

22

That is what they were trying to do.

If you begin to look at this problem in terms of

23

who suffered most and you try to decide how this liquidation

24

hypothesis should be applied by appealing to sympathy instead

25'

of looking at the merits of the particular methods the courts

86

1

used, some other considerations then come into play which I

2

would be obliged to mention to the Court.

3

Whatever losses these people have suffered, Penn

4

Central is required to suffer these losses in the indefinite

'5

future.

And what is more, that is not something —

6

Q

Could they abandon some

A

There is no indication that the Commission is

3

going to allow them to abandon freight service, and nobody

knows what will happen on the passenger service.

As a matter

11

have not received

15

I thought that Penn Central agreed to undewrite

14

losses, a certain percentage of losses, a 100 percent the first

15

year on a declining scale?

16

A

That was; the Commission, yes —

17

Q

They agreed to that, didn't they?

18

Wow the

Commission lets them out from under that

19

A

No, Mr. Justice

20

Q

— or part of that?

21

A

They simply applied the same formula but to one

22

year.

23

years before they would be included, and there was a maximum

24

under the formula of $5 million.

25

You see, that formula was assumed that it would be 3

Q

I suppose you can get into a big argument about
87

1

that?

z

A

It;'s just a matter of judgment*

I think the

o

suggestion was left this morning that the Commission modified

4

its formula*

5

$5 million a year* and that is what the Pennsylvania paid for

6

'68.

It didn't really.

There was always a maximum of

7

Q

That was $5,.500,000.

That v?as pro-rated, for 196 8 ?

8

A

Yes, pro-rated over 11 months.

9

I think this —

The next think I should like to say

1C

something about is the so-called "bulk sale discount”, which

n

I think there has been some confusion about too.

n

That determination of the Commission does not assume

13

a bulk sale.

14

a method that the Commiesion used based on the testimony of an

15

expert witness — a method that the Commission used to value

16

the real property of the New Haven as of the valuation date,

17

on the assumption that that real property was going to be sold

18

piecemeal over 8 years.

IS

Commission amounted to.

20

It doesn't assume a bulk purchaser.

It is simply

That is all that determination of the

This witness, who was an experienced real estate

21

investor, testi feci that if he were going to value these 3,000

22

pieces of property that the New Haven had as of the valuation

23

date, he would go about it in a particular way.

24
25

And the way

he went about it was making some computations about the amount
of capital that would be involved in the venture.
88

1

He said 75% of mortgage capital at. 9%, 25% equity

a

capital at 15%.

3

cash flow on the proceeds , using tile same appraisals that the

4

New Haven people had made, and assuming a 6 year liquidation ■—

5

the same way the New Haven people: did — he arrived at a figure

8

which he thought represented the value of that mass of real

7

property as of the1 valuation date, the end of 1966.

8

9

tod by applying those rates of return to idle

Now the Commission took his testimony and did it a
little differently.

They took a weighted average and got 10.5%

io

which they applied, really, instead of the 6%.

it

issue about the bulk sale discount really comes down to is

12

simply a question of whether the Commission

13

the real properties of the New Haven for the purpose of determine

14

ing its valuation of the valuation date by 6%, as it did the

15

first time, or by 10.5 %,as it did the second time, on the

18

basis of this testimony.

17

Q

So what this

would have discounted

Mr. Cox, is it true that the 6% that was original!

18

set as a discount. —* was that intended to reflect just a value,

19

the translation of future value to present value?

That was what was called,! believe, Mr. Justice

White, a money discount.

economy or in real estate value or in not being able to sell

as soon as you thought or anything?

A

That is right.

Q

That's clear?

4

A

That I think is clear on the record, and we have

developed that in our brief.

6

difference between having the money now and having it 6 years

7

from now,

That was simply 6% to represent ths

8

Q

That was its present value?

9

A

That's right,

SO

Q

But now there have been introduced two other

11

things: 1) either risk of real estate values going down,

ia

particularly in connection with abandonment and 2) the power

13

of the Commission to require a sale in bulk,

14
!5

A

No, not in my view, Mr. Justice Stewart,

That

is the Chenery point, and I3d better say something about that.

16

Q

I think you perhaps had,

17

A

This judgment, as I think Mr, Goodman said,

18

about how to value the properties was essentially a business or

IS

an economic judgment.

20

that, we think the best method of determining liquidation value

21

of the real estate —- or a reasonable method ■— is to do it

2.2

in the way that Mr. Simon's testimony has demonstrated it

23
24
25

And what the Commission was saying was

could be done.
Now, the bondholders argued that, as a matter of lav/,-»
constitutional law they said — they were entitled to have
90

'I

liquidation value determined by a particular method.

In other

2

words, they said the only way you could do it under the

3

Constitution is to take these individual appraisals, put them

4

all together and maybe you can apply the 6% discount, but if

5

you do anything besides that, you have departed from a

8

Constitutional standard.
Now the Commission responded to that argument {and thau

7

8

is what all this discussion about what they could do in an

9

abandonment proceeding)

The Commission responded to that

10

argument by saying there is nothing in this broad-Constitutional

11

argument, because in some circumstances we could require you

n

to sell to a bulk purchaser who is going to continue the rail­

13

road operation.

3

I think the Commission may have given a dubious or

2

a more involved answer to this argument than it needed to have

given.

simply by saying that you may be entitled to liquidation value,

but we are entitled to determine liquidation value by any

Let me tell yoii how that was done, Mr. Justice

White.

e

They then had, as I understand it, 3,000 separate appraisals

9

made.

10

New Haven first broke the land up into 3,000 parcels.

And those appraisals did not take into account the

problem of market absorption or how long it would take to sell.
Q

11
12

They didn’t purport to include the factors that

the Commission had included.

13

A

That's right.

They purported to set a value if they were sold

I think even that witness admitted that that was an optimistic

And he said, "Wall, you obviously can not sell all these

I think it would take at least 6 years."

And, of course, my client said

Q

1

I take it that if you had experts that actually

testified, what the property would be worth if sold pursuant to

4td>

this liquidation plan over a period of 6 years, you might have

4

some problems with the ICC determination?

5

Yes, but you didn't have that, because these

This is all, and

I don’t believe it can

The only thing they had done as to certain specific

9
10

pieces of property — They had applied what, was called a "cats

11

and dogs discount" of $8 million as to certain particular

12

parcels.
Now the witness, Simon, took that into account.

13

He

14

said, even with that, he would use this method of valuing the

15

property — 'which produced the 10,5% discount the Commission

16

used.

17

But the "cats and dogs discount" was confined to

18

certain particular pieces of property which had known infirmities;

IS

at the time the appraisals were made.

20

to the future risks.

21

It really didn’t look

At the risk, perhaps, of appearing to be rather

22

disjointed in this presentation, I should now like to touch

23

briefly on some points that have come up in respect to other

24

aspects of the case, one of them being the situation of the

25

2 yards in the Bronx,
94

1

I hope the Court is clear that the question there

2

really comes down to an appraisal of the evidence over whether

3

some railroad, in the event of liquidation of the New Haven,

4

would serve these 2 New Haven yards in the Bronx.

S

2 yards that are in issue.

S

It is those

Now the Commission took an appraisal which was made

7

on the assumption that -the New Haven would abandon the service.

8

The bondholders say that the Commission was bound to take a

8

higher appraisal which the appraisers said would only apply if

10

you assumed that some railroad, other than the New Haven,

11

supplied the same service to New Haven.

12

So that, on the hearing it became an argument over

13

whether the Penn Central could voluntarily or could be compelled

14

to serve these 2 yards.

15

Q

I'm looking at a map on Page —■

16

A

Yes, I know the map.

17

20

I think that is the map

that shows the lines running —- shows 2 lines over on the left
that run down the Harlem River and a yellow line going across.
Q

Yes, and then it's got blue lines going down

to the Hell3s Gate Bridge.

21

A

Yes, yes.

22

Q

And it's got one going out the Bronx River in

23

kind of a -- well, I wouldn't know what color to call that.

24

What's that?

These 2 lines over on the left are old New York

Q

A

Yes„

division?

6

And the yellow line was a New York Central

7

branch which ran down to the former Port Morris Yard of the

8

New York Central and then into an interchange point with the
New Haven»

Any traffic which the New York Central moved to this

10

area was a part of these yards or to the Hunt's Point Market

II

was interchanged at that point.
Now the Commission heard this evidence and having

12
13

heard it found, on all the facts, that if the New Haven were

14

liquidated (which is the hypothesis we're considering), Penn

15

Central would not serve these yards and could not be compelled

18

to.

17

we think that planning was fully supported by substantial

18

evidence.

IS

And. the reasons that are set forth in our brief in length —

I just want to say one word about that, however, to

20

make one point clear.

21

that the Penn Central could be compelled —- if the New Haven

22

were liquidated — to serve that market operated by the city

23

of New York.

24

traffic is highly unprofitable.

25

The Reorganisation Court took the view

The Commission found to the contrary, because 'that

But even if it is assumed — and this is the point I
6

1

would like to make — that Perm Central might serve that Hunt's

2

Point vegetable market, or might be compelled to, it doesn't

3

follow that it would serve either of these other 2 yards.

4

evidence showed that an average of only about 13 cars a day

5

went to those yards to serve them.

e

7

somebody else tracks and facilities which would be extremely

e

expensive, in view of the fact that the traffic would not be

s

profitable anyway.

The

The Penn Central would

Furthermore, the evidence shows that it

«0

would incur very substantial operating costs for the purpose of

11

this small volume of traffic.

12

,

Now * as far as the suggestion that they could be

13

compelled to serve them, the Commission disposed of that by

14

examining the facts and saying that there was no evidence of any

IS

need for service to these 2 yards, or to the Hunt's Point Market

16

for that matter, which would justify requiring service in the

17

public interest.

18

make a contrary finding to require service.

IS

And, of course, the Commission would have to

So I think that looking at that whole situation, it is

20

quite clear that the Commission's determination there, which

21

depended upon evidence as to what the operating conditions were

22

and also involved the Commission's own judgment about what -the

23

transportation needs were, should clearly be sustained.

24
25

I may add that we point out in our brief that evidence
before the Commission —- that New Haven, itself, sold large
97

1

chunks of one of these yards at exactly the square foot price

2

that was in the appraisal -that, the Commission adopted, which was

c

50£ a square foot lower than the price in the appraisal that

4

the bondholders now say the Commission is required, as a matter

5

of law, to adopt,,

6

on this question, the Commission might have to have another look

7

at the whole question of valuation,

&

like to say something about this issue of stock, because 1

I should

10

think questions from the bench indicate that there is something

11

that should be, perhaps, said about it.

12

The Commission, in treating the stock issue, fixed an

13

inherent value for this stock that, was going to be delivered on

14

the closing date,

13

Q

What's that?

S6

A

That was a determination that the stock would

17

have that value in itself, even though it might not command a

18

pries on the stock market, as of a particular day, that was equal,

19

to that value*

20
21

Q

Well, how does a moneylender get that inherent

value out of a piece of paper?

22

A

Well, he has to keep it until he can get it.

He has to keep it?

They were going to put this

reason they were going to do that is because everyone knew that,

A

I'm simply saying that the Commission — I'm

#3

20
21
2.2

23
24
25

saying two things — I think the Commission, in a transaction
of this kind involving a reorganization of railroads, is entitled,
as long as it has substantial evidence to support it, to
determine a value of the stock that is inherent rather than a
value that is evidenced by current market quotations.

And that

that is so, even if it may be some time — depending upon —
99

\

Q

So you're saying that although you agreed at the

2

outset that, either under the Constitution or a statute, they

3

are entitled to liquidation value, that you car* satisfy that

standard by giving it to them anytime within 10 years?

So you’re saying, yes, the answer is yes, that

Now, of course, the courts below took care of this
problem —

16

Q

Well, do you think they could satisfy liquidation,

17

the liquidating Vc;Xue standard, by giving them money today which

18

will be worth a $145 million 10 years from now?

19

A

No, Mr. Justice White, money's different.

20

Q

Well, that is what you're saying with the stock —

21

we're going to give you some pieces of paper that within 10

22

years will be worth $33 million.

Well, they aren't rejecting payment.

If you gave

6

them $83 million in cash, do you think they would take that

7

rather than the stock?

8

A

I can't answer that.

9

Q

Well, you seem to though, by saying they wanted

n

A

All I can say is that they have indicated they

12.

want stock.

13

want more stock as opposed to bonds.

10

All I can say is —•

the stock.

And some of the bondholders have said that they

14

Q

Well, that isn’t ■—

15

A

Because the junior bondholders' only hope in

16

this thing is to have that stock go up in value, so that they

17

can gat something out of it.

18

Q

So, you are suggesting that what their claim

IS

ought to be here, really, is that not that they want more stock,

20

but they really ought to say that they want bonds which bears

21

a rate of interest.

22

A

If that’s what they really want, yes.

They have

23

never taken that position.

Payment, of this large amount of the

24

consideration in stock is something that has been in this plan

25

from the very beginning.

And sofar as I know, the bondholders
101

1

have never insisted that more of it should be paid in bonds»

2

Now, they have asked for cash, at times, to snake up

differences between the market value.

have been feasible? nobody could have raised the money to pay

You look at the

It's another matter when you're talking about

giving somebody liquidation value than giving inherent value.

A

Well, they get something that, 1 submit, is

And, of

5

course, any modifications in that underwriting would have to

go back to the Commission, because it involved this question

under Section 28.
Q

8

9

One more question —you have a little time left -■

is that I get the feeling (perhaps this isn’t a question)

10

throughout here that the Commission, faced with trying to imple­

ment the national transportation policy with two somewhat

12

As I understand it, there is a

Q

That’s where the litigation is, isn’t it?

17

A

I’m sorry, Mr. Justice.

Q

The real issue is between the bondholders who

19

claim a certain amount and the Penn Central who claims they are

20

not entitled to that amount.

And that's the litigation?

21

A

That’s the litigation.

22

I just wish to say to the Court that; on this question,

the free use of the Grand Central Terminal, that as we read the

In this opinion that we’re reviewing of the

found that the 950,000 shares with the underwriting was the

K’o.

That is exactly the posture.

That8s what, on the whole, you wanted, something

that is equivalent to $83 million now, isn't it?
A

Exactly, Your Honor, nothing more or less, as of

n

the closing date, and we would take it in any form which we

18

could get it.

19

I would like to say a word in connection to a question

20

that Mr. Justice Black asked.

And that related to the question

21

of who bore the burden here.

22

decided that we were supposed to get another $100 million.

23

that going to come out of the public's pocket, or is that going

24

to come out of Penn Central's pocket?

25

is quite simple.

Suppose that, in fact, the Court

108

And the answer

Is

to that

1
2

The Commission has the power to make up that $100
million simply in shares of Penn Central.

Now as that happens -

3

Q

Simply in what?

4

A

Simply by providing that. Penn Central pay the

5

difference in shares of Penn Central.

And if that happens —

6

Q

If Penn Central pays that much?

7

A

That's right.

That Penn Central pay that.

Now,

a

if that happens, that will have no effect on the rate-making

9

function or any other function, it would just have an effect

10

on the earnings per share of Penn Central which would be

It

diluted.

12

As far cis the equity holders of Penn Central were

\3

concerned, it would have some modest effect on the equity that

U

they would have, because there would be more shares outstanding.

13

And the earnings per share would therefore decline slightly.

13

It would have an immaterial effect, therefore, on

17

Penn Central stockholders and no effect on the public, if the

18

Commission elected to provide that difference in shares.

13

Q

But the new railroad to start out with a burden

20

of a $100 million, or whatever that difference is, that it's

21

had to pay out in some way, that would foe a part of its assets,

wouldn't it?

of this, they would have to put the burden on Penn Central.

be a serious burden.

of bonds, then those bonds, at a 5% rate, Penn Central would have

Exactly, Your Honor. The inflationary factor

alone is going to deprive him of a good deal of the risks.

What I meant was this:

In our briefs we have pointed
