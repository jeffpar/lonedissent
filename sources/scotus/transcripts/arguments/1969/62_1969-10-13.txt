MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will now hear Goldberg

against Kelly, with Mr. Loflin and Mr. Albert as counsel.

Mr. Loflin?

ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. LOFLIN, JR., ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

7

MR. LOFLIN:

May it please the Court, in this case, ur

8

like the California case you just heard described, there were

9

two separate statutory forms of benefits involved ~ the Federal

10

benefits,

which ©re substantially the same as those in the

n

California case? and what in New York is known as? “home relief”.

12

The presence of the home relief recipients as plain­

13

tiffs in the cases that are here consolidated accounted for at

14

least, in part, the decision of the court below to reach con­

IS

stitutional issuss, rather than leave the decision to rest upon

16

a statutory basis.

17

They reasoned, that even if they could resolve the case

18

as to the Federal beneficiaries, they would still have to face

19

the problem of what to do about State recipients.

20

pausing on that question, they went into the constitutional area

21

So without

These three cases, hare consolidated, ask for sub­

22

stantially identical relief, that is, as if went to the three-

23

judge court below, plaintiffs were asking for a preliminary

m

injunction requiring defendants to cease terminations without

ZB

having a prior hearing which, according to plaintiffs* judgment,
2

1

would meet the standard of due process of law

o

In addition, they wanted a declaratory judgment.

V*»

As

3

we got to the three-judge hearing stage , the declaratory judg­

4

ment section of that relief focused on a new New York State

S

regulation which was, in fact, promulgated after the first of

6

these cases was filed.
I would like to dwell for a moment on the sequence of

7
8

events, because it did have some influence, I believe, on the

9

decision below.
At the time the first of these cases was filed in New

10

n

York, there was no pre-termination conference hearing procedure.

12

It was entirely possible, and frequently happened, that a bene­

18

ficiary would simply receive a notice saying "Your benefits have

14

been cut off.

15

any rights you .might have to have a fair hearing.r'

Refer to your handbook or your pamphlet as to

This led to unfortunate circumstances, unfortunate

16
17

damage, to a number of recipients, and led directly to the filing

18

of a lawsuit.
Shortly after the suit was filed, New York Stats fol­

19

20

lowed California in adopting a pre-termination regulation.

21

is the regulation which is hare before this Court, No. 351.26.

22

As you may know, in the State of New York, well over

23
24
25

This

half of the total welfare recipients reside in the City of New
York.

The State, however, promulgated this new regulation with­

out consultation with the city.

It reached the city officials
3

1

in late February and was to become effective, by its terms, on

£

March 1.

3

or training or any real guidelines, much less any financing so

4

that this machinery could be set ap on what was at the time

5

two or three days8 notice.

6

The State, however, did not provide Hearing Officers

The city reacted to this by asking for conferences

7

with State officials to see if the impact of this new procedure

8

on the city administration could be lessened.

9

a series of conferences at which the difficulties of enforcing

In fact, after

10

the new State regulation in a city with approximately 1 million

11

people on welfare was pointed out, the State rescinded its ori­

12

ginal regulation and then, at the same time, put out. the regu­

13

lation which is now before this Court.

IS

19

It consists of two parts — 351.26(a) aa& 351.26(b).
A welfare district, of which New York City is one —
Q

Excuse me, counsel.

Where did you pinpoint, in

the briefs or record where we can find this.
A

In the.record it is set forth at 127(a)„ and that

is the regulation as finally adopted.

20

Q

is that contained in your brief on pages 2 to 5?

21

A

Yes, sir? 351.26(a) and (b).

22
23

as
25

They ere quoted in

several places, but that is one of them.
Q

It is set out in full, however, in your brief

pages 2 to 5?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

With the date April 26, 1968?

A

OQ

Q

That is the one.

4

A

Yes, sir.

5

Wow, both of these subparagraphs,, that is,

(a) and (to)

6

were challenged by the plaintiffs below»

7

of them, and held, in fact, that subparagraph {b), which had

8

been adopted in New York City, was unconstitutional as not afford

9

ing proper clue process of law, and in particular, the deficits

The court examined bot

\

10

that they pointed out were the lack of confrontation and cross- ;

11

examination.

12

The three-judge court in the Southern District saw no

13

room for that in the procedure before it under subparagraph (b)

14

and held that those were essential elements which must be pre­

13

sent.

!6

they Construed subparagraph (a) to require confrontation and

17

cross-examination of adverse witnesses and said, in effect, HXf

18

you don't operate it in that fashion, that section, too, would

19

foe unconstitutional

Since there was some ambiguity as to subparagraph (a),

and a denial of due process of law."

20

The State did not appeal in this case.

21

an interest in subparagraph (b), is here before the Court.

22
23
24
25

The city, with

It is vital to our case for the Court to understand
that we do not rest alone on subparagraph (b) of 351.26.

It is

the pattern of regulation in the State of Mew York for a city
welfare district, particularly one of the size of the city of

5

1

New York, to adopt its own implementing regulations, subject to

2

State approval»

3
4

That was done in this case»

Our local regulation is known as Procedure 68-18.
That is set forth in the record following pages 147 and 148.
I stress the importance of our local procedure because

5
6

I think the Court needs to have the full process before you and

1

understand particularly how the client first becomes involved in

8

these procedural steps.
Under our local procedure, the case worker is obliged

9
*0

to notify the client when information comes to him indicating

n

there is a question as to his continued eligibility to receive

12

benefits.

13

and discussing these matters with him in a face-to-face confer­

14

ence.

-

?

The case worker has the duty of calling the client inj

15

The client is in a position, then, to discover what

16

it is that has led the city to believe that this person is no

17

longer eligible.

18

why it is making a mistake, if it is, and to correct error, if

19

error there be.

20

.The client is? .in a position to tell the city

In the event the case worker determines after a con­

21

ference with the client that there is probable rea&cn to con­

22

clude that the client is, in fact, no longer eligible, the case

23

file and the case worker9s recommendation goes to the unit super

24

visor, where the entire matter is subject to review.

23

if the unit supervisor concurs in the judgment of the case works
6

It is only

1

that the formal notice contemplated by 351.26(b) is issued.

z
a

That notice tells the recipient —

4

this one you are talking about now?

Q

A

5

Is that what you consider due process notice,

Your Honor, I believe that the due process, as X

8

see it, begins at the point where the client is called in for a i

7

conference with the case worker.

I
Q

8
9

i

So your idea of due process is that the case

worker calls the person in, just two of them in the room, and

10

he gives them notice, and that is tho type of notice that is

11

due process notice?

|

IS

A

That is where the process begins, Your Honor.

13

Q

Is that a due process notice or not?

A

For the purposes of this case, under these factsj

14
IS

I believe that it is, yes.
Q

16

Well, how does that fife with the Constitution,

17

your idea of what due process is?

18

process or not?
A

29

Do you want to call this duo

I have accepted the fact that a welfare recipient-

faced with termination is entitled to due process appropriate tc
the circumstances.

This, to me, does not necessarily mean the

type of due process that would be appropriate under circumstance s
of criminal law or civil ease law or any number of other factual
patterns•
Q

Well, what is it similar to, or do you say that

7

1

it is something that is peculiar to welfare?

There are many facets which are peculiar to wel­

Q

Do you have any other cases that you could cite

fare*

to other than welfare cases?
A

As was adverted to earlier this morning, it bears

7

some resemblance to the cases where public employees have been

8

called up on charges and suspended, but later given an oppor­

a

tunity to be heard*

10

There is a situation where monetary bane-

fits of one sort or another are -'

11

Q

Well, do you see any difference between a Govern­

12

ment employee making $20,000 a year and a welfare worker as to

13

being able to live during this due process period?

14

•A

Well, obviously the impact on the individual is

IS

much worse if we make an error in the case of someone who is

16

destitute than if we make an error in the case of someone who

17

is well off.

18
19
20

21
22

Q

Wouldn't you then be inclined to give them some

due process?
A

I definitely would be inclined, and my position

is that this —
Q

Your idea of due process is that the case worker

23

that has investigated it and has made up his or liar mind that

24

this recipient doesn't deserve it any more, calls him in and

23

gives him notice and hearing and determination*
8

That is your

1

2

idea of due process»
A

I don't accept the hypothesis, sir, that the

S

case worker has a closed raind at the time ha invites the client,

4

to eaftta in.

S

Q

Well, who investigated it?

6

A

It may be the case worker.

7

from other sources.

8

from many sources.

S

from a friend.

10

Q

Information may coma

Information comes to the Welfare Department
It may come from a bank, from a landlady,

Well, would the case worker ask him to come in

if the ease worker hadn't

bility that perhaps the recipient might be wrong?

ts

A

thought that there was a bare possi- I

That is the reason he is called in.

The ease

14

worker has some information which hs wants verified.

55

hold of information which is of sufficient weight that he says,

56

“I need a personal conference with this person to hear their

17

aide of the story and maybe he can explain this away."

18
19

20

Q

He gets

A personal conference is nothing close to a due

process hearing, is it?
A

Your Honor, 1 contend that it is part of a pro­

21

cedure which, when taken in its entirety, constitutes such basic

22

fairness that it is due process of law.

23
24

£3

Q

That is your idea of fairness.

A

Taken altogether, it is my idea of fairness, but

not truncating it and chopping it off in one little chapter and

saying, "Well, -this is all the due process the person is going

a

to get."

A

Ho, sir•

7

Q

Well, when?

8

A

We have had the meeting with the ease worker.

9

When is the money cut off — when the supervisor

We have had the review by the Unit Supervisor.

We have had the j

10

notice go out to the client which gives him seven days to come

n

in with any written information, with the aid of counsel, he

14

sion at the case worker level.

15

That is then reviewed by still a third

This supervisory person gets the record and anything

18

submitted by the client, reviews the entire matter, and only

17

after he is satisfied that the person is ineligible» are the

18

benefits cut off.

19

Q

That is your idea of due process.

20

A

I think that meets due process; yes, sir.

Q

Mr. Loflin, 1 suppose up in Mariposa County,

where they have a few recipients and few staff members, it would
foe possible that the man who made the decision to grant the
benefit in the first place might be the same man who listened

Q

A small community in New York that would not have

a large staff of workers or a large number of recipients, if

S

you have such a community, is it possible, then, that the man

who granted the relief might be the man who was considering its

A

I believe that would not comply with the State

regulation in New York.

Under the new regulation? that is right.

Whether

13

it could happen, I can't tell you.

17

do have the highest volume in the country.

ii

1

When I suggested to Mr* Justice Marshall that the en­

z

tire procsss has to be looked at in order to see whether or not

c
s>

due process has been observed, I think it starts with the initia 1

4

conference with the case worker, and does not conclude until

5

after the fair hearing.

6
7

Q

And after the fair hearing is an opportunity for

judicial review, is there not?
A

8

Yes, sir.

Under Article 78 of the New York Civil!;

9

Practice Law and Rules, any decision of a Hearing Officer that

10

results in a denial of benefits, the parson whose benefits are

tl

denied is considered an aggrieved person and ha may sue the

12
13

State Hearing Officer and have the entire package, the record of!
th® case, reviewed by a. Stats Supreme Court Justice.
So we do have this gap that can occur and Mr. Justice

14
m

Marshall is entirely right, and there is no denying that a per- j

m

son who is, in fact, destitute can be hurt between th© period

17

when the Review Officer cuts off the benefits and the time when •!

18

if, in fact, we are wrong, th© State Bearing Officer restores

19

those benefits.

I
j

Qf .

20
2!

Is there any way of knowing how long that time'

is, on the average, or in a typical situation?
A

22

There is evidence in the case that it varies

23

tremendously.

New York had fallen behind beginning in about

24

1967.

23

were running at the rat® of 200 or 300 per month.

I might point out in th© first half of 1967 fair hearings

12

In the last

I

half of 1967,. they jumped to as high as 1100 per month.

2

problem has been alleviated somewhat.

This

The total number of

hearing officers has been increased by 50 percent.

We had only!
j

4

eight for the State at the beginning of this period.

5

6

We now

So as Mrs. Palmer advised the Court, California has

7

responded to the increased case load.

So has New York.

8

tell you that we have completely caught up on our backlog.

9

But we are making deep inroads into it and we hopa

10

fco bring the State of New York into compliance with the time-

It

table that the Federal Government has proposed.

i'

j

12

Q

And that is 60 days?

13

A

Yes, sir.

14

I would point out to you that in this case, in addi­

IS

tion fco the constitutional issues which drew the focus of atten­

IS

tion in the court below, there is a statutory regulatory scheme

17

which provides a framework within which the case could also be

18

examined.

19

Q

Which are you resting on?

20

A

I will rest on either, Your Honor.

21

22
23

24
25

I claim that

we have granted due process, if it is to be measured by consti­
tutional standards.

1 also claim here, and 2 believe that the

record will show, we are in compliance with the HEW regulations
on the subject.

Here, too, this was a development during the

course of this case.

The regulation to which I refer became

13

t

effective July 1, 1968, well after these cases had started,

2

but the regulation is set forth in part on page 12 of the

3

Solicitor General's brief.

4

It is very brief, if I may refer to it.

5

to the HEW handbook, Section 2300(d)(5), and if. states that

6

advance notice of questions it has about an individual6 s eligi- !

7

bility so that a recipient has an opportunity to discuss the

8

situation before receiving formal written notice of reduction

9

in payment of termination of assistance is required.

It is cited
j

Q

10

I gather, Mr. Loflin, that like California, the
\

n

city also concedes that constitutionally there is some obliga­

12

tion of some form of due process before termination may foe made.
A

13

Yes.

We have not denied that.

1 just point

14

this regulatory framework out to afford another basis for the

IS

Court's examination, if you wish.

from that entirely and went to the constitutional issue.

Q

I consider those procedures adopted through the local
regulation as complimentary to the State -regulation.

We could

Mr» Justice White, some of the interveners in thi

kinds of issues of termination, or are likely to be: confronted

I think that we are really confronted with all those
cases of the people who still continue to receive benefits, who
still are involved in this case worker relationship.
The terminations of the appellees, I think, nan be
grouped briefly into several categories.

21

It is important to

note that all of them had a conference or inerview with their

case worker before termination.

has long been required for the periodic recertification of

4

eligibility in New York and most other States, all other States,

3

was actually the cause of termination in many of these cases.

6

For example, John Kelly and Leroy Pavey were termi­

7

nated because, during that interview, they had a dispute with

8

the ease worker about where they should live.

9

their disagreement with the case worker over where they should

Two weeks before Angela Velez, who is discussed in

11
12

the opinion of Judge Feinberg below, was terminated she. had an

13

argument with her case worker over an extraneous matter, over

14

a special grant, and she actually asked the case worker to leave

15

the home.

16

informing her, I should say, she was terminated for concealment,

17

of assets, nothing further.

18

Two weeks later she received a Notice of Termination

I am quoting from that

decision, which is also printed in the record, Mr. Chief Justice.
As to the facts involved, Mr. Soto has never yet
learned just what this dispute was about, nor has his attorney,
Mr. Greenberg.

There were a few, however, who came into this lawsuit who cams

We left off before the lunchtime recess on the threshold

If one looks to the nature of ths factors that this

11

Court has traditionally deemed relevant, ths nature of the indi­

12

vidual interest, the nature of the Government interest, the

13

burden on the program or proceedings, one finds that all of

14

•those factors compel one answer.

15

The nature of ths individual interest that has been

examined is in his statutory entitlement of enormous value to

the beholders,

a statutory entitlement on which the very

quality of life depends.

This record makes very clear the con­

sequences of erroneous withdrawal of that entitlement.
Q

What is the closest case in this Court with that

proposition?
A

I think that the factor of gravity of harm, Mr.

Justice White, is reflected in, for example, the deportation of
alien cases in which ths agency is held to highest degree of
legal safeguards before an alien may be deported, although he
31

i

has no vested right to remain here, but because, as this Court

2

once said, deportation may deprive one of all that makes life

worth living.

I think it is very important in looking to that

to recognise that the subsequent fair hearing, in the light of

5

these circumstances - is largely an illusory and certainly an

z

ineffective remedy.

3

1 think this is one of those situations not dissimilar

4

to Sniadach in this respects that the delay in relief, putting

S

the decision into operation before an opportunity to contest it,

6

all but precludes the opportunity to contest.

16

Q

Of course, that could lead to quite a different

inference,. also, couldn't if?

58

that people are terminated with the exception of only about 50

A

It certainly could, Mr. Justice Stewart, except

;

for the fact that we have figures in this record, and no on©
I1
really argues about them, that the weight of administrative
error in denying or terminating aid is enormous.

33

The rate-

Our concern is with those in which the recipient dis­

16

the times in which the recipient, as opposed to the case worker, j

17

is correct is enormous.

18

It is singular, I think, in a Government benefit program.

10

In that narrow group cf cases, we find that

The rate of error is just startling.

Nonetheless, these decisions are not vindicated in

20

subsequent fair hearings for a variety of reasons, not

2!

of which is that the overwhelming impact, the interim depreda­

34

The burdens it incurs is better revealed in the fact

in New York City, there were 1,000 prior hearings requested, _ in
out of which ?X percent of the recipients prevailed.
Sven under the Government*s test in its memorandum
of whether* more eligible than ineligible people requested hear­
ings, we would prevail in this case.
In comparing also those additional costs for the one
or two weeks, and after all, the only additional costs, we be­
lieve, that can be considered here are those that are the oneor two-week payments to people who are ultimately found ineli­
gible, in comparing that, one must also look to the kind of
cumbersome procedure that New York City seems to offer»

To the extent that prior hearings will be used more

as a result of removing this deterrent, we don’t think those are

Absolutely not.

Why not?

13

A

Well, for factors, one, observed in Cafeteria

Workers versus McElroy, the Government engaged in a managerial

function as employer; to the discretionary kinds of decisions,

16

which is slightly different; and three, the question of a sus­

pension of an employee may well fall into one of those extra­
ordinary situations laid out by this Court where, for example,
the employee represents some immediate threat to the service or

10

to the Department.

That is not the case here.

the ordinary employee, no unusual circumstances, except someone

I would like to ask one question,

12

I thought I saw among the papers that have been filed j

\3

a reference to a Federal regulation that would require, in

14

relation to AFDC, for example, relief a continuance of benefit

15

payments even though they were terminated at a pre-hearing stage

16

until the final hearing post-termination stage had been reached.

25

A

That is correct, Mr. Justice Harlan. It was pro­

mulgated a year ago by HEW.
Q

What bearing does that have on your position?

A

I think it verifies that the fair hearing require

ment of the Federal Act, which after all does import notions of
due process into it, cannot be truly effective unless the hear­
ing is prior, and that is what HEW said when it promulgated the
regulation.

We think the relevance is that it represents the judg­

7

ment of the administrative agency charged knowing something

8

about these matters, but that is required and that is still

current Federal policy although its effective date is post-

10

requirement.
Q

If it were in effect now, what effect would it

have on these cases?

of providing them with the relief they want, as interpreted by

22

the Government.

Was that promulgated by the last Administration?

A

It was, Mr. Justice Brennan, although it was
46

promulgated actually in final form in January 1969, during the

transition, I think it is fair to say, with the concurrence of

3

both Administrations, but the postponement is of this Admin­
