Good morning gentlemen.

ARGUMENT OF ALFRED L. EVANS, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

No. 21, Dutton against

MR. EVANS:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it

please the Courts

10

This case presents the question of whether the hear-»

11

say rule is to be read into and equated with the confrontation

12

clausa of the Sixth Amendment.

13

The factual setting in which the question arose was

14

petitioner Evans trial for murder in connection with the slaying

15

of three police officers in Gwinnett County, Georgia.

is

cipal witness for the State was Wade Truett, an accomplice who

17

turned State's evidence.

18

The prin­

Truett testified as an eye witness to all material

19

details of the triple slaying,

20

in question, and I will not go into it in great detail.

21

I do think it may be appropriate to touch upon the highlights of

22

his te stimony.

23

Truett*s testimony is not hare
However,

After relating the essential elements of a car theft

24

conspiracy, Truett testified how, along with the petitioner

25

Evans and one Venson Eugene Williams, they stole a car in

1

Atlanta,, Georgia.

2

in nearby Gwinnett County, where they decided they would change

3

the license plates and the ignition switch.

4

The stolen car was driven to a rural locatioi

While in the process of changing the plates and the

5

switch, they were apprehended by the soon to die police officers

6

Unfortunately, the youngest officer, while bending over the

7

front seat of the car examining the ignition switch, put himseli

8

in such a position as to enable Evans to remove his revolver.

9

Evans ordered all three officers to raise their hands.

10

They were then disarmed and manacled with their own handcuffs.

II

At this point, Truett took the police car and drove it off into

12

the woods for concealment.

13

where Evans and Williams were with the three police officers,

14

he heard what sounded to him to be — he described it as "a

15

nickel pack of firecrackers going off.’’

16

As he was returning to the spot

Upon his arrival, he saw the police officers on the

17

ground, still handcuffed together.

18

making a peculiar sound.

19

fire two or three more times into the police officer, while

20

Evans held the flashlight.

21

One police officer was

Truett's testimony was corroborated by physical evi­

22

dence as well as the evidence of other witnesses.

23

testimony of one of the corroborating witnesses which gives

24
25

It was the

rise to the questions which are presented to the Court today.
The witness in question is Lynwood Shaw.
3

Shaw was a fellow

!

inmate of Venson Eugene Williams in the Federal Penitentiary

2

at the time Williams was arraigned for the murder.

3

following his arraignment, Shaw asked Williams how he made out.

4

The rather spontaneous exclamation in reply was, "If it hadn’t

5

been for that dirty s.o.b. Alex Evans, we wouldn't be in this

6

r ow."

7

On the day

The testimony was admitted over objection.

The trial

8

court based its ruling on the fact that the State, in the

9

opinion of the trial court, had made a prima facie case of an

SO

auto theft conspiracy, and the statement was, therefore, admis­

n

sible under the exception to the hearsay rule for co-conspirator

32

an exception which is provided by statute in Georgia.

33

Q

Evans was tried separately?

14

A

Yes, sir.

In Georgia, when you have a situation

15

like this, it is a matter of right that the accused can have

16

separate trials.

Would you mind stating again what the exception

A

The exception was that the State had shown a

prima facie conspiracy to steal automobiles.

Yes, sir.

This is a distinction between what I

believe is a majority rule in the States and the rule in the

Federal courts.

This Court, in cases such as Krulewitch, decided that

Petitioner

18

Evans was convicted.

He raised the issue, among others, in his

19

appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia, his conviction was

20

affirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia, and this Court denied

21

certiorari.

22

Having exhausted his direct appeals, Petitioner Evans

23

turned to the United States District Court, where he petitioned

24

for a writ of habeas corpus.

25

The District Court denied the

writ, citing Wigmore to the effect that: the evidentiary rule and

6

|

1

the constitutional standard are not the same, and that the

2

confrontation clause does not prescribe what kinds of testi­

3

monial statements may be given by a witness who is on the stand

4

and is available for cross-examination.

5

Upon appeal, however, the Court of Appeals took an

6

entirely different view of the matter.

7

the District Court, and I think unlike the prior decisions of

8

this Court, the Court of Appeals viewed the constitutional stan­

9

dard as one which incorporates the exclusionary rule of evidence

10

11

Unlike Wigxnore, unlike

when it is hearsay.
Nor did the Court of Appeals stop where the generally

12

recognised exceptions to the rule begin.

What did Bruton hold?

to statements of a co-defendant, didn't it?
A

Yes, sir? it was the statement of a co-defendant

and it was a confession, if you will, of a co-defendant in a
joint trial, . which we think is a situation quite different froa
this, and Bruton expressly pointed out in a footnote to that
decision — I think a very important footnote -- where it statec
that the evidence there in question was not admissible under
any recognised exception to the hearsay rule, and in Bruton the
Court went on to say that it did not mean to imply in any mannei

7

1

whatsoever that exceptions to the hearsay rule necessarily raise

2

problems under the confrontation clause, and in so doing it

cited Wigmore, the particular section on which we rely in Wig-

4

more, and it also cited the prior decision of this Court in

5

Mattox, on which we also rely.

6

Q

Bruton at least said that in some situations the

7

confrontation clause is not satisfied simply by confronting a

8

witness on the stand.

9

A

Yes, sir.

I think there probably

is some overla p„

10

This Court — it is a difficult task, but I think the task of

1?

this Court is to delineate the scope of the confrontation clause

12

Of course, this v?as all somewhat an academic matter prior to

13

Pointer when the Sixth Amendment'was applied to the States.

14

Until that time, it really, didn't matter too much to the Federal

15

criminal defendant whether his reversal was based upon a pro­

16

cedural rule, hearsay, or the confrontation clausa,

17

In any event, the Court of Appeals stated that hence­

13

forth all State exceptions would have to be continually scruti­

13

nised and re-evaluated and that the State exceptions would be

20

permitted only where supported by salient and cogent reasons.

21

Being of the opinion that the reasons in the case at

22

bar were not sufficiently salient or cogent, the Court of Appeal s

23

reversed, saying that the Georgia statutory exception, as con­

24

strued by the Supreme Court of Georgia, and as applied under the

25

facts and circumstances of the case at bar, violated Evans8

8

1

confrontation rights.

2

In our brief , we set forth four reasons why we think

3 ! the Court of Appeals was wrong and ought to be reversed.
4

j

First

and foremost, we think the Court of Appeals erred when it

5 i elevated that ancient and much maligned exclusionary rule known
6
7

as the hearsay rule to the level of a constitutional mandate.
The view stated by Wigmore, which we think to be the

8

correct view under prior decisions of this Court, is that the.

9

Constitution does not deal with the questions of what kinds of

10

testimonial statements must be given infra-judicially, this

11

being dependent upon the law of evidence for tha time being,

12

but only upon what procedure shall be followed, which is, of

13

course, a cross-examining procedure, as to that testimony which

14

is required by the ordinary rules of evidence to be given infra-

15

judicially.

IS

This appears to be the view which this Court followed

17

in Mattox versus United States, where it pointed out that the

18

confrontation clause was designed primarily to exclude ex parte

19

affidavits and depositions, but not to go to the competency of

20

testimony of the witness who does appear in court and. is avail­

21

able for cross-examination,,

22

I have already pointed out that in Bruton, the Court

23

pointed out that the evidence there in question was not recog­

24

nized by any exception to the rule and that the Court intimated

25

no view whatever that hearsay exceptions raise questions under
9

1

the confrontation clause, and it cited the particular provision

2

of Wigmore to which I refer, and also to the-Mattox decision

3

which we cite in our brief.

4

We urge the Court not to read the hearsay rule, with

5

or without exceptions, into the confrontation clause. Wa think

6

it is a rule singularly undeserving of the honor.

7

as far as I am aware, in any system of jurisprudence other than

8

the Anglo-Saxon system. To.the best of my knowledge, it has been

9

roundly criticised by every scholar of our system.
Q

10

It is unknown

Do you think if these two men had been tried

11

together*, Williams and Evans, that Williams® statement would

12

have been admissible at the trial if he hadn’t testified under

13

an exception to the hearsay rule?
A

14

Ye3, sir,
*

15
16

17

Q

Bruton just wouldn't cover that sort of situa­

A

Wo, sir.

tion.
I think Bruton applies — in the first

18

place, Wigmore and the other authorities usually distinguish

19

between a confession which is an admission as to every material

20

element of the crime, and other admissions.

21

Particularly, of course, you have the situation in

22

Bruton where the confession was to police authorities.

23

it was a postal authority in Bruton, as I recall it.

24
25

I think

We think that the situation respecting a confession,
particularly a confession to public authorities, is quite
10

1

different from an admission — actually I don't know how much

2

of an admission this statement was.

3

cryptic statement, but presumably admission against penal admis­

4

sion at best.

5

Q

To me it is a rather

We think the situation is quite different.
Is this an argument, Mr. Evans, that if Williams

6

had taken the stand, if they had been tried jointly and Williams

7

had taken the stand and had testified, as he did here, put these

3

words in Evans' mouth, that Bruton would not have applied?

9

A

No, sir; I don’t think that Bruton would have

SO

applied because as 1 read Bruton it applies to confessions,

IS

and particularly confessions to police officers.

12

Q

All right, let’s put it this way, then:

Williams

13

did not take the stand, but they introduced a confession of

14

Williams against Williams which contained this statement of

15

Williams about Evans.

16

A

Would Bruton there have applied?

I think it would possibly apply if the confes­

17

sion had been made to police officers.

18

is this, Mr. Justice Brennan:

19

cers obviously cannot be consistent with the conspiracy.

20

in negation of the conspiracy.

21

I think the distinction

A confession made to police offi­
It is

It ends the conspiracy.

I donEt think this is necessarily the same as a con­

22

fession to a fellow inmate in a prison who one might assume

23

would not, as it were, "spill the beans."

24

distinction between the two situations, plus the fact that here

25

I think there is a

this statement by no stretch of the imagination could be

2

Q

So if Williams had told Shaw, "Yes, we did it;

3

I was party to it," and then had said what he did about Evans,

4

of course, this was not said to a police officer, but Shaw, then

5

Burton would not apply.
A

6

Of course, this issue has never been decided.

I

7

personally would urge that rule.

8

that comes in the co-conspirator conception.

11

Q

Bruton didn’t address itself to this situation.

12

A

No, sir.

13

Q

You say it didn’t.

14

If there had been a conspirac Y

shown in Bruton, then that would be a different matter.
A

15

If the confession were made, I would say, during

16

the pendency of the conspiracy, and if it were made to a person

17

other than a public authority, such as — I think you would have

18

to get into the facts of the particular situation, but I think

19

it would be possible that it would be admissible under Bruton.
Q

20

What is the basis of the distinction, Mr. Evans,

2!

whether the confession is made to a public officer or someone

22

else?

23
24
25

What is the basis for that?
A

The basis for the distinction would be that in a

conspiracy situation, it is consistent with continuation of the
conspiracy to have a statement made to another individual.
12

It

1

is consistent with the continuance of the conspiracy,

2

if there is a confession to a police officer, I think that is

**v

obviously inconsistent with the continuance of the conspiracy.

o

Q

4

However,

Is there not also another factor, that a police

5

officer in that circumstance has or is thought to have sometimes

6

by some, a special interest in helping to convict the man; whereas

7

a co-conspirator would not be in that category.

exception to the hearsay rule is?
A

The traditional rule has been along an agency

theory; that when people are acting together to accomplish an

14

illegal purpose, the acts and statements of one party are admis­

15

sible in evidence against all other parties because they are

working together as agents.

17

the view that there is something inherently more evil about a

Of course,the Isv has always taken

18

combination to commit crime than the perpetration by a single

13

individual.

20

Q

21

All that, means is that you can ascribe the co-

conspirator "s statement to the defendant himself.

22

A

Yes, that is the rule of evidence.

23

Q

And you done t think there is anything in the

24
20

fact that there is some substitute for cross-examination in this
exception, namely, that there is some indicia of reliability
13

1

so that you don't need cross-examination?

2

A

Yes, sir.

3

Q

Such as an admission against interest?

4

A

I think in this particular statement, to go into

3

the question of trustworthiness, which of course is one of the

0

usual justifications for an exception to the hearsay rule, I

7

think that this statement is probably trustworthy for several

a

reasons.
In the first place, it is not a long narrative in

9
10

which the danger of error in the retelling would be very great.

ii

It is & specific response to a very specific question.

12

If the witness had 'testified as to a physical impres­

13

sion, such as anger, flushed face, I think no one would questior

14

that that would be admissible.

15

discriminating against auditory perceptions in favor of a visual

IQ

perception when the statement is so brief, so short?

17
18

Is there any good reason for

not.
Secondly, it is a statement which is against the

19

penal Interest of the declarant.

20

ordinarily would not be made, I think, unless true.

21

22
23
24
25

I think

This is a statement which

Finally, when you compare it to the other recognised
exceptions —
Q

So this is another exception entirely, isn't it,

in addition to the co-conspirator exception?
A

Yes, sir? but I am saying that this particular
14

I

statement in the case at hand is trustworthy, for what it is

z

worth.

3

Q

You think Williams' testimony would have been

4

admissible — say the rule in Georgia were the rule in the

5

Federal Court, as far as the co-conspirator is concerned.

6

this statement by Williams to Shaw have been admissible anyway

1

on the basis that it was a declaration against penal interest?
A

S
9

I really cannot answer that.

Woulc

That was not the

grounds urged by counsel and, therefore, I cannot answer.

10

Q

Your argument goes in that direction.

11

A

My argument goes in that direction for purposes

12

of demonstrating, I hope, to the Court that the statement was

13

trustworthy; only for a demonstration.
I might point out that this Court has consistently

U
15

recognized exceptions such as dying declaration.

16

statement like this is at least as trustworthy as a dying

17

declaration.
Q

18

I think a

But Mr. Evans, doesn't this really border on an

19

argument that any hearsay statement of which it can be said

20

their indicia of trustworthiness is admissible without regard

21

to whether it is within any of the exceptions?
A

22

Well, sir, if there is an error in hearsay, I

23

agree.

24

const!tufcional dimensions, if there is an error in the admis­

25

I do not think it necessarily reaches a problem of

sion of hearsay.
15

1

Of course, it is always true in hearsay that hearsay,

2

per se, relates to an out-of-court declaration, so to that ex­

3

tent, any time there is any hearsay —

4

Q

Well, the trend you mentioned earlier to admit

5

hearsay, I gather, r&sts at least in part, doesn*t it, on ques­

6

tions of the trustworthiness, the reliability of it?

7

A

Trustworthiness and also the general feeling that,

8

after all, the purpose of evidence is to shed light and many

9

judges have written that they feel that the suppression of hear­

10

say, more often than not, keeps light off the matter under in­

1?

vestigation and causes more damage than good.

12

In any event, the test has been roundly criticised by

13

all legal scholars and we feel it would be a pity if the re­

14

formers have to fight a constitutional standard as well as what

15

we think are far too many years of inertia.

16

While we think the primary legal error of the Court

17

of Appeals was its equating of the evidentiary rule and con­

IS

stitutional standard, we feel that the far greater mischief

19

potential in its decision it set forth for review by Federal

20

judges of the application of State exceptions.

21

According to the Court of Appeals, no matter how

2Z

settled a State exception might be, its application by a State

23

judge in a State criminal proceeding is subject to reversal by

24

a reviewing Federal judge if the Federal judge is of the opinion

25

that the reasons in the particular case for the adherence to
16

1

State law were not sufficiently salient or cogent.

2

In reality? this is just a pure second-guessing test.

3

Tbs entirely subjective nature of this test? we -think? can con­

4

tribute only further to the lamentable trend for State criminal

5

proceedings to be conducted as ping-pong notches between State

6

and Federal tribunals.
We hope? first and foremost? that this Court will

7
8

decline to elevate the hearsay rule to a constitutional stan­

9

dard? but should the Court disagree? we hope at the very minimum;

10

that the Court will provide some intelligible? objective stan­

51

dards so the trial judges? State trial judges? may have some

12

idea how to conduct criminal trials when the question of hearsay

13

arises.
We think this much is necessary to the orderly dis­

14
15

position of State criminal trials.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B» THOMPSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

19

20

Mr. Thompson?

MR. THOMPSON:

If it please the Court, I would like

2!

to, for purposes of placing this issue in what I consider to

22

be the context of the matter, describe what the Georgia statute

23
24

25

is held by the Supreme Court and by the Appellate Courts of
Georgia to mean,
This statute, as applied by the Supreme Court of
19

1

Georgia,, the Appellate Courts of Georgia, differs from the

2

Federal rule substantially, and differs, we submit, from the

3

rules of all of the States that we are acquainted with.

4

The statute provides that once the fact of conspiracy

5

has been established, the acts and declarations of all con­

S

spirators are admissible in evidence against each other.

7

One of the flagrant things that is missing from that

a

statute, as construed by the. Supreme Court of Georgia, that is

9

present in all of the other interpretations of similar excep­

10

tions, is that the statement or declaration must have been made

11

in furtherance of the conspiracy? that is to say, that, for in­

12

stance, where two might conspire to burglarize, a grocery store,

13

if one of the conspirators was sitting in the automobile outside

14

the grocery store, and the other one entered, I am satisfied

13

that the evidence of the acts of each could be admitted against

16

the other to prove the conspiracy itself and to prove the con­

17

cert of action.

18
19

20
21

Likewise, if some declaration was made in furtherance
of the conspiracy once it has been established, that is, using
a similar example, if one of the conspirators had been designated
the function of going to purchase a gun, and maybe the two of

22

them went together to purchase it, and one of them did all of

23

the talking, the testimony with regard to what this man stated

24

25

to the gun merchant would be admissible against both of them
if the two were otherwise connected, because these acts or these
20

I

declarations would have been, or could be construed to have

2

been in furtherance of the conspiracy.

3

The Supreme Court of Georgia — I refer feo the Supreme

4

Court? 1 could refer to the Court of Appeals,, we have a Court of

5

Appeals and a Supreme Court in Georgia.

6

courts have, in the past, recognised the rule as we have stated

7

it, similar to the Federal rule? that is, if the act or if the

8

declaration ware in furtherance of the conspiracy which had

9

been proved, it would be admissible against any co-conspirator

10

II

These two appellate

who was shown to be a member of the conspiracy.
The older Georgia cases — we have cited some in our

12

brief -- have gone along with this rule.

But Somewhere along

13

the line, without ever overruling that rule, the appellate

14

courts of Georgia have dropped the “furtherance" requirement

15

and recognize only that if a statement is made during the

16

course of a conspiracy, during its pendency, then it is admis­

17

sible against all of the co-conspirators, whether or not it was

18

in furtherance of the conspiracy.

10

Q

How long has this statute been on the books?

20

A

If it please the Court, the statute has been on

21

the books since the Parks Annotated Code, which is our oldest

22

code, I believe, in Georgia.

23

criminal code in Georgia is based on decisional law, basically,

24
25

It came from decisional lav/.

that we have in Georgia,

during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy."
Q ,

Right, and the statute hare says -’'during the

2

extended to the period of concealment, so-called, as well as

3

the active operation of the conspiracy.

4

A

Yes, sir.

The question of concealment is a

5

second vice that we have not urged as broadly as we have the

6

question of furtherance in this case.

7

recognised both of these problems in its opiniosi.

8

that point, however, dwelling on the question of furtherance.

9

The Court of Appeals
We were at

Under the Georgia rule, of course, the courts have

10

construed a conspiracy to continue so long as the co-conspiratox s

11

are attempting in any way to conceal the fact of the crime, and

12

as we understand the decisions of the Georgia court actually

13

up until the time the co-conspirators are electrocuted, so long

14

as one or more of them denies the crime.

IS

We have labored the point, however, in our brief and

16

in our argument, not attacking so much that facet of the law,

17

although we do attack it, but attacking the facet that makes

18

the declaration admissible although it not be in furtherance of

19

the conspiracy.

20

this reason:

21

We think that this is much more important for

We think that a statement made during the course of a

22

conspiracy which is not in furtherance of the conspiracy could

23

be much more harmful than a statement made during a period of

24

time when the conspiracy is being concealed, if it were in some

25

way in furtherance of the conspiracy.

23

1

We depict the situation there where, during the con­

2

cealment period,, one of the defendants or one of the co-conspira

■O

tors continues laying the groundwork for future evidentiary

4

matters which would attempt further to conceal it, or for that

the Chief Justice's question, a question of whether or not a

It doesn't purport to come under the conspiracy

It would not have been in

floor would have said exactly the same words as he said here,

equally relevant, wouldn't they?

X think that is the very point that I am making.

16

and that would not have been.

Q

We

But the dying declaration exception is a differ­

ent exception, as Mr. Justice Stewart has pointed out.

19

A

Yes, sir.

20

Q

Do you regard it as any more or less reliable

21

22
23
24
25

than the statement made here?
A

Under the concept of the law as I understand it,

it has some reliability and trustworthiness because a man, undei
the dying declaration statute, does not make a statement until
such time that he is in extremis and knows that he is, and
25

i

therefore he is about to meet his Maker and would not lie.

2

is the theory of it.

3

This

I think, though, we go very far afield from what we
are talking about here.
Q

Necessarily what we are talking about hare is not;

6

that — you have to argue more than that the Georgia exception

7

to the hearsay' rule is, as a matter of policy, too broad.

8

have to argue, necessarily, since you are in a Federal Court

9

here, that it violates some provision of the Constitution.

10
1?

12

A

You

That is correct, and we contend that it violates,

of course, the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.
Q

Would you, in answer to the Chief Justice’s hypo­

13

thetical question, also think that the dying declaration exceo-

14

fcicn, under the circumstances that he described, that the Sixth

15

Amendment would prevent the admission of a statement made under

16

the conditions he described?

y

If it please the Court, I think that the excep­

18

tion as to the dying declaration is so well established in our

19

law, both in our Federal and our State law, that I would have

20

difficulty attacking that.

3

I would say that I would not be on as firm ground,
since the exception is so ancient and well recognized.

4

The Court —- and I again point to the decisions of

5

this Court which we think are relevant,» although all of them are

6

not directly in point with the issue we have here — Pointer has

7

been mentioned and 1 would , just by way of refreshment as much

8

as anything else, say that in Pointer, testimony of a witness

©

given at a preliminary examination,

at a time when the dsfendar t

10

did not have an attorney present, was admitted against Pointer

21

at the primary trial of this case.

12

This was admitted under the theory that the witness

13

had since left the State and did not intend to return to the

14

State.

25

The Court held that this was a denial of confrontatior

22

think that the transcript would be much more reliable than the

22

oral testimony of one who heard the testimony or one who put

23

the transcript in the form that it was in, the court reporter,

24

for instance.

a witness has sinca died and has previously testified and been

2

subject to cross-examination, his testimony ..might be related

3

during a subsequent trial to the jury from the memory of one

4

who heard it, and this is a further exception.

5

What I am pointing out here is that in Pointer we

8

were talking about confrontation, as we are talking about con-

7

frontation here, and it was not significant, we submit, in

8

Pointer that this was a transcript as opposed to oral testimony.

9

We think the fact that something is reduced to writing, and som?

10

distinction has been attempted by the Attorney General, has no

11

significance, whether it be oral or in writing.

12

tion of confrontation, nevertheless.

It is a ques­

13

In any event, that was the situation in Pointer.

14

In Douglas versus Alabama, cited in our brief, the

15

Court will recall that the co-defendant was placed on the wit­

16

ness stand.

17

on the grounds that his testimony might incriminate him, and

18

significantly, or interestingly, the situation was somewhat

19

like the situation we have here.

20

previously tried and convicted in a separate trial from the

21

defendant on trial.

22

He was asked some questions and refused to testify

The eb-defendanfc had been

In any event, the District Attorney was permitted to

23

read to the co-defendant a confession that the co-defendant

24

had given which involved the defendant on trial, and as he read

25

it from line to line, or from phase to phase, ha would ask the
28

i

co-defendant who was physically on the witness stand whether or

2

not ha had made such a statement, and on each occasion the co­

3

defendant 'would state, "X refuse to testify on the grounds that

4

it might incriminate me»S!

5

After thus having placed before the jury, actually not

6

in the form of evidence, the confession of the co-defendant, the

7

District Attorney put a witness on the witness .stand to prove

8

that the co-defendant who had refused to testify had given a

9

confession, had it identified, but the confessiori itself was

10

never introduced into evidence, and indeed, under the law of

11

Alabama, apparently was not admissible.
So here again we have a situation where we have oral

12

13

testimony.

We are not dealing with something necessarily

14

physical — a writing, a transcript, a written confession.

15

Court, of course, in that case held that the co-defendant, the

16

one on trial, although the witness against him was physically

17

on the witness stand, was denied the right of confrontation.

The

In Bruton versus the United States, this was a case

18
19

that arose in the Federal courts and it is so recent that X am

20

satisfied that the Justices remember the facts of the case, but

21

in substance, a confession of one co-conspirator or co-defendant

2Z

was admitted in the course of the trial under the then approved

23

instructions that it would be considered only as to him and not

24

as to the co-defendant who was mentioned in it, but xfho did not

rule, under the statute that we have here involved in Georgia,
that the confession in the Bruton case in a Georgia court would
have been admitted without error.

It is admissible under the

rule that we have here in question, and we have again cited a
case or two in our brief where a confession of a co-conspirator,

17
co-defendant, not on trial, was admitted against the defendant
18
19

on trial.
Unddr this particular rule, the Court said in the

20
Evans case, and the one we have here under review, the Court said
21
under this rule it was a statement made during the pendency ol

22
a conspiracy and the conspiracy continued until the men finally
23
were brought to justice$ as long as one or more of them are
24
denying their guilt, there is a conspiracy; therefore, this is

admissible, even though under Bruton, and actually under the

decisions prior to Bruton, it would not have bean admitted in

Brcokhart v. Janis, I believe, was the first of these

12

decisions chronologically that I have recited to the Court, but

13

whether or not it was, in that case the defendant had waived

14

counsel and waived certain rights at the preliminary hearing,

15

and on the trial of the case the testimony that was given at

16

the preliminary hearing was introduced in evidence against

17

Janis.
The Court there held that this was a denial of con­

18
19

frontation.

Janis did not have an attorney, or Brookhart, whiclr

20

ever one was the complaining party, did not have an attorney at

21

the preliminary hearing and had not intelligently waived his

22

right to cross-examination, as we recall that case.
Roberts versus Russell, which is also cited in our

brief, merely holds that the Bruton rule is applicable to State

Courts.

There are a number of reasons.

As a criminal

practitioner, I follow the practice not to use co-conspirators

as witnesses in a case generally because I feel a jury will not

accept their testimony.

testimony of the defendant, himself, they will not accept the

testimony of Williams.

Q

Mr. Thompson, what do you say about the State's

1

a.>.guztitenfc about the Chapman case?

2

A

Harmless error.

I wanted to get to that and I was saving that

3

until last and I am about to approach that unless the Court

4

would like me to approach it at this time. .

6

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
that you have only about two minutes.

7
8

Let rae remind you, counsel,

MR. THOMPSON:

All right, sir.

I will make it in two

minutes, then.

9

I will point out that actually what the State is

10

attempting to do in this case is to get the Court to reverse

11

Pointer, overrule Pointer, Douglas, Brookhart, Bruton and

12

Roberts.

13

the Court rule in this case, it would be necessary for the

14

Court to overrule those decisions, to certainly diminish their

15

effect substantially.

1©

We think that in order to rule as the State would have

Under the harmless error rule, as decided by this

17

Court in Chapman versus California, the Court would have to de­

18

clare a belief that it was a harmless error beyond a reasonable

19

doubt before that would be applicable here.

20

This Court, incidentally, as we understood Brookhart

21

v. Janis, as we understood the Court in that case, it said that

22

this error is so fundamental — that is, the denial of confron­

23

tation is so fundamental -- that prejudice need not be shown?

24

that it will be presumed.

25

very recently the case of Harrington versus California in which

Since that time the Court has decided

37

1,

it held the denial of Confrontation to be harmless error, but
/

2

I will hastily run over reasons why 1 think this is not harm­

3

less error.

4

First of all, under Georgia law, in order for a con­

5

spiracy to be proved by the testimony of a single witness -- by

S

an accomplice, I should say — the testimony must be corrobo­

7

rated.

3

that this tended to corroborate the testimony of Truett and,

9

therefore, could not have been harmless.

This was a corroboration of the testimony.

We think

Truett was the only real evidence in the case, what

10

HI

he testified to.

Under the evidence in the case, he had bean

12

given immunity from prosecution for a triple murder and also

13

had been promised assistance in securing a parole from a Federal

14

sentence that he was serving, and perhaps also other inducements

15

We think that this was a close case from that standpoint, and

16

that Shaw's testimony as to a statement made by a co-defendant

17

might well have turned the tide.
The statement, as we stated, is an accusatory state­

13
19

ment.

We are satisfied of that. The State thought so at the

20

time and brought Mr. Shaw from the Federal Penitentiary in

21

Atlanta to Gwinnett County to testify solely to this.

22
23
24

Q

Is that all that Shaw testified to?

A

Yes, sir.

This was the only testimony that Mr.

Shaw testified to.
The light is on, and I assume under the rules I am

25
through.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALFRED L. EVANS, JR., ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

7

MR. EVANS:

8

only on two matters.

9

May it pleas® the Court, I would comment

First, dealing with the last question, I think there

10

is no doubt that if the case should be remanded, Witherspoon

11

would be applied and, therefore, it would not.be a death penalty.

12

Secondly, I would like to comment briefly -----

13

Q

14
15

You are conceding that there were violations of

the Witherspoon doctrine in the qualification of the trial jury?
A

Yes, sir.

It was held in the case.

This has

16

already been held in the Williams case and we would concede that

17

there would have to be commutation of the penalty to life im­

18

prisonment.

19

Q

Has it beencommuted?

20

A

No, sir.

Q

Why not?

A

Because in the

21

22
23
24

25

Williams case the Court of Appeals

remanded for the application of Witherspoon.

In this case, they

held that a new trial was required because of the denial of
confrontation and said, therefore, they did not reach Witherspoon.
39

i

However, they suggested upon retrial that the Court consider

2

fchxs .

3

Q

It is my understanding that the Attorney General

4

of Georgia agrees that the Witherspoon case requires that the

5

sentence be commuted.

6

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

My question is, why hasn't it been?

8

Q

If the defendant wins, it -would be much more than

a commutation.

9

Am I right?
This will be applied.

It will be a new trial, and maybe a verdict of

acquittal.

10

A

II

Right, it will be a retrial.

Yes, sir.

There

is no question it will be commuted.

12

My only other comment has to do with the furtherance

13
14

rule.

Thera are many variants of furtherance in the various

15

States.

16

use the word ''furtherance" -— they say "relevancy".

The Georgia view is — they interpret it; they don't

In our brief we cite a Federal Court which interpreted

17
18

furtherance exactly the same way.

19

anywhere that I know of that the actual statement itself must

20

further the conspiracy.

to acts taking place during the conspiracy.
Q

I think it is not the rule

I think it is sufficient that it relates

May I ask you one question:

Why would the Wither­

spoon case compel a commutation of sentence?

many errors alleged in the --

I
2

Suppose it should be tried again before a jury

and the Witherspoon question did not come in.

3

A

this is so.

would have a new jury and there could be a death penalty if the

6

new trial is granted.

7

Q

There might be no commutation required, you mean?

8

A

Yes, sir.

9

Of course, if the new trial is granted, yes,
If the new trial is granted, then, of course, it

I am assuming that on remand, if the

case is remanded to the Fifth Circuit, under this trial, the

10

trial which we have had, Witherspoon is applicable.

Of course,

11

if there is a new trial, presumably the District Attorney would

12

examine the witness in such a way as to comport with Wither­

13

spoon .

MR. THOMPSON:

cut of order to ask for one moment, for one sentence to answer
what has just been said.
I would like to state that the Georgia Supreme Court,
in cases such as this, has now held that a case otherwise sub­
ject to Witherspoon would be remanded to the trial court for a
trial on the issue of penalty only.
Q

On what?

A

On the issue of penalty only.
