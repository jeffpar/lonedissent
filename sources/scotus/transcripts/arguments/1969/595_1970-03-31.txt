Mrs. Renne, you may proceed.
ARGUMENT OF LOUISE H. RENNE, ESQ,,

S

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6
7

MRS. RENNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

8

This case arises on a petition for writ of certiorari

9

filed by the Warden of California State Prison from a decision

10

rendered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth

11

Circuit .

12

United States District Court for the North District of California

13

to entertain a petition for writ of habeus corpus filed, by a

14

California prisoner serving a California sentence in California

15

in order to challenge the constitutionality of an unrelated

16

North Carolina conviction sentence of which he has yet to serve,

17

The Court below held, the jurisdiction existed in

The Court below held that the California warden was an

18

agent for the State of North Carolina and the proper party respon­

19

dent to defend the action.

20

It is respectfully submitted that the question raised in.

21

this case is essentially one and that is whether habeus corpus

22

relief is presently available to a California prisoner in Cali­

23

fornia, who seeks to challenge the constitutionality of a sen-

24

fence which has been imposed by another state.

25

Q

Mrs. Renne, does the State of Californici have any
2

1

option when another state places a detainer on a prisoner who

2

is incarcerated in a California institution?

3

A

It does, Your Honor, under the agreement of — I

4

have to answer this question in two ways. Your Honor.

3

state is not a party to the agreement on detainers, then in

6

order for that prisoner to stand trial in another state requires

1

an executive agreement followed by extradition proceedings.

8

Clearly in this case the state has a reserve clause.

9

If another

Under the agreement on detainers a prisoner, if a prison

10

er invokes the agreement on the face of the statute, the State

U

of California is required to send that prisoner back to the

12

other state.

If, however, it is the other state that initiates

13

proceedings, there is a reserve clause detained by the Governor

14

may or the prisoner may disapprove and not be willing to go to

15
'16

17

IS
19
20

the other state.
We believe, Your Honor, that the answer to the first
question we have raised is clearly in the negative.

Court should, however, decide that habeus corpus relief is
presently available, then there is another question which is rais
by this case, and that is what is the appropriate forum in which

21

to bring an action of this kind?

22

the district of sentencing.

23

If the

The district of confinement or

The facts of this case are that, the petitioner below,

24

John Edward George, was in April of 1964 convicted upon his plea

25

of guilty to first‘degree robbery in the San Francisco Superior

!

Court,

2

indeterminate sentence law, that is, indeterminate to five years

3

to life sentence.

4

confined at San Quentin Prison and detainers were placed against

5

him by three states — the State of Kansas, the State of Nevada,

6

and the State of North Carolina.

He was sentenced to state prison and under the California

7

Following his conviction, the petitioner was

At this time North Carolina and California were parties

8

to the agreement on detainers which, as I have indicated, if a

9

prisoner seeks to stand trial in another party state, he may

10

invoke the procedures under the agreement, and that is what hap­

n

pened in this case.
Accordingly, in March of 1966, George was temporarily

12

13

released from custody in California to stand trial in North

14

Carolina.

15

February of 1967 in the North Carolina State Courts,

16

of 12 years to 15 years was imposed and, as George alleged below,

17

this sentence will not begin to run until he is in North Caro­

18

lina .

After one mistrial George was convicted of robbery in

George was returned to California in February of 1967

20

and .in September of 1967 the North Carolina Supreme Court affirmec

21

his conviction,

22

writ of habeus corpus in the U. S. District Court for the North­

23

ern District of California.

24
25

In December of 1967 George filed a petition for

His first petition was captioned John Edward George
versus the State of North Carolina, and the District Judge

4

1

dismissed the petition for failure to name proper party respond­

2

ent.

3

warden of San Quentin Prison, as an agent for the State of North

4

Carolina and naming the warden of North Carolina Prison "name

S

unknown."

Thereafter, George recaptioned his petition, naming the

6

Ultimately the District Court for the Northern District

7

of California dismissed the petition on the basis of this Court*

8

decision in McNally v„ Hill, under which the Court hack held that

9

a prisoner must be confined under the sentence he is seeking to

10

II

challenge in order to attain habeas corpus relief.
Thereafter, a certificate for probably cause to appeal

12

was granted by the District Court, but prior to opening briefs

13

being filed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals this Court's

U

decision in Peyton v. Rowe was decided.

15

this Court held that a Virginia prisoner could challenge the

IS

constitutionality of a consecutive sentence imposed by the Sta e

17

of Virginia.

13

And in Peyton v. Rowe

On the basis of Pevfcon v. Rowe George filed a motion ~ca
We were given noti ee

19

remand the proceedings to the District Court.

20

of the motion and as our first appearance filed an opposition to

21

the motion to remand and moved to dismiss the proceedings on the

22

grounds that Peyton v. Rowe should not be extended to the inter­

23

state case, that the California warden was not a proper party

24

respondent in this habeus corpus action, that a North Carolina

2,5

official who might be a proper party respondent was not before

not be obtained and, accordingly, the District Court, Northern

3

District of California, was without jurisdiction to proceed,
Q

4

S

Did you try to vouch, so to speak, or give notice

to the North Carolina authorities of this proceeding?
A

6

Yes, Your Honor — although it is not in the recorg

7

-— we have been in contact with North Carolina's Attorney General's

8

office since the inception of this case.

9

although it is not a matter of record -— but their position is

iO

that habeus corpus relief is net presently available in a case

11

of this kind.
Q

12

Their position is,

I suppose that is based on the theory that the

13

Court in California can have no jurisdiction over the State of

14

North Carolina?
A

15

That is correct, Your Honor.

They have not bean

16

served with process, we are not aware of any way in which they

17

could be.

18
19
20
21

Nevertheless, the Court below disagreed.
Q

Do you wnafc anything else, though, in this case

than that the California authorities cease giving any effect, or

j

recognition to the North Carolina judgment?
A

Well, it is our position that while we recognise

22

there is a conviction, we give no effect to it.

So that habeus

23

corpus relief is not presently available in any court.

24

take the position that it is only after this Court decides, whicl

25

we strongly urge that it not do, that there is custody within the

We do

j

1

meaning of habeus corpus statute, it is only then that this

2

Court need reach the question of what is the appropriate forum.
If it decides that custody is existent in this case, it

3
4

is only then it need decide whether --—

Q

S

Yes, but the threshold is the only issue between

Q

California and the prisoner — is the only issue whether Cali­

7

fornia authorities should continue to recognise the North Caro­

8

lina judgment?
A

No, Your Honor.

Q

Why?

A

The prisoner is seeking to set aside the North

12

Carolina conviction.

California authorities?

Why?

0

Well, there is no showing.

A

-- by the North Carolina conviction.

Q

But those were his allegations, weren't they?

A

What he said in the Court below was that the fact,

that there was a conviction outstanding assuredly affected his
parole.

As a matter of fact, that is not California policy and

we submitted a policy statement on the adult authority in the

Court below.

dence, primary place of residence, of the prisoner, we will

earlier than might otherwise be the case.
This case, Your Honor, this is our policy.

8
9

It is not

like Peyton v. Rowe, where in Peyton v. Rowe you had consecutive

10

sentences imposed by one state and there was a statute which

11

said that the sentences should be treated as one for purposes of

case.

You do not have that kind of statute in this

No, Your Honor.

Well, if you have an allegation and a complaint in

What happened is --

a petition that the 'North Carolina judgment does make a differ­

What happened, Your Honor, wa were not given notice

22

of the proceedings until the Ninth Circuit.

We filed an opposi­

23

tion to the motion to remand, stating that the only sentence
'

i

24
25

that this man was serving was a California sentence.
Q

Yes, but let us assume for the moment that it did
8

i

nake a difference, that his allegations were absolutely true,

2

that the detainer did make a difference in his treatment by the

3

California authorities to his harm.

4

srould state some kind of case for controversy between him and the-

5

Cali£ornia authoritie s?

Wouldn’t you think that that

6

A

No, Your Honor.

7

O

Why not?

8

A

Because, in order for habeus corpus relief to be

9

available, he must be in custody in violation of the sentence he

10

is seeking to challenge.

The California sentence was imposed in

11

1964.

12

tfas acquitted later in North Carolina or not.

Service of that sentence makes no difference whether he

prison policy in considering any charge or even a past conviction

22

If what he was challenging is the reasonableness of

the questions about whether or not the California imprisoning

7

authorities can consider the fact that the man has been convicted

in another state in determining whether or not he is eligible fox

8

3

you are also going to have to face the question as to the past

6

W

conviction situation, because if the prison authorities consider j

12

past convictions fully served in determining whether he maybe

12

is more likely to escape or whether he is eligible for minimum

13

custody, then the writ of habeus corpus, the business of the

14

Hourt, is going to be substantially expanded.

IS
16

17
IS
19

We think there is a decided difference between, where you
iave sentences lumped together by one state and where you are
calking about sentences imposed by another state.
Q

So you think the only issue in this case really is |

whether a prisoner detained in one state under a sentence by thatj

20

state may at any time, whether sentences of other states make any

21

lifference or not in his treatment by the prison, whether that

22

prisoner is in prison in State A, may raise it, in that state

23

;he validity of some convictions in State B that who has not

24

served yet, that is the issue?

25

A

Yes, Your Honor.
10

1

I would like to make clear that this case is not like a ]

2

sase where California has used the conviction of another state

3

as a prior conviction to increase the length of confinement or

4

bo render habitual confinement of statutes available.

5

lot this case at all.

6

Q

What if it were the case?

That is

Let us assume that the

7

SJorth Carolina conviction had been before the California convic- !

8

fcion and that conviction had been used by California as a basis

i

9

For habitual criminal conviction or to enhance sentencing and he

j

10

ras sent to jail in California and then he brings his writ of

11

labeus corpus to have declared unconstitutional the prior convic

12

bion of North Carolina.

13

A

Well, California, is itself clear, Your Honor, but

U

■/here this state is attempting to increase the length of statu­

15

tory service, then in California he may challenge the out-of-

16

state conviction.

17
18
19

20

0

Now how does this action go forward?

Does it go

Forward as to the extent evident in North Carolina is essential
witnesses from there are essential?

Both sides must get the

fitnesses there, don’t they?
1

21

A

It is a burden of proof on the state, Your Honor.

22

3ut in this case, Your Honor, California is attempting to use

23

;he conviction for their own purposes.

24

:o use the sentence of North Carolina for any purpose at all.

25

Q

But we are not attempting

You are, in effect, saying there is no case for

11

t'

controversy here at all between you and the prisoner?

2
3

A

That is part of the problem, Your Honor.

That ic;

part of the problem, but --

j

4

Q

What else are you saying?

S

A

Most importantly, Your Honor, we are saying that

6

Section 2241(c)(3) of the Federal Habeus Corpus statute provides

7

that the writ of habeus corpus shall not extend to a prisoner

8

unless he is in custody in violation of the Constitution.

S

in custody under the California sentence.

<0

He is

He is not challenging

that sentence.
That is why we say that custody under the habeus corpus

IS
12

statute is lacking.

S3

ticularly emphasized by the Court’s holding below that we are

14

the agents foir North Carolina.
Q

15

We think that the lack of custody is par­

Well, letting the Constitution and the law aside,

16

why didn't California turn him loose and let North Carolina feed

17

him?

18

A

Well, the record does not show what the facts are.

19

But the facts are that this man was given a parole date, an

20

earlier parole date, but there was a subsequent occurrence.

21

is a matter of dispute; the state says one thing and the prisoner

22

says another.

23

parole date was canceled.

24
25

Q

It

But there was another occurrence in which his

But I take it your position, is that the California

District Court has jurisdiction over the body but not the subject

matter.
A

Our position is, Your Honor, that the District

3

Court has jurisdiction over the prisoner for anything connected

4

with the California sentence.

5

the constitutionality of the California sentence.

But Mr. George has never challenged

6

Q

Well, he cannot challenge it in North Carolina.

7

A

No.

8
9
10

11
12

13

It is our position, Your Honor, that

—

excuse me, challenge California sentence in North Carolina?
0

No.

He cannot challenge the North Carolina sen-

fcence in North Carolina as long as he is in jail in California.
A

Well, he has not attempted to exhaust his state

remedies in North Carolina.
Now two of the issues ha has raised in his writ of habev

14

corpus in the California Court have already been determined by

15

the North Carolina Supreme Court.

IS

Q

But you don't want to rely on that, do you?

17

A

No.

Although we think certainly since he has nevei

18

made any attempt to have his third issue determined by the North

19

Carolina Supreme Court, then his petition below -- he first

20

alleged that the North Carolina sentence was imposed outside the

21

time limits provided by the agreement on detainers, so that the

22

North Carolina Court was without jurisdiction to proceed and

23

that was a deprivation of due process.

24
25

His second ground was also related to his right to a
speedy trial.

These were the two issues that the North Carolina
13

1

2

Court determined.
It was in his petition for writ of habeas corpus in

3

the California Court that he made the determination —- raised

4

the issue of knowing use of perjured testimony.

5

the practical difficulties of the Court's decision below empha­

6

size the lack of custody.

7

We think that

The Court has held that California is an agent for Worth

8

Carolina, but it is respectfully submitted that the agency could

9

note some sort of voluntary acceptance of authority, and we have

10

never assented to defending a North Carolina conviction.

What do you visualize — what is your ultimate

holding of the Court of Appeals, that the jurisdiction is in
California over this proceeding?
A

That is correct, Your Honor.

Q

What do you visualize happening when you come back

to the District Court?

Let me put a specific question to you.

Supposing California said to North Carolina, we give
you an opportunity to come in to defend and if you do not choose
to do so, we will erase the detainer.

Is that foreclosed under

the Court of Appeals decision?
A

Well, the Court of Appeals has never said exactly

what our obligation was -Q

No, but I am putting it to you.

What do you think

about California!s right to take that position vis-a-vis North

1

Carolina and say if you do not choose to come in, we have got no

2

quarrel with this man ourselves.

3

being attacked here.

4

choose to defend him, we will erase your detainer.

5

A

It is your judgment that is

He is in our custody, but if you do not

Well, certainly honoring of a detainer is a ques-

6

fcion solely of accommodation.

7

but even if we did not give effect to the detainer, there is an

8

interesting fact actually in this case, and that is that the

9

State of Kansas still has a detainer filed against this man and

10
11

the State of North Carolina knows that.
When and if this man is released, he could be released t

12

stand trial in Kansas.

13

preclude the State of North Carolina then going to Kansas.

U

As far as we know, there is nothing to

We can have their detainer honored there.

Or if that

15

result would be the result we did not honor the detainer, what

16

the Court actually would be asking us to do is give a greater

17

right to a detainer than we can give, or to review a conviction

18

which we can give in an extradition proceeding where an extra­

19

diction warrants, or where extradition proceedings are instituted

20

in the California Courts.

21

We cannot look at the underlying reasons for that

22

extradition warrant.

23

that under law.

24
25

I

We do net have to honor a detainer

It could be we disagree.

But we cannot do

We cannot look at the underlying facts.

And the Court below said that we could call upon the
North Carolina officials, but we are not so sure that they will

to come out.

Q

2

No. 1,

Could you just give them that opportunity and then

3

say if you don't care to come in, we are not taking the responsi­

4

bility for this?
A

5

6

We will remove your detainer.

I suggest, Your Honor, that if the man goes into

another state, North Carolina possibly could get -Q

7

But as far as California is concerned, by taking

8

that procedure and refusing to become the agent for North Caro­

9

lina in your own Court to defend their conviction of this man,

10

you say, "All right, if you do not want to come in, we are not
going to honor your detainer."

Wouldn’t you have the right to

do chat?

I think having in mind the con­

9

siderations which led this Court to its unanimous opinion in

10

Peyton v. Rowe two terms ago, we are here today to consider

11

whether or not respondent George is entitled to a timely and

12

therefore meaningful hearing on the constitutional claims that

13

he makes with respect to the North Carolina conviction.

I would say at the outset, however, that this decision

21

has been presented to four Courts of Appeal and in that number,

22

I think some IS judges, and none of those 16 who considered the

between Peyton and this case, particularly with regard to

Q

It is not only the fact that these are two states'
f

5

convictions which distinguishes this from Peyton, hut there is

6

one other distinction, and that is that in this case, unlike

7

Peyton against Rowe, the Court in which the petition for habeas

8

corpus was filed was not the Court where the person was confined,

9

which is a distinction, is it not, of some importance?

Do you

to

think perhaps it seems hyper-technical, but when I went to law

school, it was thought in order for a court to have habeus corpus

But part of this arrangement is to have something

more flexible than extradition, isn't it?
A

That is correct.

The respondent's application

under this detainer agreement to be released to North Carolina

17

for trial is deemed to be a waiver of extradition by him.

The agreement states that the warden of, in this case, Californie

Yes „

Well, if he didn’t discharge him, the prisoner woul

He certainly would.

At that point no authority,

I would think, would there be for the warden to hold him.

pose from the detainer agreement you could probably infer some so rfc

19

of authority for short time to accommodate the agents of Worth

21

I sup

Perhaps it would require that they show up on the

22

release day, so as to take him into their own custody immediately

23

as he passed through the gates of San Quentin.

24

but it would come perhaps to a split second.

Q

Well, if the Kansas one is first, then clearly

’our case is in trouble.
A

I suppose it is in this sense.

That if we remain

.n the situation where it is the workings discretion as to what

18

;o do about these detainers, that is, if we stay out of court,

cult situation.

But this is one of the reasons we would like to get this

G
9

A

Yes, he does.

He wants to attack it, may I say,

at a time in which he feels that his attack can be meaningful,

'10

that is, at a time when the evidence and witnesses and so forth

II

may be available to him.

12

Q

In California?

13

A

This obviously presents a problem to him.

This

14

relates to the second question that petitioner suggests is posed

15

in this case, and that is the appropriate forum.

1G

Under Ahrens against Clark, however, if there is any

17

relief available to him, it is only in the District Court he is

Now if —--

Q

Excuse me.

Almost ten years ago it so happens I

21

wrote an opinion for the Court which you may be familiar with,

enlightened and progressive piece of legislation.

state.
As I remember, however, it requires that the petitioner,

2
3

very much like Section 2255 of the United States Code, Title

4

XXVIII, if the petition is filed with the sentencing court, that

5

would be available to your client, wouldn't it or would it?

6

A

I am not sure that that is so.

7

Q

The North Carolina General Statutes, Section 15-217

8

through 222, I think.

Are you familiar with that?

0

A

I am not familiar with that.

10

Q

It would be well for you to become familiar with

11

that,

I think it would offer you a very easy way of relief in

12

this case.
A

13

It might very well.

14

I am familiar, however-, with the decision in Word again

15

North Carolina, which happened to involve the same state, and as

16

I recall, in that decision they suggested that post-conviction

17

relief was not available in North Carolina unless the petitioner

18

was physically incarcerated there.
If memory serves me correct, Chief Judge Haynasworth

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

on behalf of the Fourth Circuit invited the State of North Caro­
lina to reconsider this matter in light of Peyton against Rowe
and what it held with respect to the challenging of future sen­
tences.
Q

What is your controversy with the State of Cali­

fornici, with the warden particularly?
24

i

Let's assume for the moment that he was not doing anythin*

j1

2

to you now -- to your client now — and you had no anticipation

3

that he would on account of the North Carolina judgment.

4

still think you would have a dispute with him. with respect to the

5

validity of the North Carolina sector?

6

I don't really think we do have a dispute with

11

of some immediate impact as a result of this detainer, such as

12

heavier hand and so forth.

13

Q

Well, put that aside for the moment.

14

A

Yes, our dispute is this much.

He under the

15

detainer agreement and assuming that North Carolina is the

16

detainer first in line according to their own ways of resolving

17

this, and so forth, at the expiration of his current valid sen­

18

tence the warden proposes to release him to the custody of

19

North Carolina.

20

Q

Well, whenever he releases him, the Chief Justice

21

suggested North Carolina could be at the door and the same result

22

would obtain, and there is nothing the warden could do about it.

23

A

I think the answer for that is --

24

Q

You mean you want him just not give him notice?

25

A

No.
25

|

1

Q

Just cancel out with North Carolina?

2

A

No.

Ideally I would like to have the warden say

3

to North Carolina at that time,. "I have been ordered by the

4

United States District Court for the Northern District of Cali­

5

fornia, after a full hearing on the validity of your conviction,

6

to refuse to give this man to you.."
Q

7

0

Well, if North Carolina stayed outside the doors,

the warden would keep him in.
A

s

Is thait it?

I suppose that might be so.

I think the District

10

Court has the unquestioned power to fashion an order

11

directed to other California officials.
Q

12

bich is

!
Mr. Gumming, let me ask you about this unquestioned

13

power that you speak of.

14

of the California Federal Court to interfere with the State of

15

North Carolina picking up a prisoner at the end of his term in

16

California?
A

17

What would be the source of the power

The source of that power would be two-fold:

First

18

of all, it would be under the Court's obligation to consider

19

constitutional challenges that had been, raised to that North

20

Carolina conviction; and, secondly, I think it has been argued ir

21

briefs that there is no jurisdiction of the District Court in

22

California over the State of North Carolina.
Under the facts of this case, the circumstances of this

23
24

detainer agreement, I find that a difficult proposition to under­

25

stand .
26

O

1

Have you served any piece of paper to the State

2

of North Carolina?

3

A

Mo, we have not, except to the extent that the

4

Ninth Circuit below held that as a matter of law, Warden Nelson

5

is the agent of the State of North Carolina and actually nothing

8

has been served on Warden Nelson, because of course habeus cor­

7

pus is a little bit different than the usual plaintiff--defendant

8

aase.

9

The process is an order emanating from the District

10

lourt calling upon fche respondent to respond and show cause with

11

respect to the conviction, and we have never gotten that far.

12

Q

Well, then, no claim has been made by you,. I take

13

It, from the outset that the California warden is the agent of

14

the State of North Carolina?

15

A

No, we haven't.

Under fche detainer agreement he is

16

that state's agent for the enforcement of its rights under the

17

ietainer agreement, the rights as they now stand.

18

respondent wishes to challenge is violation by North Carolina

19

of the very provisions of that detainer agreement under which he

20

was tx*ied, to wit, the fact that he was not tried within the

21

mandatory time limit of that detainer agreement.

22

I suppose our position on merits, if we are allowed to get to

23

that, is that North Carolina simply lost the limited jurisdiction

24

over him that it had under the detainer agreement.

25

In part what

And, therefore,

Mr. Cumming, is your position that if you are denie

and again to Peyton v. Rowe.

It is quite true that respondent

has alleged some present impact of the detainer on him while he

11

is in California now.

12

Perhaps there isn't any or perhaps it can be ameliorated 9

13

he makes with respect to the North Carolina judgment at a time

when that hearing car. be meaningful and not — he is presently

16

serving an indeterminate sentence of five years to life, and so

17

he faces the same problem with respect to his second sentence

10

that Petitioner Rowe faced in Peyton against Rowe.

19

Q

Would it be unreasonable to say that the most

20

meaningful time to test that conviction was while he was still ir

when everything was fresh in the minds of everyone?

Q

1

2

What is the exact charge in the validity of the

orth Carolina judgment?
A

3

He makes three, Mr» Justice Black.

The first is

4

hat the detainer agreement by its terms requires that if a man

S

e taken to North Carolina to stand trial, that he must be tried

6

ithin, I believe, a 120-day period.

7

ying charge shall be dismissed.

And if he is not, the under

8

He was not tried within this period.

9

Q

Well, was that that if he was absent, they couldn’t

10

et him?

Do you mean that he is insisting that he was in jail

11

nd they could not get him out?
A

12

No, no.

Once he requests to be taken to North

13

arolina and is physically taken there to stand trial, then the

14

hate of North Carolina or any other party to this compact has a

15

imited period of time in which to try him and, indeed ---

16

Q

But he wasn not taken, was he?

17

A

Yes, he was.

Yes, he was in San Quentin Prison,

orth Carolina filed a detainer on an untried charge and Mr.

19

eorge was notified of this charge, and he has some rights under

situations where a man is incarcerated for many reasons.

Yes, he was taken to North Carolina.

At that time?

A

At that time and tried and convicted, and immediate

5

6

returned to California»
Q

So the answer --

What are you charging now?

I wouldn't suppose

7

that would — you are not charging anything unconstitutional

0

about that, are you?

9
10

A

The fact that he was not tried within the time

limit that --

11

Q

How long did it take?

12

A

I aril not sure.

How long was it?

It took longer than the mandatory

13

time provision of the detainer agreement.

It seems to me the

14

detainer agreement provides for 120 days after ha arrived in

IS

North Carolina.

16

Q

That is under North Carolina law?

17

A

No —- well, yes, this is North Carolina law to the

10

extent that this is represented by this detainer compact which

19

has been signed by a number of states and provision --

20
21

Q

Did you carry that question to the Supreme Court

of North Carolina?

22

A

Yes, he had.

23

Q

And they decided against you under their law •—

24

A

On their lav?.

25

Q

What is your other question?
30

1

A

The second question would be notwithstanding the

2

violation — the precise violation of this time period, it may

3

be that the delay represents a denial of a speedy trial under

4

the Sixth Amendment, and his third claim is that he was convicted

5

on the basis of testimony known by the prosecution to be perjuri­

6

ous .
Those are his three contentions.

7

They may all be with­

8

out merit, but we have never had a hearing on that and we would

9

like to have it.

10

I beg your pardon?

11

Q

Do you want to try that question in California?

12

A

Under Ahrens v. Clark at this time that is the only

13

place we can try it.

And we will have some difficulty trying

U

it there, but we will have a lot more difficulty if we have to

15

go back to North Carolina and try it 10 years from now, or 20

16

years from now, or 30 years from now.

17

It will be impossible.

13

Q

If he alleged that this North Carolina conviction

19

were being used some way by the California authorities as bearinc

20

on his time for release under the California conviction, that

2?

there is a remedy in the California State Courts for a claim like

22

that.

Do you agree with that?

23

A

I believe that to be the lav?.

24

Q

Well now, if that is the lav?, there is an allega­

25

tion, as I understand it here, that that is what is happening,
31

i

that the California authorities are using this North Carolina

2

conviction with prejudice.

3

habeus corpus proceeding could not be entertained until there

4

had been an exhaustion of state remedies.

1 thought ordinarily that a Federal

5

A

That is quite correct.

6

Q

Why, then, would not this proceeding be premature

7

in the Federal Courts since I gather there has been no effort

0

to get a proceeding in the California. State Court?
A

9

It may very well be premature.

I am not — franlc.lv f

10

we were associated in this case when it was in the Ninth Circuit

11

Court, and we were perhaps a little less familiar than what we

32

might be with the arguments that we would make if we had some

13

basis to get into the district.
Q

14

Well, if on the record it comes to us, it would

15

appear that he has not. exhausted his remedies and I don't what

16

has happened below.

17

and send it back, pending his going to the California State

18

Court?

We just vacate everything that has happened

19

A

I don't think so, because -—-

20

Q

Why not?

21

A

Because we are also concerned not with -—

22

Q

The statute makes it. clear, does it not?

23
24
25

The

Federal Courts cannot, entertain a Federal habeus until than there
is an exhaustion and a presently available remedy in the State
Court.

Isn't that correct?
32

1

A

That is correct.

I think that the proceeding

2

ought not be vacated for this reason.

We are not only concerned

3

with present facts as there may be, that is, holding him with a

4

heavier hand, the things that 1 believe Mr. Justice White men­

S

tioned a few moments ago.

6

Q

But doesn't that suggest ---

7

A

But we are also concerned with challenging the

8
9

validity of the North Carolina -Q

Well, doesn't that then raise another question

10

that Mr. Justice Stewart put to you?

If there has to be exhaus­

11

tion of any available state remedies before any Federal Court

12

can entertain habeus, may there not be in North Carolina a post­

13

conviction remedy which has not yet been exhausted?

14

A

I don't believe so.

15

Q

That the state would require them to exhaust before

IS
r;

the Federal Court can entertain this application?
A

That is correct, but I believe that there is no

18

such remedy.

19

I recall, the law there in North Carolina was that you had to be

20

physically in custody in North Carolina.

21

As I mentioned, in Word against North Carolina, as

The Fourt Circuit invited North Carolina to reconsider

22

that matter, although I have trouble with that because the sfcafcutfe

23

speaks in terms of remedies available at the time of the peti-

24
25

Q

Well, your answer to me is there is no North

1

2
3
4

Carolina proceeding?
A

So far as I know,, they have not modified their law

under the suggestion of the Fourth Circuit.
Q

Mr. Gumming, suppose the State of California agreed

B

and says we will lift the detainer, and then sends a telegram

6

that tells him he will be released on such and such a date.

7

can you do about that?

8
S

A

What

1 suppose we would have to apply to the then-

appropriate court to require that no one else in California

10

assist — in other words, as I understand your question, you are

11

asking me what would we do if the warden gave us voluntarily the

12

sort of relief that we are seeking in the District Court?

13

Q

My specific question was:

If the warden releases

14

the detainer and sends a collect, telegram, so it won't cost Cali­

15

fornia any money, to the State of North Carolina and says we

16

will release Joe Bloke 11 o'clock at the east gate, what could

17

you do about it?

10

A

I suppose we would have to, as I said, apply to an

19

appropriate court to prevent anyone from Californici in assisting

20

North Carolina in attaining custody.

21

North Carolina —-

22

Q

Wait a minute.

Under what law could you prevent

23

somebody from notifying another state that they are getting read}

24

to release a prisoner?

25

A We couldn't prevent the notification.

No, we could not prevent the notification.

You couldn't do a thing about that.

That's right.

basis to appeal to the Executive of the State of California for

consideration for consideration. Extradition habeus corpus may
■
be limited, an extradition proceeding may be a very short one.

13

But he has some basis to appeal to someone to give some considera­

14

tion to his claim that the North Carolina sentence is invalid.
At the present time he has none, because he has waived

15

extradition.

there, he stood trial and in the interim he is asking them to

That is entirely right.

Let me try a little variation of Mr. Justice Mar­

Suppose not California, but North Carolina voluntarily

Is it waived?

It is just that we withdraw the detainer.

Well,, then, I suppose he does not go to North

Q

Well, he waives the detainer.

That doesn't prevent

i

them from having three deputy sheriffs from North Carolina sitting
autside the east gate to pick him up.
A

That's right.

But they would have to go through

But, as I say, at least

it that point he would have some recourse.

I don't think it does.

Your Honor, if I may briefly respond to

two primary points.

Well, I took that position from the --

That, is correct, Your Honor.

Is there an allegation here that it was relieved?

No, Your Honor.

But that is a totally

The record doesn't support it and, in fact,

we don't think the record-- 38

Q

1

Well, even though that is not true, isn’t it an

2

ordinary habeus practice in the Federal District Court out your

3

way that would ask the very first question, have you exhausted tl e

4

state remedies?

5

A

Oh, yes, that is true, Your Honor*.

6

Q

Well, why wasn't that done in this case?

7

A

Because, Your Honor, exhaustion of state remedies

0

10

presupposes the applicability of present habeus corpus relief.
The issue raised in the Court below was, is there presently
available habeus corpus relief?

And it is our position --

Yes, but that is — I thought ordinarily the posi­
that

there isn't presently available Federal habeus

relief until you have established that you have exhausted all
your state remedies that ‘are presently available.
A

Well, we do think in this instance. Your Honor,

that there hasn't been any showing of an attempt to exhaust.
Q

But I come back, then, why shouldn't this case go

10

back to the District Court for initial determination now, whether

19

he has available state remedies, xvhether in California or in

20

North Carolina?

21

A

Because that presupposes there is some sort of

22

habeus corpus jurisdiction in the District Court of California,

Your Honor, and we are unwilling — we don't believe that that is

correct law.

We think that it may be that this inmate has a

in the State Court.

4

That is our position.

And we think there has been no showing that he has

5

attempted to do that.

But we don’t think there is presently

available Federal habeus corpus relief.

I

I would like to make clear, too, in response to some of

7

the other questions asked, that we will not hold a man one day

longer on tide strength of a detainer.

obtain an extradition warrant.
The prisoner can waive extradition.

That is a different

In the parole situation there are two separate ways

that the man might be paroled.

17

Now if that other state does not come in with exfcraditi gn

Assuming jurisdiction here for the moment, what do

8

you think about the Court of Appeals suggestion that if it came

9

down to a question of venue witnesses, that 1404(a) transferring

10

11

140(a) would be available?
A

Well, Your Honor, as I recall Section 1404(a),

12

that transfer statute says that the. case may be transferred to

13

an action where it might have been brought.

14

that this case could not have been brought in another forum.

15

It is our position

Now it is true that Word v. North Carolina, Fourth

16

Circuit opinion decided that the sentencing court was not an

17

appropriate forum in a case of this kind.

10

fortuitous that in both cases North Carolina conviction should

19

be involved.

20

But it is really

In any other circuit this wouldn't be the case, the

21

other recent case being the Third Circuit case in Van Scoten

22

versus Pennsylvania where the Third Circuit held that New Jersey

23

prisoners couldn't challenge future Pennsylvania sentences in a

24

Pennsylvania court.

Q

Have you looked into the North Carolina post-convietior

41

remedy statute?

2

A

Well, 1 have read it, Your Honor.

3

Q

It seems to be applicable only to those imprisoned

4

5

in North Carolina.
A

Would you agree with that?

On the face of it, Your Honor, that does seem to

6

be the case.

7

lature would be willing to change its mind.

8

if the proper case ever arose in North Carolina, that there could

9

be some sort of reading of the North Carolina statute to encompas

a case of this kind.
There has never been that kind of an attempt that we

That brings us back to the exhaustion point that

Mr. Justice Brennan was raising.

15

A

Well, it is a kind of --

16

Q

He has an obligation to try to see if the North

17
18

Carolina procedures will reach him.
A

It is a kind of exhaustion. Your Honor.

As I under

19

stand exhaustion in the technical sense, it does presuppose some

20

sort of present habeus corpus relief.

21

don’t think the law requires that.

22

We are unwilling — we

We do think that as far as equities of the situation

23

are concerned, that the prisoner ought to make an attempt in

24

North Carolina to get some sort of relief there.
