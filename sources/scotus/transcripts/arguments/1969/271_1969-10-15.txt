on United States against Minor.

The Second Circuit

was not an. inherently suspect illegal business.
This was not a statute designed to close down criminal]
activity but, rather, to regulate a legitimate activity.
Briefly, the Marijuana Tax Act statutory scheme con­
sists of an occupational tax provision, series of provisions,

requiring any transferor of marijuana, anyone who deals in
marijuana, which is defined very broadly and includes selling
it and giving it away, to register as a dealer, to pay an occuj

pational tax, and to keep a record of his transactions.
There is also a transfer tax provision which requires
a transferee, a purchaser or acquirer of marijuana, to obtain
an order form from the Treasurer of the United States.

He must :

pay in advance the tax on the material to be acquired.

The tax:

is either at the rate of $1 an ounce or $100 an ounce, depending,
on 'Whether the transferee is himself registered.

He pays the

tax based upon the amount ha intends to acquire,
- 3
v

1

In order for him to acquire that order form, he must

2

place on file with the Government, prior to obtaining the form,

3

and prior to consummating the transaction, his own name and

4

address and the name and address of his proposed transferor, as

5

well as the amount of the drug he proposes to transfer»

6

There are numerous exemptions from the order form re­

7

quirement and, as the Court noted in Leary, they are essentially

10

pursuant to doctors5 orders, by officials of the Government,

1!

and transactions for export, so there is left subject to the

12

order form requirement a residual class essentially illegal

13

tra nsactions.
The information obtained by the order form, copies of

14

15

the order form, are made available to any State of local offi­

16

cial who is concerned officially with the enforcement of local

17

narcotics laws.
Possession of marijuana is illegal in every State of

Q

And pay $100 an ounce.

9

A

And pay $100 an ounce? yes, sir.

10

The Leary case involved such a purchaser.

The Leary

11

case held that the marijuana statute, the transfer provisions,

12

as applied to an unregistered transferee, who was Leary, applied

13

to a person inherently suspect of criminal activities and

14

existed in an area permeated with criminal statutes v particu­

15

larly by virtue of the exposure of the information contained on

16

the order form to the State authorities.

17

18
19
20
21

22

It held, therefore, that the privilege against seif”
incrimination applied.

The Court in Leary -also refused to sever

the statute so as to make the order form applicable but with­
draw the information from the perusal of the State.
It also applied the privilege against self-incrimi­
nation to prospective acts, sines in the Leary case the pur­
chaser acquired the order form prior to the time that any trans-j

23
24
25

action was consummated.
Petitioner here contends that the Leary reasoning

I

applies fully to the position of a transferor of marijuana.

2

Under the same order f-.na procedure, the acts required of the

3

transferor,, in order to comply with the provisions of 4742,

4

yield an even greater danger than they did to the transferee of

5

marijuana.

Q

As you point out, this is a form quite different

from the one in the last case, in that the seller's name is on

it when it comes from the Government, isn't it?

3
4

A

That is correct.

In addition, the general struc­

ture of the form is a directive to the transferor —

him, so far as the Federal act is concerned, to transfer a cer­

I suppose, though, if the buyer goes to a fellow

In addition, he is required by the statute to retain the piece

of paper, which constitutes an additional piece of evidence of

his criminal act, for two years, and to make it available to

22

Q

23
24
25

Which precise statutory provision, of the ones

contained in your appendix, has this man been convicted of
violating?
9

1

A

2

Q

4742.

3

A

That is right.

4742.

4742(a) is the general require-

4

raent that you may not transfer marijuana except pursuant to an

5

'order form.

6

Q

7

8

Do you assert that there is anything wrong with

that just as a provision in the statute?
A

Insofar as the

mechanism, for obtaining the order

9

form is provision (c) and (d) of 4742„ and insofar as the order

10

form requires that information, ha on file which is incriminating

at the time —

12

13
14

Q

Do you say the Fifth Amendment bars the Govern­

ment from prohibiting sales except on order forms, just as such?
A

The use of the order form by itself,

no.

If thi

15

were to be an order form of the sort contained in the Narcotic

IS

Drug statutes, than we would not feel that the seller would be

17

incriminated by requiring that such an order form exist.

18

theory of it in the narcotic drug case is, I believe

19

order form requirement is to see to it that unlawful people do

20

not obtain narcotic drugs.

But in this case the order form does require that the
name and address of the transferor be in the hands of the

Government prior to the sale.
Q

Suppose he gets the order form and fills it out.

Has he incriminated himself if he does nothing more than that?
A

The transferor does not obtain the order form

5

and does not fill it out.

6

form and fills it out,

7

Q

8

The transferee obtains the order

Right, and if he takes the order form and fills

it out and does nothing more —

9

A

Has the transferor incriminated himself?

10

Q

Have either been incriminated?

11
12

The incrimination

is when you sell the drugs, isn't that right?

A

The information in the hands of the Government

23

directs the attention of the Government to a group of people

n

who are suspect, and very strongly suspect, of criminal activity.

15

Even the focus of their attention —

16

20
zt

23
24
25

Q

If they don't engage in this criminal activity,

are they injured?
A

They would presumably then be able to. refute the \

implication that arises from, the existence of the order form.
Q

How is the filling out of the blank, in and of

itself, "without more, incriminating?
A

I think there is a very heavy presumption, that

that blank would not be filled out were the transaction not
going to be completed.

Among other things, the tax must be

paid prior to filling out of the form? that is, you cannot
11

1

obtain the form without paying the tax.

2

’

3

4

Q

To use a phrase we sometimes use, what 15 trigger s'

all of it is the buying or selling of the marijuana.
A

Yes.

If one were not interested in buying or

5

selling marijuana, one would not deal with these forms at all»

6

However, the danger, the suspicion engendered by the existence

7

of the form, is such that the existence of the form, I think,

8

would cause the attention of the authorities to bs focused very

9

closely on these people.

to
11
12
13
14

Q

Isn't it the paper, the form, the filling out of

the form, plus an overt act that makes the criminal offense hero?
A

The offense is the overt act, or the overt act

in the absence of the piece of paper.■
Q

But as Justice Marshall just suggested, the piece

15

of paper alone, filled out and signed, doesn’t incriminate the

18

man at all, does it?

17

A

If the transaction were to have gone no further

18

than that, then I believe it would be incriminating in that the !

19

statute provides that the piece of paper may be used as evidencej

20

and the existence of the piece of paper may serve to bring into

21

initiation the process of prosecution in relation to a drug.

.

£2

Presumably the transferor who did not transfer, but

23

is simply named as a transferor, would be able to testify that

24

he did not, in fact, ever commit any acts of this sort, and were

25

h© to be believed, then —

12

i
i

i

2

Q

about it at all if all he did was fill out the form?
A

3
4

S

Would there be any occasion for him to testify

this case»

j

The transferor does not fill out the form in
The transferee only fills out the form»

Q

l am talking about the transferee now.

If the

6

transferee just fills out the form, on Justice Marshall's

7

hypothetical, and puts it in the drawer of his desk, ha has

8

committed no offense, has he?

9

A

This Court, in Leary, considered that the cor­

10

relation between the act of filling out the form and the act of

u

selling or buying the drug was so close that it viewed the

•12

existence of the form as being evidence of being a recent

13

transferee of marijuana, even though the existence of the form

14

did not necessarily imply that any transaction had been corn-

15

plated at all.

16

17

Q

What we have in Appendix 8 is what is issued by

the Treasury Department.

18

A

That is correct,

19

Q

In order to get that issued to him, a prospective

20
21

22
23
24
25

would-be transferee has to make an application for it, I assume.
A

That is correct.

Q

In the application, does he give the name of the j

prospective vendor?
A

Yes, he does.

Q

What is to prevent him from just putting George
13

i
2

Washington or Abraham Lincoln or Charles Evans Hughes in there?
A

Nothing, except that l believe one has to assume

3

that the process, if it is to be followed, is going to be fol­

A

lowed as required by the statute»

S

is nothing to prevent him from skipping the order form com­

6

pletely, but one would assume that, in obeying the law, he is

7

going to do what the statute says.

As a matter of fact, there

the proposed vendor.
Q
What in the world is to prevent him from putting |

16
17

down there Earl Warren, or Pd.chard M. Nixon, or Edmund Muskie?

18

A

Nothing.

19

Q

And that is not self-incrimination, is it? if he

20

is incriminating anybody, it is Edmund Muskie, as a potential,

21

prospective, possible vendor.

22
«3«»
6*>kJ

A

That is correct, but 1 think we have to assume

that this is a process that people will follow, if they are
.

24
25

going to follow it at all, in the way that it is required.
Q

Why is it required?

14

The requirement there is

i

1

that you put down nothing except a name and address of somebody,

A

2

That is right.

Now, if the proposed transferor

S

accepted this order form, he is acknowledging the truth of the

4

information contained on the order form, that is, that he, the

5

prospective, the proposed transferor, has transferred to this

6

transferee the specified quantities of marijuana.

1

he has committed a self-incriminatory act.
In addition, he must retain that form for two years

S

9

At that time

to serve as further evidence..
In connection with obtaining the order form, the Leary

10

11

case held that an unregistered transferee is protected against

12

obtaining the order form because it is self-incriminatory for

13

him to do so.

H

transferee will obtain the order form to give to the transferor

13

He must see to it that the piece of paper exists

ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH J. CONNOLLY, ESQ,

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

3
4

MR, CONNOLLY;

Mr, Chief Justice;, and may it please

the Court;

5

In the light of the preceding discussion of the prirr-

6

ciplies applicable here and in Minor, our brief submission will

7

focus on the Government0s view of the statute in this case, and

8

our response to the central features of petitioner's argument.

8

Petitioner contends that Section 4742(a), which simply

10

requires that he receive from his transferee an order form

?1

Which the transferee shall obtain, in some way compels him to

12

make incriminating disclosures to the Government,

13

that his contention seeks to establish much more than the

14

words of the statute or its operation in fact can support.

13

We believe

The offense defined by Section 4742(a) does not make

16

criminal petitioner's failure to report any previous misconduct

17

to the Government, nor does the order form provision require

13

him to make incriminating disclosures to the Government in ordei

19

to legalise his subsequent conduct.

20

t '

The transferor is neither required nor entitled to

21

apply for an order form from the District Director,

22

duty which this statute imposes on the petitioner is to trans­

23

fer marijuana only to those persons who have made their acqui­

24

sition lawful by paying the tax and receiving an order form.

25

.The only

The statute punishes not a failure to disclose
20

i

information but a transfer, a transfer to someone who does not

2

demonstrate that he has complied with Federal lav'?.

o«2»

position that the statute on its face and in practice can be

4

complied with without the transferor's disclosing any informa­

tion at all„
Petitioner's argument to the contrary is found in that
he asserts to be the practical consequences of the statute«

lie

notes that the transferee must provide the name and address of
the transferor

in his application for an order form.

He then

assumes that the transferee can obtain that information only
from the transferor himself.
This assumption is essential to the success of
petitioner's argument for it provides the aspect of self“incrimi­
nation which is lacking on the fact of the statute.

Unless it

can be said that the transferee necessarily must obtain that
information from the transferor, it cannot be said that compli­

ance with the statute infringes the transferor's right to refrain
n
from making incriminating disclosures.
m

19
20
21

The petitioner offers no support for this assumption
on which his argument rests.

If he is relying on common expert-

ence to justify the assumption, such experience in our view
refutes the assumption as evidenced by the many cases like this

2t
one in which a purchaser who may be previously unknown to a
seller of marihuana is introduced to him by a friendly inter­

24
mediary who can supply the name of the transferor.

25
21

We also think it is appropriate.fco point out that this

I

a

case seems to he a most unlikely vehicle to establish as a

3

Constitutional principle a doctrine that a transferee of mari­

4

huana can learn the name and address of the seller only from

S

the seller himself.
The facts in this case show that some 10 days before

6
1
8
9

the transaction on which he was convicted petitioner sold a
quantity of marihuana to narcotics agents in the kitchen of
his apartment.
Petitioner would have the Court conclude that there

IS
13
20

21
22
23

was no way except from the petitioner himself that the agents
,

could have learned his narae prior to the second transaction.
But we think it needs no argument that persons who sell mari­
huana in the kitchens of their homes are poorly situated to
.

conceal their names and addresses.
By basing his argument on assumptions as to the practi­
cal effect of the statute, petitioner emphasizes the critical
difference between this case and Leary and its ahticedents.

In

each of those cases, the statute on its face imposed on the
petitioner himself an obligation to supply certain information.
There was only one way the petitioner in those cases could
comply with the statute — by supplying the information himself.
In the present case, it is clear that the transferor
I
can comply fully and literally with the statute where he receives

24
an order form for which he gave no information at all.
25
22

1

In his oral argument,» petitioner makes the additional

2

contention that even if ho did not supply any information to

3

the transferee to enable the transferee to obtain the form that

4

the mere fact that, he receives an order form thus obtained by

5

the transferee is an incriminatory act; that is, I think the

6

language that he uses, that he adopts the language on the form.

7

We submit in response to that contention that there

a

is no increimination, htere is no disclosure upon receipt of

9

the form at all.

ID

Q

The petitioner is —-

Would it be an offense under 4742(a) for a man

li

named.John Smith to see marihuana to somebody pursuant to an

12

order form in which the top name was Robert Jones?

13

A

I inquired with lawyers more knowledgeable with

14

the operation of the statute concerning that question, and the

15

answer is not entirely clear.

16
17
18
19
20

21
22

If you will look at Section 4742(d) in the statute,
the third sentence says, "The original shall in turn be given
by the transferee to any person who shall in pursuance thereof
transfer marihuana to him.w
Thus the statute on its face does not prohibit a
transferor from making a transfer pursuant to a form in which
his own name is not listed as the transferor.

As far as I know,

and 1 asked, there has never been any prosecution brought assert­
23
24

2S

ing that that is a violation of the order form requirements.
Q

That is a highly unlikely factual situation.

23

1

except that it does go I think to the petitioners argument a

2

little bit,

3

h

That is right.

In the real world, in the lawful

4

world of marihuana order forms, it is unlikely that a transferee

5

applying for a lav/ful order form will change his mind and submit

6

it to some other supplier of marihuana.

7

that.

So we don't often see

But I think that the Government can confidently assert

8

that the statute on its face would not preclude a transferor

9
10

from transferring if the order formwas not addressed directly

•11

to him.

12

the transferor was a prior party to a misstatement on the appli­

13

cation for an order form# but 1 think that is far afield of what

14

you were asking.

This I take it would exclude the situation in which

Q

IS

fhe duty to put the seller's name on is placed

16

A

17

That is right.

The District Director puts the

18

name "bn the form and he learns the name because it appears on

19

the transferee’s application.

5

Q

6

A

No, it does not, because there is no compulsion

9

Q

Well, there shouldn't have been in Leary then»

10

A

In our view of the practical consequences of the

n

illicit dealings with marijuana, in any case in which an order

12

form may be tendered to an illicit transferor, like petitioner,

13

the most reasonable assumption, contrary to petitioner's assump­

14

tion, is that none of the. information was supplied for that

15

purpose by the transferor.
It is, to be sure, difficult to assess assumptions on

16
17

either side of the case in this area because it is so very

18

unlikely that an illicit transferor will ever be presented with

19

an order form.

20

no reason, so far as we know, to acquire marijuana on the illici t

21

market.

22
23
24
25

The 160 registered handlers of marijuana have

The far more numerous unregistered consumers are
hardly likely to secure order forms.

The cost of incriminating j

themselves and payisg $100 tax, when their failure to pay the
tax and to acquire marijuana pursuant to an order form, is not
27

;

1

punishable under Leary, so it is quite easy to say suppose there

2

is s. transferee who wants to acquire marijuana from an illicit
:

3

seller, and who is willing to acquire an order form for that

4

purpose, but it is very difficult to translate that supposition

5

into a factual hypothetical which makes sense in the real world.,

0

Even if we were willing to accept that supposition,

7

however, and to accept the further doubtful precise that a

8

transferee of marijuana could acquire an order form — that is,

9

whether the District Director could lawfully issue an order

10

form addressed to an illicit transferor —

2

Q

So a person need not be registered in any way to

!

3

be a purchaser,- but a person needs to be registered to be a

A

5

That is right.

On that basis, we suggest in our

6

brief that there is a serious question whether the District

7

Director will or could issue an order form to Peter Strauss to

8

acquire marijuana from Joseph Connolly,, when Joseph Connolly's

9

transfer would be unlawful under another provision of the

statute.

What, in fact, happens when an application conies

Q

They might be transferors in its broadest sense.
It isn’t really selling, is it?

It is selling,

transferring, and several other terms.
A

The statute which prohibits unregistered traffick

ihg in marijuana, has a list of various activities., dealing in,
selling, giving away.

Section 4742 and 4741, which imposes the

tax, speaks of a transfer which the statute defines as any ex­
change of possession except —•
30

1

2

Q

Would that include a physician giving it to a

patient or a research center?

h

3

That is right.

That would be a transfer?
That is a transfer under the

4

statute, exempted from the order form and the transfer tax re­

S

quired .

6

To continue on with the question whether the transfero

7

is likely to supply any information to the transferee in order

8

to enable the transferee to get an order form,, we think that

9

any assumption along those lines contradicts the sailer’s basic

10

instinct to avoid having this transaction coma to the attention

'i!

of the Government at all.

12

It is virtually impossible for us to conceive of a

13

situation in which a. transferor would cooperate with a trans­

14

feree who had expressed an intention to get an order form.

IS

would not expect Mr. Diamond to deny that for an illicit trans­

16

feror in petitioner’s position an order is just about the last

n

thing that he wants» and if a transferee does produce an order

18

form which he can and might have obtained without the knowledge

19

of the transferor, we believe that the transferor would undoubt­

20

edly would refuse to complete the transaction pursuant to that

21

form because it would be subject to intense scrutiny.

22

We

If that is true, then we see no reason to believe

23

that an illicit transferor would, as a means of complying with

24

this statute, provide any information to his transferee.

25

short, we conclude that this statute does not impose upon the

31

In

i

transferor of marijuana any duty to make an, incriminating dis­

2

closure whichr then; is transmitted to the Government.

3

I think that is the significant difference between

4

this case and Leary? that whatever characterization you might

S

want to give to the transferor's consummating the transaction

6

pursuant to this document; that act involves no matter communi­

7

cated by him or by the transferee to the Government»

8

9

Q

I understood that the law said that no seller

shall sell on an order form unless he writes his name on the

10

order form,

A

He has put himself in the position of being re­

2

quired to acknowledge it to the various State officials who come

3

around as a result of that order form.

4
5

Q

Because that is a separate obligation, to keep

the order form in his possession, on file.
A

6

I believe it is the obligation to which this

1

statute looks? that is, the purpose of the buyer's name on the

8

order fora is to deal with the second purpose stated in the

9

legislative history of this Act, that is, to expose all details

10

of marijuana transactions to the scrutiny of both Federal and

!!

State officere.

12

If the purpose of this transfer provision was only to

13

prevent transfers to unlawful people, the buyer's name would be

14

irrelevant.

iS

buyer to all scrutiny which may follow the. coming into existence

m

of the order form.
I believe that there cannot be any segregation of this

17
18
19

20
21

The purpose is to expose the seller as well as the

statute -—
Q

Would the statute require him to disclose this

information to anybody who comes around?
A

To any official, 'State,local, or Federal official

22

who comes around.

23

It. would be frivolous, I think, to say something like
■
at that point ha need not expose it. There would be no purpose

24
25

He must produce his copy of the order form.

in his having to take it in the first place if he didn't have fcc
35

1

display it when the officials come around,, since this serves

2

more than the possibly valid purpose of seeing to it that these

3

drugs- go only to legitimate purchasers.

4

the seller is also exposed to official scrutiny, and that is

5

dons by seeing to it that he maintains a copy which he reveals

6

to appropriate ~
Q

7

They see to it that

You say the law says to him, "If you want to sell

8

any narcotics which may he legal under Federal law, but illegal

9

under State law, the Federal law tells, you that you must make a

10

record

n

than if a State official asks you for the record, you have to

"12
13

of

this sale, illegal under State law, preserve it, and

disclose itc’?
J

A

That is correct.

We feel that is the fruition

14

of the entire sailer information of the transfer order pro­

15

visions of the Marijuana Act.

16

Q

Let's clip that in pieces, now.

Suppose he had

17

the record, but when the State officer called on him and asked

18

for its exhibition, he simply stood on his claim of the Fifth

19

Amendment and declined to do it and proceeded to test it out?

20
21

22
23

24
25

A

I think that that would be rendering the entire

transfer provisions prointless.

There is no point to him fcakinc

the order form at all, since the buyer part of it is already
taken care of by- the buyer's name.

If the sailer's point is to

have any purpose, it is to expose and reveal the seller.
If the seller -were to decline to disclose the order

1

form and he were sustained on that, there would he no point in

2

making him take the order form in the first place.
Q

3

Aren't you suggesting that the Federal Government

4

has no legitimate interest in knowing the sources independent

5

of the prosecutorial aspect, but simply knowing the flow of the

6

material?
A

7

They perhaps do , but they may not make the man

8

incrirain&fce himself in relation to that legitimate interest.

9

They require him to register and maintain records of a different

10

sort and under different provisions of this law, and those pro­

11

visions are perhaps valid, but they cannot then require that he„

12

in effect, commit another crime by refusing to reveal that he

13

has violated the first provisions.
We feel this case comes directly under the Albertson,

14
15

Marchetfci, Leary line.
In addition, the order forms are all used as evidence.

16
17

The statute describes them as such.

18

Thank you. Your Honor.
