S

ORAL ARGUMENT BY FRANK X. FRIEDMANN, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS■

6

7

MR. FRIEDMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

3

the Court:

Due to the intricate litigation which is the

9

background of this case, and the complex factual setting, as

10

well as the unique procedural vehicle which was employed by

11

the Respondent. Brotherhoods below, we will, with the Court's

12

permission, make first a separate and distinct statement of

13

the facts and of the procedural setting in this easewhich

14

will'"then be followed by Mr. Lyons' argument of the law as

15

applied to those facts.

16

First, the background and the physical setting which

17

we are dealing with.

Physically we are dealing with the

18

property of three separate railroad carriers.

19

Florida East Coast Railroad.

20

is located in large part in the south of the St. Johns River

21

in Jacksonville,, Florida, although it is bounded on the north

22

by the north bank of the St. Johns River.

First, the

The Florida East Coase property

23

The second parcel of property we are dealing with is

24

located to the north of the FEC property and that property is

25

of the Jacksonville Terminal facility.
3

Thirdly, the property which is directly involved

1
2

here is the Moncrief Yard? located again, north of the

3

Jacksonville Terminal.Company,
Now, the background, and in highly capsule form, if

4
5

I may.
In January of 1963 the FEC nonoperating employees

6

7

went on strike and began to picket the FEC property.

8

of 1966 these pickets moved up the line and across the St.

9

Johns River and began to picket the Jacksonville T rminal

to

Property.

11

picketing, both of which came before this Court.

12

In May

Two series of litigations resulted from that

First, the Jacksonville Terminal Company sought an

13

injunction and was granted an injunction in Federal Court.

14

That injunction was reversed, due to the Bar of Norris-

15

Laguardia by the Fifth Circuit and this Court affirmed, 4-4.

16

SEcondly, the Jacksonville TErminal. Company sought

17

an injunction in state court.

That injunction was granted and

18

in March of last year this Court reversed by a 4-3 decision.

19

In the meantime, however, and in April of 1967, FEC

20

pickets again moved up the line and placed pickets around the

21

ACL9s Moncrief Yard.

22

involved in this case, is a wholly-owned piece of property, or

23

a piece of property wholly owned by the ACL, which is devoted

24

primarily to classification and secondary to the interchange

25

of traffic with connecting carriers.

Moncrief Yard, the facility which is

4

1

Classification# as the term implies# is a simple act

2

of breaking down a roadtrain which comes into the yard# putting

3

it into its separate classes and putting it into a roadtrain

4

which goes out of the yard.

5

It comes in ACL and goes out ACL.

The interchange procedure which is used by FEC and

6

ACL in Moncrief Yard# is also,quite simple.

7

locomotives and employees bring cars across the Sfc. Johns

8

River# north# across the Jacksonville Terminal Company and

9

drops them on a previously designated track in Moncrief Yard.

10

And on occasions they pick up cars at Moncrief Yard and take

11

them back to their own. classification yard south of the river.

12

The FEC# with its

The operating procedure which exists as to Moncrief

13

Yard# as well as the relationship between ACL and FEC# is#

14

we respectfully submit# totally distinguishable from the

15

situation which existed in the case decided by this Court in

16

March of last year.

17
18
19

20

2!
22
23
24
25

In the first place# the FEC owns no part of the ACL
stock or no part of ACL property.

Secondly# the FEC#

obviously owns no part of Moncrief Yard and has no interest
ownership-wise in Moncrief Yard.

The FEC exercises no dis­

cretion in either the overall management of ACL or in the
management and operation of Moncrief Yard.
The ACL does not maintain or repair any FEC cars and
very importantly# we submit in this case# no FEC employee
reports or leaves from work at the'picketed premises of
5

1

2

Moncrief Yard»
The 1967 picketing, which is an issue here , took

3

place at the ACL employee entrance into Moncrief Yard.

4

request which was made by picket signs, pamphlets and,

5

apparently, by telephone calls during the night, was for ACL

6

employee to go to work, but refusa to perform the functions

7

which they normally perform in that yard, namely; classify

8

and interchange cars which were the sole property of ACL.

9

There are at least three points which we believe

10

f

The

should be made so far as the picketing is concerned.
First, there is no relationship between the picketing

12

which took place at Moncrief Yard in the presence of FEC in

13

that yard.

!4

'■ Secondly, the intent, of the Brotherhood is obvious,

15

and was expressed by the highest official, insofar as this

16

strike is concerned, and that is: to close the ACL, because

17

the ACL was doing business with the FEC.

18

Thirdly, the picketing was designed to force ACL

19

employees to quite performing work which they normally did

20

for the ACL.

21

22
23
24
2$

Now, as to the relationship between the picketing
and the FEC presence in the yard.
There was no relafcionshipin time between the picketing
and FEC presence in the yard.

They picketed when the ACL

employees came to work and this was not necessarily at all the
6

1

time when FEC employees or engines might be in Moncrief Yard.

2

There was no relationship, in effect.

3

picketing was to cause ACL employees to cease to handle ACL

4

cars, and in many instances cars which were never originated

5

on and were not destined to FEC.

employees picketed.

"To enjoin, ACL from availing itself of the State

The ACL attempted to have the Federal action finally

20

The ACL stated in open court that it was willing to have its

21

22
23
24
25

complaint and its case dismissed with prejudice.

The Brother-

hood objected to a dismissal with prejudice, even though they
had not, in their handwritten answer sought any affirmative or
counter-relief and the challenged order was entered on June
IS, 1969, which (1) denied the ACL the right to dismiss its
8

1

complaint with prejudice and (2) enjoined the State Court

2

from enforcing the 1967 injunction, pending final hearing

3

in the case in which we respectfully submit, there was nothing

4

left to finally hear.

5

We did, however, seek a final hearing and we were

6

denied a final hearing and it is subsequent to that that

7

these Appellate proceedings were commenced.

8
9

In conclusion, as to the facts and the procedural
setting, which give rise to this case, we would respectfully

10

submit that the procedural vehicle of a Federal District

Judge enjoining a STafce Court used by the Brotherhood in this

12

case, is unique, and it does constitute a serious, and we

13

believe, a grave threat to continued Federal-State judicial

relationships.

18

The ACL sought injunctive relief in Federal Court in
1967 and that relief was denied because the Court was barred
from action by Norris-LaGuardia.
The Brotherhood did not, and has never sought any
i

19

counter or affirmative relief in that case.

We respectfully submit that the intent was obvious

and the effect was obvious and that was to subvert the

3

appellate processes of the State of Florida, avoid normal

appellate procedures in the State of Florida, and to seek

10

directly a review of a State Court Circuit Judge decision

by a Federal District Judge and it is that error, legally,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT BY DENNIS G. LYONS, ESQ.

17

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. LYONS:

18

Mr. Lyons.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

19

Court:

20

involving the attempts of the Railway Brotherhoods to involve

21

the neutral carriers in their seven-year labor disputes with

22

the FEC.

23

24
25

This case is quite different from the previous cases

The basic point of difference is that this is the
first case which involves an injunction granted out of the
courts in one of our concurrent jurisdictions, the Federal

i

jurisdiction, against proceedings infche State Court.
Now. we submit that for the Brotherhood here, to

2

3

prevail, for the REspondents here to prevail they must, on the

4

basic issue in this case, prevail on two pointss First they

5

must show that this case falls within the exceptions tothe

6

anti-injunction statute? that is Section 2283 of the Judicial

7

Code.
Secondly, after bringing the case within those

8
9

exceptions, they have to demonstrate that on the merits that

10

this Federal Court, Federal Law defense that they attempt to

11

litigate through this injunction against the State Court

12

proceedings»

,13

14
15
16

a

They further have to show that that defense is

good and valid defense.
Q

Doesn't it also have to show that the injunction

itself is not covered by Norris-LaGuardia?
A

Yes, and they further have to show that.

That

17

is sort of a severable point, but they also have to demon­

18

strate that,

19

The matter started by the injunction that our side

20

sought in the Federal Court, being denied for that very reason

21

We, on the other hand, may only prevail on one of the

22

points which we have just mentioned.

We need only to demon­

23

strate either that this case is not within any of the excep­

24

tions to Section 2283 or that the preemption or supercession

25

defense that they are attempting to litigate in this fashion,
11

1

isn't a good one, or that Norris-LaGuardia here takes away

2

the power of the Federal Court to enjoin»

3

Q

f you prevail you prevail on any one of those?

4

A

5

We start with Section 2283 of the Judicial Code,

Any one of those three, we submit, Your Honor»

6

which is a statute that takes back virtually to the start of

7

our constitutional republic.

8

passed in 1793»

9

remains inthe same substantial form in which it was enacted

10

n its earliest version it was

t has been amended at various times, but

back around in the Third Congress.
t now says "A court of the United States may not

\z

grant an injunction to stay proceeding in a state court,

13

except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress or where

14

necessary, in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or

15

effectuate its judgments."

16

This Court has construed that statute on a number of

17

occasions in the century and three-quarters that it's been on

18

the books.

19

The basic purpose of the statute, this Court has

20

said, is to avoid needless friction between the State and

21

Federal Court systems.

22

we have and have had since the foundation of our constitutional,

23
24
25

The first, reason, obviously

is that

republic two independent systems of courts operating.

The

relationship between them is a delicate matter.
The second reason is that of uniformity.

12

As this

1

Court has once said, "It is not only the State Court judges

2

that are capable of misinterpreting this Coutt*a decisions.w

3

The lower Federal Courts, this Court has indicated, sometimes

4

are, themselves.
"Recognizing that,"this Court has indicated, "if we

S
6

were to have the lower Federal Court sitting in judgment over

7

whether Federal Law defenses that were urged in the State

8

Courts were properly passed upon, we would -have less and less

9

uniformity? we would have different Federal judges taking

to

different views, just as you would have different state court

H

judges taking different views of what the Federal Law was.

12

We would be introducing added diversity and lack of uniformity

13

rather than simplifying matter.
So it is that the 1793 legislation is, in a way, in

14

same#

15

the

16

Judiciary Act of 1789, which again, has been on the books and

17

has been the basic principle of this 'Court's review of State

18

Courts judgments, and that is that this Court has jurisdiction

19

to review the validity of Federal Law defenses that are set

20

up in the State Courts, but then only where the case has pro-

21

ceededin an orderly fashion through the State Court system and

22

where the judgment of the highest State Court that is avail­

23

able to pass on the question has been obtained.

24
25

deals with the

subject matter as the first

Back in 1955 under the present version of the anti­
injunction statute, Section 2283 —
13

1
2
3

Q

May I ask a question:

This State Court injunc­

tion is not. under review is it now in the Florida State Court?
A

No.

The respondents were afforded an oppor­

4

tunity to submit a final judgment and T, believe at the time of

5

the hearing theyindicated that they would» so that they could

8

take an appeal from it through the State Court system.

7

Judge Lucky, the Florida, trial judge accorded them

8

that right in his letter of opinion, the letter of opinion

9

that5s complained of here, back on June 3 of 1969.

10

U
12

13
14

Q

Could they still enter a final judgment so that

•then there would be review in the —
A

Yes? they certainly could.

They have not done

that and the Respondents have not —
Q

I take it the injunction that, was issued, until

15

a final judgment is issued, that temporary injunction is not

16

itself appealable? is that right?

17

A

The Florida law, I believe, is a bit unclear, as

18

to that; as to whetherit would be or not, but the State Court

19

here was perfectly plain that he was perfectly willing to

20

give them an appealable order.

21

22
23
24

25

Q

Mr. Lyons, I was a little puzzled by your

emphasis in the briefs and now on the union’s failure to get.
a decree or a judgment entered.

Ordinarily the prevailing

party takes that, responsibility, don't they?
A

Well, we were asked to come into agreement with

14

1

counsel for the Respondent as to the form of the judgment to

2

be entered;, and counsel for the respondent» I am sure will

3

confirm this» has indicated that he does not wish to join with

4

us in settling the terms of a final judgment —

5

Q

Is there anything to prevent you in the mean­

6

time from sending him a copy of a proposed judgment and saying

7

that if there is no comment within ten days you are going to

8

ask the court to enter that judgment?

9

A

WEll» I believe we have sent them a draft.

We

10

have never taken the other step» but he has never given us any

11

comments on the form of the judgment.

12
13
14

Q

I5m not sure what difference it makes» except

that you seem to dwell on it 30 much.
A

Well» the fact of thematter is» Your Honor» the

15

only point we're trying to make is that it's entirely within

16

the Respondent's power if he wants to appeal Judge Lucky's

17

injunction.

18

LUcky is» of course —

19

20
21

Q

It's entirely within his power to do so and Judge

I take it, then that a final judgment may be

entered without further hearing? is that it?
A

I believe it could be.

In fact» 1 believe the

22

Respondent so requested.

23

hearing on the preliminary injunction in the — as many facts

24

were involved then» I believe» as could be.

25

There was an extensive evidentiary

In 1955» using as it was than in effect» the present
15

1

version in Section 2283 in the Richmond Brothers case# this

2

Court made it plain that litigation of a so-called labor

3

preemption or labor supercession Federal Law of defense to

4

a State Court proceeding was not an exception to Section 2283#

5

simply because your position was that the State Court was

6

moving in an area where there was preemption or supercession

7

because of Federal labor policy# that did not give you a right

8

to go into Federal Court and obtain an injunction against the

9

State Court proceedings»

10

The Court -there said that there was no additional

11

implicit exceptions to be read into Section 2283 even where

12

the contention by the parties seeking the injunction was that

3

the State Court was wholly without jurisdiction over the sub­

4

ject matter, having invaded a field preempted by Congress»

5
6
7
8
9
20
21

22
23
24
25

And let me say that this case, I believe, is not even
as. strong a case for a Federal Court injunction as with
Richmond Brothers,

In Richmond Brothers we had a situation

under the Taft-Hartley Act, the Labor Management Relations Act,
where this Court, has held that the State Courts are without
jurisdiction.
Now, the principal substantive authority for that
preemption or supercession defense that the Respondents are
urging here is this Court9s decision in the Jacksonville
Terminal case at the last term, where this Court expressly
said that the State Courts had jurisdiction but that in. the
16

1

circumstances there presented, that the application of their

2

own State substantive law had there to yield, because of pre­

3

eminent Federal policies.

4

Howe since there is no implicit exception for adjudi­

5

cation of the preemption or supercession defense, we turn to

6

the text of the statute»

7

statute that the Respondents are citings
The first exception is for injunctions necessary in

8
9

There are two exceptions in the

aid of District Court's jurisdiction»

The reviser's note in

10

the existing precedents from the 348 era, and this exception,

11

at least, was designed to carry forward the preexisting law,

12

indicates that that exception deals with two cases»

13

First you have the removed case where a case is re­

14

moved from the State Court to the Federal Court and then the

15

State Court tries to go ahead with the case as if nothing had

16

happened»

17

protect its jurisdiction and aid of the District Court's

18

jurisdiction, it may enjoin the proceedings in the State Court,

19

The other had to do with a fund or to break into Latin,
05 RES” o
what the Courts call a / If there is a particular fund, then

20

And there the authorities indicate by an order to

21

that only one court can take jurisidction over, the exception

22

is also applicable.

23

The decisions of this Court in Kline versus Burke

24

Construction and Princess Nita v. Thompson, back before the

25

to prevent relitigation by the State Courts over a dispute

decision of this Court.

16

It’s a construction of the anti-

injunction statute which was the Toucey, the New York Life

17

case back in '41.

18

The Respondents have tried, then, to characterise

19

this case as one where the Federal Court was acting in enjoin­

20

ing these proceedings simply to protect or effectuate its

21

judgments.

22

Now, for the first time in this Court they pointed to

23

a whole litany of proceedings in the Federal Court, the cases

involving the Government’s suit against the FEC, to which the

We come back to the order which is the one that they

have relied on fchrougixrat, and 'that is the April 26, 1967

I think the explanation for this delay is simple.

What happened in 1969 was this Court’s decision in the

Jacksonville Terminal litigation.

trying to litigate in the Federal Court doesn't have anything

4

to do? really,? with the meaning of the District Court's 1967

order.

What the Respondents are

What they are trying to litigate is a preemption

Is it really preemption or even supercession?

not sure it's either.

Right or wrong; yes.

Well, isn't, that what it comes down to, that the

claim is that under Jacksonville, this Court's opinion in

Jacksonville, since this case was virtually indistinguishable,

the State Court was wrong in issuing an injunction,

That was their claim? yes,

And therefore , the Federal District Court lias

no, you san8t do that, because of the statute.”

Q

If

Yes, that really -It'

really a matter of right or wrong? isn't

I think that's —

And then, -the only Federal Court that can pass on

That's correct, Your Honor.

In the first place, the real basis to us in the

23

Federal Court denial of an injunction back in '67 to the ACL,

24

appears to be the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

25

Virtually all the

cases which the order cites are Norris-LaGuardia Act cases,

and the legislative history of the Morris-LaGuardia Act makes

it quite plain that that act was aimed solely at the Federal
