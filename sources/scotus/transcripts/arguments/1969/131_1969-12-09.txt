Basically, the thought behind the regulation, I

affidavit which appears on page 194 of the record extract.
That affidavit states: "It is my recollection that a maximum
since
grant regulation has been effect in Maryland/approximately the
time of inception of statewide needs standards in 1944.

It is

also my recollection that these maximum grant regulations con­
sistently have received Federal approval.

I also recall that

one factor giving rise to these regulations, is a strong feeling
on the part of many county boards, particularly during the
3

period following adoption of statewide needs standard in 1944

regulations , the State Department of Public Welfare secured

information as to wage levels from the State Employment Service

gainfully employed off welfare; is that — do I understand that
correctly?
MR. LIEBMANN:
in one sense.

I think, Your Honor, that's correct

I think Your Honor, that there is a problem —

there was a problem with insufficient funds — I’d rather out it
this way, that there was a problem of insufficient funds and
the board was confronted with the problem of making a choice

25
4

i

between different means of carrying out a reduction and for the

a

policy reason that it thought that grants shouldn’t exceed the

3

income of employed families, it chose the device of the maxi­

4

mum grant, rather than the device of a percentage reduction

5

across the board for all AFDC recipients, which is the device

6

that's been employed in some other states»
ME. JUSTICE STEWART:

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

How does that second aspect, of

these reasons.fit a family where there is no breadwinner?
MR. LlEBMAfJN:

Your Honor, we discussed this at some

length in our brief and we suggest that in addition to the
— we suggest that there are several considerations which can
support the regulations.

One of them is the element of work

incentive? another is the undesirability of establishing bene­
fit levels at levels higher than prevailing -wage rates in the
community, because of the effect that this may have on families
that are hot on welfare, because of the possible incentive to

There is another answer, I think, to your question

and that is that, in speaking of families that don'thavea

In Maryland, I believe the fraction is

And this is done even though there are elaborate

procedures for insuring that people are not malingering on the

i

Workmen's Compensation rolls and not malingering on the unemploy­
ment rolls.

And the reason is, I think, essentially a concession

to administrative imperfection; the feelina that if you don't
set benefit,levels.at £east somewhat below the wage level, there
6

is going to be abuse, and I think that that feeling also enters

2

into the maximum grant regulation in its application to

families which, when you look at —■ when you look at them, may

The second element that I think is worth suggesting,
is that the Maryland regulations, unlike thosein some states,

22

such as Maine and Arizona* is a limitation only on the amount

23

of the grant, not on the amount of a welfare family’s budget,

24

and that is to say; if a family has state-computed needs of

Now„ the complaint in this action made three
claims.

0
10

The first was a claim of violation of stata laws.

Thafe

claim is ecntainedin Paragraph Roman Number XVIXX of that
complaint.
The second was a claim of violation of the preamble

12

of the Social Security Act of 1935„ which was said to afford a

13

basis for a finding that this regulation was inconsistent with
the Social Security Act.

There was no mention made in the

IS

complaint of any more specific violations of the Social Security

IS

Act.

17

The lower court, in its initial opinion, found a
violation of Section 802 fa)9 of the Social Security Act and it
conceded, on reargument that -- and X think X am quoting from

20

the transcript on re argument --"'the statutory argument is the

21

basis of the decision that was, relevantly speaking, devised

22

by the Court, rather than the one that was impressed on the

23

court by your and your colleagues, addressina Plaintiff!s

m

counsel." That, X think, is true and on reargument the conclus­

25

ion that the statute violated thatprovision of the Social

8

Security Act was withdrawn»

X would like to deal with each of these

With respect to the claim of the violation of

5
6

state law, the state filed a motion to dismiss on grounds of

7

equitable extension»

8

its oral opinion on this point is foundon Page 83 of the record

9

extract, and it cited the case of King versus Smith for the

The court below declines to abstain and

10

proposition that it was proper for a Federal Court to go for-

n

ward with an adjudication on the merits, irrespective of

12

whether a state court, by state construction and state law at

13

some later date might achieve the same result»

14

doesn't appear anywhere in King versus Smith, because X think

IS

it's fair that King versus Smith was concerned with the fact

16

that there is no Federal requirement of exhaustion of state-

17

administered remedies»

That language

King versus Smith was concerned with the exhaustion

IS
19

problem»

SO

judicial remedias was not an issue in King versus Smith, It is

21

the state's position here that the claim that the regulation

22

was violative of state law, should have been regarded as pro­

23

viding a basis for equitable abstention in favor of a declarator;

24

judgment action in the state courts and it is, I think, clear

25

The question of equitable abstention in favor of state

from the cases under the Maryland Declaratory Judgment Act,
9

1

where the general validity of a state statute or regulation, is

2

assailed as it is heres that an action in the state courts for

3

a declaratory judgment would lie»
The state courts, of course, could have determined

4
5

all three questions raised by the complaint»

The Federal Court

S

was effectively limited to the two Federal questions., and the

7

reason that you havethis delusion between the Federal Courts

8

..and the state regulations was the failure to abstain in this

case.

With respect to the Federal statutory claim, there

The first point is the obvious one and the one
16

I

which the lower co—

took note of in its opinion on reargument

expressly recognised by Concrress in legislation,

20
21

And that the

,
Maryland regulation, specifically has been, on at least 20
occasions, accepted for incorporation into the state plan by

22
the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

precise issue legally, between you and the other parties?
MR. LIEBMANN:

I think the issue, Your Honor, is

there are several issues.

I think the basic issue is' ■

whether the lower court acted properly

17

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

18

MR. LIEBMANN:

The crucial issue.

The crucial issue is whether the

1©

lower court acted properly in invalidatincr this state maximum

20

grant regulation on its face, under the equal protection clause,

21

when this regulation was repeatedly valid, at least to some of

22

the people to whom it would be applied and when it was supported

23

by several rational pacings.

questions.

There was no question of forfeiture

to pass at all in this case, whatever the decision, on effort
to command ths state to make appropriations to make these pay­
ments?
MR. LIEBMANN: Your Honor, my answer to that question
would be this:

in many of the states where we have these

...

regulations, the fiscal effects of their invalidation are so
‘
*
great that even where the relief granted by the District .Court
is negative, even where it takes the form of a negative

17

In substance, it constitutes affirmative relief

against a state government of the type described by the 11th

making appropriations? having an act passed by the legislature

MR. LIEBMANN:

I think, Your Honor, the natura of

the choice presented to the state governments by these decision?;
particularly, when you look, for example, to the decision in

10

California, where your fiscal effects were on the order of $40

II

or $50 million.

fa

The nature of the choice presented to the

state governments involves such a fundamental alteration in a

13

state expenditure program that this Court should take the view

14

that the grant of an injunction, even negative reform under

IS

those circumstances, is, in fact, such an interference with the

17

sovereign powers of the state as to be prescribed by the 11th

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOSEPH A. MATERA, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. MATERA: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and Associate
Justices of this Court;

As I listened to the various arguments

this morning 1 couldnst help but notice how too often labels
get put on things, including poverty lawyers, and I think it's
important to point out that in this particular case as well, the

8
state so often has resorted to labels and somehow covered over
9

10

the real issues in this case.
I think that it1s important to point out from the

f?

j

'
very beginning that the essential matters that we dealing with

12
here, are not such things as less eligibility principles,

13
economic regulationsj we're dealing here with the program of
U
assistance to needy and dependent children, which is very much

15
given its guidelines, in fact, completely by the Social Securifc'j

16
Act, as implemented in each state.

17
I think it3s important to point out here that this

18

s

maximum grant regulation, in effect, creates a class of non­

19
persons, of children who, if they are unfortunate enough to be

20
born the fourth child, the fifth child in a two-parent family

21
or the sixth child in a one-pa:

nt family, are simply ignored

22
by the state in computing their needs, that as a matter of fact,!

23
the state computes their needs and then simply ignores them.

24
We have here, and I think it is important to

25
20

point

i

out, two classes of individual created by this regulation„

%

The one class are children in families of six individuals or

3

less» -The state computes what their minimum subsistence needs j

4

are, in accordance with their own standards and then pays their

$

full computed subsistence needs,,

MR» JUSTICE STEWART:

May I ask — That computation

is rather complicated, is it not, depending upon the sex and

8

the age of the child, and upon whether or not he. is the third,

MR. MATERA:

These are computations by the state

creates by its own standards, and there is a diminishing rate

as the family grows larger.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Could you point in the appendi&

understanding of that may have no little relevance to the issues

here.

MR. MATERA:

But, in effect, these computations are

due to provide for the needs of each child in the family until
the child becomes,, either the fifth child in a two-parent
family or the sixth child in a one-parent family, and then the
computations no longer provide for that child.

Their needs

are computed but the state does not any longer provide for their
needs.

Well, I don’t want to unduly interrupt your

MR. JUSTICE STEWART;

Could you tell me, just so I

can follow your argument: It is a little bit more complicated
than just $28.50 per month par child, or something like that;
isn't that correct?

Security Act, provides that each needy individual should be

given subsistence needs and that these subsistence needs are

provided for needy dependent children in small families, but

that once the family gets beyond that the state completely

ignores those needs»

MR. MATERA:

And that in denying this assistance to

13

families of five or six children or more, .that in denying

14

assistance to these children they are simoly treating these

children as nonpersons, which is a concept which this Court de­

16

nounced in both Levy v. Louisiana and in Shapiro v. Thompson.

I think perhaps if I turn first to the statutory
argument, that the matter will --MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

25

MR. MATERA:

That, Your Honor — yes, and they do.

MR. JUSTICE MUTE:
MR. MATERA:

Why?

Well, they do because it3s clearly

seen that for a second, third or fourth child that because they

all live in the same family, it would be far less to take care

2

of that third or fourth child, because that child shares the

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

cannot fix a maximum figure?
MR. MATERA:

The state cannot set a maximum figure

which is based simply on arbitrary family size which denies
assistance toone classification of needy dependent children
while at the same time providing assistance for the second
class in this particular case, children of small families.
I think if we look at the Social Security Act it­

17

18

The same argument would be made by

us? yes.

12

13

If there was a maximum based on family

size which neglected the later children in the family? yes, the

10

II

Well, suppose they fixed

self, and Mr. Justice Douglas certainly did, I think,.set out
'

the real issues in this case.

We have contended from the begin­

ning and we have contended here that the two basic issues in
this case are:

(1) that the maximum grant regulation does

violate the Social Security Act, and

(2)

that it does violate

■

23

the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
'

Now, in what way does it violate the Social Security

24
Act?

The very underlying purpose of the Act itself, is to

25
25

1

strengthen family life and to keep families together„

2

itself,'saw the wisdom of seeing to'it that children are allowe

a

allowed to be broughtup in their own homes„

4

Congress

Slow, when we turn to the stipulations of this case,

S

which are contained on Page 71 and 1 would ask this Court to

6

give special consideration to these stipuations, we find this

7

to be true: that the Gary family, Mr. and Mrs. Gary*, according

8

to the computations of the welfare department itself, would be

0

entitled to $331 a month and the Williams, according to the

10

computations of the welfare department would be entitled to

1!

$296 a month, but because of the maximum grant regulations

12

they are, of course, restricted to $250.

13

However, there is a way that the Gary family and.

14

the children of that family who are ignored and treated as

IS

nonpersons, could receive benefits? and there is a way' that the

16

children in the Williams family could receive benefits. They

17

could receive benefits simply by leaving the home, because the

m

same regulations that this welfare department provides is that

m

if the Gary family would place two children -

20

between the ages of six and 12, rather —■ the "children are

zt

younger, either with eligible relatives, or in institutions,

2Z

each one of these children would be entitled to $65 a month and

23

at the same time the Gary family would continue to receive the

24

maximum grant of $250.

25

12 years old —-

%
MR. JUSTICE STEWART:
26

Now, does that $65 a month

1

come under this same APDC?

z

MR. MATERA:

3

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

4

MRo MATERA:

Yes.
It would? not separate?

At the same time, it the Williams

S

family, Your Honor, could put -- if Mrs. Williams would put

8

two or her children in there, somewhat older, over the age of

7

12, with eligible relatives or in institutions, they would be

8

entitled to $79 a month each, And at the same time Mrs. Williams

0

would continue to receive her grant of $250.

This completely

10

undermines the very purposeof the Social Security Act, which is

It

'to keep families together and to allow children to be brought

'12

up. in their own homes.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

May I ask you just one

question?

4

MR» MATERA: Yes, sir»

S

MR» JUSTICE BLACK:

Let’s suppose here is a family

6

with one and a family with three and a family with eight»

7

it your argument that under the law that is a family of eight

8

and each child must get exactly as much as a child would that i-i

9

in a family of only one or three?
MR. MATERA:

10

No, Your Honor.

Is

As a matter of fact,

11

as I pointed out earlier, there is a sort of diminishing amount

12

that's computed by the state as the family gets larger. That, it

13

is recognised that —
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

14
IS

I thought that was your equal

protection claim.

16

MR. MATERA:

Well, the equal protection claim is

17

where the state cuts off completely.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

18

Cuts off completely; I under­

W

stood it was because of the difference paid the third child,

20

whether one or three or eight.

21
22

23
24
25

Isn't that right; isn’t that

your claim?
MR. MATERA:

It isn't the difference paid to the

child, it's the complete ignoring of the needs of the children
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

Well, Mr. Mafcera, I thought

you answered this question Justice Black has just asked you,
29

1

when I asked you before»

The idea is that if there is only one

2

chi id, - the computation of what the bare minimum subsistence

a

requirement for that child is, maybe $30, let’s say,

4

MR. MATERA:

B

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: For two children, the bare

Yes.

6

subsistence requirement for the first miaht be $30, but because

7

there are two children, the bare subsistence requirement for the

9

second child may be only $25? is that it?
MR. MATERA:

B

That’s correct,

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

to

And you go on dovm, $30, $25,

11

$20 for the thijfd child and $15 for the fourth child; is this

12

right?

13

MR. MATERA:

That is correct. .

14

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

Well, once you get up to the

15

total of $250, if there are fifth, sixth, seventh children, ever

16

though they compute what the bare subsistence requirement for

17

the fifth, sixth and seventh children may be, they make no
.

18

provision for payment to the family for those three children.

19

Is that it? .

.

SO

MR.MATERA:

Yes? that’s correct.

21

MR. JUfilCE BRENNAN:

And your argument is that in

22

cutting out, which is the effect of the $250 maximum, the fifth,

23

sixth and seventh children,there is a denial of equal protection

rX-

as between them and the first, second and third and fourth child­
ren?
30

1

MR. MATERA:

2

Yes, Your Honor. I'd like to get into

that equal protection argument —

a.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

Could I just ask you for a

4

minute on that: if there is $30 given forth© first child and

§

$10 for the second child, isn't really the determination that

0

the minimum subsistence is $20 for each child?

7

MR. MPTSRA:

No, that's not true, Justice White,

8

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

And so the second child only

needs $10?

0

MR. MATERA:

10

n

That's not true.

It's based on a

standard of need —
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

2£

Isn't the payment just to the

family?

13

MR. MATERA:

14

The payment is to the family but it is

based on the needs of the number of individuals in that family.

15

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

10

Yes3 but $30 isn't allocated to

A and $10 to B or anything like that?

17

MR. MATERA:

28

No, sir? it is dependent upon the

number of individuals.

19

MR. JUSTICE MUTE: So, when the state sets a

20
21

maximum of $250, the money is allocable among all members of

22

the family.

23

the the seventh child is going to not share at all in the $250?

It doesn't mean that the state doesn't think that

MR. MATERA:

24

I would disagree in this respect,

Mr. Justice White, because the state does think that, because

when they looked at the Gary family and the number of people in

that family, they said, "You need, in order to live, $33.1,

MR, JUSTICE WHITE:

I understand that.

That isn't

the question I asked.

6

The question I asked was —

7

MR. MATERAs

Of course, the welfare department, I

a

assume, would believe that the mother would fake those funds

a

which already are minimal and certainly divide them among the

10

children, because she wouldn't allow certain children to starve,

fi

merely because their needs are not recognised, you see,

12

.

,

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN;

Which would mean that no one

13

in the'-family gats what the state has determined to be the

14

basic minimum essential for each person in the family.

13

MR. MATERA:- That is correct.

16

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN; Isn't that correct?

1?

No one

can do that.
MR. MATERA;

18

That is correct, if the mother cer~
.

19

tainly had to dilute the entire grant, every child in the family

20

would suffer.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

21

Suppose, hypothetically

this case, who came in: Mr. Smith.

trouble with the equal protection

argument.
MR. MATERA:

Well, Your Honor, the needs are basic

17
subsistence needs as established by the state and they are basic

18
19

20

subsistence needs for families of each computed size.

And I

think whan the state talks about their rational purposes to save
their regulation from falling unde» the equal protection case, I

21
think they used the approach that the state did us

in the

22

I
Shapiro v. Thompson case, the same blunderbuss approach.

They

.23
talked, for example, that the regulation somehow,

ncourages

24
employment, but when we look at the facts in this case, if you

2S
34

1

somehow look at the less eligibility principle that was enun­

s

ciated in England, I think, in 1825, we know that we have moved

a

a long way from them.

4

recognize that we have a much more sophisticated and enlightened

S

welfare program now which looks toward rehabilitation and re­

6

education and retraining and as a matter of fact, this 1967

7

Amendments to the Social Security Act clearly provide for this ;

3

kind of an approach to employment.

in this particular light the — in light of the employment pur­

traditional test of equal protection, and we have first argued

in our brief the traditional test of equal protection.

16

people who, as our main plaintiffs, are not able to work. Both

ofour main plaintiffs in this case are disabled.

18

that it's applied only against large families, as if to assume

19

that the heads of all large families are employable, but the

29

small families and heads of small families, somehow do not need

21

this type of encouragement to work.

So, it Is grossly overinclusive.

This

It is underinr-

23

clusive in the sense that it does not include the small family.

So, it suffers from this uniqueness of being not only over-

The exhibits of the state and the state has referred

a

tosome of their exhibits, point out that only 1S6 families on

3

the whole welfare program were assisted with employment.

4

we have at least 2500 families who are affected by the maximum

put into this appendix by the state, also indicate that even

7

if all of the jobs in Maryland, were somehow to be employed for

a

welfare recipients, there still wouldn’t be enough jobs.

So that this partiqylar purpose really has no

In addition tofchat, exhibits that have been

viability in light of the amendments to the Social Security Act.
In addition to that, the state talks about this

12

regulation somehow acting as a family stabiliser.

13

purpose is ironic, in view of the stipulations which show how

14

a family is encouraged to disintegrate, instead of stay to­

15

gether. Again, it is overinc. usive.

16

I think this

An exhibit which the state itself put into evidence

17

in the court below, is contained on Page 154 of the appendix,

1©

points out that only 15 percent of families on welfare are on

m

welfare because the head of the family deserted them.

20

For the purpose of encouraging heads of large

2!

families only not to desert, we are going to punish 85 percent

22

of the welfare caseload.

23

This is grossly overinclusive.

In addition, again it has that uniqueness of being

24

under inclusive, for it is only applied against the heads of

25

1arge £amilies.

Thirdly, the state would talk about it being a

So that we are talking about a purpose which would
begin to invade a fundamental right, the right of procreation
and the right to marital privacy, and this gets me into the

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Well, how did that que -tion

get into this issue.
MR. MATERA:

Well, Your Honor, in the case of Mr.

and Mrs. Gary, for example, all of their children were born
prior to the time they went on welfare.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

19

MR. MATERA:

Were before what?

All of them were born prior to the timi;

20

Mr. and Mrs. Gary were required to seek welfare assistance.

MR» MATERA:

Your Honor, we would still maintain

that it is ah invasion here of marital privacy and the right tc
procreation,,

We would still have to maintain that,

4

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: So, the time when they

S

were born, in relationship to relief, has nothing to do with

the case?

MR. MATERA:

It has something to do with the case i r

this sense, that we are punishing the parents of children for

an act which they had a perfect legitimate/to exercise, even

10

prior to the time that they were required to seek welfare

12

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Well, do I take that as .

13

a suggestion that their ri^jht is different after they go on

relief?

15

MR. MATERA:

Their right is no different, Your

Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

MR. MATERA:

Well, then —

It is only relevant in this case to

point out how it affects families who, perhaps have already had

their children prior to the time they go on welfare.

needed we16re assistance.

and who is punishing them and what is it they are being punish?: d

38

MR. MATERA;

it costs exactly the same to maintain a family of eight thatit

MR. MATERA;

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

That is not part of your

argument?
MR. MATERA; No, it wouldn’t be part of my argument,

15
16

No, Your Honor that wouldn’t be —

at all.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

You wouldn't claim that MaryIan:

couldn’t make a difference between the amount per child it woult

19

give to a family of eight and a family of two?

2©

MR. MATERA:

Not at all.

jj
Your Honor, we have maintained that this regulation

22

is unconstitutional, under the traditional test; but we would

23

maintain that this Court should apply the special scrutiny or

24

compelling state interest test because of the fact that there

25

are fundamental rights involved here.

I. have already talked

classification; a classification that was struck down by this

Court in Levy v. Louisiana»

enough, under this regulation, to be born the fifth child of a

6

two-parent family or the sixth child of a one-parent family, he

7

is at that time put in a suspect classification and that. —

3

and welfare assistance is, at that point, denied to him.

As soon as a child is unfortunate

This Court has struck down such classifications in

3
10

Levy v. Louisiana as well as in Shapiro v.'Thompson.

11

would maintain that because the regulation creates a suspect

12

classification the traditional test should not be applied here,

13

but. that the compelling interest for a special scrutiny test

14

should be applied.

The welfare check, Your Honor, goes to

the head of the family.
MR. JUSTICE' STEWART:

If if is a single woman,

either because he spouse has abandoned her, or died, if goes to
her; and. if it's a man or woman and they are both incapacitated,
it goes what, to the man?
