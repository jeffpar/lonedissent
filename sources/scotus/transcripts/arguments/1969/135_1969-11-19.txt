Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

of Appeals of the State of New York., affirming an order for
summary judgment obtained by the defendant dismissing the com"
plaint, which asserts that the plaintiff, the appellant here,
is a citizen and a real estate taxpayer who sought an adjudica­
tion that the constitutional and statutory provisions of the
State of New York which exempt from real estate taxation all
the property of religious corporations used solely for religious
purposes violates the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amend­
ment of the United States Constitution.
He asserts in his complaint that he is a Christian,

?8
19

not a member of any particular sect, and objects that the amount

20

by which his taxes are increased by the exemption of all reli­

21

giously owned property used for religious purposes from taxation

22

constitutes an involuntary contribution by him to the activities

23

of these religious organisations, which violates his freedom of

24

religion.

I just wondered,

Now going to the merits of the argument, I do not

II

intend to quote to this Court much of what it has said in the

12

over 500 pages that the Court has written between Gohitis and

13

Fiasfc on the question of the meaning of the First Amendment.

14

I think it appropriate, however, that we approach our argument

15

with the statement made by Mr. Justice Jackson speaking for the

16

Court in the Barnett case, which established that the flag salut(

17

violated the First Amendment.

18

Mr. Justice JackSon'&r the Court stated,

"The task of

19

translating majestic generalities of the Mil of Rights, eonceiv< id

20

as a part of the pattern of liberal government in the 18th Cen­

21

tury, places concrete restraints on officials dealing with prob­

22

lems of the 20th Century, is one to disturb self-confidence.”

23

These changed conditions from the laissez-faire situa­

24

tion in the 18th Century to the Government control of our centur”

25

when liberty is infringed.

7

But we act to meet matters

We cannot because of modest estimates of our competence

Approaching this question, it is the appellant's sub­

8

mission that the plain words, the first ten words of the First

9

Amendment of the Bill of Rights that Congress, which now include..;

10

11
12
13

the state, shall pass no law respecting the establishment of
religion, bars all aid to religion including the massive tax
exemption from real estate taxes presented in this case.
I will not pause to lead the Court again, as it has

14

gone through its opinions through the course in the First Con­

15

gress, which produced these general words respecting the estab­

16

lishment of religion.

17

narrower words introduced into the House, no law establishing

18

religion, and out of the still narrower words introduced into

19

the Senate, no lav/ establishing articles of faith.

20

It suffices to say that out of these

In the conference between the two Houses in which Mr.

21

Madison was a member of the conference, we extracted the worlds

22

"No law respecting the' establishment of religion" which the

23

Congress adopted and the states adopted.

24
23

Now this Court has said in Everson and in every case
considered since Everson that the generalities of these words

s

notonly prohibit the

2

any aid to religion.

establishment of a church, but they prohib: .t

Neither the state or the Federal Government can set up a

9

The appellant's position very simply is that just as

10

this Court has repeatedly stated, and indeed in the last case,

11

in the Plasfc case, that of course the First Amendment forbids

12

aid to religion under any tax funds, that any taxes be exacted

13

or spent on religion.

14

this exemption from real estate taxes is precisely the same as

15

if the State of New York had passed a law stating that all reli­

16

gious property shall be valued, so at least we might know its

17

evaluation — increasing evaluation, and shall be taxed like all

18

other properties, but that upon application by the taxpayer dis­

19

closing that it is a religious organisation and the property is

2©

used solely for religious purposes, these taxes should be Kefunde d

It is the appellant's submission that

We submit to the Court that the exemption before us is

21

22

no different, and if this Court would, strike down the hypothetics 1

23

statute I suggested, it should strike down the exemption statutes

24

of the State of New York.

But it is so far as the statutes are

concerned included with the other classifications.
Q

Does your argument go so far as to reach hospital,

run by religious organisation?
A

No, of course not.

The hospitals, the asylums,

14

the orphanages, the educational institutions, schools, all of

these institutions which are run by religious organisations,

gious purposes.

Does that not assume that religious-oriented

schools are not : interchanged with religions?
A

No, no, it does not at all, Your Honor, but it

is

an aid to religion»

Thisoroposi-

rather difficult to expand upon

Its very statement is its own proof.
Unless this Court is preoared to say that factually
8

1

an exemption is of purely religious purposes, is not an aid to

2

religion — unless the Court is prepared to say that, it must

3

say that it is an aid to religion which is unconstitutional.

4

1 think I would like to say a few words about the

3

defense, if I may call it that, of the argument which the cor-

6

poration counsel has presented in his brief on the subject.

7

these are the defenses presented usually to support awkward

8

facts that we h&ve in all of the states of this exemption.

9
10

11

12

And

And

although we have had it all of the states for 130 years, it now
for the first time comes squarely before this Court for con­
sideration.
The first argument in support of it the argument, how

13

is it that this exemption stands on the books of all the states

14

for so long without having been challenged in this Court?

15

answer, I think, is a tribute to the great political power of

16

religious organizations in this country that have been able to

1?

achieve this exemption from taxation for so long.

18

The

Another reason is that when this started, at the begin -

19

ning of our Republic, the tax question was a very minor one.

20

The tax question has only loomed large when with all of these

21

tax exemptions the religious organizations accumulated literally

22

hundreds of millions dollars of property.

23

increasing social services that are required, the matter becomes

24
25

And now with the

acute as to ■whether this isn'Jt part of the real estate in the
United States which constitutionally should be subject to taxes.
9

I

And indeed another simple argument is that history

2

cannot turn "aid'' into "no aid" not only in real estate tax

3

exemption, but it has been common in our public schools saying

4

public prayers and Bible reading.

3

the beginning of the Republic»

6

Court in the last 20 years when citizens determined to raise the

7

issue.

8

This has been going on since

And it has only reached this

Take the Sunday School [sic] laws»

The Sunday School

9

laws at this Court in its decisions recognizes these, of course,

10

had a religious origin, and yet they went on with this religious

11

justification, legislative justification with religion»

12

went on from the beginning of the Republic until a few years

13

ago and the Court in its opinion stated, "Wa would strike these

14

Sunday laws down as unconstitutional establishment of religion,

15

if it were not for the fact that in the development of our coun­

16

try a secular reason for these laws had supplanted the original

17

religious purpose of the lav/s»"

18

And the Court said, "If the purpose was aid to reli­

13

gion, the Sunday laws would have been stricken down»"

20

stayed because the purpose had become secular..

21

They

And it

But it is only as our country developed and people

22

wanted to open uo stores on Sunday, the stores that were involved

23

that the question was presented to this Court, despite the fact

24

that it Was in its origins unconstitutional, although not tested,

23

I think that this takes care of the arguments in
10

1

history to the extent that it can be taken care of*

I do not

2

mean to blink at the point that a practice which existed for so

3

long carries with it a certain historical momentum of its own.

4

But this Court is eo stranger to striking down laws as unconsfci-

i

S

tutional, which the American people have Accepted for a long

6

period of time until the time comes when a citizen properly

7

raises the question,, as I believe Mr. Walz has done, and require;;

8

that these laws be stricken down.
Now the second point that Mr. Rankin makes also had it,'5

9
10

interest, is that the exemption really supports the purpose of

n

the amendment, which was to prevent strife between religion and

12

the secular state, that leaving the state alone in this respect

13

promotes that neutrality, which was one purpose of the First

14

Amendment.

15

If the Court please, my answer to that is that taxing

16

real estate used for religious purposes like other real estate,

1?

is just as neutral as not taxing it.

18

this to promote any conflict with the Church and I cannot see

19

how it will produce a conflict with the Church, to treat such

20

property as all other real estate is treated.

There is not intended by

Now, the third argument that Mr. Rankin refers to in

21

22

his brief is also a common one, that what the legislatures have

23

done is to consider religion like other charities which it

24

exempts.

2S

more recent period of our history took up the burden of charity

That it is true, of course, that .religion until a

11

1

the aims houses, the hospitals;, the orphanages* the old people's

2

homes* all of this in earlier days was largely left to religious

3

private activities.,

4

it explains* I think* why the legislatures have placed religious

5

activity into the same statutory framework as other charitable

S

activities.

7

This* of course* is no longer the case and

But it cannot satisfy the constitutional requirements

8

that both the Congress and all of the legislatures are expressly

9

prohibited from treating religion like other charitable activity is»

10

11

The states and Congress are prohibited from this.
Now another answer is that the prayer in the public

12

schools and the Bible reading in the public schools which this

13

Court has stricken down as unconstitutional* that promotes

?4

moral values just as religious activity promotes moral values,

!5

But just as that is not a sufficient basis, to say a prayer,

is

the fact that it promotes a secular object, if you will, namely,

17

moral consideration -- it is not enough to say a prayer, then

m

it is not enough to save the tax exemption.

19

Now the last argument which is made on this point by

20

Mr. Rankin is that this Court has approved other exemptions.

21

For example, the Selective Service exemptions where the Court

22

excuses ministers

23

and conscientious objectors.

24

that the Court struck down, but those laws which a state has

25

chosen to give an exemption to people who observe the Sabbath

or rather, the statutes excuse ministers
And the Sunday laws, not the ones

12

1

and let them run their business on Sunday.

2.

The distinction, we submit, is that the power of the

3

Congress in the interest of national defense ahd general wel­

4

fare, it didn't have to give those exemptions.

5

out of respect for acts of conscience, for religious conscience.

6

But it has not been suggested by the Christian churches that the

7

payment of real estate taxes would offend their freedom of reli­

8

gion in the sense of their freedom of conscience.

9

church which recognises that Caesar shall have what is his and

10

God shall have what is his would not make the argument that to

11

It did give them

Surely a

pay real estate taxes violates their conscientious scruples.

12

They merely ask to be exempt from the payment of taxes, and I

13

think that this is a great distinction between these cases.

14

Now I am going to address myself just very briefly to

15

an argument that is not made by the City of New York, and that

16

is this statute is required by the free exercise of laws.

17

argument is made in the brief of the National Council of Churchei

18

of Christ in the United States of America by Mr. Tuttle, who is j

19

here today, to hear the argument.

i

20

That

Now Mr. Tuttle relies for that contention that these

21

lav/s are not only permissible, but are required, on the Murdock

22

case and the Follett case.

23

dock, the Court stated that you could not place a.license tag

24

on the very activity of distributing religious literature by

25

members of a religious sect, for whom the essence of their

And as Your Honors will recall, Mur­

13

and selling their literature,

in that case, "This is quite different from the taK on property

I have soma difficulty in that separation of the

13

A

Is that your point, the chapel and

Yes, Your Honor, my point is that the Court in

14

the Murdock case and the Follett case that followed it, in

15

stating that a tax directly upon the activity was unconstitu­

10

tional because it did limit the free exercise provision that
■

17

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Mr. Justic Douglas for,the Court and Mr. Mustice Frankfurter,
in his concurring opinion, expressly distinguished that tax and
the tax that we have here.
Justice Frankfurter said in plain words, "It. is alien
to our constitutional system to suggest that it exempts churchheld land from state taxation,"

In other words, the Court itself

has said very plainly made the distinction from the direct exer­
cise of religion not being subject to a license tax.
And indeed I hardly have to go further and state that
14

1

if this argument were true, would it mean that the great real

2

estate holdings of our church and our TV organisations should

3

be subject to taxes because they are engaged in exercise of the

4

freedom of the press?

church building is used in expressing religion.

various arguments which have been made attempt to excuse it„

an aid to religion as if the taxes were collected and. returned

To me it is an action of the people of this country in

19

recognition of the service and value of religion which has sus­

20

tained this country throughout its various activities.

four times, finding that there was not a substantial Federal

But before I leave the history, I should like to call

7

to the Court's cittention the very real problem that you present

S

the Government in trying to maintain neutrality, neither advanc­

9

ing nor inhibiting.

If you say to the Government, "You must go

10

in the City of New York to St. Patrick’s Cathedral and assess

11

and tax based upon the fair and reasonable market value at the

12

highest use of that property or gowith me to Trinity Church

13

down in Lower Manhattan and tell us to do the same."

15

16

Or any

lyn.
Now it can be done, but in that process what do we

17

do' to the relationship between Government that we are trying to

18

say that there is a separation wall?

19

how much taxes how much taxes we would assess against St. Pat­

20

rick’s or Trinity Church or some of the other areas.

21

It is difficult to imagine

On the other hand, I don’t want to minimize the effect

22

on the little chapel in the community, which proportionately

23

may have as much difficulty or more in meeting this assessment.

24
25

Now how does 200 years of history bear upon that?
It bears upon the fact of the way people live in the pluralism
18

1

of our religion and throughout 200 years of experience in deal­

2

ing with this very problem-

They have nroceeded upon the assumo

3

tion from the earliest day.4, at the very same time that this

4

establishment took place, that they did not have to provide the

5

taxes for their place of worship because it was recognized by

6

the people and their legislatures, and the exemption was granted

7

either in the Constitution or legislation, or both.
Nov/ after 200 years with established parishes and

many difficult financial problems otherwise, and 200 years of

parishioners or move the church someplace that they can afford.

Mr. Rankin, why do you say that this record is

insufficient to decide the issue in this case?

Q

If it is a constitutional question, Mr, Rankin,

3

can the Court be concerned with the iraoacfc in the same way that

4

you would on construction of the statutes where no constitutional

question were involved?

A

6

Well, it seeras tome that it gives the Court

7

guidance and enlightenment insofar as you have information that

or inferences or whatever picture the counsel can portray or

That is what I was calling attention to in regard to

this first point,
Q

This is a field not here under discussionary

15

A

That8s right.

16

The next problem, is I see it, is the assumption in

regard to the system of taxation, and the question of whether

it is an exemption, is the same in the consideration of aid to

religion as it would be if there were a tax.

It seems to me

But beyond that, they says, "Religious institutions do

not pay their fair share of the burden of Government»"

that is not a constitutional criterion»

legislatures have the power and right to decide who shall be
taxed, dependent uoon the question of whether or not two persons

I do not think that if there was a mere exclusion as

to accept that as an added distinction for constitutional pur­

lature could choose various types of persons who are hot simi­

decide not to tax a religious house of worship.

But there is no question but what the Court — the legis­

I would find much more difficulty with regard to

"Just because you are religious,

Mr. Rankin, when I put the question to Mr. Ennis

23

about church-operated schools where religion is regularly

taught, understandably he didn’t want to argue the case he has

here and not some other case, but I wonder if you would care to

1

comment on whether a Court could find such a church-operated

2

school which received tax exemption was not receiving the same

3

kind of “aid to religion" that is argued is now extended to

4

churches .

5

A

Well, it is the position of the City of New York

6

that it is.

7

with all the religions in this country, I do consider one o,f

8

the great assets of this country is the fact wehave varieties

9

in religion, that you can start any religion without interfer­

As I view it'-- I frankly say I am not familiar

But the religions I know, a number of them,

10

ence by Government.

11

all have an inherent part of the religion itself that you shall

12

care for the sick, that you shall care for the orphans and the

13
14
15
16
17
18

elderly.

You shall provide for them.
The ones I know have a mite box or a collection time

after time throughout the year to support those activities.
Some that I know have a Deacon's Fund administered within the
church structure itself to care for the poor and the unfortu­
nate and it is a part of the doctrine and beliefs of the Church.

19

You can go through a whole cross-section of them that people

20

who have that religion will respect it, believe it, and that

21

is part of the doctrine that you not only believe in, but con­

22

tribute to as a part of your worship.

23

the house of worship and the solicitation is made there.

And you conduct that in

Almost evex'y wdek, at least periodically, in many

church there are provisions for their own institutions that
23

?

they maintain, and the parishioners are asked to contribute to

2

them as a part Of their religious beliefs and an obligation as

3

a part of that belief.

4

Q

Your argument,, therefore, I gather, is directed

5

to the' position that as a consequence the Government would not

6

constitutionally be able to finance the church school or the

7

hospital then?
A

8
9

I think that where you finance a church school or

a hospital, you will do it*

Whether this Court will permit it

10

by the Government, it will be in connection with a case like

1!
12

Allen or other situations where you are carrying out the secular
*
functions, aiding secular functions, which is not directly

13

advancing the religion.

14

you can separate out of religion the elements of charity or

15

assistance to education or other aspects that are at the heart

IS

of it and have been for a thousand years.
Q

17

j
But I don’t think that you can say that

So you suggest, I take it, that the Government

18

should make a direct grant to a church to tarry on charitable

activity?

20

A

No, I think you have ruled that of an activity

But what you are arguing now is that you can

out.

21

23

grant tax exemption though, because the churches are engaged

24

in charities?

.

Oh, but the tax exemption is quite different from

It is entirely different by nature under tax laws,

Q

Mr. Rankin, if the appellant were to prevail with

his argument that this constitutes an aid to religion, the

10

establishment of religion, would you see any bearing on that

IS

kind of a ruling and the allowance of deductions for contributions

12

which is now governed by regulations?

would turn to the Federal Government.

I think most of the state

A

Well, I ~~

15

Q

Could that exemption survive if the appellant

16
17

prevailed here?
A

I can see many problems in that area if the

18

appellant were to prevail here, because, as Professor Bitgar

19

develops in his article in the Yale Law Journal, you would have

20

the similar problem with regard to the Internal Revenue Act,

21

the various provisions that, Mr. Chief Justice, you are describ­

22
23
24

ing, and tax laws throughout the Federal structure as to whether
or not if this is aid to education -- aid to religion, that would
not also be aid to religion.

ARGUMENT OF J. LEE RANKIN, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. RANKIN:

7

8
9

Mr. Rankin, you may proceed
(resumed)

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I would like to conclude my argument very briefly.

io

It seems to me that one of the things the Court would like to

u

examine, which I have looked at in connection with this case,

12

is what has happened after 200 years of this exemption with

13

regard to the fears that this Court has described that brought

14

about the provisions in the First Amendment about establishment

15

and free exercise.

16

Have any of those feared conditions that were the

17

basis for these provisions of the First Amendment come about or

18

appear on the horizon in connection with this matter?

19

will recall its reference to various things, the fears that

20

brought about this amendment — the destruction of government,

21

the degradation of religion, persecutions that occurred trying

22

to obtain political and religious supremacy for various reli-

23

gions, the establishment of a particular governmental faith whic

24

was established at about the same time as the exemptions were

25

passed by the legislatures, the various persecutions and the tax

The Court

i

27

?

upon individuals who didn8t support the established church, taxe

2

for the payment of ministers" salaries in churches.

3

There has been at least one case this Court passed

4

upon in regard to taxing to build a church, and it was stricken.

5

And we find none of those particular fears that brought about

6

the amendment that are either present in our situation after 200

7

years or, as I can see it, threaten.

8

in religion of all kinds of beliefs, either of a God or no God,

9

and then you can hardly imagine the range that they cover in

We have a great pluralism

10

this country. ‘As 1 said before, it is one of our great assets.

n

But if you decide to sustain the appeal in this case,

12

we are going to have Government up to its edrs in religions, in

13

religious examination of all these exemptions that are provided

14

in the tax laws for religious institutions, because we will have

15

to know what they make, what their properties are worth, what

16

they claim they are worth.

17

contests like we do with other people in the community about the

18

value of their church property and that the taxes are too high

19

compared with other people, and we will have to know what money

20

they take in --- all of those various thing.

21

We will have all kinds of certiorari

So instead of being neutral, as this exemption permits

22

and provides", we will be so engrossed in religious activities

23

which are the very thing, I submit to you, that the country has

24

been trying to provide against by this amendment and this Court

25

has used such great care to provide and insist upon a separation
28

1

of church and state.

■

:

MR. ENNIS:

5

I would like to read just two statement,

6

if it please the Court, one, that the corporation counsel has

7

gone outside the record to tell the Court some knowledge he has

about the value of Mr. Wals's property and how much his taxes

9

were.

j

I don't have that information and in a five-page affidavit

10

!
in support of the motion for summary judgment, the City of New

11

York, which could easily have the information available about

12

that property, did not choose to make that point.
I think that should be taken into account.

socially undesirable factors in the exemption of church property

19

is that we don't have any idea of ttfhafc the value of such property
