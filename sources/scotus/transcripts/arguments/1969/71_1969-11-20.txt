the Court should decide those question» against us, we believe
that, Greene and McElroy compels reversal here.
Greene and McBXroy, it will be recalled,- did net
require the Court to reach the constitutional issue ? 3.11 the
Ccart. held was that given our presumption 3 r. raver of fair­
ness we would net prsruee that the Congress author:;.an
Ms&aistrativ® agency to dispense with 'these fmd&ment&X
procedural decencies» without an ©impress statement by the
Cc ogress and an express statement by the President of an in**
to at.ion to do so»
And if the Court ware to adopt that pc4,.v:.±on, which
seems to saa sensible and supported by the former decisions of
•the Court, the constitutional issue nesci not he -reached.
However, we do believe thatif the •constitutional
issue must be reached it should be decided in our favor.
Thase regulations in their purpose

their .'Languagef their

administration and their effect, are punitive.

Ever* -the

GoT&rxicisnt cannot evade this issue.inln its brief it asserto
on the one hand that they are not punitive slid it. the Appan**
di;: to its brief it reprints a letter from General Hersrey
to Kamel Rivers which makes their punitive intent' abundantly

clear.
On Page 81, General Hershey says: “The Selective
Service should not be used for punitive purposes.”

If by that

it is meant that one should be inducted into the armed £Greet _

as punishment for an offense which is not related t.o Selective
Service, leaving the regulations tc be applied in that vast
number of Federal offenses which may toe found in the inter­
stices of the Selective Service Act and regulations..
Indeed, the delinquency regulations are far broader
than is necessary to achieve the limited nonpunitive purpose
&hich the Government would ascribe to thesis. Under the regula­
unless h& supplies

tions a registrant is presumed to be 1-.

the board with information about his status.
.properly so*

And perhaps

That compels him to go in there, and tell the

local board what he’s been doing, whether he's entitled to a
deferrment or exemption.
A delinquency system which limited local board
/

discretion and which provided that a registrantIs classifica­
tion was to be frozen and he could be frozen in 1~A, for
example, and that no request for deforcement would be con­
sidered until he started cooperating with the local board in
supplying information if again placed under a limited, nondiscretionary, regulatory scheme, might be nonpunitive, but
taking the further step of priority induction, illustrates, 1
think, the punitive purpose which lies at the base of those

7

.regulations.

general rule-making power.

14

Q

That was my question.

15

A

That would be a different case; yes, Mr»

15

Justice Harlan.
The present scheme with posing in local boards this

n
18

absolute discretion, finds no authorization in the statute

19

and there is no And4 nation that the Congress has ever ex­

20

plicitly -asidi carefully considered it, as It has explicitly and

21

carefully considered every other Federal regulatory §charae that

I know of, which involves the imposition of a sanction of this

character.

13

/

This reading is indeed supported by the only prior

14

Selective Service decision of this Court which is inpoint:

16

board had before it the illegal recommendation by the Depart­

17

ment of Justice that the Petitioner’s conscientious objector

18

claim be not sustained and the Court held that given the

19

presence, though mistaken recommendation that the conviction

20

had to be reversed because it did not affirmatively appear in

21

the Selective Service file? that the board had disavowed the

22
23

unlawful and mistaken views of the Department of Justice.

The final point,/which X would address myself in

oral argument today, leaving the remainder of our rather

technical arguments to our very lengthy brief*, is the

But that aside, repeatedly the Petitioner reported?

3

the Government doesn't deny that.

certain orders by induction canter officials that he submit

He was never given an opportunity to refuse to

\

13

Submitting to induction, as this Court had occasion

14

in Mr. Justice Douglas's opinion to the Court in Billings and

15

Tru@sd.ell, to consider at some length is a well-defined,

16

orderly step in the process of selection of men into the armed

17

forces of the United States»
q

13

19
20

whhfc do you say he did if he did not refuse to

submit to induction.
A

Mr. Chief Justice, there is an offense.

There

is a duty of a registrant to obey the orders of the induction
21

center officials and the failure to perform that duty can be
22
prosecuted under Section 12-A.

We have here, therefore, a case

23
that is on all fours with Stirone against the United States in
24
which the indictment charged a conspiracy respecting the
25
/

11
■

ii

importation of 3©n$ into Pennsylvania and the proof at trial

2

showed a conspiracy involving both the importation of sand

3

and the exportation of steel.

In other words,■ the proof at trial was quite dif­

4
3

ferent fromthe offense with which the Petitioner was charged.

6

Unci X would say that that is a not, inconsiderable problem.

7

Given the large number of these offenses that are being prosecu- ■

8

ted in the courts , it devolves upon the Government with an

S
10

especial burden, I 'chink, to plead with accuracy and above allj
to present to the grand jury all of the facts so that at the

11

time the charge is made there has been a thorough and full

12

consideration of what it is the defendant should be prosecuted

for.'

j

If the man presents himself at the induction

tion or refuses to fill out forms, has he refused to comply
with those induction orders?
A

He has, Mr. Chief, refused to comply with that

part of the induction process that deals with the physical
and mental examination.
Q

Is that an offense under the statute?

A

/
Yes, it -is.

tions of the statuteb

It’s an offense under the regula­

12-A of the Act makes it a crime to

refuse to perform any duty under the regulations.

12

The

1

regulations make it a duty to @§r>pl.y with those orders of

2

induction center officials.

3

Q

Did I understand you to say that he did not

4

re-.fuse hocomply /with induction orders which the statute con­

5

templates to make out an offense?

6

A

No, Mr. Chief Justice, that is not my point.

7

My point is that if he committed any offense at all it was the

8

offense of refusing to obey orders that he take physical and

9

mental examination at -the induction center.

And it was not

10

the offense of which he was indicted? the refusal to submit

11

to induction,, which is a very precisely-defined offense in the

12

Selective Service and Army Regulations which this Court had

13

before it in Billings against Truesdell.

U

Q

And was that raised at the trial?

15

A

The variance question?

16

Q

Yes.

11

A

No, Mr. Chief Justice, it was not raised at the \

18

trial.

19

record in the Court of Appeals that the contention that was

20

focused on was the failure of the indictment to inform the

21

Petitioner of the offense with which he was charged.

22

that this question is fairly compassed within that and itis

23

certainly a question upon which certiorari was granted.

24
25

The .‘issue arose during the trial and X think from the
.

Q

X think

Is it your position that every destruction or

failure to carry a draft card in your possession is an exercise
13

1

of First Amendment rights?

2

A

Hr, Chief Justice, the destruction question, I

3

believe, is foreclosed by the Court'3 decision in O'Brien

4

against the United States.

5

circumstances of this case in which the surrender of the card

6

was a part of a constitutionally-protected course of conduct,

7

that it was a protected First Amendment activity.

8
9

Q

It is our position that under the

That is, assuming that it is surrender — the

act of surrendering falls in that csi.tego.-ZYo

Does that mean

10

that the actor is forever, thereafter excused from complying

11

with the requirement to carry his draft card in his possession?

VI

A

I would say not, Mr. Chief Justice, although it

13

is a question, that had not occurred to me until you asked it.

14

If the board were to sand him another card and if his failure

15

to possess it is unrelated to a course of conduct in which he

IS

is exercising his Finit Amendment right of dissent, then 1

17

think that would be a different case than the one that we have

18

before us.

19

Our point there is that there is a difference, as I

20

believe the Court said in O'Brien, between permanently render­

21

ing one’s certificate unavailable and the abandonment of it.

22

And that there has been by the Government no showing that this

23

conduct by the Petitioner and similar conduct by others across

24

the country has interfered with the operation of-the Selective

25

Service System.

Thus, we do not have a showing by the
14

1

Government that countervailing interest is paramount, cogent;,

2

important, strong or any of the other words which the Court has

3

used in defining the permissible scope of limitations of

4

speech and nonspeech conduct when they are brigaded together.
Q

5

Is it the duty of the board to send somebody

6

another card when it learns that that person's card has been

7

alleged by third parties that that parson's card has been

8

lost, or destroyed?
A

9
10

According to regulations, Mr. Justice Stewart,

no statement that the board has such a duty.
Q

11

X suppose a registrant who loses his card

12

through his own negligence or carelessness dr because it was

13

stolen or something, that he can apply and get a new one;

14

can't he?
A

13

He can get a new one.

The difficulty —

16

another, difficulty with these regulations, of course, is that

17

if the board gets a card which the registrant has lost it has

13

no way of knowing the reason why he's abandoned it and there

19

is no provision under the regulations to give him a hearing.

20

Indeed, in this record the beard never had any evidence that

21

the Petitioner surrendered his card.

aren't even in the file. X don't know where they are.

23

only evidence the board had was the United States Attorney*^

Q

Well, that was hearsay evidence but - there is no"
15

1

dispute about what did happen, is there, in this case?

2

3

A

There is no dispute, no»

But 1 think it under­

scores one of the dangers in this regulatory scheme, sir.

4

Q

X wonder do they need a regulation of any kind

5

to guide the boards in what to do if

6

under some lost and found process.

7

to tell the board to send that card to the registrant again?

And if the actions of the hoard werelimited to sending,

10

the card-back to the registrant we wouldn't have the case we

11

have.

12

It6 s only -when the board seeks to use the coming into

13

its office of the card as the predicate for depriving of.a

14

benefit conferred,/by the statute and regulations that a quite

15

serious congressional authorization and -due process problem is

16

raised.

17

Q

Would it make a difference in that situation
• .

.

.

IS

whether the board was aware that there had been a deliberate

19

disposition of the card as compared with an inadvertent loss

20

of the card?

i

I
I

21

A

Mo, Mr. Chief Justice, it would not make a

22

difference, unless that determination were made after the kind ;

23

of adversary hearing which this Court has in other casas in­

24

volving imposition of sanctions regarded as indispensable.

25

Q

Well, do I understand you to be suggesting that

A

4

It is our position that the regulations are

invalid for failure to provide such a hearing.

seems reasonable that if the board is going to take away the

MR. RUCKELSHAtJS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

I think $gain today we find ourselves at

10

the outset faced with the same problem that we faced at the

11

outset of the Breen, case.

12

Breen and Gutknecht, throughout the briefs filed by the

'13

Petitioners in both cases and throughout the amicus briefs

14

filed in both cases, there is this overtone or undertone of

13

accusation against the Selective Service System focused in on

16

the Hershey directive, somehow implying that the reason people '•

17

are being declared •— registrants are being declared delinquent

13
19

in this country coday is because of their protest activities.
\
Now, 1 don8t happen, to believe that that is true.

20

However, even if it is true, it has not been proven in either

21

one of these cases.

And that is that throughout both

|

22

■,

Let ms give just one fact that was omitted.

On

24

December 20th Mr. Gutknecht was declared delinquent. The
i.
Hershey directive was issued in October. On December 9th at

Breen is reprinted -fee joint statement of then Attorney Genera]

2

Ramsey Clark and General Hersliey, specifically repudiating the

3

idea that any registrant could be inducted or his induction

4

could he accelerated because of his beliefs? because of any

protest activity unrelated to any violation of the delinquency

regulation that ha engaged in.

Certainly we don’t sit to pass judgment on whether the large

It seems to me that would he the narrowest one?

A

X think that’s correct, Hr. Justice Douglas»

17

They have launched their brief," a rather massive attack on the

18

delinquency regulations themselves, saying that they are not

19

authorised by statute that even if they were authorised -the

20

statute is so vague as to be devoid of standards.

21

Q

1 spent a lot of timein the Oestereich case

22

reading a brief filed by the Solicitor General and it seemed to

23

me that the attack made by this Petitioner is more massive than

24

the made by the Solicitor General who 1 see is absent from this

25

particular brie£.

20

A

\

Wellp Mr. Justice Douglas, the Solicitor General

2

in his brief in Oastereieh suggested that sound arguments

3

could be made along the lines that Petitioner here makes them.

I think that if there is any disagreement it..would be that I

5

would delete the word "sound.”

7

believe they are sound.

they are not.

1 think an argument can be

In our brief we relate why we believe

9

Q

I think you*re protected by the First Amendment.

10

A

Mr.Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;

11

the Court, below decided this question on rather narrow grounds

12

on the validity of the delinquency regulations in acceleration

13

within a class? within the class in this case, 1-A. 1 think

14

that question is covered in our brief, but 1 think the overall

15

of the validity of the delinquency regulations, as far

16

as reclassification is concerned, is what is either going to be

17

before this Court in this case if they decide not to take it on

18

the narrow grounds or will be in some other cases that are

19

pending here on petition for certiorari and for that reason I

20

think this argument can best be had in terms of the broader

21

question.

22
23
24
25

Q

What would happen if in this case the man had hac.

his draft card stolen from him or burned or lost»
A

If it were burned without his consent or without

his knowledge, I think clearly, Mr. Justice Marshall, that if

21

this happened and it came to the board's attention and they —

?

Q

2

Well, suppose it didn't come to the board's

3

attentions the only thing that came to the board's attention

4

was he didn't have his card.

5

—• not probable, but is it possible that a board could accel­

6

erate him?
A

7

Under these regulations is it

I think it is possible that a board could do so

8

but I think if they did, Mr. Justice Marshall, it would foe a

9

clear abuse of their discretion.

10

And if this is what had

‘ happened in this case we would not. be here in this Court today.
>v

Q

Why not?

A

Because we would have confessed error prior to

■11

12

13
14

corning here.
X think if, under our interpretation of the regula­

15

tions, if a regulation is violated by inadvertence or by mis­

16

take of a registrant and -the board attempts to accelerate him

17

under a strict reading of the regulations that this is a clear

18

abuse of discretion on the part of the board? that it is only

19

willful violations on the part of registrants and not only

20

willful, but violations in which the registrant shows no desire

21

to come back into compliance again with the regulations.

22

Q

Was he ever offered a new draft card?

23

A

K@ was never offered a new draft card, Mr.

24
25

Justice Marshall.
Q

Was it ever suggested that he apply for one?

22

t

?

A

But on Page 44 of the Appendix is a copy of the

2

delinquency notice that was sent to Mr, Gutkriecht inthis case

3

and in that delinquency notice in paragraph two it says: "You

4

are hereby directed to report to the local board immediately

S

in person or by mail or to take this notice to ’the local board

6

nearest you for advice as to what you should do.

1

Now, Mr. Gutkhecht did not do that.

He says that

because five days later he was reclassified.* that this, in

9

effect, did not give him the amount of notice that he needed tc

bring himself back into compliance.

11

back into compliance by showing a willingness tcpossess his

12

cards at any time prior to induction or certainly prior to the

13

notice of induction.

14

would have been abusing its discretion by not permitting him

15

to come back into compliance.

IS

1 think

If he had tried to get

that again, clearly the board

This is consistent with our theory of the delinquency

17

regulations not being punishment, but being remedial in their

18

effect.

Q

The regulations don't give any of that pro­

tection, it leaves it up to the board.

A

Wall, 1 respectfully would state, Mr. Justice —

22

Q

That*3 the point that worries me is if the

23

25

authority that the board has is uncontrolled authority.

Well, the board is given discretion without

question under the regulations.

be abused.

A

Absolutely, Mr* Chief Justice»

This is our

position; this is our position that this is clearly what is

13

intended by the regulations themselves when they say that the

classification may be reopened at any time without regard to

The question ©£ punishment that Mr* Justice Marshall
addressed himself to yesterday, I think is verymuch involved
in this case as to whether or not the delinquency regulations
themselves amount to punishment «aid acceleration and that if it
doss amount W> pwilsiltimnt p is it done so without due process or
the Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment guarantees?

27

Vioi-3, yesterday when I juut mentioned i» passing
your question, !*lr„ Justice Marshal"..- about what the punishment
questio» that bothered you that there may foe elements of
punishment in the delinquency regulations; the counsel ‘jumped
with glee in his .gefoutfeal- &gxms£ftfc that 1 was willing to admit
that there may toe elements of punishment, but I think that
really it would do this Court a little good to get into the
semantical argument of just exactly what amounts to punishment.;
It is our position on Page 39 and following of our

;I

brief that some of the indicia of legal punishment are present
here just as they were outlined in the .Seanedy-Mendosa case,
Among those indicia that are outlined in that case are the
sanctions that are here ultimately £m*olvecl' in affirming a
disability.

He is going tc be restrained if lie is; in the

a any*
Secondly, it cases into play only in the finding of
cienterre (?) *

This is in line with our theory that there has

to be a willful violation of the regulations and a willful
l

refusal to corns back into compliance with the regulations
before the board has properly exercised its discretion in
declaring someone delinquent.
Thirdly, -the behavior to which it applies is already
a crime and this is true in this case,.
a violation of the regulations*

It is already a crime,

Doss it promota one of the

traditional aims of punishment in deterrents and retributions

i

which were named in the' Kennedy-Mendoza case,

2

while there are some questions about the deterrents as being

3

only used and only defined in terms of punishment, but there

4

are the deterrent aspects of this.

5

But there are indicia th&tdo not point to punishment

as outlined in the Kerniedy-BHendozo

10

involved.

Andl think the delinquency regulations do have an

11

alternative purpose..

The purpose of the regulation is,

•

12

essentially, twofold.

It's to induce cooperation with the

13

Selective Service System on the part of all draft eligible

14

men and this is where the civil contempt analogy comes in.
'

If we are trying to define this in a remedial sense;

Otherwise it would be an abuse of

tod in this case the purpose of the regulations was

22

to cure what has happened and not to punish what has happened.

23

And just as in the Troutman case we have confessed error and

29

effort was

made to cure the' error.

The second purpose of the — this is a nonpenal

purpose — is the maintenance of- the. none? si induent morale of

Alternative purpose of the statute, but as I said at the

8

beginning, X think to -get into an order (?;■■ in this Court about
J

9
10

whether this amounted to legal punishment might really cause
the Court to miss the point.
•

■

Because the point inthis case

■

11

is: why are we talking about punishment?

12

punishment in terns o£ the delinquency regulations to find

13

out whether he has beendeprived of due process or his Fifth

14

and Sixth Amendment rights.

15

We are talking about

And what is, in this case, the punishment of which

i

16

Mr. GufcJcnecht, the Petitioner complains, it is that accelerated

17

induction,,

18

inducted in an accelerated matter he has the right to refuse

19

20

induction just as he did here and thereby submit himself to
in
a criminal prosecution/which the has the full panoply of Fifth

21

and Sixth Amendment rights.

This is what he complains of and before he can be

I

22

And X think that tills is a clear distinction between j

23

this case and the case in Kendoza-MartinOs where the Court went:

24

into the admittedly difficult question of what amounts to

25

punishment and what doesn't.

30

|

Because Fir. Mendoza was never _ |

1

given & hearing; he was donations. l:isodhe left the country

He. had no right to a hearing to contest that j

and having left he was' immediately j

!

4

donation air.nation and there was no way he could bring up a

5

contesting of his rights and the. Court there said that that

6

was punishment without the due process of Fifth

7

amendment rights which he should have.

8
9

i

and Sixth

1 think we can draw an analogy between what has
happened here and a grand jury proceeding,

.When a man id

11

indicted under a grand jury proceeding he is in.'a very real
‘
sense, punished* He may be put in jail if he's indicted and

12

without bail in a non-bailable offensa or bail, may be set so

13

high that he can't meet it and he stays there*

14

of his Fifth'or Sixth amendment rights and probably little dee ;

15

process at. that time.

10

18

He has had none!

But in this case where the board itself has found himi

17

delinquent because he violated one of the regulations, I say

m

the analogy between this and the grand jury is very close.

m

And secondly, as far as the board hearing itself is

20

concerned if he la given notice of the delinquency itself, the

21

notice that 1 read right on Page 44 of the Appendix, where it

22

says come in and let us tell you how we can show you how to

23

avoid a further delinquency,

24

j

I

in this case — in my estimation,:

I

although it is contested by the Petitioner, if hs had asked for?
i

*>C
iM+J

a hearing he would have been given one.

31

There ""is no evidence

1

that he asked for a hearing in this case because what was there

2

tc hear?

3

tc hear whether he is willing to take them back or not. There

4

is no fact situation for the board to hear,

regulation which Mr, Gutknecht violated and under that

6

tion it is within the discretion of the board to apply the

7

delinquency regulations

He had turned in his draft card,

They are not going

Thera is a clear
'regula­

which they did In this case.

8

Now, again under our theory he would have the right

9

to purge himself from this violation and 1 think had he show?*

30

j

12

a. desire-to do so and the board had refused to let him do it
*
we would have been the first to confess error.
But he mad® no j
j
effort to do that and in this case I submit that there is no

13

fact situation with which this Court could focus on to sav

34

whether the procedure of due process in the hearing at the

15

board level has been violated»

I
16

Now', I submit that the Kennedy-Mendo2a analysis is
}

17

simply not Sufficient in this case to determine that what we'roj
.

18

talking about is legal punishment»

I think there are some
j

13

differences, but even if you find that the line between punish*i

20

■
ment and nonpunishment; if you find this falls slightly over

21

the line toward punishment, I thinkthat even if that is true,

'22

23

he has been given at one stage at the end of this process ail.
•'
of his 'Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. He has been given

24

the complete due process,

25

j
J

I

Q

That is in this criminal trial, you mean?

32

I
A

Yes, that*» right, Mr. Justice Stewart.

This

2

is the statutory framework that the Congress has set up whereby

3

this man can raise his rights and there, is no such statutory

4

framework in the Mendesa situation.

:

/

The othex argument of the Petitioner was in their

5

6

brief that even if it wasn't punishment we have not provided-

7

the procedure of due process fchatis necessary.

8

in pointing out that he did receive notice it is our conten­

8

tion that a fair reading of the regulations would be that he

And I think

10

could receive a hearing if he so requested.

Now, this is a

1?

completely speculator/ question before this Court because he

12

didn't request -a hearing, either before he received the

13

delinquency notice or after he received his reclassification

14

and I don't see how he can"be heard to complain here when he

15

has not

for a hearing.

16

As fax* as the variance between the charge- and the

17

proof is concerned, 1 think that it is fairly stated in the

18

brief and I think that question, plus the argument that the

19

affidavit itself or the indictment itself was duplicitous,

20

borders on the frivolous.

21

which X think clearly point out the questions involved.
