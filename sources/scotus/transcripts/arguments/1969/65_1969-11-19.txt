The question presented in this case, 1 think, can be

fairly reduced to the following:

Whether in the lights of this

10

Court's decisions in Oestereich and Gabriel, Section 10 (b)(3)

11

of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 precludes pre-

12

induction judicial review, of delinquency

13

cesses by a local draft board against a fulltime undergraduate

14

student, who is statutory entitled to a II-S classification

15

because he surrendered Ills draft card to a clergyman to regis­

IS

ter his dissent against the war in Vietnam.

n
18

To put it another way, the question is that does
Oestereich control this case or does Gabriel control it?
The facts in the case are admitted for purposes of
j

20

this appeal and are rurther agreed to in the agreed statement

21

on appeal which is part of the aooendix.

22

time in question was was a 19-year-old undergraduate student at

23

the Berkeley School of Music in 1967, a school located in Bos­

24

The petitioner at the

At that time he was satisfactorily pursuing

a fulltime course of instruction at the college and was properly

j

I

classified by his local board, Board No, 16 in Bridgeport, Con­

2

necticut,, as a II-'S for the academic year 1967-1968.
At enrollment time the petitioner maintained the

3
-><9

necessary status for IX-S in full compliance with all of the

5

statutory requirements,

6

along with numerous others took part in a meeting at the Arling­

7

ton Street Church in Boston, protesting the war in Vietnam, and

8

in the course of this meeting delivered his registration certifi

9

cate along with a number of other registrants to a clergyman

10

for the sole purpose of registering his dissent against the

11

war in Vietnam.

On November 16, 1967, the petitioner

12

The action by the petitioner was peaceful, it was

13

nonviolent and it was expressed freedom of speech under the

M

First Amendment,
A few weeks prior to this occasion a memorandum and

15

16
17

21

22
23
24
25

letter was issued from the Director of Selective Service,
General Hershey, which was addressed to all members and offi­
cials of the Selective Service System.

This memorandum and

letter, which we will hereinafter refer to as "the Hershey
directive," instructed and advised the members of the system to ;
strip deferments and exemptions from all registrants who in any
way violate the Selective Service regulations or its related
processes, or who take part in any so-called illegal demonstra­
tions .

The Director further recommended that the delinquency
3

?

reclassification induction procedure be pursued for any regis­

2

trant who abandoned his draft card or his classification card..

3

Subsequent to the action by the petitioner, on January 9, 1969,

4

he received a simultaneous declaration of delinquency and

5

reclassification in the mail, reclassification from I.T-S to X-aJ

6

This was a clear implementation of the directive of General

7

Hershey and as the court below artfully put it, "It was certain!

3

in line with this directive."

!
!
.

The ground set forth in the delinquency notice was

9

' '

!

io

"failure to have registration certificate in your possession.”

Two days later the petitioner was ordered for a ohysiccil examine'.!

tion and in early February of 1968 he appealed the classifica­

13

tion,

The litigation below was commenced on February 20

14
15

1968, in the District Court for Connecticut•wherein a declara­

16

tory judgment and injunction and other relief was asked by way

17

of a remedy in behalf of the petitioner to go with other forms

18

of relief, including damages.
The initial hearing before that court took place on

19

|

{

20

March 1, 1963, where a temporary restraining order was obtained.:
f

21

However, on March 8, 1968, all of the petitioner’s claims for

22

relief were denied, the temporary restraining order was dis­

23

solved and the respondent's motion to dismiss was granted pri­

24

marily on the ground that 10(b)(3) deprived the District Court

25

of jurisdiction

.

On April 30, 1968, subsequent to the litigation, the

1

Appeal Board for Connecticut confirmed the classification of the

petitioner' s I-A.

?5

IQ

in the failure of the majority in its opinion to identify the

17

case, as it should have, with Oestereich, rather than with

18

Gabriel-*

i
\

19

We submit that the Oestereich case clearly and unmis­

20

takably controls the case at bar and we submit this initially

2!

for factual reasons because the salient facts in both Oestereich

22

and in the case at bar are absolutely identical in at least

23

seven respects.

24
23

In the first place, both cases involve fulltime under­
graduate students.

Second, both involve the surrender of draft

-

1

cards as a conscientious dissent fay personal commitment against

2

the war in Vietnam.

Third, both involve explicit and unquali­

fied statutory rights at stake in both cases.
4

Fourth,, there is
i
in neither case any discretion or any exercise of judgment or

5

weighing of evidence by the local board.
Fifthr both involve the application of the delinquency1

regulations directly pursuant to the Hershey directive.

Sixth, !

the registrants in both cases were puniiively reclassified I-A
pursuant to that directive.

And seventh, there was a simultan­

eous- declaration in both casas of delinquency and a X-A reclassij
ffication.
Petitioner submits that the facts in Gabriel was not
f
reconcilable with any single one of those ■Seven factual elements
in Geatereich and Breen, and for that reason Gabriel is irrele­
vant to the consideration of the case at bar.
We submit by way of legal argument that the exemption

17

deferment distinction which was drawn by the court below and

18

on which heavy emphasis is placed by the respondents is totallv

13

unsupported in at least four respects.

20

!

In the first place, it is unsupported by the legisla- !
;

n

tive history of the statute which reflects the congressional

22

intent in passing the Military.Selective Service Act of 1967.

i
'

23
24
25

t

Secondly, it is unsupported by the wording of the statute itself .
Thirdly, it is unsupported by the wording of the Selection
Service regulations.

And fourthly, it is unsupported by the
6

1

pertinent and relevant case law by Court of Appeals decision

2

below*
The legislative history of this statute is extensively

3
4

described in both the Senate and the House reports up to the

5

passage of this Act and, in particular, on House Report Mo. 67,

6

which stresses the importance in the passage of the new Act of

7

immunizing fulltime undergraduate students from any disruption

3

of their education by way of untimely induction and stressing

&

further the fact that this was in the public interest for this,

10

clear and unmistakable immunity to apply.
There was a very distinct effort on the part of both

11
12

the House and the Senate to remove local board discretion based

13

on class standing in favor of what is described in the legisla­

14

tive history as a ’’uniform deferment policy with a statutory and

15

clearcut criteria for all undergraduate student deferments.”

And also significant, and I intend to go back to this

16

17

later on, the new statute in 1967 removes the discretionary

13

term "authorize," "the President is authorized” to grant student

19

deferments and replaces it with the mandatory word "shall" and

20

further goes on to remove the further discretionary language in

21

the old Act which talked about authorizing deferments Only when

22

necessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety or

do

interest.

24
25

That was removed *
And what we now have in the statute are 'five clearcut

statutory criteria, leaving no discretion to the local boards

7

1

whatsoever that these criteria are met, namely, that a II~S

a

be granted in the following instances?

3

wil

First, that the student is pursuing a fulltime course

4

of instruction; second, that he is attending a college or uni­

3

versity or a similar institution of higher learning? third, that

6

he is pursuing a course of instruction satisfactorily? fourth,,

7

that he has not yet obtained a baccalaureate degree? and fifth,

a

that he has not attained his 24th birthday.

9
10
ft

12

n
14
15

These are the clearcut statutory criteria set forth by
the Congress deliberately and intentionally so that there should!
be no mistaking about when a student was or was not entitled to j
I
his deferment. And as far as the case at bar is concerned,
,
there xs no question, it is not contested that Mr. Breen met

i
I

every single one of these criteria.
The national policy and the statutory criteria are

IS

further reflected in the specific restriction upon the President

17

which was also introduced in the 1967 statute and vas nonexistent

IS

prior to that time, but shall deferment shall not be restricted

19

or terminated without a specific finding by the President that

20

the needs of the Armed Forces require such action of the courts.
i

21

There has been no such finding by the President of chs:

22

United States, so that taking all of these elements together.

23

it is not surprising that the dissenting opinion opinion below

24

pointed out that this is about as clear a statement of congressi

25

intent as you can gat, made all the more specific -- or made all

8

emphatic, £ather, by its appearance in the Selective Service

Act for the first time in the .1367 amendment.

concerned, further buttressed in the following way by a very

In talking about these changes, this is what the repos

10

says at 1359 of the House Report Mo. 267:

"The language incar- j

graduate student deferments and provides them uniformly to all

17

or reach the age of 24, whichever occurred first."

order to

<■

I submit there is no question about the legislative
intent here.

20

Now the other main prop of respondent's argument has

21

to do with the proposition that an exemption registrant, as in

22

Oestereich, is somehow outside the system, outside the Selective

23

Service System entirely, and it quotes a Court of Appeals deci­

24

sion, Anderson against Hershey, in support of this .rationale.

f

If Oestereich, a divini

had finished his divinity school at the seminary, and

having completed his school then decided that he was going to
enter law school or that he decided that he then was going to
drive a bus or become a carpenter, can there be any question at
all that he would be outside the system simply because he a

Let’s reverse this situation.

Music or even while he was there, he transferred to a divinity

under the statute as well as under the regulation that any

it is nowhere to be found.

And that is true.

the exemption deferment demarcation line which the Government
*
I
tries so desperately to draw, particularly after Oestereich, is
almost impossible to define when examining the various kinds of
classifications which exist both under the statute and the regu­
lation, when one moves from classifications as IV-F, which is

56

an exemption, and I-Y, which is an exemption, and then moves

17

on to I-D, which is a deferment, there is no logical order of

18

priority, there is no systematic attempt to say that we have a

19

series of exemptions which are going to be treated in one

20

fashion exclusively, a series of deferments which are going to

21

be treated in another fashion exclusively, and not not one is

22

in the higher order of priority and one in.the lower order of

priority.

i

j

Indeed, the regulations themselves show a mixture of
j

of priority at I-A down the lowest order of priority, which is
11

!

I-C.
Another example, I think, time example to illustrate

2
3

this point would be in the case of Federal judges, who under

4

the statute and under the regulations have deferments.

5

judges obviously are appointed for life, but he only has a defer­

6

ment.

3
3
10

Federal

Nov/ is it going to be suggested by the Government that
a Federal judge is somehow or other inside the system and a
divinity student at the Andover-Newton Theological Seminary is
somehow or other outside the system?

It makes no sense.

There

is no rational distinction recognised by either the statuti; or
11

12
13

by the regulation.
And I think that the three Justices of this Court who

14

filed their dissenting opinion in Oestereich as much as said ■.

IS

so, particularly as indicated in footnote 9 of their opinion,

IS

this Was also practically conceded by counsel for the Selective

17

Service System in the brief for the Solicitor General filed in

13

the Oestereich case, calling the Court's attention particularly

19

to the footnote on page 68.

20

confession that you couldn't draw these fine distinctions.

21

Q

There again there was practically aj

In your brief, I think you state that the Vice

22

President of the United States is given an explicit deferment.

23

Is that a deferment?

24

A

That is a deferment.

23

Q

He is deferred?

12
i

1

A

z

Q

As long as he is Vice President?

3

A

As long as he is Vice President he only has a

4

deferment.

S

he has.

Yes, sir, that is a deferment,

That would be under classification IV-B.

That’s all

He has no exemptions,

8

Q

That is also true of the members of this Court'?

7

A

That’s true of members of this Court,

3

(Laughter.5

9

All of the members of this Court have are deferments

10

and they are not exempt, at least not specifically under IV-B,

fi

if that is the classification.
Now the distinction, I think, which needs to be drawn

12

13

and obviously some line in this case as in so many other cases

U

before this Court should be drawn, is not between exemptions,

15

on the one hand, and deferments, on the other, but rather between

16

those exemptions and deferments which are unequivocably and unco t

n

ditionally granted by statute on the one side, such as veterans,

18

such as sole surviving sons, such as fulltime students, elected

19

officials and the like, so you have exemptions and deferments

20

there.

21

They are subject to exercise of judgment fay local board

22
23

and the weighing of evidence.

24

25

And those exemptions and deferments which are granted by

Where again you have got exemptions and deferments
such as

in the case of IV-F's, in the case of conscientious

13

fu

I

objectors, in the case of dependency and hardship deferments.

2

As a matter of fact, I would submit that the Gabnex case xt'self

3

is a prime estgJaple to illustrate this point where you are deal­

4

ing with a conscientious objector which involves an exemption.

5

If he is entitled to conscientious objector status, that would

S

be an. exemption.
And yet you have got so clearly a case there that

7
8

there has got to be discretion exercised by the board and there

9

has to be a weighing of the evidence.

ti
Q

10

Would you care to — maybe you have done it, but

1?

I didn*t get it.

Would you care to state your views as to the

12

scope of the discretion of the Secretary or the Director —■

13

Secretary, I guess it is — under this student deferment statute»
■

A

14

I think that the scope of his discretion would be

15

limited only to the Statutory criteria.

15

way of the local board that a student is not pursuing a full­

17

time course of instruction.

18
1.9

The Director finds -by

That might be a factual determina-

'cxorx a
Or if he finds that he is not pursuing that course of

20

instruction satisfactorily, which are the statutory criteria,

Z\

then I would certainly say that it would be a basis for weighing,

22

for a judgment, for a discretionary act by the local board which
i

23

24
25

may, indeed, be barred by 10(b)(3).
But certainly where there are criteria totally irrele­
vant to the statutory criteria, such as in the case at bar, the

14

1

only basis for doing what the board did. ..and this is conceded;

2

is the turning over of a registration certificate to a clergy­

3

man by way of an expression of dissent; but that has nothing to

4

do with the statute and at that point the Selective Service

S

Director cannot do anything about taking away a II-S classifi­

0

cation ,

7
8
9
10
11

The final point that I would like to make so I can
reserve a little time for later on, if the Court please, is that
,
j
the cases cited by the Government , the three Court of Appeals
cases cited by the Government give us small comfort — give us
no comfort in attempting to arrange for what is obviously a

12

divorce of convenience, as between the exemption, on the one

13

side,, and the deferment, on the other.

14

13

is
17

18
19
20
21

22
23

The Kolden case which it cites by dictim was in full
accord with the position of the petitioner in this case.

There

is a clear and rather repeated dictim indicating that 10(b)(3)
would not be a bar in Kolden where a fulltime undergraduate •
student was involved.
The Kraus case, involving a III-A deferment, governed
by statutory language, authorizing — not mandating but author­
ising the President to grant a deferment subject to certain
conditions in 6(h)(2), is again not. applicable.
And in Anderson against Hershey, which they cite in

24

their brief, that is again the rationale that an exemption

28

is outside the Selective Service Service, which we have already
15

?

2

dealt with.
The cases that we have cited, I think, are terribly

o

important, particularly the Carey case, which was decided in

4

the Second Circuit.

S

decision in which two of the three judges in that case ironically,

6

and perhaps incongruously, held that 10(b)(3) would not be a

7

bar to a review, of-. & denial of a X-S classification and set fortl

8

that where is no basis for withdrawing if and where there is .a

It is important because it was a per curiam

I

9
10
11
12
13

statutory grant, it cannot be taken away by the Selective Service!
System, if... there ts a legal relationship involved, as there was
in Carey, and where there is a statutory interpretation that
should be applied, as there was in that case*
This is not a matter for the local boards nor is it

14

a matter to await a conduct prosecution, but that it is a matter

IS

which is entitled to early judicial review?.

IS

Q

Was 'that subsequent to this decision?

17

A

X am sorry.

A

Yes, subsequent to Breen decision.

22

j
That's right,

Mr. Justice Harlan.

23

Q

Different panel?

24

A

A different panel, but interestingly enough of the

23

three judges on that panel, two of them -— Judges Moore and
16

Friendly —- are in the majority in Breen.

2

I would like to reserve the rest for ray rebuttal.

ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM D. RUCKELSHAUS, ESQ.

11

ON BEHALF of respondents

12

13
14

MR. RUCKELSHAUS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
At the outset. I think in light of the statement of fact

15

by the counsel for petitioners it might be well to state in the

16

Government's opinion what this case is not about.

17

In our opinion this case is not about the advisability
j

18

of the war in Vietnam, it is not about the advisability of preset)

19

Selective Service laws.

20

policy for the Legislative and Executive Branches of Government,

21

Quite obviously these are questions of

Thirdly, I think that this case is not about free

22

speech or the challenge to free speech under the Hershey directi’;!

23

There was a specific finding by the Court below in this case to

24

which petitioner did not object and which Is set out on page 4

25

of our appendix, finding of fact No. 5, which states that the

On page 3 in the statement of facts agreed to by the petitioner

and. the Government, in this case there is a statement at the

4

bottom of paragraph 14 that the attached memorandum of decisions

containing the following findings of fact which are not in dis-

6

pute and the following conclusions of law.

■I

There is no dispute about that finding in this case»

j
I

The same question arises in the Gutknecht case which will follow
this one, and there is also a specific finding in the Gutknecht

10

case that there is no evidence that the acceleration was based

11

on the expressions to the opposition to the war in Vietnam,
New I think that the claims of the denial of First

12

S3

Amendment freedom in this case cannot be based upon pure specula-;
i

i

14

fcion ©r on what might have been done»

They must be based on the

13

fact situation as we find it in this case, which I think leads

16

to a complete denial that there was any abridgement of First

17

amendment freedoms in this case.
Here, as the counsel for the petitioner stated, in his

13
1

opening argument, there was not an effort on the part of the local

20

draft beard to implement the Hershey directive in this case

21

applying the delinquency regulations and accelerating Mr. Breen's

22

induction.

23

Hershey directive was issued in October, under the statement ©f

24

facts in this case it is clear that the petitioner was declared

23

delinquent on January 0 and in our appendix, Appendix B to the

I think that it should foe pointed out that while the

i

brief of the Government on page 41 e XS 3. joint statement of

2

Attorney General Ramsiy Clark and the Director of the Selective

3

Service, in which it was stated that lawful protest activities,

4

whether directed to the draft or other national issues, do not

5

subject registrants to acceleration or any other special adrainisj

6

trative action by the Selective Service System.

*

This statement is fully supported by the present Justice

7

8

Department and we would hbt be here if the Department were of the

9

opinion that in this instance Mr. Breen was denied his First

10

Amendment, rights or that the board below acted in derrogation of

11

those rights, that he was accelerated for his views.

Because it was reported to them apparently by the

that out.
Q

Well, isn3t it interesting that out of all the

people they should pick, him?
A

Well, I think that anyone that violates a regula­

5

tion of this nature, when it comes to the attention of the local

S

board,, would be accelerated»

7

Q

And you consider that handing in of his registra-

8 Jtion certificate was not a form of expression?
9

A

Wall, 1 think it is a form of mixed expression and

20

conduct, and under the cases in this Court there is a mixture

11

and where there is a valid Government purpose to be had in the

12

regulation which is violated — in this case, the possession of

13

his draft card — that he cannot violate a law or regulation and

14

call it "speech" and -thereby exonerate himself from any sanctions,

13

under that law or regulation.

t

IS

Q

Bo you mean sanction or punishment?

17

A

Well, 1 will get to that, Mr. Justice Marshall,

18

and I will address myself —•

19

Q

I would appreciate it now, if you care to.

20

A

The question of punishment, as far as it is con-

21

cerned in this case, involvas the — and it also involves the

22

case that follows — as to whether the delinquency regulations

23

are punishment,

24

whether if they are punishment, that he should have been provideo

25

his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights under that.

And the question that we directly face is»,

20
I

think there is a threshold question in this case of

1

Section

0(b)(3) , but if you desire —-

3

Q

I think that is part of the question in this case.

4

A

Yes, Ifeink it is.

5

Q

Can you get to the other question or at least part

A

1 think that is right, Hr. Justice Stewart.

6
7
8

9
10

of it
The

!
t
threshold question is the one to which the petitioner's attorney!
directed most of his attention.
I believe, Mr. Justice Marshall, that the questionof

5

punishment will be covered in great, detail in the next case and j

12

I think that if you take the straight question of punishment

3

itself, that probably there are elements of punishment in what

4

happened here to the petitioner and there are arguments that can

3

be made that it is not punishment.

16

think that this tends to obscure the underlying issue,

7

and that is whether ultimately the petitioner in this case is

?8

able to be afforded his full Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.

9

It is our position that both in this case and in Oestereich that

20

what has happened with

0 (b} (3) is that the raising of those

21

rights has simply been delayed.

22

to raise — all of us have the right to counsel, the right to

23

confrontation of witnesses.

24

submit to induction and at the criminal trial, or submits to

23

induction and brings

He has not been denied the right

This is done when he refuses to

habeas corpus to contest his induction.
2

1

So that the question of whether or not it is punishment

2

or not is only relevant in terms of whether he eventually receive :S

3

his right, that he claims ha should have*

4

The threshold question, of course, is the question of

5

10 (b)C3).

8

that this case should be dismissed under 10(b)(3),

7

contention that that decision by the Court of Appeals and District

8

Court below was proper.

9

The District Court and the Court of Appeals thought
It is our

I
)

The Section 10(b)(3) clearly prohibits judicial review

10

of classification gmd processing by local appeal boards, and 'that!

1?

the questions of classification and processing can only be

\z

brought up as a defensa to a criminal trial or by habeus corpus.
Mow I don't believe that Oestereich is dispositive of

13
14

this case..

15

drawn between a deferment and an exemption which are relevant to

16

Section 10(b)(3) and it is our contention that this section does

17

apply'here.

18

I think there are some distinctions which can be

In the first place, X think the purpose of 10(b)(3) is

19

twofold:

20

with the Selective Service process, and 1 think the congressional

21

purpose here was not to deny review, but to postpone it.

22

think that the Selective Service process, if it is to go on smocith-

23

ly, that Section 10(b)(3) and the purpose behind it must be at

24

least applied to the situation as it exists in deferments.

25

Its first purpose is to avoid a litigious interruption

And I

Mow I think that the petitioner can raise, in all the

22

1

defenses that he has tophis treatment at the end of the process»

2

There is historical validity to the finality decision of an

3

appeal board and we have decisions cited in our brief in FaXbo

4

and Estep,which modified the decision in Falbo, which said that

5

all of these defenses of the board exceeding its jurisdiction

6

by not having any basis in fact for its decision could be brought

7

up at a criminal trial.

8

J

j

So what I believe has happened in Section 10 (b) '(3)
.

9
10

is not a denial of review, but a postponement, and that thdre isj
historical validity for that postponement.
'

11

The second purpose that the Section 10(b){3) has is to i

12

avoid having the courts becoming super draft boards, and cer­

13

tainly that if Section 10 £b < (3) were not to apply to deferments

14

to anybody who is deferred, the courts would be flooded with

15

cases involving interpretation of draft board decisions, not only

16

as far as they might be considered blatantly lawless because they

17

we«e completely outside the manpower pool, as Judge Kaufman sug­

18

gested was the rationale that could be applied to Oestereich,

19

but also with all kinds of rationales that might be applied to

20

the draft boards5 refusal or the draft boards8 decision to

21

accelerate„

22

j
i

Now it is the Government's contention that this is a — •

23

that Section 10(b)(3) is a proper exercise of national power,

24

that Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution gives Congress

25

the power to define and limit the jurisdiction of the inferior

23

1

courts of this country, and Article I, Section 8 gives the Con-

2

gress the power to raise and support the Armed Forces.

3
4
5

That is precisely what Congress is attempting to do
in Section 10(b) {3}.
There is a constitutional question raised by petitioner

6

as to the constitutionality of Section 10(b)(3).

7

position at the outset that this question has bsen decided by

8

this Court in Clark against Gabriel,- that it has been decided

9

against petitioner and the Court there specifically found that

10
11

It is our

there was no constitutional objection to Section 10(b)(3).
In Gestereich the Court stated its construction of

12

10(b)(3) left it unimpaired in the normal operations of the Act.

13

So I don't believe that the question of constitutionality can be

14

considered to be a serious one here.

15

The question of the distinction between this case and

16

Gestereich„ the question of whether there is any distinction that

17

can be made between exemptions and deferments.

18

no distinction, therefore Gestereich applies, I think, is very

19

much before this Court today.

20

And if there is

As I stated at the outset that all circuit courts which

21

have faced this question since Gestereich have decided the ques­

22

tion in the Government’s favor.

23

Eighth Circuits have decided the cases which are cited on page

24

23

The Second, Fourth, Sixth and

They have all decided that there is a distincti o;

24

In the. first place, the statutory distinction between

4

their exemption is unconditional.

5

power of the President to adopt rules and regulations by providir

8

for that exemption, but in the II-S deferment' in Section 6(h)(1)

7

there is a statutory condition placed upon it.

10

It isn’t given subject to the

The deferment is provided "under such rules and regula­

8
9

In Section 6(g) of the Selective j

tions as the President may provide."

Now that conditional ground

is not in S(g) involving the exemptions.
The Section 6(h)(1} specifically recognises the delin­

11
12

quency regulations in the last sentence of the same section.

13

the first time the delinquency regulations are recognised as

14

being in existence by Congress.

15

on page 26 of his opinion, that this was clear evidence that in

the ©ourfc that Congress did not suppose that reclassification

pursuant to the delinquency regulations would violate provisions'

18

of S (h) (1).

To say that Congress has not authorised the delinquency

existence.

And as Judge Friendly stated

Q

Just one more question to help me.

X

The petitioner

15

emphasised the change of the word to "shall" for the student.

16

He shall be put into a — da they put great emphasis on that?
X think that, Mr. Justice Marshall, referring to the

17

18

question of whether there is any discretion given to the Presi­

19

dent to defer students, in the 19S7 Act there was no discretion

20

given.

21

It was made mandatory.
The deferment was made mandatory, but the deferment

22

was not made unconditional.

23

such rules and regulations as the President may provide.

24
25

And the conditions were subject to

In Section 6 Cg5 there is no such condition given and.
I think this makes a significant distinction between a deferment
27

1

and an exemption.

I would also submit that there is a logical

2

correlation here between the whole gamut of the regulations and

3

the deferred status of the petition.
Now there are good reasons why all of these regulationsi

4
5

exist.

6

tion questionnaire, the carrying of draft cards, all or these

7

things were found to be significant in the United States against

8

O’Brien, when this Court found that the criminal statute against

9

the burning of a draft card, the statute itself stated a legiti­

io
si

The registration itself,, the filling in of a classifica­

mate Government purpose.
And I think there is a logical correlation between’ any­

12

body within the pool of manpower and all of these regulations.

13

I think that it may be admitted that single regulations may not

14

be indispensable, but if the Courts are going to try to get into

15

the business of saying which of the regulations are indispensablt

18

and which are not, when we are going to have again the Section

17

10(h)(3) frustrated, because all of these.questions are going to

18

come before the district courts below as to whether the draft

19

boards properly saw a particular regulation as having a logical

20

nexus with the status of an individual who was accelerated.

2!'

And I think that this piecemeal determination, by the

22

courts of what is and what is not indispensable are logically

23

connected would frustrate the purposes of Section 10(b)(3) and

24

serve no good purpose.

25

In the Oestereich decision great emphasis was placed op
28

1

the action of the draft board being blatantly lawless.

2

think that what the Court meant there and what Justice Douglas

3

meant in his decision was that there was no congressional authori

4

nation fox* the delinquency regulations to apply to a man once

5

he was exempt.

6

2ation,

7

was blatantly lawless.

3
9

And I

And that since there was no congressional authors

any effort to apply them to the individual who was exempt

And again in Gabriel where the Court said that the
action would have to flout, in Mr. Justice Douglas's concurring

10

opinion, where the action would have to flout the law by the

11

draft board shows the reluctance of the Court to broaden the rule

12

announced in Oastereich so that 10(b)(3) would apply as the cases

13

of deferments .

14
15

I think there are strong policy reasons for eliminating
Oestereich, as we have stated in our brief.

These are policy

reasons underlying 10 (b)(3) itself against litigious interruptions
15
17

of the Selective Service System.

13

very few people.

19

there are veterans, reservists, sole surviving sons and, as was

20

mentioned in the section involving Government officials, includ­

21

ing Federal judges and the legislative officers.

22

In the exempt category are a

There are ministers, there are people under 19

But in the deferred status there are a much greater

23

number of people.

In 6(h)(1) and (2), involving not only stu­

24

dents, but. also those deferred for dependency or hardship or

25

occupational problems — if all of these people were not subject
29

?

to the jurisdictional bar of 10(b)(3)i of bringing a preinduction

2

injunction, again 1 believe the 10(b)(3) itself would be so

3

emasculated, the purpose of the statute would ba so frustrated

4

that we would virtually rule it out of any effectiveness whatso­

5

ever .
And.I think that this Court would be better to declare

S
7

it unconstitutional rather than, to effectively frustrate- the

8

will of Congress by saying that 10(b)(3) would not apply not onlj

G

to those who are exempt, but also to those who were deferred.
I think that based on these arguments and based on the arguments

10

that the purpose of Congress in enacting Section 10(b)(3) is so

11

clear, to allow the process to continue, to allow the Selective

12

Service process with a minimum of interence to raise an army, to

13

go all the way up to the point where the man is about to be

14

inducted, and where he can raise all the objections that he has.

15

And at that point the process is essentially ever and

16

he can raise the objections to his induction at that point by

17

submitting to criminal prosecution or by agreeing to go into the

13

Army and submitting it on habeas corpus..

13

20

'

This is a sound con-

gressional purpose and that it should be in any way further

21

emasculated or diminished by extending its nonapplication to the

22

case of those who are deferred.

23
24

25

Q

Under your argument would this man have any relief

at all?

30

1

He would have relief by refusing to submit for induction and sub­

2

jecting himself, as Mr. Gutknecht did in the case that follows,

the constitutionality of the delinquency regulations as he seeks

to do here.

regulations, and they did so.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EMANUEL MARGOLIS, ESQ.

23

■ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

24

MR. MARGOLIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

25

Just very briefly on several of the points that were
31

1

stated by Mr,, Ruckelshaus, 1 am interested to learn that he eon

2

cedas that there are elements of punishment in what happened to
I the petitioner in this case.

That is an important confession anc

1 hope the Court will take thatinto consideration.

"V

It dove-

5 |tails with the argument that wa have made in our brief as well

i
6 |as the argument on the delinquency regulations, which we have
■

7 ;incorporated from the Gutknecht case.

j

3

I would like to point out that as far as the Gutknecht

9

case is concerned, it -is very different from this in one major
[

10

Irespect.

Gutknecht was not reclassified punitively, as was the

11

case here, and therefore it is a totally different factual situa­

12

tion.

13

Members of this Court will be given all the facts in that case

14

tomorrow.

But I don’t want to get into that, because the Honorable

As far as the statements by the Government that there

15
16

has been no effort to implement the Hershey directive, that there

17

is no evidence of this, this comes as a complete shock to peti­

18

tioner in light of the fact that the agreed statements on appeal

19

concede that the plaintiff’s complaint and lists all of the alle

20

gallons to that complaint which are crossed out or admitted in

21

terns of the posture of the case, alleges that this action was

22

taken pursuant to the terms of said directive.

23
24

The Court of Appeals below had no difficulty at all willh
i
that issue and stated in the course of Its opinion, and 1 quote |

25

from it;

■

"The majority stated that these actions
32

of the board

1

were in line with a memorandum and letter, dated, respectively,

z

October 24 and October 26, 1967«,”

3

that can be placed in issue at this time„

4

So i don't know really how

Furthermore, as far as the pursuit of these kinds of

5

processes or procedures of punitive reclassification pursuant

6

to the Hershey directive, I would call the Court’s attention to

7

a "yet unpublished series of hearings before the Senate Subcommit-}

8

tee on Administrative Practices and Procedures of the Committee

on the Judiciary, which Were held before — or rather on Novembei
