MR. STRAUSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Yesterday I believe I was asked at the close of the

session about remand — ought there to be a remand ought this

Court finally to pass on the statutory issue here.

I think that I should say that there would be a sub­

and all that is necessary is that the Court be convinced that

14

appellees probably will success upon their cuase of action in

16

There is no need to pass on

This is a preliminary injunction,

As I was starting to say, the State of New York in ,

13’

this most recently enacted statute, of which I believe the

18

Court has copies, has made soma policy judgments which I think

19

go to the heart of some of the doubts that ——

Excuse mas, Mr, Strauss.

You mean that if we were

to remand that we vacate the preliminary restraint.

No

2!

our view New York is, in any event, obligated to comply.

believe petitioners have made sufficient showing that Hew York

is out of compliance with that standard to justify such an

24

order.

We take the position that that relief is no more

It leaves free to New York the choice which this Court

said Haw York, must have in Rosado® that is, the choice of

withdrawing entirely from the Federal program*

Z

Then, the point 1 wanted to make on the basis' of

3

the statute is that New York has in fact made that choice.

4

the statute, the legislature said, and I am quoting at line 9

of the first page, if yon have it there,

necessary Federal requirements under the Social Security Act.

entirely clear, and as v;e set out in the rather long footnote
at the end of our amicus brief, is the judgment in which all
States of the Union have essentially concurred.
There was also the question yesterday, and I think thi s

23

21

goes back to what I was trying to say during the short time I

21

had then why it was the Government had put as part of its ques­

23

tion presented whether the New York State plan improperly favors

2%

residents of New York City over residents of other areas of

25

the State.

64

1

This goes, I think, to the heart of the issue. The

2

impropriety is not in itself in the payment of more money in

New York City than Naw York State.

state yesterday, in considering that residents of Mew York

if

State need services,, need goods, need items which are not under

d

any circumstances made available to residents of any other part

7

of the State even though their need for those items might equal,

be made the same.

But, as I was trying to

It seems to us that this is directly inconsistent wit!

18

the statute, with the provision of the statute which in both

cases Section 602(a) and Section 1382 (a.) provides that a State

on the basis of this record, that that need doesn't exist in

gested areas.
Q

13

I think Mew York City is the only city in the State

that has a subway system that people have to use.

Well I suppose it comas down to how particular

13

a judgment you were to make.

recognises, claims to recognise in its standard of need, doesn't

25

Mow, it is certainly our position that ’Jew York State

From the evidence in the record, it might also be lower

Q

Then your argument really comes .down to the fact

that there has been a mistake in judgment here, in legislative

No, it is more than that, Fir. Chief Justise.

are talking, at least I am talking here, not about the equal

I think the short answer to Mr. Strauss' argument
about albeit the District Court started off on the wrong foot,

?£;

why don't we simply take it the other way and affirm the injunc­
15

tion anyway because they are probably right about the statutory

14

ground as well.

15

statutory ground.

17

clear, because what the Court did. beiowwwas issue an injunction

se

against inforcement of the statute at all unless it were correct ed

IT

and what they thought were objective standards were imposed,

2C

which would have been a valid injunction under the equal protec­

21

tion clause, assigning a violation of that clause had been shown,

22

The short answer to that is that the sweeping

This Court's decision in Rosado makes that

The language is they are enjoined from enforcing the

21

statute at all other than according to objective, nondiscrimina -

24

fcory standards based upon the cost of the needs of such recipi­

Now, a statutory nonoonform!ty as in Rosado doesn’t

support any such injunction,

that clear. The most that could be done there would be a remand

4

to the District Court to, assuming that the probabilities were

5

that the HEW was right and we were wrong about the statutory

argument, the most that could be done would be to remand the

case to the District Court for a much more narrow injunction such,

as the one this Court discussed in Rosado,

10

That may be so but what precisely would be dif­

Again, to my knowledge, no.

As I have said, as

But there is a complete procedure or a procedure

O'

provided by Congress to achieve conformity by a State as a con­

dition to getting Federal grants, isn’t there?

10

A

Yes, indeed.

They can compel that.

20

When we look at the standard of need, we see that, in

1:1

fact. New York has one standard of need, and it is the same

throughout ’the State, just, as the Federal statute says it must

23

be.

In this whole discussion, I think,on both sides,

Therefore, what New

wholly irrelevant,, it seems to me, to whether or not Congress

We have talked about the question of whether New

It is ironic that this litigation cams

You think if they decide to make a uniform rate

is, that we would have to pass on the evidence on each one of
those to see whether or not they had reached a correct conclu­
sion on such difficult problems as to how much it would cost
to live in that county?
A

Mr. Justice Black, we have tried to indicate

throughout that we don't, think the equal protection clause reached

that far unless it were a case of something like racial discrimina­
tion or just complete patent arbitrariness where the State just
