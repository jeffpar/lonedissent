ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

MR. FLYM;

7

Mr. Chief Justice., and. may it. please the

8

Court;

I think we left off suggesting that if there were no

9

Bill of Rights at all, this Court would, nonetheless, be re­

10

quired by the Constitution as adopted by the framers, by the

11

State Ratifying Convention as they understood the constitution,

12

would require this Court, nonetheless, to protect individual

13

rights of citizens.

14

Q

'You say as they understood it?

15

A

Yes, Your Honor.

10

Q

Do you have a particular focus to put that on?

A

Yes, Your Honor? I do.

On pages 98 through 99

of our brief — X sm sorry, it's pages 100 through 101, we quote
from a statement made by the Rhode Island Ratifying Convention,
which is virtually identical — I think there are very minor
changes in language — almost identical to the statements made
by the North Carolina and Virginia Ratifying Conventions? and
the States, that is just a very small portion of the statement
made by the Ratifying Convention.
The Ratifying Convention said;
40

1

Q

Was made by whom?

2

A

By the Ratifying Convention of the State of

3
4

3

Rhode Island, four Honor., almost identical to the statement
made by the Ratifying Convention of the State of North Carolina,
as well as from the State of Virginia,.
These statements expressly asserted that Ratification

6

7

a
©

of the Constitution was based on an express understanding that
it did not infringe on the unalienable rights of the individual
citizens.
The fourth paragraph, the fourth proposition stated

10

in that ratifying statement, that: "Religion or the duty that
we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging if can be
directed only by reason and conviction arid not by force or
violence.

Therefore, all men have an equal, natural and in­

alienable right to a free exercise of religion according to the
dictates of conscience, and that no particular religious sect
or society ought to be favored or established by law in pre­
ference to others."
Q

What page is that on in your brief?

A

100 and 101, Your Honor.

The bottom of 100

20

through the top of 101.
21

That statement is virtually identical tc the statement
22

made in the Ratifying Convention of the State of New York,
23

quoted back at 'the end of the argument yesterday.
2^
Q

When did 'Rhode Island get around to ratifying

22

the Constitution? pretty late in the game, wasn't it?

£

A

That's right? Your Honor.

Q

When?

I8m not sure? but 1 think among the four

states represented in these statements, X!m perfectly sure that
j

6

there would have been no ratification of the constitution but

7

for the express understanding that these rights were safeguard©»

8

There was no need for a Bill of Rights to protect religion as

9

understood by the persons who drafted and who ratified the

10

constitution? and it’s true that a Bill of Rights was sub­

11

sequently enacted.

12

As Madison explained, and that's quoted at the bottom

13

of 98 through the top of 99s

14

great rights of a trial by jury, freedom of the press, liberty

of conscience, coming questioning that body, the invasion of

16

them is resisted by able advocates, yet their Magna Carta does

17

not contain any provision for the security of those rights?

18

respecting which the people of America are most alarmed„"

"Although I know whenever the

19

Q

Is that the only reference you have?

20

A

Oh, I have — 'these are just random

21

Q

I mean to this.

I don't see anything in here

22

that would necessarily lead to the conclusion that they thought

23

a man could get out of. going to the Army constitutionally, be­

24

cause of his religious beliefs.

25

A

That's a separate question, Your Honor,

42

That

!

certainly is related and that’s why I mentioned it at this

Z

point.
I’m simply addressing myself now to the assertion

a

4

made by the government that religion does not mean conscience?

5

and I think that’s clearly wrong from the standpoint of his­

6

tory.

?

I can’t understand the government’s inclincation so to

construe the protection of- religion in the Bill of Rights.

8

understand why they would like to limit it, but it’s flatly

9

inaccurate as a matter of history; that’s just not what they

10

understood 180 years ago.
What we’re calling for is not something which we’re

11

22
13
14
15

28
17
18

destroying orderly government at all.

2!

22
23
24

25

Obviously, what would

be most destructive of orderly government would be if the
constitution were ignored; and we want the constitution en­
forced.

And the constitution says certain things about what
j

powers Congress had and I will come very quickly to that centra .
question:

What powers did Congress receive through the con-

stitution to draft individuals, whether in peace or in war?
That’s the central issue? obviously the constitution

19

20

I

did not delegate this power to Congress? Congress doesn't have
it.

Even if Congress would like to have it, even if Congress

thinks that it is absolutely indispensible in its judgment to
have that, if that power was not conferred by the constitution,
it’s perfectly plain they don’t have the power.
The constitution sets the limits of the power that
43

i
2

was in fact, conferred to Congress»
Q

Is it your idea that anything, any time a man

3

believes it * s wrong to go to war, if he couldn’t be conscripted,

4

that would almost, necessarily, do away with conscription?

5

wouldn’t it?

6

A

That is not our proposition, Your Honor,

I

7

think there is a very important distinction between a man who

3

acts on the basiis of conscience, that is, ha simply can't obey

3

the order; that's our man, Sisson, and a man who thinks, well,

10
11

12
13

V.,

it would be a bad policy to go fight a war in Vietnam -Q

It would be pretty hard to distinguish between - the

two, wouldn’t it when you begin to probe their minds?
A

Yes, Your Honor? but that's a very customary
.. .

v-

14

function in law, that is we’re constantly — the courts — are

IS

constantly about the business of establishing whether a man

16

intended to do something or other.

1?

avoid that,

13

Q

It's just awfully hard to

Well, Counsel, this familiar history is very

19

interesting, but could you bring it down to the particular case,

20

if I may put to you again, the question I suggested yesterday;

21

would his rights of conscience be violated if, in fact, he were

22

taken and assigned as a security guard at the American Embassy

23

in Paris for the entire tour of his duties; would his rights of

24

conscience be invaded?

25

A

I think so, Your Honor,
44

That is —

Q

1

z

I thought his objection was to the particular

war being conducted in Vietnam»

3

A

Well, in a sense that’s true, but —

4

Q

Well, is it all military service or just the

3

War in Vietnam?
A

6

Well, it5s to military service? that is, ha

7

disobeyed an order»

He disobeyed that order on the basis of

8

his conviction that the order was invalid.

3

really don't think that the question is whether his subjective

At this point 1

10

belief was well”founded.

11

from an objective point of view he was right, whether the order

12

was valid.

13

order tothis man to report for induction? because if Congress

14

had no such power, simply to induct him into the Army, then the

IS

refusal to obey the order simply is not a criminal act.

IS

that is independent about what he may have believed about the

17

Vietnam War or not have believed.

Did Congress, in fact, have the power to issue the

Q

13

The threshold question is whether

I have difficulty reconciling the points

as you state them now and his own. declarations which, if 1

20

understood this record, were all aimed at military action in l

2?

Vietnam.

22
23
24
23

Wow, did 1 roisread the record?
A

I think so, Your Honor»

I respectfully

suggest that from the outset, the motion that was filed, the
pretrial motion that was filed in this case, squarely raised,
and the government has so recognised, squarely raised that the
45

1

initial question rftised by the Appellee was simply the power

2

of the Congress to issue that order tohim.

3

Congress does not have that power."

4

nothing about, his beliefs.
Q

3

He said, "No,

That is, if he had said

Well, I’m making a distinction about what he

6

said and what you are saying and I can, at least, see a dif­

7

ference .
A

8
9

Well, I -think. Your Honor, that if I under­

stand Your Honor’s question, that bears on the issues which

10

were properly raised.

n

which the District Judge, in fact, based his decision on.

12

is:

13

under the First Amendment.

14

One Issue very definitely is the issue
That

"The right of Johnny Sisson to exercise freely his religion

Or, alternatively, the question, the issue whether

15

the Selective Service Act of .1967 constitutes an establishment

IS

of religion.

17

Repeatedly we asserted, and we asserted again in a motion in

18

arrest of judgment.

19

But, those were just two of the issues raised.

The threshold question obviously has to be whether the

20

order issued to Johnny Sisson was invalid.

It might have been

2!

invalid for a number of technical reasons.

22

cal reasons, technical deficiencies in the order, did not appeal:

And the point we repeatedly stress is that Congress

reasons, but what reason in your sxibmission,- what particular

reason are you submitting now, that’s what j. 9m not very clear

The particular reason, Youx Honor,, is that

Congress’s power to raiss and support armies, which is the

clause upon which the government relies squarely

extend — it is not an unlimited power,

13
u

Q

Well, all right.

does not

And it's limited in what

respect, vis-a-vis this case?
A

It is limited, first of all, to circumstances
1 know that is somewhat vague, but

15

when an emergency exists.

IS

I think that by lookingat the historical interpretation of

17

Congress’s power we can deriva a very definite meaning as to

18

what the framers of the constitution understood; what the

19

Members of the first Congress understood by "the power to raise

20

and support armies.”

21

Q

Well, now, you’re saying — I know in your

22

brief you say avariety of things, but now are you directing

23

yourself to th® argument that Congress has no constitutional

24

power to enact a Selective Service Act when there is no declared

23

war, or are you saying it has no power to conscript people into
47

I

the military \\shen there is the situation goinq on that is going

2

on in Southeast. Asia,, which violates international law.

3

point are you arguing now"
A

4

What

that' is what I don’t quite get.

I think the most solid point we have is the

S

fact that Congress has no power to grant in'an emergency, which

6

usually will mean the same thing as no power to grant, absent

7
8

80

1?
12

13

a declaration of war.

of emergencies, even if there were no declaration of war,

16

country.

21

22

Well, then you are saying that there is no

power, constitutional power to conscript when there is no
imminent danger of invasion of this country?

18

20

This country must have the power to survive.
Q

17

19

have the power to conscript, because I just

don't believe that Congress is powerless to defend this

14

15

The reason we do not assert that inthat j

form, that is that Congress can't conscript unless there has
'
been a declaration of war is that we concade that in a number

Congress would

A

X'ra not saying that, either, Your Honor.

Q

I don't understand your argument.

I gather

the argument you are making now has nothing to do with Sisson,
as such?
A
Q

That's right.
This could be John Smith, who is a religious

or irreligious person who has no particular ideas about Vietnam
23
You are talking about general Congressional power.
24
A

{

Yes.

25

48

One example of an emergency, Your Honor, would be

i
2

the civil war.

That is, civil war is not a declared war? it

3

is an insurrection and indeed, Congress did adopt the Con­

4

scription Act and we’re not challenging the power of Congress—

5

Q

Well, what are you challenging?

6

A

We're saying that this war in the presence

1

circumstances, just doesn't amount to the kind of emergency

3

that must have bean contemplated by the draftsmen of the con­

3

stitution.
Q

SO

You mean because they do not have a right to

It

conscript in the time of peace; is that the argument you are

12

making?
A

13
!4

15
16

17
13
19

Yes, Your Honor.

The time of peace, again, is
|

somewhat misleading, because that may be thought to mean the
absence of a declaration of war.

I think what is at issue is

the existence of an emergency that makes it very, very clear
that Congress has no choice? it must conscript, because if it
doesn't conscript our national security is, in a very immediate
sense, at «take.
I dostft think there is much ambiguity about what the

20
■

21

power of Congress has meant for the first 150 years of the
existence of this country.

Peacetime conscription, as we know, !

22

23
24

25

is very, very recent.
Q

Do you deny the power — you say the Congress

has no constitutional power to conscript from, like universal

2

A

Gh, definitely not.

Q

Definitely yes or no?

Mr. Flym, can you help me with my problem of

A

I'll try, Your Honor.

There are several steps

to our argument,.

The first argument is whether Congress has the power

all.
There would remain a subsequent, different question,

Q

politics,

11

Q

I am sure you will agree that that argument

can be made by anybody other than Sisson.

It don’t have to be

Sisson.
A

It is a difficult problem.

The judicial system

is full of very, very difficult problems.
Probably no more important questions arise than when &n
individual's rights are pitted against the government8s power.
Q

I agree.

It's a difficult problem to tell me

how being on duty at the Embassy in Paris is aiding the Vietnam
I have great difficulty with that.

That is not the question at this point, Your

The question is that he doesn't want to serve

anyplace in the military?
A

He might want to and nonetheless his refusal

Your Honor, it got in this case because we

raised it and we stressed it at every point.

This is not a new

point on appeal at all.
Q

Well, so far you haven't come to the issues

discussed by the Solicitor General.

You are, so far, making a

much broader argument, as I understand it.

You haven't come to

Mr. Sisson yet.
A
Q

Yes.
You are telling us that Congress has no con-

stitutional power to compel military service, at least in the
52

1

absence, of a declared war or a "national emergency*" whatever

2

that might bej and you say that there is not now a national

3

emergency; is that right»

4
S

You haven't come to Mr» Sisson and his conscience or
lack of it; is that correct?

6

A

.That's correct, Your Honor.

1

Q

Do you feel that we should sustain the judgment

below on other grounds?

9

A

I think this Court is charged —

10

Q

Well* that's accurately what you are doing?

ii

A

Yes* it is.

12

13

That is, there are a number of

grounds which we assert.
But, I would simply, as a last comment to Mr. Justice

14

He had no question that if there were no Bill of
Rights, man's right of conscience would nonetheless be protected.
You didn't need a Bill of Rights.

As a matter of fact, pre­

cisely the argument which ..the government now makes was the
argument here that if you provided a Bill of Rights then some­
body would say, "Well, that's all you have," but they —

What power does

support armies, independently of the First Amendment,
Our second argument is whether that power is, in some
specific way, limited by the First Amendment.

I am now

addressing myself solely to the first question.
Forgetting about the Bill of Rights altogether, what
power did the constitution confer upon Congress to raise and
support armies?

I .do suggest, respectfully that the history of

the ratification of the constitution, the debates at the constitutional convention, simply do not lend themselves to any
interpretation that would suggest that bad then it was thought
that the Federal Government, Congress, could simply reach out
and pluck people up for universal military service,
Q

Do you say we must read Article I as meaning
54

that the Congress has the power to raise and support armies in

2

time of war and they were limited to that?

3

And time of national emergency, Your Honor,

4

Q

In time of national emergency.

And who’s

going to define the national emergency?

That is a perfect example to

that’s the way in which the standing array has been raised for
150 years.

And it was never suggested that Congress could

simply say, "Well, we don’t think we ought to be spending money
in this way.

We aren't going to do it.

furthermore we think it5s democratic.

We’ll save money, and
We don’t want the

mercenary army."
Maybe Congress does think that there are valid
reasons for conscripting men instead of simply having volunteers
to man tills standing army in peacetime, ..but that, doesn't change
the power that was delegated to Congress at the time the con­
stitution was adopted.

Q

Well, might that have been the reason they put

into the constitution"the power of Congress to raise armies?"
A

Well, I think,

Your Honor, the historical

record is clear that the "power to raise and support armies,"
is included because a standing army, as feared as it was, and it|

22
23
24
25

was very, very much feared, because the fear was that Congress
would use this standing army to eliminate the powers of states
and to oppress individual citizens in the states.
61
\

1

Q

They favored a militia?

a

A

Oh? absolutely.

There are at least five

3

separate references to militia.

That is, you have at least

4

three clauses in Article 1 which deal expressly with militia.

3

And, again, militia were to be called in specified circumstances

6

only while the emergency lasted.
In the Second Amendment, for instance, the Second

7

8

Amendment provides that individual citisens have the right to

9

keep and bear arms because you need a strong militia so that the

10

state can defend itself.
The argument that a standing army was all right was

11

la

based repeatedly on the argument that Congress could never

13

amass a standing array of such power fchatit could overcome the

14

powers of states, because they had the militia and the militia

15

were very, very numerous,

As I recall it, and my memory may be entirely

wrong, those who insisted on having nothing but a militia, state

militia were defeated at the Constitutional Convention and ii.

was provided that the Congress could raise armies.
A

20

That's absolutely correct. Your Honor.

But,

21

it's important to bear in mind that the concept of a standing

22

army was agreed to in a very, very limited way.

23

cisely the opposition which Your Honor* noted, that people said,

24

"Well, you don’t need a standing army? we’ve got. our state

25

militia."

That is, pre­

The argument was, "Well, are you going to take
62

farmers and post them on garrison posts on the frontiers to

2
combat the Indians?

We need an army, a standing army,"

But,

3
ivhat did that mean?

The very first Congress enacted a bill.

As a. matter

16
17

A

I would like to mention another separate argument that.
I simply mentioned in passing.

That is that if an all volunteer

army is feasible. Congress just can't pick and choose ways of
raising men and say, "Well, we're not going to spent the money,
so that we will have this money available for the projects.
"' ■
That is, if they can raise volunteers* they are required to
raise volunteers for this standing army; that was the original
concept,

63

The word "raise armies," is used repeatedly by the

i

2

First Congress, by the early Congresses and they specified that

3

they mean volunteers and they deal with militia entirely

4

separately.

5

the size of

As a matter of fact, in one case they increased
the authorised army, I think, to 5,000 men.

3.

tod they said, "We want to make it clear that as soon as this

7

emergency is over the army is- to be disbanded; we don't want

8

it around; we want that number reduced to 1,500."
Now, I won’t even touch on the argument that the

9
10

power of Congress is further limited so that it can't raise an

11

army for an illegal war.

12

think it's much too complex to even begin at this point.
I would, if I may, like to turn for the remaining

13
14
IS

time to the Solicitor's argument with respect to establishments
issue, as well as the free exercise issue.

Incidentally, Mr. Justice Marshall, I checked with the

16

20
21

various authorities on the question bearing on whether we have
an arrest of judgment decision.

If you concede that it is being

completely uncontrollable, then it might make sense to apply
a much more restricted notion of what is meant by religious
in the First Amendment insofar as it related to the power of
Congress to raise and support armies.

But, I just don't think

there is any support; any historical support for the view that
Congress in 1789 could simply reach out and say, "I’m going to
take you.

I know it's peacetime; I know we don't have any wars,

but we've got to have a strong army,"

Thera is just absolutely

no support for that view.

vitiate an appeal under that provision like it does in the

arrested judgment?

6

A

Mr» Justice, rightly or wrongly, we don't get

to that because we construe that in the light of the legislative;

history as also involving the question of whether the defendant

has bean put in jeopardy, and if the defendant has been put in \

before the empaneling of the jury, for example if the Court

position would be — that there would be carved out a final

decision of a District Judge holding an Act of Congress un­
constitutional, which is unreviewable by anyone,

A

9

Mr. Chief Justice, that was what the law un­

10

doubtedly was in all respects until 1909 and all that we can saj

11

is that Congress in its great care with respect to double

12

jeopardy simply has not yet made available an appeal in that

case.

I suppose, Mr. Solicitor General, however, if

this Court in some other case, some related case, in some other
case, should express its views and if those views were incon­

We certainly have enough jurisdiction to de­

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, the Court has decided that

it has jurisdiction —
Q

Now, the next question Xsm putting to you is

assuming that much jurisdiction, at least, and assuming on the
underlying question that the conclusion is that there is no
direct review up here.

Does that limited jurisdiction that we

have, give us the power under- 2106 to send the case back to the
District Court which gives us general power to make —
A

Mr,, Justice I would think that if you concludet

that you had no jurisdiction the case has never left the
District Court and you would not have power to send it back

Thank you, Mr. Flym, and the

case is submitted.
