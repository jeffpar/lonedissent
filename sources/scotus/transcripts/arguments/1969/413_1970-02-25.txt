Mr. Chasanow, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ABRAHAM CHASANOW, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

6

MR. CHASANOW:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8

the Court:

The Petitioners in this case contend that the

9

evidence is constitutionally insufficient to support the judg­

10

ment, and as a basis for that contention they refer to three

11

of the 45 exhibits which were introduced by the Respondent

12

which the trial court instructed the jury to consider and which

13

they did, in fact, consider.

14

How, some of those exhibits are contained in the

15

printed record; other are not as important as the major ex­

16

hibits are in the transcript.

17

But the Court of Appeals specifically made men-'

18

tionof the fact that in addition to the publications that Mr.

19

Bresler has committed blackmail, there were publications that

20

he had engaged in an unethical trade, had been guilty of skul­

21

duggery, had had numerous proceedings filed against him for

22

failure to make construction corrections in accordance with

23

county standards.

24
25

These allegations are injurious to Mr. Bresler and
his business as a contractor, and
18

were libelous per sa.

1

The court had also previously referred in its opinion to

2

another article which was published prior to three foregoing

3

articles on April 22, 1955, before the blackmail articles and

4

before Mr. BresXer became a candidate for Comptroller.

5

that was headlined: "City Battles Bresler onTwo Fronts."

6

was a subcaption: "Court Suit."

It was written by Petitioner

Skolnik and it falsely alleged that the City and Bresler would
also be at odds this week on the suit filed by the City against
Ivy Homes, Inc., and Bachelor Village, Inc. comes before the
Circuit Court.
Q

Do you think it’s fair to characterize the
of the Court of Appeals' opinion as resting on

12
13

And

the principal* charge — the blackmail charge?
A

No, Your Honor —

Q

There are references all the way through it to

some of these other matters, but as I read the opinion the
essence of it wasthe blackmail charge.
A

We did not dispute the fact that this was the

principal charge, but I would like to point out that in the
second blackmail article, for example, there was the word,
"skulduggery," and when Mr. Skolnik was asked on the stand about
the word "skulduggery," he said, "This is the word that the
reporter used inthe article."

When the reporter testified for

the Petitioners, she said, "I did not use that word."
inserted and, as frequently happens.
19

That was

Now, this was a change and this was what the Court

1

2

of Appeals also said was intended to impute dishonesty on the

3

part of Bresier.

/

Q

What did the Trial Court refer to in instruc­

tions to the jury?
A

The Trial Court specifically said that the jury

7

should consider all of the articles in evidence and also in­

8

structed the jury that it

9

Nov/, I emphasize that because one of the principal arguments is

to consider the entire context.

10

that the word "blackmail" is taken out of context and didn't

11

mean what it said.

12

But first, they had taken it out of context by

13

publishing it as a caption in the first paragraph.

14

the reporters both said that they had not published all of

15

their notes concerning the meeting, but that they had used the

16

word "b1ackmai1."

17

Secondly,

The second reporter, the reporter for the second

18

article said, "I selected out the word ’blackmail' to show it

19

was Mr. Sterling's word."

20

notes and then I asked her why she left it out and she said

21

"well, it had been used the week before and I thought it was

22
23
24

25

But she said she didn't use all her

proper to use it again in the article."
The Court of Appeals makes one other important point
and that is that these —
Q

Yes, but did the Trial Court refer specifically
20

I

to some documents?
A

Oh, yes; the second blackmail article, exhibit

4

Q

5

A

What else?
It referred to the blackmail article —- well,

6

actually the court said it was not going to comment specifi­

7

cally on the facts, but just briefly say what the, what some of

8

the witnesses said»

9

themselves„

10

Q

But, it didn’t go into detail on the facts

In its instructions to the jury as far as any

11

particular document was concerned, it only referred to the

12

blackmail articles?
A

IS
14

No, sir; as a matter of fact, I don’t recall

that there was specific ™

15

Q

16

A

Well, that’s all right.
The Court of Appeals made one other point,

17

which is important to this issue; that to distinguish it from

18

other articles which are published by a newspaper in which

19

intemperate statements are made, it said that this was not a

20

disinterested or impartial publishing ofa report of what was

21

said at a public meeting, and it pointed out that the people

22

who had made the statements, there was a relationship between

23
24
25

them.
The court said specifically, and I quote;

"The close

connection between the Skolniks, Mrs. Bergemann, Mrs. Rosetti
21

1

and Mr. Herling, those to whom the word ’blackmail’ is

2

attributed, Mrs. Sucher and Mrs, Williamson, who wrote the

3

articles and Charles Swan, the President of GHI, and the

4

principal opponent of Bresler on the high school and zoning

5

issue.

6

Now, I think it might be well at this time —

7

Q

Excuse me, Mr. Chasanow.

8

A

Yes.

9

Q

Do I understand that the Respondent concedes

May I ask a question?

10

that he had the burden of satisfying the Uew York Times test

II

to get a recovery?

IE
13
14
15
16

A

We did concede that, Your Honor.

I mean, for

purposes of that and the Court of Appeals in arguendo.
Q

Yes, but I am asking if the Respondent does

concede the judgment stands only if he satisfied the Times test?
A

May I make an exception tothat, Your Honor?

17

I think that this question of public officials has never been

18

clearly defined.

19

respect: that their only constitutional defense was that

20

Bresler was a public official.

21

time of the first two series of articles, Bresler was a Member

22

of the House of Delegates in Montgomery County, a different

23

county; not Prince Georges County.

24
25

It is an important issue in this case in this

The evidence shows that at the

There is no mention in any of the 45 exhibits that
Bresler was a Member of the House of Delegates and none of these
22

1

articles pertained in any way to his official conduct which is

2

emphasized in New York Times versus Sullivan.
Q

What difference wouldthat make, Mr. Chasanow?

Sullivan rule?

he is a public* official, must they identify him each time

A

7

No, sir.

I say this, because normally refer™

8

ence is made to official conduct which has to identify the

9

official.

This case has nothing to do with official conduct

10

and they didn’t even think that there was any privilege attache:!

11

to the fact that he was a public official, because they didn't

12

mention it.

13

Even the article where they published the fact that

14

it was going to be announced that he was to run for State

15

Comptroller that the Governor, Vice President Agnew has asked

16

him about it.

17

he was a Member of the House of Delegates.

20

be a. Member of the House of Delegates.

21

Q

Even that article didn't mention the fact that
It had nothing to

We say that they are using this just as a

Well, on reading what I must confess are rather

22

confusing instructions of the trial judge, particularly on two

23

occasions, as I read it, the jury was called back and given

24

rather explicit instructions, as I understand it, quoting

25

verbatim, not only from Sullivan, but also from Garrison and

23

1

from Rosenblatt„

2

A

Yes, sir? yes, sir.

$

Q

And that's why I asked you — this case cer­

4
5

tainly was tried? wasn't it* on. the premise that the Respondent
recovered only if he satisfied the Times malice test?

8

A

Yes, sir; that was the specific instruction —

7

Q

And are we then to regard the issues that you

8

have described as on the premise that this is a case within the

9

Times-SulXivan requirements?

10

A

Yes; if Your Honor will draw the distinction,

11

Mr. Justice, between the Sullivan case and I'd like to point

12

out that in my brief I have indicated there are .limitless

IS

exceptions.

18

hostile and prejudiced community in which they could hardly hope

for a fair trial.

into Greenbelt.

perspective I'd like to mention one thing that the Court of

Appeals noted:

12

that they might have made a mistake and somebody else was

13

making the profits that they might have made and, incidentally,

14

This was the burning question.

And this is
And this is the conflict.

These were amateur plan­

I think that in order to recognize the posture of
this case, let me jump to the articles which start with the
announcement that Mr. Bresler was going to run for Comptroller.
I have not realized —
Q

In order to escape the impact

the New York

Times, don’t you have to show that Mr. Bresler was neither a
public official nor a public figure?

The latter by virtue of

the majority in Butts and Walker.
A

Well, this — well, let me say this; we have
26

felt that actually Butts was the dominating case, because we

2

felt that he was. not really a public official, at least as had

3

been previously defined in other case's by this Court.

4

wouldn’t come within the categories of St. Amanfc or a Commis­

sioner as in the Hew York Times, or Deputy Sheriff, or any othe:

8

of the categories.

we’re not saying how far we’re going to go and we certainly

8

won11 go all the way down the line —

And this Court has specifically said --

9

Q

Well, what about General Walker infche —

10

A

As a public figure?

u

Q

Yes.

12

A

Well, General Walker was anationally-known

13

figure.

No question of this.

The Court of Appeals again com­

14

mented that they would not have found Bresler to be a public

15

figure.

16

Now, I’d like to make this clear —

17

Q

What was that?

m

A

The Court of Appeals saidthat

they would not

is

have found Bresler to be either a public official or a public

20

figure, but they said, arguendo, since the trial court had

’

21

instructed the jury on the basis of both public official and

2,2

public figure that the question was really academic.

23

But —

24

Q

25

Well, are you arguing here that even if these

instructions don’t pass muster in the New York Times? even
27

1

if the evidence is insufficient to prove malice under New York

2

Times, nevertheless they would be home free on a non-New York

3

Times basis, because this isn't a New York Times Ccise?

4

your position?

A

Is that

I think that would ba one aspect in view of

the fact that there are -—
Q

Well, if it’s not a New York Times case,

8

actually that principle doesn't apply, is there anything that

9

this Court has ever said of what the Federal Constitution does

10

n
\z

about the State's libel action?
If he's not either a public official or a public
figure, why is the case here at all?

A

15

Q

Well, that's a. question I asked, and I can only

Well, are you asserting here that you don't

17

was either a public figure or a public official?

24
25

A

He was a public figure in G eenbelt, because the

newspaper made him one,
Q

Well, do you concede that the New York Times

rules apply to him?
A

I don't think it would apply to this entire

case, Mr. Justice, for this reason -Q

Well, it's only one case, one figure.

A

Yes, sir.

But, I'm saying that there are some
28

•j

of these libels which had no application whatsoever as to his

2

activities as a public figure.

3

that there had been suits filed against him for violation of

4

county building standards.

5

this had nothing to do with the public issue which they were

6

emphasizing: land and zoning.

This was a private enterprise --

Well, then you say that the New York Times has

13

no relevance to this case; has no applicability to this case.

Q

And in what respect was he a public figure?

A

The fact that they had made him one, as one who

was participating — well, I'd have to go back to 1934 ■—-

30

1

Q

Well, I would suppose that some of these alle­

2

gations certainly related to whatever it was that made him a

3

public figure, namely his activities in the construction busi­

4

ness and his relationships with the County Board,

5

made him a public figure.

6

the conduct of his business with the county?

7

A

No, sir,

That's what

Didn't these allegations; relate to

1 think I should point out more

8

clearly what made him a public figure.

In 1964 on May the 7th

9

when there was some dispute, some discussion of Council, the

10

News Review published a report that the Council and the audience

n

decided it made much more sense to stop attacking each other

12

and concentrate on a common targets

13

and that was when they decided that they had to have a scape­

14

goat. because Bresler only owned a minority interest in these

15

properties; he was not the major owner.

16

owned more of an interest than he, but they had to have a

17

name and his was the name that was selected.

18

Bresler, whowasn't there,

There were others who

This was followed up by the group sponsored by

19

Greenbelt Homes,

20

announced on April 8, 1965 that the "Save Greenbelt Group,”

21

gets its officers a name, CFPG and they formed this organisation

22

with Mr. Swan, with Mayor Smith, with Albert Herling, who made

23

one of the blackmail accusations, with Mrs. Skolnik, and then

24

on April 22nd they announced not only a citizen — a citywide

25

Mr,Swan, who was President, in which they

membership drive, but had an article, ’’City Battles Bresler on
31

1

Two Fronts."

2

was when they made the false allegation with the subtitle:

3

"Court Suit," that the city and Breslex- would be at odds.

4

He was singled out by the News Review.

And that

Now, Bresler was not a defendant in that case, and

5

they knew it.

Even later, on May 6th after there had been a

6

hearing and after the court had issued an order against Ivy

7

Homes, Inc., in which Breslex* had no interest whatsoever, this

a

is what the News Review said: "At a hearing two weeks ago a

9

court order was issued to the builders of Boxwood, another

10

Bresler development."

development to which the court ordered, but they wanted to

12

feature his name.

13

featured his name.

Bresler had nothing to do with that

The exhibits show that they constantly

Thisis like the man who pleaded for leniency on the

14
15

ground sthat he was an orphan after he had shot his parents.

16

They had made him a public figure and they were using this.

17

They were usingthe public official defense, even though they

18

knew there was no relation and it was nevementioned in the

19

articles.

20

But, getting to the time when they announced: "Charles

21

Bresler to Run for State Comptroller," on June 9, 1966 and this

22

is where we get into the questionof malice,

23

that this lawsuit that was filed against Mr. Bresler was sub­

24

sequent? it had nothing to do ifith it. But, taking the —

28

Q

Nov/, they claim

Is this the charge to which you refer to •—
32

i

1
2

A

No; this was after the blackmail charge.

But,

after the blackmail charge there were other defamations.

3

Q

Well, which one do you consider was the worst?

4

A

We consider that the blackmail, skulduggery,

5

false reports of lawsuits for violations of building standards,

0

damaged him as a builder.

7

There were other articles about possible corrupt influence on

8

the school board, in which his name was mentioned in connection

9

with the suit against the school board.

10

He was not a party to

the case, but they featured his name.

11
12

Those are probably the most serious.

It?s hard to say which straw broke the camel's back.
We felt there was an accumulation, but certainly —

13

Q

You are sure the accumulation broke his back?

14

A

It certainly made him the most hated man in

And we think that the cumulative effect of these articles, even

17

those which were not necessarily libelous per se, which were

18

intended to, and did, in fact, damage him.

19

I don't think there would be any dispute? about that.

But, to start toindicate the process, they announced

20

he was going to run for State ComptroXleron June 9th and that's

21

when they had the article which..had several false statements.

22

And, incidentally, in thatarticle he vras identified as a

23

builder.

24

Q

As a what?

25

A

As a builder.
33

1

He was not mentioned as a Member of the House of

2

Delegates, but as a developer and builder.

currently faced with a series of legal actions instituted by

4

the City of Greenbelt and referred to this suit whichhad been

5

dismissed almost a year before, and also the false report that

a number of homeowners in the Lakecrest and Boxwood developments

7

started legal proceedings against him.

Well, if they had said in the article: "Builder

and prominent political figure,"or "builder and political
leader," then you —

Incidentially it did —

You seem to be making a point of their omission

of his political affiliations.

15

16

would that make it all right?

18

A

If they said, "Builder and

It would not be the governing factor, but I

think it would, at least if they were saying, "We had the right

19

to criticise a candidate for office, there certainly might be

20

some reference to the fact that he does hold a political office.

21

22
23

25

If there is a question that he was qualified for that
office and if there should be some question about it, but we
don’t contend, this is a major premise.
We really want to point out that this was damaging,' as
we allege, to his reputation as a builder, his violation of

Suppose the Governor, for example,, coming to

Do you think that's libelous, per se?

A

10

No, sir? I think there is a difference, though.

11

There had been articles published about the time.

There still

12

are; there was one in this morning, about bribery — relating to

13

bribery on zoning in Prince Georges — this has been a burning

14

issue in Prince Georges County and Virginia.

15

Greenbelt were very aware of this.

The people in

Now, to them, the fact that somebody was threatening

16
17

to prevent the building of a school, I would think would be

13

much more serious than just bribing some official with a couple

19

hundred dollars.
The jury obviously felt that they intended to accuse

20
21

him of blackmail.

As a matter of fact, Mrs. Skolnik, when asked

12

A

Your discussion with the jurors is not before

I'm sorry, sir.

But, I think that they tried

13

to be temperate; I think it indicated that they did rfccach what

14

they felt was a verdict fair to both sides.

13
16
17

We think that this whole pattern and I'm sorry that
the exhibits are not in chronological order, indicated that they
ware leading up to — as a matter o€ fact, the filing of the

18

suit against Mr. Bresler, which was an absolutely privileged

19

action, was filed shortly after the announcement of his candi­

20

dacy and we felt that this whole pattern of announcements week

21

after week, were the culmination of the suit and the misrepresen­

22

tation as to the purpose of collecting the money for the suit

23

is an indication that they had intended to damage him all the

24

way through; that this was a continuing action.

25

We think that, obviously the jury was convinced that

37

?

they intended to accuse him of blackmail and that this is what

2

a layman, reading the article would have felt, particularly

3

when there was no reason to publish the caption; "Blackmail,"

4

unless they wanted to invite attention to the fact that he had

5

been accused of blackmail? that he was a criminal.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ROGER A. CLARK, ESQ.

10

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

Thank you, Mr. Chasanow.

11

MR. CLARK;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

I would justlike to comment briefly on Justice

13

White's question about the instructions.

I think it's very

14

clear from the instructions, Mr. Justice White, that the trial

15

court singled out only the blackmail article.

16

it three times in his instructions and did not refer to any of

17

the other articles, which the only other article —•

He xeferred to

18

19

A

Except generally.

20

Q

He told the jury to consider all 45 exhibits.

21

A

That's correct, but he —

22

Q

-— and so we have no idea what the jury thought

23
24
25

Except generally.
The only other article he —

was -A

Well, I think that from reading the instructions

though, Your Honor, you will see that the focus of the case, and
38

1

certainly the focus of the Court of Appeals“ opinion is on the

2

term "blackmail.,"

3

joint extract; you get that clearly from reading the opinion of

4

the Court of Appeals.

5

Q

And you get that clearly from reading the

So far as those two courts went, but it was the

6

jury that decided the factual issues and awarded the damages

7

and there is no way on earth to know what they might have felt

8

was crucial.

9

A

That's right, Your Honor, excapt that there are

10

only -- there is only one other article in issue, about which

n

there was evidence that it was factually inaccurate, and that's

12

, the one about the homeowners' proceedings, wiieh is just really

13

a piddling inaccuracy when you take it against the facts that

14

they knew and the way they reported it.

15

This reference in the instructions to the blackmail,

16

I think is helpful in answering the point that you made, Mr.

17

Justice, about the explicit references to the New York Times at

18

the end of this -- at the end of the court’s instructions.

19

The court instructed the jury that, going to the factor

20

of truth there is no contention in this case it is conceded by

21

the defendants that these allegations were not true; that

22

Bresler committed the crime of blackmail, and that Bresler was

23

guilty of blackmail.

24
25

So, in the background of that reference when the court
after it instructed the jury with malice, ill-will, spite or
39

1

2

hostility —

Q

Welly now on that, the jury,, as I read this

3

record, came back twice.

4

is that right?

5

6

7

A

Essentially right? the judge instructed after

the lunch break.
Q

On the second occasion the judge —

The jury hadn't been out.
I see.

But when they came back, while he

8

didn't say in so many words? "Forget everything I said to you

9

about spite, ill-will and so forth, the law of the case is the

10

New York Times rule"and as I read it, what he did was read them

11

the actual language out of the opinions in Times, Garrison and

12

Rosenblatt.

13

A

That's right,

14

Q

Then did the jury then have the case on the

IS
16

basis of "Forget everything I said to you on spite, ill-will?
A

If he had said that, I think that would have

17

cured substantially much of the error that had taken place, but

18

he didn't simply give the New York Times instructions.

1©

why I get back to this bit about "we conceded that the allega­

20

tions of blackmail were false," because when he gets into the

21

New York Times instruction at the end he prefaces his comment

22

with: "There is no contention here that the statements regarding

23

blackmail were true."

24

that we have conceded the statements were false.

Q

Oh, no? no,

A

Well, the fact that we did not contend that

the articles were true meant that we conceded —- that's what

6

the instructions were —- that we conceded that the allegations

7

were false.

8

Wow, if we —

Q

10

11

Well, you conceded that if they were given the

A

If we conceded, yes that's exactly right.

12

That's what the court, I believe, led the jury to believe that

13

we had conceded it.

14

Q

Well, but the judge, also in defining libel,

15

however, if the jury -- if it was left to the jury to determine

16

whether or not the charges of blackmail the way it was used was

17

charged a crime.

18

A

That's right, and then he further instructed --

clear instruction that the defendants not only charges, but the

17

knew that they were charging; they intended to charge this

strange and really ludicrous meaning of — they knew it was

19

false.

20

Q

Well, may I ask this:

1" gather from what you

21

said to me earlier, after the New York Times charge was given

22

the correct one, that Mr. Clark — that was trial counsel, I

23

gather —

That5 s right.

— said that he still objected in view of the
42

prior instructions which had gone before this and in which

ifaalice was averted to as involving hostility, that this should

3

be made clear to the jury that evidence of evil motive, ill-

4

will, hostility, does not constitute malice within the defini­

5

tion of the constitution.
I gather even had that been given you would still be

That he is a public figure; not only concede

that he was a public figure, but that there was previous wide­

about the magnitude of importance of his duties there:"vast

activities.

position at trial at any time that he was not a public figure?

to a public issue, but he raised the issue with the City Council

had some question, about it, because it did say that the Times

being libelous is concerned — it wouldn't make any difference

or not it satisfied the definition of libel.

10

In the context of what was involved — in other

words, the postponement of a condemnation action by an official

12

governmental body, I don't believe that that arises to the

13

stature of a libelous statement under the constitution.

Is it your point that this is a group libel, in

15

effect, by addressing the term "skulduggery" to the conduct of

16

the entire board and not any one person?
A

17
18

That certainly is my point and also there is

just no showing it's false.
Q

Before you can show falsity you would have to
