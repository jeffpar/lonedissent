MR. LANGSTON:

May it please the Court?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

HR. LANGSTON:

Mr. Langston?

This is an original action brought by

13

the State of Arkansas against the State of Tennessee under

14

constitutional provision for original action and boundary' "dis­

The case reaches here on a Motion for Leave to File
a Complaint, Statement in Support, of the Coiripla.in.fc, Statement

in Support of the Motion and Complaint filed by the State of

Arkansas against the State of Tennessee,

The Court accepted the case and appointed the Senior

District Judge from the State of Minnesota, the Honorable Gunnaj
Nordbye, to sit as a Special Master in this case,
A hearing was held in Memphis, Tennessee, in August
and September of 196 8.

The Master* entered his report finding

against the interests of the State of Arkansas, and the case

now comes before this Court on Exceptions filed by the State

2

of Arkansas -to that report and our Brief in support thereof.
As a preliminary statement concerning this case, when

this case came to the attention of the State of Arkansas we

5

hired a special counsel, George Cracraft of Helena, who is a

S

specialist in this type of field concerning river boundaries.

7

In Arkansas there are few specialists in this and we felt that

8

he was specially qualified to handle this case.
However, after the case was tried and it was briefed

to the Master, Mr, Cracraft was elected a chancery judge
in 1968 and began his term of office in. 1969,

Cracraft would handle this case for us here before this Court,
but we discovered a constitutional provision in Arkansas, which
is Article 7, Sections, which prohibits our judges from prac­
ticing lav/ in both State and Federal Courts,
To move on, the area in controversy between 'the States

any witness who was presented could recall.

Arkansas upon the complaint of its citizens who lived in
Crittenden County, adjacent to this area, and who had since

Just hardwood timber and things of that

nature that would grow in low-type areas in the alluvial valley

of the Mississippi River.

Does this record show anywhere the likely or

probable tax that either of the states would ---

6

A

I don't believe it does, Your Honor.

7

Q

Of course, somebody has been paying taxes on it

to some state, have they not?
A

9

We contended that they had been paid to the

10

State of Arkansas, Your Honor, and that the private citizens

11

had conveyed it consistent with the State of Arkansas and that

12

no one from the State of Tennessee had aver been on it and

13

that our people had been on it, had farmed it, paid taxes on it,

14

and conveyed it in accordance with the laws of Arkansas.
Q

When you say our people, I am not sure just what

The State of Arkansas' citizens, Your Honor.

Or people who thought they were Arkansas' citi­

19

zens.

20

get that out of the record.

21

^

Did they live on, was there residence there?

A

I couldn't

There was at one time,. I think, a man by the

22

name of Paget who lived out there, but most of all it was mostly

23

people who had adjoining lands cn Arkansas that extended their

24

lines on out into this particular area.

25

Q

What did the Master find about that?
6

A

1
2

On the part of the acquiesence of our people

being out there, he found against the State of Arkansas.
y

We also placed evidence in the record that Crittenden

3
4

County, Arkansas, built roads and that our t$arae and Fish

5

Commission patrolled the area for game laws, and that our offi­

0

cers, police officers, policed the area,
As early as 1933, according to the record in this

7
8

case, some litigation was conducted with regard to this land

9

in the courts of Tennessee and various claims were made by the

10

citizens of Tennessee to the lands from that date.
However, the record, we think, clearly reflects that

11
12

no claimant of the State of Tennessee has ever put foot on this

13

grmand and not tilled or cut and removed any timber from the

14

land.

15

We believe that if counsel for Tennessee would be

'i6

completely candid with the Court they would admit such claims of

17

citizens of Tennessee have ever made to the property to the date

18

19
20
21

of this hearing have been paper claims only and that the only
actual physical occupation of the area has- been accomplished by
Ltizens of the State of Arkansas.
We believe that the record is also silent to anything

22

that the State of Tennessee as a sovereign

23

improve either the value or the use of this area.

24

25

has ever done to

So, with this background in mind, the officials of
Crittenden County, the county judge, the tax assessor and other
-

7

1

officials over in Crittenden County prevailed upon the attorney

2

general and prevailed upon the governor of Arkansas to request

O

the attorney general to bring this suit in the name of the State

4

of Arkansas to determine who owned this property.

5

On the whole case, the Master found the fact of

6

acquiescence, which is the citizens of Arkansas being on the

7

land, he found this in favor of the State of Tennessee, and as

8

we understand the function of the Master who was appointed by

S

this Court, these findings are not to be set aside lightly or

10

if there is any basis, any evidence at all this court will

11

sustain them.

Vie cannot seriously urge that in these exceptions to

12

this Court to set aside those findings.

13

Now, the State of Arkansas3 second prone of position

'14

15

is that even though we have not acquired the ownership of all

16

this area by acquiescence power, the exercise of complete domin­

17

ion and control over it for a long period of fciraq, that certainly

18

a smaller portion of the area than that claimed by the State of

19

Tennessee was actually part of its domain originally.
The exception which we do urge is not a factual one

20
£1

but is one of law,and the position of the State of Arkansas in

22

these exceptions is that even if the basic facts as found by

23

the Master are true he^applied the incorrect rule of law to the

24

facts in the location of the state line.
That brings us to the first argued point in our brief

25

-i

8

-

!

which is that, the Master erred in concluding that the boundary

2

continued to move as long as the abandoned channel flowed dur­

3

ing high water»

4

In this argument on page 8 of our written brief, the

5

rule is adopted by the Master which he felt was controlling,

S

and I think both sides agree, which is based on a decision in

7

Arkansas v. Tennessee to the effect that though the main channel

8

is a movable one in the channel of navigation in a navigable

9

stream that after an avulsion and as a result of an avulsion the

>

10

change in boundary iai&oso^ffacted.

1!

The case rules as stated on page 8, the effect of an.

12

avulsion is not complete until it stagnates and ceases to run,

13

and as long as the channel remains a running stream, the bound­

14

ary marked by it may be moved by an erosion.

15

But we contend that once stagnation occurs the pro­

to

cess then is at an end., and we quote from that case, "The

\7

boundary then becomes fixed in the middle of tine channel as

18

this court has defined it and the gradual filling up of the

19

bed that ensues is not to be treated as an accretion to the

20

shores but as an ultimate effect of the avulsion.'1

21

s

How” the Master in his report while he. did recognise

22

this rule and quoted if in his report,, has very clearly erroneous­

23

ly applied the rule in the same manner that Tennesseans principal

24

witness, Mr. Rodgers, misapplied it in -the quoted testimony on

25

page 9 of our argument.
9

Mr, Rodgers states that his entire report as to the

!

2

location of the line between the two states in the matters

3

based upon the application of the rule that I just recited

4

when the water stagnates at ordinary high water and when it

S

ceases to run at ordinary high water instead of at lot* water,
He also admitted in the same quoted testimony that he

6
7

did not know and made no attempt to establish the line along

8

that area where 'trie water stagnated at low water.
Q

in the old abandoned channel that the Master never did find

when the water stagnated at low water which we claim that this

17

Court has said you must do.

18

We feel that

He did contend that he followed that rule but he
i

IS

couldn51 have because he followed the testimony of Rodgers who

20

never did set the time that the water first stagnated and the

21

line became fixed,

i

22

Mr, Rodgers kept saying that every time high water

23

would corae in it would erode away and move the boundary, and it

24

kept creeping into the Arkansas shore,

25

Tire Master adopted Mr, Rodgers® testimony that the
10

1

boundary in the old abandoned channel keeps moving every time

2

high water comes in and there is some more erosion.

3
4

Q

If he's correct in that, was his judgment

correct?

S

A

Yes, Your Honor, if he is correct in saying that

6

the boundary does not become fixed when the water* first stag­

7

nates and doesn't move, then the State of Arkansas doesn't have

8

a case.

9

But if the rule is that the water the first time it

10

stagnates, which we contend it did in about 1917 or 1918, then

11

his report is erroneous.

12

Q

13

that right?

14

A

That3s correct. Your Honor.

15

Q

Haver, even if the river by natural ——

A

Unless the river came back and cut all the way

Well, on your theory it could never change, is

passed the old, dead thalweg.
Q

Well, after the avulsion, there was a new channel

That's a different location.

20

A

That is correct.

21

Q

Which was the main channel of the river arid the

22

old channel was still, had soma wafer in it? *

23

A

That's correct.

24

Q

You think that when that new channel was acti­

25

vated and the old one became stagnate, as soon as it became
11

1

you should consider that it was a dead thalweg --

and that should stabilise the boundary at that

6

Q

4

Right,

point?

the Special Master found that it didn't,

1

although the new thalweg was active, the new channel was active,

8

there was also,he thought, an old channel that was active still

9

affective to change the boundary of the river?

10

A

At high water,

11

Q

At high water?

tz

A

That's correct.

13

Q

That as

long as the old channel, though dead,

14

had some water in it at high water that water could if it washed

15

away into the shore of Arkansas, the boundary of the state could

16

change?

17

A

That°s correct, Your Honor.

I believe that is

18

the Master8s contention and it is our contention that most of

19

the water stagnated the dead thalweg became the fixed boundary.

20

Q

What, you are saying is that once, as soon as the

21

water stagnates, then if you really do know there has been an

.22

avulsion, that there is a new channel active?

23

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

24

Q

If you fail on that point, that is the end of the

25

case, isn't it?

was? namely, that at a certain time the old channel was dead

23

and at that moment the boundary line was fixed?

We insist here that this cannot be what this Court

14

i

intended in its prior decisions or that it intended for these

2

old avulsions or cutoffs should remain in dispute and fluid for­

3

mally years»

4

The only other witness who testified as to these

5

matters was Austin Smith whose qualifications were set forth

6

in the transcript of the record on page 40 through 47 who has

7

testified in many matters involving state lines, over 100 in

3

number»

9

' I think he has participated in soma-16 of these cut-

10

offs such as this and whose opinion has been accepted by this

11

Court on at least two recent occasions which are referred to

12

in our brief»

13

!

It was the testimony of our witness, the State of

14

Arkansas’ witness, that his training and experience indicated clc ar

15

that in a cutoff of this kind stagnation would occur immediately

15

and within two or three years»

37

There are no maps or data available as to when stag­

18

nation occurred, but his experience in these cutoffs and he call­

30

ed upon his training being with the Mississippi River Commission

20

for 35 years in charge of navigation and dredging, that stagna­

21

tion would occur within two years from 1915 to 1916 when the

.22

cutoff became complete»

23

In quotations from the record set forth on page 12 of

24

our argument, Mr» Smith indicates that within a couple of years

25

the land would stagnate and become sedimented and at low water

-

15

1

would have no flow*

2

The State of Tennessee has criticised or has taken

3

the State of Arkansas to task in its brief concerning that we

4

say that Austin Smith gave the only competent testimony in

5

this case.
What v?e me an by competent evidence is that Rodgers base a

8
7

his entire report on an improper premise.

8

his testimony incompetent that he didn't find when the water

i

first stagnated but that he said the line remained fluid when

10

That is what makes

water flowed through there at ordinary high water.

ii

That is the reason why we contend that his testimony

12

concerning that is incompetent because he based it on. a false

13

premise«,

14

As for Our second argument, ---

15

Q.

How about an improper legal preraise? Yoi

think

16

the test should be When the channel stagnates at low water, and

IT

your opponents think the test should be when the channel stag­

18

nates at high water?

19

A

How, the State of. Tennessee says that the Master

20

never did find that, but 1 think from the conclusions from that

21

you have got to say that that he did, by not saying that, he did

22

say that because the map that he attaches to his report follows

23

idle line by Rodgers and that was Rodgers8 testimony and there

.24

couldn’t have been any other way he could have reached it.

I know, but when he says he saw a foot of water

there as late as — after 1955 a foot of water when?

A

At ordinary high water.

So, he is saying that

the water never has stagnated.

Q

Well at high water, but what about at low water*?

A

He never says.

19

That is the reason why we say

his testimony is incompetent.

3

The next point that we attempt to make in our Excep­

I just don't remember on that point, Your Honor.

4

tions is really based on our first contention that if the Court

S

does not hold for the State of Arkansas on its first contention

6

then the second contention is also out.

7

Then the

second contention is that the Master erred

8

in extending the Tennessee lands laterally downstream so as to

9

deny Arkansas access to the navigable channel.

~W

The idea that the State of Arkansas is attempting to

II

develop here is that the state lines are supposed to be perma­

12

nent and supposed to be fixed and supposed to be known and that

13

this Court didn't intend for them to remain fluid and movable

14

after one of these avulsions indefinitely.

15

We are saying that this Court wants after an avulsion-

16

it wants the state line to be set and not be moving and be

17

fluid indefinitely 0

18

to become fixed at stagnation, it. meant as soon as stagnation,

19

but here we are dealing with an exception to the rule rather

20

than the rule and these exceptions should not be permitted to

21

override the rule itself.

22

Wherfien this Court indicated that it was

We think the whole idea is to fix the boundary and to

23

get it fixed as soon as possible while at the same time preserve

24

whatever rights either party might have and might have lost as

25

a result of the avulsion.

It
12

It is not a cure-all but simply something to preserve
as near as possible the rights of either party.

On this point,

we simply take the position that the Master’s Findings of Fact
kept the old channel open too long should have sedimented it
in Smith8s Scour as our witness Smith did it.
Within a few years thereafter it was low-water time,
and movement that it made after that period would have no effect
on the boundary because the boundary became fired.

We emphasis

that when stagnation occurred the old thalweg no longer existed,
it was dead.

The mew channel of the river was then the live

thalweg and above and below its point of intersection with the
dead thalweg, the live thalweg became movable.
We also emphasis the point that this Court should not

'13

14

permit the dead thalweg which is not alive, which has no life,
to override and control a live one.

This is all tied in with

13

our argument which is beginning on page 14 of our brief.

!6
The cases seem to hold very clearly that you can't
17

extend these formations upstream and downstream so far as to
13

cut off access and navigation.

This is historical and has

19

always run through our lav? as the right of access that seems
20

to give rise to this rule.
21

We don't want this Court to allow the State of
22
Tennessee to cut off the State of Arkansas' access to the river
23

for some-two miles upstream and four miles downstream from
24

the dead thalweg.

3

Your Honor, of course, the Federal government has

4

pretty much taken over navigation on these rivers but we feel

5

that the only answer X can give you is that we thought this out

that the access to the river is a right of property and should

You have indicated that people have been farming

only to the high-water mark and the State of Arkansas owns from
the high-water mark to the bed of the stream.

Did you say th-t if you lose out on the first

I belive it would, Your Honor, because the thal­

weg would have been moving each time under the Master’s theory.

7

It would have been moving downstream and upstream.

the Master found that the old thalweg had not died or it is

So, every time there is an erosion or something, well,
that moves what vie call the dead thalweg.

The next time we were able to find a survey or map was

in the year 1904* 1877 to 1904.- Here again we show the original

Tennessee lands and now the additional forming of the accretions

18

to the Tennessee shore.

20

The Mississippi River is again cutting-

further into the Stats of Arkansas and washing away its lands.
Now, 1 have drawn a'red line here to indicate where

this Arkansas shore was in 1877 so you can see how far between

Now, as of the date of that map to which you are

10

it remains in the thalweg which is generally the deepest part

of the river, not always, but it is where the boats go,

13

to the Arkansas bank?

14

A

Might not very well a band like that be closer

According to the measurements, now, on, these maps

15

of 1904 and the later one 1912, the engineers actually measured

18

the depth of the water that is colored blue here.

17

those maps carefully, you can

18

By examing

see how deep the water is.

Those measurements in most cases would be like one

19

foot here, two feet, five feet, 10 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet and

20

within two feet of the bank, it would be 30 feet deep on the out er

21

rim of the wheel.

22

In other words, the water there is what they call a

23

bluff bank.

It would very sharply drop right down to a very

24

deep depth, and the boats actually run in close to the shore

25

as they go around this bend.

In this case you will see that the river has moved

considerably again into Arkansas and that there is the beginning

8

of the avulsion, that we speak of, that occurred in 1913»
How, according to this question about the river stag-

-9
10

nating at low water or high water, which we will get to in a

11

few minutes, at this time the river was at 11 feet, and at 11

12

feet this depth through here was some seven or eight feet.

13

that if we follow this low water or zero water, then at that

14

time we had. no channel through here. We had no avulsion because

15

at zero water this was all dry land from right here to right

16

here.

17

Q

What do you mean zero water?

13

A

I ant going to explain that in detail later, I

19
20

might as well do it now.
The engineers designate the elevation of the land,

2?

including the river by feet or numbers.

22

279 feet on this shore from sea level at the Gulf of Mexico.

23

In otlier words, the land rises a total of 279 feet.,

24
25

All right.

For instance, it is

At these locations, for the sake of

They have established an arbitrary zero as they call

2

it at some 260 feat above the Gulf level and that is the lowest
point to which fcha river will ordinarily go during its ups and

4

downs during the season,

5

Q

That is low water?

6

A

lto, sir, the low water is 3,2 feet above zero.

7

Now, the point is that it is an arbitrary figure for

8

the purpose of these men on the river to know whether the river

&

is shallow or whether they have got a lot of water because as

10

it gets shallow, every time they come to a crossing in the river

11

it will be five or six feet deep or maybe eight feet deep,and

they have got to be very careful in getting across or they will

5

A

That is right? in the middle.

6

Now, to understand this low and high water, the point

7

that the State of Arkansas has confused here is they speak of high

8

water and -they do not distinguish between ordinary high water

9

and high water.
Ordinary high water that was spoken of by Mr. Rodgers

10
I!
12

is 18 feet on this Memphis Guage „ --That is known as mid-bank
stages.

High 'water or flood water is around 40 feet on the

13

14

Memphis Guage.

A

23
24
25

The flood waters as we speak of them cire when

they get above that figure.

In other words# the 40 feet would

be the measurement at the top of the bank and above that the
water will flow over into the lowlands.
Nov?, it is still confined within the levees until

21

22

Isn't there a difference between high water and

flood water?

17
S8

There the river is just up good above this low stage.

it gets above 50 and 55 feet, but it is over its own banks at
40 feet.
To this point in time, this is 1912, 1915, the State
of Arkansas has conceded and agreed with Tennessee that these

accretions moved over into this position and that the Arkansas

2

shore was eroded to that position, that the approximate state

11

Now, Your Honors, when this case first began in 1968,

12

the State of Arkansas said there was no avulsion.

That is what

13

they plead in the case, there was no avulsion.

14

the river migrated. New,migration is by erosion and accretion,

They said that

They said that the river migrated up to this position

16
17

in 1912.

back down so that today where it has migrated is the same river

19

we had here and there was no avulsion, and that is the statement

of their expert witness.

In the middle

of the hearing before the Master, they admitted that this avul­

to where it did today it migrated on farther westward to a posi­
tion about like that where it stagnated at low water.

That is

the argument of Arkansas.
But on that point their witness on whom they are
relying made this statement,, and it is in the record, that "the

lour Honor, on page 7 of the Master's Report, in

And in the Master's rule the state line would,

Even if it is no longer an active channel for

navigation or for anything else?

18

That is the point. Your Honor.

If there is

It could not be otherwise.

In 1932 a river boat 125 feet long and 15 feet wid^

there at all because even though water was flowing in there at

that time it was not an active channel and there was no way

for the regular boats to go in there,

the only time that it would effect a state line is when if be­

9

Q

—

I suppose you would agree that if there are

r

10

these various stages of the river, which I take it everyone

11

agrees there are, that that channel could be stagnate in the

12

sensa that there would be. no erosion or accretion at the

13

lowest stages of the river»

14

Yet, at other times of the year at higher water there

15

'would be a lot more water flowing through that old channel and

16

might it on those occasions erode, and the Master would say

17

as long as that is so the boundary changes?

13

A

No, sir, Your Honor, let me explain where, and

19

let’s take this particular situation as an example.

20

In 1929, this channel had already closed.

How, there j

is a peculiar phenomena that goes on when a channel is abandoned,

22

and this you will find in the reports of both Mr. Smith

You mean the channel was closed to navigation?

A

The channel closes itself.

It wasn't physically closed?

Q

Sure.

And the front end or the head of it as they call

7

it will silt up, and at almost any stage except real high water

8

you will not have sufficient flow.

It will be some but not

How* that is what Mr. Rodgers was explaining that he

Q

7
8

Mr. Sutton, was the cross-examination of Mr.

Smith, based on what you just said?

9

A

Yes, sir, we cross-examined him.

10

Q

And he conceded, did he, that he had not referred

11

to the maps?

12

A

Your Honor, Mr. Smith never conceded, anything

13

and we had considerable difficulty getting him to answer a

14

question, and that is why you will find the record is someft
1,300 pages, and the Master had to comment on that more than

15

16

once.
He made this statement in the course of his discussion^.

17
18

That he first said that there was no avulsion here.

That was

19

his statement, that the river moved up to this place and then

20

it moved back.

21

22

Then he says, "Well, I just couldn't get over

that island so I had to admit there was an avulsion there, but
I'm not sure today."
Now, this is their expert witness in ‘the Arkansas

23
24

testimony.

"I am not sura today, 1965, but that my first

25

theory was the better one."

That is the testimony of the man

He doesn't know whether there is an

So that we are faced with the tsstimony of a man who

4

says now that the river stagnated at Smith’s scour when he

5

first said it didn’t stagnate at all.

6

So, I can understand why the Master did not accept

7

his theory.

3

Rodgers’ theory about the ordinary high water, he just said when

9

it ceases to flow or have erosion and accretion then it stag­

10

1!

Let me say this,, the Master didn’t accept Mr.,

nated and he says this river stagnated.
Q

I don’t know how ranch difference it would make

12

in this case, but if the Master were wrong about saying that

13

as long as there is accretion or erosion at any stage of the

14

river through the old channel

15

A

He doesn't say that.

13

G

Well that is what you said a moment ago.

As

17

long as there is erosion or accretion in that old channel, the

18

boundary changes.

19

difference in this case, but if he is wrong in that, why that

20

perhaps is the issue, one of the issues here.

21

A

If he is wrong in that, it may not make much

Your Honor, he didn’t, say at any stage.

He

22

said that the water becomes stagnate, that is his first state­

23

ment, and erosion and accretion no longer occur the boundary

24

becomes fixed.

25

Q

Well, X asked you a while ago if that statement
-

-98

would cover a situation where erosion and accretion take place
at some times of the year but not at others if it takes place

3

at high water or at ordinary high water at about

8 feet it.

4

takes place but at ordinary low water it doesn't.

I would

5

suppose that statement of the Master would include that kind of

erosion.

I don't think that is what he meant by it.

In this case the upper end of this channel that is

So we have no active channel even though water may flow in there

Before I go further, I would, say this that in trying

to describe what is going on from now on, I would like to use

12

the face of a clock and say that the beginning point of this

Cow Island Ben-dwould be at three o'clock on the face of a clock,

14

that the top of it would be at 12 o'clock would be where the

channel begins and get in close to the Arkansas shore and re­

mains there on around and goes on. around from 12, 11, 10, 9’,

and 6 which is the bottom of the area in dispute.

18

Now, Your Honor, the State of Arkansas has made a

19

statement and furnished you in their brief the area, that they

20

claim is from which they measured this two miles downstream and

21

three miles upstream and so on.

22

That is incorrect.

What they have done, in 1913 there was a flood which

23

started this avulsion across here and the purpose there was a

24

man who went out and made a freehand sketch on an old map show­

25

ing this channel cut through here during that high water.
-

50

-

7

f

At the same time* he made a general triangular area

2

which he said was the remaining land of Tennessee that was cut

3

off.

4

time, and this was the amount of land, .all of this pink area,

5

was the amount of land that was visible above those flood waters

S

in 1913.

That was during flood water which was 54 feet at that

8

The State of Arkansas has taken the extreme north
part of that 1913 high water.

Now remember this that this land j

at that moment in 1913 was much larger than this picture shows.
.

9

10

As the river comes up, it covers more of the edge of the shore.

So, naturally you don't have as much land sticking out of the

12

water, but when the river went back down all of this land appear­

Now, there you have the difference between what we

Now they also on their exhibit --

Q

Even though the river 'had come back and had

joined with the old abandoned channel to some extent, the state
line still remained in the old place?
A

It went just a little further into Arkansas be­

cause the active channel was eroding away.

In other words, the

two combined channels as they went south from this point remaine
up against the bank.
Now the reason for that — let's go back to oar origi­

nal picture — and you have the rim of a wheel and around the
rim of that wheel the keenest part was in close to the bank
and the channel remained there although it became active, that

2

The next period of time in which there is a survey,

3
now remember there were maps between 1913 and 19 9 but they were
4
not full survey maps, there was a map in 1917 and 1918 and there
5

6

9
10
11

was another map in 19 1. Then we have this partial survey of 19 5,
but the next full one is in 19 9 at which time, now here is this
19 5 line and the river — the new channel only has reversed
itself and started back south building accretions and here is
the 'aerial photograph showing that and here are the accretions
it is just sand you can see it that it was built but you can
see that this channel has not moved.

12
13
14

It is still there.

These accretions built only to this part that is In
Tennessee and that the water remained between the Tennessee
lands and the Arkansas lands at all times.,

15

As the land built down, it simply separated the new

16

channel from the old one because it always remained up against

17

that bank *

18

Between 19 5 and 19 9 it eroded this bank just very

jslightly

19

After 19 9, nothing has moved»

In other words, the

20

position of the old abandoned channel has been the same from 19 ?

21

to today even though it was active for a time between 1915 and

22

1925.

Who owned it at that time?

May I ask you if the record shows that any pri-

11

There is a record of a 'Tennessee land owner claixa-

That was before Arkansas was a state.

Yes*, sir.

Is there any later than that?

17

Is there any

A

I say he traces his title down to the present

that now it is back up.
I might say this.

If this case goes long' enough* we

We don’t think it is quite that much.

We think it is now about

That would only be developed by a survey.

It has increased and decreased because this new

It was beginning to eat back up this way again.

They are down there putting in new dikes*

In

other words* this new channel just keeps going up and down like
that.

The old channel has remained silent ever since then.

this particular map by the man from Arkansas and he shows the ol 3

on rather quickly with the presentation of the picture from
these maps.
After 1929? the next official map that had a survey on

It was

never formed in any part of Arkansas nor on this side of the
old Bendway Channel that has again become inactive as the new
channel moved away from it.
The next year on which there was a survey was 1949.
In this one you v/ill notice that the land here has increased
in size greatly because the avulsive channel has moved south

12

and washed away a great deal of the original Tennessee lands,

13

put it here.

14

That is where is gets to that approximately 4,000 or

15

5,000 acres, but, again, in the next period of time which is 1965

16

and the survey in 1967, you will notice that a great deal of

The only change with this land between 1929, which was

I would like to wind this up by making soma state­

There is no

evidence in this case that Tennessee ever acquiesced in the
State of Arkansas8 claim of sovereignty over this particular
land.
Mote that the Master found to that effect no evidence
that the/ever acquiesced, and as far as prescription is con­
cerned, they can, of course, obtain the control of this land if
Tennessee acquiesced in their control of the land.
The record is replete here with law suits from 1932.

In 1932, there was a suit in the Federal District Court at Mem­

The State of Tennessee in their brief and in their

When we did draft our pleadings, we did allege that

there was no avulsion.

This was based on testimony.

This was

rhere had not been some sort of an avulsion here.
They say that Smith, our expert, changed his testimony
[ think I can explain to the Court why his testimony was changed,
Then he first started testifying,concerning this in private liti­
gation, he took the position that there had been no avulsion.
reason why he did this was that at that time the law in this
>articular area had not become definite or crystallised and was
lot certain.
Smith took the position that around 15 years ago that
this, what they call a middle bar or nrad bar that became this

that, yes, when the avultive part was, you could see it at low

That is the reason why his testimony was changed from

the time we pled and at the time of the trial.

his position is inconsistent.

this case into consideration, by the state's attorneys, when

How much tax is Arkansas getting out of this

property now?

A

Your Honor, I do not know.

Is it getting any?

I think severance taxes may be off of timber and

25

a few things like that but I don't think the taxes would be

Yes# it has been forfeited

I am advised that someone asked how much farming land

there was on it,

farmed, there now.

There is approximately 500 acres that can be

Out of 5#000?

Out of 5#000.

Could a farmer keep his home and his place for

18

his mules, tools and everything over in Arkansas and farm over

on that island?

20

A

Yes# Your Honor# that is what they are doing.

21

Q

That is what they are doing?

22

A

That is what our citizens are doing.

23

Q

Is there any evidence in the record that the

farmers are doing that?

Yes# Your Honor.

We have farmed it all along, our citizens have,

Q

And that is in the record?

A

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

Well, I suppose it is not uncomrsKm on land

boundaries for a farmer to have a farm that has got a couple
of hundred acres in one state and some spill over into the
next state.

9

A

There is nothing unique about that, is there?
1 wouldn't think so.

Of course, here the river

10

wouldn't make it too feasible but you could own some on both

11

sides.

12

I think Mr. Sutton, when he was being questioned by

13

Mr. Justice White, clearly shows that the Arkansas position is

14

the one that should be accepted by this Court.

15

The prior case of Arkansas v. Tennessee says that

16

when the stream stagnates and ceases to flow and it smells bad

17

then that is when the line is set, that any erosion or accre­

18

tion is a natural result of that avulsion.

19

Mr. Sutton wants these accretions and erosions to

20

keep moving this line even though it is not the channel any

21

more.

22

sions and accretions and sedimentations is a natural, result of

23

the dying of the old thalweg.

24
25

The case of Tennessee v. Arkansas says that these ero­

That is why this Court has to decide when and where
the old thalweg died because if it keeps eroding and keeps

accreting, it is really not dead.

which is what this Court "doesric t. in its prior decisions seeraes t>

3

say it doesn81 want to da„

4

'thalweg inactive and then let the new one control the rands .

It keeps moving and xt is fluil

It wants to have the old dead

5

Q

What do you mean not fluid?

6

Q

I gather Tennessee concedes that the old channel

7

died some years ago and is now dead and that the boundary won't

8

change any more.

9

A

He says that, but the accretions that are attached tc

10

it and the erosions that are attached to it will move the state

11

line.

His position is that it hasn't done it, though.
Q

12

Not up in the north and westerly end of that

13

territory.

It doesn't seem to me that even it you have some

14

difference about what the test ought to be when the old channel

15

dies, if you both agree that that state line in 1912 was where

16

that map showed it was.

1?

A

We don't agree where it was, Your Honor.

18

Q

In 1912?

19

A

That is right.

20

'fee State of Tennessee claims that these accretions

21

and erosions have moved

Well, if the state line is where he says it 'was

of Cow Island, if the state line is where he said it was, the

accretidns were on the Tennessee side of that line.

That is not our position,, Your Honor.

Qur

O

position is that the accretions built down from the Arkansas

shore and attached to this avulsion there.

Yes, that is your second point, isn’t it?

Correct, yes.

one.

I am talking about the first

Well how about the first point?
A

We claim that the thalweg died in around 1918 in

that particular point and it could not move any further.
Q

Let's assume you are right on that, what is the

consequence of that?

13

A

Any movement of it —-

14

Q

Well there wouldn't be any more on your position.

15

A

That is correct.

IS

Q

I didn't know that he indicates that to the west

17

and the north of that island -- he doesn't claim that the state

18

line changed any.

19

A

Your Honor, it is our position that this avultive

20

area kept eroding away and got to where Smith's Scour was when

2?

the thalweg died.

22

The important thing here, we think, for the Court to

23

decide is when and where this thalweg died, set the boundary

24

line there in a definite place and apportion these lands in

25

accordance therewith„

We either ask the Court to reverse the conclusions
of the Master and enter findings in consistency with our posi­
tion or to sene, the matter back for further proceedings.
Q

Is there anything in the record that shows why

Arkansas filed this law suit?
A

Your Honor, we filed this law suit on the basis

of requests from officials

of

Crittenden County who were pre­

vailed upon by private citizens who were involved there.
Q

Is that shown in the record?

A

I think it is, Your Honor.

The county officials

prevailed upon the Governor to request the Attorney General fco
file the law suit.

It originates from these private persons

v7ho were involved in litigation in Tennessee -- private Arkansas
persons who claimed the land.
Q

Mr. Langston, I was about to ask you a question

15
which has nothing to do with the merits of the case

but

per­

16
haps you could answer, if you know.

Is there &ny jurisdictional

17
constitutional reason why your state, the State of Arkansas,

18
could not agree with another state,, the State of Tennessee , for

19
example, by legislative action to submit this kind of a dispute

20
to a joint commission established by the two states?

Would you

21

be legally permitted to do it?

Wow, that may be a large legal

22
question but if you know, I would be interested in your answer.

23
A

We have taken the position that the Tennessee

24
litigation which decided the issue in favor of the Tennessee

25
-

72

1

people would preclude our Arkansas residents of filing anything

2

in the State Courts of Arkansas.

3

Q

I didn't mean in the courts.

I mean a joint

commission established by the legislatures of two contending

5

states with an agreement to submit it to final and binding

S

arbitration instead of bringing it under the constitutional

provisions here.
