On July 24th, 1966 in the City of Birmingham, Alfoams.,-

black individuals attacked a white man and his wife on the ■

The Court has interpreted- the Sixth hmenaeent to

mean that Counsel is needed at the. accusatory sines; at the

interrogation; at the linkup; at the arraignment; at the

Q

This is not the same animal that was before

the Court in Hamilton against Alabama.

That’s a vary confusing case.

That was an arraignment; was it not?

ease is confusing, because of it being called a preliminary
hearing and it really is not? it's an arraignment where a plea
is required.
Our statute is very similar to the statute in Points:
versus Texas, where the Court said the preliminary* hearing is
not a critical stage because a plea was not required.
the verbatim statement that, was in the White case.

Almost
However,

the Court said, and I quote from the opinions "Whether there
might be other circumstances making a preliminary hearing so
critical to the defendant as to call for appointment of
counsel, at that stage we need not decide cr. this record and
that question we reserve." It is the question in which yon
have decided — in which you have reserved, in Pointer versus
Texas, that we raise here.

Q

To answer Mr.Chief Justice and Mr. Justice

Stewart we would offer these reasons as towhy preliminary
hearing is important and s3coi'-vss;s5s more then simply probable
cause or whether or not a plea is required.
It is the first coportunitv the defendant has to
he adequately informed by an allegedly impartial person, '.for
that with which he is charged.

(3) It is the first opportunity to or.-a-in* those who '
will testify against him and have their testimony reSiaeaf t
writing.
Q

Let me ask you — if I may interrupt you

do you say you examine the witnesses against hi.su

Do you meat

by that the witnesses who are produced at the hearing or all
the witnesses who will be produced at the trial.
A

All the witnesses produced at the hearing and

ail the witnesses subpoenaed by the defendant to testify on hi.a
own behalf.

And any other witnesses that counsel can find to

subpoena or to have present at the preliminary hearing .
Q

in this respect; then, it* a parallel to the

Federal situation?
A

Yes,

Your

Hortar? inthe sense that in the Federal

Court obviously the reason why preliminary hearings are not —
numerous preliminary hearings are not held is because of the

Q

Well, are you suggesting that the Alabama

statute contemplates that the preliminary hearing is a dis­

covery mechanism?

20

A

It says, if Your Honor please, that it is to

determine probable cause and to —

22

Q

Probable cause for what — a holding?

23

A

To. bind the defendant over to the grand jury,

24

Now, as Your Honor is well aware■, "probable' cause"

25

means more than just a brief statement by some individual that

What is.- the arraignment stage? is it after the

The arraignment comas after the. preliminary

hearing and subsequent to the indictment,

13

where the indictment is read to the defendant and a plea is

14

entered at that time.
But, no lawyer who lias ever tried a criminal ease.,

15
IS
17

in Alabama or anywhere else in a state court where a pre­
liminary hearing is offered, would dare testify that it is net

18

important»

19

all the proceedings.

20

Arraignment is

It is probably the single-most critical stage of

Q

It reduces a trial to r. mere formality,

Let. me ask you this questions

Under your

21

Alabama procedure, could the state have bypassed the pre­

22

liminary hearing and have gone right before the grand jury?

23
24
25

A

It-could, if Your Honor please.

It could do

that, however we have introduced in our brief and into the
trial of the notion before His Honor Judge Gibson, that 95

way of the pre ticiaecy he aria-. „

3

of facti, I can *t even remember one since I have bean pracfeicin J

4

law.which has been for five years, where a case was taken

3

directly to the grand jury without going through a preliminary

6

hearing..

7
8

'very, very few -- as-a matter

It's just a matter of procedure.
Q

It would be open to the state to do that;

Even

if you prevailed in this case.

10

But if-they did, courts in.a
■ j
populous county such as Jefferson County, they might foe there

n

five years before they ever got to trial if every case had to

12

go before the grand jury, upon which•a warrant is svorn out
\
and on a felony it’s justi hot possible.

3

A

They could do it.

.

13

14

So that the preliminary hearing weeds the case:., cat.,

16

so to speak, before they get to the grand jury.
;
So, there are 17-reasons listed in ray brief.

17

of course, have a collective mind and you will read my brief.

15

You,

18

Ttee is really no need in my just reading out of aiy brief the

19

17 points that just first same into ray mind and on Page 11 arid

20

Page 12 and Page 13 of my brief, which list the many, many

21

reasons for preliminary hearings *
.

On a selected basis, X read your 17 points.

22
23
24
25

What do you lay the most emphasis on?
A

Discovery is the -most emphasis.

The motion fcc

suppress many times has been very favorable, ahd’m‘any cases
9

1

have been dismissed in the preliminary hearing as a result o&

2

e. motion ho suppress.

4

or nine months that it takes to get to the trial or the merits

5

of the issue? not to mention the practical aspect, of its if

6

you have a good motion to suppress then the state will let it

7

pass for two years and then eventually maybe it will be dis­

3

missed.

9

many lawyers do, rather than the case just being dismissed.

But your client — and I have several of these, as

But it is the question reserved in Pointer versus.

10

11

Therefore, the man hasn't had to sit in

Texas that we apply to this particular case.
Q

12

Now —

I'm reading the sections of your statute on

13

Pages 3 and 4 of your brief and it talks about when the defen­

14

dant must be discharged and that's Section 139 and than Section

IS

140 it. talks about what happens if probable cause is shown.

16

He must be discharged on bail if he can make bail.

17

sufficient bail is not given he must be committed to jail.

16

Then what happens?
A

19

But if

Well, then he awaits the action of the grand

20

jury.

Then the grand jury acts than the indictment is presen­

21

ted; then an arraignment is held and counsel appointed, if

22

necessary? and then a plea is entered and then a trial.

23

Q

Yes.

The grand jury might not indict him.

24

A

Well, that’s possible; it la possible.

25

Q

And do you have any practice of charges brought
10

*3

ii

E
O

by informations?
A

No.

Just indictments.

It’s- possible, of

course, the grand jury wouldn't indict him, '-but I suggest to

4

you that if the grand jury wouldn't indict, him it would have

5

been dismissed at the preliminary hearing.

6

Q

7

Well, probably, but not always.
Well, anything is possible,- I guess.

But in

8

over the years in trying cases — criminal cases before the

9

preliminary hearing.

10

Most of them that are dismissed are

simply dismissed.

ii

Q

Don't your grand juries sometimes ignore it?

12

A

Our District Attorney controls the grand juries

13

Your Honor and he8s the only one —

14

Q

Could you talk a little louder?

15

A

The District Attorney controls the grand jury

16

and he's the only one in the grand jury room and it's his

17

witnesses that testify before the grand jury, so 1 would no

shocked that if the case were dismissed by the preliminary

19

hearing magistrate that the case would be picked up by the

20

which 1 am familiar in the jurisdiction where X used to live
the — sli the prosecution would do would- be to make a prima

I gather from your statute that yours is

quite different? that it imposes the duty upon a magistrate

— Section 138, "to examine all the witnesses having any
knowledge of any facts"relevant to such investigation, whether
such witnesses were summoned in behalf of the stata or the

ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ALABAMA, ON BEHALF

Mr. Chief Justice and'may it pleas* the

Court.

Only one matter has been discussed so far and that is

the question off the preliminary hearings in Alabama.

like to take issue with myopponent on that.

I would

The preliminary hearing' in Alabama is one of these

13
14

things in which an accused may ask for a preliminary hearing.

15

Now, when there is a preliminary hearing the magistrate looks

16

into the matter first, to determine if an offense has been ccsv"

17

mitted and then tothe probable cause that the question there

18

committed the offense.

19

such a matter which is subject to bail.

22

that these accused want to get oat on bail.

A

He didask for a preliminary,

Q

He asked fox- a preliminary.

3

A

I think that is correct, sir.

9

He asked for a

preliminary hearing? it was had on October 14 of 1966.

10

Q

The record will shew that he asked for it?

11

A

1. think that is correct, sir*

Well, can’t he get bail without having a pre-

13

liminary hearing?
A

14
15

Q

20
21

Well, is it a, rule that unless y>u have a pre­

liminary hearing you cannot' gat bail?
A

13
19

You may? you could file for habeas corpus and

they would set bail.

10

17

It could be set by the judge or clerks of the

courts sometimes in small matters'? misdemeanors and so forth.
Q

’ Well, what is the rule?

You said that the reason

J

they had preliminary hearings was to get bail ~

22

A

Is to get bail in a more serious offense.

23

Q

Why?

24

A

That’s the only way they can get it.

Why?

Why is that so?'

ago that a prosecutor could take his case directly to the
*

14
15

grand jury rather than have a preliminary hearing?
A

If the accused doesnot ask for a prelmirary

16

hearing then when the grand jury meets the matter may be

17

pre: snted to the grand jury and an indictment returned and

18

then, of course, you have the arraignment and trial.

19
20

Q

'But if the accused says, "2 waive a preliminary

hearing," is he also waiving bail?

21

A

In a sensei yes.

22

Q

He is?

23

A

Yes, Your Honor.

24

Q

Can he secure bail after the indictment by

25

applying to the court?

Mr. Clark, is -there some other reason for a

is- the one who —

17

Q

So there

18

A

Oh, yes.

19

20

22

is something more than just bail?
I wanted to point out that that was

one of the things.
Q

What about the section about reducing all of

this to writing?

that is required in the code and there is a prevision that if |

A

X cion31 know his financial status at that tins*

16

I think that Mr. Tartar said he was court-appointed, so I

17

assume the man. didnofc have money to pay for it.

16

Now, one of the contentions of Mr. Tartar in his

19

17 contentions he has got in his brief for the reasons he

20

should have- an attorney is that this matter could ha used at

21

That was one of the. contentiosis,

though, that Mr. Tartar pointed out.

But what I am saying is

10

that the testimony at the preliminary is only used occasional!']

to impeach a witness.

So, that's really the only purpose.

13

Now, I would like to point out that that would not

14

be in conflict with the Barber versus Page which Mr. Justice

15

Marshall wrote the opinion in that particular ease.

16

they read some of the -evidence from the preliminary into the

17

18

I think

1 would like to call the Court's attention to

Pages 7 and 8 of my brief in which I actually quoted the Court

20

of Appeals there, because of the purpose of the preliminary.

X couldn't say it better? X think that covers it.

It tells whether an offense has been committed and

23

whether to hold er release the accused and to determine bail

7

This happened prior to Wade or Gilbert.
Therefore, this would come up before the Court on

8

the question of whether, at this pretrial lineup when the

9

defendant did not have counsel, whether based on the totality

10

of the circumstances the confrontation was such that, so

11

They Were returning to their home in

I don't think so, if Your Honor please.

There

19

was a question brought up by Mr. Justice Stewart just a

21

pointed out that if a statement was made at the preliminary

both of them if they wished to testify.
