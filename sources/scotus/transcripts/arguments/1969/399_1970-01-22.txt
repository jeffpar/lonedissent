ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOSEPH TABACK, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

6

MR. TABACK:

7

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

8

Court:

The appeal here before this Court is from a judgment,

9

three-judge court in the United States District Court of

10

Central California.

11

upon Section 1253, Title 28 of the United States Code.

12

The jurisdiction of the Court is grounded

The Appellants are in the mail order business; they

13

are distributors and disseminators of books, pamphlets and

14

various matters of materials that traffic and conduct its way

15

through the mail.

16

The law which is brought here in focus by this

17

appeal is Section 3)1 of Public Law 90-206 or as codified,

18

39 U.S.C. 4009.

19

relief, and seeking an injunction against the enforcement,

20

implementation and administration of the statute.

The action below was that for declaratory

The result of the court below was a verdict, three to
nothing, upholding the constitutionality

i lie statute and

denying the relief sought.
Upon this appeal it does seem that the issues are made
much clearer than they were, even in the court below.
2

This has

1

come to be because the statute which, purportedly, was not

2

ambiguous, has now received the same interpretation of govern­

3

ment., as well as the Appellants herein.

4

is contrary to the construction emd interpretation given by

5

the U. S. District Court,

6

a matter which has occurred at the time of this appeal,

That interpretation

This is a new twist, if you will;

Q

How was that last; I didn’t hear what you said?

A

I said this is a matter which has now occurred

at the time of appeal.

Prior to that time, Mr. Justice, the

government, and mare particularly, at the time of their motion
to affirm, attempted to adopt the view and interpretation of
the U. S. District Court which, incidentally, was by way of
two votes with one interpretation, another vote for another
construction.
Q

In ti e District Court did the Government take

the position as to the meaning and construction of the statute
that it used here, or did it invite the District Court to take
the position that, 8".at court took?
A

Mr. Justice, in answer to your question, the

Government did take the view that they take here today in the
District Court.

However, upon examination by one of the three
j

22
23
24

judges, the government did become somewhat — took a dual role
if you will.

But, I will have to answer: they did adopt the

views they adopt today, in the District Court.
Q

But during the presentation of the case the

25
3

1

counsel perhaps saw which way the wind was blowing and trimmed

2

his sails a bit; didn't he?

3

A

I would believe that to be a fair statement, Mr»

5

Q

By "dual," you mean alternative positions, or —

6

A

In answer to your question, Mr» Justice, I feel

4

Justice.

7

that the government, took a very strong position in their

8

argument and therefore I cannot feel that it was an alternative

9

position, per se»

I think that would be my distinction.

discretionary determination the recipient may obtain the pro­

20

contents of the order are set forth in the statute.

The difficulty ■—■
Q

This is an accurate form in the back of your

opening brief; right?
A

Mr. Justice, that is Exhibit A to the Appellant'::

opening brief.

It is an exact order and it is an order arising

out of the case reference in the appendix of Lee J. Winkler,
which appears at page 22 of the appendix and is in connection
with matters set forth there.
The first principal problem, as I say, relates to
the First Amendment.

Appellants contend that you repose with­

in an addresse the discretionary power to say, "I do not want
anything that you send to me, any mail."

Appellants submit

that is a direct violation and in complete derogation of the
First Amendment,
Q

Tha» 'fi the cant-: isn’t it, right there?

A

Mr. Justice, that is certainly one of the
5

1

2

principal issues»
a

I think, in conjunction therewith, we have

secondary aspect of the First Amendment, and that is,

3

namely:

the further mailing of any materials," which, in that
It not only is a prohibi­

tion, but it is an inhibition, depending on which interpreta­
tion this Court might involve itself with or look at, for the
statutory construction.
Q

Well, is it your view that this statute is

broad enough so that it could reach Sears, Roebuck catalog, or
Montgomery Ward catalog?
A

Mr. Justice, it has reached the Sears, Roebuck

catalog, it has reached the "Family Heritage Bible;" it has
reached various organizations and I think that is the subject
of one of the amicus briefs here before this Court.
Q

And you think a citizen has no right to say to

15
16
17
18
19
20
2!
22
23
24

Sears, Roebuck or Montgomery Ward, "I don’t want your catalog;
don’t send it to me."
A

That certainly is one of the principal issues

inthis ca.se, and in answer to that, Mr.Justice, I believe
there are several facets.
I believe that under the First Amendment the free

j

expression through the mails is a more paramount right, a more
fundamental right within the society.

So, hence, if we must

create a blurring between what has been termed as the “right of
privacy," which I believe you allude to, the answer of

25
6

1

Appellants is that free speech is far more paramount and must

2

override that aspect of the recipient saying, "I do not want,"

3

or "1 have a right not to receive»"
In addition, we submit, however, and I think this is

4

5

more fundamental, that assuming, arguendo, that a recipient

g

does have such a right, this statute goes too far, too fast

7

and, hence we are never met by that issue»

8

is an issue created by the government insuring that riqht of

©

10

privacy is now being polarized with free speech, but I believe
there are too many pitfalls before we arrive at that point.

I submit that this

Do you place this on a higher plane or a more

preferred position than the right to address oral communica­
tions?
A

I don't believe, Mr. Justice, that there are any

planes; I don't believe that there is a ladder within the
First Amendment.

I believe that, each mode of communcation,

as this Court has said, in a sense, spins upon its own
peculiarity or in its own way it must be looked at.

I believe

in this complex, urban society in which we reside the mails
are a very important vehicle.

I do not, in any way, deter­

mine which is a higher form of communcation.

I think communi­

cation is protected by the First Amendment, per se.
Q

Then it. would follow that your clients could

stand outside of the mailbox on the premises and make a speech
and require the occupant to listen to itf if there are no

25

7

1

differences in the planes.

to

ii
12

This particular aspect, again, goes back to the

enunciations that have been made previously: each mode of
ejgprassibn, each form of expression, rather pivots upon its
own.

The situation of standing outside of one's home and

making a speech has the element of a helpless, inescapable
recipient.
Q

There is a little bit of trespass in there?

isn't there?
A

There could well be; there could well be, but

then again, there is always trespass whenever we have speech [
•i

in the sense that there is always someone who does not want to|
!■

13
14

!

hear what the other person says and I suppose that there is a t
trespass in the sound of one's voice or the wave-lengths that
bounce off his ears, but in the society which has preferred

15
free speech, that trespass must give way to the greater right
16
embodied within the constitution.
17
Q

Well, assuming that a citizen does not like

18
certain kinds of literature.

He doesn't want it in his house

19
and is abhorred by just the presence of it in his house.

How

20
can you stop him from finding that literature through his mail
21
slot, in his house?

How can you stop that?

How can you pro­

22
tect his "privacy?'1
23
;v

A

y

Mr. Justice, I believe that inherent in that

24
question would have to be the concession that there is a right
25

8

1

of privacy involved at that juncture.

It is Appellant’s

2

position that unde:: this statute and under that question,

3

there is no right of privacy.

You mean I have no right to keep that type of

paper, literature out of ray house?

merit to give that right, in answer to the question.
Q

19

20
21

£2
23
24
25

into his house?
A

There is only one way that I know, Mr. Justice,

that a citizen may prevent the transmission of third class
mail to his home:, and that’s under a Post Office regulation,
which I believe is 39C.F.R. 44.1.

I believe I am quoting it

correctly.
As far as picking and choosing mail per se, that he
does not want, or, as this statute does in its second aspect,
any mail, regardless of its content, the second mailing,

whether it be political, religious or that tyoe of speech which
has been time-honored by this Court, that a citizen should, not.
have the right to exclude, without determining what the
3

1

content of the material is? because the right of free speech •

2

is greater.
Q

3
4

So, my right — this man's right of privacy is

already gone?
A

5

Is that your position?
Mr. Justice, my position is that under these

0

circumstances, there never has been a right of privacy, or in

7

the alternative, if I must, that right of privacy, under this

8

circumstance* in the face of the statute as drawn, and the

A

X think there are several- aspects to that answer

Pragmatically, X think one of the problems, to be candid, is
that there is a tremendous burden, there was an onerous burden
within this commercial realm of distribution,of removing these
names from lists.

The burden was spelled out in Appellant’s

opening brief, as well as in the amicus brief.
Q

So, really one facet of it it that it is a

financial burden?
A

It is a financial and business burden? that is

only one facet.

Q

I do not believe thatcommercial communica­

That isn’t the point.

1 could accept that for

8

purposes of this discussion, but the value you are protecting

9

is your pocketbook, in terns of not having to take the name

10

off, rather than being able to communicate, because you arenot

11

going to communica ;e anyway with these people, because they

12

just aren’t going ;o accept your communication.
A

13
14

15
18
17

there are several aspects to that.

20
21

22
23
24
25

I think certain aspects —

probably the most troublesome aspect of the statute, I might
add, is the fact that no further mailing of any kind, whatso­
ever may be made by a mailer, regardless of content -Q

18
19

That may well be, but as I rephrased my answer,

Let’s assume that the statute would be eonstruec

to be limited to forbidding only similar mailings of the very
kind that is perfectly obvious that the addressee is not goinc
to read.

He is going to the ashcan with it.
A

If the statute were so construed, in spite of

the fact thatthe legislative history is contrary to that con­
struction, and that was the construction of the court below,
the problem would become, certainly clearer? it would become
12

1

more in the realm of constitutional regulation, but I would

2

then submit to the Court thatany type of regulation of speech

must be carefully scrutinized <md 1 believe this particular

Q

Mr. Taback, I gather you see no relevance of

Valentine and Chrestensen to this problem?
A

Valentine versus Chrestensen gave me a great

deal of trouble, Mr. Justice; however, I justify and I review
the matter in this .fashion:

(!) I think -the subsequent pro­

nouncements of this Court: Times versus Kill, Times versus
Sullivan, have swept the Valentine case aside.
the Valentine case,

On reflection,

1 say, is too broad.

Secondarily, the Valentine case dealt with -—
Q

I thought the Tiirtes and Sullivan opinion — am 1

wrong —made some references to indicate that Valentine and
Chrestensen was not, at least as of that time, disproved.
A

I believe it. did# but it went on to note that

the fact of commercial use in itself will not take speech out
of the First Amendment.
Secondarily, I believe that the Valentine case, like
so many @£ -fell# others

speech regulation cases, dealt with a

situation of the public streets within the confines of local
government.

I think, under these circumstances, the weight

was given to that local regulation, keeping the streets open,
which is as important, in any sense, as that particular* speech
13

;

1

involved.

2

So, I am not, at this point, burdened by Valentine.

3

Q

Do you see a connection between what the court

4

had to say in Ginsberg about the pandering aspect and the

5

limitations here?

6

A

Mr. Justice, I do not? and I do not because of

7

this reason: I believe this Court in the Ginsberg case, ad­

8

dressed itself to a completely different problem and that was

9

the problem of whether the advertisement connected with the

10

actual material could be used as evidence in determining whether

11

the material itself was obscene.

12

one, dr in the words of several of the Justices on this Court,

S3

said that possibly p<mdering statutes would be created if they

14

were not ambiguous.

15

very difficult item by which to regulate and a very troublesome

16

one.

The connection, if I do find

The allusion to the fact that it would be a

But, again, the defining of pandering within that
confine, as it was done, 1 feel, related only to the ultimate
issue of whether that material for the first time, could be usee
in discerning and determining whether the material itself, was
obscene.
Q

Do you think Congress' would have been inhibited

23

inany way 'from passing a statute that, upon the request of a

24

householder, no mailman could set foot on, or could put any mail

25

into the box or on the premises of the householder?
14

He said,

1

"I don’t want the mailman here.

2

a constitutional objection?

3
4

3

6

7
8

13

14

Q

Well, what is it?

I believe, again, that by being a citizen within
■
i
this society, he subjects himself to communication from certain j
ordinary living aspects.

The mail is so basic and so critical

that th&t mail must be delivered.
Q

But assume he does not read it, even if he

doesn’t want it?
A

11
12

Yes, I do.

Do you see

A

Just cut me off.”

crux.

Receiving it, per* se, in his hands, is not the

Reading it is the problem.

He always has that free

choice, unfettered, to throw it in the ashcan.

To keep

the
i

mailman away is to close this individual off, to create the
situation where communication would be clogged.

15
a

16

Well, then, it would follow that if you put a

high wall and a bunch of very disagreeable dogs out to keep
17

people away, somehow or other the householder would be violating
18
19

the First Amendment right of all the potential mailers.
'

A

No, Mr. Justice, I do not submit to that,

What

20
we have here is if the householder chooses to take his individual
21

action, he may, but here we have a government intervening, the

22
government issuing a prohibitory order and mandatory language
23

that no further mciii, regardless of content, shall be forwarded.
24

Q

Then you mean 1 can violate your client’s First

25
15

1

Amendment rights but the government;, as a whole, cannot; I, as

However, interaction between individual citizens may

Q

7

What you say is, I gather, that governmental

8

action cannot assist an individual from exposing himself to any

9

mail that anybody wants to send him?
A

10

No, Mr. Justice Harlan* vVhafc X am saying is

11

that when governmental action involves itself, and certainly to

12

the degree of quantum necessary, we have a different Tiiatter.

X am certain that

the government can, certainly constitutionally, but when it
does the escape hatch that is individual action, personal action,
is closed.

We now have a governmental intrusion.

It must be

viewed far differently than citizen against citizen.
Q

Well, that's what I'm saying.

X thought that

was your position.
A

I bag your pardon, Mr. Justice.

Q

The government can assist as far as this kind of

thing is concerned, a man who wants to protect himself against
mail that he doesn't want to receive.
A

To this point I disagree, Mr. Justice, for the

following reasons:

It is the government that issues the

prohibitory order.

cannot be done.

matter, clearly demonstrated that they wanted no administrative

in fact, within the statute they eliminated judicial review and
they removed the latter from the Administrative Procedure Act.

Are you suggesting the American Bar Association

The Amreican Bar Association took a primary and,

I believe, singular position, only with rega^.- to the procedural

Let us determine whether he has acted in good faith*
This flies in the face of the governmental or legisla-

tive history and intent*
Time is fleeting*

At this juncture I merely wish to

comment and point to the Court that the procedures embodied in
the hearing that is involved in this statute, falls a far dis­
tance from the Fifth Amendment*

There is 210 right to confront

your complainant; there is no adversary procedure and constitu­
tional issues cannot be raised*

I have attempted on numerous

occasions — it is the subject of an affidavit within the appen­
15
16

dix, starting at page 22 — and all affidavits in the record
below were uncontroverted*

Nothing was forwarded; nothing

-ame

17

in contravention to those affidavits.

19

One comment:

the amicus brief of the Direct Mail

Advertising Association clearly said that unless you can inter­
20

pret this matter our way, which is namely, the finding or ad­
21

ministrative procedure ex parte, if you will, that the material
22
is pandering, the law is too broad, it is too sweeping.

The

23

court below, quote:

Judge Hoffstadler said, "We can only

24

salvage this statute by meticulously construing it and shrinking
25
19

1

it down to constitutional size," and the interpretation given bj

2

that court below, "in salvaging," is contrary to the position

3

taken by the government, contrary to the legislative history and

4

hence, it must fall»

5

It is contrary to the Appellants,

It was clearly the view of Congress that this matter

6

be a subjective determination, unfettered and uncontrolled, and

7

inthe face of the First Amendment, this cannot go in that

8

fashion.

9

The right cf privacy — one last note on that ----- has

10

always or more traditionally involved the government attempting

It

to discover something about someone else.

12

here; we have merely an envelope going to someone.

13

We do not have this

I call to tie Court's attention, Exhibit B attached to

14

the affidavit found at page 22 of the appendix, which, entered

15

into evidence and was uncontroverted, a notice to recipient that

16

"If you do not x^ant tills, just hand it back to your Postmaster."

17

This is what has been done and yet the statute went far afield

18

and found it necessary to build in a contempt proceeding,

19 [ultimate jail sentence: if necessary, and we say, taking the
20

entire matter together like its, if you will, sister statutes,

21

40008, 40006, is as unconstitutional as those prior statutes.
Thank you.
Q

Well, one problem I have is that you said a

minute ago it would be very expensive to take the names off the
list and you now say that you invite the people to send it back
20

i

so that you can take the

a method by which it can be taken off

the list at a more reduced cost and this is what we mean, Mr.

Justice.

a better chance of doing it, because the label usually in com­

6

mercial distribution, has a code.

7

not alphabetised? there is no way to go through the As or Bs.

But you want to put the burden on the taxpayer,

the recipient, to walk to the garbage pail or whatever to dis­

22

you have 200,000 people on your mailing list, isn’t it?

23

A

Collectively, that burden is a large burden if

I don't believe that it is a burden that is

24

unwarranted.

I think we are dealing with a First Amendment

right and if that be a burden, the shift of the burden should be

the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

Since, at the outset there seems to be some concern

about just precisely what the Government's position is, either
below or in our motion to affirm or in our brief, let me make it
perfectly clear precisely what the government's position is.
It is our position that Congress has said when an
individual in our society receives through the mail, material
which 1 his sole discretion ha believes to be a pandering ad­
vertisement and he again find in his sole discretion, this
material to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative, he
can tell the sender "Don’t send me any more material, period,"
and the addresse enlists the support of the Post Office in in­
forming the sender of his desire.

And if the

And if the sender persists after one prohibiting order
from the Post Office, he may be enjoined from continuing to send
the material to an ur,willing recipient.

If he still persists he

may be held in contempt by the court which has issued the injunc
tion, for violating the court's order.

We believe that Congress has sought to protect a man

in his own home.

legislative history »--

Q

Congress knew, I think it is clear, from the

Excuse me, Mr., Ruckelshaus.

Does the statute

5

reach any addressee or only one's home?

That is, would it reach,

6

for example, mail addressed to a business establishment?

7

A

Yes,

I take it it would, Mr. Justice, although—

8

Q

Any addressee at all?

G

A

Yes.

10

Q

Youdcn't see any difficulty

11

A

Well, I would take it thatthe

alternative to

12

attempting to limit this to a man's home would be extremely

13

difficult, if not being easily discernible where a man would

14

live, for instance, cr where could object to this kind of thing

15

or anything coming into his home.

16

We think that the purpose of the statute, obviously,

n

was to protect the man in his own home and if there was language

18

in the statute which extended that purpose, it was necessary in

19

the circumstances.

20

Q

Well, I take it then that something just ad­

21

dressed to General Motors Corporation, Detroit, Michigan, if

22

General Motors didn’t want to receive it, it’s not addressed to

23

an individual, just the General Motors Corporation, this statute

24

would apply.

25

A

I, under the broadest possible interpretation, I
23

1

assume that it could.

2

vidual,, although if you send it, the statute itself said if

3

you send it to an address listed only "to occupant," that that

4

is a violation of a prohibitory order, against that address.

I imagine the same thing would apply.

Q

Mr. Ruckelshaui;, does this statute cover obscene
%
or alleged obscene material that doesn't carry with it any ad­
vertising content?

Supposing some outfit just sends dirty

pictures through the mails?
A

No, it has to be a pandering advertisement, Mr.

Justice; the statute is clear on that. I think.

The advertising

nature of the material is nought to be controlled here.
Q

I suppose if it carried

the publisher's name

even without more on the dirty picture, why you might be able to
infer advertising.
A

Yes, you might.

I take it there would be some

gray area as to precisely what an advertisement was.
Q

But, it does cover only advertisements?

A

Yes, that's right.

Q

And it is terms of only pandering advertisement

■v" "'v .

which the addressee believes to be erotically arousing or
sexually provocative, but as I understand it, your point is

24

1

that and your construction of the statute is that if the

2

addressee, John Smith, thinks that an advertisement from a

3

furniture store is erotic or sexually arousing, he car?, prevent

4

any further mailings to him from that furniture store, in his

5

absolute and unfettered discretion? is that correct?

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, he can notify the post office

although he would be

himself in violation of the obvious intent

of the statute, nevertheless —
Q

X thought the obvious intent of the statute was

to make him the sole judge.
A

Yes, but assuming again, that it had some rela­

tion to the pandering advertisement, as far as the individual
was concerned.

I thrnk that given the purpose of the statute,

which was dual? Number one, to leave it in his discretion, as to
what he should refuse to receive, and, secondly, to get the
Administrative Branch and the courts out of the business of
determining whether he was rational in that exercise, it’s
necessary for him to also be able to say, "This is in my own
home; as far as I am concerned, I don*t want to receive this?
it’s erotically arousing."
Q

And T don't want to receive any further mailings

21

22

from this center.
A

Yes; that's right.

Q

Of whatever nature.

Q

Well, that means if a Safeway store sends to my

23
24
25
25

1

home an advertisement: "We’re selling Maine potatoes this week

2

at 50 cents a peck."

3

is quite meaningless, because if, in my subjective judgment it's

4

erotically arousing.

S

my request to Safeway not to deliver any snore advertisements fox

6

Maine potatoes to my house? is that right?
A

8
9

14
15
16

Q

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Well, then what’s the significance of the pander­

ing language in the statute?
A

Well, I think the significance is that this

language is, as evidenced by the pamphlet that the Post Office
itself has put out, the language was to tell the individual,
"This is what we’re trying to give you a chance to refuse to
receive in your home."
Q

17
!8

That is the interpretation which I think must

intent.

12

!3

The Post Office has to issue an order at

be given to the statute, given the Congressional history and

10
11

The language of pandering in the statute

But, if the Post Office can't say to me, well,

"An advertisement by Safeway to sell Maine potatoes is not some­
thing under the statute that you can refuse to receive, or at
least require us to tell Safeway not to send to your home any
more.
A

If the Post Office could make such a determina­

tion we submit that it would frustrate the second purpose of
Congress, which was to get the Post Office out of the business of
censorship.
26

Q

1

Well, again, what possible significance does the

attempted limitation to pandering advertisements have?

2

A

3

Well, I think, Mr. Justice, it was to tell the

4

individual in his own home that this is what Congress intended,

S

was to allow you to get pandering materials out of your home,

6

and in spite of the Direct Mail Advertisers in its amicus brief,

7

there is nothing before this Court that the purpose of the
statute is being widely abused by individuals in their home.

8

We have, as we have noted in our brief, some 368,000

3

complaints,in the Post Office.

10

At the Justice Department, at

the end of last month, we had filed some 2,100 complaints.

11

We

have not filed any complaints in an effort to enforce the

12

prohibitory order that don't have anything to do with some sexual-

13

orientation .

14

Now, I think what Congress was recognizing, that if

IS

they are going to get the courts and the administrative branch

16

out they have to give this discretion to the individual,

even

17
to be unreasonable, in his own home.

18

Q

19

Well, Mr. Attorney General, I take it you would

be making the same argument if Congress had passed a statute

20

that said,

"Anybody who wants to stop any mail being sent from

21

anyone, can do so."

22
A

There is a regulation that the Post Office now

23
has which, in a footnote to the Lament case, and inthe regulation
24
itself, has been so interpreted that an individual could notify
23
27
i

1

the Post Office and say, "I don't want to receive any jnore mail,

z

period.”

3

Q

Well, I know, but let's assume this statute,

4

instead of having a 'limitation on it concerning pandering ad­

S

vertisement, just simply said that this procedure was available

6

whenever an addressee of mail didn't want to receive any more

7

mail from that sender»

8

A

9

difficulty with that»

10

Q

Isn't that the same argument —

11

A

Precisely the same argument,

I don't thirds there would be any constitutional

I think that the

12

reason thatthe pandering advertisement is in. the statute, even

13

in this context, is to notify the individual.

14

meant, and not to have the individual use his powers to prohibit

15

somebody from coming in his home and communicating with him,

16

indiscriminately and unreasonably.

This is what we

And that really what we have

i

17

here is very analogous to the right that an individual has to

18

turn off the television set, turn off the radio if he's listen­

19

Do you think a person has a right to read or

I think he has that right.

It's a First Amendment right; isn’t it?

Well, the right — certainly the right to see

20

the right to receive

there is a corrollary of its the right not to receive.

Well, there may not be,

I don't think you'’need

to ■— I suggest that perhaps you don *fc need go so far as to imply
that there is any Federal right, any constitutional general
right to be let alone.

That, generally, is considered to be

i right recognized toy the Law of Torts, andprotected by state
law, like other property rights.

But, all you need do, the

only Federal right involved here I should think, in this aspect
of your case, is the First Amendment right, the right of choice
and the right of choosing what a person wants to see or what he
wants to hear and it also involves his right to close his eyes
or to stop up his ears; isn’t that about it?
A

That’s —■ I think that that certainly is a

corollary to the right to receive whatever you want to,
Q

Yes, the right to choose what you want to read

or what you want to see, involves the right to say, "I don’t
want to see it? I don’t want to even see what it is,"
Q

Of course, that's counter to a big chapter in

American history involving compulsory public school attendence.
A

I think that the compulsory public school atten­

dance, Mr, Justice, is not necessarily —

door, shutting your eyes, shutting your ears off and just be­

23

tion?

25

A

I think that where we're dealing with these kinds

of right we have to be careful to delineate each one we're
31

1

2
3
4

discussing»

In this instande, I think clearly the right to

receive has the corollary of the right to turn off unwanted
material and that's what we're talking about inthis statute.
Q

Mr. Attorney General, is there any — going back

5

to Mr. Justice Douglas's point, is there any Federal authority

S

that can make anybody go to school anywhere, any time?

7

A

No --

8

Q

It's a matter of state.

9

A

That's right, Mr. Justice, it's the states which

10
11

have laws that provide that up to the age of 16 -—
Q

And I suppose some states might say you have to

12

go to school until you are 12 and others might say 14 and others

13

might say some other age.

14

A

Yes? that is, there is no constitutional right

15

that -- constitutional mandate that people have to go to school

16

up until a certain age.

17

Q

And we’ve never found, so far as I know, have

18

we, any Federal constitutional barrier to a state's requiring

19

the students to go and listen, as Mr. Justice Douglas suggested?

3

ing a caveat on this big, general principle you are trying to

get us to embrae©»
A

5

6
7
8

9

IO

Well, I think that the principle itself has to be

delineated on a case-by-case basis, but 1 think the principle
itself, as suggested in the amicus brief, that the right to
privacy is only the right to control knowledge about one's self
is and will become a considerably broader concept, than the way
they would attempt to limit it in that case*
Now, as far as the First Amendment provision itself

1?
12

13
14

15
16

is concerned, I think that we have a basic distinction in what
Congress sought to do in this statute and the exercise of First
Amendment rights that have been upheld in previous mail cases
and previous cases in this Court, and that is that here, where
an individual decide 5 he wants no further communication from a
mailer, his decision affects only himself, and 1 think this is

17
the prism through wh:.eh the First Amendment claim has to be
18
19

viewed*
In all other cases when an individual or an agency

20
or governmental unit decided that they did not like what was
21

being communicated, their attempt to stop the communication did

22
not affect even a single individual or the majority; it. affected
23
everyone.

And there is a great distinction between this case

24
and those kinds of cases.

We6re not talking about a case where

25
33

1

the Postmaster General would say, "You can’t send any more mail

2

— any more of this kind of material or magazines or books

S

through the mail to anyone.

4

in the society has told me, "I don’t want to be communicated

S

from the sender any nore and he is notifying the sender of that

6

individual's desire, which has nothing to do with the sender’s

7

right to communicate to everyone else in the society.

8
9

He's simply saying, this, indi vidua],

If yo\’A're talking about a chill on First Amendment
rights, there is no evidence inthis case that anyone else has

desire, nor is there any evidence that there is any change in

1Z

the material that is being sent out, that it is precisely the

13

same kind of thing tlat is being distributed.

14
15

And I think, by the same token, in the Bantam Books
case, where we had a censorship board and what the censorship

16

board did to the individual book distributors in Rhode Island

17

is not the same situation as we have here, because it then

18

affected everyone, arc! here it only affects an individual.

19

And I think the reason for the difficulties in other

20

cases is that the decision of the majority or a single man,

21

could affect what every man wanted to receive and that situation

22

does not happen here.

23

turning off speech and as has been suggested, I think that the

24

right to receive has the corollary right of not to receive.

were concerned, about the sensibilities of the addressee and

Well, there is a very, great big difference

between turning off the radio or television and writing to some
sender of mail and saying, "Please never send me anything again,
ever, through the mail, and this statute, because in the first
example, government is not implicated, whatsoever.

This is

purely an individual, personal action, the exercise of free
choice.

Here the Government of the United States is implicated

and that is the only reason this case is hare.
A

I think that’s right, but the only reason the

Government is not implicated as a censor, or as an inhibitor or
prohibitor of First Amendment rights; they are implicated simply
because this is the only way it can be turned off.
35

1

And what Congress has done, in implicating Government,

2

and I agree that that's really why it is here,, is simply to use

3

them as the hand that turns off the radio and the television,

4

Q

The other difference is that you turned the

In this case you didn9t turn that mail, he turned

cry about having to pay to turn it off,,

mailed it.
A

I see your point, Mr. Justice and I think it

12

was Congress's point that the cost involved is simply a recog­

13

nition that he has to give to the sensibilities of the recipients.

14

And I don't believe that that should render this statute with

15

any constitutional difficulty.

16

Q

Is there anything in this record about the

17

sender's having a pattern of sending some of his materials to

IS

11 or 12-year-old, seventh and eighth grade people, so as to

19

be able to get an outlet in the schools?

20

A

There is a great deal of testimony to that

21

effect in the Congressional Record and in the legislative his­

22

tory of this statute,

This is obviously what Congress was

23

attempting to get at.

There is no evidence in this record that

the Direct Mail Order; as Congressman Waldie, I think, said on

the Floor of the House, the man who gave the shape to this

present statute, he said,, "I am the Supreme Court in the par­

3

ticular household in which my children reside, and from my

decision there is no appeal»"

5

Congress was attempting to do, to say that a man inhis own home

can refuse to receive material because it might have a deleter-

ious effect on his children, as far as he v?as concerned, and

I think that’s what Section A of the statute

2

says*. Mr. Justice,

It also says in Section C of the statute:

3

"The order of the Postmaster General shall expressly prohibit

4

the sender and his agents or assigns, from making any further

5

mailing to the designated addressee."

6

Q

What kind of mailing?

7

A

Any mailings, whatsoever, Mr. Justice.

They are forbidden to send anything to him.

Q

To assign to the Postmaster General the duty

to

define what was pandering, and I would have great difficult,
msyelf.
A

Yes, and I think the Postmaster General is

equally concerned about that, about having that onus upon his
shoulders and in the administrative pamphlet which has been put
out and the order that he sends out, he sees this statute as.,
being precisely what Congress itself saw it as meaning, and that
is that he had no discretion to determine what was, and what was
not pandering.
Q

I wonder why, if they wanted to just enable the

householder to keep any company from sending something, it just
didn’t say that.
38

1

A

BecaTxse I don't think that's what they meant.

Q

Why did it get mixed up with pandering?

him the power to deteirmine what was and what was not pandering.
A

Well;

I think if you read Section A as having

pandering advertisements being modified also by E!in his sole
discretion," in a way in which it can be read, it is clear that
this is what Congress; intended.

The legislative history shows

that it's clear that this is what Congress intended.
Q

If they hadn't attempted to define it by

"pandering," and had left it that he could decide what company
should send him mail, I could under-stand it better.
A

Well, I think the reason they did not want to

do that was because there is a lot of controversy within Cong­
ress overthe merits or demerits of so-called "junk mail."
Q

And it's junk mail for the sender.

As I under­

stand it the theory is that the sender, the recipient has the
right to determine whether he wants it or not and so why not let
him determine it and just say that he can’t get any more mail
from those people?

hhy do they mix it up with the definition of

Postmaster General had was to decide whether there had been a
xnailing that was objected to by an addresses that was an adver­

same sender, even though it might not be pandering on the second
or third or tenth, or hundredth mailing?
A

That’s right, Mr. Justice, because the alterna­

tive was to make the sender decide what was pandering, have that
decision reviewed by the Administrative Branch and then again
reviewed by the courts, and Congress saw that as getting us righ
back into the problem that existed before.
Q

Well, Mr,, Ruckelshaus, you do concede, or do

you, that the Postmaster has to decide before he issues an order
that the material is an advertisement?
A

Yes.

Q

X know, but do you concede that he does . have to

decide that?

I think he can decide that very easily.

He has no authority to order anybody not to mail,

based on a nonadvertiseraent mailing.
A

No.

X think the statute —■

Q

Well,, I know, but here you have two words:

"pandering advertisement," and you say the Postmaster General

41

cannot issue an order unless it's an advertisement, and so he

2

has to decide inhis own mind whether it's an advertisement.

3

Now, where do you get ~ on what do you base your

4

argument that while he can decide what's an advertisement, he

3

has no authority to decide what's a pandering advertisement?
A

6

Well, I think, because of the obvious difficul­

7

ties in deciding what is pandering and what isn't, and the more

3

objective standard thatcan be used in deciding what is an adver­

tisement.

statute says, is "any further mailings."
Q

He must base it then, just on the legislative

Now, let's assume that the Postmaster General

issues the order? there are further mailings of the same kind,
or just any further mailing, and he goes into court for an
order.

A

Well, he's authorised to request the Attorney

General, who is —
Q

All right, the Attorney General goes into the

court for an order arid on that hearing for an order to stop
mailing it's clearly proved,

end.
Q

In terms of literature it might not be way off

on one end.
A

Well», I think if there was an abuse of an --

an obvious abuse of e. lower court’s decision in issuing, which
is basically an equitable proceeding, an injunction, that there
might be some grounds for appeal from that decision, but I
we had used the standard in our brief as the suggested standard
of a good faith standard.

Any standard that you use you have

difficulty with, because how can you determine good faith if
the addressee is not present in court, and he may well not be
present in court, if he’s at the other end of the country.
So that I think that to the extent that the court
would receive one of these things that obviously was an adver­
tisement; it had no relation whatsoever to pandering or sexually

15
16

oriented material, that a court could, in its equity power,
refuse to exercise its discretion in entering an order.

Just as

17
the Attorney General, where it says he’s authorized to bring
18
such a case and where it says in the second stage the Postmaster
19
General is authorized torequest the Attorney General —
20

C

But I take it that you would say that the Dis­

21
trict Court, when it?s asked to enter that order, when it looked
22
at that advertisement it could issue the injunction in its dis­
23
cretion and you're saying that the statute, apparently will
24
authorize the District Court to issue thatinjunction and that it
25
44

1

would be no violation of the statute to order a person to quit

2

sending potato advertisements..
A

3

I dorft think that we need go that far.

4

it may well be if its potatoes that the court, on appeal, could

5

be said to have abused its discretion.
