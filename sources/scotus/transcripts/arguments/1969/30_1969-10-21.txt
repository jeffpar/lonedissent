ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN C. AMAKER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

7

MR. AMAKER;

9

the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case arising from Greene County, Alabama, is

13

on appeal from a three-judge Court from the Northern District

n
n

of Alabama.

13

day’s session, concerning Georgia's jury selection law, the

14

issue posed is thatof the Constitutional validity under the

15

14th Amendment of Alabama’s statute which vests successive

is

discretion in jury officials in that state in the selection of

17

jurors.

Like the Turner case showed at the close of yesterI

Our submission is that the use of statutes such as

18

13

these in those states like Alabama, which have a demonstrated

20

history of discrimination against black people in the jury

21

selection process, is the major cause of the continual

22

phenomenon of the racial exclusion of blacks from the oppor­

23

tunity for jury service in state courts.

24

which is all too commonplace, as this Court’s experience in

25

jury

That’s a phenomenon

discrimination''cases for the past 90 years attests.

2

I

Q

Suppose we didn't have this past history of

z

discrimination, would you still say the statute was unconsti­

3

tutional?

4

A

If you didn't have that history of discrimina­

5

tion I would say that the statute is susceptible of abuse, and

S

therefore if a different kind of demonstrated injury were

1

made to appear, that the Court would have to hold the statute

3

unconstitutional.

9

Q

Well, let me sharpen the question, then.

1C

Supposing there was no evidence, that it had been affirmatively

n

demonstrated that there was no history of discrimination,

!2

what would you say about the statute?

13

A

I would say that the statute is vague, and

14

lacking in standards and susceptible of abuse,

'15

that the Court would not — the issue of whether the statute

IS

was constitutional would not be present because there would be

17

no history of the application of the vague standards to a

13

situation in which one could demonstrate that constitutional

19

rights had been violated.

£0

That's not this case.

I would say

All of the vagueness cases in

this Court; free expression area and the criminal area, are
cases in which some litigant came to the Court and said that
because of the vague standards which give excessive- discretion
to officials, ray constitutional rights.have been violated.
\

Until a case of that kind reaches this Court and it reaches

3

i

this Court in this case and in Georgia and it has not, as for

2

example, Wisconsin or Maine, the kinds of questions we were

3

discussing yesterday, the Court obviously has no occasion to

4

declare the unconstitutionality of the statute.

5

been the consistent pattern of litigation and decision-making

S

in this Court.
Q

7
B

But that has

Then it is the statute as applied that you

think is the complaint; isn't it?
A

9

Only in the very narrow sense.

If what, you

10

are talking about is the manner in which the jury officials

u

have used their discretion, which is what the issue here is

12

concerned about ■— now, that’s a different question from the

t
I

13

way the District Court addressed the question.

U

said: "If we issiie an injunction which tells these jury

IS

officials that they are no longer to discriminate, that's

IS

sufficient."

27

of discretion; that does not deal with the capability for

!3

discrimination that the statute invites, and therefore the

19

only way that you can deal with that is to deal with the

20

source of the problem which is a statutory'’ standard itself.

21

That's exactly what this Court did in some of the cases that we

22

cited in our brief involving discrimination against Blacks in

23

voting.

24

cases that have come before it.

25

They simply
I

Well, I say that does not deal with the problem

That’s what this Court, has done in all the vagueness

doctrine in this Court.

4

This is by now, no novel

1

Now, in challenging this —• in this case, therefore,

2

Alabama’s jury selection statutes, I stress at the outset, the

3

firm belief that this long-standing problem of racial dis­

4

crimination in jury selection will not be solved, unless the

3

Court will respond to this challenge by voiding the provisions

6

of the statute involved here and requiring the use of fairly-

7

administered, objective standards for determining what persons

a

shall be listed on the rolls of the prospective jurors of the

9

state.

10

Q

What would you consider as objective standards?

it

A

One suggestion — X think it’s exemplary only,

n

of the kind that the Congress enated in dealing with this

13

same problem in the context of a Federal jury selection system.

14

After' the key-man system had been exposed as an apparatus

13

whereby discrimination would be practiced against groups and

IS

the groups involved there were principally Negroes, in the

17

Fc -eral system, the Congress responded to that challenge by

18

enacting the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968.
Q

19
20

those same standards for the selection of state jurors?
A

21

22
23
24
23

M I right that Congress was asked to enact

It — there were two bills.

They were both part

package.

Now, the bill with"respect to Federal juryselection

was taken out and enacted last year.
posed in 1966 passed the House.

5

The bill that was pro-

Nov;, there was in that bill,

t

Section 203,

{a) and (b), which together gave to the District

2

Courts the judgment of whether they could require objective

3

criteria in the state jury selection process.

4

pretty clear that there were thoughts --

So, it is

Q

Did that bill suggest what the criteria would

A

The Federal Act does and the —

3

Q

I mean the one was related to the selection of

9

juries in the states.

10

A

5
6

be?

So far as I know, Mr. Justice Brennan, it did

li

not state what they should be.

The Federal Act stated the

12

very simple ones of age, residency, absence of a felony

13

conviction, and the simple ability to read and write the

n

English language, as determined -- again objectively, not

15

subjectively, as determined by a person's ability to fill out

16

17
13
19

a juror qualification form.
Now, that is the system that is, in fact, in ope.ra­
tion throughout the Federal system.

As I indicated in my reply

brief in this case, District Courts throughout the country,
t

20

21

22
23
24
25

who have been faced with suits of the kind that this is, an
affirmative action suit injunctively, have directed or

*

suggested to state officials that they ought to take a look at
what the Congress did 'with respect to that Federa7 statute, as
a means of remedying the problem.
What that means to me is that it is pretty clear

6

1

that 90 years of litigation and the repeated admonition to

2

jury officials that they must reform their system, really

3

hasn't worked.

4

essenfcic^l step is to deal with the source of the problem,

S

which is the discretion-vesting statutes like the one involved

s

in this case.
Q

7

And the only kind of reform that is an

Do you think that's the source of the problem

3

or do you think the source of the problem is simply an unre­

9

constructed intention to discriminate on the basis of those

10

who were given the job of picking juries?
A

11

Well, it's pretty clear, Mr. Justice Stewart,

12

that that's true, but the question that you have to ask is

13

what can you do? what can you deal with? what can a Court

14

deal with? how do you remedy the problem?

13

it's possible for this or any other Court to remedy that

13

problem by an injunction t^hich says, "Administer the statute

17

fairly."

18

What it can do consistent with the decisions of this Court

19

under the vagueness doctrine, is to deal with the state en­

20

actment which permits those unreconstructed attitudes to be

21

effective.

22

I don’t think that

The Court has done that consistently for 90 years.

Q

Now, in this case, and I am just looking at a

23

paragraph in your own brief on Page 10, in which you summarise

24

the injunction that wag granted.

25

exclusion of Negroes from the jury rolls of Greene County and

7

"It was against systematic

i

also an order requiring that a new jury roll showing the race,

2

and, if available, the age of each juror be filed with the

3

Court within 60 days and a report showing the procedure used

4

in compiling it."
Now, isn't that the way to get at this, rather than,

S
6

to excise a couple of adjectives from the statute?
A

?

No; that isn't the way to get at it.

If that

8

were the way to get at it, Mr. Justice Stewart, you would not

9

have the. constant reappearance of these jury discrimination

10

cases in this Court and in courts throughout the nation, and

n

when I am talking about the nation, I am talking about the

courts in that southern tier of states where the problem has
persisted.

And just excising the language isn't effective.

What you have to do is to require that there be objective
standards.

It doesn't strike me that that is such a tremen­

dous problem.

There are 22 states, to be sure, which have

similar language —
8

You mean that we should write the —

A

Oh, I don't think so; I think that the Court

can say — one of the District Judges in one of thecases we
diited here, simply said, "We suggest to you that you use
objective criteria and to help you, we refer you to what the
Congress did in the selection of jury — in the Jury Selection
Service Act." 1 don't think that there would be really anything

25

8

1

wrong with the Court indicating what kind of objective

2

criteria would be desirable,,

3

the Court to indicate that there must be some kind of objec­

4

tive criteria.

But I think ites important for

Of the States in in Union* though there may be 22

5

s

which have this kind of vague language* you can document that

7

in a number of them it has been used and employed for a dis­

3

criminatory purpose and that's why the case is here* but that

9

still leaves a majority of the states that have not found it

10

necessary to operate a fair jury selection system by using

II

language of this sort.

12

My own submission is that when you have language of

13

this sort and you put that you give the discretion to persons

14

who are reconstructed in their attitudes and who are also

15

white, in a community like Greene County where you have a

15

shown on this record; and those results have been documented

If, by

The question, it seems to me is really not how many

15

states are or are not employing language of this kind, it's

16

the abuse-creating mechanism that language of this kind gives.

n

And again, I will resort to what this Court has done in the

13

vagueness cases traditionally.

20

cases that we have cited here.

That's exactly what was done

Thera is a second issue that's presented here, and

22

that is whether the District Court in this case and on this

23

record should be upheld in refusing what we think is an

24

essential^element of relief to which Appellants are entitled

A

Right.

11

Q

And what’s your suggestion as to the remedy that

12

should be accorded in the event that we agreed with you on the

13

merits at this point?

14

A

Well, I start from the proposition that the

15

District Court had a record of discriminatory action over a

1<3

long period of time taken by jury officials, all of whom are

17

white.

13

I look at the statement in Louisiana v United States,

13

which indicates that the District Court when dealing with this

20

problem of racial discrimination, has the duty to render a

21

22
23

decree that will give effectiverelief.

Mow, it is true that

on our first submission an essential, first step is to get rid
of the vague standards and to require objective criteria.

But

24

it is also pretty clear that there may well be a time lag

25

between the time that that relief becomes effective and that

11

1

in any event,, there is a practical impossibility to excise

2

all discretion from the administration of laws.

3

basis, then, it seems to me that in a community, the vast

4

majority of whose citizens are black, where you can demon­

5

strate that white officials have consistently discriminated,

6

and there is no easier demonstration to make than on this

7

record, that as an essential item of relief, the District

S

Court in order to give the complete relief to which the

§

parties here are entitled, should have required the appoint­

to

ment of some black members to the jury commission.
Q

11
12

As I understand, Mr, Araaker, there are three

jury commissioners in each county?

That is correct,,

And your suggestion is that the Governor of the

state should be required to appoint what, at least one of the

20

appoint jury commissioners which reflect so far as possible

What the Court has before it is the situation in Greene

could perhaps even order an election and in a county like

years, it is very probable»
Q

invalidate the state law that confers upon the Governor the

power to appoint jury commissioners»

Are you suggesting that?

A

n

Well# I'm simply saying that the course of

13

conduct of all white jury commissions in this county has

14

already violated the Constitution, and -therefore, as a matter

IS

of relief, I see nothing wrong with the District Court stating

18

that in order to cope with that we are going to require you,

17

in this county at least, to appoint commissions in & different

way.

which the Court deemed the parties were entitled.
Q

Well, then, you are suggesting that at least in

respect to Green® County, the law of Alabama that confers upon

13

1

the Governor the power and the duty to appoint jury commis­

2

sioners is invalid?

3

A

That's right.

That was the claim of the

4

District Court and that is the claim that we urge here.

3

There is another point which I think I should

6

address myself to.

That is the District Court’s view in its

7

Opinion that it could not void the vague statutory standards

3

because this Court had never held this criteria to be void for

3

vagueness.

And it cited for that proposition, Cassell versus

10

Texas, which is one of a group of five cases

involving the

11

Texas Grand Jury system from

12

1940 to 1954.

of the thing to say that Greene County can do this and that,

22

couldn't that apply to all 57 counties; I don’t know?

23

only thing I know is to cite the Swain case and Mr. Justice

..24

White wrote the opinion in the case, that there has to be a

23

broad representation? isn’t that correct, sir?

17

But the

1

Q

You may be correct»

a

A

Yes.

3

Q

I suppose an answer to the Chief Justice8s

4

question is that the way to get at it is.the way that this

S

District Court got at it.

6

that there had been a declaratory judgment put down in 1967

7

and that that had not remedied the situation that they had

8

continued to be recalcitrant and that now the time had come

©

for an injunction and this Court issued an injunction which

This Court in its Opinion, said

10

was specific and stringent, and I suppose your answer is that

ii

the way to get at it is the way the District Court got at it,

12

rather than to enjoin the Governor of the State as to who

13

should be appointed as jury commissioners.

14

answer?

15
16
17
18

A

Isn't that the

I would feel that way; yes, sir,

I don't think

this Court has the power to do it.
Q

Do what?
j

A

To issue an injunction to the Governor of the
.

19

State of Alabama to tell him to appoint one Nigra, two Nigras

20

— black people? pardon me, or three on the commission.

21
22

23
24
25

Q

Certainly the Federal Court not only has the

power but the duty, doesn't it, under the Constitution, the
14th AMendraenfc of the Constitution, to see to it that there is
no racial discrimination in the selection of jurors in Greene
County or any other county in any State of the Union?

18

A

i

1 think it9 s quite clear that

Yessir.

2

Alabama declares it has a situation, but we haven3t thoroughly

3

solved it.
Q

4

Well, do you think that the Order which has now

5

been entered by the District Judge will produce a solution

8

that's a reasonable one?
A

7

Well, we've got three very competent judges

8

down there, and I think that it probably will solve it.

I

§

don’t know why they are appealing that portion of it anyway.

10

The only thing I wonder about is why they are appealing from

11

the other point.

Why they what?

ment?

I didn't get that.

The only thing you wondered about was why
A

Well, I was wondering why they appealed from

the — they got a favorable decision in the first part of it
and now they want us to just change the whole situation and
have a court decree that the Governor has got to do this, that
and the other and I don’t thin]-: so.
Q

It's probably not in the reoord, but what’s

happened in relation to the remedying of the situation since
this decree was issued$ can you tell me?

In your county.

Are there more Negroes on the jury list?
A

Yes, siri considerably more.

19

In fact, I tried

i

a case over there not too long ago in connection with the

2

District Attorney and there were now turned up more Nigras

3

them they were whites.

4

Q

Has this injunction been complied with — I'm

S

referring to the language appearing on 21-A of the jurisdic­

6

tional statesmen which said: "Defendants are ordered to take

7

prompt action to compile a jury list for Greene County,

Now, has

that been done?

Yes, sir.

That, of course, wouldn't be in the record?

It wouldn't be in the

Thereis no appeal onthat?

Prior to that injunction there

Q

Eight.

In according to this injunction to meet

this problem.
A

But I understand that was the same thing that

24

Congress did, you know, in the Jury Act and-1 in both the juries

25

because the problem we have had in these racial discrimination

21

?

cases over the years, Mr. Justice Stewart, is that you haven't

2

bean able to find out very often. — you have been able to.

3

but not without a considerable amount of difficulty, what the

racial breakdown was.

May I ask you: are you familiar — in the last

election, how many colored people were elected to county

office.

A

The very last one, the one that was held in

Greene County?

12

Q

Yes.

A

There are at least three or four.

after this Court's decision in Hadnotfe v. Amos.

Q

Yes.

Serving new.

A

There are about three or four»

I’m not

17

entirely sure what the offices are, Mr. Justice Black.

axe on the county commission and I think that’s a three or

19

four-man commission•

20

Q

They

They are on that county commission.

As I recall it, some of the key offices of the

21

county — I mean by key offices they could be helpful in

22

bringing about an elimination of discrimination — some of the

23

key officers of'the county were elected that were colored;

24

were they not?
*

25

A

There were some Blacks elected; yes* after
22

i

this Court’s order in Hadnott.
Q

2

Of course# because it had not been that way

3

before.

4

provide methods to see that each race had its proper right to

5

vote.

6

Not before the recent opinion that attempted to

A

Well that was true in that voting contest»

7

That’s really a part ©f submission with respect to the jury

8

commission that's in our brief here# that the Civil Rights

9

Commission's Report after — documented the alienation of

10

Blacks throughout the South generally and in Alabama and Green®

II

County# particularly and we indicated that one of the ways

12

to cure that is since jury service is kind of a trend of

13

voting service in terms of the general impact upon the public

14

life of the community# that-it5s extremely important# par­

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24

25

ticularly in a county like this was in the voting situation# to
have Black people serving on the jury commission.
Q

It’s important to have people -that can vote.

A

Oh# of course.

But. the jury commission at this

point is not an elective office# as a general proposition.

1

am simply saying thaton this record ~
Q

We must recall that if we could take out of the

state the power to select officials in any way they choose#
either by election or by appointment# that that would cut
against -either' one when the time arose.

Then the courts could

take the power instead of the legislative bodies.

23

i
2
3

A

I don't think the submission is nearly that

broadt, Mr. Justice Black.
Q

In the —

It is a rather unique thing to suggest that

4

the courts of the nation have a right to change the legisla­

5

tion in the state and say that instead of having appointments

6

they should have elections.

7

it wouldn't — but it might be rather unique in the history of

8

our government, wouldn't it?

9

A

It might be wise — I'm not saying

Well, I think it has occurred on occasion and

10

the decisions of this Court reflect those occasions, Louisiana

11

v. United States, for example, was a case in which the District

12

Court and this Court later affirmed a decree by that Court

3

requiring the registrars not to use a citizenship test, which

4

because of its discriminatory impact on the right of Negroes

IS
IS

to vote, and that's one example.
Q

That1s not an example of changing a law in

7

reference to the selection of officers, saying how they shall

8

be selected and invalidating a law which provides for appoint­

9

ment of certain people,—

20

A

I don't see that as an invalidation of the law.

21

Because I see thatonly as a remedial aspect of the Court's

22

equity powers that once you have a demonstrated constitutional

23

violation —

24
25

Q

We are up against a real practical situation.

You don't see -that if we were to hold that the Governor cannot

24

1

appoint, as the State Law provides, that that would be inter­

2

fering with the election laws of the state?

3
4

7

A

Well, I don’t see that»

It’s not an election

Q

It!s an election law that he can appoint —

law and —

1 mean it is & selection of officers that he shall appoint,
A

But what I address the question of how do you

8

deal with this terribly intractable problem of racial dis­

9

crimination when the Governor has consistently appointed only

10

white jury commissioners and those jury commissioners have

ii

consistently discriminated against Blacks and I think our
■»

12

Constitution can reach that and X think that this Court can

13

say that as a matter of remedy in this situation, without

‘14

invalidating that law as a general proposition —

15

Q

Why wouldn't it invalidate it?

16

A

I think if the invalidation occurs, Mr. Justice

17

Black, it occurs only in those, to use our term, unique

18

situations in which it, is clearly demonstrated, as it is in

19

this case, that this kind o£ wide range and deep-seated

20
21

22
23
24
23

discrimination has flourished.
Last year, for example, as a matter of remedy with
respect to the teacher integration in the Montgomery case, this
Court upheld the decree whereby a District Judge decided that
the way to get at this problem because, other methods had not
solved the problem, but the way to get at the problem was to

25

i

require a mathematical ration in the schools.

2

I'm simply saying of course it’s a unique proposi­

3

tion but there are certain circumstances when the constitu­

4

tional violation is so bold, where this Court in the past has

S

responded with that kind of relief and —
Q

6

I do not recall that it's been done to this

7

extent.

It8s essential both — as much to your people as it

8

is to the white people that we preserve the ancient landmarks

9

of the government and not depart completely from the idea of

10

— that they can elect their officials or appoint them in the

n

manner provided by law.
Someone suggested to me sometime ago that the way to

i2

13

prevent unfair trials in the South was to take defendants from

14

down there — white defendants and take them up and try them

15

in Harlem.

16

that was the best way to do it.

17

to say that this is the same, but I think, rather that Greene

18

County, they have made tremendous — almost miraculous progress

19

over there in the rights of the people to vote and select their

20

own officers.

And they stated it honestly with the belief that
OP course it's an exaggeration

j

21

A

They haven’t made that progress without a con­

ZZ

certed, judicial effort and litigation after litigation after

23

litigation, and this case is an example.

24
25

Q

I don't recall that we took away from the state

its right to appoint jury commissioners and demand that the

26

i

Governor appoint a jnan of a certain kind to the jury commis­

z

sion e

3

A

Well, it certainly seems that just as the

4

citisanes of Greene County are entitled to elect the persons

5

that they choose, the jury commission which performs a very

6

important public function, in that community, they are en­

7

titled also to have some representation of their group on that

8

commission.

B

Q

No one can disagree with you, I don't think.

m

A fair and-.equal government on that basis means that-they are

?i

entitled to it, but the question is

12

you and your group are as much interested in carrying on the

13

laws that ase fairly administered so that you don51 break down

U

the great structure of our democratic government by saying that

IS

the courts can require a certain people or great number of a

16

race be appointed to office by the appointed power, any more

\i

than we could say they must elect them.

ml

'

2'm asking you because

Of course, we can hold that they must adopt policies.

18
19

I’m not arguing against your point, that you do have a very

29

righteous causa of complaint in connection with this county,

2!

but I am trying to point out that we have reached it hereto­

22

fore and made miraculous progress -*— almost miraculous progress

23

as a man who lived in Alabama knows, almost the miraculous

24

progress that has been made in Green® County without destroying

25

any of the ancient landmarks of the country.

My time is up, Mr. Justice Black and I can only

say that it has taken very, very many decades and it is not
