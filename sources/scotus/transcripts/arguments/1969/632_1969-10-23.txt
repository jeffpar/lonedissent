PROCEEDINGS

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
you are ready»

MR. GREEN-BERG:

)

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

5

the Court:

6

to the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.

7

They involve the issue of the timing of desegregation of 14

8

Mississippi School Districts and the procedure by which this

9

is to be accomplished.

These cases Eire here under a writ of certiorari

'10

The basic issue here is how much longer Negro

11

school children in these cases in 14 Mississippi School

12

Districts, must wait to realize their constitutional right to

13

attend, desegregated school systems required by this Court more

14

than 15 years ago.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: . Mr. Greenberg, 2 over-

15
16

looked advising you and co-counsel and friends that Mr., Justice

17

Brennan was unavoidably detained, but he will participate in

18

the case on the basis, of course, of the entire recordi the

19

briefs and the tape recording of the oral arguments.

20 j

for hot having clarified that previously.
MR. GREENBERG:

21
>

You may proceed whenever

22
23

Excuse me

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

The basic issue here, as I said a moment ago, is
•

j how long Negro edfeool children in these districts must wait to
■«

|

24
25

realise their

institutional rights to.attend desegregated

schools decreed by this Court more than 15 years ago.

1

The law has been disobeyed by Respondent Districts

2

and the smarts below have not required obedience.

3

that the issues must be seen in historical context, for only

4

in that context is it apparent why that we urge that this

5

Court’s expression on timing must be unequivocal and further,

6

why particular procedures which we will describe below are

7

called for torachieve compliance with the Constitution.

We submit

■

The Plaintiffs in this case live in school district

8
9

in a state .whose resistance to the 14th Amendment that, is

10

second to none.

From 1954 to 1964 there was no school de-

If

segregation in Mississippi; instead the state passed doctrines;

12

of interposition and nullification.
Indeed, the University of Mississippi desegregated

13
n

not until more than a decade after this.Court's decision in

15

Sweatt against Painter; only after what can be called

16

resistance with the quality of rebellion and that at the cost

17

of life.

18

Hot until 1964 did the Mississippi Federal Courts

19

acknowledge that children of that state were subject to the

20

requirements of Brown against Board of Education and the first

21

case was Evers against Jackson Municipal, Separate School

22

District.

23

Evers, the Plaintiff, was shot and killed, a fact which bears

24

upon .Respondent School Districts continuing to adhere to

25

freedom of choice and the legality in Mississippi.

Shortly after the filing of that case, Medgar

A

l

1

Blit the sorriest part of the story lies in the

E

exercise, of discretion by some United States District Judges

3

in that state.

4

necessary and salutary, has been as to the setting of the

5

hearingi the time it takes to render judgment? the refusal

6

to file the claim attendant to the proceedings of this Court,

7

the Court of Appeals? and the exploitation of ambiguity —

3

real ambiguities and fancied ambiguities in the decisions of

9

this Court and the Court of Appeals.

That discretion, which in ordinary cases is

The District Court has commenced disciplinary

10

II

procedures against & civil rights lawyer, R. Jess Brown,

12

merely because he filed a Leake County case which is'here as

13

part of these proceedings, and sought to keep out-of-state

14

cMX rights lawyers from handling oases in the state, only

15

to be reversed by the Court of Appeals.

j

All of this has had the effect of perpetuating the

16

17

status quo, pendente lit© and so far in Mississippi the statua•

to take the unusual step in- an. order of August 20, 3.968,

setting a deadline for hearing in the District Court.
Titus and fete United States had appealed the District

24

Court’s refusal to set an early hearing on motions,following

25

•this Court’s decision in Green versus New Kent County.
5

The.

1

Court of Appeals set November 4th, 1968 as the deadline 'for

2

hearing on Titus9 motions and it directed the District Court

3

to enter an order granting relief within the 1968-69 school *

year.

The District Court did neithernotwithstanding the
Court of Appeals8 Noveraber 4th deadline.

The District Court

failed to render an appeal for five months and this precluded j
any relief for the 868-969 school year.
.

By May 13» .1969 it entered an order upholding the
same old freedom of choice plans on a totally unsupported
assumption that freedom of choice might work in the future.
The District Court here, astoundingly enough, consisted of over 3,000 pages of testimony, most of which was
devoted to the asserted proposition that Negro school child­
ren are the inferiors of whits.

'

.

The May 13th District Court Opinion reaffirming
the freedom of choice plans, justified their failure to
have desegregated because they do not think school boards

should proselytise in the Negro community and urge Negro
children to go to white schools.
The Court of Appeals reversed on July 3, 1969.
Q

Pardon iae, Mr. Greenberg.

Could you tell me

what you mean about your sentence about proselytising?
A

Yes.

That’s an opinion.

Q

I mis sad. what you said? could you repeat it?

Well, the reason why they said freedom of

2

choice might work — why freedom of choice had'failed to work

3

was be.ca-4.se the Court of Appeals Jefferson Order says that

4

school districts could npt go out into the community and urge

5

children to attend certain schools — prohibiting them from

6

doing that.

And they said that is why it didn't work.

The Court of Appeals on July 3, 1969 announced its
timetable which gives rise to the instant petition*

The Court;

of Appeals requested the Department of Health, Education, and j
Welfare to draw up desegregation plans for the Respondent
■
District and present those plans to the District Court by
August: 1.1s 69 for hearing on August 23rdp if there ware any
objections in the Respondent School Districts„
September 1st, eight days later, was the deadline
for implementation of the plans and the Court of Appeals Oxdei
used the term "immediately."

Accordingly, a team of 77

educators from the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare, with distinguished credentials that appear in the
record and are reproduced in the Appendix to our petitionP

20
21

22
23
24
25

paid a series of visits to the school districts in question
and produced detailed plans.
Now, we have filed with the Court sets of these
plans here, a sufficient number for each Justice to have a set
of plans? detailed plans for the desegregation of the school
districts in question.

7

1

One is inspections and plans compared to numerous

2

other plans which have found their way to the courts, and to

3

this Court I only find that they are as careful and detailed

4

as one might hope for -- the mechanics and logistics and

5

number of students and number of rooms and the drawing of son?:

6

linesin addition to which they go into something which they

7

have made much of on and off again in various parts of tha

8

proceedings below: the whole question of human relations and

/

9

?
announcing the necessity of obedience to the law and setting

'10

up training sessions and training teachers to work is teams

11

and so forth and so on»

12
13

On August 19th? however? the Secretary of Health?
Education? and Welfare wrote a letter to the Court of Appeals

14

and the District Judges withdrawing these plans»

15

stated that as the Officer of the United States Government

16

His letter appears in the

Appendix to our petition on Page 64(a) and we quotes

short space of time remaining must surely? in my judgment,

the 222 schools of the 32 Mississippi Districts for their only

available educational opportunities.

I might add that ©f the 14 cases appealed of the

at which the new desegregation plans were to be complied
with ox to be done.

The letter was completely open-ended, j©nlv

proposing resubmission of some plan by December 1st.
Having seen this letter, the Court of Appeals asked
the District Judge to hold a hearing on the Secretary's
request to withdraw plans, which the District Court did.

The*

Secretary's letter was filed by motion of the Department cf
Justice, I might add.
At the District Court hearing, which was the hearing

As to the third,

Thirds The matter of timing, which is, of course,

7

one part of •— a crucial part of the issue here.

A —

8

contemplating and drawing up of plans originally -*• when the

9

Court of Appeals gave a mandate or presented a question.to the

10

Department of Health, Education, And Welfare, it requested

11

the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to draw plans

12

of what is the certain timetable.

13

those j^ans might be worked into effect on August 23rd and if

14

ordered into effect on August 23rd they v/ereito be plans which

That timetable was that

between August 23rd and September 1st would become operational,
Now, Mr. Andry, who was the Chief of all the experts
who examined✓the school systems.

Mr. Andry wrote a letter

which is in the record here at Page 44a of our Appendix in
which he addressed himself not only to the substance of the
plans, but the timing.

On Page 44a of our petition, is a

rather lengthy letter that discussed in critical detail how
these plans were developed.

He says;•

-»

651 believe that each of the enclosed plans,
educationally and administratively, both in terms of substance
and in terras of timing —"
11

1

Q

May I ask you a question?

Did the original

2

Court of Appeals contemplate that the filing of objections to

3

the plans, the hearing in the District Court on any objections

4

review in the Court of Appeals and the possible petition to

5

this Court for certiorari would all take place between August

6

11 and September 1?

A

It did not express itself on all aspects —

8

I imagine that one of the problems would foe — he did contem­

9

plate there would be objections and he issued a

10

issue as to stays and so forth»

But it did contemplate that

Did the Court of Appeals' opinion

The Court of Appeals Order did not address itself

to what: was happening between the time of the entry of an
order for putting plans into effect# in any review which any
party might seek.

It did not address itself to that, in spite
12

j *

1

of the fact, that we wanted the plans to go Into effect on

2

September 1st,

3
4
S

Q

If the report; submitted to the District Court

was accepted by the District Court and ordered him to — into
execution at that time# that is to say in time for September

6

1st or thereabouts, would you think this -would have been

7

within the power of -the Court of Appeals to let that plan be

S

carried cut,, pending any appeal and further proceedings?

9

A

Oh, certainly, Mr, Chief Justice; and that has !

10

occurred on other occasions.

11

Court at this time such as the case of Oklahoma City and

12

Denver there are plans in effect pending review.

13

And in several cases in this

There is a paragraph on Page 37a of the Court of

14

Appeals’ Order which 1 think partly answers the question

15

explicitly and partly indicates the Court of Appeals' attitudej

16

to such a proposition; that is what shall happen to a review.

r/

If I may, I would like to read it.

18

"To determine the urgency of formulating an approved

19

plan to be implemented in the 1969-70 school terms, it is

The mandate of -—"because of the urgency” — the

record's urgency — "of formulating an approved plan to be
presented for the 1969-70 school term is ordered as follows;
”The mandate of this Court shall be issued immed­

18

The Court will determine the time of briefing and fox- oral

That's a repetition in there.

20
"No consideration w

1 be given to the fact that

21

22

interruption of the school year inthe event further relief
i
> is indicated." I would say'that indicates an attitude of

23
urge&gy which.makes it exceedingly unlikely that tha Court of
24
Appeals would stay any Order that there might be as to

desegregating these schools.
So, it does not address itself specifically to the
question of that.

Hot linked to any district?

not linked to any educational, administrative or logistical
factor; not linked to any particular time for any generalized
objections; do not even begin to approach the requirements by
the showing prescribed by the second Brown decision, much less
by the attitude of urgency that has been expressed by the
Courts in recent decisions in which, as Mr. Justice Black has
said in his Opinion in Chambers, the Court has expressed the
view that the time is now.
The District Court, following the hearing, recommen­
ded that the delay requested by the Secretary be granted.

And

the Court of Appeals, in citing what occurred — what had
occurred, without, comment or explanation

did just that.

Petitioner^ after having asked Mr. Justice Black
to vacate the Court of Appeals3 amendment concerning the Order
brought the case hare on certiori and this Court has granted
a review, according to an accelerated schedule.
We .submit the Order of the Court of Appeals, as

23

amended, be vacated and urge that this Court do two things:
24
First, we submit ..that the history of southern school

15

fi

desegregation ia certain areas, such as these here today,

2

calls for ?, declaration by this, Court, in the words of Mr.

3

Justice Black, ”that petitioners are entitled to have their

4

Constitutional rights indicated and now, without postponement

5

for any reasons'1 or as he put it otherwise^ "There are no

8

longer statistical issues in the question of making effective,

7

not only promptly, but at once, now, orders sufficient to

vindicate the right that any pupil in the United States would

3

effectively be excluded from a public school -on account of hi3

10

race or color.

Ho delays -should be permitted for administra­

>•

11

tive or any other reasons.'1
Second, and we think -this is perhaps more important

12

13

because we think the Court has — well, not entirely explicitly,

14

very explicitly indicated the former that we asked.

15

for the institution of procedures which will make, this declara**

Now, an effort to elaborate on why we have* asked for
the relief that we have requested.

As to our first request

for the rights ‘to be declared effectiva as of now.
pose is not merely rhetorical.

The pur­

There is no particular

satisfaction that Plaintiffs or the children in this district,
when, if their lawyers would take out of the declaration by
this Court saying: "Now, this Court hasn't said virtually
$
that,"or, as Mr. Justice Black has indicated, there perhaps
might he some uncertainty about it.
So long as there are administrative reasons for
delay recognised the certain consequences follow,

first,

disruption and threats of disruption; threats of chaos and
confusion, to borrow the language of Secretary Finch, are at

While in Aaron against Cooper and Buchanan against

resistance and violence are no grounds for delay.

o

there is the question: is that the kind of administrative

Secondly, litigation over administration takes time.

13

Lrtigants and Courts with a disposition to delay, will explore "

14

the issue of administration at very great length, even when

15

they don’•-t..exist,

16

by hostility.

17

at all, this avenue should be foreclosed, as Mr. Justice Black .

18

suggests, by making the rights effective instantly.

that the need for human relations work and informing people

If they should go into effect now and it would

20

have to be understood that you would have to go through cer­

4

A

Yes, and the Department contemplated, in view

5

of the fact that certain building plans were in process, they

S

would wait for those plans to be completed and consequently,

7

desegregation would be completed there in the '70-*71 school

let all the .children, black and white alike, share such

13

buildings as they have at the present time.

14

when they have more buildings, then they can redistribute

15

them.

16

Q

In 70 and ’71

So, what you suggest is that — what, do you

17

urge that our order should he with respect to those two

schools?
A

19•

That the Department of Health, Education, and

20

Welfare or soma other agency selected by the Court of Appeals,

21

give the directions within a brief time period to make the

22

necessary revisions in those plans to put them into affect

23

right now.
Q

24

Are you — you are not suggesting, Ihope, Mr.

i

25

Greenberg, that, this Court appraise and evaluate these plans.
32

1
2

are you?
A

No,

I think that this Court can appraise and

3

evaluate the quality of the plans on the record which has been

4

made about them, without reading the plans themselves. I:ll

5

confess I subjected myself to that and they seem like any

6

other plans and they certainly come with better credentials

7

than any other plans, I would say.

8

But, the Court of Appeals — this Court enter an

implemented.

11

the details of that.

As I understand it, your suggestion that the

system of dual schools be ended immediately?

14

A

That’s correct, Mr. Justice Black.

15

q

If that requires the buildings —- if the

buildngs are unsatisfactory, then they do the best they can
until such improvements can be made.
A

That’s correct, Mr. Justice Black.

Q

Could X ask you a question:

Have you filed

objection© or exceptions inthe —* under the original order of
the Court of Appeals to any of the plans of HEW?

A

You had not at that time?

A

Mot -- there was no opportunity to — the only

rules we were exposed to were the ’70“971 plans.
33

!
2

Q

To get on focus again, your entire action is

directed to the timing problems, I gather?

Since the formation of the Committee and since these

11

12
13
24
15
16

lawyers have begun to speak out, as Mr» Greenberg suggests,
there has bees less vigorous resistance to these orders? more
graceful compliance.

19

20
22
22

Schools in such places as Bcgalusa,

Louisiana have been ,

’.he subject of orders for reorganisatio^

i

of dual school systems into unitary school systems and which
orders have been honored and obeyed.
Recalling the Committee’s continuing role and

27

23

will facilitate prompt, and graceful, if not

interest in this aspect of the administration of justice, it
became

concerned that the actions? of the lower courts and

accounts, at least, of some of the actions of the United
States during the pendency of these proceedings, might tend
to cues® an unraveling of the atmosphere of respect which has
\
been developed over these recent hard years.

23
We were heartened by this Court’s prompt action on
24

the petition for certiorari.

And now that the case is here we

25
35

1

have some suggestions as amicus curiae on the merits, pri­

2

marily with respect to remedy.
Our suggestion to the Court in general here, that

3
4

the decision and order of the Court of Appeals of August,

S

1969 should be affirmed insofar as it orders a reorganization

6

of the dual school system in these districts into a unitary

7

system.

8
9

But the August Order of the Court, unlike the July
order of the Court, not only set back for 90 days the periods

10

for formulation of plans, but it failed to do what the July

11

order had done, namelys to prescribe, not only basic formula­

12

tion of plans, but also precise dates for the commencement

13

of implementation.

24

directing a further ordering a precise date for the completior

15

of these — or at least substantial progress toward the

IS

completion of the decentralization plan.

17
18

And we would suggest an order or mandate

An order that describes dates, not only for
formulation but for performance with the plan.

19

Q

What date 'do you suggest, Mr. Qberdorfer?

20

A

'four Honor, we have not been in this litigation?

21

22
23
24
25

we haven3t bean in the crucible of detail about it.

We really

can8t make a responsible suggestion for a particular date.
We do suggest that as the Court of appeals set down? 1 refer
to Page 37a in the Appendix to the petition that no considera­
tion should foe given? that the Court of Appeals should be
3S

1

firm in this respect* no consideration should be given to the

2

fact of interrupting the school year inthe event that further

3

relief is indicated.
We wanted to suggest to the Court in appraising the

4
5

mandate* that — and the United States in its last memorandum,

6

conceded as much* but there is no reason to worry too much

7

about having this done before summer.

8

suggest from the point of view of the administration of

15

m
17
18
10

20
21

22
23
24
25

As we would like to

justice and from the point of five of law enforcement* if you
will* that

nobody's an expert on this* I suppose* but

there, are good reasons to believe that the reorganizationof
the schools can be better accomplished during the school
years when the students are in school? when the teachers are
in school? when the courts are in daily business? when tills
«

Court is in session* than would be possible if we had* as has
happened over and over again in so many school districts, thii
matter decided more or less in rhetoric in the spring* as it
happened in this case* then in the summer doldrums set in*
and then about August when everybody concerned is on holiday*
w® suddenly ~ and law enforcement people* courts* school
administrators* teachers and students are suddenly confronted
with the — whatever activity goes on to try to delay past
the opening of schools.
'*

As the matter of fact* to set these things down for

the first day of school is an invitation to them

37

those who

1

try to interfere, to — oh the theory that if they could just

2

get by that first day of September, then they are home free

3

for another year.

4

So

5

Q

Do you suppose, Mr. Oberdorfer, that, that last

6

sentence of the Court of Appeals was entered in the- opinion

7

that you just react —

j

8

A

37~a?

i

9

Q

37-a — was directed to the proposition that

10

there is apparently no formal semester»

11

approximately mid-year, as they have in many other places, and

i2

that they were — the Court of Appeals was suggesting that if

13

this can't ba done until December, let it be done in December»

U

Do you think that's what they were driving at?
A

15

The mid-year or

I think that's a possible interpretation, Your

16

Honor*

17

saying — probably they were saying what I was trying to say:

18

namely, that whenever you do it, don't worry about waiting

19

until June in order to do it? don't worry about waiting until

20

September when in the normal course of expediting litigation

21

and expedited effort by the — administered by the Executive

22

Branch,fee matter is ready to go? the plans to complete it.

23

Go ahead with it, if it happens to be the third day of November,

24
25

then

1 think, though — I really think that they were

gc ahead on the third day of November.
Q

Well, there is no point in quibbling about this

3G

1

language, .Mr, Oberdorfer.

2

the Court of Appeals of July 3rd, it's basic thrust was to

3

But I understood this opinion of

omt a plan of unitary school system,, a desegregated .-system into

4

effect as of September first.

5

A

That’s correct, Your Honor.

6

Q

September 1, 1969, and that this final sentence

7

refero only to the possibility of further relief, or further

8

ancillary relief that might be included.

9

A

Well, it’s possible that it means that no

10

stay — it might mean that no stay of the order effective

11

Sept.@i*§‘3:r 1st will be granted simply because there may be a

12

later interruption in th& school fear.
In any event, the Government ’ s mesiorandut.. of

13
14

yesterday, says that: "We believe that the courts below may

15

properly be authorised t© require the implementationof plans
|

16

commencing at the most practical, imminent juncture of the

17

school year."

I

How# i have two suggestions about that.

18
19

20

'

One is

perhaps instead of authorising the courts below to require
■
implementation,of the plans# as I read that, sometime during

21

the school year, that this Court’s mandate direct the Court of

22

Appeals to enter an order to that effect.

23

>.

Q

If I understand — I think I do — that you are

24

in agreement with Mr. Greenberg's suggestion that the thing to

25

do is to say that the dual system is over and that it
39

i

1

is to go into effect today, and that there is no reason for

2

delay by reason of the fact: that things will not be perfect

3

the first day.

4

agree with his position on that?

The thing to do is to go at it now.

5

A

S

exactly what "now" is.

7

Q

8

(Laughter)

9

h

Do you

X agree with that, Your Honor, without knowing

I mean when we issue an order — if we do.

If you do, Your Honor.

I had thought that

10

the Order could well be an order to the Court of Appeals to

1!

direct the District Court to enter an order and for that

12

length of time for that mandate to get down to them., would be j

13

inappropriate, if that's the decision.
In any event, there is no reason to wait for the end

14
15

of the school year.
Q

16

17

about "deliberate speed."
A

18

Correct.

spaed?

21

A

22

(Laughter)

23
24

And furthermore —

You would like tohave us act with all deliberat?

19

There is no reason to wait on future arguments

Paster than that, Your Honor,

GEL ARGUMENT OF JERRXS LEONARD, ASSISTANT

2

ATTORNEY GENERAL, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED

3

STATES

4

MR, LEONARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

5

the Court:

6

Court seriously consider affirming the judgments qf the courts

7

below and before the questioning of the counsel previously

B

completely takes over the situation, I urge this Court not to

9

he too caught up in the frustration that counsel have portrays

10

I first of all would respectfully request this

to the Court today»

!1

1 don’t mean that for a moment to imply that there

12

isn’t a great deal of frustration involved, for there is»

13

lat me just, for a few moments, set the stage for a very brief

14

argument 2 am going to make, to give you a little background

15

on where we stand with respect to southern school desegrega­

16

tion g because ,X, unfortunately, think that there are those who

17

take an entirely pessimistic'point of view and 2, for one,

18

would like to be on the side of taking a more, optimistic point

19

of view and I think those of us who deal daily with the ./•'

20

problems of school desegregation, can safely say to this

21

Court feat im have made seme rather substantial breakthroughs

22

in school desegregation and in truth and in fact the end of

£3

the road is sight.

24
23

but

It is in sight, admittedly a long road,

it is in sight.
First of all, we are now in the area of Green.

41

But

I

Counsel continued to refer to the Green decision as an impor­

2

tant turning ‘
point? and indeed itvaa an important turning

3

point? but Green was handed down by this Court just. 18 months

4

ago.

5

Prior to Green.the requirements that were laid down

S

by this Court could, in the main be met by a school district

7

adopting some sort, of a free transfer plan, generally put

3

together in the phrase ”freedom of choice.”

9

this the school district was generally considered to be in

10

compliance with the mandate of the court.

11

all that.

And upon doing

But Green changed

and since the time of Green there hsa been substan­

12

13

tial progress; substantively, as well as procedural, in school

14

desegregation.

13

Green only approximately 20 percent of Negro children in

IS

southern schools had moved into desegregated schools„ In the

17

one school year which was affsetsd by the Green decision, at

Whereas, in the 14 years from Brown 1 to

13

least according to the figures supplied by the Department of

19

Health,. Education, and Welfare, in that one school year ass to

20

the effective date of

21

that today it's approximately 40 percent, again, in the

'

that figure almost doubled.

So

«•»

22
23
24

25

southern states.
How, whether that figure is completely accurate or
not is not the important issue —
Q

The 40 percent figure is 40 percent of what?
42

3

A

Of the total number of Negro children involved.

E

Q

We are in what?

3

A

These are in -die school districts in the

4

southern states.

5

about

6

may. be de facto school situations, and obviously it would be

7

much less than that when you take those into account.

8

we’re talking today about school districts where segregation

9

was official policy.

10

In the southern states — I’m not talking

de jure school districts, without reference to what

But

But what is material about the Green decision?

11

What is important; is that it literally opened up a new era

12

for the guarantee of the 14th Amendment rights of these Negro

13

children on the one hand; also- the educational benefits for

14

white children and they are there, of desegregated education.

15

So, we’re a little genuinely — a little disturbed

16

about those who become frustrated and say it's been 15 years

17

since Brown.

38

been 18 months since Green, because that's when die important

19

turning point, we feel, came about in substantial progress.

20

Now, let me give you specific examples?

Wall, that’s true, but it’s more true to say it":?

In 9 deep

21

south states there are better than 1100 school districts.

22

Prior to the Green, decision more than 200 of those were, in

23

fact, already desegregated, leaving 900 affected by the Green

24

decision.

25

f
gated, or have in the works and in implementation.

Since Green, 400 of those 900 are either desegre-

43

1

satisfactoryy at least according to the District Courts',

2

satisfactory desegregation plans.

3

Another 100 including these districts are subject to so-

4

called Green motions to improve the status in those districts,

8

leaving 400 in which at this point are being made on behalf

6

of the children in those 400 districts.

7
8
9

Q

They are in operation.

By that, you mean that as to those 400 there

is nO pending litigation?
A

Nothing going on.

And many of those are

10

districts whose substantial number — better than 25 percent,

11

are districts in which Federal funds havebeen cut off or are

12

laying fallow, so to speak.

13
14
15

Q

Do you have any figures for, say, the North

like the Green in the Midwest?
A

Justice Douglas, I am trying to say that our

16

figures for the North are very scarce, but I want to point out

17

to the Court that the Department has commenced de jure type

.18

19
20
21

22\
23
24
25

litigation here against -the northern school districts
it has been found.

where

And it has commenced litigation or at

least investigated segregation of faculties, even in de facto
northern school districts.
1 do want to point out tothe Court that there is a
procedural problem, at least with respect to the Government,
and that3 s the

requirements IV of the ' ’64 Civil Sights Act,

which the Attorney General must have a written complaint from
44

1i

a parent fcsfQgQ ha can initiate litigation.

2

have an effect upon these remaining 400,

3

Congress to remove that,, and hopefully, that may be done.

4

So, that does

We have asked the

Sow, let me turn to Green for a moment, as it applies

5

to the instant cases,

I don * t think there is any question

6

in anyone8 s mind that Green requires these school boards to

7

act, but the fact of the matter is that we must be cognisant

8

that this ~ whatever the reason is that they didn't act? they

9

didn’t act.

And there are many other districts similarly

10

situated, like these 33,

11

true —* that fact is true in too many jurisdictions, and

12

therefore, the job of drawing up desegregation plans is, in

13

fact, going to fall to the district courts.

14

courts in many, many eases, have called upon the Government;

15

have called upon HEW for help, and rightly so, and X think

IS

that that's going to aid the total desegregation process.

17

Whether you like it or not, it's

And the district

The Attorney General has said 'himself, that the fact

18

that you can call upon qualified experts, the courts can, at

19

HEW to help in this psoeess, is going to assist the district

20

courts? assist the school districts themselves, if they want

21

to be assisted? if they want to cooperate.

22

then these people are there to assist the District Courts and

23

the Secretary of HEW himself, has joined in twith this idea of

24

using these educational, experts to aid 'the school districts

25

and the district courts.

45

If they don't,

I

But X plead with this Court to remember that these

2

people are professionals; they are professional educators and

3

their professional judgment must be given some weight? it

4

must ba given some credence or the entire experiment is going

5

to fail; and if it fails, we will return to the time where the]

6

District Court judge, and the lawyers from both slues will be

7

sitting across from each other with the school district map

8

drawing lines and sticking pins and drawing some more lines.

9

And 1'a not talking &out a New Kent Comity type of case; I ha

10

not talking about a two-school school district: ©na black and

11

one white.

12

these cases which are terribly complicated.

But there are districts in this situation among

13

Q

Terribly what?

14

A

Complicated.

15

Q

16

Did you read the brief from ’the American

Educational Association?

17

&

1 have, Your Honor.

18

Q

And do you agree with what or disagree with

h

I disagree with it? I agree, however, with the

19
20

that?

21

two experts who are members of that association, who testified

2.2

on behalf of the Government with respect to the complexity of

23

—- and I’m not saying that all of the districts are -the same.

24

Some of them, I am sure» are very simple.
Mr. Greenberg said that of two schoolhouse

46

districts, there is at least on© that has only three in it.

1

That, isn't terribly complicated.

2

Q

3

But there are complications.

Why do you have to have plans? to — just say

"we're not going to have a dual system," and we are going to

4
5

.

do it now?.
A

Mr. Justice Black, I was just going to get to

8

Q

How does that do anything except delay?

9

A

Mr. Justice Black, what this Court has required

6
7

that.

10

in Green is a reorganisation of school districts; a reorgani­

11

sation that is really, in fact, a measure — a measure of

12

two separate and distinct school systemss one black and one

13
14
15

16
17
18
19

20
21

22

23
24
25

white into one.
Now, the testimony in this case clearly shows that
in some of these districts that this is going to include
grade restructuring, faculty reorganisation, realignment of
bus routes *—
Q

Why not do it and put it into effect and submit

that, arrangements he made, thereafter?

h

Well, then the "what” is the problem, Mr.

Justice Black.
Q

What?

A

The "what" is the problem. ' You have to do

something and that something has to be some kind of a plan.
/
The csif!’ is the problem.

My point is that the frustration? 1 think? is

more properly directed to the 18 months because —

Q

You want to divide it up into segments?

20

A

Hop I really don't.

21

22

(Laughter)

A

I really don't? Your Honor.

What X*m pleading

23

with this Court is not to do something precipitous? like the

24

pendents lit® ideal.

25

Q

Could anything be precipitous in this deal now?;
43

A

1

With all due respect, Your Honor — let me

2

say that many hundreds of thousands of the children that we

3

are talking about are children of a vary tender age.

4

of those little people are six and seven and eight and nine

5

years old, and what you do with them can have an effect on

8

their* total future life.

7

that we are trying to improve the education of the Negro

8

children; we know we will improve the education of -the white

9

children by desegregation, anyway, but let's try to do it with

10

some order.

Wasn't that a slight warning?

I think that it was, Mr. Justice Marshall, but

1 think it was in Green that this Court articulated the need
to have plans; plans realistically designed to work now.

1

We believe that's what the law is.

2

got to get the plans? you've got to find the way to get the

3

plans into effect? into a court order in these situations#

4

because the districts in too many situations, will not volun­

5

tarily put these plans into effect, and that's the point I

6

make.
Q

7

Well;.

The question is:

you have!
|

in this case we have had reports and

8

there have been formulated plans for these 14 school districts *

9

To be sure, they may be subject to refinement, in some of their

10

details, but in any particular case, these are the plans

11

of the 14 school districts.
A

12

Mr. Justice Stewart, let me point out to you

13

that I don't think there is any disagreement about plans.

14

There is some clear-cut testimony from both of the witnesses,

15

and

1©

testimony of people like the

17

ment presented, that the Secretary acted and did what he did.

IS

This wasn't something that he pulled out of the air.

19

acted upon the advice of the people who were involved in the

.20

drawing of these plans, and what they say is really two

21

things?

22

need validating.

.23

substantial reorganisation of the bus routes, but there is no

24

bus to them.

25

I might point out that this authority was based on the
two witnesses that the Govern­

He

old children to stand out in the street corner waiting for the

being of great difficulty.

4

But the fact of the plans — the fact of the matter
is that the plans as filed were not as refined and as complete

6

as they could have been if these men who worked nights, week­

7

ends — 2’ra talking about the educators — if they had had an

8

opportunity to really refine them.

That’s Problem Number 1.

Problem Number 2 was that September 1st was the key

10

day, because it was September 1st that the Court of Appeals

11

set down as decision clay.

12

into effect on September 1st.

13

school districts already had been open three or four or five

14

— 2*m not sure just how many, but some of them were.

15

majority of them were opening, I believe, on September 2nd, the

Well, the two witnesses that you had testify

12

for the United States indicated some dissatisfaction with these,

plans.

Not dissatisfaction so much with the total

plan, as with the lack of an ability to validate the plans.

I’m not sure I know what you mean by that.

Just one question, if 1 may;

If there had

been no appeal here after the Court of Appeals had acted,
and in view of assurance that the plans would have been sub-

j

ra.ltted on December 1st, or is it the 15th — December 1st in

12

reason, why they would not have been submitted on that date?

10
11

A

15

Mr. Chief Justice, the plans — if this Court

18

does nothing with this lawsuit between now imd December 1st,

17

the plans will be submitted on December 1st and all of those

18

elements of the plans which can be implemented according to

19

the decision of the Fifth Circuit •— all of those which have

20

any 3 easonable hope of being implemented during this school

22

the desegregation plan. — all of those that can be implemented

in the

Again, this is depandent

upon the decision by the District Court, but our urging will
ba — let me put it that way.
54

And if there are any elements

1

in those desegregation pians which cannot be implemented

during- this school year, we will expect the school boards to

come forth and meet the burden and show why that particular

element, or those particular elements in that plan will not

be met.»

11

12

students<>
Many times school reorganisation, Mr. Justice White,

13

will call for the building of middle schools, separating a

14

grade structure — if you will look at this plan you will see

15

that many of these schools are k through 12; k through 8, plus

16

a high school.

17
18

There are grade schools feeding high schools

and please understand, I am not an educational expert By any
means — but many times what will happen is that in -the re­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. SATTERFIELD,ESQ.
OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SATTERFIELD:

Mr. Chief Justice and the Court:

20

It is a pleasure to appear before you today in this connec­

21

tion because there a;c quite a number of matters which need

22

to be cleared up for the benefit of the Court, the litigants

23

and of the children herein involved.

24
25

The first is this:

That this procedure has been

handled by the officials in the same way they handled the

60

1

before the Fifth Circuit of — this was purely a motion

2

concerning a docket sale, at which time the Fifth Circuit had

3

no record before it; no evidence before it; no briefing of

4

of the basis merits

5

Secondly, and these cases appeared, as.1 understand

3

it, before the Fifth Circuit, they were urged upon eight

days, notice.

The record was in four packing boxes and was not

would accept the finding of the District Court on all matters

11

of fact which, with deferen.ce, it wholly failed to do.

12

This proceeding resulted without the record before

13

the Court, although it. was available to be brought even within

14

the time limited under Rules 20 and 12 of this Court and Rule

13

11 of-the Rules of the Federal procedure.

IS

tod this is, again, an objection, to make broad

17

statements, not supported by the record, because the statement

13

they made about some 3,000 pages of testimony, most of which'

19

was directed toward the allegation that there is a difference

20

in the intelligence of Negro and white children.

21

ment is absolutely without any foundation in fact, and contrary

22

to the truth.

Petitioner's were willing for the Court to have the opportunity

issues.

They differ in many, many different ways.

Now, 2 call the Court’s particular attention to the

18

fact that as has been stated to this Court — we did not know

Now, reference was made to the chaos which might

proper things.
Now, here is what Mr. Finch said:

He said this:

m

"I am gravely concerned that the time allowed by the Department

m

of these terminal plans has been too short for the educators

14

of the Office of Education to develop terminal plans which

25

can be implemented this year.”

'?6

He says, “The administrative and logistics pose

17

difficulties to the administrators which must be encountered

18

and made in a terribly short space of time, must share in my

19

judgment, produce chaos, confusion and a catastrophic educa­

20

tional setback to the children involved."

21

22
23

"An administrative difficulty," and here is the
prayer that is now made, and we will quote:
"The first is:

That there should not be any hearing

24

by the District Court that this Court should overrule or

.25

modify Brown Is Brown 2; Cooper, Green, Red and all other

64

cases that have beei> decided by this Court and should put into

10

the plans.

11

It was found by the District Court and affirmed by

12

the Court 'of Appeals that when various plans had been

13

submitted and withdrawn, were presented to the local educational

14

authorities, they would preserve with the statement and I can

15

psdve tills because it is in the record and is undisputed and it

16

is — X was present when it was done.
As the record shows, it states that there was no

The fact is, and we have certified to it in our

brief, beginning with 1959, 1962, .1964, 1966 tap through

That freedom of choice plans were proper?

They are law-abiding citisens and those who allege

14

otherwise, do so being, I hope, innocent of the facts, to be

15

most charitable to them.
May it please the Court, with reference to the matter

16
17

of briefs.

Of course, as the; Court knows, in that case,

18

freedom of choice was by no means outlawed.

19

the Court has noted on Page 31 of the letters to be filed by

20

the Petitioners that th© prayer that is made clear is not with

21

reference to desegregation.

Mow, by the way,

The prayer is as follows concernin

£3

“'That this Court should make 'the action pendente

24

11te requiring that integration and not segregation be the

25

status quo pendente lite."

66

In other words, that integration

i

and not desegregation be made the status quo pendente lite»

2

And yet this Court says in Denning and in Carr, that there is

3

a law of the land and recited by this Court as follows:

such a plan»

We do not hold that a freedom of choice plan,

of itself, might be unconstitutional," Our argument has. been
that this Court specifically declined so to hold? rather,- all
they did say is that in desegregating a dual system the plan
of:freedom of choice is not an end in itself»
\
In closing there are two things I do want to call
your attention to»

.The fact is -X am somewhat embarrassed after

reading the brief to admit that I'm a charter member of the
Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law®

I was the

one to. arrange for them to open an.office in Jackson,
Mississippi and for a number of years they did.a very fine job®
Recently, it's quite a different situation.

I'll refer you to

my brief in that connection and in connection therewith.
The other is this:

That where and if the Court

grants the prayer which is now made and the request which is now
before this Court? that is that integration shall be the —
pendente lit® shall be the matter of the day®

Now, if that

were to be carried out there would be a conflict —• .
I recognise that time has run out, sir.
speed is no longer the call of the day.
and coma right now, realistically.

r

*•’3

Deliberate

Everything must come

!

The question of delay here did not come from the

2

school districts? It came from those public educators of the

2

United States of America who found that the plans that were

4

drawn under the pressure that was working was such that they

3

could not recommend and asked that they be withdrawn.

.

6

Q

Let me get something straight here

maybe 1

7

misunderstood it.

1 do not understand under the proposal of

8

your opponents that the 'tilings in these plans thatyou have

9

been criticising would be. foreclosed from objection and

10

ultimately reviewed by this Court, if necessary, if their

If

proposal went into effect.

12

Do I misunderstand it?

13

&

14

No,

May it please Idle Court, 1 think it could

be foreclosed in two ways

55

Q

You say that it would be foreclosed?

16

A

In fact I think it would, ih ray judgment.

17

The act that would be required to put into effect pendente

IS

lite is another way of putting into immediate effect without

19

a way — without an opportunity for consideration by either

20
21

22

23
24
25

this Court or the Court of Appeals, even.
And if broad changes such as those that were that
suggested are mad®, they would be — not exactly irreparable,
but irretrievable; could never even change the Act.
Then, may it please the Court, 1 believe that it
means that if what they ask is granted, it would not be
68

1

done ia this school year, because they are asking that the

•

District Courts not be permitted to have any — but that their
experts be use-1 as special masters by the Court of Appeals .
And while, at some time there might be a later appeal/ 1
believe it would be water down the drain.
I do believe that if their request is-set that it
could never be — we take the position that one of the dis­
tinguished Members of this Court took on May 6, 1955? Mr.
Justice Marshall, when he said in brief filed in Brown II?
"The Negro

children before the Court in these cases are en­

titled to public education on a nonsegregated basis»

The only

way that relief can be given meaningfully to them, is to
abolish the policy of using race a© a criterion for assignment
of pupils.

Thus, the only-effective decree would be one which

would enjoin the use of race in the assignment Of any pupils
in the school districts involved.
Before I leave 1 would like to read the position
taken by Mr. Justice Goldberg in Brown in which he said: "We
do not mean for it to be understood that there is aavthisf in
the 14th Amendment which makes it mandatory that, pupils be given
a choice of schools.

We mean that the elimination of compulsory

segregation is not the same thing as the compulsory attendance
of whites and Negro students or Negroes at white schools.
Negroes and whites would no more be compelled to attend' the same
schools under such regulations than are Negroes and whites

And may I say, finally, in response to a question,
1 believe, by Mr. Justice Marshalls that the question of 'the

REBUTTAL -ARGUMENT BY JACK GREENBERG, ESQ.

25

Thank you, Mr. Satterfield

ON -BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

71

MR. GREJSiSBERGs

1

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court? 1 have a few moments of rebuttal, if I may.

2

Mr» Satterfield has made regular reference to the

3
4

absence of a record in this Court and I think that's very

5

illuminating because I might say that there is, indeed, the

6

complete record in the Court and it has been here for some

7
8

considerable period of time». It's in Mr. Davis’s office right
»
behind the Court? it’s not before the Court? it is b&nind the

9

Court.
The problem was, in obtaining this record, and it

10

teaches us something about this litigation.

11

When we filed this

case here we asked the Clerk of the Fifth Circuit to send up

12

the records.

13

He sent up everything that he had, however a

part of the record was in Judge Cos's Court,

H

We requested

Judge Cos’s Court to sand the record up and he refused.

15

He

sent a lawyer to visit the Clerk and the Clerk said that he

16

had to get 50 cents a page for the record and we said we

17

didn't we could not pay that money for thousands and thousands

18

of pages of record and the lawyer went and visited Judge Cox

19

and Judge Cox @aid he would not send the record up, and indeed,

20

he thought the price had gone up,

21

We then communicated with Mr. Davis of this Court,

22

who process communications wtih the Federal District Court in

23

Mississippi arid he obtained the record and it sits there in

24

eight huge boxes for anyone who cares to read it.

25
"f

72

That: is the story of the litigation in this case*

1

2

Judge Cox doesn't let you have ’the record and Mr. Satterfield

3

says you don't belong in this Court if you don’t have it.

4

Now, I would like to make a reference to further

5

response to a question asked by Mr. Justice Harlan, about

6

whether the rules proposed here were for one part of the

7

country„

8

The pendente life rule which is what I believe Mr.

3

Justice Harlan had reference to, is particularly appropriate

10

in these cases because here we have substantially or fully

n

matured plans which are capable of being put into effect and

m

have completely — or almost close to completely, carried out

13

the purposes in this Court's decision in Brown as elucidated

by their later decisions.

So, I think that is why1 it is

peculiarly appropriate to reply in this particular case and is
not a sectional suggestion, but one that acts for the circum­
stances here.
How, this country has made immense strides in
eradicating the stigma of slavery since and largely as a result
of this Court's decisions in Brown against Board of Education.
The principle of those cases has been an important one, not
only in theory, but because of actual implementation shows that
‘ this makes motions and stands behind them.
Conversely, a retreat from the principles of Brown,
as well as what that retreat would symbolise, -would tall the

73

country more than many volumes of mere rhetoric about what

the country stands for»
Plessey against Ferguson symbolised the retreat from

the principles of the 14th Amendment.

it is the real issue, whether we shall continue to go forward
or halt.
