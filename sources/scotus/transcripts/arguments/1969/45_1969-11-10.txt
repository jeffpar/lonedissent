MR. BORST:

Court in the Southern District of West Virginia.

The trial was

was invalid.? not reaching the issue by the defendant on

12

account of that adjudication.
The appeal was then made to the Circuit Court of

13
14

Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, in which — before

13

which we had oral argument, and after that the decision was

16

rendered reversing the District Court and remanding it to the

17

District Court for consideration of the infringement issue.

18

\

«*

Stay of that mandate was then granted on Petitioner's

19

request, pending, of course, the determination of the whole

20

matter by this Court.

21

The Neville Patent in the suit basically discloses

22

a street paver.

And suspended from the street paver is a

23

heat generator.

The street paver basically comprises a hopper

24

which receives bituminous material from a truck which has

25

obtained the material from an asphalt plant.

2

A distributor

I

which deposits the material on a

2

vibrating fashion, compacts material on the bad and very often

3
4

a screed which irons or planes the material so as to smooth it
and finally shape the pavement.
The heater which is suspended from the paver in the

Neville patent is not used to — in the operation of the paver
to form the first strip of pavement»

It is used solely when

paving the second strip, which is to be laid in Abutting re­
lation to the first strip.

It functions — the heater functions

to preheat the longitudinal marginal edge of the first strip
«V

that had been laid but which had been allowed to grow cool?
and then the paver itself deposits the asphalt on the roadbed
and against the new -— the preheated edge so as to form a bond
therewith — a union therewith; and to make the so-called cold
joint»
The claims in the suit and we have considered Claim
IV representative, call broadly for a means for laying the
asphalt and means for shaping the pavement.

And that, broadly;

18
19

therefore, covers the paver itself.
The claim goes on to recite a radiant generating

20
means and further, in connection with the radiant energy
21

generating means, that comprises a combustion chamber below a

22
plate of which is perforated.

And through the holes of the

23
24

perforation, or adjacent thereto, propane gases or butane gase;are fired and the plate thereby becomes incandescently ^hfc and

The radiant energy generator in another patent',

is disclosed as far as it is claimed in Sckwank Patent, No.

4

2,775,294,and the Neville specification so states that the

5

radiant energy generator that is disclosed in the Schwank pro­

6

cess is entirely suitable for the patentee’s purposes»
The components of the paver and the components of the

generator are all old elements which is readily conceded by
Respondent.

In reversing the District Court —

Q

A

claims.
In reversing the District Court the Circuit Court of
Appeals commented the steps 'which occupy the attention of the
District Court were narrow ones and went on to make its decision
largely based on the satisfaction of the long-felt need and
eventual acceptance of Neville's concepts by Respondents?
experts who are initially skeptical»
The Court then went on to find that the method of
forming the sorcaliefl cold joint between two asphalt layers of
©02S2?©t© — of highway

previous to Neville, involved the pro­

cess of cutting back the vertical marginal edge and painting
it with asphalt»

23
We feel that both this finding of the Circuit Court
24
of Appeals and the significance to be attached to the experts’
25

.4

1

original skeptability and incredulity, must be weighed in

2

terms of the prior art which is extant at that time.

3

in that art is British Patent Wo. 756911.

Q

'12

13

How much of a prior art constitutes a reliable i

claim — allof it?

14

A

15

I am about to come to.

All of it but the so-called Morccm Patent which

The British patent was cited during the prosecution

10
17

imputed constructively to the

of the Neville application.
This matter of the previous method of forming an edge,

18
19

we feel should be imputed to the patentee himself, who was

20

supposed to have filled a long-felt need and thereby having mads

21

an unobvious discovery as required for patentability under

22

35 US Code 103.
Aside from this, Petitioner believes it would be

23
24

moot

to consides? hese this question of long-felt need or com­

25

mercial success in its function in patent laws with regard to

5

i

?

the determination of the validity or invalidity of patents.

z

Under the decisions there is no question but that this is a

3
4

marginal or peripheral question. This conclusion was explicit
the
expanded by this Court in/ASP versus Supermarket case decided

5

in 1950 and in which it said, and I quote:

6

without invention will not make patentability,"

"Commercial success

The decisions sver the y©ars have said that commer­

7
3

cial success may be used to resolve doubt as to inventions, but

9

not to inject such doubt.

So, therefore, recognising that such

to

a ground as long-felt need is relevant solely on condition that

11

after the usual test of patentability had been conducted, there

12

is genuine doubt as to how to decide the issue invention, we

13

have the really significant question here as to how much

14

importance may be attached to commercial success, when the only

15

evidence of that success that has been adduced by Plaintiff,

16

relates to but one element of the patented combination? that

17

being the radiant energy generator, as claimed, of the Schwank

13

type.

1

The two engineers who testified for Respondent, des' <

20

cribed the benefits and virtues and glories of using a radiant

21

energy generator of the Schwank type to heat up an asphalted

22

edge which was to receive new asphalt in abutting relation.

23

They did not testify as to the success of or the un­

24

expected benefits flowing from the combination paver and heater

25

which is the subject of the claim.

6

It is the combination which

y

1

is the supposed invention, not the heater, per se»

2

The original claims as filed in the Patent Office

3

attempted to claim the heater per se in connection with its

4

use in highway construction»

5

failed to get»

6

for using such a generator, and those claims he failed to get»

7

So, he is now in a position where he can only assert

But those claims they never

n

Q

12

13

It is your position that this is not a com­

bination, rather simply an aggregation?
A

Yes.

I am using the term up until now in a

14

rather nontechnical sense.

15

a connotation or —

When I say combination I mean rather

10

Q

A collection of known ingredients?

17

A

Right.

13

Q

But, technically, it’s your claim that this is

19

an aggregation and I understand your submission is that the law

20

is that a mere aggregation is never patentable? a combination

21

may be patentable if it combines old elements to reach a new

22

and unanticipated result; is that it?

23
24

A

That is our position perfectly stated.

The question, naturally, therefore presents itself as
I
to whether the Respondents' testimony as to commercial
'

25

7

1

successes is even relevant since it goes only to the benefits

2

of one element of an assembly of elements as patented, which

3

is better than any invention in this assembly of old elements.

4

So, let us look at the so-called "narrow issues" and

5

steps which occupy the attention of the District Court.

6

fact,, these issues involve the scope and relevancy of the prior

7

art to this development.

8

the patentee had solved a problem which had hitherto,, essen­

9

tially defied solution.

In

ii

10
11
12

It involved the question as to whethe

And it went into this question of aggregation which
we feel was treated rather cavalierly by the Court below.
The prior right in this case which the Petitioner

13

considers most pertinent, is the British patent which I pre­

14

viously alluded to: the Morcum Patent, Mo. 709,014 was issued

15

in 1905 and, of course, the Schwank Patent which was the

16

radiant energy generator used on the Neville Paver.

17

Morcum refers to the basic problem of causing new

18

asphalt to unite with old asphalt in place in road patching.

19

And what is Marcum's solution?

20

same as Neville's; namely: the use of radiant energy.

21

dent has never tried to contend throughout the trial or the

22

appeals that road patching in this regard presents any problem

23

which differs essentially from road construction; there being

24

in each case a question of how to get new asphalt, which is hot

25

asphalt, to unite with old asphalt which has been allowed to

claims except that the British street paver meets the marginal

8

is not so denominated in the British patent of the radiant

9

energy heater, but as Judge Haynesworth in the Fourth Circuit

„

state that radiant energy prepares the cold
is less likely to scox'ch it, than say, an.

The British patent shares everything that Neville

It

10

Court stated, it is a radiant energy heater since it comprises a

11

combustion chamber which permits and which provides for the

12

firing of gaseous materials within and an escape or discharge

13

opening, causing the bottom of the heater to raise its tempera­

14

ture and therefore, of necessity, become a source of radiant

15
16

17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24

25

heat.

From a scientific point of view, any body, in fact, which

has a temperature in excess of absolute zero degrees, is a
source of radiant heat.
The same way it would seem that if radiant heat was
desirable as suggested by Morcum, such a heater of any type
could be obviously substituted for the radiation heater in the
British claim, without making invention.
Schwank, as explained, shows the heater as that com­
ponent as claimed in Neville, and that patent,

an faet

mentioned in the Neville Patent as disclosing a heater which is
suitable for the patentee's purposes.
9

The District Court went on to discuss this question

of aggregation.

experts and certainly Petitioner's expert have agreed that the
paver operates entirely independently of the heater and the
heater operates independently of the paver; therefore, the
heater functions in precisely the same manner whether the tampec
tamper is being — for example, is being operated, or whether
the distributor is actually laying the material; or whether the
screed is there to smooth the material.
This is an unquestioned fact, as well, that the

10

It
12
13

14

There is no question here and Respondent's

heater is, in constructing the adjoining roadblocks of a single
lane, is removed from the paver and is placed on a separate
mobile support and used to make the transverse edge of the two
adjoining highway blocks in a single lane of highway.
In dispensing this whole question this Court, in

15

deciding the Lincoln Engineering case, which is heavily relied
16

upon in its briefs and petitions, found that at least one
17
definition of aggregation was that the total must, somehow
18
— total of the old elements, must somehow exceed the sum of
19

the parts.

And in finding that the system there disclosed,

20
which was a system for injecting grease into the beamings of an
21

automobile which included a pison pump and a conduit connecting
22
.— communicating therewith and a coupling consisting of jaws,
23

were aggregated.
24

The Cclurt makes at that time an observation which
25

10

1
n

£m

we think is peculiarly applicable to the situation here.

The

Court in perhaps an overture, suggested that if the patentee

3

had addressed his claims to the jaws per se, he might have

4

found himself with a valid patent, but in fact, he did not and

5

6

then by fee time this patent got before this Court, it was, of
course, too late to do that.
It might be of interest to this Court to note that

7

8
9
10
11

there are several cases in Great Britain which deal with the
subject of aggregation which have not been brought to its
attention in the brief and I thought I might do it now, if the
Court would indulge me.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

12
13
14

Could you supply them to us

by memorandum at the close of your argument, as well?

You may

discuss the cases now but supply the citations.
MR. BORST:

15

Yes, sir.

One case is the famous and classic Sausage Machine

16

case which was decided by the Chancery Division of the High
17

Court of Appeals in the 13909s -— in 1890.

In that case the

18

meat grinder ground the sausage meat and then the filling
19

machine was placed somehow in communication with the grinder

20
so that that machine filled the sausage skin with the ground
21

meat.

The High Court of Appeals, Chancery Division, stated feha

22
while it must be recognised that something new and useful was
23

done here, the fact is that the two components operate so in-'
24

dependently of one another, from the standpoint of function anc,
25

11

t

are, in fact, separate from one another from the standpoint of

2

structure, that the claims to the two elements are aggregated

3

and therefore, invalid,

I am not enough of a patent lawyer to knew how

5

similar or how different it is, the British lav; of patents from

our law, or the British law of 1890 from our law of 1969,

14

That is true.

Celanase Limited versus Plutos(?) with Lord Tomlin speaking for
the Court, made this definition of aggregation, which I think
can be accepted by American Courts today.
quote:

And he said, and I

"It is accepted as sound law that a mere placing side

by side, of old integers so that each performs its own proper
function independently of any of the others, is not a patentable
combination? but that where the old integers when placed to­
gether have some working- interrelation, produces a new and
improved result, then there is patentable subject matter in the

15

idea of the working interrelation brought about by the collo­

16

cation of the integers.

17

The first case that 1 cited can be foimd — that is

Williams versus Nye in 7rpc 62; rpc being an acronym for report

Were there any findings by the Court here that

were placed together; the generator or the heater on top, was

aggregation it was discussing that problem because there is

exactly and precisely the same way e whether they are put to­

were on different mobile supports.

that the District Court dealt with narrow issues.

With what?

A

Harrow steps or issues.

I was about to give the citation the Chief Justice
asked for for the case in the House of Lords in 1935, namely:
Celanese verbs Pluto's.

That may be found in 52 rpc 171,

particularly noting Page 193.
We have always, contended — not always, but later­
ally contended in this case that this suit could also be de­
cided on the question of exhaustive combinations: a combination
which has been — old elements which have been previously
patented may not be repatented merely because one has improved
one of the elements of that combination.

And that may be

exemplified by saying that if one improves a spark plug or a
carbueretor he9 s not entitled to reclaim the engine block and

15

1

steering apparatus and the windshield wipers and the safety

2

belts that go together to make up the combination which we know

in an automobile„

Judges Haynesworth and

it made perfectly clear what the evidence shows.

X would like

to develop that evidence with you a little bit further as I go
forward.

Pardon me.

It seems to me that that last

paragraph is not a finding but a conclusionof law.
A

We.’x*3 into this area? Your Honor? where it has

been debated back and forth whether these are findings or
conclusions.

a finding of fact.

In this case X do not think —

But finding it's invalid? that's not a finding

Ho? Your Honor.

Invalidity is plainly a legal

conclusion; obviousness is a factual matter to be determined

upon the evidence in the record.

Well? in the sentences that follow at Page 25?

As you get into these discussions of the evidence

in your own mind, Mr. Blenko, your statement in Judge Craven's

Harlan's question, right in the first paragraph.

patentable, though for all we know, the same desired result may

16

be achieved by two machines juxtaposed and separately propelled.

17

That, as I say, is one specific aspect, rather dramatically, I

18

would suppose, of presenting the issue as to whether or not this

19

combination is simply the known and expectable result of a

20

combination of old ingredients, or whether there is one in which

21

the result exceeds the sum of its parts.

The material is in the record.

primarily to the last page of the Defendant’s volume where

together?

In our submission the Court of Appeals did not

What if it had?

17

A

I think then that it would plainly be-wrong.

14
15

say that.

13

But I don't think is the case which arises upon this record.

19

Let me see if I can develop that a little bit.
i

20

First, of all, there are several matters here which ±

21

think are beyond dispute if you look at the record, as distin­

22

guished from arguments and contentions of counsel.

23

all, Neville did create a new combination of elements.

24

look through the entire record and you will not find Neville's

25

combination anyplace in the prior art.

22

First of
You can

I think that the most

1

telling comment upon that was again in the testimony of Mr.

2

Quail, who was Aeroil's Vice President and at Page 40, 41 and

3

42~A in the printed Appendix I asked him where he found the

4

elements of the Neville patent, and he said: "You will have to

5

look to all in order to find it."

of prior art in numbers, so he had to look to

to find the Neville Patent.

14
15

this combination was not an. obvious one.

It showed a complete difference between the

combination of the patent in the suit and what had been done
before that time.
Now, this brings me to what is the essential point,
and that is: the elimination of the cold joint.

This arises

when you lay two lanes of asphalt, bituminous, blacktop, what™
ever you like to call it? the sort of thing we sea on the
ordinary highway.

Mien you lay them side by side you almost

invariably lay one Xaha and then bring another lane and Jay it
alongside later.
The inventor was an individual; he was one of these
men that the patent system, I think, may be said to be designed
to encourage and protect; he was not a part of any organization
He concedes that if you put on a radiant energy at the joint
area as you lay the second abutting course that then you would /
eliminare this cold joint where you never had a1really good
matching or marriage, as they call it, between the two mats
which had been laid down. Arid he went around the established
people and ha tried to make his point with them and got nowhere
He finally got backing from a layman who didn't know much about

it either, but who was sold; and they went to work; and they

2

now managed to bring their system forward and show that this is

3

a real and a workable scheme.

Q

Do you have to apply the radiant energy at the

time you put the pieces together?

A

Yes, Your Honor.

That is what you call — that you consider to

8

be the new discovery?

A

Yes.

that.

Now, the point I make from that is this?

If this

plan is so elaborate it certainly is an easy thing to avoid
infringement by changing a few of these details and you can
make some much more radical changes in trying to mount these on
two separate chassis,

You can still stay on one chassis, but

you can certainly avoid infringement very easily? they don't
do it.

And the reason is, of course, that there is no

s trates invention.
Now, speaking again very broadly, without going into

3
4

the details of the claim language, there are three elements

5

which we have talked about for convenience, and these are the

6

asphalt or bituminous spreader and then the street element which

7
8

9

shapes it and you also have the radiant energy generator which
bears on the previously laid lane and which makes it receptive
for the asphalt which is being laid alongside.
So, as the machine goes down the highway, you have

17

to one side, a previously laid lane of asphalt.

is running beside that?“the radiant energy generator is directing the radiant energy onto the existing lane of asphalt; and
then a new lane of asphalt is laid alongside.

And because you

do have the radiant energy you get your marriageof the two
lanes and you avoid this cold joint and everything that that
entails.
The problems that arise from that are set forth in

Reference has been made here to the Morcum Patent,

and I want to say at once that you will find very little about

it in the record because Morcum was really not the thrust of

the defense in the trial court; it just came along for the ride ,

10

The primary reference has simply been abandoned at this point,

11

so you won't find very much testimony on Morcum.

12

The testimony that is there is that it won’t work.

13

And it won't work because it’s different from what is claimed

in the patent.

That's part of it, yes; there's one more step.

There's one more step and you say that it was

I think that that does carry

I would like, if I may, ; simply to restate

that fact in my own terms.

I think it is essentially what you

said.
The three sections tothe statute to which we look in
28

?

these matters, have been discussed most recently by this Court

2

in Graham against John Deere and United States against Adams.

3

Those are Sections 101 and 102 and 103.

4

to state my understanding of them, itwsuld be this:

If I may be presumed

That Section 1 requires that there be an invention

It is not

The mere fact that you

claim two things dees not mean that you have any combination
or legal invention.

So, as I say, that is the Section 101

defense»
Section 102 defense is the defense of lack of novelty.

15
18
17

19

I think the defense of aggregation really is statu­

Q

Is what?

A

Lack of novelty.

Q

Lack of novelty?

A

Yes.

^

The problem rs that no one has ever

found an affirmative definition of invention.

I think that

.

20
21
22

23
24
25

comes from its nature because it’s always pushing into the
unknown.

After we know the invention, it3s very easy to have

20/20 hindsight and see all about it, but at the time the in­
vention is made and we are all reaching forward, it's a dif­
ferent matter.

So, we always end up putting this in the nega­

tive sense: novelty is not present if
29

the following:

i

j

All righto

4

invention, then you have a Section 102 defense.

7

And finally,

we get to 101 and 102? you have the Section 103 hurdle which
is: was it an obvious invention claim?
And I think, in essence, this is the restating of

5

6

If disclosed in the prior art the exact

the way you had it, but I thought it might be helpful to re­
state it in my own language.
Q

3

I take it you rely rather strongly on the

testimony of the military engineer who dealt with the laying of
9
10

asphalt pavement on airports.
A

11
12
13
14

I certainly rely upon his testimony; I also

rely upon the testimony of Mr. Witkowski who was a former head
ofthe Research Laboratory in the Pennsylvania Highway Depart­
ment .
Q

And you say that neither — that there is no

15

testimony in this total record which disputes their ^statement
16

\
that this was not an obvious invention?

17

A

None whatsoever; no such testimony at all, any­

18

place in the record.
19

I do know of some other testimony which goes the other
20
way .-and that. testimony is of the Defendant's equipment foreman.
21

And even at the time of the trial he said, "Well, I'm not quite
22
sure why we do this, but we do it."

Now, here's the man who's

23

actually out in the field, who I think is the skilled worker in
24

the art; even then he hadn't been able to see it.
25

30

shows a complete lack of obviousness»
Now, I wanit to say one word very briefly about the

2
3
4
5

6

7

cases which have been referred tolls re by the Petitioners.
They have referred primarily to Lincoln Engineering against
Stewart-Warner.

I think all of the other cases which they

have cited are of the same stripe and they all stand or fall
on the same proposition.
I think that Lincoln Engineering against Stewart-

8

Warner is entirely in accord? Graham against John Deere,
9
U. S. v. Adams and the decision of the Court of Appeals in this
10

case.
11

In short, I think the decisions in the patent field
12
are about as consistent as the decisions you will find in any
13

/'•

body of law.

.

I don’t think they are inconsig-tent at all.
