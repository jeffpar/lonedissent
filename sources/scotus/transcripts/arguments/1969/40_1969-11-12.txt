ORAL ARGUMENT BY CHARLES S. RALSTON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6
7

MR. RALSTON: Thank you, Your Honor.

8

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

9

This case is on a writ of certiorari to review the denial by

10

the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the

11

Ninth Circuit of an application for a certificate of probable

12

cause to appeal from the denial petition for writ .of habeus

13

corpus.
The Federal District Court had denied the petition

14
15

on the merits without requiring either a response from the

16

Respondents here and without hearing.

17

grounds that the petition failed to present a Federal Constitu­

13

tional question and the certificate for probable cause was

19

denied by both courts on the same grounds.
Petitioner in this case, James Conway, wasconvicfcad

It was denied on the

in California in 1952 on two counts of robbery in the first
degree.

by the State of California under the provisions of the Califor­
nia Indeterminate Sentence Law.

tod it is this law and

Petitioner’s challenges to them that are at issue in this case.
2

\

not only the law itself, but the manner in which it has been

2

administered by the California Adult Authority, the Respondent

3

in -this case.

4

Petitioner claims on a number of bases that the law

5

and the manner in which it is administered, violates tha 14th

@

Amendment's guarantees against tha denial of due process.

7

Before discussing Petitioner's contentions themselves, I'd like

3

briefly to describe the functioning of the Adult Authority and

9

the California Indeterminate Sentencing Law in relation to the

10

particular facts of Petition's case ss ha has alleged them in

11

his petition for writ of habeas corpus. ;
I stated before. Petitioner was convicted in 1952 on

12
13

two counts of robbery in the first degree.

14

conviction, Petitioner was sentenced to state prison and in

IS

doing this, the Court neither gave him a suspended sentence or

16

gave him probation.

18

pended sentence was denied.

19

visions of Section 1203 of the California Penal Code that at

20

that, time the Superior Court Judge was prohibited from granting

21

probation.

22

contained.a prohibition against probation in certain kinds of

23

cases, among them: armed robbery where e deadly weapon is used.

24
25

Following this

Now, parenthetically, it is not evident, at

It might have been under the pro­

That section, particularly as it existed in 1952,

In any event, since no probation or suspended sen­
tence was given, the judge's action was governed by California

Authority may determine and redetermine what length of time

56

a person shall be imprisoned.

7
58

20
21

Yet. another section of the Penal Cods, Section 577
delineates the two basic powers of the Adult Authority,

The

granting and revocation of parole, which is not involved in
this case and the fixing of sentences, which is the issue here.
Petitioner, following his sentence by the court,

22

following his imprisonment, made a number of appearances before

however, no terra whatsoever was set by the Superior Court' Judge
Q

B

I might

Again,

Mr. Ralston, if you know, is it usual for the

S

Adult Authority to come in at a point and fisc a sentence, the "

7

way it was done here, generally?

8

9
10

A

Well,, under the statute it has the duty to do

Q

Yes.

so»
I understand they have the power and the

u

duty is --- is there any pattern that is reflected as when that

12

power is exercised?

1.3

A

I do not have any specific information as to

14

at what point this power is exercised.

15

that these terras are, in fact, set at some point during the

16

person's stay in prison, particularly to deal with once the

17

minimum term is going to be served.

18

I could not say.

19

It is ray understanding

As to exactly the pattern,

Petitioner has claimed in his petition for habeas

20

corpus that he believes the reason the Adult Authority did not

21

act before it did was that he had refused to confess guilt to

22

the crimes for which he was punished, convicted.

23

Q

That, apparently, is challenged here?

24

A

Mo, I do not believe the Attorney General has

25

challenged his contention about the initial fixing.

5

The

i

Attorney General has challenged that the revocation of that

2

fixing was based on his later refusal, .but Petitioners also

•J

allega that he believes that. Adult Authority did not sat his

4

sentence prior to 1959 because ha had consistently refused,

5

every time he came up before the Adult Authority, to admit that

6

he was guilty of the crime.

7

say,

8

five-year sentences at a minimum.

It was only when ha did in 1959

"I am guilty,” that they then set the term at the two

9

Now, as to what the general practice is of the Adult

10

Authority, this record does not reflect it and on itself, I am

1?

not sura what the specific practice is.
Q

12

Well, unless.we know the factual basis for that

action how can we know that we have a Federal question here?

13

A

14

Well, the problem in this case, Mr. Justice

15

Douglas, is that there is, in essence, no record in this case.

16

All there is is the petition for writ of habeus corporas. And

IT

it's because of the lower court’s statement that there is no

18

Federal question presented at all by the challenge to the actio;

19

jOf the Ad hit Authority, and the dismissal on that basis' did not

20

require a response from the Attorney General; no response was

21

filed.

There is no stated; it was simply denied on its face.
The basic contention here is that at the least there

22
.}

S3

should be a remand to the lower court in order so that the

24

facts can be developed to findout what, in fact, the California

25

Adult Authority did do in Petitioner’s case, and also :<
6

1

the Attorney General made the first time in this Court con­

cerning practices and procedures»

3

The .unfortunate thing about this case is that there

4

is no record because of the attitude of the Lower Court towards

5

challenges to the Adult Authority.

6

thatthe Adult Authority is insulated from constitutional

7

challenge; that the state can set up this system and they can

Q

It simply, in a sense, says

The state says you ran out of time in the Court

of Appeals; is that so?
A

No, Your Honor, we feel the state has basically

13

misconstrued the Federal habeas corpus act requirements.

14

clear from the record that the Petitioner did file in the

15

District Court, an application for certificate of probable

He then attempted

The Ninth Circuit, Judge Chambers,

treated the certificate of probable cause on its merits and

warranted by the Habeas.Corpus Act or the Federal Rules or

Federal statutes.

Q

The crucial thing is that something showing —

Otherwise the whole

Well,, technically at least, all we have here its

10

the denial of a certificate of probable cause by Chief Judge

11

Chambers; is that correct?

12

A

Yes, sir.

It's the same situation as House

1.3

versus Mayo, where the Court decided that the denial for

14

petition of probable cause for error and they sent the case bach

15

down to the District Court, for determination on the merits.

2!

Q

That would be about 2241 or 2242?

99

A

—I think it’s clear from such cases as House

23

versus Mayo that certiorari does widen the denial of the cer­

24

tificate of probable cause itself.

Whyis that?

For a certificate and ifthat’s

there is authority then to apply to a justice, Circuit Justice
or another Justice, that would be the way to proceed.
A

1?

Quite frankly, 1 have not looked into the

12

specific matters.

I believe, however, that it is proper to go

13

on writ of certiorari from the denial of the certificate of

14

probable cause itself? that a new application for certificate

15

of probable cause from a Circuit Justice is not required and

16

does not divest this Court of jurisdictionover certiorari.

17

Q

But I think you have some cases on your side.

18

A

1 believe that in the case of Maxwell versus

19

Bishop as I recall, by appearances, this was the situation.

Yes.

And then ha

He should have gone to the Court of

Well, he attempted to do that.

His affidavit

states that he had tried to file appropriate papers to show his

17
18

intention to appeal in the Court of Appeals within the time,

1©

but this had been blocked by the actions of the state prison

20

authorities, who had taken away his papers.
Q

21

But, nevertheless, the proper procedure was to

ask the Court of Appeals for a certificate of probable cause.'

22

A

23

Yes, Your Honor.

And Judge Chambers treated the

affidavit he filed as that.

24

Q

25

i

But in any event you would say that he

i

eventually did do that and you wcjuld. say there isn't any time

Isn't what happens when you get a certificate

of probable cause, then there is an appeal?

?

Then there must be some

Yes, sir,
So that what you are really saying is that

you're going to have to protect an appeal and I would suppose

10

that the appellant time limits might be relevant as to when you

n

have to get organized to get the certificate of probable cause,

12

A

Yes, Your Honor,

Again, the Third Circuit set

^3

down no specific guidelines as to how long a lapse might be,

14

but again, looking at the facts inthis situation, there was

IS

action within the 30 days and every effort was made by

16

Petitioner, who again was sitting in prison, acting on his own

1?

to get the things filed in the Court of Appeals on time and was

18

blocked, according to his affidavit, by actions of the state.

19

It was perfectly proper for the Chief Judge of the

20

Ninth Circuit to accept that as a certificate of probable

21

cause and deny it on the merits? that's what he did.

22

Mow, in June of 1961, line months before Petitioner's

23

discharge date would have been set. Petitioner appeared for

24

what he alleges was an annual parole hearing.

25

what he planned to do when he was released and he said he v/ishec
11

He was asked

1
2
3
4

S
7
8
9
to
11

12

to return to Bakersfield to fight his case»

At this point,,

according to Petitioner, objections were raised to his doing
this and mention was made for the first time of extending his
term to allow for a longer period of supervisional parole.
Petitioner declined and said he wished to stay wifc.v
his previously set sentence and serve it and be released.
Then subsequently, at some later time, not revealed by this
record, the Adult Authority revoked the two five-year terms,
with the effect of resentenging Petitioner to two consecutive
life terms.
Petitioner contends in this factual context that his
rights to due process as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment have
been violated in a number of respects.

First, he urges that

13
14

IS

the California Adult Authority has been given the broad and
sweeping power to sentence and resentence, uncircuivtscrihed by
any standards-for controlled or specific procedures.

That is,

16
it has an arbitrary power which, he claims, is in fact, exer­
17
!8
19
20

cised in Petitioner’s case, by revoking its prior determination
and resentencing

in essence, resentencing Petitioner for an

invalid reason.
From this argument, Petitioner urges that the lack, of

21
either standards or cons tifcutionally~adequate procedures permite

22
the Adult Authority to revoke and refix for invalid reasons and
23

essentially prohibits Petitioner from effectively influencing
24
and bringing to bear onthe determination of the Adult Authority
23

12

1

those considerations which properly go intothe fixing of the

2

sentence»

3

Petitioner, in the second major argument, urges that

4

the re fixing of the sentence, once set and begun, to be served,

6

violated Petitioner's rights under the double jeopardy clause,

6

as it applies to the states by virtue of the 14th Amendment.

7

Mow, returning to Point 1 of Petitioner»

8

that this case is governed in its essentials by this Court's

9

decisions in a number of decisions in a number of cases, in­

He contends

10

cluding Tovmsend versus Burke, Mempa versus Rhay and North

11

Carolina versus Pearce, which was decided in the last term of

12

this Court,

These cases and others establish beyond the

question the requirements of the due"" process clause due to
1.3

15
IS
17
18

19
20

21
22
23
24

25

apply to the sentencing function.
How, what the State of California has done in this
case, is to transfer a substantial and' significant portion of
that sentencing function from the judge to an administrative
agency, the California Adult Authority,

But, its doing so,

does not, therefore, divest that function of these constitu­
tional protections»
These protections, as set out in the cases I
mentioned, involve a number of things,

Mempa, for instance,

involved a statutory schema quite similar to California where
the judge was required to sentence to the maximum term but the
actual fixing of the sentence was done by a board.
13

The Court
i

!

there, although it recognized that the sentencing judge’s

2

functions had been circumscribed;, said neverthless, the basic

*<5

constitutional protection must apply to even what the judge

4

did, which was simply to gather information to pass on to the

5

board which would make its eventual determination.

6

It would seem to follow, necessarily, that these

1

same protections would adhere to the board itself when it makes

8

the determination it doss.

3

addition to those involved directly in Mempa, is that not in­

10

creasing or even originally setting a sentence for an improper

n

reason.

12

And among these protections, in

And Petitioner has contended and seeks to show that

13

there was, in fact, an improper reason for the Adult Authority’s

14

action in his case.

IS
16

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think probably, Mr.

Ralston, that is your warning light.

17

THE MARSHAL:

He asked to be notified —

IS

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

13

MR. RALSTON;

I see.

That, to, in essence, revoke the

20

previous sentence and put a prisoner back on life term merely

21

because he wishes to prove his innocence once he gets out,

22

flies in the face of the rules and decisions of this Court, and

23

again for instance, in the Pearce case, where an analogous

24

situation this Court made it clear that the state could not

26

impose conditions such as increasing the sentence on a
14

1

Petitioner's trying to fight his case in another means, to

2

appeal for habeas corpus.

3

It might be noted.in this case that there is no

4

indication of what the Adult Authority meant when it did not

5

want Petitioner to fight his case.

6

Authority can stand it could very well set out and enforce a

7

rule that a person who did not admit — completely subject

8

himself to the Adult Authority, even to the extent of giving up

9

any rightsto legal process, would not be let out or if a term

10
11
12

3

If the action of the Adult

was set, would- be revoked and increased.
Further, Petitioner contends that because States of
California has granted the kind of arbitrary powers as to the
Adult Authority, that its actions must be circumscribed by

14

adequate procedures so that the reasons and bases for its

15

actions appear and so that, again, the Petitioner can adequately

10

bring to bear whatever considerations he feels are necessary

7
10

9
20
21

for the Adult Authority's decisions»

These procedures, again

on the basis of this record, do not exist.

Certainly nothing

like the procedures of protection when a judge in a Court Trial
sentences and determines the sentence, are here.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER3

Would you concede, Mr.

%

22

Ralston, that in this kind of sentencing scheme or system, thfifc

23

some considerable flexibility must be allowed to the State to

2/1

deal with it.

25

cedural devices to protect it?

Is that your point, that you claim it needs pro­

5

1

A

Yes, Your Honor,

Flexibility is one thing, but.

£

arbitrariness is another.

And in order that i axibility can be

3

preserved in such a system with sufficient protection so that

4

the sentencing board does not just do anything it feels like

S

doing.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

6

If I read your briefs

7

accurately, my impression is that you say once having fixed it

8

they never can increase it; is that right?
A

8

This is the second part of the argument which

to

is an independent from the first part.,

11

and then I would — unless there are any other questions, I

12

would like to reserve the remainder of my.time for rebuttal,

13

is that a line of casas; a long line of cases in this Court and

14

in virtually every Circuit Court has held that once a sentence

15

has been set and fixed, and begun to be served, cannot then be

16

reset, except Pearce allows an exception where the reason to

17

sentence no longer exists because an appeal had been taken and

IS

won.

19

sentence may be set.

£0

there has been no appeal; sentence has not been set aside; it

21

is the same sentence and Petitioner contends that double

22

jeopardy clause prohibits the resetting of it to a higher amount

23

after it has been set.

24

Q

£5

And that, very briefly,

Then, under certain circumscribed situations the longer

Authority he was asked where he would go if released on dis­
charge and Petitioner replied to Bakersfield and then sub­
sequently they began discussing about why — about increasing
the parole and at the bottom of the paragraph it says:
Obviously/the only reason for this- action was to coerce Pefci' tioner to plead guilty and not challenge the conviction after
being released on discharge.
Q

Yes, it is vague and uncertain to the extent that it grants the

that the sentence is vague and uncertain.
