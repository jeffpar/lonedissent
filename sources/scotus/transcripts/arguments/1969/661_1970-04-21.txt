This spring line was secured around her winch. They

We believe: that argument is sound.

Our position is — as stated in the Larsen Case and

quoted in my brief amicus — that:

21

it will grant its nationality to a merchant ship, thereby

accepting responsibility for it and acquiring authority over

it.”

is important.

in it that would prevent this trial in this country?

No, the Jones Act, Your Honor, has been inter­

two sections were originally enacted — I believe it was
a shipping act of 1916 or maybe a little earlier --- they were
in general terms such as the Jones Act.

The courts construed

both those sections - in the first instance, as

not applying

either to advances made in a foreign port or to foreign ships.
At that point both sections were amended specifically
to apply to foreign vessels.

Consequently, cases like Strathern

against Dillon read that -the Congress had the power to apply
a statute to foreign vessels.

What has the power?

advances to foreign vessels.

When those

The reason for that is this:

Q

Were there any bills introduced in the Congress

following Lauritzen or Romero?
A

5

Mo; there were not.

Let me say this:

that 1

6

think there is a good reason based on the language of Mr.

7

Justice Jackson in the Lauritsen Case.

8

the shipping laws of this country, which are contained in Title

9

46, are many, and, of those, very few are specific in their

He pointed out that

10

language, in their application, either to American or foreign

11

shipping operations.
This is what he said about that:

12

"Many give no

13

evidence that Congress addressed itself to their foreign

14

application and are in general terms, which leave their

15

application to be judicially determined from context and

16

circumstance."
He decided that, where Congress has bean silent, the

17
18

courts, not only may, but they must speak on what they mean.

19

And then, with reference specifically >10 the Jones Act, he

20

said that, "Congress could not have been unaware of the

21

necessity of construction imposed upon courts by such generality

22

of language anc was well-warned that, in the absence of more

23

definite directions than are contained in the Jones Act, it

24

25

would

be applied by the courts to foreign events, ships and

foreign seamen in accordance with the usual doctrines and
38

1

practices of maritime law."
So,, apparently, Congress felt that the courts must

and are able to determine in each case whether there are

4

sufficient contacts with, the United States, as weighed by the

3

7-factor Lauritzer. test, to warrant or justify the application

6

to foreign transactions or not»
In effect, it has not been necessary for Congress

7
8

to legislate on that.

I think it would even be dangerous for

9

Congress to legislate on that.

Because these shipping oper­

14

The scrambled types of transactions — of which we

15

have a wonderful example here — are just typical.

16

be very difficult for Congress to comprehend in one act some­

17

thing that would slice the law in between a bona fide foreign

18

operator, like Mr. J. Lauritzen of Denmark — who has always,

19

incidentally, been a Danish domiciliary — and an operator like

Let me, if I may, dwell on the Tsakonites decision.

4

As Your Honors, I believe, have been made aware, this case

comes to you on a conflict between the circuits»

6

Court decided, on identical facts, that the Jones Act did not

7

apply.

3
9

The Tsakonites

Incidentally, with regard to what I contend is a
flag of convenience:

I would be the first to say that, if Mr.

10

Callimanopoulos had just recently come over here and then,

ii

only temporarily, to get started a United States office as

12

merely a small branch to a Greek office and there were a

13

continued and uninterrupted use of Greek flags as part of &

14

principal business in Greece — which is not the case — then

15

even I would say that a court of the United States would be

16

stretching matters rather far to brand his flags as flags of

17

convenience.

18

But, whereas here, there is an overwhelming pre­

19

ponderance cf contact with the United States, as I have out­

20

lined, and corporate registry in Panama, it is obvious that,

21

what tills man is doing is dictated by convenience.

22

If the Court is prepared to say that, even under these

23

circumstances, such a flag is a bona fide flag, then I would

24

conclude that the United States has become fair game, to a

25

certain extent, for economic parasites to incrust themselves
40

1
2

like barnacles in the hull of our maritime commerce.
But getting to Tsakonites:

In Tsakon.if.es the basis

3

of the decision was — I beg your pardon; I meant to say that

4

no case has really set forth guide lines as to what determines

5

whether a flag is one of convenience or not.

S

had no difficulty, for instance, in saying that, where American

7

citizens domiciled here and operating ships from here have gone

8

shopping abroad in the foreign market place of flags and

9

gotten a foreign flag, that such a flag is obviously not a good

On the ether hand, where it is foreign citizens with

I think I have a couple of minutes,,
