ORAL ARGUMENT BY MRS. LOUISE KORNS, ASSISTANT

6

DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

7

MRS. KORNS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

3

Courts

Just to briefly recap the factual situation here.

d

Three New Orleans police officers went to 1826 R street in

80

New Orleans bearing two arrest warrants for Donald Vale,, in­

18

volving prior narcotic crimes«,
Now, the officers wanted to be sure that the accused:

12

13

was at the address before serving these warrants.

They knew

14

that Mrs. Vale, his mother and his brother Donald lived there

15

and they didn't want to alert Donald, ana have'him .take-off

16

again.

17

So, they parked their car about a half a block from
S
the house and watched it and they saw, about 15 minutes;later

18

they saw a transaction take place-between a man associate who

19

approached the house in the car and Donald Vale, who came out
'

>

20

of the house, and, apparently, sold narcotics to this man in

21

the car.

22

and associate; Donald Vale as he was «*- got close to going

23
I

24
23

So, they approached the car, arrested Donald Vale

back in his house.
.

They arrested them for possession of narcotics.
Meanwhile, they had seen as they approached, had seen the man
28

put something in his mouth and swallow it, which to experience
narcotics officers,like this, just meant one thing; that he
was swallowing narcotics.
So, after they arrested the man in the car and
Donald Vale, they frisked them briefly and found•nothing on
thesis no weapons, no narcotics, and then the police officers,
the record shows, told Donald Vale that they were going to
go in and search his house, the.door to which he had left
open in coining out to make this sal©,, to find the narcotics
that they were sure were the source- of this supply that he had
passed on to his associate.
.Thereupon, they watered.the house.

Shortly there­

after, within minutes thereafter, Mrs. Vale and Donald's
brother, James, entered the house and the police offleers
informed them also that they were going to make this search.
And then, within five or ten minutes, in the back bedroom,
which appeared to be a man's bedroom, the police officers
testified they found the heroin and dilaudid they were seeking
in the coat, several coats hanging in a clothes locker.
The S ate of Louisiana believes that following the
legal arrsst, which clearly took place here in front of the
house, the police

officers were entitled to make an inciden­

tal search.
Q

Was the arrest legal because of the capias that

the officers had, or was it legal because of what they had

t

seen?

2

HRS. KORNS:

3

don't rely on those.capiases.

4

that they stayed out of the pictura as far as this search went,.

S

What they had seen, Mr. Justice.

We

The State of Louisiana feels

They only say that adding probable cause for the

0

warrantless arrest, because they were for narcotics offenses

7

which had occurred a couple weeks before, and moreover, at

0

least one of these three officers had been involved, the'

9

record shows, in those prior arrests.

10

And the record also shows that at least one or more

SI

of these officers had not only arrested Donald Vale, either

12

had been connected with these prior arrests, or were familiar

13

with these narcotics, knew Saucier, the man to whom he"was

14

apparently selling, knew that this house was lived in by Mrs.

15

Vale and Donald's brother James.

16

knew that.

20

The scord shows that; they

So, the State of Louisiana Is not relying at all on
these capiases forth!3 arrest, but only on this warrantless
arrest, which took place before the house.
Now, the evidence shows that the police officers

21

didn’t know who was in that house when they arrested Donald

22

and Saucier out in front.

23

vary concerned with the idea that at this very moment, either

24

Mrs. Vale or brother James, or Donald’s girl friend, who

at that very time getting — either hiding the narcotics,

2

taking them out the back door, disposing of them in some way, ;

3

So, as Louisiana sees it, there ;■?as the dilemma

4

faced by these officers, and they either had to seise this

8

evidence right now or not at all, because I know yesterday the!

6

Court was posing a problem of whether there were any alterna­

7

tives to an immediate warrantless search.

9

alternatives, because of the time involved in getting a war-

And, as a practical•

had to enter the house and search it. fairly thoroughly to find

out even whether someone else was in the house, because con­

14

federates often hide in closets and under beds, as this Court

15

knows, and it was only by a fairly thorough search of the hous-b

that the officers could even determine that there was no one

Do you think they were entitled at that point to

A

Well, actually, 1 think the question of violenace!

I guess, is always lurking in the background, but with

narcotics addicts, generally I don’t think weapons are gen­

that they would be shot at from the house of anything.

20

think their primary and only purpose was to try to get ahold

23

of the narcotics which they were convinced they had just seen

22

Donald Vale sell, because of Saucier swallowing that evidence

23

But that right there, if Saucier hadn’t swallowed the

evidence, they would have arrested Vale for this present nar­

There is no. testimony at all on

for, say, burglary suspects, or people who commit crimes of

will show, maybe, that they were frisking them for the

possibility of weapons or narcotics.

A

That's right? the thing is that they didn’t know
33

i

that, though? Mr. Justice, until they had gone all through the

2

house to be sure .

3

there and then, of course, when Mrs. Vale and James showed up,;

within about five minutes after the officers got in the house

but before they had found the narcotics.

14

But, 1 think by that time they had gone through the

house enough to be sure that nobody was in the house.

But

they didn't know this until they got in.

son who could have been hiding in there• was Donald's girl

Q

And the fact I'S: there was nobody «si the' house.

A

The fact is there was nobody, but they had no

way of knowing it.

And, as a matter of fact, as I say, the

record shows that they possibly knew that somebody could be
tli® re.

Now,

15

the State of Louisiana just wants to pose to

this Court the practical difficulties involved if the police
16

\1

were going to get a warrant to search for this narcotic
evidence„

m
29

20

As I said, they first had to get into the house to be
sure no one was hiding in there, ©r it would have done no good
to put a cordon around, the house without first finding out that

2!
there was nobody in it.

22
Having found out that the only two people in it were
23
James, and Mrs. Vale, then they would have had to call other

24
police officers to keep these people under'surveillance —

search warrant in about six duplicates.

Police officers don't

reduce probable cause to writing with the greatest of speed.
It's been my experience these men often have all kinds of
\

}

\

' i

reasons why they do things.

They are not the most articulate j

people in the world, particularly when they have to write

13
down, and often in the past, they used to put down too little, !

14
but now because court decisions throw out warrants, they put

15
down much too much.

They put on everything they have seen and

1©
dona and so forth and it runs on for pages.

17
Then they've got to find a judge to study this

18
warrant and find out whether it states probable cause and if

19

*
he in his court or in his chambers, and busy; they have to

20
wait to present it to him and if he's gone

home, then they

21
have to track him down and find him and I think at the best,

22
with everything going in your favor, it takes at least three

23
hours to process a search warrant, and often it takes a whole

24
day before you can get the whole thing typed up and the judge

satisfied and signed and back and served»

The copies, you

2

have to give one to the clerk’s office so they will know what \

3

property you are going to search, going to seise, and then

4

make returns of it.
So? really, you know, the record here shews that the

officers approached Donald Vale5s house around noon.

And unless they had kept these people under close

surveillance, there wouldn’t have been any narcotic evidence

13

left in that house when they got back.

14

. How eanysu say that?

If, after they had seen

15

this transaction and they had just simply gone down and gotten:

16

«•search warrant, they hadn't been seen by Vale or anybody

17

else at that time.

.

A

18

Well, in the first place, they didn’t know that

10

they hadn’t been seen by the Vales and actually, for all they

20

knew, there were people in the house watching everything they

21

did, or they might very well havebeen neighbors watching what

22

they did.

23

24
25

They don’t know about that.

But, these things get

j

around vary quickly among people of this type.
Not only that, Mrs. Vale and James came back to the
house within minutes after the police officers got into the

:

when, the officers had just arrested Donald and Saucier right

Well, you would be making the same argument,

wouldn't you if they had arrested him six or eight blocks away j

they just intercepted him on the street and they thought there

Assume

they did havaprofoable cause to think he had narcotics in his
house, you would be making the same argument „■ that you should
not have to wait for a. warrant in order to search the most
likely places where narcotics might be located?
A

No, Mr® Justice.

We are relying on the several

decisions of this Court that following a valid arrest the
police, can make a search incident to that arrest, at the place
39

of that arrest.

And the only issue here is whether the place

was extended a little too far* as we see it* because Donald

Vale was arrested at the front door of his house,

Shipley* we distinguish very clearly.

and in one of them he had found narcotics„

It seems to me that

.the accused, all he had to do .was »go -in- and say, "How could
you have probabis cause for thir; one warrant, when you got out
five others?' And you really didn't'-know where it was? did
you?" .

j

'
And no, you didn't.

And how do you know where the

narcotic evidence is in a case like this where these people are]
very smart and they jump around and they change where they
keep the narcotic hoard: on their person and in the car and
different places.
Q

So, how would the police ever get it?

Is this the case in which the record shows that

they had habitually used three or four connecting houses?

Yea, Your Honor, three or four confir­

mations in connection, perhaps, primarily with the discussion .

yesterday.
I did make inquiry, Mr... Justice White, as to how long

20

it would take to get a search warrant, because I had no idea

21

of my own.

22

tion of that sort is for one of the officers to telephone that

23

they are coming down, giving the appropriate information to

24

get the necessary papers ready while they were on their way

2S

bask, in the daytime while the courts are open.

I was told that the ordinary practice in a situa­

44

It does take only about 30 minutes to’prepare the

i
2

necessary papers and add to that the time going in and coming

8

back out,, would not be more than one. hour, for whatever that5&i

4

worth.

5

Q

1 think you are posing the optimum circumstances

6

A

Inthe daytime? yes, sir,

7

Q

The optimum on a very favorable basis, sir»

8

A

There is no question about that? that is the

9
10

optimum situation.
Q

It would different operations if you had an

11

Assistant District Attorney there to assist with the prepara­

12

tion of that application to ba sure it rest the standards laid

i

Iem not'at all certain, Mr. Chief Justice, that

a search warrant could be issued in such a case on the type of
evidence they have»

How, the statement has been made that

there was a narcotics action which had taken place»

Actually,

no one saw that? they saw what they thought was a narcotics
transaction —»
Q

Wouldn’t that, be the essence of probable cause?

It’s more probable than not, that people in these circumstances
swallowing something on the presence of the officer were
swallowing something incriminating.
A

' X am sure that on that-alone they would never get

a conviction« at least I assume that from reading the

I don't dispute the probable causa.

a hearing should be granted in this case and it should not

15

have been handled summarily?

16

Justice Black and Mr. Justice White, while concurring in the

17

grant of certiorari

18

of last year, said that they dissented from the summary —

19

their summary reversal of those cases without a hearing.

20

that under those circumstances, it was thought best to grant a S

21

hearing in one case for the trial. ~
