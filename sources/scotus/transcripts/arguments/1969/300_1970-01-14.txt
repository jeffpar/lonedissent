ORAL ARGUMENT BY OMER LUELLEN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. LUELLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger and Associate

Judges of this Honorable Court:

This case, 300, on the peti­

9

tion for writ of certiorari in the Tenth Circuit.

It pertains

10

to the approval or nonapproval of the will of an Indian who

11

owned restricted properties, pursuant to our Federal statutes

12

governing the disposition of Indian lands upon the death of an

Indian.
I feel certain that this Court is familiar with the
fact that the governing statutes under which we are discussing
this case, are found in two sections, commonly called the 1910
Acfci Section 1. of the 1910 Act which now has been codified as
25 U.S.C. 372 and Section 2 of the 1910 Act which has now been
codified as 25 U.S.C. 373.
372 pertains to the determination of the heirs of a
deceased Indian that has an allotment or who will in the future
have an allotment, upon his death, dying without a will.
And Section 1 of 372 proceeds to state that upon the
death of the said Indian his heirs shall be determined by the
Secretary of the Interior and his decision shall be final and
2

1

conclusive.
Then we have Section 2 of the 1910 Act which is codi­

2
3

fied as 25 U.SoC, 373, whichstates that if ail Indian dies

4

owning an interest in trust — it doesn't really say an Indian,

3

it says "any person dying owning an interest in trust or re­

€

stricted lands or funds that are restricted, he shall have a

7

right" — this person shall have a right to make a will, pro­

8

vided the will shall not have any force and effect until and

9

unless — unless and until it is approved by the Secretary of

10

the Interior»
Now, that is the general situation here.

This

Indian, George Chahsenah, made a will, his last will in March,
1963.

He was a member of the Comanche Tribe of Indians.

He

lived in the little town of Apache, Oklahoma, located about 20
miles north of Port Sill.
I don't know whether any of you gentlemen or any
member of this Court has ever been to Fort Sill in World War I
or World War II»

several hearings were had before the Examiner of Inheritance,

without wills and also in regard to the approval or nonapproval
of the will.
We had, X think, around four hearings in this case
and finally, the Examiner of Inheritance made a — rendered an
opinion or ruling or opinion, in which he upheld the validity
of this will of George Chahsenah, and he approved the will.

In

Iiis finding, which, of course, is contained in the appendix, he
goes into certain findings about the fact that this Indian
apparently was addicted to alcohol and perhaps I should have
said prior to this time that in the hearings on this bill there
the devisees and legatees were represented by legal counsel.
The certain disinherited nieces and nephews were represented by
Mr. Hill; also Dorita High Horse, who it was found later by the
Court to be his natural daughter.
And the Examiner of Inheritance had made a finding
4

1

that although this Indian apparently was addicted to alcohol

2

and was an excessive drinker and he had made different wills at

different times.

competent to make his will? he was not intoxicated.

Then on appeal by the contestants of the will*, the

appeal was taken to the Secretary of the Interior*, as directed

11

by tine regulations and at that time the authority to approve or

Are you challenging the constitutionalityof the

Then is your argument based solely on the

Secretary, in doing what he did, acted within the scope of his

If you prevail and it's judicially reviewable,

all you are entitled to is for a remand to the Court of Appeals
to have the Court of Appeals decide the merits? isn’t it?
You have only raised with us, as I understand it, the
question presented is whether the decision of the Secretary of
the Interior approving or disapproving the will of an Indian is
subject tojudicial review.

That’s the only question presented

Are you suggesting that the judicial

That it must not be arbitrary and capricious? it

Yes-.

We — I think that, would be our position,

20

yes.

We feel that there is no statutory preclusion of review?

21

that Section 1 does not complement Section 2? therefore, it's

22

on the general,review abilities of the courts to review some­

23

time, someplace there must be a question that has an action in

24

the administrative review unless the statutes preclude the re­

Section 2.
Now, of course, this has been up in several cases.

Then, later on in Hayes versus Seaton case, which was

Then we come along with the He ffelm art case in the

and Section 2 complement

of the Interior’s decision approving or not approving the wills
of Indians, going back and saying Section 1 complements Section
2.
Approaching the factum of this will, why this •— why
the District Court held that the Secretary, acting in an
arbitrary and capricious manner, directed theapproval of the
will, that goes back to the facts, of course.
But when it want up on appeal the Tenth Circuit
didn’t go into the facts whatsoever.
15

They just said, "Ho

1

jurisdiction," and directed the action be dismissed and the

2

estate redistributed in accordance with the decisions of the

3

Secretary of the Interior,

4

Now, of course, in the District Court the - -‘acts were

5

gone into and the District Court held that in this case the

6

Secretary of Interior was acting in an arbitrary and capricious

?

manner, without the rationale for his decision and directed

8

that the estate be 'distributed pursuant to the terns of the

9

will.
The question is, going back to the facts of that

10

12

particular phase of it, which I think gets into this case any
figure it*
way you
/
is first, whether the Secretary of the Interior

13

could sit up there and determine whether this Indian did equity

14

to his heirs and does the discretionary authority go that far?

15

Can you just arbitrarily say to an Indian, "I don't want to

16

approve this willy this is an unjust will, unactual will,”

17

something like that.

18

memorandums to the Secretary of the Interior in 1941, which is

19

in my brief in two or three different places; at that time it

20

was thought by Mr, Slattery who was Chief of the Indian section

21

of the Interior, that the will of an Indian — he had a right

22

tomake his own will, and that the Secretary of the Interior

23

didn't have the right to substitute his will for that of the

24

Indian„

The Secretary did.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY RICHARD B. STONE, OFFICE

OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

Q

1

Let me ask at the outset, -Mr. Stone, whether the I

2

power to review the will and grant or withhold approval, is one;

3

in which the Secretary, for which the Secretary must have

4

reasons, or whether you think its an absolute, unreviewable

5

power?

A

6

The Government*s position, Mr. Chief Justice, is

7

that this is an un review able power under Section 2 of the 1910

8

Act.

9

in this case? one is that the Secretary's determinations are,

Of course, we are basically putting forth two contentions

10

in fact, unr©viewable, and the other is that even it there is a|

n

limited standard of review, which is to review whether the

12

Secretary has exceeded the scope of his authority in rendering
his discretionary decisions.

Is that a question on the merits, Mr.Stone?

Yes, I believe it is.

Q

And that was not reached by the Court of Appeals'*|

18

A

That question was not reached **•

19

Q

Why does the Government ask us to reach it?

Well, I think that is a possible disposition of

the case, and it would he understandable if the Court chose to
decide it this way.

2

I think the question was sufficiently

clear that the

Court could — that it is sufficiently clear that the Secretary
'

has the right to apply equitable considerations to the case,

4

that this Court could reach that decision quite easily? and

5

remand, if necessarily, with instructions to apply that rule»

Q

Would you think that the Court of Appeals, having

8

back to them that they might need some guidance as to what

11

,,

.-■■■-■

standards would apply to the review?
A

1 think it would be helpful, Mr, Chief Justice,

if the Court of Appeals were given some standards; of review, and

12

I think that the standard that they should be given is a v^ry

13

broad one and the Secretary has extremely wide powers in this

14

area and that a reversal would only be in order if the

15
10

17
18

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Secretary had grossly abused his scope of discretion»
But, 1 would like, with the Court's permission, to
discuss very briefly the historical context in which the general
Allotment Act and the Act of 1910 appears, because I think it
heavily
bears — this historical context bears very
/
on both of the
contentions that the Government is making in this case; the
contention that the Secretary is given absolute discretion, nonre viewable and the contention that Congress intended for him to
exercise very wide range of considerations in deciding whether
to approve or disapprove a will»
The General Allotment Act was one of the major

22

?

aspects of Congress’s effort to make reservation Indians

2

economically integrated aftd self-sufficient members of society»

3

Under the allotment system prior to 1934 the Government

4

divided and alloted reservation property and gave them f©

5

individual Indians and their families.

6

conveyed under an arrangement which this Court has characterised

7

not as a technical trust arrangement* but as a kind of special

8

guardianship by which the Department of Interior was entrusted

9

with the duty of restricting alienation of the Indians’ interest

-

The properties were

10

in these lands in furtherance of a Congressional policy which

11

this Court has described as "The promotion of prudence to

12

afford protection to dependent end natural heirs"and also*

13

"reserving restrictive land for the Indians.

..

14
15
16

This Court has recognized that the legal relationship
is a very special one between the Government and reservation
and communities
Indian tribes/and that special relationship has survived the

n

breakup of certain reservations and the allotment to individual

18

Indians of tribal land.

19

to the allotted lands themselves, and at least to the extent

20

that the Government continues to guard against improvident

21

alienation of these properties by the Indian allottees.

22
23
24

25

At least it has survived with respect

It was Congress's hope at the time that the original
Allotment Act was passed, that the Government’s guardianship
from the time at which it would be deemed advisable to remove
the restrictions -would be only about 25 years.
23

it was hoped

rt

1

that at the end of that time these lands could be conveyed to

2

the Indians in fee simple.

3

In the majority of instances, however, the removal

4

of restrictions

5

of these properties by parties unrelated to the Indian

6.

allottees, usually, in fact, by nonXndlans.

«f»

on alienation soon resulted in acquisition

10

Q

Mr. Stone, looking atat the brief filed by the

12

Solicitor General, he’s posed two narrow questionss whether

13

take equitable considerations into account.
Now, most of the members of the Court are familiar
with this historical background.

If would be helpful, I think,|
ij
if you would address yourself to the specific question.
A

Well, I am about to do this, Mr. Chief Justice.

I thought’, a reminder of the historical background, and par­
ticularly, the historical purpose of the General Allotment Act
cil
/was to assure that these conveyed Indian lands were made for
the benefit of Indian allottee and their families, would be
rather helpful to an understanding of the statutory context.

i

7

of June 25, 1910, which is the Act under consideration in this

8

case»
And Sections 1 and 2 of this Act, taken together,

9
10

provide a complete enumeration of the Secretary's powers over

11

the disposition of allotted properties on the death of the

12

allottee.
Section 1, as you know, authorizes the Secretary to

13
14
15
16
17

determine the legal heirs of the deceased? and this determinais to be made under
tion, by statute,
/ State law, in this case the law of the
State of Oklahoma, Section 1 as this Court is doubtless aware,
provides that the Secretary's determination of heirship is to

18

be final and conclusive and requires only that the Secretary

19

hold a hearing with notice*
This Court has explicitly held that the Secretary's

20
21

22
23
24
25

determinations of heirs are not reviewable by any court v

JLaX

other words, this Court has specifically held that Section 1
determinations ara not reviewable, even if errors of law - are
alleged.

This is the Fi-at Moon v. White Tail case, cited in

our brief at 270 U.S, 243,

25

The Court recognized in the First Moon case the

1

a

Secretary's unique and pervasive role with respect to these

3

restricted properties and found that "Abundant reason for the

4

provision precluding review becomes apparent upon consideration

5

of the infinite difficulties which otherwise would arise in ,

6

connection with the sundry duties of the Secretary of the

7

Interior relative to Indian allotments."
How, Section 2 of the Act of 1910, which is, of

8

under
9

course, the key provision

/ considerati.on in this case, re­

10

quires the Secretary, in a case in which the deceased. Indian

1?

has left a will, to approve or disapprove that will, if the

12

will is disapproved, as in this case, the property-passes in its

13

entirety by the laws of intestacy? that is, the restricted

14

property bequeathed in the will.
Q

IS

realty or personality of his own,does the Secretary have any
right to disapprove that will with respect to that property?

right to disapprove any disposition of that other property at
all.

”

•-

You're sure that it still wouldhave to be

Yes, I assume the Secretary in the case of such

would assume that the disposition that he made of the property

14

There is no regulation or statutory provision

A

Well, there, Mr, Justice Harlan, the regulations

are very silent with respect, both to the factum and to the
equitable considerations to be taken into account.

There are

practically no technical requirements laid out in the regulation
at all, simply that the testator should have testimentary
capacity and

that there should be two competent witnesses.

Unlike the Section 1 determination, which is pres­
cribed according to state law, that is, the determination of
heirship, approval of the will is subject to the Secretary's
own standards altogether.

There are no technical requirements

and the Secretary has produced very few technical requirements.
The regulations, in short, like the statute, leave the Secretary
and his delegates with maximum flexibility and discretion and
that is quite informative with the entire statutory scheme under
which the Secretary supervises these restricted lands, both
during the lifetime of the allottees and after the death of the

Q

Mr. Stone, we have observed that we don't have

the merits before us, but the merits are not totally irrelevant»
Would you agree that the contest between a daughter ~~ a natural,
illegitimate daughter, who had relatively little contact with
the testator and a niece with whom he had lived and who had a
relationship somewhat like that of a natural child? is it a
30

3

■

4

lands in the hands of the allottees and their families and

5

dependents is not a close question in a case.in which an

6

Indian has

8

I don't think it's important to note whether this is a close

9

question or not, because it is a question that has been left to

11

That's the j

■

12

question which we have infche case, whether it's been left

13

entirely to his discretion,
A

14

Yes, and it is the Government’s view that the

15

Secretary's: discretion at least applies to determining whether

16

property has been allocated for the purposes ~~ consistent with

17

the purpose of the Act,
I know in this regard, if the Chief Justice is

m
i®

interested in the closeness of the question from an equitable

20

point ©f view, that the reason the Solicitor didn’t find it

21

close at all, decided the fact that the testator had mads five

22

or six wills and had changed his place of residence around a

23

number of times so that he could feel, that there wasn’t that

24

much weight to be given fcothe equitable considerations on the

25

side of approving the testator's will and he felt quite
31
.

1

compelled by the fact that this man had never in his entire

2

lifetime, done anything to support his daughter; never used any

3

of the substantial income from his restricted properties in

4

furtherance of her support and the Regional Solicitor felt that'

5

this was quite contrary to the purpose of the allotment act

6

and of its conveyances.
Q

7

Am I correct that all the parties inthis case

are Indians?

3

'A

9

Yes? I believe that all the parties in this case

are Indians.

10

Q

II

So, when you keep emphasising the fact that

12

Congress meant for this to stay with the Indians, that's

13

irrelevant; isn’t it?

14

A

Well, no, Mr. Justice Marshall, I divide that

15

point into two.

1 think that it is — part of Congress's

16

purpose was to make sure that these lands passed on to Indians

17

as opposed to nonlndians.

18

Q

And what was the other point?

19

A

But the other point which I think was really more

20

central and was borne out by the statutory scheme, is that

21

22

Congress, intended for the specific — Congress was looking, not j
I
only to the interest of Indians in general, but to specilc

23

allottees and their immediate families and dependents.

I’m not

Mr. Stone, am I right about this, that what you

5

have been saying about equitable considerations, that's not that

6

broad? is it?

9

thinks that was unfair to exclude that person, then the

I gather what you

1 don't, think it has to be posed that narrowly,

Mr. Justice Brennan.

I think it's better posed in terms of

whether the disposition which he made of his lands is in con­
formity with the purpose of the allotment act, which was to
keep those lands in the hands of the testator and his family
or more generally, within the Indian community.
Q

Well, I know, but you ~~ what you have here is

that everyone involved is within the family, either nieces or •—
A

But, there is surely a distinction, however,
35

1

with respect to that, and I think the laws of intestacy bear

2

this distinction out altogether, since they give all of the

3

)
property to the daughter and none to the nieces and nephews.

4

There is a distinction»
■
■

Q

5

Yes, but the basic consideration here was that

6

he should not have excluded from his will, his natural daughter

7

in the distribution cr the devises, rather, of these allotted

8

lands.

9

A

That is correct»

10

Q

That's what the whole thing turned on.

The

11

Secretary just thought it wasn't fair not to have made a pro­

12

vision, for a share at least, of those lands to the daughter,*

13

isn't that right?

A

The Secretary made the decision that it was not

in keeping with the purpose behind the allotment for this girl
to be left out of her father's will.

Now —
!

Q

But, does it appear in the record, Mr, Stone,

whether the nieces were also allottees or potential allottees
i

from their parents?
A

From my knowledge it. doesn't, Mr, Justice White. <

It's possible that Mr» Hill may be better acquainted with that. ;
I didn't pick that up.

Well, it isn't in the record;: is it?

Excuse me?

5

But I don't think this

The. selection from the Congressional Record which I

6

just read to this Court, is illuminating, I think, not only

7

because it shows that Congress intended to give the Secretary

3

broad discretion with respect to whether restricted lands ought

9

to be alienated by wills from the immediate heirs of the allot­

10

ment holder? but also because it shows the purpose that Congress

11

had in mind when it gave allottees the right to make wills was

act to advocate prior policies of assuring that restricted lands

remained in the family of the allottee.

So, rather than to

allow the allottee in certain situations, later flexibility in
providing an even distribution of assets to his own heirs.
It would be a rather startling development in the
statutory context under which the Secretary maintains complete
power, both in

and testamentary to determine whether

this lands ought to be alienated to read the right of an Indian

No, no.

In his allotment?

14

A

No, they would not be included in his allotment,

15

Q

Well, then is the Government9s point that they

have to lose because Congress never intended that any except

Brennan,

I wouldn't say it that flatly, Mr, Justice

Q

And your claim is thatthe Government was left by

the Congress with complete and conclusive powers to decide this
question, without any judicial review?
A

Yes, that is the Government's contention.

X

think that, although it is not always the most appealing posi­
tion. for the Government to take, to say that there is absolutely

no review, X think that all of these special conditions under
which allotted properties are subject to the guardianshipof the
Secretary of the Interior, might be viewed as this Court has
viewed them in the historical context, of the Government's re­
lationship to Indian tribes and tribal lands.
Q

You don't think there is any significance to the

presence of nonreviewability clause in the case of an Indian 'who
has not left a will, in the absence of such a clause —
A

X think, Mr. Justice Harlan, that there is — it

would certainly be better, from the Government's point of view,
if the words Mfinal and conclusive" were cited again —
Q

It certainly would.

25

40

How do you explain the

1

difference between those two provisions in that regard?

A

Welly it is our position that the final and

conclusive language was not repeated in Section 2 because it.

was unnecessary.

Indian Affairs, over the willof an Indian, with absolute power

In order to enlighten Mr* Justice White and

the state courts in our state.

And the only thing about the

unrestricted property, in the State of Oklahoma we have a

statute which makes the surviving spouse a fourth heir to the,

11

the surviving spouse would ba entitled to one-third of it,

12

regardless of the will.

13

judge and probate judge might take into considerati.on is

14

the fact- that the Secretary, acting by and through his agent,

15

had either approved or disapproved the will.

16

that into consideration and might be persuasive to him, but he

17

wouldn’t have to be bound by that as to whether or not the will

unrestricted property.

office so held that Dorita High Horse was the natural daughter

of George Chahsenah, who was the testator of this will.

Since this case

has been in litigation, Miss Viola Attuwattu, who is the niece,

Yes, sixw it was»

j
They have official appraisals !

after any of these Indians die and are under the supervisionof

the area offices, sworn on behalf of the Secretary of the
Interior, they had to make an appraisal of these properties»
Q

If your argument is accepted, as I understand

it, the property would go to the daughter, even though she is
i llegitimate?
A

Q
A

Yes, sir.
And if it is rejected, it would, go to his niece.
No; it wouldn't even go to his niece, Your Honor.

She is deceased.

It would go to two of these grand nieces.

Yes,,

And that's what the Congress had in mind

and that's what

A

These new people,
Yes, sir? and that's what the Secretary of the

5

Interior had in mind when he asked Congress to pass this 1910

6

Act(= was to give him. all this power and authority so he could

7

determine these things himself, rather than leave it to the

8

United States court.

9
10
11

12
13

And certainly that was the first time that they ever
had any authority to make any wills, was under the 1910 Act.
Q

You mean Indians didn't have the authority to

make wills on their property, real and personal property?
A

Weil, if they owned personal property independent

14

of their restricted which was being held in. trust by the United

15

States Government under the General Allotment Act, they could

IS

have disposed of that property, if it is unrestricted property.

17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

j

Restricted property could not be disposed of by the
Indians until the 1910 Act, and then in 1913 amended Section
373 so that the Secretary of Interior then could either approve
or disapprove this will after the death of the Indian,

I

think they decided that sometimes they might approve this will
before the Indian died and then they would be caught with
having permitted the estate of this Indian to go to somebody
who was not entitled to receive it or they shouldn't receive it«j
And that is the whole purpose behind this thing, is to protect

54

!

1

these Indians and the Indian heirs of these testators and the

2

Indians who took advantage of this section to make a will.
So, I think if this Court would determine that it

didn't haw jurisdiction to hear this under -- they claim, under
