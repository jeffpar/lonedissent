OPAL ARGUMENT OF JAKES M. NA3RIT, III, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

6

MR. NABR1T;

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

8

Court;

This case is here on certiorari- to review a judgment

9

of the Supreme Court of Georgia.

It is the sequel to Evans

10

versus Newton,, decided here in January 1966.

11

was whether the Georgia Courts could substitute private trus­

12

tees for the City of Macon in order to permit a municipal park

13

given to the city in a will probated in 1914 to continued to be

14

operated only for white people as the testator directed., That

15

pari of the controversy was settled by this Court's decision,

16

which is now the law of the case, but the par*: is subject to

17

the 14th Amendment prohibition of racial discrimination,,

18

issue now is different and I think radically different.

19

whether the decision of this Court can be practically frustrate*

20

and subverted by the holding law here, the holding ofthe

21

Georgia courts that a municipal park is forfeited and ereverts

2.2

to the heirs of the long-dead testator, merely because the

23

Constitution in this Court's decision requires that the City

24

admit Negroes to the park along with whites.

25

The. issue then

The.
It is

The Petitioners are Negro citizens of Macon, who

2

1

argue that Baconsfield Park must foe operated as a public park

z

without racial discrimination and we contend* for

3

reasons that the Georgia Court’s ruling that the public must

4

forfeit this park to the testator’s estate* violates the

5

Federal Constitution.

6

Article 6 and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment

7

several

Specifically* the Supremacy Clause of

Now* the factual record in this case is also

8

radically different in that it is much more complete than the

9

record in Evans against Newton.

10

11

Let me briefly describe the

background of the case.

j

Augustus Octavius .Bacon died in 1914.

He had been

12

elected for four terms in the United States Senate and ha was

13

also a distinguished lawyer* who* it is relevant to note* had.

14

published the Disgest of the Opinions- of the Georgia Supreme

15

Court in 1872.

IS

He wrote his own 32-page will in his own hand in

17

1911* and that will left Bacon’s farm in trust with his wife

18

and surviving daughter during their lives and after their

19

deaths* in trust fors "The sole perpetual and unending use

20

benefitting enjoyment of the white women* white girls* white

2!

boys and white children of the City of Macon.”

22
23

The will made no provision for any reversion of the
41
property? it was-not a conditional gift. Rather* Bacon con­

24

veyed to the City and again 1 quote;

25

interest in and to said property hereinbefore deserll^t t. v!
3

"All right, title and

1

bounded, both legal and equitable, including all remainders

2

and reversions in every estate in the same with whatsoever

3

kind."

4

Bacon's will provided, that the land should be forever

a

used and enjoyed as a park and pleasure grounds®

6

that under no circumstances should it be sold or alienated,

7

or dedicated to any other use.

8
9
10

n

And he said

The will mentioned that he wanted the park a memorial
for his two dead sons and that he had no descendants bearing
the name of Bacon and he stipulated that the park should
forever be known as Bacons fie id.

Now, as my adversaries'emphai

12

13

15

18
17

21

22

size, Bacon quite plainly stated that he did not want Negroes
to use this park, and this was not, he said, because of any
unkindness or want of consideration for Negroes, but because he
thought that the two races should be separate in social rela­
tions and should not occupy the same recreation grounds.
So, we charitably concede that it violates Bacon's
solemn Intent for Negroes to use his park.

But we also want it

to be clear that it equally violates Bacon’s intent to destroy
the park and to revert it to the heirs.

Now, he never con­

templated this situation.
His will contains nothing to indicate that Bacon
preferred that his park be destroyed and

revert to his heirs,

23
24

rather than to have Negroes use it.

His intent on this ques­

tion. cannot be known? it’s unknowable? and that's conceded in

There are specific

statutory rights that the United States might have, which I am

going to come to, particularly with regard to the clubhouse

14

building that the WPA built, the major building on the property

15

Mid in that case the Mayor of the City and the Treasurer of the

16

City, made specific assurances to the United States that this

17

property would not be released by the City during the useful

life of the improvements and further, amazingly, that there

My clients' contribution has been the contribu­

4

tion of taxpayers generally to this park: city taxpayers and

5

federal taxpayers* and in all these capacities they have an

6

investment in this park.

The roads through the park were built by the city.

all this was tax­

bean reverted if the judgment below stands.
The — when we inspected this clubhouse building I
mentioned a moment ago* with the Superior Court's permission*

these WPA buildings have a, plaque, you know.

My colleague

found this WPA plaque only with some difficulty in that women’s
clubhouse, because someone had hung a mirror over it during a
redecoration so that —
Another plaque quoting a racial limitation in Bacon’s
will was rather prominently displayed.

So, I think there is- no

little irony in that considering 'the solemn assurances of
nondiscrimination that the city officials signed.
Now, all the maintenance in this park until .1964 was
done by the City Park Department. They treated this just like

7

1

any other park and the man who had been superirpendent since

2

1915 testified th it he treated taeonsfield like all the rest

3

of his parks.

4

income was used to add and beautify Baconsfield, in addition

5

to the city funds.

The only exception was that some of the trust

from this park that furnishes $5,000 or $7,000 a year annually

as income for the trust.

It also includes $131,000 or more in

cash or bonds in the bank that they got when the highway con­

But this case involvas more than who gats this money?

'12

13

whether :tt9s the people of th© heirs? it involves a principle.

14

It involves whether or not the law is going to perpetuate this

15

kind of racism.
When Negroes began using Baconsfield in 1963 the

16

17

City concluded that it could not exclude them from the park

18

and that was obviously correct, since this Court had ruled as

19

early as 1955 that park segregation was unconstitutional? and
\

20

it ruled in 1957 that a municipal trust couldn't be discrimina­

22

Board of City Trusts.

Court, stating that they couldn't discriminate, was filed, it

When the Georgia Courts approved the City5s resig-

ingly the land and the other assets revert to the donor's
estate as a resulting trust and that, therefore, it is to be
distributed as part of his estate in accordance with the will
provisions for the individual estate.
Now, 1 think each of the four arguments we make is
sufficient to justify a reversal.

Let me identify the four

arguments, each in a sentence or two before beginning to develop
the first one.
The first point is that the decision below which
1
forfeits public property, applies a sanction against the
c

running all the way back to McCulloch against Maryland,,

3

forfeiture is effected in a way it happens which also dis­

The second point we will make is that —

— that 1 would argue if I had to face that more difficult
question —that our legal system, that our courts can't he used
by dead men to perpetuate their bigotry in the law and that
racism has to die with the bigot and that the legal system can*'-.:
give it perpetuity»
So, I don't believe if I had the case here, that I
would concede — I believe that I would argue that a racist's trusts can't be enforced, but I don't think .
Q

Well, you haven't got that case here, then?

Q

Suppose, since we have you stopped for a moment,

suppose you had a case where the donor in 1925 to '30 had given
land for use as an airport and for no other purpose, either
with a private diversionary clause in the gift or subject to a

and the airplanes got bigger and needed longer runways and by

•They cannot have sole use of it; Negroes have to be admitted,
too, \ But the part-is that-Negro use-in this kind of a situa­
tion, at least, where you have a vast parkland — Negro use
doesn’t diminish the white use.

It's net a case ~~ as for

example, where you have a trust fund and if led to one group
would have to be divided with another group, the .amount left
for the first group would be diminished.

That kind of trust,

everybody„
Now, the third argument, and — well,, let me make an
overall point»

1 think there is nothing special about trust

laws that exempts them from the commands of the Equal Protec­

14

tion clause, nor does the fact that the law involved ;te the

15

common law, and not statute law, place it outside the reach of

IS
17

the constitution.
We make this point as amply established by the

m

decision last term in Presbyterian Church against the Hull

19

Church where the Court unanimously concluded that Georgia

20

Courts deciding a common law trust law must do so in conformity

21
22.

23

24
25

with the First Amendment guarantee made applicable to the
states by the 14th Amendment.

And numerous casas in different

contexts make the point about common law judgment a law being
subject to the 14th Amendment,
New York Times against Sullivan makes that point in
12

1

very plain language, that the state's libel law has to march to

2

the 14th Amendment.

3

volving a common-law crime, illustrates the same idea in

4

another context.

In Edwards:; against South . Carolina, in­

Of course# trust law is normally a matter for state

S
S

determination ? of course Georgia has the last word in deciding

7

its common-law trust as a general pattern; but that6s only
opens the question, we submit, of whether the law as served

8

by Georgia conforms to the command of the constitution.

§

And

10

it's tovthat question that I addressed myself with these four

il

arguments.

v

A fifth argument, as I indicated, is rendered in the

12
13

fundamental proposition announced in McCulloch against Maryland

14

in 1819.

15

national interest; that even as then, when using the basic

SS

taxing power, may they penalize the Federal interest.

17

think the decision be lev? violates the command of Federal

18

supremacy, not because this Court’s mandate has been directly

19

flouted# but rather because the state has decreed that valuable

20

city property has to be forfeited entirely on the grounds that,

21

the constitution and the decision of this Court require that

22

the City admit Negroes to Baconsfield.

The states have no power to take action hostile to a

And we

,

We complain not that there would still be segregation,

25

about the fact of the forfeiture itself and this valuable

Now, hare the sanction as the added characteristic

and this Court’s decision

and the added impact of discouraging desegregation, just as in

10

the Prince Edward County'school closing case.

IS

the park conveys to Negroes unmistakably the plain message

12

that if you assert your 14th Amendment rights it won’t get you

13

anything.

14

that, obviously discourages compliance with the constitution.

17

from such a forfeiture would be a clear direction by testators.

6
7

The fact that nothing*s happened which prevents white -women

and children from using the park, and the point we make in our

9

brief is that the only manner in which the state court could

10

have logically reached its conclusion in the uses of the trust

11

had failed is by the legal premise, an implicit legal premise

12

that Negro use as a matter of law, diminishes the white use

because Negroes are, per se, offensive and obnoxious.

15

the 14th Amendment prohibits.

17

theory adopted* they never said anything like feat,

What we

18

contend is that's the only logical foundation on which it can

19

rest.

20

This case might be more difficult if the Court below

There was one in the Holmes case.

So, as soon as

as the city interpreted Bacon's

DEPUTY SOLICITOR GENERAL AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Claiborne.

the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

It seems to us relevant that 'this case is both a

wills case and a parks case; either one alone, but both to­
gether.

And yet it's not a case about how to construe a will

nor is it even a case about which restrictions in wills should
be enforced or even which racial restrictions are bad, and
which should be ignored.

We are dealing with a racial
'

,

17

1

restriction made some years ago — a half century ago and the

2

question iss what effect, if any, can he given to it now,

3

half si century later in light of the constitutional rule which

4

has he'come clearer in that span of time.
But importantly also, we are dealing with the

5

{'

6

provision in the will that affects not any sort of property,

7

but public property, a public rfacility of some substance here

8

in the City of Hacon.

9

the question of whether a public facility shall fee closed be­

10

cause the rule of nondiscrimination has been held to apply to

11

it, which this Court held two terms ago.

Arid In that sense we’re concerned with

12

WsEre not saying simply that state courts can never

13

enforce a restrictive covenant or restrictive provision in a

14

will.

unenforceable — no question about that at this point «— this is

1fi

Wefre saying, rather, that a provisioni which has been held

The Court has held that 'this restric­

So, the question is rather, whether indirect effect

IS

can be given to that provision by decreeing a reversion, the

2C

effect of which is withdraw a public facility from the munici­

£1

pality which otherwise enjoyed it, from all the people in it,

21

arid it did so with the inevitable impact and effect of dis­

23

couraging those, who in similar circumstances would sue to gain

a

entry as they have a constitutional right to do with they are
dealing with this sort of public facilities.

13

We sight rest on tbs proposition that when these
factors coincide the state court cannot effectuate a racial
covenant by decreeing a reversion even if the testator had
provided specifically that that should be the result in the
event that segregation were no longer possible in his public
facilitya
It seams to us, however„ that this case is a good
deal easier, because here, clearly the state court had alter­
natives,

We're not faced with Senator Bacon5s clear intent

that in these circumstances there shall be a reversion *

Nor

are we faced with a state law that does not provide for such
accommodation when the exact intention of the testator is
impossible *

We’re not faced with of those few states where Gy

Pres is the law.
Here we have a Georgia law which on its face seems to
permit carrying out the dominant purpose of, the testator, and
varying some of his incidental provisions when they become
impossible of performance, as here the racial provision has
become impossible of performance®
The case is easier, both because it seems more
obvious that the Georgia Courts had options and becausef having
options and having seemed to strain, the injury is all the
greater to those who *— because of whose threatened presence
in the park the gate is closed.

Whenever the state is seen, to

have strained on the fact of it in order to prevent the rule

1

of desegregation from going into effect,

Q

What would you think, Mr.

Justice: the one Mr. Naforit gave, which is that in that circum­

stance there would be no way of'approximating the purpose of

the testator in providing funds for an airport.

i
2

A

I think in several respects it does not injure

them all equally, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

First, it is, I think, plain that the least advan­

taged members of the community have the greater need for the

5

park and therefore, suffer more by its closure.

6

small part of our argument.

But that: is a

It doss favor discrimination and discourage challenge .

7
8

to discrimination in comparable circumstances when challenging

9

the exclusionary policy of any public facility which is subject

10

to this sort of provision.

And when the result is that the

11

facility is closed and you gain nothing by it, obviously there

12

has been a discouragement to the exercise of the constitutional

13

rights to seek entry on a nondiscrirainafcory basis to public

14

facilities.
tod finally, there is always the injury which results

15
16

when the state puts its power, its prestige, its official

n

declaration on the side of discrimination, and says, in effect,

is

"The entry of these Negroes to this park would' be so obnoxious

is

that we presume Senator Bacon would have closed his park rather

20

than to have allowed them in."

\

Q

Supposing Senator Bacon -- supposing the day

after he died ^his Court had handed down an Opinion arid said the

hkd, two days later, raised the question on it and challenged it,

would you make the same argument you are making now?

could not be run as he directed it be run and his heirs

.

A

I think —

Q

Not so dedicated to the public that it couldn't

be withdrawn?
A
Justice Black,

I think that argument might be available, Mr,
I think this case is far stronger,, because the

park has operated a half a century a's /a public facility, which
not only increases the injury which results in its closure,
the implications involved in that closure on account of race,
but also in the traditional terms of the cy pres doctrine the
effort to continue a rule

which has taken effect, which has

been in existence for some time, it recognised as being much
stronger than the event
.Q

You mean constitutionally stronger?

What pro­

vision of the constitution would make it stronger after the
years?
i

•

A

There, I think it's only in terms of the injury

Mir, Justice Black,

But also in terms of the options available

*

I

to the state.

After all, Constitutional Law is some venture of

o:r question of possibilities and alternatives.

When the ai-

'

tornativas are evenly balanced it may be that the constitution
views the act as neutral.

Whan withdrawing a public facility

"

after half a century, is done for the sole purpose of avoiding j
th^e mixing of the races in that public area, it seems all the
'
.
moire a reflection of an official policy against desegregation
ano’ that is constitutionally wrong.

about the Georgia Court having preferred one option to another?

3

we don!t, of course, include the individual judges the state

of Georgia Courts involve.

statute which provided in these terms "whenever a racial

restriction is included in a rule which establishes a public

9

intent as to what should happen when that racial restriction

ii

would be the clearest indication of the State's singling out

this condition as critical as distinguished from all the other

circumstances and cy pres would be applied.

Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

The case for the Respondents can be stated very simply,

I believe.
23

1

Senator Bacon devised his property in trust for the

2

sole and exclusive benefit of the white women and children of

3

the City of Macon.

4

that Baconsfield cannot beqperated in accordance with that

5

racial restriction, even by the City of Macon as Trustee, or

6

by private trustees, excepting in acting in accordance with

7

that decision, the Supreme Court of Georgia then held that

8

under Stata Law the sole purpose for which this trust was

9

created, applying several rules of construction under state law

This Court decided in Evans versus Newton

10

had failed.

That the trust terminated for that reason without

V.

regard to the racial limitation in the slightest,

tod because

2

of the state statute providing that whenever a trust fails for

3

any reason, a resulting trust is implied for the benefit of the

14

5

donor or testator or his heirs because of that statute, again, j
■ ;
having nothing to do with race or discrimination in any respect;

6

this property reverts under state law back to the heirs.

Q

How long has that statute been passed?

A

Your Honor, it’s a statute of long vintage.

It’s predated to

when this will was made,

tod for — as

far as I know, it has been a majority law for a hundred years
or more.

I can get the exact date if the Court would like to

have it, but it’s a statute of long standing.
So, our position is, may it please the Court, that
the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court involved nothing more
than the application of state law to a state will and is
24

j

1

completely consistent with the holding in this Court in Evans

that the Supreme Court of Georgia's decision should he upheld.
