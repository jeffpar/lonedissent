ORAL ARGUMENT BY ANTHONY 6. AMSTERDAM, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

7

MR. AMSTERDAM:

8
8

Number 829, Lewis and

the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

The basic issues in this welfare case have become
}

n

somewhat clouded by the promulgation of new state welfare
i
regulations since the beginning of the suit by the enactment of

12

a new state statute since the decision below, by the promulga­

13

tion of proposed regulations under that state statute not yet

14

in effect, and by the variety of positions taken by the parties

IS

and the amici in this Court.

10

m

4

For this reason, I think it useful at the outset, to

M

describe and to distinguish several different factual situations?

18

that is, family situations which are represented by the several

19

plaintiffs and the plaintiff interveners in this case.

20

To identify the legal issues presented in each of

21

those situations and then to describe what is and what is not

22

still an issue in the case.

23

Now, the Appellants in this Court include the indi­

24

vidual plaintiffs below, the individual plaintiff interveners

25

below and the classes which they represent.
2

All of these

1

2
i»

4

persons are members of households which are eligible,, or which
i

claim eligibility to receive welfare benefits under the
Federally-supported AFDC Program? that is Aid to Families With
Dependent Children, established by the Social Security Act.

5

In each case the family unit which is eligible for

6

such assistance, consists of ,a, mother- and-her natural children„

7

The children are, under both Federal and State laws, dependent

8

children, because their natural father is continually absent

9

from the home»

It is that circumstance, that is, their being

10

dependent children which renders them eligible for assistance,

1?

if,, in addition to being dependent, they are also needy.

12

it is that circumstance which requires the determination of the

13

extent of their need for purposes of determining their assis­

14

tance levels.

15

Now, in each of these cases, eat

And

and all, California

16

has taken account in determining need of financial factors

17

relating to the presence in the household of a man who is not

18

the natural ox the adoptive father of the dependent children.

19

I will conisu shortly to the legal basis for California's*

20

action.

21

the varying relations of the male figure to the children and

22

to the mother, creates three distinct factual situations which

23

have differing legal import.

24
25

For the present it is important simply to note that

The first of these is what, we will call the. stepfather
situation, and the stepfather situation is a case in which
3'

1

the male in the house is ceremonially married to the mother.

2

This is the case of the. plaintiff interveners, the Bell family

3

and the Simms family.
The second situation is what is in the jargon known,

4
5

as the "MARS" situation.

MARS is an acronym for a man assuming

the role of spouse and this is a situation in which the man is

§
7

8

not ceremonially married to the mother and is not the father of
any of her children.
The third situation is the so-called unmarried father

9
10

situation.

The unmarried father situation is a case in which

the man is not ceremonially married to the mother but he is the

11

father of at least one of her children in the household.

12

Now,

that child would not be the AFDC eligible child, ordinarily,

13
14

15

because, having both parents in the house, it would not be
dependent.

There are special programs and situations in which

he might be, but for purposes of these cases, the AFDC child

16

does not include that common child, but the common child is
17

important because of the way California law treats these cases,
18

19

a matter I will come to shortly.
The first thing I want to look at in all three situa­

20

'

tions, briefly, is how Federal law and particularly the Federal
21

KEW regulation which applies to this situation.

That is:

22
45 C.F.Ro Sec. 203,1 treats these cases.
23

Under Federal law the three cases are treated exactly

24

the same.

That is to say that in all of them if there are any

25

4

1

actual contributions by the man the MARS, the stepfather, to

a

the support of the children, to the upkeep of the house, that

3

is considered income to the household, the what is known as

4

FBU, FAraily Budget Unit, tor purposes of computing whether or

5

not the family is needy and the extent of the need.
However, no income may be assumed to be received from

6
7

any of these three male figures, for purposes of determining

8

eligibility, as needy, or for purposes of determining the ex­

9

tent of the need.

And this is so, because under the relevant

10

Federal regulation income may be assumed to be coming to an

II

eligible AFDC family only if it is coming to a natural or

12
13
14

IS
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

adoptive parent of the AFDC children or if it is coming to a
stepparent who fulfills four criteria;

that he be ceremonially

married to the mother, that he be legally obligated to support
the child, that that legal obligation be under a state law of
general applicability and that the state law be one which re­
quires stepparents to support their children to the same extent
that natural or adoptive parents are required to support their
children.

Q

Am 1 right in understanding that you have just

bee describing the HEW regulation?
A

Exactly„

Q

Right.

A

What 1 am doing is to describe its effect not
5

1

yet with regard to California law, but. to say that in each of

2

the three sets of situations here the HEW regulation would

3

very plainly say "no assumption of income."

4

the terms of that regulation.

5

6

I am describing

Q

That's what I understood you to be describing;

A

Mow, the result, of course, is that all of

right.

7

3

these three situations are out in terms of assumption of income.

9

The MARS and the unmarried father not ceremonially married, but

10

the ranch more important aspect which also applies to stepfathers

II

is that there is no here obligation under state law of general

12

applicability, which is to the same extent as the liability

13

which California puts for support on the natural father.
I'm going to come bach and take those requirements

14
IS
18

17

apart in detail, because the]/ are the nub of this case, but I
want to pass to what California does with these three situations
to indicate what I think is still a live issue in this Court.
At the time this suit was filed, California also

18
59

treated sill three situations the same.

20

each and every case the stepfather, the MARS and unmarried

21

father, California said that any income which he received,

22
23
24
25

That is to say that in

whether or not he actually contributed to the family, was
treated as income to thefamily after certain deductions were
taken.

He was allowed certain kinds of deductions, spelled out

in state law.

But, once those deductions were taken,

6

I

California law assumed that the rest of his income was avail

z

able to the family and either deducted that amount from the

3

need in order to reduce the welfare grant, or if it reduced

4

so the family was no longer needy within the definition, the

5

family simply became ineligible.

8

Mow —

7

0

Ag I understood‘California's review or this, ,

8

an unmarried father were living as the husband of another

9

woman and with 11 children of theirs, if he were an unmarried

10

rather or a child in an AFDC household,, with another mother an

11

one child in that family,, his income would be attributable to

12

that second unit?
A

13

Well, not

no, no.

I may not understand the

14

question, Mr. Justice Stewart? the unmarried father situation

13

only exists where the man is now living in this household.

18

living in this household and has one child in common with the

17

mother in this household, then he's an unmarried father,.

18

How —

19

Q

I see.

A

That's right.

20

He1;

It's only applicable if he's living in

the house.

21

The effect of this regulation

22

only deals with the man that’s in the house? that’s the whole

23

issue.

24

Q

Ail right? thank you.

25

Q

Well, he might be living in more than one
7

11

.

1

household; is that not possible?

z

A

Yes, he might be —

3

Q

That's partly, at least, what I suggest Mr,

4

Justice Stewart had in mind.
A

5

We had no such situations in any of these

6

cases»

That is, California — as far as these cases.go, you

7

are dealing with a situation where a man has a stable relation­

8

ship in this one household»

9

Now, I have some very real questions as to whether

SO

he might be living in one household, more than one household

II

for the purposes of characterization.

S2

be more than one kind of a stepfather.

13

married to one woman at once, except in extreme cases which we

14

might conjecture»

Obviously he couldn't
He's only ceremonially

15

As far as the MARS situation goes, 1 think he would

16

not meet the MARS definition, because he probably couldn't be

17
18

holding himself out to be married — again, except the extreme
situation that we might conjecture, in a way that he would be
■

19

treated as a MARS,

20

two houses because the only thing that is required is that he

21

22

A father might very well end up by living in

live there and that he have a child in the house.
splits his time, then he may be in two households.

And if he
We have no

.

23
24
25

such situation.
Now, the important change in California law is
reflected toy the enactment, effective November 10, 1969, of a
8
1

I

new statute which is set out on page 93 of the appendix to our

2

brief, which changes the California rules as to the KARS; that

3

is the man assuming the role of the spouse.

4

It is no longer the case that his income t. minus

5

deductions is attributed to the family,

6

make an agreement with the mother relating to the amount which

7

he shall contribute and the statute requires that he make a

8

contribution which is no less than what it would cost to pro­

0

vide himself with an independent living arrangement.

10

II

Now he is required to

All of

this is governed also by proposed regulation.
And then,- the effect of the new California statute is

12

to attribute to the family a proportion of the amount of that

13

contribution payment which he is required to make.

14

Now., let me describe the effect of this new statute on

15

our three sets of situations.

16

absolutely no effect.

17

time about Section 11351, which is the statute which this suit

18

originally challenged; it is still in full force and effect as

19

to stepfathers, and therefore, as to all past and future

20

matters, that is a live issue here with regard to the

21

stepfathers, that is the plaintiff interveners here.

22
23
24
25

One, as to the stepfather,

We are still talking at this point in

With respect to them, what we seek in this case is a
declaration of the validity of the Federal regulation under
the statute.

A consequent declaration by this Court of the

illegality, because it is inconsistent with the statute and
9

1

with the Constitution of 11351 and if the Court upholds the

2

Federal regulation there's an end of 11351, because California

3

has admitted from the beginning of this case that it was in­

4

consistent with the Federal regulations»

5

held andwe think there can be no question about that.

The Court below so

6

And the effect of that also would be back

7

Q

That would result in permanence in those three?

8

A

That would result in a reversal of the judgment

9

below.
Q

As respects those three, you say that the court

and therefore allowed California to enforce its rules.

time.

With respect to all parties at that

The new statute wasn’t in effect and the decision was

made as to -Q

Are we now talking about the regulation that

was promulgated af&er this decision was made?
A

No; what was promulgated after the decision was

made was not a new HEW regulation. -—
Q

X understand.,

A

— but a new state statuta»
10

!

Q

1 understand? yes.

2

A

As to that there has been no determination

3
4

below and I'm not asking this court to rule on that, no.
Q

You confuse me because you referred us to page-

5

93 of your appendix? it has that new statute in it, and I

6

thought you were talking about that.

7

A

No.

I'm sorry,

Excuse me.

The new statute simply raises

8

the issue which I am addressing at the moment of what's moot

B

and what's not.

25

I know where it is? I understand the case, but

I thought that you were off on the new statute.
A

No.

You're not?

I am going to come now to the effect of

the new statute, which is that in the MARS situation --Q

Nov/, before you do that, Mr. Amsterdam, what

weight do we give the new statute, except for purposes of
possibly evaluating mootness of the case?
A

Absolutely none.

I think that we would chalieng

the new statute —
Q

You are not challenging it now?

A

We are not, and we do not, and that's exactly

what I want to say: that with regard to the MARS situation there
is a question as to mootness as to future relief.

On the other

hand, the case is not moot, because past payments which are
11

?

allowable under California law are still an issue up to the

2

date of the new statute with regard even to the MARS cases,
And what we ask this Court to do- as to the MASS

3
4

statute is that after reaching the issues in this case, which

5

are required by the presence of stepfathers, that is holding

6

the Federal regulation valid and 11351* the state statute,

7

8
9
10
11
12

invalid, simply to remand the case to the District Court to
allow the parties to frame the issues under the new .statute,
challenge it, if they pleasej see how the state regulations
solidify, and in effect, equitably clean up the case after this
Court makes the major decision, which we think is the validity
of the Federal regulation,

19
20

21

22
23
24
25

Well, isn’t there an alternative approach to

it, too, and that's to just wash the case out and let the
litigation resolve itself under the new regulations and
statutes?
A

Well, this Court would have to remand, if it resolved

the case by holding the Federal regulation valid? the Court
would have to remand for disposition of a number of issues:
the amount of back payments and that sort, of thing —Q

When you say "we would have to," you mean it

would wise to do so?
A
Q
A

Oh, it would be ordinary to do so, 1 think.
Usual.
I think appropriate in the sense that there are
12

!

a number of unresolved issues that would then be cleaned up.

2

But, I think that this Court need not entangle itself,, is

3

really what I’m saying, in any consideration of the new

4

statute and my answers to the Chief Justice’s question is

5

precisely that that statute should have no effect here, as to

6

mootness or anything else.
Q

7

Do I understand the new legislation, your

8

position is, has no bearing whatever in the stepfather sifcua-

9

fcxon.

10

here?

)

That is precisely as it was when the case was brought

*1

A

12

Q

Exactly„
And that, that presents the question, the basic

13

question of the validity of the Federal regulation held invalid :

14

by the District Court.

15

A

Correct.

16

Q

And also ofthe validity

17
18

of the stateregula­

tion or statute, as the case may be, but only in the stepfather
situation.

i
A

!9

Well, that’sunclear.

That

isthe

one

additional

20

point I wanted to make.

21

for reasons that escape me as a matter of California law, con­

22
23

24
25

The; regulations under the new statute,

tinue to treat the married father as he was treated under the
old law.

I see no basis in California law for that and I think

we've just got to wait and see.

And again, this•is why it's

got to go back to the District Court for resolution of these
13

kinds of questions.

1

Q

z

Well, are you going to tell us ~ you8ve al­

ready told us that in the stepfather situation we needn’t be

3

concerned with the new statute»

4

A

5

Q

6

Absolutely.
Well, now, what is there in the MARS situation

and the unmarried father situation that the new statute says

7

that makes doubtful whether those cases are here?
S
A.

9

Well, the new statute changes the entire method

of California's treatment of income in those cases.

ISO

It no

.longer is the case that the income to the male is treated as
1! 1
income to the family unit after deduction.

12
Now there is a new requirement, which is that he
13
make a contribution, which is described in detail.

It has to

14
be the.same thathe would make to support himself independently
15
to the family, and a percentage of that is treated as income.
16
We don't really know —
17
Q

WEII, now, and because of this change, I

18
gather, there could be no conflict with the Federal regulation
19
if the Federal regulation is valid?

20
A

Oh; there may or there may not be, but until

21

;

we know what the new state-proposed regulation —

22
Q

We needn’t deal with it?

Is that it?

A

It8s not he,re now, because we just don't know.

23
£4
It simply is not right, is the answer I can —
25

14
i

i

1

Q

2

filed here?

3

A

Pardon me?

4

Q

Is any of this disco.ssi.on

5

Is any of this diseussedin the written papers

the new

statute or new regulation in the briefs?

6

A

We have both the new statute in the brief and

7

it's in thfe 'last appendix to our brief, a discussion -of-the

e

effect of it? yes, but not for the purpose of having this

9

Court decide it*

10

Now, coming briefly to two sets of questions, the

!!

validity of the Federal regulation and the constitutional

12

issues.
I propose to start with the validity of the Pedera

13
14

regulation.

I think that that is not, with all due respect to

15

the court below

a very difficult question.

Let's take a look at what this regulation does and

16
17

doesn't do.

18

decide how much income a family has to have or lack before they

19

are needy.

20

to the state? what is needy.

21

It does not restrict in any way state power to

In that sense, the determination of need is left

It dcsn't restrict in any way state power to limit

22

how much of a family’s need the state is going to supply.

23

far as this regulation goes, maximum grants and that sort of

24

thing, are unaffected.

25

As

Moreover, it does not restrict in any way state powei’:

I

1

to determine how much income or resources an AFDC family has

2

for the purpose of determining whether it's needy,, insofar as

3

relates to actual income received»

4

received the Federal regulation allows the state to treat it

S

as income to the family.

If any actual income is

What it does do is to deny the state to treat as

6
7

income and as resources monies which are not proved to be

8

actually available to the AFDC family, except under specified

9

conditions which are designed to assure that the situationis

10

one in which, even without proof of actual availability of

»1

money, meaningful economic protection of the AFDC child is

12

important.

13
14

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Now, I want to make very clear — I5m going to come
to the specific regulation in a moment, but a vitally important
part of this case is that this particular regulation, the BEW
regulation, is only one sub species, a particularized aspect
of a more general HEW regulatory policy.
Since 1967 HEW has provided that only income and
resources that are in fact, available to an applicant or a
recipient for current use on a regular basis are to be taken
into account in determining need and the amount of payment.
And for example, HEW says that in a case where a
child h^s a support obligation under a court, order, from the
father, that the state may not treat as income the amount which
the court has ordered paid unless it is actually paid.
16

Now, the importance of that in this case is that the

1

ground 6f California's position here and the District Court's

2

decision below, doesn't just knock out this HEW regulation?

3

it would knock out every HEW regulation which announces the

4

-

5

6
7

8
9
10

II
12
13
14
15

general or specific policies of nonassumption©f income„

Be­

cause what California says it has a right to do, is to treat
as an income in an AFDC family, any and every legal obligation
created by state law, without proof of actual receipt.
Now, HEW has found over the course of many years
of administering this program that it is one thing to have:
a bird in the bush? you're not going to have a bird in the hand
as fat as an AFDC family goes.

There are lots of legal

obligations that just don't come off and don't come through and
it is the purpose of the HEW regulation to assure that except
In a limited class of cases where one can be very sure that
legal obligations are, in fact, likely to come through, that

16
states are not going to be permitted t© assume income.
17
Now, we think that the position of the court below
18

in California is wrong insofar as they purport absolutely to
19

preclude HEW from limiting state power to treat nonreceived,
20
theoretically available resources as income

to the family.,

21

Our position is that the statute, precisely, because
22
it requires the HEW to approve state plans which are required
23

to provide for a consideration of income and resources, allows.
24
25

HEW to decide what kind of income arid resources are meant by
«
.

17

1

that and if HEW reasonably sets restrictions on what the

2

state can assume in the way of income# those restrictions are

3

valido
Here# in light of the shortness of time# I mean, to

4
5

refer to only two of the restrictions and show how obviously

6

consistent with statutes they are .
HEW, following King v, Smith required that before

7
8

income be assumed# state lav? impose a legal obligation and

9

that the legal obligation be a general one.

That is# under a

10

state statute of general applicability .and the same as the

11

father .

So# let me just start, with the "same as the fathers."
Under California law# as under most law# father's

12

13

.obligation is not defeasible if the father leaves the home.

14

He can be pursued and be required to support his child any time,

15

anywhere.

The obligation imposed by this particular California,

law exists so long# and only so long as the man is in the home
and that's true with regard to stepfathers# MARS and everybody.
As soon as he leaves the house the right ceases„
Now# of course#. .HEW could require that" California assure some­
thing a parental obligation to support# and not the half-baked
right that California has given children in the situations
presented inthis case# because California# HEW can insist#
might give them a full-fledged right, one which# if not useless,
simply because if a mother threatens to enforce it the man
leaves and there is an end of the right.

Well, don’t spend any time on that, because I

understand your position is independent of that.
A

Fine,

We need only rely to knock out this regulation on
the proposition that the duty to support is not the same
and it's not under a generally"applicable statute.
An. additional reason why the Secretary could
insist that the obligation be the same, is fairly, evident from
the facts of this case.

It is an affirmative purpose of this

statute to keep families together.

If California is permitted

to put in a regulation thac says that income is to, be assumed

the Court:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

I should like at the beginning to indicate that

the Government's position with respect to the significance of
the new California statute and question of mootness, is as
stated by Mr, Amsterdam,
We feel the case is: not moot.

The essential

questions were presented to the Court when, prior to the enact­
ment of the California statute, are still here.

Those basic

questions relate to the validity of the HEW regulation.

We

agree, as well, that the most appropriate course would be for
the Court, as to the effect of the new California statute,
assuming reversal to the decision below, to remand it to the
20

1

lower court for further proceedings, to determine just what,

2

that particular statute means as to those situations affected

3

by it.
Q

4

!ed like to ask you one question, Mr. Beytagh,

5

that may give me a better background to understand some of the

6

problems.
Independent of whatever* right the parties have,

7

8

laying that aside for the moment, can you tell us whether, in

9

a given situation if a state program under its statute is

10

not in compliance with HEW regulations, whether the Federal

11

Government may terminate the grants to the state and terminate

12

the participation in the program.
MR. BEYTAGH•

13
H

Government can do that; yes.
Q

IS
16

19

A

22

I would think, by the State Government.
Q

25

Obviously it would result with a great deal of

disaster involved in it, but this is the hold which the Federal
program has on each of the states, basically; is it not?
A

23
24

That9s correct, and. a result that, of course,

is not one that is desired, either by the Federal Government or

20
21

And that would produce the result that was

across the board; would it not?

17
18

My understanding is that the Federal

I think that8s. one way to express it; yes,

Your Honor.
The statute clearly-sets out the responsibilities of
21

I

the Secretary and one of those responsibilities is to pass on

2

state plans and a very elaborate scheme is set out for the

3

state plans and what they should entail.
Q

4

Isn't that the best method of enforcement of

3

Federal regulations, rather than piecemeal litigation by in­

6

dividual recipients?
A

7

I think it may well be a better means of

Q

effectuating that.

9

as the Court well knows, came out of its decision in -King: versus

Smith.

However, the situation that we have 'here

Prior to that time HEW had not felt itself in a

position to enforce rigidly on the states the rules that it had

Q

In this case you attempted tointervene?

A

Yes.

0

Well, may I ask, Mr.Beytagh, even if the HEW

regulation is valid, contrary to the conclusion of the threejudge court, do I understand your answer to the Chief Justice
to mean this: that if California persists with its regulation,
the only consequence is that it may forfeit its Federal contri­
bution?
A

I don't think that that's the only consequence.

22

1

The. consequence would be that the Secretary would have the

2

option of terminating programs —

Welly I gather —

Whether he, in fact, would do that or not, I

7

before us, not only the question of the validity of the Federal

8

regulation, but assuming that we conclude contrary to the
three-judge court that it is valid, that we must also determine

9

the validity of this state regulation?

10

A

11

1 don't think that's necessary, because they

are so irreconcilable and necessarily in conflict in California

12

and —

13

Q

14

well, I leno*.»

They may bs in conflict, but

doss that, make the California regulation invalid or does it

15

mean only that the

16

may then exercise the option to

cut off the Federal contribution?

17

18
19

20

A

No.

The Secretary is authorised by provisions

of the Act to promulgate rules and regulations to implement it.
He has done this in promulgating this regulation that we have
before us now.

21

22

And I think the District Court —
Q

And if it's valid does that then supercede,

23

24

sc as to make invalid the California regulation?
A

Yes, I think it does, under this —

Q

Well, that goes a little further than just

forfeiture of the Federal contribution, then? doesn’t it?

No„

It seems to me that all that it results

in is that California must have a program as some 40 —
Q

Suppose California says, "We want no part of

your Federal contribution?

They don’t have to take it.

regulation invalid? that's what I'm trying to get at.
A

If the HEW regulation is held valid by this

Court then the California statute is necessarily invalid, since
it's inconsistent that way.
0

It's not invalid if California wants to go on

its own, without any Federal contributions.
A

That's correct, but the likelihood of .

G

Well, then all we hold is that the

Federal regulation is invalid, if we do? that, then, leaves the
Secretary in a position where he could say to California! "How,
you get rid of that regulation of yours or you don't get any
Federal contributions.
A

That's correct, just as in the Alabama case.

Alabama, after King versus Smith, could have, I suppose, said
that it no longer wanted to have anything to do with the
24

t

2

Federal program and gone off and continued to have its sub­
stitute father rule.
Q

3

Well, this isn’t the kind of preemption super-

4

cession, whatever word you want to use, that we ordinarily

5

have when there’s a conflict between a Federal regulation and

6

a state regulation, as in the avocado cases, for example.
i

7

A

Mo; that’s true, but I think we have to look

0

at the thing in context.

9

specifically to apply only in Federal AFDC program cases.

The California statute is written
It

10

was obviously designed for that purpose; that’s the only situa­

11

tion in which it applies.
Now, California, if it didn’t like the HEW regula-

12
13

fcion, could obviously draft another statute, entirely un­

14

related to the Federal program for welfare assistance, but 1

IS

think that, the practical likelihood of that happening .is very

16

remote.

17

Honor knows, and I think that the State simply couldn’t function

18

anywhere near a reasonable level if it didn’t have Federal

matching funds.

It seems to me that the long and short of what

you say is that the Federal Government cannot force the states
to make payments according to its regulations.

A

That5 s correct,

Q

And that's all,

A

That's correct.

But the essenceof this case is

the validity of the regulation promulgated by HEW, which pro­
vides in substance, that only actual support payments, actual
contributions made to AFDC families should be taken into
account in determining the level of need, as Mr. Amsterdam has
•%r

Q

2

I suppose the thrust of these various questions

is that to the effect that this litigation may be premature,,

4

that not until or unless the Secretary of HEM cuts off funds

to California on the basis of his regulation, would that

6

regulation or its validity become a litigable question»

.

A

Q

It would be a harsh approach and contrary to

King against Smith, but certainly there is a great deal of

logic in it? isn't there?

feels is a reasonable regulation, promulgated pursuant to the
