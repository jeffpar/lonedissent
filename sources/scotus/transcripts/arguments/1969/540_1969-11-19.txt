and conditions.

enacted of those conditions, Section 402(a) (33) or Condition 23
of the Social Security Act, whose meaning in this case is criti­
cally in issue.

20

The case is now being appealed to this Court

and other cases are pending in the lower Federal Courts.
The issues in this case, to be sure, are numerous and

18
19

This case arises on one of the most recently

complex.

In my limited time available we should like to take

them up in the following order:
I should like to begin with the meaning of the Federal

21

22

statute.

We believe that meaning is clear on its face, upon its

23

legislative evolution and then discuss the argument made against

24

that meaningi and, third, turn to whether the United States Dis­

25

trict Court may so construe the statute and apply it in New York
2

1
2

and other states.
We begin with the obvious, but important, observation

3

that it is a statute we are construing passed in our national

4

legislative process in which the states are not in the minorities

or unheard voices.

This statute, like all others Acts of Con­

It has, in other words, some intelligi­

We believe that the meaning urged by us in this case
and adopted by the District Judge below is the only meaning
consistent with* the language, its history and consistent with
any intelligible purpose.

The numerous other meanings proffered

13

to this statute by New York, by other states, by the Department

14

of Health, Education, and Welfare reduce congressional rule to

13

a meaningless exercise in futility.

IS

The terms used in the statute are not unheard of or

17

unfamiliar in public assistance administration.

13

to determine the needs of an individual is a comprehensive

29

description of

20

public assistance, to determine how much aid an individual i.s

21

entitled to.

22

23

The amounts use

The second refers to any rnaximums.

Those are the

devices used by states to reduce the amount of aid below that
of state-recognized need.

An adjust to the needs 'standard and am

maximum results — similarly results in a cost-of-living increase
to states with maximums.

That increase is proportionate to the j

extent the state met nerad in a given base period»
By looking to the amounts used and the time they were

6

last established, we first see the.state standard of need during

8

some base period.

of this statute in January 1968.

10
.

That base period is at the time of•enactment

The upshot of the exercise is that states are commandeji

11

to maintain their grant levels with one adjustment to keep pace

12

with living costs by July of 1969.

annual updating of the standard of need, but it also required

21

that all states pay head in full, and there were at that time

22

33 states that did not pay need in full, many of which did not

23

pay more than 50 percent of need and somewhat less.

24
25

It was treated — it was developed in

It; was then an Administration proposal that was
That proposal required not only

,

8

and $95 million for annual updating of standards which were bein

9

paid in full, not the case after.the statute was enacted.

m

The Senate Finance Committee modified that statute,

11

dropping the full need requirement and adding in its stead that

12

any maximum be proportionately adjusted.

13

Senate committee on a party li.ne vote, it was passed by the

14

Senate and went to the Conference Committee, which amended it

15

to drop just one part of it — the annual repricing requirement.

16

The wording of the language of the provision remains the same,

17

It. was passed by aha

however, from the time it emergsd from the Senate Finance Commit

18

tee to the time it was signed by the President on January 2,-

19

1968.

20

Both committees reported the bill out — I am sorry —

21

the Conference Committee and the Senate Finance Committee report- :

22

the bill out under a heading increasing income of recipients.

23

The bill was considered alongside a companion proposal to requir

24

states to increase payments in the adult programs, by an average

23

increase of $7.50, and the method chosen for that increase was

1*

the adjustment of need standard and maximams„;

2

Xt is, in short, we think history makes several things

3

Olear»

4

tradition insofar as it requires a modest adjustment to.state

5

need and payment levels in AFDC, which is self-evident, and quite

6

obvious to the specialist committees dealing with that security

7

.legislation and certainly obvious to any Congressman who took

8

the time to look at it.

One, the 402(a) (23) is a self-evident departure from

Two, the evolution of the bill makes clear that it
10

was a compromise»

It was not to establish the floor of incomes

n

in every state that would approach "adequacy" as the Administra-j

12

tion had. originally urged.

13

was to see that each state paid what it was then paying, which

14

was knovm for all states to be inadequate, and to make one adjua

15

ment to keen pace with living costs.

Nothing of the kind.

It, rather.

n

It should be added that the Administration reported to

17

the committees that most states had updated it in .1965 and 1957.

18

There was no great impact expected from the required updating

19

by July 1, 1959, particularly once state maximums were accepted.
i

20

We think this legislative history also makes clear the!

21

— that the companion proposal makes clear that Congress appre- '

22

dates the effect of adjusting these mechanisms.

23

chosen,, the comprehensive term used• to describe tha need standarj

24

plus the fact it goes to require adjustment to maximums leaves

25

little room for nullification or evasion.

1

6

The language

!

Andy finally, we think that the fact that Congress

2

made this a planned condition for continued participation in

3

AFDC and gave the states one year and a half to make the

4

required adjustments, I think, makes that Congress intended to

5

compel the states to do what the statute says.

6

Q

You mean to compel fee states —* they would not

7

be free to simply ignore the Federal provision and perhaps accept

8

the loss of Federal assistance?

A

For some reason the state is permitted to imple­

as

ment it prior to HEWs approval and Federal funds continue to

VI

flow and then there is a series of discussions and negotiations ;

18

which take place between the state and HEW over the change if

19

it raises questions.

20

This provision was doomed to raise questions and HEW

21

in somewhat uncharacteristic switch fashion replied to New York

22

that Section 131-a, the statute which reduces grant, raised

23

the question of conformity under the Social Security Act, "Would

24

you provide us with, information?"

23

That was in April.

New York provided the regulations

nothing further has been heard between HEW and the State of New ;
Yorkt except for an event that we just learned about recently
that took place on November j0 P in which HEW wrote New York a

I

letter questioning some other aspect of 131-a on the question ot\
statewide uniformity under the Social Security Act.
Q

I

Is this issue ripe for judicial decision and for

that procedure?
A

Mr, Justice Brennan, it is our view that the'

delegation to HEW

of

the power to cut off Federal funds does

not preclude the remedy that this Court upheld in Sing against
.

Smith.

That remedy was a recipient most affected by state plan j

We have a somewhat shorter history of negotiation herd.
But given the nature of the interests involved and also the fact:
that HEW8s participation or expertise being relevant, is avail- j
able to this Court or the court below.

Indeed, HEW has very

explicitly expressed its views in this case and those were before
the District Court in its brief from another case and the regu­
lation —

or two of the critical .issues and doesn't purport to be answer- :

4

It doesn't and HEW was invited to participate in

thxs case at the beginning»
Q

6

But it says in its brief in this Court that it

7

doesn’t purport to be telling us whether this is just a. stream­

8

lining of the state standard or, on the other hand, whether it

9

is forbidden as an impermissible reduction in the content of the:

20

standard.

That is the critical issue, isn't it?

A

c2

Q

That is one of the critical issues.

.

I

Well, they just advised us on that and apparently,

!

•

13

they haven't advised anything on that yet.
A

*4

That is quite often the case, Mr. Justice Whits.
(

15

This really advised the Court, for example, it did not advise

16

the Court or anyone else in King against Smith exactly what its

17

position on "substitute father" rules were.

!
. 1

18

Q

Maybe it isn't ready to do yet.

19

A

Mr. Chief Justice, it certainly — it is meander-j

20

ing along a protracted series of negotiations, of very indefinite

21

negotiations, which is certainly a characteristic of that pro­

22
23
24
25

cess.

It is not an adversary process.
Recipients are not parties to it and states are not

really adversaries except in the rare instance where HEW invokes
its power of cutoff.

And, as we have said, it is very rare that

11

I*.

1

it. invokes that rule.

2

Q

Are you suggesting that there.'is a burden upo?

the Court to act if the administrative function is delayed?
4

A

Not all, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

Q

Delayed or —

6

A

No, l*m sorry.

I am saying that the power of HEW

7

to order cutoff of Federal funds does not affect the right of

S

recipients to come into Federal Court and adjudicate validity

under the Federal act of a state law, regulation or statute

10

that adversely affects them.

The courts have power to adjudicate validity.

The United States itself has
It has come into

We think that power is critical and very important.
We mention the nature of these negotiations only to show how
critical and important that power is if the planned conditions

22

that Congress impose are to be enforced.

If in fact the pro™

tections t the few protections that Congress provide t

I should like, first, to return to the statute and

raous. change in the Federal-state relationships, unpree.:dented
in grant-in-aid programs at considerable compelled, expenditures
and without stormy opposition in Congress that such a measure
should have resulted in.
We think the argument falls in each of those premises.

19

The costs of this provision were before the Congress.

20

that the Administration's original provision,, requiring a great

21

deal more change, would cost overall $90 million in Federal fund

22

for full payment of updated standards.

Federal expenditures.

It is because, what New York has done, it has cut grant!

Congress was thinking about when it passed this statute.

given violation of a Federal condition can "be cbstly if one take!

18

the condition in King against Smith, against a state, for example

19

New York tried to withdraw aid to all children whose parents

20

had abandoned them and those petitioners invoked 402(a)|1©>.

That is not the thrust of what

The cost in that case was about $200 million.

Any-

That

22

was not the cost that Congress estimated for 402(a)(10}.or had

23

in mind, although it did pass that provision to deal with fiscal

24

crises in the states.

25

My point is that the costs are, indeed, modest.

15

Too,

this is not unprecedented in grand-.in~aid programs»

It is.not the concern of the statute, its proponent or anyone
else who discussed it never talked about streamlining.

One

should add that, there is no Federal statute or regulation that
defines what "streamlining” is either.
The states have, like New York, provided several
methods of providing grants.

One of those methods is to provide

the grant as a supplement, as it does, for example, for rent
today, and as it did for articles of home furnishings and cloth­
ing.

We don't think that 402(a)(23) allows the states to elimi-

nate whatever items it now deems unnecessary.

King against Smith, not only in the question of the unrightness

case than King against Smith.

21

The complete absence of a constitutional claim, such

Do you have anything like that?

A

Hew York pays 100 percent of the standard of need

It always has, in contrast to many states which don’t, and
shockingly I think some states have a higher standard of head
than New York.

For example, although New York pays an average

of $278 per month to a family of four on welfare, and we pay
the same whether it is AFDC or aid to the aged or blind, dis­
abled or whatever.
In Missouri the standard of need is a substantially
higher figure, $305, but the actual amount paid is only $124»

18

Now New York simply doesn't do that.

19

that and we pay 10$ of the standard of need.

20

We have never indulged in

Indeed Section 131 of our Social Service's law, which

21

is our statute, which antedated 131-a, the one this case deals

22

with, which is still on the books, says, "Insofar as funds are

23

available for that purpose, New York is to provide adequately

24

for those unable to maintain themselves»11

25

what New York has always lived up to.
26

And that is precisely

We have repriced every year.

In August'of 1968, prior to 13.3.-a when the levels were

family of four.

The Legislature

15

took an average of the age of the oldest child in order to

16

eliminate the vast administrative paperwork and the time of

17

Social Services officials which went to figuring out what the

18

age of the oldest child was in any given family.

19

dealing with hundreds of thousands of families, the Court can

20

appreciate the time-consuming nature of that job in addition to

21

the readjustments? every time the oldest child in a family reach©

22

another year, that placed the family in another 'bracket..

of the special grants, ahd this was done on the basis of the

enlightened judgment of everybody in the field, every enlightened,

commentator including HEW itself, which as early as 1964 called

14

on the states to eliminate the special grants.
What "special grants" means is as we have described

them in our brief.

And if there is any dispute about this,

ifc is that the recipient of welfare has go hat in hand to the

What special grants are put out?

Special grants go to specific items such as movin'

expenses, Justice Brennan, a diet for somebody who is a diabetic

things of that nature„

2
3

Q

Are these things which were eliminatae!, is that

it, from the computation of the gross payments?

A

They- were' eliminated, but they are still availahl

4

to the welfare recipient personally because the figure of $25

5

per month was tacked on to the average in 1969 in order to com­

6

pensation for the elimination of special grants, and also because
i

7

many of these grants, such as moving and a security deposit for j

10

other words, tv-hare the local or state Social Services Department!

simply furnishes the service itself by purchasing it for a con­

12

tractor or from the landlord, where that is applicable.

m

But while these special, grants were always over and

above the standard of need and the elimination, although it has

15

been compensated for anyway, doesn't, in any way detract or

16

reduce the standard of need.

17

18

Q

Nonetheless, many of these items

Well, but I gather basically on the question of

conflict with the Federal regulation you would say that there

What was the major purpose of 131-a?

what is the basis for determining welfare payments for the indi­
vidual case to general categories?
A

Is that one of them?

Well, Justice White, ifc was streamlining in the

elimination of the ——

Q

No r I know, but what does "streamlining” mean?

A

It was basically two things.

It was the elimina-j

tion of special grants for the reasons that I have said, the
administrative simplicity, taking the burden off of the back of
the welfare recipients who go and apply for special grants ,
which benefits the more aggressive recipient at the expense of
the jmeak, and also frees the counsellors, who don't have to
fool around now with the investigation of each individual request
for a special grant.

They can now devote their time to counsel­

ling and finding jobs and everything else that k counsellor
can do *
And the other thing was the averaging, which eliminate
the paperwork and the delay and time-consuming aspects of paying
a different amount for each child»
Q

In short, you don’t determine an individual need:

A

Well, we still determine individual needs, but

we do it under a formula which ‘was simplified — in no way

32

i

<a

5

reduced, but simplified., so that how much a family of four gets

2

now doesn't depend on whether the oldest child in that family is]

5

the state, which isn’t involved in this case.

6

portion of this case that was mooted out,

It is now a ."set amount for a family

That was the

7

Q

But it simplifies administration?

3

A

Yes, sir.

9

Now when you look at 602 (a) (23), as we have to in o.rde

10

to try to glean what Congress meant when it passed it, we sea

n

that, first of all, it is a very minor part of Section- -602 of

12

the Social Security Act and the supremacy clause, although my

13

colleague here adverts to it. clearly, isn’t relevant, to this

14

case because Congress has simply never exercise any real author: Y

15

over the levels of welfare allowances paid by the state.

16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Indeed, 601 of the Social Security Act, which is the
basic statute, which provides the Federal grants-in-aid in the
field of AFDC, says the states ought to furnish assistance as
far as practicable under the conditions in each state.

And

what that means, in effect, is that we have seen that New York
pays $278 a month, Missouri pays $124, Mississippi pays $55 a
month and even the District of Columbia, where Congress .itself
sets the standard, pays $184 a month on the average, which is
about two-thirds of what New York pays.

after 602(a)(23) was enacted by the 867 Congress, this Court

3

said each state is free to determine the level of benefits by

9

the amount of funds it devotes to the program.
The statute requires an increase in the standard of

10
n

need.

12

by that by its repricing in 1963 and it has again repriced in.

13

1969.

14

There is no question about that and Itfew Yoric complied

The bill when it was originally introduced by the

15

Administration made significant changes which never took effect,

13

because Congress didn't see it the way HEW saw it.

17

as introduced, required each state to pay the full standard of

13

need, which as we see will be a gigantic step forward in the

19

whole administration of welfare.

20

to the count we took — don't, even pay their own acknowledged

21

standard of need.

22

And many states

In effect, they say to a family, "We know you need

$300 a month, or whatever it is, but we are not. going to give ye
$300 a month."
The bill also required an annual adjustment standard

34

of need and since it required each state to pay the standard of

1
2

needf it required an annual adjustment of the amount actually

3

'paid to every AFDC recipient,,

.

This would have been a bill of an enormous impact, but

S

the House turned it down and the Senate, while passing a portion

6

of it, only passed the annual updating part.

7

10

n
12

And so, in effect.,

when it finally got through, it was emasculated and than the
House-Senate Conference Committee further emasculated it by
eliminating the annual updating and leaving it as it is with a
simple one-shot updating of the standard of neeed requirement
and no requirement at all that a state increase the amount
actually paid.

In effect. Congress was indicating that it would

And of course since then, as

No, sir. although unquestionably it did comply-

with what Congress said.

It is evident from the legislative history here,

The petitioners have tried to avoid that problem by
saying that the pendent jurisdiction doctrine gets then over

in United Mineworkers Against Gibbs, and as the lower Federal

it in one of the cases.
And that is simply what we have here.

So pending

jurisdiction is of no assistance to the petitioners.
They rely on 1331, but it is clear that they don't

have $10,000 here to talk about, and as this Court held in

Snyder against Harris, individual plaintiffs in a cross-suit

can't aggregate their claims in order to try to reach the $10.,00j3

requirement.

S

They also rely on 1343 and 42 USC 1968, the classic

Civil Rights statute, but the fallacy there, as the: Court of

What it is is a statute which perpetuate really an inequity.

into the extraordinarily inequitable amounts of welfare assist­
