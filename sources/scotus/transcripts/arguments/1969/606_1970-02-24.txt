Court:

Before proceeding with argument, afc the suggestion

10

of the Office of the Clerk this morning, I was informed that

1?

correspondence from Respondent’s attorney failed to reach the

12

Court that was dated February 20, 1970.

13

he asked that -the Court please disregard the second argument

14

entitled, "The Case is Moot".

15

entertain that and unless there are questions in that .regard,

16

the Petitioner will stand on his brief on that point.

18

To the extent that the Court will,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We well take note of that,

Mr. Flaum.

1

Now, 101 years later, the People of the State of

2

Illinois ask this Court to review and reverse the Court of

3

Appeals of the Seventh Circuit's decision in Illinois v. Allen

4

Allen was indicted for armed robbery in 1956, tried

5

in Criminal Court of Cook County, Illinois, and sentenced to

8

a term of 10 to 30 years in the penitentiary»

7

on parole, and I am informed, a parole violator.

9

He is presently

From the beginning of the trial, Allen insisted on
his right to question jurors on voir dire examination.

He

10

embarked on a deliberate and knowing course of disruption, out­

ii

bursts , and threats which finally culminated in his removal from

12

the courtroom during most of the presentation, of the State's case.

13

We contend the facts are not in dispute.

14

Q

Was he present for some part of the trial?

15

A

He was present, Your Honor, for the entire

18

defense; in fact, relative calm was to obtain when the defense

17

began its presentation.

18

examination which he was conducting.

He was taken out during the voir dire

19

Q

So he was not there for the opening?

20

A

He was not there for the opening.

21

Q

Nor for any evidence in the State's case?

22

A

Not in the State’s case.

He was given opportun­

23

ity to come back immediately after the voir dire and immediately

24

before the presentation of the State's case.

25

An invitation was

extended by the trial judge through counsel to have him return.

By both the State and the defense?
Yes, by both.

17

in dispute is that a reading of the Court of Appeals, even in

18

its majority opinion, as well as the dissent in the Seventh

19

Circuit in the per curiam opinion of the Illinois Supreme Court

20

clearly are in agreement on the nature of the conduct here.

the ten reviewing judges who have had an opportunity to examine

22

the record, all ten agreed on conduct.

25

Of

Only two felt constrained

Just briefly, the Respondent threatened the lifa of

1

the trial judge, ripped his attorney's files and harangued the

2

court in such a way that the judge felt his removal was

3

necessary.
I might add that -there was warning in all of these case

4
5

From the commentators on this area, I suggest if this rule of

6

exclusion is allowed, that it be appropriately done in those

7

areas where there are warnings.
The Court of Appeals in its majority opinion found

8
9

adequate warning by the trial judge, and, I suggest, there was

10

more than one warning included in the admonitions from the

11

trial court for the Respondent to remain silent.

12

Q

How long did the whole trial take?

13

A

Mr. Justice Harlan, I believe the trial took

14

approximately two-and-a-half days.

It was a jury trial; it was

15

a simple case of an armed robbery of a tavern.

16

fled by the bartender.

Allen was identi

In turn, Allen identified the victim.

The defense was insanity and a yaar-and-a-haif before,

17
18

the defendant had been declared incompetent.

19

restored and his defense of insanity was rejected by the trier

20

of facts.

25

He had been

We are here today because we feel™”~ We have asked
this Court to review, because we do not believe that the
Constitution of the United States compels the result which the
Seventh Circuit, reluctantly, I might add, arrived at.
feel that the right of confrontation, through its
6

1

birth in the common law and its adoption by the Sixth Amendment,

2

certainly wasn't meant to broaden the exceptions that the

3

common law recognised.»

4

And this Court, in 1926 in Salinger vs. the United

5

States, specifically mentioned that while the common law was

6

brought into the purview of the Sixth Amendment's right of

7

confrontation, it certainly wasn't meant to make exceptions not

8

included in that new amendment.
This Court had, in Dias vs, the United States in

3
10

1912, clearly addressed itself to the issue of waiver.

In

11

that case ~ a murder case out of the Philippines, tried under

12

the Philippine Code ---• the Court concluded that what they were

13

reviewing was a substantial equivalent of the Sixth Amendment.
The issue in Dias as presented, or the claim mads,

14
15

was that the Supreme Court — in the Supreme Court here --

16

that he did not waive the right of confrontation, but that he

17

could not waive it.
This Court held that waiver was possible, was

18
19

permissible, and did obtain in that case.

20

defendant voluntarily left the court; he sent a message to the

21

presiding judge that he would not return.
The significant, we feel, in this case are two

25

In that case the

tilings;

1) The Davis Case, which was the only direct American

precedent other than a prior Illinois case in 1956 on this
point, was mentioned in Dias favorably.

7

And what is

i

1

significant is that in Dias they are reciting Davis which was

z

an involuntary removal case,,
We feel that if waiver is recognized, certainly in

3
4

the waiver by an escapee from a courtroom, that the unruly

5

defendant is not to be accorded treatment different than the

$

escapee,

7

or escapes waives his right to be present and that the trial

8

can continue.

Diaz makes it clear that & defendant who walks out

We believe there is no difference between a defendant

9
10

who walks out of the courtroom and a defendant who is

11

ordered removed because his courtroom conduct makes a fair

12

and orderly trial impossible.

13

former case, we think there is waiver in the latter.

If there is waiver in the

On the issue of whether waiver has been recognized,

14

15

our research indicates that only the Davis Case in 1869, two

16

English cases, one a felony case, one a misdemeanor case -—

17

Rex v, Browne, Regina V,» Berry — also in the 19th century.

18

But it has never been rejected by a court of review, as we

19

can find.

20
21

22
23
24
25

Further, we suggest that this Court in dictum in
the Diaz Case and in a subsequent case in Snyder vs, Massachu­
setts has adopted the waiver principle and that the dictum
allows for its application here,
I might add that in dictum in Snyder vs, Massachusetts,

"No doubt the privilige (the

Though in the Snyder vs. Massachusetts

I am just wondering, is the correct analysis

7

really of waiver or that one may forfeit the right to be

8

present by misconduct?

9

this respondent protested his removal in the beginning.

In this instance, as I understand it,

10

A

Yes, he did, Your Honor.

1!

Q

Now really, he wasn’t absent voluntarily in

12

that sense was he.

13

A

Ho.

14

Q

And we have dealt with waiver, haven’t we,

15

ordinarily in terms of a voluntary relinquishment of a known

16

right?

17

A

I thrnk that is true, Your Honor.

18

Q

Then why isn’t this really a question whether

19

the constitutional rights have been forfeited by misconduct?

20

Isn’t that, at least, moi-e realistic and, perhaps, more honest

21

analysis?

A

22

If I might disagree to .an extent, Mr. Justice

23

Brennan, I feel the waiver is applicable in this case for this

24

reason.

25

this case was on® of not a lack of communication.

The dialogue between the judge and the defendant in

They seemed

to be understanding.

2

Certainly when one reads the record in this case, the defendant

3

had no problem in making his intentions known.

very tolerant judge,

in this instance.
We find the commentators# while acknowledging

15

in their feeling# at least of this ruling# that removal is

16

the appropriate remedy.
We# in our study# found that the development of the

right to be present was early cast in jurisdictional terms.

19

And we suggest that if it has any vitality today# it may only

20

be# perhaps# in capital cases

Q

Do you say removal is the remedy or one of the

24

suggest that we just broaden the trial judge's discretion to

been permitted by lower courts s binding and gagging.

feeling is that it doesn’t fall outside binding and gagging.

You might lock it up.

question whether the right of confrontation is any better

21

brings a disservice to the court in which, this action takes

place.
Q

23

Would you mind stating briefly the facts which

24

you claim we must find from the facts the man did in the

25

courtroom?
11

I

A

Mr. Justice Black,- in this case below, the

2

defendant at the outset announced his unwillingness merely

3

to participate in the trial processes.

He informed the judge—-

4

Q

To do what?

5

A

He would not partieiapte in the trial, not in

6

a voluntary' fashion.

He informed the court, "You have a right

7

to restrain me, but you haven't got. the right to remove me,

8

and you're not going to remove me."

9

"1811 determine that."

And the court replied,

The defendant, "No you're not5 there's

10

not going to be a trial.

11

going to talk, and you can bring out your shackles and straight

12

jacket and put them on me and tape my mouth, but it will do no

13

good, because there's going to be no trial."
Q

14

IS

X5m going to sit here, and you're

At one point he said the judge was going to be

a corpse, didn't he?
A

16

Yes, he did.

Prior to noon recess -— 1 again

17

stress very strongly, Your Honors, how tolerant this trial judge

!8

was — the defendant announced that the judge would be a

19

corpse upon the defense1 return from lunch recess.

20

Q

Was he out on bail or in custody?

21

A

He was in custody. Your Honor.

22

Q

Well, that was slightly a vain threat, wasn't

24

A

The record is vague, but there is some indicatior

25

that when this defendant left the courtroom and went

23

it?

12

1

into the anteroom, he tended to be a little physical with the

2

property in the •--

3
4

Q

Well, that, is what I would say, and isn't your

position just to say that in the courtroom he could be violent?

3

A

Yes »

Q

You don't have to argue that this is better than

1

shackling do you?

It is on the same level?

Bentvena, yes.

Well, I think exclusion is a

much more preferable remedy to that and much milder.
Q

There is a Court of Appeals in the District of

20

Columbia Circuit which reversed that conviction, because the

21

Court shackled and gagged the defendant»

22

remedies should have been taken.

23

A

I thought other

Mr. Chief Justice, that is our view.

The

24

shackling and gagging — what it is fraught with is the peril

25

of prejudice to the existing procedure in addition to the
13

1

disrupt!'ve conduct that may be taking place by the defendant’s

action»

3

0

Now -tills disruptive conduct began at the very

4

moment that the proceedings opened,, before they had picked a

5

jury, didn’t it?

6

In fact, fir. Chief Justice, it preceded that»

In pre-trial before another judge of the Cook Comity Circuit

Court, where he made a motion for a substitution of judges based

9

on prejudice, he again there caused some sort of a scene»

So

10

you can trace it back there.

and, we suggest, on no provocation.

12

of any dialogue between the prosecutor and the defendant.

13

there is no act on the part of the State apart from the judge

in incurring the wrath of the defendant by any spoken word or

15

any opening statement or the like.

16

But, yes, this started immediately,
There is an absence totally
So

Your Honors, we would add one other fact, and that is

discretion in a trial judge, that is a weighty problem.

subject to appropriate review, of the opportunity to expect —

Q

How­

with

I don’t quite understand your analogy? -that

who could be entrusted with what?
A

Mr. Justice Stewart, our position is this.
14

We

i

recognise we are asking for the recognition of a broad

2

discretion in a trial judge,, and recognizing that in any dis­

3

cretion case -there is a chance that review is always difficult

4

because the area of discretion is quite often treated by Courts

5

of Appeals in very limited fashion, entrusting great belief

that a trial judge normally acts very fairly.

7

is not a .low visibility situation.

tool of a judge annoyed with the look or the talk of a

We are trying to weigh the

defendant.
Q

11

Certainly, I suppose General Flaum, all would

12

agree that a trial judge is entrusted with great discretion

13

in what procedures he is going to follow in keeping order and

14

decorum in his courtroom.

15

But here we have a complaint of a violation of a specific

16

constitutional right, i.e. the right of confrontation.

17

fact that there is great discretion really doesn5t meet the

18

claim of your adversary.
A

19

There is no question about that.

So the

On that specific point, Mr. Stewart, 1 would

20

agree.

However, on the violation of constitutional rights:

2!

Constitutional right, commentators and this Court have

22

recognized, is mainly to insure the opportunity for cross-

23

examination and, as a collateral benefit of that, the oppor­

24

tunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses.

Isn't that a clear indication

We feel, Mr. Chief Justice, that is one of three

clear indications.

We have a record that it seems to roe is patently

clear in the attempt by the judge to bring the defendant around

to a reasonable conduct and the declared decision by the defen­

out significant — until the defense began, and than there

6

was calm.

7

that he realised that his conduct was improper.

8

to us a certain reflective process that he probably had through­

9

out the trial, but just chose to use in one case.

In fact, we found the defendant stating in effect

It connotes

How many times did the court warn him?
We find at least three, and perhaps four.

12

fourth one, Mr. Chief Justice, has to be a reading into a

statement -that doesn’t include the word warn.

Well, this man is

ZZ

Q

I mean legally free, not illegally as he is now.

23

A

Right.

He is on parole.

If this Court were to

24

affirm the Court of Appeals, he would be no longer subject to

25

any of the vital consequences that stem from a parole violator,

1

and he has a year or so or more to go.

2

Q

As you read the Court of Appeals decision, if

3

this same matter comes up tomorrow in Cook County, how could the

4

judge legally handle it?

5

A

Well, as I read the Coxirt of Appeals, Your Honor,

6

we feel that he can either try to make a contempt citation or

7

he has to bind and gag him.

8

we had the unsightly scene of a bound and gagged defendant

9

recently with a federal marshall placing his hand in front of

10

the gag so that no words would come forward through the gag.
Q

11

Wow in the Second Circuit, we didn't have that

trouble.

13

Appeals upheld it.

14

In my jurisdiction and in my city

Wien he was gagged, he was gagged.

I am familiar with that case.

And the Court of

I would suggest,

IS

Mr. Justice Marshall that it is our view that not only must

IS

justice be done, but there ought to be the appearance of justice.

17

And if I am right in that assumption, we do a tremendous

18

disservice to promoting that kind of a scene and rewarding

19

conduct which in no way one can sympathize with.

20

If we have got an incompetent defendant, they he

21

shouldn't be on trial.

22

deliberate act of volition, as it was in this case, it is very

23

hard not to find that the limits to the constitutional right

24

had been exhausted.

23

Q

But certainly one which is a pure,

former the way you began, but then when you begin talking about

4

how he really did have the right of cross-examination through

S

counsel and that •—*

6

A.

We acknowledge in the strictest sense, Mr.

7

Justice Stewart, that there was a classic denial if the denial

8

of the right of confrontation presupposes never removing a

9

defendant from the view of the actual trial scene.

We acknow­

11

was what commentators have suggested are meaningful benefits

12

of the right of confrontation were not totally denied when he

13

had counsel continuing to go forward with the cross-examination»

What I was suggesting perhaps, not so clearly,

14

Q

But your argument is that he waived it?

15

A

That he waived it.

16

Q

And you do concede that it was technically

17

violated?

If he had not waived it, it was violated?
A

18

Yes; it was violated.

The removal is a technical

19

violation, if one can call into play what violation by our

20

waiver.

21

22

Q

Had there been no waiver, it would have been

a violation?

23

A

It would have been a violation.

24

Q

As I read the Supreme Court of Illinois opinion,

25

they didn’t say that it was a waiver, but that his conduct
19

i

operated as a waiver.

2

A

Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

Q

They equated it to a waiver rather than saying

4

that it was a waiver?

S

A

Is that about the way they put it?

Correct.

I would imagine that I have been

s

opposing simply because as a trial lawyer I am used to the

7

waiver of the signed paper of a jury waiver or whatever.

you are absolutely correct.

That is why we have leaned toward the waiver conduct.

you say it is equated to a waiver,, is that you arrive at the

A

Yes, Your Honor.

It has the operative

Perhaps, we should have

prefaced our claims of waiver as effective as a waiver.

We

just felt it would not be misleading to offer up to this Court

from one of application, if accepted by the Court.

corner of a bar where no one was around.

Allen said, "I want the money."

A few hours later Allen was apprehended.

He was

searched.

No gun, but approximately $200 was found on his

11

presense.

The officer said, “Where did you get the money?"

12

And Allen said, "'Oh, I robbed this bar this evening."

13

that he was taken to the police station, and, subsequently,

14

there was a line-up.

15

With

When Allen was walked in with several other suspects

16

to be viewed by the owner of the bar and the bartender, both of

17

whom were in the bar when the robbery occurred, before he

could be identified, Allen said, "Hey, I recognize you.

Q

How is this relevant, now, on our issue?

A

Because I. am trying to expleiin Allen’s behavior.

Allen was then indicted and while in jail, there were several
attempted suicides.

Allen had a prior mental history.

Back

in the early 50's he was committed and served some time in a
mental hospital.

It was determined that he could not cooperate with his

Q

But that issue is out of this case now, in a

sense, isn't it?
A

No; but I think it is important for the Court

7

to realise the type of person who Allen was and what the trial

8

judge was confronted with,

9

in the warning realized that he was dealing with a person who

I don't feel that tine trial judge

10

had a prior mental history and, although the issue is not

it

before this Court, may not have been, in full control of his

12

faculties at -the time he was tried.

13

The fact that you may say to someone, "If you don't

14

sit down and be quiet, you are going to be removed" and warn

15

him once or twice, and he continues to disrupt the proceedings,

16

and to remove that person, that is different than dealing

17

with a person who has complete control of his faculties who, may

18

realize what the court is saying.

23

Q

Take five minutes out and explain to

I would suggest that he go and ask the defendant,

24

"How do you want me to run the trial?”

Is that what you mean?

25

In that situation the judge had a choice, according to the

Do you suggest gagging

A

10

Well, I suggest the possibility of closed-circuit

11

televising the trial to another room where again he can see the

12

proceedings „

13

Q

What about gagging?

14

A

1 feel that if the court will not accept closedf

15

circuit television or a booth, then he should be gagged; he

15

should remain in court*

17

and he can't talk to his attorney, he can still hear what is

IS

going on,

19

Because even though ha is gagged

It is completely different for a defendant to be in

20

court and to hear what is going on, so that at recess he can

21

talk to -this attorney, rather than trying to read a transcript

22

during a recess and tell him what should or should not happen

23

or should be said in cross-examination,

24
25

Q

Well, now certainly, you do not contest that

the government has a right to try an accused, doesn’t it?
31

1.

A

Yes, sir.

2

Q

These are just safeguards .about the accused to

3

see that he gets 'the kind of trial the Constitution guarantees.

4

A

That is correct.

5

Q

But certainly he has to recognize the govern-

6

merit!s right to try him, doesn't he?

?

A

Yes.

8

Q

Doesn't that suggest that he may then by his

9
10

misconduct that he prevent
A

the government from trying him?

I do not believe that we can permit or a court

11

should permit a defendant, to disrupt the trial, to cause a

12

mistrial, to delay the trial by conduct.

13

right to be in court is mandatory so he can see what is happen­

14

ing and confer with his attorney.

15

I feel that his

If he attempts to purposely disrupt the court, I do

16

not think that a contempt sentence is going to be effective.

17

Because, assuming a series of contempt convictions over a period

18

of time, and during this time there may be witnesses who could

19

testify who will now no longer be available.

20

through indirection he may be serving 3 or 4 contempt terms and

21

avoid serving a much more serious term for the charges brought

22

against him.

23

And, thereby,

I think that there are more effective ways of gagging

24

and binding a defendant rather titan the one which was used in

25

the recent trial in Chicago of the seven defendants.
32

Bobby

'I

Seale was chained with a sort of make-shift gag on his mouth.

2

Had the court used a strait jacket and a hospital gag as was

3

used in a recent Ohio trial, the defendant would have been

4

immobile, and he wouldn’t have been able to bite through the

5

gag and utter noises to disrupt the proceedings.

6

Q

I take it if you have a number of defendants

7

who are equally obstreperous, your thought would be that each

8

would have to have his own cubicle, the State would have to

9

provide one, is that it?

A

10

A cubicle I think is impractical, because as

11

was done in the sanity hearing in California, when the

52

defendant got in the cubicle, as a last effort to disrupt the

13

proceedings, he then pretended to be asleep for the entire

54

hearing.

15

Q

Which lasted 2 or 3 weeks?

16

A

X think a closed-circuit television is mobile,

17

it could be set up in the court, and the cost is nominal. Every

18

bank and savings and loan association of the country have

19

closed-circuit television«

20
21
22

Q

The trouble is that doesn't preserve his right

to confrontation.
A

Yes, but at least he will be seeing the

23

witnesses, and he will be able to communicate with his attorney

24

arid tell him how to cross-e&ami&e them».

25

Q

But it does not preserve his right to
33

1

con fronteti OB .

2

1%

Well, that depends on how the right of confronta­

3

tion is defined.

4

1 think the purposes were 1) s© he can face tha witness and

5

cross-examine him.

6

see the witness and reflect on his demeanor and his testimony.

7

1 don’t think either of these rights would be violated, if

Q

9

He is to confront 'them for what purpose?

There is a second reasons so the jury can

Suppose he is put in the separate room or in

10

11

telephone — which sometimes happens— is out-of-order for 15

12

minutes.

13

Do we have to have a new trial?
A

No; because I think there should be a marshall

14

in the room with the defendant who could — if -the phone is

15

out-of-order — very simply communicate via runner to the

18

court that the phone’s not working, that they must get a

17

repairman in and will recess for 10 or 15 minutes.

18
19

Q

But if he didn’t do it, you would have to have

a new trial?

20

A

No.

Q

But he didn’t have the right of confrontation

He would still have an opportunity to see what

This seems to be -the theory that this mentally-
