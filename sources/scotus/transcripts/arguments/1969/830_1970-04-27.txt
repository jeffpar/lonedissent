ARGUMENT OF VINCENT J. GROGAN

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

9

MR* GROGAN:

Mr* Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
This criminal matter is before the Court on writ of

iO

certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit»

ft

Constitutional questions presented are whether petition was

12

denied effective assistance of counsel where he met his

13

lawyer in the hallway on the way to the courtroom for trial on

i4

serious criminal charges»

13

It also involves the constitutional question of

IS

whether a warrantless, search of an automobile in which the

17

petitioner was a passenger which was made while he was in

t8

custody in a police station, after the car had been moved from,

?9

the scene of arrest to the police station, and where there had

20

been two previous searches of the same automobile»

21

It also involves the question of harmless error in

22

connection with the admission into evidence of dum-dum bullets

23

which were illegally seised and then used in trial to connect

2.4

the petitioner with weapons that were found in the warrantless

25

search of the car, and also used to describe the severity of

2

!
ft.

&
3
4

5

impact that could be made by such bullets to petitioner *s
detriment»
The statement of the case in our bief is extensive,,
and I will try to summarise it more briefly for the Court *
It opens with the statement:

During the first week

6

of September 1963, petitioner and three co^defendants were

7

tried on four criminal charges.

8

of preparation of my brief

9

Mias Los -» that the record of this trial has become available

I find now* since the time

and 1 have advised my opponent9

10

to me and that that trial did not involve four criminal

11

charges but9 rathere two„

12

It appears that the. indictment that was presented to

'13

the court and jury in that case involved solely the alleged

14

robbery of a service station on May 2Qf 1963s

"5

that become apparente this is very important to our case»

S

17

And„ for reasons
I

would lilce to offer this to the Court at this time»
At the trial9 in early September 19639 petitioner

"8

was represented by a member of the Legal Aid Society of

IS

Pittsburgh»

Yes, 1 believe we could say that, Your Honor®

Your Honor3 the record doesn’t disclose that

and that is all we have to deal with at the present timeu

18

The -* Q

19

Well, we have another factor, don®t we?

The

20

ordinary human experience in the practice and habits of

21

lawyers that two lawyers associated in the same organisation,

22

'

whether it be a law firm or the Legal Aid Society, would

23

reasonably be in communication with each other about a case

24

when one is transferred to another and they build up a file

25

on itv

Aren’t there some assumptions that can be made about
5

!

that, on the basis of experience?

2
3

A

Your Honor, I don8t know whether those assump­

tions warrant in the circumstances of this case»

4

Q

Do you know that they are ««»

5

A

If I may speak outside the record* I believe

©

so*

7

connection with the case; and I believe they would show very ,

8

very little to assist a lawyer in a second trial in' the same

9

charges,

I have obtained copies of the Legal Aid Society files in

Additionally, we have the problem here that I have

IO
ii

been operating under the assumption

12

volved all four counts, whereas we find now that it only in®

13

volved two counts for one of the two robberies that he was

14

cliarged with and tried, in September*

18

Q

Was there an evidenciary hearing on this, in

A

There was an evidenciary hearing held in the

the

State Court, Your Honor, but was very brief*

10

Q

Were you at that?

20

A

No, I was not*

21

ZZ
23
24
25

that the first trial in«

I was appointed by this court

to represent the petitioner*
Q

But there has been a habeas corpus petition

hearing on the inadequacy of counsel?
A

Not in the federal system, Your Honor*

it is not a full hearing*

Also

Part of our contention is that
6

1

under Townsend vs„ Sain, there was not arx adequate factfinding

E

hearing by the State Court». as the material facts are not dis«*
closed in this records,

The record of the habeas corpus hearing !

appears in the appendix®

It shows that petitioner took the

stand, he was asked when he met his counsel, and testified that ■

6

he met him in the hallway on the way to the courtroom®

7

not asked any questions in connection with what other prepara-

He was

V

8

tion there was, whether he discussed it with him or not®

9

only other, thing touching on the fact was that petitioner said

that at some point in time between the time that he was incar­

1!

cerated and the first trial that a. member of the Legal Aid

12

Society staff apparently came to the prison to talk to him®

two Negroes walked into a service station and demanded all of

Testimony further disclosed that around 11:30 o’clock

pum„f on May 20* two teenagers saw a car* a light blue station**

4

In it were seated four Negro gentlemen»

5

they saw this stationwagon circle the block around the teenage

girl’s residence and also a Gulf service station.

The police officers pulled the vehicle over on a side

The Commonwealth has argued that there may be infer­

10

ences here leading to or could be inferred that the gentlemen

11

were attempting to elude the police at the time* but I do not

12

think that that is a fair inference from the record»

13

any event* they were pulled over in the parking lot, they got

out of the stationwagon and the police officers frisked them

Q

They went back inside* after finding nothing,

Does the record show why the officers discon­

tinued the search and went into the stationhouse and then went
back out and, continued the search?
A

1!

They don11 say explicitly. Your Honor, but they I

12

do say that they want through everything and found nothing»

13

And it appears as if what they did then was to go back in and

further interrogate or attempt to interrogate to disclose in­

that»

.23

in opposition, puts it in terms of one continual interrupted

24

search rather than two searches or three searches, as you dog

25

and that is a matter .of how you view the facts, I suppose»
10

I2

A

The matter of continuity is a little hard to

2

explain, Your Honor, because of the passage of time that must be

3

inferred from the testimony of the officers as to how the searcq

4

went on»

5

Q

Does the record suggest that this was the only

6

matter that the officers were then engaged in, or did they have

7

other things to do?

8
8
10

A

It appears as if this was the only thing they

were engaged in, Mr* Chief Justice»
Later that same morning, then,, the chief of police of

t

ii

the community obtained a search warrant and went to the homes

12

of the four defendants and made a search»

In the homes of the

j

13

three other defendants, nothing was found» . He went to peti- -

j

'14

tloner’s residence and there found a holster, some dum-dum

15

bullets that were matched to one of the revolvers found in the
„
search, of the car»

16
17

At the trial, petitioner *s counsel objected to the

l

*

18

introduction of these dum-dum bullets into evidence, on the

19

grounds of relevance, at first»

20

police officer testified on the stand that the dum-dum bullets

21

matched one of the «• matched the bullets taken from one of the i
i

This was overruled»

Then the

t

22
23

weapons, and that the effect of the dum-dum bullet on a human
*
body is to make larger holes and can cause more tissue damage»

24

Petitioner 9s counsel again objected»

25

the grounds that the search warrant did not disclose or did not
11

#

This time he objected on

1

1

indicate what they were searching for,, and it did not specific­

£>

ally

3

search warrant is not available to us now.

4

It is not a matter of this record*

5

before the state habeas corpus hearings, and so we are unable

6

to say at the present: time exactly what the search warrant did

7

disclose except for the testimony of the police officer when

S

he was on the stand, who said that the search warrant did not

9

indicate that they were looking for bullets*

say what- they were searching for»

Unfortiinately9 this
It has been lost»

It apparently was lost

In any event* petitioner’s then counsel’s objection

10

11

to this evidence was overruled by the court9 who said that his

12

failure to file pretrial motions meant that the suppression

13

evidence should have been heard earlier; not having been heard*
l

■

14
15

it was overruled on those procedural grounds.,
The jury returned verdicts convicting the four de«
ty

*

16

fendants of the crimes on May 20* and petitioner was sentenced

17

to six to fifteen years imprisonmenta

ie

About two years after his conviction*, he filed a pe­

io

tition for a writ of habeas corpus in the state court»

£0

evideneiary hearing was held*, and I summarized for you what was

21

disclosed at that time that he met his counsel on the way to

An

\2

the courtroom for the trial*

There is no extensive discussion

23

as to what preparation*, if any* there was»

24

exploration as to what defenses were available* merely those

25

statements„

There is no

12
i

1

Q

Do you point to anything in the record that

2

would show that there was

3

was any dereliction of duty or failure to do some things that

4

should have been done by the lawyer?

5

A

ineffective assistance, where there

Mr» Chief Justice, if 1 can. I think the basic

6

proposition would start with the things disclosed by the record.

7

and they would be that, in the first instance, the trial court

8

overruling the objection to the dum-dum bullets on the grounds

0

that there had not been a pretrial motion filed*

The failure

10

of counsel to recognize the very valid argument in connection

It

with the search of the automobile, which we submit to the

12

Court at this time, the fact that there is no evidence at all

13

14
IS
16
17

that any pretrial consultation between the lawyer and his
colleagues or, as a matter of fact, the petitioner*
Q

What does it show about the conduct of the

first lawyer and the relations with the client?
A

It doesn*t disclose anything except in this

18

record, that I now have before the Court, it shows there that

10

there were other objections made that were not made, at the

20

second trial, for other reasons *

21

known to the lawyer at the second trial*

22

0

They were apparently not

Were they objections which were successfully

23

made the first time?

24

A

Yes *

25

Q

And you think they are material?
13

!

1

A

I believe they are material»

In connection with

2

their argument, we submit that the late appointment of counsel

3

for petitioner in this case was so prejudicial to him as to

4

warrant reversal»

5

that the right to counsel., one charged with, a serious crime has

§

a fundamental right essential to a fair trial®

7

This Court 9 in Gideon vs» Wainwright* held

The Court reaffirmed the principles of Powell vs®

8

Alabamaj where the Court said that this right was not a hollowed

9

one9 that it meant appointment at such time and under such cir­

10

cumstances as to give effective aid of counsel in the prepara­

11

tion and trial of the case»

12
13

Q

As I understand the Third Circuity they apply

the same rule as the Fourth Circuit

14
15

A

No, Your Honor», I believe initially we argue in

16

the alternative^ but I believe that it is not necessary in

17

Powell vs<, Alabama, in Gideon ^a-nd in other cases decided by

18

this Courtj to show specific prejudice, that it is not necessary

19

where you have the issue of the right to counsel to show

20

specific prejudice»

21

Q

1 have some problem of second-guessing by a

22

lawyer, because so far as 1 am concerned, and I went back over

23

records of. cases I have tried,

24

my procedureo

.

25

A

I found considerable fault with

Yes@ your Honor. I believe that that

14

1

2

Q

Thai is the problem I see here, the second**

A

Well, what we are really concerned with here,

guessing»

3
4

though. Your Honor, is not so* much second-guessing in the

5

techniques of trial, but we are talking about those factors

6

that are extrinsic to the trial itself, in other words appoint*» j

7

rn.cn.fc at such a time that he could prepare, he could do those

8

things that would lead to effective assistance of counsel<,

S

Q

He was appointed all the way back, wasn't he?

10

A

1 don't believe we can say that, Your Honor *

11

Q

Well, isn't it the normal procedure to appoint

!2

a lawyer or legal aid for all purposes of being there by order

13

of the court until he is removed?
A

14
15

It is not necessarily the same lawyer„

As a

matter of fact, it is not necessarily

16

Q

I didn't say the same lawyer, only to appoint

17

the Legal Aid group, isn't that the way it is done in the

18

court?

10

A

Generally speaking, yes, I believe it is„

.20

And then he assigns it to one of his other

21

lawyers 3

I believe he

We submit that under Powell vs. Alabama that the

12

components of the effective assistance of counsel should have

13

been providedy and those would be the opportunities to prepare*

14

the opportunities to develop the defense9 to interview wit-

IS

nesses9 to file pretrial motions»

None of these things could

16

have been done by petitioner here.

We can say that the Legal

17

Aid Society has been appointed*, but what we have to speak in

18

terms of is the effectiveness of the personal counsel that was

19

furnished to him.

20

Q

What about pretrial motions for the first trial?

21

A

There were none filed»

22

Q

There was plenty of opportunity?

23

A

There would have been plenty of time for it»

AFTERNOON SESSION

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you want to keep the

remaining time for rebuttal or do you want to continue?

5

MR. GROGANI would like to continue8 please»

6

Before the luncheon recess, Mr0 Justice Marshall

7

asked me a question in connection with when petitioner first

8

met his counsel*

9

mony at the state habeas corpus hearing indicates that he

I find in the appendix* page 236., the testi*--

10

first met his counsel on the morning of trial*

1!

quite clear*

ia

j

It states It

In my remaining time* I would like to point out to

13

the Court that our argument in connection with the rule of the

14

Third Circuit as adopted in this case is erroneous that for
.

15

the reason that we do not believe that you must show specific

16

prejudice In order to warrant reversal*

17

this Court is considering in connection with recidivist pro»»

18

ceedings in connection with the pretrial procedures*

19

any event* if you assume the validity of the rule adopted by

20

the Third Circuit in this case* which shifts the burden to the

21

prosecuting authorities to show that there was not a prejudice

22

from the appointment of counselg that this rule doesn't follow

23

the teachings of this Court as indicated in the case of

24

Chapman* because in Chapman this Court said before you can dev­

25

elare a constitutional error to be harmless* the court must
18

We point to the case

But* in

i
\

1

express a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,.,

2

And this rule s as adopted by the Third Circuit * talks in terms'

3

of overcoming this prima facie case of the ineffectiveness of

4

counsel solely by adequate affirmative proof* and we submit

3

that adequate affirmative proof in this case is not the same

S

thing as proof beyond a reasonable doubt8 as in this case we

'7

have nothing but the trial record before usg and all that that

8

trial record discloses is what was done or what may have been

9
10

n

what counsel may have been able to do within the confines
of the record as stated0
There is nothing here to indicat what could have

\%

been done that was not dones what counsel may have had to con-

13

sider and yet did not take any action upon«

14

our brief tnat there are instances where even if you assume

IS

the validity of the rule and ignored the dictates of Chapman,,

IS

that there is specific prejudice indicated», indicated by the

17

failure of counsels, for example5 for forcibly argue for

18

severance of the indictments of the two counts in connection

L9

with the two separate robberies„

We pointed out in
!

2:0
21

There is no common scheme0

The only thing in common about them was the fact
.

that the fruits of the robberies were found at the same time*,

2?.

There are other things to consider0

23

Circuit went beyond the rule of the Fourth Circuit and inquired

2i

into the adequacy of counsel solely by reference to the record

25

of the ferialo

In this cassf/ the Third

Nothing was done here to develop what counsel
19

!

1

could have done through his own testimony*

?,

any other case we. could find, counsel did not testify*

3

was not called to testify either in the habeas corpus hearing

4

or in the habeas corpus hearings in the Federal District Court*

This case* unlike
Counsel

The Legal Aid Society records were never introduced*

The petitioner was never examined in detail as to what defenses

7

he may have had»

9

The testimony of the petitioner * at the place

1C

There is no explanation of the failure of the counsel, for ex*

1!

ample, to file the pretrial motions as indicated by the record,..

12

These things should be determined and can only be done so by

'13

following the dictates of Townsend vs« Sain and having a pre«>

U

liminary hearing*
v

Turning to the search and seizure problem, we have

15
16

argued in the brief that there was not probable cause for

87

arrest, and I believe that argument is set forth adequately in

18

the brief*

19

call the Court °s attention to what the Third Circuit did in

20

this case in connection with the application of the doctrine

21

of Preston vs* United States*

22

I would like, however* in the remaining time to

Q

If we accept your view on the necessity for a

23

hearing, that that was the error in this case, you don*t reach

24

any of these other questionst do you?

25

A

That * s correct, Your Honor*
20

1

In Preston? this Court decided that where a person

2

is lawfully arrested9 a warrantless search can be made for

3

two purposes;

4

escaping or from injuring the apprehending officere and also

5

to prevent destruction of any evidence»

e
*?n

■

to find weapons to prevent the person from

The Third Circuit- in its case of United States vs.,

/

Dento^ placed two additional distinguishing features into

8

that test and said that you can nevertheless valid 3.10

less search where the search was substantially contemporaneous

cl \\?cX V X* 3. n t,

and there was a reasonable nexus between the offense and the

Miss Los?

ARGUMENT OF CAROL MARY LOS
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

2,3

MISS LOS:

24

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will readily agree

Mro Chief Justice,, may it please the Court:

that certainly no man should be asked to stand trial on serious
24

1

criminal charges or on any charges unless he has had adequate

E

opportunity to discuss his case with counsel*

3

counsel shouldn’t be forced to represent a man with only a few

4

moments notice*

5

attorney-client relationship* because not only does it lend

6

itself to the fact that the attorney might not be adequately-

7

prepared but also he may lack the inclination to act on behalf

8

of his client.

Chambers*

And certainly

This we feel destroys any semblance of the

Fortunately* that did not happen to Frank

As the record shows* we know that he was visited dur~ j

11

ing the five-month period that he was lodged in the county jail :

12

by an investigator from the Legal Aid Society* that the inves­

13

tigator did prepare a report that was reduced to writing and

14

x^as placed in the file* that the file was subsequently turned

IS

over to Mr* Tamburo, who 'was to represent Chambers on the day

16

of trial.

Is that all in the record?

of the petitioner on these lines and did not present any af­

firmative evidence to show that the petitioner had had an

opportunity to discuss this case with Mr, Tamburo*

In any event9 I think we can tell from the record

7

that Hr* Tamburo was very much aware of the facts of the mis­

trial that had occurred three weeks prior9 and was certainly

very much aware of the evidence that had been admitted at the

Now, he says that he was

10

actually prejudiced by the failure to file these post«trial

motions, these pretrial motions and, as I suggested to you, he

iz

was not prejudiced because in fact the trial judge as well as

3

the federal district court judge and the circuit court judge

14

discussed the admission of the evidence right on the merits,

5

that he could not have possibly been prejudiced by that,,

5

says he is prejudiced because he did not receive a severance

17

from the other defendants, and he cites the fact that Raymond

S

He

Lawson had previously been tried on a murder charge„

19

20
