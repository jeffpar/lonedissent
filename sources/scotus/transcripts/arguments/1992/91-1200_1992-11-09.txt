ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK S. YURICK

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. YURICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

The issue presented by this case is whether the

13

Respondents and other commercial speakers have a First

14

Amendment right to place newsrack-type dispensing devices

15

upon the public sidewalks of the City of Cincinnati.

16

The critical inquiry here is the interpretation

17

of the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test, which

18

requires a governmental regulation that burdens commercial

19

speech to burden no more speech than is necessary to

20

further the Government's substantial governmental

21 .

interest.

22

It does not require a least restrictive means

23

test, nor does the test require the regulation to

24

completely accomplish the goal.

25

regulation is permitted to be underinclusive.

In other words, the

1

The fourth prong does require a balancing test.

2

However, the Sixth Circuit in the city's opinion balanced

3

the wrong things.

4

First Amendment right was implicated, that was to be

5

balanced, the First Amendment, against the degree to which

6

the interest was served.

7

The Sixth Circuit held that since a

The correct balancing test, according to the

8

city, is the State interest taken as a whole versus the

9

incidental burden on speech.

Like the billboards in the

10

Metromedia case, newsracks are large, immobile, and semi­

11

permanent structures, although they do have a

12

communicative function.

13

By prohibiting Respondent's newsrack dispensing

14

devices, Cincinnati has done no more than attempt to

15

eliminate the problems posed by the noncommunicative

16

presence of the newsracks.

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Yurick, you suggest an

18

analogy to the Metromedia case, but isn't the city's

19

position here perhaps stronger, because Metromedia was a

20

regulation of billboards on private property?

21 -

newspapers or the distributors are simply taking over

22

public property, are they not?

23

MR. YURICK:

Here, the

I think that since public property

24

is involved the city's interest in preserving that public

25

property for all of the citizens of Cincinnati is perhaps

stronger, and I believe that in the Metromedia case the

2

prohibition was on offsite advertising, both public and

3

private.

4

I believe that the exception in Metromedia was

5

for onsite advertising.

commercial establishment could have a billboard on his own

7

property advertising whatever goods were for sale there.

Mr. Chief Justice, I would agree

18

with you there, and I think that the point is -- well,

19

it's a very good point.

20

(Laughter.)

21 .

QUESTION:

Mr. Yurick, the city here is trying

22

to draw a distinction, or does draw a distinction, between

23

ordinary newspapers and the papers that were desired to be

24

put out on the street by these Respondents, and yet I

25

suppose ordinary newspapers contain a lot of

advertisements as well, don't they?

2

MR. YURICK:

3

QUESTION:

Now, we take this case on some kind

4

of concession that this is commercial speech at issue and

5

that ordinary newspapers are not.

6

MR. YURICK:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that the

7

parties agreed that the speech in question, the

8

Respondent's publications, do constitute commercial

9

speech.

10

7

Yes, Your Honor.

There was testimony, in fact, at the hearing at

11

the district court level that they were purely

12

advertising, with the exception of Harmon Homes

13

occasionally including an article about interest rates or

14

something of that nature that might conceivably be

15

considered noncommercial speech, but the district court

16

made a finding there that the speech that was in - - even

17

the speech that was in Harmon Homes' publication was not

18

inextricably intertwined with the commercial speech.

19

QUESTION:

But in point of fact, you're not

20

making a commercial -- or your ordinance doesn't make a

21 _

commercial-noncommercial speech distinction, does it?

22

That's not what it turns on.

23

MR. YURICK:

Your Honor, my witness said that

24

the same problems are posed by boxes that contain

25

commercial speech and boxes that contain noncommercial

QUESTION:

2

3

Well, that may be, but that is not

the way you have drafted your ordinance.

4

MR. YURICK:

5

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.
Well, your - - as I understand it,

6

your ordinance turns on the predominant dedication of the

7

so-called newspapers to the dissemination of what, news of

8

current events, I guess is the way it's described, isn't

9

it, and yet everything which is excluded by that is not

10

necessarily commercial speech, isn't that true?
MR. YURICK:

11

I'm sorry, I think the distinctions

12

made by the ordinances themselves are merely commercial

13

versus noncommercial, and I think that the language used

14

in the ordinances, which distinguish between commercial

15

and noncommercial, use language that's been approved by

16

the court.

17

There was a memorandum - QUESTION:

In any case, you take the position

18

that the definition of what we are for shorthand purposes

19

calling newspapers is in fact a definition which divides

20

the world into two categories, newspapers and

21

noncommercial speech, is that correct?

22

MR. YURICK:

I think that there are newspapers

23

which are specifically allowed to be distributed from

24

newsracks on the public streets of Cincinnati.

25

that there are possibly other noncommercial types of

speech, although I'm not aware of any that have applied to

3

the city for a newsrack permit.

4

QUESTION:

But you are taking the - - if I

5

understand you, you are taking the position that if it

6

does not qualify as a newspaper, and hence does not

7

qualify for the right to be displayed and sold from these

boxes, it is -- the publication is noncommercial speech

9

within the meaning of our cases, is that correct?

10

the way you are reading your ordinance?

11

MR. YURICK:

I'm not sure that it is.

12

that there are possibly some mixed commercial and

13

noncommercial publications that don't qualify as

14

newspapers, although I'm not aware of any.

15

there may be publications like that.

that to the -QUESTION:

I think, though,

And there would be some nonmixed

18

publications which are not newspapers but which are just

19

as clearly not commercial speech, too.

20

MR. YURICK:

That's correct, and I think that

21 .

the ordinance also allows for the distribution in the

22

public way of noncommercial handbills as defined in the

code.

However, Your Honor, I believe that Your Honor

QUESTION:

I just asked you a factual question,

4

whether, under the ordinance, as I understand it, your

5

opponent's publications could not be either distributed

6

through the stationary boxes or by having people hand them

7

out to passers-by.
MR. YURICK:

8

9

That's correct, Your Honor.

However, I would point out that there is no indication in

10

the record that either of the Respondents want to do that,

11

and there's -- there are also various alternative means

12

for the Respondents to communicate their commercial

13

message.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Yurick, I understand that the

15

real estate brochure involved here sometimes contained

16

matter other than the mere listing of homes.

17

might comment on whether the market is soft or hard or

18

what interest rates are, things of that sort.

MR. YURICK:

MR. YURICK:

That's correct.
Why -- but that isn't enough to make

I think that under this -How many ads do you have to have to

be not a newspaper anymore?

makes any sort of percentage, or has any sort of

2

percentage requirement, and I'm not certain that there

3

is -- there should be any percentage requirement, because

4

to the extent that even a small proportion of

5

noncommercial speech is inextricably intertwined with

6

commercial speech, that would render the enter publication

7

noncommercial and the City of Cincinnati would permit that

8

publication to occupy sidewalk space.

9

However, in this case, as I said, the district

10

court made a finding, and it was not contested, that these

11

articles that were in the Harmon Homes publication were

12

not inextricably intertwined with the commercial message.

QUESTION:

I don't under -- they were not

inextricably intertwined.

That's correct, Your Honor.
As opposed to the advertising in

newspapers, which is inextricably intertwined?
MR. YURICK:

Your Honor, the district court

20

didn't make a finding on that and it wasn't really an

21

issue in this case because neither of the Respondents

22

claimed that they published newspapers.

But this real estate brochure was not

And you support -- and the city

supports that finding, correct?

considered underinclusive on that point.

2

I don't think that the distinction is

3

nonsensical merely because the City of Cincinnati is only

4

trying to address a very limited portion of its safety and

aesthetic problem.

forced to address or incidentally burden even a larger

group of speech.

QUESTION:

Well, assuming that to be true, isn't

your real problem here as you're describing it not that

the audience is perhaps underinclusive but that the

11

ordinance is inarticulate, and we have no way of knowing

12

what the city might decide to do next either in drawing

13

the kind of distinction that Justice -- or applying the

14

kind of distinction that Justice Scalia was discussing to

15

what we would call regular newspapers, or in deciding what

the percentage mix between advertising and news ought to

be.

In point of fact, the city is left under the

MR. YURICK:

QUESTION:

9

say anything about - -

12

Well, first, how about just the text?

Help me out on the text.
MR. YURICK:

11

There was a memorandum sent from

the city manager, who is the chief executive officer --

8

10

Is that the scheme?

QUESTION:

The text of the ordinance doesn't

It says nothing whatsoever.

So the

language that I was thinking of was in this memorandum.
MR. YURICK:

It was in a memorandum from the

13

city manager, who is the chief executive officer of the

14

city, to the city engineer.

15

And what that memo stated, paraphrasing, is that

16

from this point forward, in terms of applying

17

regulation -- administrative regulation number 38, which

18

is an administrative --an internal administrative

19

direction from the city manager to the departments about

20

how to apply the ordinances and how to interpret them,

21

that in interpreting the term, or in interpreting the

22

term, newspapers of general regulation, for purposes just

23

of allowing a box on the sidewalk, which is what

24

administrative regulation 38 deals with, that newspaper of

25

general circulation should be interpreted as relating to

publications which predominantly cover current events or

2

political affairs, things of that nature.
QUESTION:

3

Did he later testify that, roughly

4

speaking, he would suppose that predominantly applied --

5

predominantly implied that there would be something better

6

than 50 percent of the space devoted to the current

7

events?
MR. YURICK:

10

I think what the city engineer, Tom

Young, testified to was that that would present a very
close case.

1

MR. YURICK:

I think the testimony related to,

2

again, Respondent's particular publications which were

3

admittedly not newspapers.

4

QUESTION:

Okay, so in any case, you stand on

5

the fact that the city's construction of its ordinance

6

involves the word predominantly, and predominantly would

7

call for a publication with 50 percent news as opposed to

8

50 percent advertising, and that's the way the ordinance

9

is going to be interpreted and applied, is that the

10

position that you rest on?

11

MR. YURICK:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.
Aren't there other ordinances that

13

expressly permit the distribution of newspapers on a

14

public right-of-way?

15

MR. YURICK:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. YURICK:

Yes, there are.

I'm sorry --

911-17 and 862-1.
Yes, Your Honor, newspapers of

18

general circulation are expressly permitted, and again, I

19

guess I would have to say whether they --

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Do they have definitions of what is a

newspaper of general circulation?
MR. YURICK:

No.

No, and again I would have to

23

say that the 50-50 distinction was said by the city

24

engineer to present a closed case.

25

suggest that if a particular newspaper only had 30 percent

noncommercial speech in it and 70 percent commercial
speech that they would not be permitted to occupy space on
the city sidewalks.
QUESTION:

Do you measure this by words or by

area, the 30 percent/50 percent?
MR. YURICK:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I think that

Your Honor's question points out that perhaps there should
be no exact percentage.
QUESTION:
MR. YURICK:

Yes.
A newspaper I think is not such a

vague term that it can't be understood, or that the use of
the word newspaper of general circulation in the statutory
scheme can't be understood by a reasonable person.
As a matter of fact, at the hearing in the case
at the district court, the Respondents were both asked,
did the publications constitute newspapers, and they were
both able to answer the question rather quickly.

that the legislature has a greater degree of latitude in

that it's not necessarily that that ought to be the

Does the city's latitude that you

No, Your Honor, and again, in this

is exactly what is being banned.

important and valuable information concerning economic and

On the

14

According to the city's own scheme of regulating

QUESTION:

Yes or no.

MR. MEZIBOV:

3

Shortly after our publications were directed to

Yes.

4

be removed from the public right-of-way the city manager

5

passed a regulation which attempted to put some definition

6

into the city scheme.

7

That letter regulation defined as noncommercial

8

that which is a daily or weekly publication primarily

9

presenting coverage of or commentary on current events,

10

and as we know from the record below, the city engineer is

11

unable and remains unable to give a clear definition of

12

what constitutes a noncommercial publication,

13

notwithstanding the city manager's letter.

14

While the city's inability to establish clear

15

standards with regard to a distinction between

16

noncommercial and commercial speech is not necessary in

17

resolving this matter, the facial infirmities of the

18

scheme are such that it warrants further consideration

19

insofar as it points out the difficulties in dealing with

20

speech and with the possibilities of favoritism and bias

21

when a city is unable to define with any certainty what

22

constitutes commercial and what constitutes noncommercial.

23

In this situation, that threat is not merely

24

potential or hypothetical.

25

demonstrates that the threat is palpable.

We believe the record

In this case, the record reveals that the City

1

2

of Cincinnati works on an ongoing basis with certain

3

publishers, namely the city's daily newspapers, in coming

4

up with regulations governing newsracks.

5

significant, because it indicates that there is a threat

6

of favoritism or bias on the part of a city in dealing

7

with different speakers, when the speakers are essentially

8

publishing the same types of materials.

9

QUESTION:

That's

Do you think the city could

10

distinguish between newspapers of general circulation, or

11

whatever you want to call it, on the one hand, and

12

commercial handbills on the other as to distribution if it

13

precisely defined each category so that the city manager

14

would not be chargeable with any unbridled discretion?
MR. MEZIBOV:

15

It may be possible to draw such a

16

distinction, but there would be no need for a distinction

17

insofar as newsracks are concerned.

18

here is newsracks, then it ought to be newsracks which it

19

regulates.

regulate newsracks based on the content of the

publications contained in it.

MR. MEZIBOV:

There certainly would be no reason

to, based on the ostensible reasons for the city's passing

the codes.

QUESTION:

Well, supposing it passed an

ordinance that did that, do you think it should be upheld?

7

MR. MEZIBOV:

No, it may not be attacked

8

necessarily on facial grounds, but it certainly would be

9

on an applied basis if, as in this instance, the city's

10

reasons, which ostensibly are safety and aesthetics, have

11

nothing to do with the content of the publications.

QUESTION:

Well, suppose the ordinance forbade

permitted only those that are coin-operated.

MR. MEZIBOV:

1

I think under those circumstances

2

it may be possible for the city to do that, so long as the

3

reason for that ordinance is not based on the notion that

4

to be commercial or noncommercial is determined by whether

5

or not you charge a fee, and so long as the amount of

6

money that's required to operate that machine is not of

7

such an amount that it would place a burden on one speaker

or another.

2

QUESTION:

3

Couldn't you distribute them by

adding them as inserts to the newspapers?

4

MR. MEZIBOV:

If our publishers were to buy

5

space in the city newspapers, that potentially could

6

happen, but that would change our entire means of

7

operation, and also, of course, there's never any

8

guarantee that newspapers will accept advertising from all

9

advertisers.
So it may well be that if we are banned from

10
11

newsracks and banned from distributing by hand or

12

otherwise in public areas, we may be totally banned from

13

distributing our publications throughout the city by any

14

means.

QUESTION:

What if the city were to provide in

16

an ordinance that the only way you can put a newsrack - -

QUESTION:

6

The right to just take over public

MR. MEZIBOV:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe

7

that if a city has a scheme of regulation by which

8

publishers are licensed to use space in accordance with

9

terms established by the city that they are appropriating

10
11

public property for private purposes.
QUESTION:

But supposing the city just repeals

12

all its present ordinances and says, you know, they've got

13

us into a lot of litigation, one case went all the way to

14

the Supreme Court, we're just going to have a flat

15

regulation that first-come, first-served, anybody who

16

wants to put a newsrack on public property can do so, so

17

long as they pay the fair value of the lease for the

18

period of time they're occupying it.

19

MR. MEZIBOV:

Depending on the amount of money

20

needed to get that leasehold, Your Honor, I suppose the

21

city might be able to do that, so long as that scheme is

22

not contrary to public forum considerations.

property indefinitely?

2

MR. MEZIBOV:

Public forum doctrine speaks to a

3

tradition in this country, which is that people expect to

4

see and be seen and hear and be heard on public streets.

5

Newsracks meet the expectations and needs of

6

citizens.

They're found in virtually every city.

7

found on many street corners.

8

expect to find them there.

They're

That's because people

People use them.

9

The use of newsracks I don't believe, Mr. Chief

10

Justice, is contrary to the purposes of cities regulating

11

streets.

12

It seems to be a consistent application.
QUESTION:

Well, very likely because the cities

13

know that people want to buy, have newsracks available,

14

but I don't think that answers the question of whether the

15

cities might charge the fair value of a year-to-year lease

16

for that small bit of property.

17

MR. MEZIBOV:

Again, I think perhaps that

18

problem may be addressed by whether or not the amount of

19

money charged is placing too large a burden on speech.

20

If the amount of money would not be such as to

21

prohibit or prevent all speakers from using that

22

leasehold, then perhaps in those circumstances that might

23

be a constitutional ordinance.

MR. MEZIBOV:

No, we would not.

off the city streets entirely, by any means.

3

I should also point out that in this situation

4

there were 62 newsracks utilized by Harmon and Discovery's

5

publishers, whereas 2,000 newsracks approximately would be

6

permitted to remain on the city streets, according to the

7

city's- enforcement of this regulatory scheme.
In effect, as the lower courts have found, this

8

9

scheme is an ineffective means of regulation.

It never

10

directly advances any legitimate governmental interest,

11

because when our 62 are removed, we can anticipate that

12

they will be replaced by 62 supposed noncommercial

13

speakers, the daily newspapers.

QUESTION:

Did you dispute in the courts below

that your publication was commercial speech?

We disputed it in the district

We did not appeal the district court's

The reason --

So that issue in this case is just

You didn't carry it up to the court of appeals.
MR. MEZIBOV:

No, we did not.

We feel that this

case can be properly decided on Central Hudson bases, that

both the district court and the court of appeals properly

MR. MEZIBOV:

There are two publications here,

QUESTION:

Discovery's publication has

So I suppose at least the first

publication you describe really fits the definition of
commercial speech.
MR. MEZIBOV:

To the extent the definition of

12

commercial speech means proposes a commercial transaction,

13

then indeed it does.

14

QUESTION:

While you acknowledge that you do not

15

have presented before us whether you are commercial

16

speech, you also claim, however, that you are free to

17

argue here that newspapers are as much commercial speech

18

as you are.

19

MR. MEZIBOV:

That's correct.

That's one of the

20

problems with this scheme, is that it is devoid of any

21

meaningful standards.

22

Finally, the city has argued that the

23

regulations in this case are content-neutral.

24

contention is unsupported by the record.

2

publications with commercial speech has been banned from

newsracks.

4

QUESTION:

Second, only

Well, isn't your strongest argument

5

on the lack of content neutrality that when you make a

6

distinction between commercial and noncommercial which is

7

not for the purposes for which the commercial speech

8

regulation has been accepted by this Court, that that is

9

by definition a content-based distinction?

10

I mean, you

don't have to go any further than that, do you?
MR. MEZIBOV:

11

That's correct, Justice Souter.

12

The city by invoking this ordinance has made a content -

13

based - -

QUESTION:

Whereas if the city were regulating

fraud in commercial speech, it would not be invalid simply

Yes.
That's correct.

May I ask one last question?

1

Is there something in the record that

defines the scope of the authority of a city manager?
