CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Tigar.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. TIGAR

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

9

MR. TIGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice of the United

States, and may it please the Court:

10

Gary Graham was 17 years old and the product of

11

a profoundly troubled family background when he struggled

12

with, shot, and killed Bobby Grant Lambert in the

13

supermarket parking lot.

14

His case, and the issues presented today, must

15

be resolved, we suggest, by reference to precedent,

16

experience, and tradition.

17

Precedent, in the guise of Locket and Eddings,

18

yes, and Stanford v. Kentucky, in which the Court has

19

repeated over and over again the powerful mitigating force

20

of youth, and yes, precedent in the sense of Penry v.

21

Lynaugh, because this case, we submit, is stronger for us

22

than Penry's was for him because of the role of youth in

23

this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence and because of

24

the presence here, as in Eddings, of the potentiating

25

force of the family background coupled with the evidence

1

of youth.

2

And it is weaker for the respondent than their

3

position was in Penry, not simply because Penry has in the

4

interim been decided, not simply because the prosecutor

5

here, as in Penry, sought to make the second Texas special

6

issue into a double-edged sword by arguing that the

7

condition in fact made the defendant more dangerous, but

8

also because in this case the trial judge told the jury

9

over and over again in voir dire, or voir dire, whatever

10

one prefers,

11

language in ways that cabined, confined, and constricted

12

those special issues, cabined and confined them so there

13

was no chance that the promise of Jurek could be redeemed.

14

that they were to consider the special issue

Jurek was premised on a promise.

The Court said

15

that it appeared the State -- that the jury could consider

16

certain things and the Court said that right after a

17

paragraph in which it enumerated age as among the things

18

it thought of constitutional significance.

19

promise that has not been redeemed.

20

That's the

That is why Judge Higginbotham in the court

21

below said that this case is governed by precedent, so I

22

turn to the issues that the jury had before it, those

23

special issues 1 and 2, because those are the significant

24

ones.

25

Special issue number 1 has to do with

1

deliberateness, and yet the trial judge told the jury that

2

that meant nothing more than intentionality.

3

say, the same element of the offense of which Gary Graham

4

then stood convicted, because that's the element under

5

6.02(a) of the Texas Penal Code that is a part of first

6

degree murder.

7

That is to

Special issue 2, future dangerousness -- here,

8

as in Penry, both double-edged and under-inclusive.

9

double-edged because Gary Graham is 17.

He has a longer

10

time before he got old enough to outgrow the kinds of

11

behavior the trial judge said satisfied future

12

dangerousness:

13

pouring paint on a car -- those sorts of relatively

14

trivial offenses.

15

It's

doing wheelies with your Harley on a lawn,

Double-edged because there is in this court's

16

cases a deep and, we say, rationally-based social

17

consensus that youth is mitigating in and of itself.

18

is to say, that it's mitigating beyond what it may have in

19

terms of predictive ability.

20

That

The prosecutor emphasized the double-edged point

21

by saying as the seed is planted so grows the sprout, as

22

the twig is bent, so grows the tree.

23

QUESTION:

If we accept that, do we have to

24

overrule Jurek, because Jurek was premised on the fact

25

that the moral significance could theoretically at least

1

be considered within the framework of the questions, and

2

I'm not sure that the youth consideration could meet the

3

test, as you describe it, unless we overrule Jurek?

4

MR. TIGAR:

No, Justice Souter, we do not ask

5

you to overrule Jurek, any more than the State asks you to

6

overrule Penry.

7

No.

Penry said there would have to be an additional

8

instruction beyond the special issue, and all Jurek says

9

is that the jury may be asked to consider whatever

10
11

evidence of mitigating circumstances.
Jurek didn't say that it had to be within the

12

special issues, and the problem, Justice Souter, is

13

created by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which in

14

Black v. State says, we will not retreat a millimeter back

15

from the language of the special issues.

We won't

16

authorize giving any extra instructions.

It's futile to

17

ask for them.

18

So no, we don't think that Jurek should be

19

overruled, and in fact the Court's opinion in Franklin

20

stands as a testament that under certain circumstances,

21

perhaps many, Jurek and what this Court said in Jurek,

22

what it said in later cases, can live quite happily

23

together without questioning Jurek.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, it seems, Mr. Tigar, that in

almost any case there's going to be some evidence of

sure where the limits of your rule are.

QUESTION:

MR. TIGAR:

I have the same

Justice Kennedy -And probably both.
At the margin, there are surely

cases in which these issues are raised -- for example, in

10

Boyd v. California or Franklin itself.

a 17-year-old whose mother was in and out of mental

12

hospitals 20 or 30 times.

13

This is a case of

So I look to Eddings, which is the closest case,

14

and see if maybe there's an opinion for the majority of

15

the Court that answers your question, and I think it does.

16

The Court there identified two things.

17

First, factors.

The Eighth Amendment mandates

18

that certain factors shall be considered as mitigating,

19

and youth is surely among them if we take Stanford.

20

troubled family background surely is among them.

21

question is, if the factor has been identified, what

22

evidence, and the Eighth Amendment also mandates that the

23

defendant be able to put on evidence.

24
25

A

Then the

Now, surely, once the State has done that job as
it has done in the three statutes that the State in this

1

case clings to as good ones -- Saffle, Blystone, and

2

Boyde -- then we say that there can be a question, the

3

threshold question, as to whether the evidence proffered

4

entitles the defendant to an instruction that as whether

5

the evidence goes to or sufficiently relates to one of the

6

constitutionally identified mitigating factors.

7

common question in all kinds of criminal cases in those

8

not involving the Eighth Amendment.

9

That's a

The Court started its opinion in Jacobson, for

10

example, by noting that if the evidence has been

11

different, Jacobson, quote, would not even have been

12

entitled to an instruction.

13

with that threshold issue ever since the 19th Century, and

14

we suggest that those standards could be applied here.

15

The Court's been wrestling

But the third way, and this is -- in which the

16

evidence is under-inclusive is precisely because of

17

Eddings, that very powerful analysis, particularly in

18

footnote 11, about the consensus that adolescents tend to

19

be dangerous, particularly in the teenage years, that

20

there's a sense that it maybe society's fault.

21

that's dispositive, or that you or I or any of us would

22

say that it is in a particular case, but that the

23

sentencer, in the words of Eddings, Locket requires the

24

sentencer to listen.

25

That comes back to the Jurek point.

Not that

Penry says

1

you need an additional instruction.

2

with Jurek, and why?

3

Griffin, which is not a capital punishment case.

4

Griffin the Court said juror intuition takes care of a lot

5

of problems about what the facts are, but we certainly do

6

not expect juror intuition to be able to deal with what

7

the law is.

8

from the failure of the Court to instruct correctly on the

9

law.

10

â– "

That's consistent

Because of what the Court said in

That won't -- their intuition can't save them

And another analogy that we draw that we think

11

is powerful is last term's decision in Morgan v. Illinois.

12

If seating one juror who says, I ain't following those

13

mitigating instructions, is an error, how much more of an

14

error is it if the judge says in effect to the jurors, you

15

can't consider the mitigating evidence, which is what was

16

said here?

17

Because when the judge had finished with his

18

constricted view of the law, the last thing he said to

19

this jury before they deliberated the fate of this 17-

20

year-old young man was, you take your law from me.

21

other judge is the facts, but you take your law from me.

22

Beyond, then, the issue of precedent, it seems

Your

to us that the Fifth Circuit has missed the Eddings point.

Interestingly, the respondent doesn't embrace the Fifth

25

Circuit's opinion we deal with in our brief.

It seems to

1

us that the Fifth Circuit has mistaken a reweighing of

2

evidence for this constitutional duty under Eddings to

3

look at the factors that are mitigating and make sure the

4

jury hears about the factors.

5

The second element, if the Court please, is

6

experience, and by experience I mean the power that this

7

Court has traditionally recognized attaches to evidence of

8

youth, and that runs through many of the cases.

9

Graham was 17 when he killed Bobby Grant Lambert.

10
11

Gary
Nathan

Leopold was 18 when he killed his victim.
And Gary Graham doesn't say he has a

12

constitutional right to Leopold's result any more than he

13

has the right to an advocate as eloquent as Leopold's

14

advocate, but he does have the right to have his sentencer

15

free to consider the power of this mitigating evidence

16

that this Court has repeatedly identified as powerful in

17

the way that this Court's decisions teach.

18

The whole life of childhood, said Leopold's

19

counsel, is a dream and an illusion, and whether they take

20

one shape or another depends not upon the dreamy boy but

21

upon what surrounds him, evidence that evokes what Justice

22

Powell said for the Court in footnote 11 in Eddings.

23

I suggest they want you to forget as justices

24

that which you know as lawyers who have tried and presided

25

over cases, that which you know as men and women, and that

that Judge Higginbotham in his dissent identified as the

2

power of this evidence based on his experience as an able

3

trial lawyer and a trial judge before he went on the court

4

of appeals.

5

And of course, beyond experience there is

6

tradition.

7

stronger for us than Penry's.

8

youth is recognized in our legal tradition for at least

9

2,200 years, and we can trace it back that far.

10

That's one reason I say that the case is
The mitigating power of

In Stanford v. Kentucky this Court called out

11

the roll call of the States.

12

sure guide to the Eighth Amendment duty of the Court is to

13

look at statutes passed by society's elected

14

representatives, and then the Court called out in this

15

roll call 29 States that expressly make youth a mitigating

16

factor -- 29.

17

It began by saying that one

And then, having done that, it's clear from

18

Stanford and from reading the statutes of the other States

19

that if they don't mention youth expressly that they all

20

have one of these catch-all clauses, catch-all mitigating

21

clauses that the Court has sustained in such cases as

22

Boyde and Blystone and Saffle that permit the lawyers to

23

argue it without being headed off at the pass by

24

prosecutorial or judicial argument.

3

brief because they formed no part of the record below and

4

we think that the Court ought not to consider them, that

5

had they -- not having been subjected to adversary

6

scrutiny, they don't belong in the case.

7

It has some

We didn't bother to answer those in our reply-

But it's interesting to note that if you move

8

the age from 23 to 24, that the alleged disparity shrinks

9

to .5 percent instead of whatever they say it is.

10

It's interesting to note that there are 82, not

11

81 youths that got the life sentence, so their arithmetic

12

is off, and it's also interesting to note that if you run

13

the elementary statistical test of the null hypothesis,

14

that the results cannot be attributed to anything more

15

significant than chance.

16
17

But as I say, I don't think that the Court needs
to reach that.

18

The question might also arise in the Court's

19

decision, well, what should we do about marginal cases?

20

What does age mean, because that's in the court of

21

appeals.

22

Our contention is this:

that age means that at

23

least the teenage years as identified in Eddings, that the

24

Fifth Circuit says 22, the State is willing to say 23, and

25

that time enough to resolve that question, because the

1

*

States are answering it.

2

This is a case of a 17-year-old, and as to 17-

3

year-olds, as to the mitigating force of youth for them,

4

after Penry, Oregon and Texas stood alone.

5

changed its practice and then its statute, and as we point

6

out in our brief, Texas then amended its statute with the

7

aid of lawyers from the Attorney General's Office.

Oregon quickly

8

Indeed, the reason for that amendment is not

9

hard to find when one reads the stunning concession at

10

page 28 of the Attorney General's brief.

11

the statutory terms at issue relate to matters that might

12

support affirmative answers to the special issues, i.e.,

13

aggravating factors that have no logical connection to the

14

inquiry as to whether a rational jury could give effect to

15

Graham's mitigating evidence.

16

That is to say,

In short, the State seems to be saying that the

17

factors are probably on their face more adapted to the

18

aggravators, and that additional instructions as required

19

in Penry might be the answer to redeeming the Jurek

20

promise, that under those circumstances, particularly when

21

you have the instructions in an as-applied way constricted

22

and confined by the trial judge's instructions and by the

23

prosecutor's argument, there's no chance that the

24

mitigating force of this evidence could have been

25

appreciated by the jury.

â– h-

1

If we are to go back, then, to that most

2

objective and reliable indicium -- that is to say, what

3

the States have done -- it is clear that this is a little

4

like Coker v. Georgia, where, as the Court noted in

5

Stanford, Georgia stood alone.

6

Here, Texas stands alone, but within its own

7

house it is divided against itself, for by its legislative

8

enactment it has recognized that the mitigating evidence

9

that could not be considered under the former statute must

10

now be given a chance to be heard by the sentencer.

QUESTION:

You raise two -- excuse me --

12

questions, I believe, and one has to do with youth and the

13

other with evidence of positive character traits.

14

MR. TIGAR:

15

QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.
Now, I suppose there isn't a

16

defendant in the world that hasn't patted a dog or kissed

17

a sibling or been kind to a grandmother at some time in

18

their life.

19

MR. TIGAR:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's true.

20

We were asking the Court to illuminate what it means by

21

the word character in the character on record and then

22

circumstances of the offense language.

23

Character evidence is -- of course, is not

24

receivable unless it passes some minimal threshold of

25

relevance.

That comes back, we believe, to the factors
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260

1

evidence.

2

Here, the positive character traits must be

3

considered -- again, Eddings I think is our best

4

case -- because these positive character traits existed

5

despite the troubled family background.

6

That is, some -- I don't think that Hitchcock

7

comes out as it does just because Mr. Hitchcock is a kind

8

uncle.

9

important because, after a lifetime of adversity, he still

I think Mr. Hitchcock's kind uncleness is

10

manages to do that, and here Mr. Graham loves the Lord,

11

cares for the children that he had, and shows these traits

12

despite what's happened to him.

13

So we say that whatever the threshold is, we

14

meet it, but also looking to such cases as Boyde, in which

15

the Court has quite frankly assessed the relevance of the

16

evidence to a factor already identified and said that

17

there might be some threshold that somebody would have to

18

meet, that that standard, or that analysis would permit

19

the Court to draw a line.

20

Our view is that wherever the line is drawn, we

21

have to disagree with the Fifth Circuit, because on this

22

record the combination of circumstances is even more

23

powerful than the Eddings combination as to which the

24

Court said you had to look at it as a whole and that the

25

sentencer there was not authorized to just focus on you.

QUESTION:

Let me ask you one question on

something you haven't touched on in the course of the
argument.

You mention in your brief that there is perhaps

a theoretical flaw, or at least a theoretical inadequacy
in placing great reliance on the second Texas question,
the prediction of future dangerousness.
Because that is basically -- by its very nature
it is a predictive inquiry, whereas the judgment which
must be expressed consistent with Eddings and Locket is a
moral judgment about the individual and the act, if we
accept the view that the second question, the predictive
question is in fact not a moral question, let's say in a
utilitarian sense or a moral inquiry in a utilitarian
sense, does it follow from your argument, if we accept it,
that there will for practical purposes always have to be a
Penry kind of catch-all question?
MR. TIGAR:

No, it does not, Justice Souter, and

I think Franklin is the answer to that.
Franklin did not contend that his evidence,
however characterized, did more than help the jury answer
no to the second question, so that there is a case in
which the Court said, it's adequate.
The concession the State makes at page 28 of its
brief, however, troubles me, as your question troubles me.
I suggest to the Court that the problem is this, that
16

1

maybe it's true, and the Court could conclude that the

2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. PALMER

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PALMER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Graham's claim that his jury could not give
mitigating effect to his constitutional evidence is both

10

factually and legally insufficient to establish an Eighth

11

Amendment violation.

12

It fails as a factual matter because many of the

13

assertions on which his legal theory is based were not

14

supported by the record, and it fails as a matter of law

15

under Jurek.

QUESTION:
Mr. Palmer?

MR. PALMER:

Yes, sure.
I think some of us may be having a

hard time hearing.

MR. PALMER:

I'm sorry.

22

One would think that if Graham's mitigating

23

evidence were as compelling as he suggests, that it would

be included in the join appendix.

mistreated in any way as a child, and there is absolutely
no showing that any event of his childhood contributed to
make him the extremely violent person he had become at the
age of 17.
In addition, Graham misconstrues the record of
the voir dire examination at his trial.

While the judge

and counsel for both the State and Graham offered varying
definitions of the word, deliberately, the trial court did
not in fact define that word for the venir members so as
to reduce the State's burden of proof.
The record shows that the trial court repeatedly
advised the venir members that the term would not be
defined at trial and they were to use their own common
sense interpretation of what the word deliberately means
in answering the first special issue.

To support that

statement, I would refer the Court to the joint appendix
at pages 90, 169, 205, 291, 353, and 419.
Finally, Graham's assertion that the trial
court's definition of the term, criminal acts of violence,
somehow reduced the State's burden of proof on the second
special issue is likewise reputed by the record.

The

examples offered by the trial court of relatively minor
offenses were included in a broad definition of that term,
which also referred to robbery, rape, and murder.

Again,

as with the term, deliberately, the trial court told the

1

venir members that criminal acts of violence would not be

2

defined at their trial, and as with the term,

3

deliberately, the jurors would use their own common sense

4

interpretation.

5

Not only is Graham's claim factually lacking, it

6

also is untenable as a matter of law under Jurek.

7

Jurek, this Court upheld the constitutionality of the

8

statute at issue here precisely because it allows the jury

9

to consider whatever evidence of mitigating circumstances

10

In

the defense can bring before it.
The Jurek court did not believe that the special

11
12

issues were so narrow as to foreclose consideration of

13

mitigating evidence, but instead found that they got in

14

focus the jury's consideration of the circumstances of the

15

individual offender and his offense.

16

Jurek controls Graham's claim.

There, as here,

17

the defendant was a young person at the time of his

18

offense.

19

Fifth Circuit have held that youth includes defendants up

20

to the age of 23 at the time of their offense.

Both the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and the

Graham acknowledges, as he must under Jurek,

21

22

that his jury could give mitigating effect to his youth in

23

answering the second special issue, but he claims that it

24

had relevance outside the scope of the Texas statutory

25

scheme.

1

As the court of appeals observed, though, to say

2

that youth cannot be considered under the special issues

3

is necessarily to say that any evidence to which a

4

defendant ascribes mitigating value cannot be considered.

QUESTION:

Are you going to get to - - did

Are you going to get to his specific argument

8

that in this case he was sufficiently young so that when,

9

for purposes of the second question, future dangerousness,

10

the jurors considered that youth, their likely response

11

would be that he is so young that even after conviction

12

he's still going to remain young, and it's going to be

13

quite some time before he outgrows the impulsiveness,

14

violence, whatever the case may be, and therefore,

15

considering youth, it really must be considered as an

16

aggravating factor rather than a mitigating one, with the

17

result, unless there is a special Penry kind of circuit-

18

breaker here, that there would be no way to consider the

19

youth as a mitigating factor?

20

What is your response to that argument?

21

MR. PALMER:

My response is, Your Honor, that

22

examination of the trial record reveals that youth was

23

offered for one purpose only, and that was to show that

24

Graham would not be a future danger.

2

after the offense, and the jury was able to observe his

apparent age at the time of trial.

4

In addition, defense counsel stated without

objection that Graham had been 17 at the time of the

6

offense.

Graham had, and I'm essentially paraphrasing his closing

argument, had redeeming value, that he could be

Perhaps most damaging to Graham, rather than

17

whatever aggravating quality might be attached to his

youth is the fact that the State proved that he was a

demonstrably violent person, as evidenced by the number of

extraneous offenses they introduced at the punishment

phase of trial.

that Jurek remains good law, yet he asks this Court to

11

interpret Penry in a manner that can't be squared with

13

interpretation of Penry is so broad that it requires that

Jurek be overruled.

It goes only to future dangerousness.

MR. PALMER:

Yes, Your Honor, but the point I'm

making is that his present culpability, his culpability

17

for the crime itself, is taken into account by the jury at

18

two different stages of the trial:

guilty of the capital murder itself, because in doing so

QUESTION:

Well, did the court of appeals

3

expressly deal with the notion of youth as a mitigating

factor in the sense of less culpability for committing the

crime that he's committed?

6

about that, other than by saying you don't need to - - you

don't need a special instruction on that?

Did the court of appeals talk

MR. PALMER:

I'm not sure they'd rest it in just

9

the terms Your Honor has posed.

What they did say, and

10

what I would argue strenuously to the Court,

11

is no showing that youth is mitigating other than the

12

purpose for which it was offered at trial, and that was in

13

regard to the future dangerousness issue, and in that

regard we'd rely on Boyde, where the Court observed that

the purpose for which it was offered.

They do, Your Honor, and again,

it

is our position that the first issue raises that.

terms of culpability.

QUESTION:

Mr. Palmer, I'm not sure I understand

how youth is considered under the first question.

6

premise to asking you about that, may I just ask you to go

7

back a moment to something that I think I recall your

saying when you were commenting on the manner in which the

Texas courts have defined deliberateness, and you said

10

11

As a

they didn't simply equate it with intention.
If I remember what you said correctly, you said

12

that they had defined deliberateness or deliberation as

13

the process which leads to the doing of an intentional

act, is that correct?

15

MR. PALMER:

16

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
All right.

Well, does it follow from

that that whenever an intentional act has been committed

between premeditation and intent, and it involves some

mental process more than simply the intent to do the act

MR. PALMER:

1

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that much

2

can be gleaned from Graham's brief in this case where he

3

lists the qualities of youth that are deemed to be

4

mitigating, and among them is impulsiveness, the inability

5

to think rationally or maturely before acting, obviously

6

deliberate is going to be the converse of impulsive, and

7

if a quality of youth is impulsiveness, then just as

8

obviously the deliberateness inquiry will encompass that.

9

As I was saying moments ago, the class is

10

narrowed at the guilt phase, then we have the punishment

11

phase at which the State bears the burden of proof beyond

12

a reasonable doubt on all of the special issues.

13

We know from Walton v. Arizona that it is

14

permissible for the defendant to prove mitigation by a

15

preponderance.

16

capital defendants much more protection in that regard by

17

requiring the State to prove the issues beyond a

18

reasonable doubt.

19

Texas affords the defendants -- its

The defendant is allowed to introduce whatever

20

evidence he wishes in mitigation, and the jury normally is

21

instructed, as it was in Graham's case at page 10 of the

22

joint appendix, that it is to consider all the evidence

23

presented.

24

jury's consideration of that evidence, but it is in fact

25

instructed to consider all of the evidence introduced at

Not only is there no instruction limiting the

2

both phases of trial.
Penry simply held, we believe, that supplemental

3

instructions were required in that case to allow the jury

4

to give effect to his mental retardation and childhood

5

abuse as mitigating factors, and that holding followed

6

from the recognition that although Penry's evidence had

7

mitigating quality, that it was essentially aggravating as

8

to the future dangerousness inquiry.

9

QUESTION:

But wasn't it also true that there

10

was some emphasis in the opinion on the lesser moral

11

culpability for a mentally retarded person?

12

MR. PALMER:

That is true, Your Honor, and I

13

suppose to that extent Penry's evidence cannot be

14

considered within the first special issue, either.

15

QUESTION:

To that extent, I guess --

16

QUESTION:

Excuse me, you suppose to that

17
18

extent, what?

I'm having trouble hearing you.

MR. PALMER:

That the jury was not able to give

19

full mitigating effect to his evidence within the first

20

special issue as well as the second.

21

QUESTION:

But to that extent isn't that case

22

somewhat similar, at least, to this case, in that at least

23

under Justice White's questioning you suggested that youth

24

may reduce the moral culpability of the defendant, but --

25

oh, you take the position it does not reduce the moral

1

culpability of the defendant.

2

not, but mental age might.

3

MR. PALMER:

The chronological age does

No, Your Honor, we will accept that

4

perhaps chronological age does, but that it has no

5

relevance outside the inquiries posed by the two special

6

issues, the first two.

7

QUESTION:

That the reduced moral culpability of

8

the defendant has no relevance.

9

MR. PALMER:

No.

No, Your Honor, we accept that

10

that's relevant and that is a consideration as far as

11

mitigating evidence goes.

12

the special issues allow consideration of that with regard

13

to whether he acted deliberately and then as to future

14

actions, through the second issue.

15
16

QUESTION:

It's simply our position that

That the special issues do allow

adequate consideration of reduced moral culpability.

on.

21

MR. PALMER:

Yes, Your Honor.
But then, why wasn't that a
That's what I'm not clear

Well, again, I would defer to what

22

the court of appeals said, and that is that Penry suffered

23

from a uniquely severe permanent handicap.

24

standard the Fifth Circuit has enunciated that a capital

25

defendant must satisfy to prevail on a Penry claim and - 35

That is, the

1

QUESTION:

I see the relevance of that when

2

you're predicting future dangerousness, but I'm not quite

3

sure I understand why that seriously distinguished the two

4

cases on moral culpability.

5
6

MR. PALMER:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I can't give

you any other answer than I have.

7

QUESTION:

Thank you.

8

QUESTION:

Suppose 10 years goes by so that a

9

17-year-old is not sentenced until he's 27 years old, does

10

future dangerousness then take into account his youth at

11

the time of the commission of the crime?

12

MR. PALMER:

13

QUESTION:

14
15
16

I would say not, Your Honor.
It was 4 years in this case until he

was sentenced.
MR. PALMER:

No, Your Honor, he was tried and

sentenced 5 months after --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. PALMER:

Oh, 5 months.
Now, again, my primary position --

19

and forgive me for articulating it so poorly, is that it's

20

the first special issue that focuses on the present

21

culpability, but the second special issue allows the jury

22

to give mitigating effect to his youth as having the

23

capacity for rehabilitation, the capacity for

24

rehabilitation being an equally valid sense and concern as

25

his personal culpability.

Graham also argues that the prosecutor argued

1

2

his youth as a basis for a sentence of death.

The record

3

does not support this assertion.

4

contained at page 480 of the joint appendix simply

5

stressed that Graham is a demonstrably violent person and

6

that his past actions were probative of his future

7

behavior.

8

suggest, that Graham deserved to die because he was young.

9

Finally, Your Honors, in closing I would like to

The argument which is

The prosecutor did not argue, even remotely

10

respond to what I would consider a rather curious

11

assertion that the act of the Texas legislature in

12

amending the statute somehow lends validity to Graham's

13

claim.

14

As an initial matter, I would note that it is

15

incorrect, as Graham asserts at footnote 11 of his reply

16

brief, that the Office of the Attorney General drafted and

17

sponsored the new statute.

18

passed is not the one that was drafted and supported by

19

our office.

20

In fact, the statute that was

That matter aside, it can hardly be doubted the

21

legislature acted prudently in responding to the Penry

22

court's concerns, and in amending the statute they

23

necessarily did so broadly enough to encompass the class

24

of Penry excludables.

25

should not be taken as a concession as to the validity of

Their action in doing so, however,

1

the 360 remaining convictions.

2

perhaps supported by the fact that there have been 21

3

executions that have taken place since Penry, all under

4

the old statute.

5

I think this assertion is

In closing, Your Honors, I would like to

6

emphasize that the scope of the decision in this case far

7

exceeds mere youth.

8

decided, we've seen a number of claims by capital

9

defendants as to what constitutes mitigating evidence, and

We are seeing -- since Penry was

10

included in those are the fact that the defendant was a

11

sociopath, a condition this Court has found very

12

aggravating in Smith v. Estelle --

13

QUESTION:

That's claimed to be mitigating, the

14

fact the person's a sociopath.

15

MR. PALMER:

Yes, Your Honor.

James

16

Demouchette, the last prisoner to be executed in Texas,

17

the execution of which took place last month, that was

18

precisely is submission -- that he was a sociopath, that

19

that explained his actions, that he could not control it,

20

and that therefore it was mitigating under the rule of

21

Penry.

22

We've also been told things such as -- by a

23

Hispanic petitioner who claimed that it was part of

24

Hispanic culture to smoke marijuana and to get into

25

fights, and that the evidence he presented of that at his

2

trial was mitigating.
We've been -- we've seen claims from defendants

3

who were brought up, they claim, to hate a particular

4

racial group, and therefore the acts of violence they

5

committed on members of that group were mitigating.

6

Again, these claims, bizarre as they may seem,

7

fit within the language of Henry in that they explain the

8

defendant's actions and they show that he is burdened with

9

a condition over which he has no control.

11

If the Court has no further questions, that
concludes my remarks.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. TIGAR

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MR. TIGAR:

We have a watershed difference here

17

about what the jury was told in this case as to special

18

issue number 1 and the intent element of the offense, and

19

something of a difference about Texas law.

20

try to resolve it.

21

I'd like to

At pages 6 and 7 of our brief, quoting from the

22

joint appendix, we have extensive quotations from the voir

23

dire as to what the jurors were told:

24

that in my mind anyway it is a person's intention to do

25

something, and other remarks to the same effect.

At joint appendix 5, we have the jury-

1

2

instructions given in the guilt phase.

3

with intent with respect to the nature of his conduct, or

4

to a result of his conduct when it is his conscious

5

objective or desire to engage in the conduct or cause the

6

result.

7

Intentionally, or

Now, all that complicated language does is read

8

out section 6.02(a) of the Texas Penal Code, which differs

9

from the model penal code quadripartite intent elements

10

only in that Texas chooses to use the word intention

11

rather than purposefulness, which is the more preferred

12

model penal code formulation, but then when it's defined,

13

it's the same thing.

14

objective or desire, so there can't be any doubt that the

15

trial judge conflated these two standards and thus took

16

care of any mitigating force that might have been in

17

special issue number 1.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

It's in terms of this conscious

Well, is the jury entitled to

consider the strength of the State's evidence on intent?
MR. TIGAR:

The standard of proof, Justice

21

Kennedy, is the same with respect to both of the elements,

22

so that there really isn't any opportunity for the jury to

23

do other than look again to the same things they looked at

24

plus, of course, to the additional aggravating evidence

25

when they get on to the punishment phase.

That's the

Now, that's a

post-Penry decision, and there's a defendant up in --

QUESTION:

Mr. Tigar, your argument that you

that, I suppose that doesn't go to the facial validity of

the Texas statute.
MR. TIGAR:

No, it doesn't Justice White.

That's
QUESTION:

10

And so you might win this case, but

11

if the trial judge had spoken differently you might lose

12

it.

MR. TIGAR:

That's correct, Justice White, and

14

we might lose -- might have lost this case if the

15

defendant were 25 years old.

16

different one than it was at the margin as opposed to

17

right in the center, then there'd be a different result.

18

That's the meaning of an as-applied challenge, and if I

19

may interrupt my Black v. State discussion, that's what we

20

think is wrong with the court of appeals.

21

I mean, if the case were a

and then gets to the result that it gets to.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tigar, your opponent says that

3

claims have been raised in Texas now since Penry that

4

being a sociopath is in effect a mitigating circumstance.

5

If you prevail here, do you think that would have to be

6

regarded as a mitigating evidence?

7

MR. TIGAR:

8

Of course not.

9

this is to be done.

Of course not, Justice Rehnquist.

I mean, this Court said in Eddings how
There are these constitutionally
