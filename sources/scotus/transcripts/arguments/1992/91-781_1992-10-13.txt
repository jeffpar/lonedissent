CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Ms. Wax, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY L. WAX

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. WAX:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case concerns the scope of the statutory

11

innocent owner defense to a forfeiture of property under

12

21 U.S.C. 881(a)(6), the statute authorizing civil in rem

13

forfeiture of proceeds of illegal drug transactions.

14

The Government's position in this case is that

15

someone like Respondent Beth Ann Goodwin who receives a

16

gift of drug profits and uses that money to purchase real

17

property cannot a defense to forfeiture that is only

18

available to innocent owners because that person does not

19

own the property.

20

Under Federal forfeiture statutes, title to

21

property vests irreversibly in the Government when the act

22

giving rise to forfeiture is committed.

23

owns the property from that point forward, and its

24

interests cuts off all rights, including ownership rights,

25

for anyone who subsequently acquires the property.

The United States

QUESTION:

1

Then the innocent owner defense is

2

available only to someone in the chain of title before the

3

forfeiture occurs?

4

MS. WAX:

Precisely, Your Honor.

Someone has to

5

have a preexisting, valid ownership interest before the

6

acts giving rise to forfeiture occur so that someone like

7

Ms. Goodwin is really in no better position, someone who

8

receives the gift of drug profits, than someone who

9

receives stolen money, a gift of stolen property.

That

10

person has no right to the property as against its true

11

owner however innocently it was acquired.
So, in this case Respondent Beth Ann Goodwin is

12

13

not the owner of the $200,000 in drug profits that she

14

received from her companion, Mr. Brenna, nor does she own

15

the residence that she purchased with that money.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask there?

What about the

17

person who sold her the residence and has the purchase

18

price?

19
20

Who owns the purchase price?
MS. WAX:

Well, Your Honor, our position -- that

is a - - really an entirely different question.
QUESTION:

21

Well, I don't know.

It's the same

22

money.

The money went to buy the house, and that's --

23

used Government money, and then the person who sold the

24

house received that money.

25

person is receiving Government property.

It would seem to me that

MS. WAX:

1

Your Honor, the answer to that

2

question lies we believe not in construction of the

3

innocent owner defense, but in what the word "proceeds"

4

means.

5

buying the house from somebody and that person receiving

6

the money, the question is does the word "proceeds" cover

7

both sides of that bilateral, full-value transaction, or

8

does it only cover one side.

9

construction of the word "proceeds" would cover just the

If there is a bilateral transaction, such as her

We think that a reasonable

10

house that she received and not necessarily the money that

11

the particular seller received.
QUESTION:

12

13

a house - -

14

MS. WAX:

15

QUESTION:

16

Well, what if the drug dealer bought

Yes.
-- then sold it, and gave the

proceeds to his companion who then bought another house?

17

MS. WAX:

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. WAX:

Okay.
Would that be a different case?
No.

In that case, when the drug

20

dealer bought the house, he got a house which, in effect,

21

was substituted for his original profits.

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. WAX:

24

concerned.

25

proceeds - -

Right.
That's proceeds as far as we're

That's derivative assets, and that is

QUESTION:

1

2

about the money that the seller of that house got?

3
4

So, the house is proceeds, and what

MS. WAX:

That --we think a fair construction

of proceeds is that that's not proceeds.

5

In light of -- in the civil statute, in light of

6

the narrow innocent owner defense, we think that the word

7

"proceeds" arguably does not cover the money that goes to

8

a seller if it's a bona fide transaction, there's no

9

collusion, it's in good faith, and there's full value.
So, Your Honor, what I'm trying to say is that

10
11

if there's help for bona fide purchasers in this statute,

12

we don't think the help lies in twisting the innocent

13

owner defense to apply to after-acquirers of property or

14

persons who acquire their interest after the offense takes

15

place.

16

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Wax, would your -- how does

17

your theory play out in terms of any mortgage that has

18

been put on the house?

19

MS. WAX:

20

QUESTION:

21

22

Right.
Does the Government take the property

subject to the mortgage or not?
MS. WAX:

Well, Your Honor, I think that if the

23

mortgage -- the answer would be, under the theory I just

24

stated, probably no in the sense that if the mortgage is a

25

true business-like mortgage by just any old bank or - 6

1

2

It's a -- it's an ordinary

lending institution that had no way of knowing --

3

MS. WAX:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes.

Right.
-- that the proceeds used to make the

down payment were those of a drug transaction.

6

MS. WAX:

Right.

Well, there are three answers

7

to that mortgagee.

8

answer to Justice Stevens is, it may well be that the lien

9

or the lien interest that mortgagee holds is not really

The first answer, as reflected in my

10

proceeds if he gave cash to the person who owned the

11

house.

12

I mean, that would seem to follow.
So, what in effect I'm saying, Justice O'Connor,

13

is that to the extent that mortgagees and lienors and

14

other true bona fide purchasers are concerned about what

15

our position is in this case, they may well be fighting

16

the battle on the wrong front.

17

QUESTION:

They're trying --

But do I take it that you submit the

18

case to us on the theory that the Government concedes that

19

a bona fide purchaser exception is read into the statute

20

insofar as the definition of proceeds is concerned?

21

MS. WAX:

We certainly think that's possible,

22

Your Honor, that that -- the issue of a comprehensive

23

theory of proceeds is not directly presented by this

24

situation because Ms. Goodwin's house is proceeds under a

25

narrow theory, under a broad theory, under any plausible

The house continues to be covered all

Yes.
The house is still covered.

Why

18

isn't the sale of that house proceeds to the person who

sells the house?

MS. WAX:

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. WAX:

Okay.
It isn't as I understand you.

Right?

Well, Your Honor, I think what's

23

confusing people is that under conventional tenets of

24

forfeiture law, once a thing becomes tainted, a res

25

becomes tainted, it's tainted forever.

Okay?

And that's

1

one of the predicates of our argument in this case.
What I'm saying is it's possible that through

2

3

the definition of the word "proceeds," what proceeds

4

means, in effect, Congress sort of negated that to the

5

extent that if there's a full-value exchange -- if the

6

Government can go after one-half of that full-value

7

exchange, in effect, the taint is purged from the other

8

half.

9

of the meaning of the word "proceeds," not a wholesale

10

11

I guess that's what I'm saying, but that's a matter

suspension of the common law conventions of forfeiture.
And the reason why it's important that there not

12

be a wholesale suspension in this case is that that

13

convention is not suspended when assets migrate from the

14

original drug dealer into the hands of a person who

15

receives it as a gift.

16

QUESTION:

Have we ever applied the relation-

17

back doctrine, relation-back forfeiture, to anything

18

except physical property --

19

MS. WAX:

20

QUESTION:

21

MS. WAX:

Well --- in contradistinction to cash?
Well, Caplin & Drysdale concerns

22

section 853(c), which is the criminal forfeiture provision

23

that deals with proceeds, cash, and in that case, of

24

course, the question was whether money that the drug

25

dealer wanted to pay to his lawyer, whether the relation10

1

back provision applied to that, and the Court said

2

absolutely, positively it applies to that.

3

cash is generated through a drug transaction, it belongs

4

to the United States, and you know, to quote the Court,

5

there's no right to give someone else's money to a third

6

party.

So, yes.

The answer is yes in Caplin & Drysdale.

But that -- it was still

I'm talking about have we

10

ever followed the money to a later person and said that

11

the forfeiture of that money subsists?
MS. WAX:

12

Well, I'm not aware right off the top

13

of my head of a case in which this Court has.

Certainly

14

it has been common practice in the courts of appeals.

15

QUESTION:

I'm not aware that we've done it.

16

Have we ever followed that money to the purchase

17

of real estate and then followed the real estate the rest

18

of the way down the line when the real estate was not part

19

of the initial proceeds?
MS. WAX:

20
21

22

Not in any case of this Court that I'm

aware of.
But, Your Honor, to - - you have to go back to

the words of the statute to see that there's nothing

24

unusual or disturbing about that.

That's the

couldn't do that, then someone, a drug dealer, could take

his profits and essentially shelter them by just putting

them through one transaction.

knowledge, we've never done that except in the case where

20

the offending property itself is involved, not cash.

21

MS. WAX:

But, Your Honor, we clearly -- the

22

statute clearly allows you to do that here because the

statute says that all things of value furnished in

exchange for drugs are forfeitable.

25

It's different for the following

4

So, therefore, you still go after the money.
But if the doctor, in fact, had been the

Supposing the house doesn't sell for

MS. WAX:

I believe that the answer is that each

do, take the loss proportionately on that decline in the

And that is what the joint statement seems to indicate.

MR. PLAISTED:

Yes, Your Honor, and with respect

to proceeds, then that would often make sense.
In terms of - - as I had understood the

Government's argument previously, I thought they were

13

saying they did have the right to elect to go after even

14

bona fide purchasers in some instance, and even if it is

15

only in limited instances, it creates an anomaly and a

problem when you construe the criminal statute which

how to protect bona fide purchasers alone when they wanted

MR. PLAISTED:

Your Honor, I would - - as I had

16

understood the Government's brief, they were taking the

17

position -- if look at footnote 8, they had suggested in

18

footnote 8 that the innocent owner provision had meaning

19

only for people who took before the illegal transaction

20

not for anybody after.

21

Government's brief suggested that they were, in fact,

22

reserving the right to attack bona fide purchasers for

23

value.

24
25

And so, if one reads 8, the

If that was or if they are even reserving the
right to opt for that, then there is no meaning to the

innocent owner clause.

I mean, it becomes meaningless.

2

The example in 8 where they posit, well, it's -- and it

3

starts midway down through footnote 8 where they posit it

is possible for funds to be entrusted to a person and that

5

person subsequently uses them to engage in a drug

transaction without the owner's knowledge.

7

money might be turned over to a friend for investment.

So, A turns it over to B, a banker or a broker.

banker or the broker uses it instead for drugs, and then

The sum of

The

10

the Government later seizes proceeds.

11

posited in that case that that gave meaning to innocent

12

owner because the ownership was before the illegal acts,

13

and from that at least we drew that they were attacking

14

all bona fide purchasers or at least reserving the right

15

to.

16

The Government

If they are doing that, that particular section

17

provides -- when you read it, you never find an example

like that in any case cited to this Court.

suggested that in our brief and challenged the Government

20

to provide one, and they did not.

21

that, the example they proffer, it has no meaning either.

22

If A gives the money to B, B uses it, and the Government

23

seizes it, A going to the Government and saying, well, B

owes me money that I entrusted him to and you happened to

have seized proceeds from this fellow, turn them over to

I don't know how that problem of an

individual having no right to trace funds just exists with

respect to the Government -- Government's example and

doesn't exist later down the line where you would apply

the same clause to funds that have been taken by the

I don't see why that's the Government's problem.
MR. PLAISTED:

21

23

Why doesn't the same problem exist for you?

I'm not sure I understand, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, you say that the private owner

of funds cannot trace funds.

Only the Government can

trace funds for some reason.

Right?

That's how you shoot

Of course, it applies to other things of value

MR. PLAISTED:

Funds are - -

What they were saying was that

later on innocent owners could not take because if they're

taking after the date of the criminal act, they take

nothing.
