ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. LARKIN, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. LARKIN:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves a First Amendment challenge

12

13

by a radio station to Congress' regulatory program for

14

broadcast lottery advertising.

15

title 18 create a simple bright line geographically based

16

rule under which a station's right to broadcast lottery

17

advertising hinges on the state to which that radio

18

station is licensed.

Sections 1304 and 1307 of

A radio station licensed to a state like

19
20

Virginia that runs a state lottery can broadcast lottery

21

advertising about that state's lottery or any other state

22

lottery.

23

like North Carolina without a state lottery cannot

24

broadcast lottery advertising about any state lottery.

25

is the validity of that bright line rule that is at issue

By contrast, a radio station licensed to a state

It

2

as applied to respondent in this case.
The district court in a divided panel of the

3

Fourth Circuit held this regulatory program

4

unconstitutional under the commercial speech standard this

5

Court adopted in the Central Hudson case.

6

reasoned that Congress had legitimate and substantial

7

interests involved in helping the states pursue their

8

policies towards gambling.

9

that this regulatory program was narrowly tailored to

Those courts

Those courts also concluded

achieve that end.

11

Nonetheless, those courts held these statutes

12

unconstitutional as applied to respondent on the ground

13

that in that circumstance it did not directly advance

14

Congress' goals.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Larkin, under a First Amendment

16

analysis in commercial speech cases when we apply Central

17

Hudson do we look case-by-case at an as-applied challenge

18

or do we simply look to whether the Central Hudson test is

19

met and it's a reasonable response to the overall problem?

20

Is there such a thing as an as-applied case-by-case look

21

in the analysis?

22

MR. LARKIN:

Your Honor, the as-applied type of

23

challenge that I think the court contemplated under the

24

commercial speech basis is a challenge that would go to

25

show that a particular broadcast in this case should not

QUESTION:

But as applied here insofar as it

addresses the problem of a commercial advertisement, do we

10

look at some case-by-case approach and say well, look, in

11

this case it's so close to the border it's ridiculous as

12

applied to Edge?
MR. LARKIN:

13

No, Your Honor, you don't.

Both

contrary.

In the case of - -

I'm not sure the precedent is all

that clear, so I'm interested to hear your response.
MR. LARKIN:

In the case of Ward v. Rock Against

19

Racism this Court addressed a similar argument.

20

case people were using the band shell in New York City

21

Central Park.

22

as a time, place, and manner regulation of the speech.

23

required people using the band shell to use city equipment

24

and have a city employee run it.

In that

two competing goals, competing goals much like the

2

competing goals at issue here.

3

concerts were loud enough so that they could be heard by

4

concert goers but not so loud that they would disrupt the

5

surrounding communities.

6

It was to insure that the

The argument that was made on behalf of Rock

7

Against Racism is that regulation doesn't serve its

8

purposes as applied to us because we're loud enough so

9

that everybody hears us.

10
11

There is no need to worry about

whether or not that goal is served.
This Court rejected that argument.

The Court

12

said that the validity of a time, place, and manner

13

regulation serves on the general purposes that the

14

Government seeks to serve through the regulation and not

15

on how it's applied in an individual case.

16

One week later in the case of SUNY v. Fox this

17

Court said that the analysis under a time, place, and

18

manner regulation is substantially similar to the analysis

19

that is applied in the commercial speech area.

20

We think the combination of those two cases as a

21

matter of precedent indicates that you don't look at a

22

station-by-station approach, you don't undertake that type

23

of analysis to decide in this case whether Congress'

24

regulation of the broadcast spectrum is permissible.

25

QUESTION:

So we just apply Central Hudson?

1

Correct.

You look in this case to

see whether the legislative judgment is reasonable.

QUESTION:

Well, do we have to ask for instance

whether there is a substantial Government interest in, in

about what goes on in Virginia?

MR. LARKIN:

9

about what goes on in Virginia.

In protecting North Carolina citizens from knowing

I wouldn't say it's from knowing
We're not seeking to

10

suppress general information.

What Congress has sought to

11

do here is accommodate the conflicting goals of Virginia

12

and North Carolina.

13

QUESTION:

Virginia believes -What is North Carolina's goal insofar

14

as it deals with commercial speech about something going

15

on lawfully in Virginia?
MR. LARKIN:

16

North Carolina's interest in not

17

having its citizens participate in gambling.

18

Carolina doesn't permit private lotteries on a large scale

19

basis, it doesn't run a state lottery, because it's

12

But certainly the people in North

13

Carolina can hear ads in a Virginia licensed station,

14

can't they?

15

MR. LARKIN:

If they are in a community that is

16

close to the border and if the border state has a lottery,

17

as it does here, and the broadcast airwaves cross state

18

lines, as they do, that can happen.

reasonable for Congress to focus its statutes on the

MR. LARKIN:

Well, I'm told by the FCC that on

average there is a 50-mile radius for broadcast lottery,

circumstances.

So you have that situation which

QUESTION:

Was it a condition of licensure that

the transmitter be located in North Carolina?
MR. LARKIN:

9

No, it was not a condition, and in

10

fact you can have your transmitter located in a different

11

state.

12

this case the community is the Elizabeth City community.

The license requires you to serve a community, in

13

Why do we know that this is a North

What they are

But is it not true that -- how much

when, as I understand it, Elizabeth City represents only 4

MR. LARKIN:

It is totally irrelevant?
Yes.
Even though they have, I guess they

there's no statutory objection to an audience that, you

could pose to a lot of people who want to buy lottery

when you have scarce frequencies.

But they are

2

authorized, as I understand it, not merely to license, to

broadcast to the small community but to a larger audience

that mostly includes Virginia residents.

is you use the term authorized.

That's not the way the

It's not as if they are given the authority

QUESTION:

10

But is it not true that if their

11

broadcasting into Virginia interfered with the signals of

12

other, of Virginia stations in Virginia they would then be

13

subject to some kind of restriction from the FCC?

MR. LARKIN:

Yes.

If their broadcast --

So they are, they are authorized in

the sense that the license allows them to do that without

any Federal objection.
MR. LARKIN:

18

Well, for different purposes.

In

other words they are authorized in the sense that there is

20

a different Federal law that governs licensing and it

21

doesn't forbid them from conducting the broadcasts in the

22

way they do here.

23

that the statutes that they have challenged here as

applied to them permits them to engage in this type of

activity.

QUESTION:

Is the licensee, is the license

2

conditioned on obeying governing Federal statutes relating

3

to, such as the one we've got before us?

4

MR. LARKIN:

5

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

If they --

So this station clearly is not

6

authorized to broadcast gambling information to, from

7

where it is.

8

9

MR. LARKIN:

That's right.

And if they violate

this law they can not only be criminally prosecuted under

10

title 18, they can have, when their license comes up for

11

renewal they can have their license taken away from them.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Larkin, I didn't, I guess I knew

13

but I had forgotten that you didn't have to have your

14

transmitter located within the community that you're

15

licensed to serve.

16

one of the things that supported your position or the

17

Government's position is that it, the Government certainly

18

might think it unreasonable to permit the state law to be

19

violated on the very ground of the state by transmitting

20

from its own soil advertisements that are against its

21

public policy.

I suppose -- and I had thought that

22

But as I understand the way things can work, if

23

you had a transmitter, if you had a station licensed to a

24

community which permitted gambling you could have your

25

transmitter located across the border in a state that bans

1

gambling and you could broadcast from that state gambling

2

announcements which would go to the community to which

3

you're licensed since that community permits it, and would

4

also go to the people within that state that you're

5

broadcasting from, which is not the community you are

6

licensed to serve.

7

Am I correct about that?

MR. LARKIN:

Yes, that's my understanding, that

8

you could have a situation in the way you posit it.

9

the reason it's a reasonable scheme here is that different

10

states have adopted their policies and you are licensed to

11

serve a community within that state.

12

the laws of that state by broadcasting the advertisements,

13

regardless of physically where they actually happen to

14

emanate from, you are disserving the policies of the state

15

that you are licensed by the FCC to serve.

16

the key ingredients of the licensing scheme.

17

QUESTION:

But

If you are violating

That is one of

Is it often true that you're licensed

18

to a community that contains only 4 to 5 percent of your

19

listening audience?

20

MR. LARKIN:

That seems very strange to me.
Often?

I wouldn't say it's often,

21

but what I would say is this.

If you are in a community

22

that is rather sparsely populated it probably becomes

23

easier to obtain a license to serve that community than it

24

would be if you are trying to seek a new license in New

25

York City, for example, where there are numerous stations.

1

If there aren't very many stations in the area, or perhaps

2

if there are none, that you are trying to serve, it

3

becomes that much easier to show that you will be able to

4

meet a need in that community that is not now being met.

5

Now, what you can have in a situation then is

6

somebody come in and try to serve the interests of that

community and, if you will, also try to serve perhaps the

8

surrounding community.
QUESTION:

Or vice versa.

all the time, Mr. Larkin, that in fact whoever got the

words about the first point we have made in our brief

from illegal gambling.

always seems to have been a black market available.

9

Because they are deemed harmful to individuals in society

10

the society has always attempted to regulate them heavily

11

and sometimes flatly to ban them altogether, as most

12

states do in connection with casino gambling.
In some instances, however, society can

13
14

rationally conclude that the costs of a flat prohibition

15

are too injurious for society to bear, and as the result

16

the appropriate approach to undertake is the one that

17

Professor Epstein has called damage control, legalization

18

and regulation where the regulation includes a ban on the

19

advertising of that activity.

to gambling, with respect to alcohol, and other similar

11

MR. LARKIN:

Yes.
You would say that this activity

should be treated in the same way as illegal activity, and

that that wouldn't be protected.

There are certain counties in

Nevada, for example, that have legalized prostitution.

The First Amendment doesn't prohibit them from undertaking

As the result,

society has to regulate it rather than prohibit it.

That's the way we think that the types of instances that

are discussed in Posadas can reasonably be tied together.

4

Let me say just a few brief words about the

We think that essentially the theory

6

adopted by the lower courts and urged by respondents is

one of under-inclusiveness, and we think that under­

what I put to you is if they do that, as you say they do,

I

mean, what case of ours do you rely on in the commercial
speech context to give it the kind of individual focus

MR. SHUMADINE:

There would be two.

In the

case distinguishing a Sixth Circuit case based upon a

14

different fact.

said, and I am quoting from pages 475 and 476 of that

opinion, the court of appeals did not decide however

whether the law directly advances these interests and

whether the regulation it imposes is more extensive than

is necessary for that purpose.

findings had to be made.

That was dealing with the fourth

MR. SHUMADINE:

Well, Your Honor, it would seem

to me plain that in reading SUNY, and that was what the

district judge did because it came out immediately prior

to our decision, he read it very carefully.

15

very difficult to say we're going to have factual findings

You think the burden is on the

MR. SHUMADINE:

It seems to me if the, as this

Court has said, the test is directly advanced.

5

has placed, I believe in Zauderer, in Fox, and in other

6

cases, the burden on the Government to show that the

Now it seems to me that places a burden on the Government

to show something, and that something I would suggest

This Court

according to SUNY must be in the empirical real world - QUESTION:

Then you're saying that the

a First Amendment basis must offer empirical evidence that

the statute is effective for its purpose?

proposition that the Government must offer empirical

evidence so that you have an actual factual determination?

believe that if SUNY was sent back for factual findings,

to the trial court to take evidence and to make the type

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Shumadine, you may

MR. SHUMADINE:

5

Justice Souter, as I remember

6

your question it was asking about the fourth prong of the

7

Central Hudson test, and I was starting to reply to say

8

that it would obviously be more rational and more

9

effective to utilize the audience served as opposed to the

10

station of license.

11

Carolinians from receiving advertisements the Government

12

obviously could prohibit the advertisements being

13

broadcast to stations with audiences in North Carolina.

14

As you are aware, the FCC license has a filing that

15

demonstrates both the strength of the signal and the area

16

covered, and you can determine the audience from that if

17

you wanted to with some degree of precision.
QUESTION:

18

If you wanted to prevent North

Well, that's true, but the fourth

19

prong simply requires that the regulation not be more

20

extensive.

21

This isn't more extensive, is it?
MR. SHUMADINE:

I think it is to the extent that

22

it picks up stations like Edge where it has no effect or

23

it doesn't accomplish any governmental purpose.

something.

4

the station at all, those people are not going to be

5

6

to me that given the fact that there will be some effect

it's difficult to argue under the fourth prong that the

regulation in the Central Hudson words is more extensive

9

than is necessary.

It accomplishes

Assuming that there are people listening to

It may not pick up much, but I'm not

10

sure that it's more extensive than is necessary.

11

is, it is not -- your argument is that it's ineffective,

12

which it seems to me is a different concept.
MR. SHUMADINE:

13

It just

I have conceded that my primary

14

argument is that it is ineffective, but if you were to, as

15

I read the Discovery Network case that just came down 2

16

weeks ago, I believe even there that statute was effective

17

as to about 100 out of the 3,000, or 169 out of the 3,000

that it has some marginal effect, I don't know if that

saves it.

QUESTION:

So the fact

Yes, but it's only marginal because

22

you're just talking about Edge, and if you talk about all

MR. SHUMADINE:

Is that the way you approach

I believe it is, Your Honor, and

12

it's certainly the way that this Court has always

13

approached constitutional questions.

14

of cases where this Court has said that you look at the

15

statute as it is applied to a particular litigant to

16

determine its constitutionality as to that litigant.

17

There are cases that say that's a wise and beneficent

18

policy because it allows this Court not to overturn more

19

of the statute than is necessary.

20

cases we cited in the brief where this Court has

21

overturned the application of a statute as applied to a

22

particular litigant while it has allowed the statute to be

23

applicable as to other litigants.

and on a specific record the statute cannot have

2

unconstitutional applications.

3

QUESTION:

But haven't we said, Mr. Shumadine,

4

that when we're talking about commercial speech the

5

legislature can enact a prophylactic rule which it

6

couldn't in connection with straight First Amendment

7

speech that may reach out a little more broadly than you

8

could in First Amendment orthodox?

9

MR. SHUMADINE:

In a facial challenge this Court

10

has said that it defers to a legislative judgment.

11

don't think this Court has ever said is that if a litigant

12

proves that in a specific case the legislative judgment

13

does not apply and the statute is really ineffective on a

14

real record with real evidence that the statute can be

15

applied to that case.

16

QUESTION:

What I

Do you think in a commercial speech

17

case that if a plaintiff can show that there is one in his

18

particular example, the thing does not satisfy the four

19

prongs, even though it does in 99 percent of the other

20

cases, that litigant can have that statute struck down as

21

to him?

22

MR. SHUMADINE:

That would be my belief, yes.

23

That is the teaching that I believe this Court has said

24

individual class of litigants it was unconstitutional.

When you struck down the solicitation rules in NAACP v.

Button you did not strike the lawyer solicitation rules

down in general.

6

It is a well established, I suggest, rule of

this Court that you can look at a specific record and look

at the application of a statute to a specific litigant and

protect that litigant's constitutional rights --

QUESTION:

So we can ban billboards on the

11

grounds that we want to improve the looks of a city, but

12

then a billboard company comes in and says look, we're in

13

a very shabby part of the city, the place is a mess

14

anyway, it doesn't really make that much difference.

Well, I thought your submission was

that if the statute does not serve the interest in the

MR. SHUMADINE:

I did make that submission, and

the only reason I did not endorse that example is that I

record to see whether it was effective.

If it was totally

2

ineffective, if you said everyone can have billboards

3

except one person, and if you were going to have 10,000
billboards anyway and you were banning 20 additional ones,

5

then I think there would be a real problem.

6

I think it's very important in an as-applied

7

challenge, and we tried very carefully to say this, to

8

stick to the record as made.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Shumadine, it seems to me

10

although you emphasize in answering Justice Kennedy's

11

question the particularity of the exception that you're

12

arguing for, at least in the context of FCC licensing if

13

we accepted your argument it would be a very broad

14

exception because you in effect would be saying that only,

15

that this particular regulation would be enforceable only

16

with respect to broadcasters over a geographical area

17

which do not receive, as it were, the forbidden broadcasts

18

from outside and which do not in turn broadcast to a

19

substantial audience outside the area in which the

20

activity is forbidden.

21

there might be some kind of enclave in the center of large

22

states in which the regulation would be enforceable, but

23

I'm not sure that it would be enforceable anywhere else.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LARKIN:

16

Your Honor, I have nothing further

to add unless the Court has any further questions.
QUESTION:

17

Is part of your submission, Mr.

18

Larkin, that there is a waiver, an estoppel aspect to this

1

case, to speak in loose terms, that this licensee really

20

submitted itself to the jurisdiction of North Carolina and

21

is stuck by its license, or does that drop out of the case

22

and this is simply a case in which you win under Central

Hudson?

MR. LARKIN:

We don't make an estoppel or a

waiver type of argument.

We do think we win under Central
