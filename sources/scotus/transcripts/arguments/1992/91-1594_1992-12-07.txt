ORAL ARGUMENT OF PARKER D. THOMSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. THOMSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves one specific narrow

12

prohibition by Florida of the conduct of Florida licensed

13

certified public accountants.

14

by the legislature by statute, and by the State Board of

15

Accountancy which licenses CPA's by rule.

16

It is a prohibition imposed

The prohibition is of cold call solicitation of

17

new clients -- what the statute and the rule called

18

direct, in-person, uninvited solicitation.

19

The conduct is one defined as solicitation which

20

directly or implicitly requests an immediate oral response

21

from the recipient.

22

with political speech or artistic speech, we are involved

23

with the most blatant of commercial speech implemented

24

through conduct of the most confrontational.

this one question?
You -- in your brief you do the same thing, you

talk about it calls for an immediate response.

Would it

also be prohibited -- your rule also apply to a

solicitation by an accountant who did not ask for an

6

immediate response, if he just said I -- went in and made

7

the presentation and said, think it over and whenever

8

you're interested, let me know?

MR. THOMSON:

The definition in the statute -- I

oral response.

would be direct, in person, and uninvited.

reason I ask, it seems to me, judging from my practice as

17

a lawyer, not as an accountant, in trying to put it in

present-day terms, it seems to me if I were trying to get

a client and had a presentation to make I wouldn't demand

20

that the person make an immediate response.

imprison them verbally.

MR. THOMSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

Excuse me.

My question was, did the State of

Florida or agency have some sort of empirical evidence

10

before it that this sort of request, with a request for an

11

immediate answer, was common or prevalent among

12

accountants?

13

MR. THOMSON:

No, Your Honor.

There is no

14

empirical evidence, any more than that there is empirical

15

evidence that was dealt with by this Court in the Ohralik

16

case with respect to lawyers which you mentioned and where

17

also there is a broad-scale prohibition of direct, in-

18

person, uninvited solicitation.

19

QUESTION:

Does the agency advance any

20

particular reason why it selected this kind of conduct, if

21

there were no empirical evidence why it picked out this

22

demand for an immediate response?

23

MR. THOMSON:

There are two basic reasons that

24

go to the two basic purposes of the governance of

25

certified public accountants in the State of Florida.

The

1

statute with respect to certified public accountants says

2

that the first purpose is to assure the accuracy of audit

3

statements upon which the public relies, and the second is

4

to protect the public from dishonest practitioners.

5

Taking the latter one first, the communication

6

made in this fashion is inherently unregulatable.

tone, what-have-you, and therefore it is beyond the

QUESTION:

Mr. Thomson, does Florida have the

same prohibition on the books with regard to attorneys?

Yes.

It is done through the

MR. THOMSON:

No - - Your Honor, I cannot answer

15

your question specifically, but I believe that there are

other -- there are other of the so-called learned

17

professions in which there are such prohibitions.

18

there are ones in respect to engineers.

many, many years, and that is the case of -- that is the

there were similar prohibitions.

10

QUESTION:

Did the legislature command this sort

of a regulation?
MR. THOMSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

It is a specific

provision of the Florida statute governing certified
public accountants, chapter 473 of the Florida statute.

11

QUESTION:

And the board --

12

MR. THOMSON:

I might say, Your Honor, that the

13

prohibition in the statute is of direct, in-person,

14

uninvited solicitation.

15

an immediate response is by rule of the Board of Public

16

Accountants.

you think that was sort of just added by the regulation?
MR. THOMSON:

I'm clear that it was added.

was a construct of the State board as to how it

interpreted direct, uninvited, in-person solicitation.

7

QUESTION:

It

Is that an authoritative

interpretation?
MR. THOMSON:

Oh, yes, it is an authoritative

8

interpretation in that the State board is authorized to

9

adopt rules to carry forward the legislative mandate.

10
11

QUESTION:

So we should regard the statute,

then, as meaning that, as requiring an immediate response.

12

MR. THOMSON:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

That is correct, Your Honor.

That's how you want us to interpret

that statute for purposes of this case.
MR. THOMSON:

Well, I believe, as I said, Your

16

Honor, that the statute stands on its own, but it has been

17

interpreted by an administrative agency that has the power

18

to interpret it.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Well, the court of appeals didn't

make much of the immediate response business, did they?
MR. THOMSON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

majority of the court of appeals simply struck it all.

elided the two.

rule unconstitutional, is that right?

2

MR. THOMSON:

3

QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.

Do you make any argument that they

4

should have tried to save possible applications of the

5

statute to extreme cases of overreaching or anything like

6

that, or do you say the whole ball of wax is at issue?

7
8

9

MR. THOMSON:

I believe the whole ball of wax

clearly is at issue.
QUESTION:

Even though it's conceivable that

10

some applications of the rule might be entirely legitimate

11

even under the court of appeals reasoning, if the

12

accountant went and engaged in the very extreme kind of

13

behavior that was in Ohralik, for example.

14

MR. THOMSON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The

15

statute has been stricken as to all of its applications

16

with one -- with one caveat, and that is that the end line

17

of the decision of the Federal district court was that

18

what should be in the business context.

21

22

23

QUESTION:

But other than that let me -- well,

it's the district court.
MR. THOMSON:

That is the district court, and

its determination was affirmed.
QUESTION:

Well, are you asking us to save as

24

much of the statute as can be saved under the

25

Constitution?

Mr. Chief Justice, we are asking

you to save the entire statute under the Constitution.

QUESTION:

Well, supposing we were to conclude

Clearly, there are some CPA's that

covers them as well, doesn't it?

MR. THOMSON:

Of course, Your Honor.

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

The

1

statute covers any person who performs accounting

2

functions as a CPA, and I submit to Your Honor that to the

3

layman the difference between attest and performing

4

accounting functions as a CPA is a distinction without a

5

difference.

6

Now, in terms of the ultimate -- in terms of the

7

ultimate use of financial statements, to be sure, attest

8

has a very significant difference, and it is the ultimate
protection of the attest function that is one of, or the

10

11

most principal requirements and concerns of the statute.
But in fact a CPA is a person who performs

12

accounting functions as a CPA -- compilations, and so

13

forth -- and when you go to the small business that

14

Mr. Fane says that he wishes to secure, corporate and

15

commercial clients that have sufficiently complex

16

accounting and taxation needs to justify the retention of

17

a highly skilled accountant, the difference between an

18

attest function and a compilation function or something

1

else that is accounting services, I suggest is a

20

distinction that the average layman is not likely to

21

understand.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Thomson, can I come back to what

23

you call the - - what the unzipper feature of the stat - -

24

we do have an overbreadth doctrine in First Amendment

Can that doctrine be overruled by simply saying

MR. THOMSON:

QUESTION:

9

to the extent that this

No --

Can a stroke of the pen do away with

our overbreadth doctrine?
MR. THOMSON:

Well,

it's unlikely that any

10

Florida statute can get rid of United States Supreme

11

Court's overbreadth doctrine, but historically the statute

12

came about - - it was actually part of the rewriting of the

13

law in 1979, at a time when Bates had been decided,

14

Ohralik had been decided, Primus had been decided.

15

My suspicion, although there is no clear

16

legislative history, of the words, except to the extent

17

that such solicitation constitutes the exercise of

18

constitutionally protected speech as determined by the

19

rules of the board, was designed to pick up issues like

20

Primus in case there were some kind of semipolitical

21

speech rather than the uncontrovertible commercial speech

22

that is involved in this case.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Thomson, do you think that the

24

overbreadth doctrine applies to commercial speech

regulations?

Well, going back to Bates,

that a primary emphasis of the profession involved is on

social responsibility over individual gains with respect

to the accountants, their public function, and one

definition, or one restriction that could clearly be

looked at, is where the legislature has chosen to apply a

privilege to the communications between the users of that

service and the service itself, which would be true of

accountants and attorneys.

We are not suggesting, however, that it would

understanding that the statute says it's -- to the extent

2

that such solicitation constitutes the exercise of

3

constitutionally protected speech as determined by the

4

rules of the board, and then the rules of the board define

5

direct, in-person, uninvited solicitation as those that

6

directly or implicitly request an immediate, oral response

7

from the recipient.
Does that mean that, under your understanding of

8

9

the rules construing the statute, that if the oral

10

solicitation did not request an immediate response, it

11

would not be prohibited by the statute because the rules

12

have construed the statute to limit them in this fashion?
MR. THOMSON:

13

At this point of time, Your Honor,

14

yes -- that is, that the board has authoritatively

15

determined the meaning of the prohibition.

16

did it for the reasons that they were attempting to

17

constitute, or determine what constituted the exercise of

evident in anything that is clear from the adoption of the

rule.

Is there any evidence in this case

How has the board manifested to you

its view that this conduct would be proscribed?
MR. VLADECK:

The board has said that any

poses the fear that there will be an abuse in the

18

solicitation process, or that it will impair the public's

perception as to the integrity of financial statements,

and therefore the board has taken the position throughout

this litigation that any direct face-to-face or telephone

3

Which, if I may, Your Honor, gets me back to my

We didn't label

this as a facial, or as an as-applied challenge.

11

I think if you look at our complaint, it is more

12

clearly an as-applied challenge, because in our complaint,

3

we specify precisely the conduct in which Mr. Fane seeks

4

to engage, and we certainly pushed the district court

5

towards issuing an order that was limited towards

6

solicitation in the business context, or business clients.

7

And in that respect I think the complaint is

8

very much like the kind of challenge that was described by

9

this Court in Fox, which is a narrow tailoring challenge.

20

That is, the kind of challenge that doesn't apply --

2

doesn't seek to have the statute struck down as facially

22

overbroad, but challenges one particular application to

that statute, and here, it's for the kind of business

24

prohibition remained in force until 1948, when the AICPA

everything of the sort.

That

In 1973, the Justice Department Antitrust

Division first contacted the AICPA to explain that it

thought the rules were anticompetitive and violative of

the antitrust laws.

17

Finally, in 1979, threatened with imminent

18

litigation by the Justice Department, the AICPA withdrew

19

its solicitation ban and issued a report called the Report

20

on Solicitation, which is contained in the Joint Appendix,

21

which takes the position that there is no evidence

whatsoever that in-person solicitation by CPA's leads to

either of the concerns the State claims to fear.

That is, abuse of the attest function, or
overreaching by CPA's who engage in solicitation, and the

telephone calls, denies him the opportunity to communicate

The other point I'd make is, not

been any problems with abusive solicitation.

difficulties.
I'd like to say briefly a word about the time-

2

3

place -manner doctrine argument that the defendants have

4

made as well.

5

not believe the time-place-manner argument applies, and

6

let me just highlight two of our most fundamental

7

concerns.

We have explained in our brief why we do

8

The first is,

there's no question in our view

9

that this is a content-based ban.

Like all restraints on

10

commercial speech,

the solicitation ban picks out the

11

particular form of communication and regulates it, and

12

this Court's jurisprudence has made clear that content-

13

based regulations are not subject to review under the

14

time-place-manner doctrine.
In the commercial speech area, we submit they

15
16

are reviewable under the Central Hudson test which we

17

believes govern, and indeed, all of this Court's prior

18

cases involving lawyer advertising, professional

19

advertising regulation, had been decided under the Central

20

Hudson test, not under the time-place-manner doctrine.

21

The second point that we think is pertinent is

22

that the defendant's argument really seems to make a

23

fortress out of the dictionary by equating the word manner

24

with mode.

25

entire mode of communication, and this Court's opinions by

Here, this regulation seeks to suppress an

1

and large have said that where the regulation completely

2

prohibits a particular mode of expressive activity, it

3

ought not to be judged under the time-place-manner

4

standard.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Vladeck, supposing that you were

6

in complete agreement with Mr. Thomson that the only way

7

the board sought to -- and the only kind of conversation

8

the board sought to prohibit was those demanding an

9

immediate answer, would you still say that that was not a

10

time, place, and manner regulation, if he could

11

communicate everything he wanted to but couldn't demand an

12

immediate answer?
MR. VLADECK:

13

No, Your Honor, I would still say

14

that that was a content-based restraint in that he could

15

say, I'd like you to consider hiring me, I'm extremely

16

well qualified, here are the services I render and the

17

fees I charge, but he couldn't say, and please let me know

18

soon.

MR. VLADECK:

have to be judged under the commercial speech test, and it

2

would either rise or fall on whether it passed muster

would have far more appeal than the restraint that the

board throughout this litigation says it intends to

impose.

QUESTION:

It seems to me that that restraint

Well, Your Honor, there are two

There is --

Is it all right for us to prefer

that?
MR. VLADECK:

There's an interrorum effect.

The

7

uncertainty would chill Mr. Fane's speech.

8

couldn't go to the court to get a resolution of whether

9

his conduct was permissible or not, Mr. Fane and probably

20
21

If Mr. Fane

many other CPA's would sit on the sidelines.
And let me point out, Your Honor, this isn't the

22

only case that was brought to challenge this restraint.

23

There is another case that is now pending in the Florida

24

State courts that preceded Mr. Fane's case, during which

25

the board has taken what we thought was the board's

1

unequivocal position in this case, which is that any

2

unsupervised contact either on the phone or face-to-face

3

between a CPA and someone who is not that person's client

4

is forbidden under the Florida rules, and so this is not a

5

case, at least in our minds, as to which there is any

6

uncertainty at all as to the board's position.

QUESTION:

They didn't -- when -- this has

8

already been remarked upon.

9

and said what he wanted to do, the board didn't say go

When you filed your complaint

ahead and do it.
MR. VLADECK:

11

No.

In fact, they have

12

vigorously, vigorously litigated this case at every turn,

13

even though we have --we put it in our complaint, we put

14

it in our affidavits, we have always clearly explained

15

precisely the kind of conduct in which Mr. Fane seeks to

engage.

Does the record say anything at all

19

about the rates he proposed to charge as compared with the

20

prevailing rates?

21

QUESTION:

6

And you're telling us that this

regulation was duly enacted by the board.

7

MR. THOMSON:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

8

what I started to say is, I do not want to suggest to this

9

Court that the board is going to look -- would look

10

favorably on a request because it is their assumption that

11

it would implicitly respond.
They did not intend, I believe, to rewrite the

12

3

statute as was -- to gut the statute, which is what was

4

the suggestion, perhaps, by some of the questions that

5

were previously asked.
QUESTION:

In fact, the next sentence in the

regulation makes that rather clear.

MR. THOMSON:

QUESTION:

Uninvited, in-person visits, and so

forth, are prohibited.

matter.

type of solicitation is made that a response is at least

2

implicitly called for, and I do not want to suggest to the

3

contrary.

4

Mr. Dooner's affidavit was before the Court,

5

Mr. Dooner said what he did, and that is in fact the way

6

it went forward for determination by the Federal district

7

judge and by the court of appeals.
QUESTION:

8

9

But the second sentence that Justice

Stevens just referred to does say uninvited, in-person

10

visits or conversations or telephone calls to a specific

11

potential client are prohibited.
Now, does that mean ones that demand immediate

12

3

oral response, or just across-the-board they're

4

prohibited?
MR. THOMSON:

5

Your Honor, I believe, reading the

6

two sentences together, that there is an assumption that

7

when such a call is made that it implicitly -- at least

8

implicitly requests a response.
QUESTION:

9
20

Even though no such response is

requested by the caller.
MR. THOMSON:

21

Absolutely if no response -- the

22

question was asked to me before, what if I don't want your

23

response?

24

which it was specifically negated, but I do say -- believe

25

if the person makes a cold call and says nothing, he

expects a response.

2

QUESTION:

It seems to me, Mr. Thomson, that the

3

whole purpose of that which directly or implicitly

4

requests an immediate oral response is simply to

5

distinguish the situation described in the last sentence,

6

indirect forms of -- such as giving speeches.

7

When you give a speech, you don't expect

8

somebody in the audience to get up and say,

9

sounds pretty good to me,

10

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

oh, that

can you give me a little more --

Isn't that the only purpose of it,

12

really, and that they're really saying you cannot make

13

person-to-person oral contact?

14

MR. THOMSON:

15

the statute - - as I said before,

QUESTION:

Well,

I do not believe that the

What do you say the State's interest

is in doing that?

19

MR. THOMSON:

The State's interest is dual.

20

With respect to the attest function,

it is to

21

assure the independence, and the apparent independence of

22

the certified public accountant which the board submits is
