ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you,'Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Well, the Court may begin its opinion in this

11

12

case in much the same way that it began its opinion in

13

Haslip, that is, that this case is yet another challenge

14

to a punitive damages award.

15

not involve just any old punitive damages award.

16

To be sure, this case does

The award here of $10 million for the tort of

17

slander of title is beyond rational explanation by

18

reference to any legitimate interests asserted by the

19

State of West Virginia and is the product of a procedural

20

scheme that bore no discernable relationship to the

21

procedural scheme that this Court reviewed and approved in

22

Haslip.

23

Indeed, the West Virginia Supreme Court's

24

judgment ultimately rests on a wholly arbitrary, really

25

mean versus really stupid, classification of defendants

1

that even the respondents do not defend in this Court.

2

Accordingly, that judgment should be reversed.

3

TXO was an oil and gas exploration company based

4

in Texas that opened an office in West Virginia in the

5

early 1980's.

6

Blevins tract in McDowell County, West Virginia, and

7

sought to obtain the oil and gas development rights to

8

that tract.

9

-- or excuse me.

In 1984, it first became interested in the

Those rights were held by Respondent Tug Fork
r

The title to the oil and gas was held by

10

Respondent Tug Fork, and the development rights were held

11

by Respondent Alliance Resources.

12

An agreement was reached between Alliance and

13

TXO that granted the latter the rights to the development.

14

TXO received a title opinion that indicated that there was

15

question as to whether or not a 1958 deed had, in fact,

16

conveyed Tug Fork's interest to a third party.

17

The question then was how to resolve that

18

problem, and TXO obtained a quitclaim deed from the

19

recipient of the rights in order to be in a position to

20

ensure that if it began to drill well -- drill a well on

21

that property and, in fact, successfully uncovered oil or

22

gas, that it would be able to take that oil and gas free

23

of any claims by this third party.

24

quitclaim deed, and then filed a declaratory judgment

25

action seeking to have the respective rights of the

parties resolved.
Respondents counterclaimed in that lawsuit for

2

3

slander of title based solely on TXO's action in recording

4

the quitclaim deed and sought both compensatory damages

5

and the punitive award.
The case was tried exclusively on respondents'

6

7

claim of slander of title.

8

compensatory relief on any other theory of the case, and

9

they did not submit an instruction to the jury with

Respondents did not seek
r

10

respect to any claim other than the straight slander of

11

title claim.

12

The jury was instructed with respect to the

13

punitive award that it could enter an award for three

14

purposes:

15

to others not to engage in such conduct, and to provide

16

unspecified, quote, additional compensation.

17

arriving at a punitive amount, the jury should consider

18

the nature of the wrongdoing, the extent of the harm

19

inflicted, the intent of the defendant, the wealth of the

20

perpetrator, as well as any mitigating factors, which were

21

unspecified by the court.

to punish the wrongdoer, to serve as an example

back with a proposal that suggests that the evidence in

MR. PHILLIPS:

1

Meets all -- well, actually what

2

they argue is that it meets the standards that the Court

3

sort of noted in Haslip as the Green, Alabama factors.

4

In truth, I think if you were to look at the

5

four factors that the jury was asked to look at, it would

6

be very difficult to reach the conclusion that the jury

7

could have come to a $10 million verdict based on these

8

factors.

9

what we are talking about here is slander of title,

If you consider the nature of the wrongdoing,
r

10

nothing more.

11

are talking about a pure economic tort.

12

of the injury that was actually caused to the plaintiffs

13

as a consequence of this particular economic activity was

14

$19,000.

15

No physical injury was a possibility.

QUESTION:

We

The entire extent

Well, the Supreme Court of West

16

Virginia gave the impression I thought in its opinion not

17

that there was any physical -- but that your client acted

18

with malice in the really nasty sense of the word.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

The West Virginia Supreme Court

20

certainly seemed to indicate that, although it is a little

21

difficult to understand on this record on what basis you

22

would reach that conclusion in light of the slander of

23

title claim.

case, there was --

25

You will recall that in the trial of this

1

should - - I suppose we would not quarrel with that

2

judgment of the -- that there was malice.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there is no basis in the

4

jury's verdict necessarily to find malice because the jury

5

was told that it could award punitive damages simply for

6

reckless disregard and without malice.

7

not clear to me that as it comes to this Court, that there

8

is necessarily a jury finding of malice.

9

So, that -- it's

There is an

QUESTION:

Yes, but do you lose the case if we

assume there's malice?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh, no, of course not.

MR. PHILLIPS:

MR. PHILLIPS:

We don't

So - -

My basic point --

We're in agreement on that,

Justice White.
But my basic point is that as you evaluate the

20

relationship of the $10 million award, which is really

21

where I think you have to start the legal analysis against

22

what is going on here, in truth there isn't all that much

23

that is going on here.

•

gets you over the threshold of some punitive award, it
2

certainly doesn't take you into the $10 million range for

3

this kind of tort.

4

QUESTION:

But certainly if you're looking for

5

reasons why the jury might have found $10 million, it's

6

more likely that they found malice than that they simply

7

found reckless disregard.

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

Wouldn't you agree with that?
I would agree with that, Mr.
r

9

Chief Justice.

10

%

I would also, however, conclude that if you are

11

looking to how the jury got to a $10 million award in this

12

case, it is quite clear.

13

provided with evidence of the wealth of the defendant in

The question -- the jury was

the case, TXO, and was asked by counsel in closing
15

argument to award some percentage of that wealth over as a

16

punitive award, that that would be the fair way to

17

proceed.

record, frankly, that can you get anywhere near $10

19

million.

20

And that is the only numerical evidence in this

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, on that point, if the

21

State of West Virginia had had, prior to your client's

22

conduct here, a clear rule, whether it be a rule of

23

statute or previously announced common law, to the effect

24

that punitive damages may be awarded by reference not

25

merely to the verdict in the tort action, but by reference

to the extent - - the economic extent of the harm either

2

intended or potentially threatened by the tort, even

3

though not realized, would you say that there was either a

4

procedural or a substantive due process violation in

5

applying that rule?

Court to adopt - r

QUESTION:

That's how you get a basis for $10

million, if there is one, yes.
MR. PHILLIPS:

11

Right, and their -- and that is

12

part of their guest to come up with a number of $5 to $8

13

million because that is the potential gain.

still have a problem with that because you still have an

15

extraordinary award that is difficult to justify by

16

reference to the underlying conduct involved here, and --

We would

QUESTION:

Well, but let me start just with the

19

general proposition, which is what I was trying to get at

20

with my question.

21

-would there be a procedural or substantive due process

22

defect in that rule?

23

Would there be as a general judgment -

MR. PHILLIPS:

It is hard to evaluate it in the

24

abstract.

25

that could arise with that rule because in a situation

I think there would be a substantive problem

1

like this where you have a plaintiff, defendant dealing in

2

a particular transaction, the economic theory that tells

3

you that you are going to deter this conduct says you look

4

at the transaction and the actual profit, and you take

5

away all of the actual profit and then some multiple for

6

any instances in which engaging in this same conduct might

7

not actually be uncovered.

8

explained in the reply brief, you take away all possible

9

incentive for providing - - for going forward with that

If you do that, as we

10

kind of conduct, and you should, thereby, completely

11

deter.
Our position is whenever you get to the point

12

where you have put in all that retribution permits and you

14

put in all that deterrence will permit and you go beyond

that, that then you are, in effect, punishing the

innocent.

level.

18

So, there is a substantive problem even at that

The difficulty, obviously, is where you draw the

19

line, and if you had a situation, like you pose, where a

20

legislature has come in and tried to make some kind of an

21

assessment, I suspect the court ought quite rightly to be

somewhat deferential in how it evaluates whether or not

you've still crossed that line.

QUESTION:

But what you don't do - -

Why is it -- why is adopting a theory

of punitive damages any worse than adopting the whole

MR. PHILLIPS:

It's the timing of adopting the

theory of punitive damages.

to the jury this is the basis on which you should decide

You don't -- after the jury,

10

11

12

then come back in and say if we took those facts, as it

comes to us, if we take it on its own terms, we could not

14

conceive of getting to $10 million.

16

not conceivably have based the award on this, we will now

17

come in and urge you to affirm that verdict on that basis.

18

If this had been the issue in front of the jury, we would

19

have tried that issue and the expected gain would not have

20

been anywhere near the fabricated number that respondents'

21

counsel put forward.

Does the case boil down then to the

fact that you really do not dispute the position as a

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's it.
Yes.

It's a fairly narrow case then.

you to make an analysis of whether there's a reasonable

QUESTION:

Well --

12

million, it may well be a very worthy exercise, but I

13

think it's a little bit narrower than what you were saying
a minute ago.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

But see, I think the reason for

16

the way we view this I suppose in somewhat different terms

17

is we came to the case with what was in front of us in

18

West Virginia and brought that to the Court's attention as

19

an important issue on its own terms.

20

because they cannot defend the issue as it comes on its

21

own terms, have now tried significantly to shift the

22

Court's focus from the way it was decided below.

23

In responding to that point, what I am

The respondents,

24

suggesting to you is that there are procedural obstacles

to taking into account that argument.

Now, if the theory is constitutional -- and I

see no conceivable basis as a matter of substantive due

process for saying the State cannot use this as a way of

about what's the best way to deter.

And it's not a proper question for this

Do you go after people, whether they succeed or

In fact, in its

the view that it's for them to decide and that they think

precisely that it's perverse in terms of incentives and in

Because the West Virginia Supreme Court has

quite clearly rejected that approach and has said instead

11

you look to the expected gain, it seems to me that all

that's left is some possible procedural due process

arguments, and perhaps I should turn to those.

14

I don't think, by the way, that the Court ought

to reach the merits of some of the fancier procedural due

process arguments that we have here because TXO's only

argument at trial was about the First Amendment.

this Court to promulgate somehow for all 50 States --

their new rules about jury instructions and post-verdict

assign some special role to the trial judge post-verdict.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Let me just address a couple of points here.
First of all, you will notice that again, there

16

is no defense of the punitive award on the terms that it

17

was imposed by the jury and upheld by the West Virginia

18

Supreme Court in this case.

19

revealed quite plainly that he cannot defend it on that

20

ground, that he has to find some other ground by which to

21

justify this award and then invokes Nordlinger v. Hahn to

22

justify it.

23

QUESTION:

Indeed, I think Mr. Tribe

But he -- but he's responding to your

24

substantive due process argument.

substantive due process, isn't he right that so long as it

is sustainable on some rational basis?

for legislatures.

5

But for

That's what we do

Why is it any different for courts?

MR. PHILLIPS:

It is a huge difference for

6

courts because the punishment was imposed by the jury, and

7

what trying to sustain the jury's verdict on a ground not

8

in front of the jury does is ignore the potential of

9

passion and prejudice that undergirds the jury's --

QUESTION:

me, not substantive due process.
MR. PHILLIPS:

I think procedural and

substantive due process merge here, Justice Scalia.

14

not - - I am not here to defend across the board the

15

possibility that $10 million verdicts can never be entered

16

in any kind of case.

17

$10 million verdict in this case is grossly excessive, and

18

if this Court has meant what it said in the past, that

19

grossly -- that a State is no more permitted to assess a

20

grossly excessive damage award than it is to impose a

21

grossly excessive fine, this is the case that tests the

limits of that.

proceedings, wouldn't it have been reasonable to expect

3

that when they proposed a jury instruction that it would

4

have said you must measure this by the potential gain

rather than by the harm actually inflicted?

6

that this was not tried on that particular theory.
QUESTION:

7

It's clear

Well, they did refer, didn't they, in

the -- or the instruction referred to deterring other

conduct in other circumstances.

So’, I suppose that

MR. PHILLIPS:

But even -- but that -- I don't

supposed to follow, these elements which decide the amount

This is what describes how you get to $10

QUESTION:

Well, it may assume a degree of

20

analytical sophistication on the part of the jury, which

21

is a little bit generous, but when you start talking about

22

deterrence, what you're really talking about is deterrence

23

in relation to the temptation.

24

you're referring to by potential gain, isn't it?

MR. PHILLIPS:

And the temptation is what

of all this evidence about potential gain?

MR. PHILLIPS:

It was originally put into the

case because there was at one stage a claim that they were

going to make that there was a bad faith dealing here in

13

that when we capped the well, we actually deprived them of
a significant amount of money.

That was a separate

element.
