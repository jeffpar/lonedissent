ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. SEKULOW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Through the misapplication of section 2 of the

11

Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, the U.S. District Court for the

13

Eastern District of Virginia now monitors State trespass

16

It has been our position from the outset of this

The Fourth Circuit holding rests on two faulty

17

legal premises.

18

constitutes invidious discrimination against women, and

19

secondly, the district court further compounded its error

20

by misapplying this Court's jurisprudence with regard to

21

the constitutional right to interstate travel by finding

22

that petitioners' conduct would have an effect on

23

interstate travel and thereby purposely violating the

24

right to interstate travel.

4

Respondents' class theory converts any

Both the district court and the Fourth Circuit

5

Court of Appeals entered over a dozen specific findings of

6

facts dealing with the motivation or purpose of the

7

petitioners' activities; yet despite these specific

8

factual findings, the lower court came to the illogical

9

conclusion of law that opposition to abortion constitutes

10

invidious class-based discrimination against women.
That proposition has already been rejected by

11

12

this Court in finding that classifications based on

13

pregnancies do not constitute, per se, violations of equal

14

protection and do not constitute invidious discrimination.

15

That was in Geduldig.

16

This is especially so here, since the record

17

establishes clearly what motivates the petitioners'

18

conduct, and that is their opposition to the activity of

19

abortion.

20

using their opposition of abortion as a pretext to some

21

type of gender discrimination.

This is not a case where the petitioners are

Petitioners simply do not engage in the type of activity

2

and do not conduct their activities with the invidious

3

discriminatory animus required by section 2 of the Ku Klux

4

Klan Act of 1871.
As I said, there's redress available.

5
6

not a case where redress has been unavailable.

7

Petitioners have been the subject of State court

8

injunctions in other parts of the country.

9

This is

There's also an issue I think that's equally

10

important here, and that is the scope of the protections

11

under section 1985(3), which is section 2 of the act --of

12

the Ku Klux Klan Act.

13

drafted by Representative Willard.

14

to mark a boundary with regard to the overall scope of the

15

act.

There was a limiting amendment
The purpose of it was

16

Concerned over possible creations of a general

17

Federal tort law, the drafters of the limiting amendment

18

required that there not just be a deprivation of a right,

19

but there be a deprivation of equality, of equal

20

privileges and immunities, or equal protection of the law.
Thus, for a denial to be actionable pursuant to

21
22

the act, to be a conspiratorial objective, the

23

conspirators must seek to permit to some what they deny to

24

others.

25

scope of the petitioners' protest affects all involved in

Here, there's been no denial of equality.

that by simply being engaged in interstate travel and

They base this assertion on the theory

having that right affected by petitioners' conduct, that

11

the petitioners thereby purposely violated the

12

respondents' constitutional right to interstate travel.

13

That theory of the respondents would turn any

14

potential automobile accident involving an out-of-State

15

driver into an interstate travel claim, because it would

16

have an effect on interstate travel, and I would point out

17

that the Fourth Circuit in its findings of fact held that

petitioners' activities, if they were to have been engaged

in, would have had an effect on interstate travel.

the legislation the 42nd Congress made the determination

in the concept of the limiting amendment that they were

going to look at the issue through the lens of motivation

said that there was no district court finding with regard

to intent to interfere with travel.

I have before me the

11

finding that petitioners engaged in this conspiracy for

women seeking abortions and related medical and counseling

services of the right to travel.

QUESTION:

MR. SEKULOW:

The court --

Isn't that a finding of fact?
No.

That was a conclusion of law.

The finding of fact here states -- and it's on page 22(a)

19

of the joint -- the petition's appendix -- states, rescue

20

demonstrations -- paragraph 28 specifically.

21

demonstrations, by blocking access to clinics, therefore

22

have the effect of obstructing and interfering with

what the - - where the illogical conclusion of law took

place here.

3

QUESTION:

But the district judge did draw the

4

inference and stated in his conclusions of law that that

5

was the purpose.

6

MR. SEKULOW:

Yes.

However, our position is

7

that his -- that Judge Ellis, that the district court's

8

findings of fact clearly cut against that, Justice

9

Stevens, because his specific finding on right to travel

10

talks about effect, and there is a difference between

11

purpose and effect.

12

1985(3), section 2 of the Ku Klux Klan Act,

13

requires that there be a purposeful deprivation of the

14

right, not an impact, and that's what the motivation --

15

the view of what the motivation has to be on.

16

that motivated these petitioners?

their opposition to the activity of abortion.

may it please the Court:

2

The United States appears in this case not to

3

defend petitioners' tortious conduct, but to defend the

4

proper interpretation of section 1985(3).

5

explained in Griffin, the language of that section

6

covering conspiracies whose purpose is to deprive people

7

of equal protection or equal privileges and immunities,

8

means that the conspirators must be motivated by a, quote,

9

class-based invidiously discriminatory animus, end quote.

10

As this Court

If a group of conspirators assault someone

11

carrying a picket sign because they don't believe there

12

should be a First Amendment right to picket, they

13

certainly are guilty of a tort and they interfere with

14

that individual's exercise of constitutionally protected

15

rights, but in no sense do they deprive him of equal

16

protection or equal privileges and immunities simply

17

because they assault him and not everyone else.

18

But if the conspirators come upon a picketer and

19

assault him because he's black and they don't believe that

20

blacks should have equal First Amendment rights, then they

21

satisfy the class-based invidiously discriminatory animus

22

requirement.

23

That is not what is going on here.

Petitioners

24

do not interfere with respondents' rights because

25

respondents are women.

Petitioners do what they do

But it is not a section 1985(3) case at all, and

the reason is that section 1985(3) is not concerned simply

petitioners are perfectly nondiscriminatory,

nondiscriminating, in their opposition to abortion.

14

It is concerned with the

Respondents' answer to this argument is that

15

only women can exercise the right to an abortion, and

16

therefore petitioners' antiabortion activities have a

discriminatory impact on women.

argue, you can infer from the discriminatory impact that

doesn't hold up.

They interfere with the Indians' rights.
The impact of their conspiracy is on a

particular Indian group, but it would be quite illogical

4

to infer from that they have any animus against Indians.

5

They're opposed to fishing in the river, not Indians, even

though only Indians can fish in the river.

on pregnancy are not the same as gender discrimination,

abortion are the same as gender discrimination, because

The decision below should be reversed for an

independent reason, the reason that petitioners did not

purpose is to interfere with people from out of State

11

That confuses purpose, which is what the statute

requires in plain terms, with incidental effect, which is

insufficient under the statute.

respondents' logic, consider a typical picket line.

Under respondents' logic, you would say that the

an inaccurate statement of their purpose, just as it is an

22

inaccurate statement of petitioners' purpose to say that

silly -- his word, silly --to argue that the petitioners

2

care whether the people come from out of State or not.

3

But if the people don't -- if the petitioners don't care

4

whether the people are from out of State or not, you

5

cannot say that their purpose is to keep out of Staters

from obtaining access to the abortion clinic.

This Court's decisions on the right to travel

recognize this distinction.

MS. ELLIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Like the black students in Little Rock in 1957

19

who faced angry mobs as they walked up to the entrance of

20

integrated schools, the women in this case, many of whom

21

came from other States to Falls Church, Virginia, faced

22

angry, intimidating mobs who physically obstructed their

23

freedom of movement, blocking streets, parking lots,

24

entrances, and exits.

This case presents the Court with an issue that

Section 1985(3) was enacted, as Representative

acquired political rights of the freedmen.

section 1985(3) jurisprudence has strived both to give

Far from being mere torts, the acts of

petitioners here are part of a nationwide systematic

conspiracy to use force to deny women in America the equal

sought to prevent in enacting section 1985(3).

Okay, assuming that this Court has

then I do believe that blocking people from an activity

20

that only that group can engage in does suffice to prove

21

class-based animus, especially when the right they seek to

22

block is a constitutional right of a class, an important

23

constitutional right that only that class has, and

24

especially as in this case, when this Court recently

1

is necessary in order for that class to be equal citizens.

2

In this case, the two elements of the

3

conspiracy -- of section 1985(3) are not at issue, the

4

conspiracy and the act in furtherance of the conspiracy.

5

Although there's no dispute about those elements, I would

6

like to note that the mob characteristics of this case are

7

particularly important.

8

called the Ku Klux Klan Act, because it understood that

9

mobs could deprive individuals of rights in a way that

10

Congress enacted section 1985(3),

single -- single individuals cannot.
The petitioners here, who operate systematically

11
12

in large groups nationwide, are a much closer analog to

13

the Ku Klux Klan than the two conspirators that this Court

14

recognized could violate section 1985(3) in Griffin, for

15

example.

16

Because there's no dispute about the conspiracy

17

in the act, I will focus on the other two elements, that

18

the conspiracy be motivated by class-based animus, and

19

here, that the independent right, the right to travel, be

20

violated.

21

To begin with class-based animus, we must first

22

show that women are a protected class, and indeed, neither

23

the petitioners nor the Solicitor General dispute that

24

women are a class under 1985(3).

Instead, petitioners and the Government argue

deny to the class a right that is available to all, but

2

class-based animus, as I was saying before, because a

right blocked here has been judicially recognized to be

indispensable for the equality of the class.

protection of the law means anything, it must encompass

6

knowing behavior to take away a liberty right that only

the protected class has.
In Casey, this Court recognized that abortion is

reproductive lives in order to be equal and autonomous

citizens.

believe that if a class has --if there's a constitutional

equal protection to take away that right.
Now, of course, in the fishing hypothetical, the

constitutional right that the joint opinion in Casey

recognized is crucial for women to be equal and autonomous

QUESTION:

The Solicitor General relies on Geduldig to
argue that no class-based animus exists.

Geduldig was

10

decided in 1974 when this Court's gender-based equal

11

protection standard was still evolving.

12

Geduldig differs dramatically from this case,

13

because there the Court was asked to interpret the

14

Constitution to provide mandatory benefits.

15

As recognized by Chief Justice Rehnquist in the

16

1977 Nashville Gas Company v. Satty decision, Geduldig by

17

its own terms is limited to cases dealing with the

18

distribution of benefits, not the imposition of burdens.

19

Here, women are asking for statutory protection

20

from the complete denial of their rights, and they are not

21

seeking any monetary or other benefits.

22

As this Court recently reaffirmed in Casey, the

23

denial of womens' reproductive rights denies women the

24

ability to control their destiny.

Griffin is the only other case where this Court

4
5

has addressed the right to travel under section 1985(3).

6

The facts here track the unanimous decision of Griffin in

7

three important ways, and in one way this case is much

8

stronger than Griffin.

9

First, in both cases the defendants physically

11

in Griffin, there was a single episode of obstruction of

travel on a public highway.

10 miles from the D.C. and Maryland borders.

The court below found that petitioners engaged

15
16

in the conspiracy, as Justice Stevens noted before, for

17

the purpose, either directly or indirectly, of depriving

18

women of the right to travel.
Second, in Griffin the Court remanded to

21

travel.

22

that a substantial number of respondents, in fact, engaged

23

in interstate travel.

QUESTION:

So they asked for an expansive

interpretation of the statute.

16

MS. ELLIS:

They did, Your Honor.

In Griffin it was civil rights

So this case tracks Griffin in the three ways of

5

physical obstruction, actual interstate travel, and the

6

fact that in both cases the people were traveling in order

7

to exercise other constitutional rights.
Significantly, however, this case is stronger

8

9

than Griffin because in Griffin there were only two

10

conspirators, and here there was a mob.

11

mentioned before, Congress was particularly concerned, in

12

way that a sole person cannot.

We believe that there are strong reasons that

11

was created by this Court in Griffin out of concern for

12

not Federalizing section 1985(3) into a tort law.

13

Those same concerns do not exist with the

14

hindrance claim, and we would say that this is more like

15

Kush v. Rutledge, the case where this Court found no

16

requirement of class-based animus for section 1985(2), and

in Kush this Court also emphasized that in Griffin the

QUESTION:

Well, there may be evidence in the

5

record to support a finding, but the finding hasn't been

made.

7

MS. ELLIS:

Well, Your Honor, in footnote 4 of

8

the district court's opinion, the court talked about how

9

the activities of petitioners overwhelmed the Falls Church

10

police department and talked about a specific example.
QUESTION:

11

That's the effect.

There's no

12

difference between purpose and effect.

I mean, that's a

13

common theme throughout your argument.

The footnote

14

you're referring to said that the effect was to overwhelm,

requires that it be the purpose, doesn't it?

QUESTION:

Just to clarify one thing in my own

10

mind, was the injunction entered here as a preliminary

12

MS. ELLIS:

I'm sure that's true, but I don't see

4

how you avoid that without importing into the hindrance

6

have imported into the other clause.

7

MS. ELLIS:

I think the best way to avoid that

is to require that you be hindering the police for the

purpose of interfering with Federal constitutional rights,

REBUTTAL REARGUMENT OF JAY ALAN SEKULOW

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

3

MR. SEKULOW:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

Briefly, first, reliance on Kush v. Rutledge with regard

5

to the hindrance claim is misplaced because the

6

legislation requires, under the prevent and hinder clause,

7

the same word equal.

8

to be added.

9

the animus language derived from, and that clearly has to

10
11

The amendment process required equal

The word equal, in the statute, was where

be here.
I understand they're now trying to pull away

12

from their previous admission on that point, but Kush v.

13

Rutledge certainly doesn't point to that.

14

Justice Stevens, in finding the claim could proceed under

15

1985(2) there noted that, specifically, the same language

16

in 85(2) was not present in 85(3).

17

In fact,

Secondly, the defendants or the petitioners'

18

hearts were read, if you will, by the district court here,

19

what their purpose was.

20

court found it is undisputable that all defendants share a

21

deep commitment to the goals of stopping the practice of

22

abortion and reversing its legalization.

23

The court stated -- the district

There is no animus against the class of women;

24

it is an opposition to a specific activity.

25

view animus in the way respondents have would be -- using

Secondly, to

an example,

if,

in fact,

there was a disagreement or an

opposition to affirmative action by a particular group,
and that would -- if their view were to carry the day,
would have an effect on affirmative action.
But to translate that effect into an invidious
discriminatory animus, that that now means that the group
that was gaining the benefit of the affirmative action
project is now the target of their animus, would be
incorrect unless it was some type of pretext for the
objection.
For instance,
given if,

in the school example that was

in fact, desegregation -- the integration of the

school took place - - in the situation that was referred to
in Little Rock there,

it was clear that the objection --

the opposition was not to children going to school,

it was

the opposition of children going to school with black
children.

The modus -- the motive,

the animus in that

case clearly was the opposition to blacks going to the
schools.
I'd also state that our position is that Satty
certainly does not support the position on
discriminatory -- invidious discrimination, because Satty
was a title 7 case.

This Court has required invidious

discriminatory animus.

The fact that it

1

has an effect on women seriously mischaracterizes the

2

nature of the dispute, and also, I think, mischaracterizes

3

the nature of the issue presented to this Court.

4

This Court, in Casey, did not state that the

5

right to abortion was essential to equality.

6

that's important here.

7

jurisprudence with regard to reproductive freedom has had

8

The fact that the -- this Court's

10

the legal equivalent of there now being an invidious

11

discriminatory animus.

12

And I think Casey, to the contrary, clearly does

13

not support the proposition that opposition to abortion

14

constitutes invidious discrimination against women.

15

First, throughout its abortion jurisprudence

16

this Court has not found the right to exist under the

17

equal protection clause, which would be the normal place

18

to find restrictions being reviewed as invidiously

19

discriminatory under the equal protection analysis.

20

That's not what this Court has chose to do.

21

Secondly, I think significantly, that the

22

Court's opinion in Casey points to the issue that

23

opposition to an activity does not constitute invidious

24

discrimination against women.

25

opinion it is stated:

Men and women of good conscience can disagree,

2

and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the

3

profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a

4

pregnancy even in its earliest stage.

5

referring to members of the Court, as individuals find

6

abortion offensive to our most basic principles of

7

morality.

8
9

Some of us,

If men and women of good conscience can
sincerely disagree over this issue, then how can

10

opposition to abortion constitute per se invidious

11

discrimination against women?

12

It cannot.

The Court also recognized in Casey,

13

specifically, that abortion is a unique act.

14

it is fraught with consequences for others, and included

15

in those others was the life or potential life of the

16

unborn child, the woman who undergoes the procedures, her

17

family, and her spouse.

18
19
20

The Court further went on in Casey to recognize
that there is, and I'm going to quote again:
As with abortion, reasonable people have

21

differences of opinion.

One view is based on such

22

reverence -- excuse me -- for the wonder of creation that

23

any pregnancy ought to be welcome and carried to full

term, no matter how difficult it will be to provide for

25

the child and ensure its well-being.

Another is that the inability to provide for the

nurture and care of the infant is cruelty to the child and

anguish to the parents.

in character.

These are intimate views with

That -- those statements from the joint opinion

6

7

in Casey clearly, unequivocally, do not support the

8

proposition that opposition to abortion is the legal

9

equivalent, per se, invidious discrimination against

10

women.

And I think, clearly, it cuts the other way.

11

this Court recognized in Casey is that the issue of

12

abortion is one of profound national debate.
