ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY KOLLIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. KOLLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
John Angus Smith was convicted of a violation of

13

title 18, United States Code, 924(c), when he possessed a

14

firearm and offered it as an item in trade for barter for

15

a small quantity of drugs.

16

he received 30 years minimum sentence, consecutive to the

17

terms he received on his other counts.

As a result of his conviction,

18

The issue today is whether the offering of a

19

firearm solely as an item of barter violates 18 United

20

States Code 924(c) for the use of a firearm during and in

21

relation to a Federal drug trafficking crime.

22

At the outset, it is important to realize that

23

this statute provides two different methods by which it

24

could be violated:

25

and in relation to the Federal drug trafficking crime; and

first, by the use of a firearm during

1

the second way is by carrying the firearm during and in

2

relation to the Federal drug trafficking crime.

3
4

John Angus Smith was only charged with the use
prong of the statute.

5

We submit that - -

6

QUESTION:

7

with carrying it.

8
9

I guess he could have been charged

MR. KOLLIN:

That is correct, Justice.

the Government elected,

However,

for whatever reasons they chose,

10

to only charge him with the use prong.

In fact, this was

11

the third superseding indictment in regard to this matter,

12

and in each one he was only charged with the use prong.

13

So,

they had three times to change that election.
QUESTION:

14

If you had been charged with

15

carrying, I don't suppose -- and you had been -- your

16

client had been convicted,

17

here.

18

MR. KOLLIN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

I don't suppose you would be

That is probably correct, Justice.
You wouldn't have much of a case

about coverage, would you?
MR. KOLLIN:

That is probably true, but the

22

Government did choose to and elected to charge him with

23

use, and that is the reason why we're here today and what

24

he is charged with.

25

QUESTION:

You wouldn't argue that use or carry

MR. KOLLIN:

MR. KOLLIN:

QUESTION:

MR. KOLLIN:

Well -Really?

I'm surprised.

-- Justice Scalia -Well, that's all right.
-- I'm prepared to argue that, and

7
8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KOLLIN:

Yes, I think you would.
Because what I want to say here is

10

that if we accept the Government's suggestion of the

11

definition of use, this all-encompassing definition, or

12

the lower courts', then the word use would always swallow

13

up and encompass the word carry.

14

situation where someone could use a firearm under their

15

definition or under the definition of the majority of the

16

lower courts where one would not be also carrying.

17

mean, if you would carry it, you always would use it.

18

the principles - - I cannot think of a situation under

19

their definition where it could not occur.

using?

There could never be a

And

Anything you're carrying, you're

I don't know.
MR. KOLLIN:

Under their definition, it's to

23

possess with the intent to facilitate the crime, to

24

possess and the presumption of intention.

25

definition, any time that one is carrying the firearm, one

So, under their

is always using it in regard to the statute.
And the basic axiomatic rules of construction of

2

3

this Court is that we should never render a term in a

4

statute to be superfluous and that each word should be

5

given effect.

6

the word use to the definition that we have suggested

7

here, that is, to define that use means the actual use in

8

the active connotation - - according to the active

9

connotation of the word use, then the word carry would

And if we don't narrow the definition of

10

have no definition.

11

QUESTION:

I mean, we really haven't

12

accomplished a whole lot if carry means what you say it

13

means.

14

but use and carry covers everything in the world then.

Really, I mean, it may be important to this case,

15

The dispute between you and the Government is

16

that the Government says use carries everything in the

17

world, and you say, no, it's only use or carry that covers

18

everything in the world.

19

dispute is really not very important I suppose.
QUESTION:

20

So, for later cases, this

With due respect, Justice, I

21

disagree.

And the reason I would disagree is because the

22

decisions that are cited by the Government in its brief

23

and some of the decisions that I cite in our brief is that

24

there are situations that -- where somebody has a firearm

25

that is located proximally to where drugs are being held,

1

and those people have been convicted of use, people who

2

have been convicted of use who have firearms that are

3

totally inoperable,

4

have ammunition, that are located in remote locations.

5

Those people have also been convicted of use under their

6

definition and the majority of the lower courts'.

7

In fact,

that do not have firing pins, do not

in Justice White's -- in Justice

8

Thomas' dissent in Mewks v. United States, that was their

9

concern that this definition of the word use is - - becomes

10

an all-encompassing definition and it means possession and

11

presumes the intent to use.
So, not only is this important to the case of

12

13

John Angus Smith, but it is important to countless others

14

who may possess firearms and not have a use.

15

Moreover, with this definition that the

16

Government encourages here, both in the lower courts and

17

from this Court,

19

try and determine their intent, and it requires situation-

MR. KOLLIN:

QUESTION:

What do you say use means in the

It means actual use.
Okay, but to say use means actual use

doesn't help at all.

MR. KOLLIN:

1

2

Okay.

Well, it means to use it, to

brandish it, to fire it as an offensive weapon.
QUESTION:

3

Well, then you're saying that --

4

you're really putting quite a narrow construction on the

5

phrase.

6

transactions that the statute is - - don't you think of

7

them as being more consensual than involving somebody

8

sticking somebody up and getting drugs from them?

One doesn't ordinarily think of the kind of drug

MR. KOLLIN:

9

Well, also but it's an offensive

10

weapon to protect themselves or - - as a weapon in the

11

normal connotation of the way the item is used.
As an example, Mr. Chief Justice, let's say a

12

13

carpenter is carrying a hammer on his side, on his belt.

14

And an individual would go up to the carpenter and say may

15

I borrow the hammer.

16

carpenter, while he would be carrying the hammer, would

17

say no, I'm not using it now.

Am I - - are you using it?

The

You may borrow it.

Secondly, if the carpenter goes ahead and trades

18
19

that hammer for a board, similar to John Angus Smith

20

trading the gun for drugs, we would not say the carpenter

21

used the hammer under a normal way of speaking or normal

22

connotation.

We would say the carpenter traded the

You could say the carpenter used the

MR. KOLLIN:

Yes, but I don't think that's the

normal connotation of the word use.
I think similarly to this situation is the

9

uses - - is a wooly verb, its contours left undefined by

10

In that case, the Court said that the word

the statute itself, and went through its analysis.
And I think similarly the word use here has a

11
12

certain manner of uncertainty to it, and when it has this

13

manner of uncertainty and ambiguity to it, then we must

14

resort -- well, then we have the --we look to the

15

legislative history and also we can look to the rule of

16

lenity.

17

regard to this statute, I think that the legislative

18

history supports the position of the petitioner in regard

19

to this matter.

And in looking to the legislative history in

20

The original statute -- well, the --as this

21

Court has noted in the cases of Simpson and Busic, the

22

legislative history in regard to the statute was rather

23

sparse.

24

brief, the original bill in regard to adding this -- these

25

provisions of 924(c) was added on the floor by

And in this particular case, as presented in our

1

Representative Casey, and in his words, he said that

2

without the words -- word carry in it,

3

to the actual use of the firearm.

4

that it would apply

And then Representative Poff later proposed an

5

amendment, also on the floor -- and I noted in both

6

situations there was a quorum present -- that

7

Representative Poff said that his amendment to the Casey

8

proposal was not in derogation of that.

9

And so, therefore,

in conjunction with the fact

10

that the Senate proposal of Senator Dominick was not

11

accepted, which was instead of using -- instead of having

12

the words use or carry, they had the word armed, that we

13

must distinguish between use or carry, and in that

14

situation looking at this legislative history, we see that

15

the meaning of the word would not encompass the word - -

16

would go to its actual use in its normal capacity.

17

In our brief, we also present what I presented

18

as the pawn ticket hypothetical -- and that's at page 15

19

- - in which we have an individual who takes a gun and

20

several weeks before he decides to engage in any type of

21

drug activity, takes the gun and pawns it at a pawn shop.

22

Later on, he decides to become involved in - - excuse me --

23

a drug trafficking event, and then trades the pawn ticket

24

for the drugs.

25

The Government acknowledges at footnote 20 that

1

perhaps this does not fall within the normal understanding

2

of the word use, and I could submit to you that there

3

could be countless other situations like that,

4

instance, a bill of lading for gun parts that could be

5

assembled into guns that could be traded, or for instance,

6

other situations where an individual brings - - is bringing

7

home a quantity of drugs in a large box, and for some

8

reason, the door keeps swinging shut, and there is a gun

9

lying there that had no part in the transaction.

for

There

10

was no intent of being used in regard to the case, and

11

takes that gun and places it as a door stop.

12

technically under the wording of this statute,

13

being used during and in relation to the Federal drug

14

trafficking crime.

15

And
that is

So, the statute itself presents an ambiguity and

16

uncertainty as to the meaning of the word use.

17

accordingly, we have the right to look at the legislative

18

history, which I presented, and also to the rule of

19

lenity.

20

QUESTION:

And

Section 924(g) prohibits the transfer

21

of a firearm that's going to be used in drug transfer --

22

in drug trafficking.

23

someone transfers a firearm to a person, knowing that the

24

transferee is going to use it to trade drugs - - to trade

25

for drugs, there's no liability under (g).

I take it that under your view if

3

MR. KOLLIN:

To be quite truthful, Justice, I

have not explored the -- those aspects of section (g).
QUESTION:

Well, your word -- definition of the

4

word use is such that it has to be somehow used in order

5

to protect the person and not for a trade.

6

under your interpretation, the word use has to be given

7

the same definition so that if people trade firearms,

8

knowing that the firearms will be used by the transferees

9

to be traded for drugs, there's no violation of under (g).

10
11
12

13

So, I take it

It has to be.
MR. KOLLIN:
section (g)

I don't know the exact wording of

QUESTION:

It says whoever knowingly transfers a

14

firearm, knowing that such firearm will be used to commit

15

a crime of drug trafficking.

18

MR. KOLLIN:

Well, I think that the issue there

is transfer, and the later aspect is used -QUESTION:

No.

Let's assume that the transfer

19

element of my hypothetical is satisfied.

definition, there is no use of the firearm even though he

21

is -- the transferor knows that it's going to be used to

22

trade for drugs.

Under your

MR. KOLLIN:

That is correct, but it could be

under the other prong of the statute.

Well, doesn't the word carrying carry

-- strike that.

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

Doesn't the word carrying suggest

5

even more strongly than the word use in this context an

6

offensive or protective purpose?

7

a broader term than use, which is what your answer to

8

Justice Kennedy seemed to assume.

9

MR. KOLLIN:

I mean, carrying is not

Well, I think that one of the

courts have held that carrying is a very narrow - - the

lower courts have held that carry is a very narrow

definition and use has a very -- has lost its active

connotation.

transit or possess and transport.

this statute in your judgment at least, require a - - an

offensive or protective purpose when it is carried --

MR. KOLLIN:

Not under the definition that I've

suggested.
QUESTION:

20

Well, how about the definition that

21

you would like us to assume in deciding this case?

22

think carrying has no protective or offensive purpose?

23

MR. KOLLIN:

Do you

I think generally yes, Justice.

24

think generally carry does have that offensive type

purpose.

QUESTION:

1

Should we construe the statute to

2

import that requirement of an offensive or protective

3

purpose when we use - - when the statute uses the word

carry?
MR. KOLLIN:

5

I don't think that is necessary in

6

regard to reaching the decision in regards -- in this

7

case.
QUESTION:

9

Well, if we don't do that, didn't

your client carry the weapon in relation to the barter

10

that he later engaged in?

particular construction in this case, don't you lose under

12

the word carry?

MR. KOLLIN:

QUESTION:

MR. KOLLIN:

16
17

If we don't adopt that

No, Justice, because -Oh, he was discharged.

I see.

He was discharged under the use

prong.
QUESTION:

But you would lose if he had been

18

charged with carry if you adopt the broad definition that

19

you're considering.

20

MR. KOLLIN:

I think that was the same question

21

Justice White asked earlier which I agreed with, but for

22

whatever reasons, in three superseding indictments the

23

Government chose to only charge John Angus Smith with the

24

use of the firearm during and in relation to the Federal

25

drug trafficking crime.

QUESTION:

Mr. Kollin, surely a court that's

2

going to use language reasonably enough so that it

3

interprets using a gun to mean what you say it means,

4

using it in a crime, would also not be so unreasonable as

5

to interpret the phrase carry a gun to mean a longshoreman

6

who's -- who has on his shoulder a crate full of weapons

7

that he's taking off the ship.

8

reasonable for the one, don't you think we should be

9

reasonable for the other too?

10

MR. KOLLIN:

I mean, if we're

I agree, Justice, that that

11

requires that reasonableness.

12

in the footnote in the 1984 passage of the bill in which

13

they talked about a firearm merely carried during a

14

pugilistic barroom fight.

15

QUESTION:

In fact, that was suggested

You can say in some sense, of course,

16

that the longshoreman carrying this crate is carrying a

17

gun, but that's not what you mean when you say are you

18

carrying a gun.

19

arrests the person and searches and says are you carrying,

20

I mean, he's not saying are you lifting.

21

about whether you have a gun on your person with the

22

intent of using it.

23

QUESTION:

Or when the policeman in - - you know,

He's talking

Of course, I suppose the longshoreman

24

also has to be also be carrying some drugs, or the statute

25

doesn't apply.

MR. KOLLIN:

3

QUESTION:

That's true, Justice.
I was just curious about your

4

legislative history point.

5

the use by means for barter purposes constitute use, and

6

the -- you turn us to the legislative history, and

7

Congressman Casey said I mean actually use a gun.

Well,

8

actually use really isn't any different from use.

I'm not

9

sure why that clears up the ambiguity that gets you to

10

The ambiguity in using is does

look at that.

11

MR. KOLLIN:

12

QUESTION:

Well, if there is an ambiguity -Yes, and then I look at it and I see

13

actually used.

14

actually using it when I hand it to you in exchange for

15

some prohibited substances, am I not?
MR. KOLLIN:

16
17

That's got the same ambiguity.

I'm

Well, that goes to my -- to the

next point is the rule of lenity.
QUESTION:

18

Well, I know, but that -- I'm just

19

confining on the legislative --my question really is I

20

don't see why your legislative history argument advances

21

us at all.

22

started, namely, what do you mean by use.

23

It seems to me it just gets us to where we

MR. KOLLIN:

Well, I think it goes to - - well, I

24

-- perhaps my interpretation of actual use means use an

25

offensive weapon.

It's use in relation to the drug crime.

MR. KOLLIN:

QUESTION:

Well, I think that was -It's not just use per se.

It's in

MR. KOLLIN:

That was the argument that was made

in the Phelps case that was -- the decision the Ninth

they ruled upon.

2

we feel that with regard to the definition of the word

use, it presents the ambiguity.

4

We are not abandoning that position, but

Moreover, if we turn to the next point, which is

the rule of lenity, then we have -- where's there's

ambiguity exists, then you -- the decisions are that we

adopt a construction most favorable to the accused.

if we adopt that construction most favorable to the

accused, then in this situation the --we would find that

there is no violation on the part of John Angus Smith for

bartering the firearm for the drugs.

12

QUESTION:

And

Well, in our Moskal opinion, Mr.

13

Kollin, we said that a statute isn't ambiguous for

14

purposes of the rule of lenity just because it's possible

15

to articulate a more narrow construction.

MR. KOLLIN:

I understand that, but I think that

in this particular case it is ambiguous, and I think that

But aren't you saying it's ambiguous

simply because it's possible to articulate a more narrow

construction?

22

MR. KOLLIN:

No.

I'm saying it's ambiguous

23

because without narrowing the construction, we nullify the

word carry, and that the decisions of this Court have held

25

that we should never make a word superfluous in a statute,

I understand that.

You could just -- you can say that --

you can accept the fact that carrying doesn't mean use,

using it.

Not only does this definition establish the

No, Your Honor.

The word use does

not imply use for a -- for the particular purpose the item

was created for.

It implies any use.

QUESTION:

Well, that's the question in the

case, of course.
MR. HUNGAR:

Well, the definition of the word

use encompasses all uses.

If I use a gun to pound a nail

designed, but I would say in common parlance I used the

gun to pound the nail into the wall.

that we're focusing on the word use, and words are not

With respect, Your Honor -At least if you're working with the

MR. HUNGAR:

To the contrary, Your Honor.

The

12

rule of lenity is particularly inappropriate I think to

apply in this case because the conduct at issue here falls

14

within the literal definition of the words use, within the

15

literal meaning of the words use.

16

which we're arguing for something other than the actual

17

definition of the words use.

Congress chose

language which suggests that it didn't intend the courts

to draw fine distinctions among the various ways in which

Why didn't the Government avoid all

this ambiguity and cause this split in the circuits?

didn't you just indict him for carrying the gun in

MR. HUNGAR:

11

I don't know why he wasn't indicted

12

for carrying in this case, Your Honor, but I would point

13

out that that would not have alleviated the split in the

14

circuits because what the Ninth Circuit held in the Phelps

15

case is that - - they conceded in the Phelps case that the

16

defendant there had used the gun by trying to trade it for

17

drugs, but what they said was that that use was not in

relation to the drug trafficking crime.

on the in relation to prong which, of course, applies to

the carrying of the firearm.

MR. HUNGAR:

QUESTION:

Mr. Hungar, in subsection (d), the

your interpretation of the statute, is there a difference

MR. HUNGAR:

Under your definition in

If that

to, although I wouldn't think it would be.

QUESTION:

I cannot offhand think of a

18

difference of involved and use under your interpretation,

19

and it seems to me that under your interpretation, at

least it renders involved in in (d) superfluous.

MR. HUNGAR:

It has to be during the commission

of the crime, and it depends on what the crime charged is.

If the crime is distribution of cocaine, which occurs at

11 o'clock, I don't think he has violated the statute.

5

But even if he has -- if the charge is possession of

6

cocaine with intent to distribute it, the presence of the

gun at the scene of the cocaine would permit a jury to

infer that he is, indeed, using it in relation to the

In our view, the statutory text forecloses that

Congress specified the limitations it wanted to

6

impose on the scope of the statute.

The use or carrying

7

of a firearm must be during the commission of the

8

predicate offense, and it must be in relation to the

9

predicate offense.

Those two limitations do not include

10

the ones sought by petitioner.

So, the obvious inference

11

is that Congress did not intend to adopt petitioner's

12

version of the statute.
As I was discussing earlier, petitioner argues

that our interpretation of the statute would render the

the statute that would render a word superfluous because

if petitioner is correct that the statute applies only to

actual physical uses of firearms as an offensive weapon,

20

it's difficult to see how one can actually use a firearm

21

as an offensive weapon without also carrying it.

22

it's petitioner's interpretation of the statute that runs

23

afoul of the rule that statutes should not be construed in

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY KOLLIN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. KOLLIN:

As express words are placed in

7

statutes and have to be read in their context, like use or

8

carry, involved in, or used in, and not to make other

9

words superfluous, in these cases with use or carry or

10

involved in or used in, they are not mere iterations of

11

spanning out of different methods of commission of the

12

crimes, and we look at them in the normal parlance.

13

The bank robbery conspiracy.

Yes, I would agree

14

that that is the facilitation of the commission of the

15

crime and the person -- other persons would be guilty

16

under the concept of 18 United States Code, subsection --

17

section 2 for aiding and abetting, just as the theory was

18

tried to be made in the Busic case.

19

I do not believe that the Government has been

20

able to establish any example where someone can carry

21

without using under its definition or the definitions

22

accepted by the majority of the lower courts.

23

with regard to this definition is that it criminalizes the

24

fact that somebody may have drugs that are proximate to a

25

gun even where the guns are inoperable.

The problem

There are

1

situations where guns were at remote locations where the

2

drug transactions weren't being committed.

3

This also -- this same definition of use in this

4

statute also accomplishes the law enforcement goal because

5

it still allows law enforcement to encourage the person to

6

leave the gun at home because if he is carrying the gun on

7

his way to committing the crime, he is still guilty under

8

the statute, and therefore is the same goal and same

9

purpose of the statute.

10

And the examples in the later 1984 statute --

11

the versions talk about the methods of using it and they

12

give examples by pointing it out in regard to the bank

13

teller and individuals of that nature.
