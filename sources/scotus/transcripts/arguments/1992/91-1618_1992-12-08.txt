ORAL ARGUMENT OF N. VICTOR GOODMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

11

MR. GOODMAN:

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This Court has repeatedly recognized that state

12

redistricting bodies are best situated to identify and

13

then reconcile traditional State policies with Federal

14

constitutional and statutory requirements.

15

long held that redistricting and reapportioning

16

legislative bodies is a legislative task which the Federal

17

courts should make every effort not to preempt.

18

This Court has

The district court in this case made every

19

effort to preempt the legislative reapportionment adopted

20

by the Ohio Apportionment Board on February 18 of this

21

year, which we have referred to in these proceedings as

22

amendment D.

23

During the course of my argument this morning, I

24

plan to discuss each of the district court's intrusions

25

upon Ohio's apportionment process.

1

First, the lower court preempted Ohio's

2

redistricting efforts by improperly shifting the burden of

3

proof to the apportioning persons to justify their

4

apportionment plan under the Voting Rights Act.

5

Second, the district court found, in the face of

6

unprecedented cooperation and consultation with the

7

African American community in our State, that the

8

Apportionment Board intentionally discriminated against

9

minorities in violations of the Fifteenth Amendment.

10

And third, and only as an afterthought in the

11

course of their March 19 opinion where the district court

12

denied our application for a stay pending appeal to this

13

Court, the district court found that the appellants had

14

violated the one person-one vote rule of the Fourteenth

15

Amendment by adhering to a provision of the Ohio

16

constitution which permitted deviations from ideal

17

population of plus or minus 10 percent in the pursuit of

18

our Ohio constitution's policy of respecting county

19

boundaries.

20

We would respectfully suggest to this Court that

21

the record in this case is complete and clear and that

22

none of the findings of violations made by the district

23

court are supported in the record.

24

respectfully request this Court to remand this case to the

25

district court with instructions to enter judgment in

Accordingly, we would

favor of the Appellants.
With respect to the Voting Rights Act, we

2

3

believe that the findings and conclusions of the district

4

court are both legally and factually incorrect.

5

district court held that the apportioning persons in our

6

State were automatically forbidden to create majority-

7

minority districts in the absence of what would amount to

8

be a judicial finding of a violation of the Voting Rights

9

Act.

10

The

The district court held that the apportioning

11

board could not implement the State's policy of attempting

12

to avoid the dilution of minority voting strength in their

3

redistricting plan without first proving that the

4

plan of apportionment violated the Voting Rights Act or

5

that the plan which they adopted on February

6

violate the Voting Rights Act.

QUESTION:

8 did not

Is dilution the only issue in the

case under the Fifteenth Amendment, as you see it?
MR. GOODMAN:

Your Honor, under the Fifteenth

20

Amendment, no, because the district court in passing

21

seemed to say that because there was some political

22

gerrymandering, which they felt was racially based, that

23

there was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, I take it you concede that race

was an explicit factor in the redistricting?

MR. GOODMAN:

1

Yes, Your Honor, it was, but not

2

for an invidious purpose, and we believe this Court's

3

opinion in Carey would support the use of race, which the

4

apportioning persons did in this case.

5

QUESTION:

MR. GOODMAN:

9

Well, the -It was not for an invidious

purpose.
QUESTION:

THe usual rule is that disparate

treatment requires the State in this case or the

10

apportioning authorities to bear the burden of proof to

11

show that there was a compelling interest, does it not?

12

MR. GOODMAN:

Well, Your Honor, we believe that

13

the record shows that the use of race was not invidious

14

and was, first of all, necessary because of the housing

15

patterns of the African American community in our State.

16

QUESTION:

Well, first, let's just first of all

17

talk about the burden of proof.

18

category that's being used, is it not the usual rule in

19

other contexts that the burden of proof would be upon the

20

entity using race to come forward and to show that it was

21

lawful, legitimate, for necessary compelling State

22

interests, et cetera?

23

MR. GOODMAN:

If race is the explicit

Well, Your Honor, we believe that

24

there is a difference in the argument we make between the

placing of the burden of proof under the Voting Rights

Amendment.

QUESTION:

should be placed on you in this respect?

6

MR. GOODMAN:

We believe, Your Honor, that would

7

be correct, that we do have an obligation to show -- and

8

we believe the record clearly does show -- that the use of

9

race was not for an invidious purpose.

We believe, first

10

of all, as this Court said in Mobile, that the plan was

11

not adopted for the purpose of discriminating against the

12

African American community.

Well, would you agree that the burden

In fact, the record is clear that the Ohio

14

Chapter of the NAACP branches supported the plan before

15

this Court as it affects the minority community in its

16

entirety.

17

-- and there were only five minority -- majority-minority

18

districts created, one more than there was in the 1981

19

plan -- all the black community supported

20

the four districts in Cleveland, Ohio, or Cuyahoga County,

21

and the Ohio Conference of Branches of the NAACP supported

22

our plan throughout the state as it affected the minority

community.

Well, Your Honor, it would depend

again if it were such as this Court's decision in

effectiveness of the black community, it would be a

violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.

QUESTION:

But in this case,

But would there be a violation for

using this kind of stereotype, this kind of shorthand?
MR. GOODMAN:

I believe not, Your Honor.

I

15

believe that there must be a discriminatory intent and an

16

injury, and unless there is shown to be by the plaintiffs,

17

or the appellees in this case, a showing that the

18

apportioning persons used race for an invidious purpose

19

and that there was an injury, then these appellees could

20

not approve and support their case, and --

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Goodman, you seem to be adopting

22

the proposition that the use of race is perfectly okay so

You're saying race -- racial judgments are okay

Is that right?

I'm not saying that, Your Honor.

First of all, this is not a Croson type case.

This is not

QUESTION:

Is that the only problem?

You

No.

If, in fact, some white Democrats had

18

brought the suit claiming that this was diluting their

19

votes, then the suit might lie.

20

MR. GOODMAN:

No, Your Honor.

We believe that

21

this case is like the Carey case, although Carey I

22

recognize is a section 5 case.

23

the plurality in that case said that the purposeful use of

24

race was not per se a violation of the Fourteenth and

Thereby -- I had assumed the purpose of the Voting

10

you're suggesting is that it has the ironic effect of

11

inducing all the States to use race in drawing up their

12

districts lest they be accused of a violation of the

13

Voting Rights Act.

14

What an ironic consequence.

MR. GOODMAN:

I think, Justice Scalia, my

15

response would be that since Thornburg and the section 2

16

amendments focus on the results of a plan, that there is

17

no way that the apportioning persons in this case could

18

have drafted a plan with the housing and the location of

19

the minority community in our States without taking

20

cognizance of race.

That is a discrimination.
Yes, it is a discrimination, Your

Honor, but not for an invidious purpose.

You seem to say that any time the

purposeful discrimination.

MR. GOODMAN:

Well, Your Honor, we think that is

clearly a part of what we are arguing, that there could be

as you think you're doing it for a good purpose.

MR. GOODMAN:

No, Your Honor.

We believe that

8

on the voting rights issue, the district court shifted the

9

burden to the apportioning persons to prove that their

10

plan did not violate, but we argue that the burden was on

11

the plaintiffs in this case to bear the burden of proof to

12

show that the plan which we had adopted did, in fact,

13

cause the minority voting strength to be diluted.

14

believe, Your Honor, that in attempting to comply with the

15

Federal mandate not to adopt the plan, which does, in

16

fact, cause vote dilution, that we had to take race into

account.

QUESTION:

Do you accept the proposition that

19

you have the burden to prove that your object was to

the other side?

cause the dilution of minority voting strength, a burden

2

which they did not bear nor does the facts --do the facts

of this case warrant such a conclusion by the district

court.

QUESTION:

Which is hard to show.

Very often

6

it's the party who has to bear the burden of showing

7

dilution or of showing nondilution who's going to lose.

8

So, what you're suggesting is that you have the right

9

intentionally to use race in the drawing up of districts,

10

and the other side is going to have to bear the burden of

11

showing that that intentional use of race somehow caused a

12

dilution.

MR. GOODMAN:

14

QUESTION:

15

Well, Justice Scalia --

That would be an extraordinary

principle for us to adopt it seems to me.

16

MR. GOODMAN:

Well, I would think it would not

17

be extraordinary based upon how these apportionment plans

18

are drafted.

19

say that if we draft a plan that does dilute minority

20

voting strength, or arguably does, we're going to be in

court.

discrimination without taking race into account.

MR. GOODMAN:

No, Your Honor.

What do we

We believe that,

18

as the Solicitor would argue, that finding by the district

19

court means that there was no meeting of the third Gingles

20

precondition, and that alone -- that alone -- should cause

21

the district court's opinion to be reversed in addition to

22

the fact that what the district court would have us do is

be the amount.

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE APPELLANTS
MR. HUNGAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I'd like to begin by addressing the district
court's interpretation of section 2.
The position of the United States is this.

The

16

district court's finding of a section 2 vote dilution

17

violation should be reversed because the language and

18

purpose of section 2, as amended in 1982, and the

19

underlying logic of vote dilution claims call for a

20

threshold focus on the three preconditions set forth by

21

this Court in Gingles.

22

as applicable in the context of challenges to single­

23

member districts as they are in cases challenging the

24

inherently dilutive practice of multi-member districting.

MR. HUNGAR:

Justice O'Connor, in our view -And who has the burden of proof?
In our view, that's a very

difficult question.

government takes race into account in making decisions.

13

The Court yesterday noted probable jurisdiction in a case

It is always troubling when States or

case that white voters or any - - members of any other

20

race, other than blacks, were discriminated against by

The only claim in this case is that blacks suffered

intentional dilution of their voting power by virtue of

the State's decision to take race into account.

There is no claim in this

QUESTION:

Well, in this case there was an

12

allegation in the complaint that influence of black voters

13

was derogated.

14

The complaint certainly can't be read that way.

15

So, it's not just a dilution case, is it?

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, Justice Kennedy, with respect

16

I believe --we interpret the complaint to raise a

17

dilution claim, that is, a claim that black voters were

18

intentionally discriminated against.

19

certainly is that black voters were intentionally

20

discriminated against and that the State attempted to, in

21

some sense, minimize or reduce their voting power.

22

Whether that is referred to as an influence claim or a

23

dilution claim, that is the nature of the claim.

24

our view, that is the only claim before the Court and the

25

proper resolution of that claim is that it should be

MR. HUNGAR:

We don't believe so.

For the -- if

we're talking about intentional discrimination under the

necessarily applicable because the functions served by the

different than the functions served by section 2.

your question correctly, we believe the Gingles factors

Now, the Voting Rights Act prevents new
discriminations, as well as old discriminations.

It

doesn't say that we only have these factors to look at.
It's not a mechanical application, as the Solicitor
General would suggest.
He also suggests that unless you have 50 percent
blacks in the district, there is no potential for dilution
of their vote.

If you had a 49 percent district, for

example, which was regularly electing a black candidate,
you could split it in half and that's perfectly okay.
Now, the Voting Rights Act reaches that kind of
behavior, and we say that you cannot split blacks for
racial or partisan purposes.

You can't fragment them for

First of all, if blacks are packed, where it's very clear
that for years and years and years they've been electing a
black candidate with a very large majority -- for example,
a majority here was in the area of 75 percent.

Because of

the packing, the results of the last election were that
the majority went up to 85 percent.

That's clearly

packing under any definition in terms of the results of
what occurred.

So, you've got wasted votes in the packed

districts.

in that.

Yes, we did use race, but we had to because of

the residence of a black community in the urban areas.
