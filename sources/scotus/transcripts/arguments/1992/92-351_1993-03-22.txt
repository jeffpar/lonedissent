ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM K. MOORE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. MOORE:

10

it please the Court:

11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May

This is a civil rights action brought under 42

12

U.S.C., section 1983 by Respondents, who in this case are

13

Sammy Doe and the class that he represents, to challenge

14

the procedures utilized in the Commonwealth of Kentucky

15

for admission of mentally retarded persons to the

16

residential facilities operated by the State.

17

The record contains more than 10 years of

18

history of the State's efforts to comply with the

19

requirements established by the courts below for those

20

admissions procedures.

21

all admissions to the State's facilities were done on a

22

voluntary basis.

23

by the local community health centers who had certified to

24

the State that there were no less restrictive provisions

25

available for the mentally retarded person.

At the time the litigation began

The applications for admission were made

There was

1

nothing that was available for them in the community, and

2

the State reviewed those applications by and through a --

3

what they call a records review committee, which was a

4

group of qualified mental health professionals or mental

5

retardation professionals, to determine, in fact, whether

6

or not the individual could best be served in one of the

7

State's facilities.

8

If that committee determined that they could be

9

so served to determine which facility the person would be

10

placed in, the person was put on a waiting list, and when

11

a space became available, they were then admitted to the

12

facility on the application or signature of their

13

guardian.

14

consent for the admission, and the admission was treated

15

as voluntary.

16

released at any time upon his or her request or upon the

17

request of the guardian.

18

The guardian provided the substituted informed

The individual then had the right to be

The initial decision of the district court

19

reviewed those procedures, found that those procedures

20

were in keeping with the procedures required by the

21

Constitution except an additional procedure that the State

22

had informally adopted which permitted the parents of

23

mentally retarded children to essentially veto a decision

24

or recommendation to place the children from a facility

25

into a community setting.

17

MR. MOORE:

Yes, Your Honor.

18

In addition to the residential facilities, there

19

are also community facilities.

The record describes that

20

the community facilities were also developed by the

21

Cabinet for Human Resources, under contract with the local

22

community health agencies, to provide group home type

23

placements, placements in what they call alternate living

units, where someone could live outside of the community

community like setting.
QUESTION:

2

A more community like setting is

3

where they would have more freedom than they have in the

4

so-called facility?
MR. MOORE:

5

That's an issue which is subject to

6

debate, Your Honor.

For many of the people that are

7

subject to being admitted to the facility, their freedom

8

is -- the idea of freedom or the idea of liberty is very

9

limited.

For some of those -- the people that are in the

10

facilities, virtually any four walls will make a prison.

11

For many of the people, they have no liberty like the

12

people that are at Hazelwood who have no ability to move.

13

They're nonambulatory.

14

They're mostly severely and profoundly retarded.

15

matter of where they are placed as being more or less

16

restricted is in some sense debatable, Your Honor.

17
18

QUESTION:

Many of them are deaf, blind.
So, the

Well, why don't you just somehow get

to the heart of your case then?
MR. MOORE:

19

If Your Honor please, based upon the

20

decisions of the lower courts, the Kentucky legislature

21

adopted a whole new set of procedures for the mentally

22

retarded.

23

the needs of that group of people were, they adopted

24

what's called House bill 511, and it's printed in the

25

appendix in this matter.

After holding lengthy hearings concerning what

1

That new statute was challenged.

Two parts of

2

it were found to be unconstitutional, one dealing with the

3

standard of proof, which would be required for the

4

involuntary commitment of mentally retarded persons to the

5

State's facilities; the other provisions dealing with the

6

participation in the involuntary commitment proceedings of

7

the parents, guardians, and immediate family members of

8

the mentally retarded.

Your Honor.

MR. MOORE:

QUESTION:

19

It permits them to become parties,

It does not require that they do so.

QUESTION:

17

Didn't it

provide that they became parties or not?

13

16

Did you say participation?

But that permits them.
Permits them -And that provision was held a denial

of equal protection or due process.
MR. MOORE:
denial of both.

It was held to be both, Your Honor,

Yes, Your Honor.

The reason that the State adopted these

20

procedures, one of the primary reasons, was because the

21

courts had held that the State could no longer treat

22

admissions through this record review process and upon the

23

substituted consent of guardians as voluntary admissions.

24

The lower courts held that there could be no more

25

voluntary admissions, that all admissions to the State's

facility would have to be made utilizing the involuntary

2

admissions procedures.
We submit that that was -- that's clear error,

3
4

that that's a wrong decision.

We ask that you reverse

5

that decision, restore this case to the status of the

6

initial decision of the district court which had held that

7

those procedures were appropriate.

8

We also ask that you reverse the decisions below

9

with regard to the standard of evidence and with regard to

10

the participation of parents, family, and immediate family

11

members.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Moore, if heightened scrutiny

13

were applied, as was suggested by the plurality in that

14

Foucha case, do you think you could prevail?

MR. MOORE:

Your Honor, I think that we can and

should prevail regardless of the - QUESTION:

How would you justify it then under

any higher standard of
MR. MOORE:

Under any type of review, the issue

20

for equal protection purposes is whether or not the

21

legislature could first distinguish a group of people as a

22

class, and this Court has held that that's clearly

23

appropriate with regard to the mentally retarded.

or not the perceived benefits or detriments of any

legislation are something that's permissible for the

Furthermore, the only way that the mentally

10
11

retarded person can receive this type of service from the

12

State is to go through the involuntary commitment process.

A mentally ill person, who desires to be admitted to a

State mental hospital, does not have to be involuntarily

Does Kentucky law require the parent

of a mentally retarded child to continue to provide

MR. MOORE:

There is a Kentucky statute which

QUESTION:

4

Beyond the age of majority.

You have

to continue to support the disabled child indefinitely.
MR. MOORE:

5

You do, Your Honor.

There is a

6

statute which makes it a crime not to, and I believe that

7

I have quoted that statute.
QUESTION:

8

9

Even after the child is put in an

institution.

10

MR. MOORE:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's correct.

Now, does the Americans with

impact on what the State can do in terms of its

14

involuntary admission procedures?
MR. MOORE:

Your Honor, we believe that it does

not.

That it does?

MR. MOORE:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. MOORE:

21

That act is an act of Congress.

Does not.
Does not.
Does not, Your Honor.
It contains

22

certain legislative findings explaining why Congress found

23

it necessary to take certain actions.

that can be made under that act.

under that act in this litigation.

1

in this litigation that by adopting that act, the

2

legislature or Congress was requiring this Court to adopt

3

a heightened or strict standard of review for equal

4

protection purposes.

5

We submit that that does not apply.

With regard to the ADA and its impact upon

6

admissions to State facilities, that prohibits

7

discrimination based on the disability alone.

8

who are admitted to the State's facilities would be

9

disabled persons or have disabilities under the act all

10
11

All persons

mentally retarded persons would have.
The issue could perhaps be made on behalf of the

12

State, if it is to have any effect, that it should permit

13

the State to go ahead and admit people without following

14

through with the involuntary admission procedures, that

15

the State should be able to admit the mentally retarded

16

people, just as it admits mentally ill people voluntarily.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Did the court of appeals rely on

anything other than the Equal Protection Clause?
MR. MOORE:

The court of -- with regard to the

20

participation of parents, guardians, and immediate family

21

members, yes, Your Honor, the court of appeals said that

22

that was also a violation of due process.

23

to procedural due process or substantive due process.

24

just said due process.

Did it rely on any statutory basis?

2

No, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor, it

did not.
QUESTION:

3

May I ask a question about -- while

4

we're on the ability to appeal?

Am I correct that there's

5

a difference in the category of relatives that are

6

permitted to appeal from the preliminary hearing and those

7

that are permitted to appeal from the district court

8

determination?

9

15(3), which is on page 128 of the joint appendix, and

10

that says guardians and immediate family members shall

11

have standing to appeal any adverse decision.

One is section 15 of the House bill,

12

And then section 22, which is on page 132, says

13

appeal from the final orders of judgments of the district

14

court.

15

limited guardian, or other authorized representative.

16

That's a different class, isn't it?

It says that appeals may be taken by guardian,

It is.

Both or either or - MR. MOORE:

Your Honor, we're describing the

authorized agent with that department who can pursue their

12

legal remedies and can take action on their behalf in

13

addition to actions that their guardians could well take.

QUESTION:

Mr. Moore, I just want to be sure I

15

understand one thing.

16

wanted us to reverse the judgment insofar as it requires a

17

procedure to be implemented before there is an involuntary

18

commitment, that people should -- the guardian should be

19

able to just voluntarily commit the mentally retarded.

20

But is that issue before us at this time?

21

had a question dealing with the procedures that should be

22

followed in an involuntary commitment proceeding, rather

23

than when should there be an involuntary commitment

24

proceeding.

I understood you earlier to say you

I thought we

1

the issues that are specified in the petition for writ of

2

certiorari.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. MOORE:

Right.
We believe that the other issue is

5

an overriding issue which permeates the entire case, and

6

it was also the result of a clear error below.

7

for that reason, this Court should address that issue as

8

well under rule 24 of this Court's procedures.

9

briefed in our brief and responded to in the respondents'

10
11
12

13

And so,

It's fully

brief.
QUESTION:

And what provision is it of rule 24

that you think authorizes us to do that?
MR. MOORE:

My understanding is that if there's

14

a matter of clear error in the courts below, this Court

15

can go ahead and address that as well.

16

17
18

QUESTION:

Even if it's not presented in the

petition for certiorari?
MR. MOORE:

That's my understanding of rule 24,

19

Your Honor.

The issue is encompassed within all of the

20

other issues in the case because the mentally retarded

21

cannot avail themselves of the procedures that are

22

available to the mentally ill under the State statutes.

23

The mentally retarded do not have an opportunity to seek

:24

treatment other than by first going through this lengthy,

25

expensive, and burdensome process, and for that reason,

1

there are many that are likely or whose parents or

2

guardians are likely not to seek that type of treatment

3

that's available for them, which would and should be

4

beneficial to them.

5

QUESTION:

Your point is that some mentally ill

6

people can be committed voluntarily, but that isn't true

7

of mentally retarded.
But is there any reason for having a different

8

9

procedure for those mentally ill persons who are being

10

committed against their will?

11

to a different standard of proof than the mentally retired

12

- - retarded who are being involuntarily committed?
MR. MOORE:

13

Why should they be subject

Your Honor, the procedures that were

14

in effect in Kentucky at the time the litigation began and

15

weren't in effect until required otherwise by the court,

16

were that the guardian of a mentally ill person could, as

17

well, admit their ward on the guardian's substituted

18

consent, provided there was a review by an independent

19

physician at the facility, for treatment at a State mental

20

hospital.

21

The procedures were the same.
QUESTION:

I'm not sure that answers my

22

questions because today the procedures are different, as I

23

understand it.

MR. MOORE:

the two.

And the question I'm asking you is if you have

2

one person who's being involuntarily committed because

3

he's mentally retarded and another one because he's

4

mentally ill, what is the State's reason for apply

5

different standards of proof in those two cases.

that the issue we're called upon to decide, whether

7

there's a rational basis for that distinction?

8

MR. MOORE:

QUESTION:

10

Isn't

That's correct, Your Honor.
I don't think you've really said very

much about that issue.
MR. MOORE:

11

If Your Honor please, in the

12

Addington case, this Court held that the clear and

13

convincing standard of evidence was the appropriate

14

standard.

15

held not that Addington was a floor, but that that was the

16

appropriate standard.

17
18

It reviewed the other standards of evidence and

QUESTION:

The State of -Did the Court say that a higher

standard could not be employed by the States?

19

MR. MOORE:

It did not say that it could not,

20

but it appeared to chastise the States who had the

21

standard, and most of the States, except for Kentucky,

22

with regard to admission of mentally ill persons, has

23

reduced their standard to the clear and convincing

24

standard.

Yes.

Well, let me ask you this.

1

In general terms, is

2

mentally retardation, at least for adults -- and I guess

3

that's who we're talking about here -- easier to diagnose

4

than is mental illness?
MR. MOORE:

As a general rule, Your Honor, it

would appear that it would be easier to diagnose.

are still matters that have -QUESTION:

Would that justify a different

standard for admission?
MR. MOORE:

10

That could be a factor relied upon

11

in justifying a different standard of admission, Your

Honor.

all rejected by the court of appeals.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it

please the Court:
The argument before the Court today is twofold

6

that presents simply issues of equal protection and due

7

process.
First, in looking at the equal protection

8

argument, Kentucky would treat persons with mental
10

retardation differently from the mentally ill in the

11

involuntary commitment process without any

12

constitutionally adequate reason for the differing

13

treatment.

QUESTION:

They came here today.

What about the reason that Mr. Moore

17

gave an answer to Justice Scalia's question, that if, in

18

fact, it's easier to make a diagnosis of the mentally

1

retarded than it is of the mentally ill, that justifies a

20

difference in the burden of proof because you're less

21

likely to make a mistake with one than you are with the

22

other?

23

MS. MILLER:

Chief Justice, in response to your

24

question, we would agree that Justice Scalia presented a

25

very good question, but what's here is not the case.

MS. MILLER:

Because what Foucha was dealing

23

with is exactly what we're dealing here, a fundamental

24

interest at stake, a massive curtailment of liberty that

25

this Court had recognized as early as Humphrey v. Cady and

in Addington and O'Connor, and most recently last year in

2

the plurality opinion of Foucha.

3

So, given that we have a massive curtailment of

4

liberty at stake -- and one thing I would like to correct

5

is that we do have a liberty interest at stake here.

6

There's nothing in the record to reflect that these

QUESTION:

Clause would justify this Court's previous decisions that

say to involuntarily commit, you need to have at least a

14

clear and convincing evidence standard.

such a standard here.

QUESTION:

The State has

That's correct, and -All right.

So, what we now have to

19

try to justify, if it can be, is whether the State can

20

have a higher standard for the involuntary commitment of

21

mentally ill as opposed to those who are mentally retarded

22

and to explore whether there are, indeed, any differences

23

in those two categories of people that would justify a

24

different standard.

But when -- if the parents are

MS. MILLER:

5

Not always.

The record does not

reflect that every time that a parent comes that they are,

in fact, a guardian or that a guardian is appointed in

Now, we do not dispute a parent or a guardian or

say why they believe their adult son or daughter should be

the county attorney can appeal or the parents can appeal?

But you would take - - as I understand

Given that this is a judicial

prosecutorial role during the criminal hearing.

One thing I think that is critical, in going to

years to come up with a good reason, and under Foucha we
