GEN. RACICOT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

When he did so and when he was so

20

advised was he advised that the completion of the program

21

would require an admission of guilt?

22

GEN. RACICOT:

No, Your Honor, he was not.

He

23

did enroll in such a program but did not complete it.

24

was terminated from the program because he would not admit

25

his guilt to the offense charged.

As a result the

QUESTION:

1

Excuse me, he'll be eligible for

2

parole if he successfully completes sex offender treatment

3

if you win, you say.

4

GEN. RACICOT:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

But he can't successfully complete

6

the sex offender treatment, we are told, unless he

7

acknowledges his guilt.

8

GEN. RACICOT:

9

QUESTION:

That is true as well.

So it's a rather hollow victory,

10

isn't it?

He will be paroled if he successfully completes

11

sex offender treatment, which you acknowledge he cannot

12

possibly do.
GEN. RACICOT:

13

Well, the dynamics, Justice

14

Scalia' are in our experience that in fact inpatient sex

15

offender treatment, when it is available, through the

16

course of that there is a very high likelihood that he

will successfully complete.

QUESTION:

his guilt.

Well, which is

He cannot successfully complete

QUESTION:

Well,

He refuses to

then the answer to Justice

10

Stevens'

question is it really doesn't matter.

He's in

11

for 5 years, whether you win or lose, because he cannot

12

successfully complete his treatment.

3

QUESTION:

Well, he might change his mind.

4

QUESTION:

He might change his mind.

If you win

5

the case he might decide that I would rather get out in

6

less than 5 years and admit my guilt.

1

I don't know, I don't -- if you

2

wouldn't do that your only option then is to discontinue

all of this kind of treatment, program, and I don't know

whether the state will do that just because he won't admit

GEN. RACICOT:

QUESTION:

17

If, Justice White, the --

He would have to come around and

admit guilt under the program?

18

GEN. RACICOT:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.

So you are not arguing that the

20

state -- I thought you were arguing here that the state

21

has no right to make him admit guilt as a condition of his

22

probation.

23

you're saying is that the state cannot deprive him of the

24

opportunity to admit guilt too soon, that it has to leave

25

him in the program and wait the full 5 years and see if

Now you tell us you're not arguing that.

years.

to admit guilt as a condition of his probation?

But you acknowledge that the state can require him

GEN. RACICOT:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, that is our position.

So we're just arguing over whether it

must require him to admit guilt immediately or whether, or

7

may require him to admit it immediately or whether it must

wait 5 years for him to admit guilt.

12

GEN. RACICOT:
QUESTION:

Right?

In essence, yes.

Gee, it's a much less significant

case than I thought.
GEN. RACICOT:

One thing to keep in mind, I'm

13

hopeful that the Court will throughout the course of

14

consideration, is that the admission of guilt that was

15

sought was solely for treatment purposes and

rehabilitation purposes, and the record indicates that.

It is unequivocally clear.

position.
This Court has made it clear on a number of

3

occasions that prosecution --

4

QUESTION:

Well, but then we simply rely on the

5

proffers of good faith by the state that this information

6

will not be divulged?

7

GEN. RACICOT:

I believe there are other, there

8

are other safeguards that are, already have been announced

9

by this Court as well as by the Montana Supreme Court.

As

10

well, in our judgment there is not a reasonable likelihood

11

of future criminal prosecution in this kind of a case as a

12

result of those proscriptions as well as a result of our

13

intent to provide treatment.

14

QUESTION:

Suppose it was the policy of the

15

therapist routinely to report all admissions of crimes by

16

patients under their treatment to'the prosecutor's office.

17

Would the result of the case be different?

18

GEN. RACICOT:

No, sir, it would not.

Because

19

even with that report there is still by Montana Supreme

future prosecution.

Is that your case of State v. Thiel?

I did not read the case that way.

Do

1

you have any other Montana authority for that proposition?
GEN. RACICOT:

2

Not Montana authority, but this

3

Court in Murphy in our judgment certainly holds that any

4

future prosecution based upon uncharged acts would be

5

prohibited in this kind of a circumstance.
QUESTION:

6

So your submission to us is that

7

these statements are in effect compelled by the state at

8

least for purposes of future prosecutions, and so he has

9

an immunity from the use of these statements?
GEN. RACICOT:

10

No, we would not say that that

11

was our intent.

There certainly could be, even if there

12

was, even if it was stipulated that there is compulsion by

13

rule of this Court, and the rule of the land, the law of

14

the lahd is that they could not be used in a future

15

prosecution.
QUESTION:

16

Well, why, why didn't the state just

17

grant him immunity then for prosecution for perjury or

18

whatever it is he's worried about?
GEN. RACICOT:

19
20

Well, that's certainly something

that could have been done.

21

QUESTION:

And why didn't the state do it?

22

GEN. RACICOT:

Because the issue was not raised

23

in that context.

And frankly with the prohibition against

24

utilizing it in a future prosecution my expectation is

25

that it was not deemed necessary at that point in time,

Do you concede that he has immunity?

No, because the statement is not

Right.

I mean, my question assumed

20

that he would be immune from prosecution using evidence

21

obtained through the therapist.

22

GEN. RACICOT:

23

QUESTION:

Yes,

that is our position.

So your answer is that he would be

24

immune under those circumstances?

Yes.

I mean, you could still prosecute him for

GEN. RACICOT:

That is our understanding, Your

Honor.

7

QUESTION:

Well, the question I just asked, I

8

guess, was whether you could prosecute the defendant for

9

perjury.

I guess it's agreed, is it not, that statements

10

made to a therapist are not under oath and so there could

11

be no perjury prosecution there?

12

GEN. RACICOT:

13
14
15
16

That's correct, in the State of

Montana.
QUESTION:

So where would the possible perjury

prosecution come from?
GEN. RACICOT:

There are -- you could go back

17

and because of his denial at trial and his testimony at

18

trial charge perjury and reinstitute a prosecution based

19

on the evidence.

Oh,"I see.

QUESTION:

So under the present order even if he

takes the sex offender treatment he still can't get out in

Is that the answer?

GEN. RACICOT:

Absent the parole board's

But they do have a requirement that prior to the time

It depends on the

Now, the State of Montana has made it clear in

the Montana Code Annotated that where there's a child

professional duties that will show that the child has been

1

Annotated in reference to that area.

2

So basically that is the reason why Mr. Imlay

3

could have been under the threat of perjury because of the

4

fact that the therapist would have been able to testify in

5

reference to any statements made to him, not only the fact

6

that Mr. Imlay would have to make a statement to the

7

therapist but he would also have had to sign a contract.

MR. MILLER:

talking about statements about the prior crime?

About the prior crime?

About the prior crime.
So that he could be, he couldn't be

prosecuted for the prior crime again but he could be
prosecuted for perjury at the prior trial.
-

MR. MILLER:

Exactly.

He could, utilizing the

5

testimony he gave at trial, any statements that he would

6

make to his therapist and additional members of the

7

program could be utilized against him to charge him with

8

perjury for the statement that he made at trial.

9
20
21

QUESTION:

And you don't think that Murphy would

prevent that?
MR. MILLER:

Well, at this point I don't think

22

Murphy will prevent it because of the fact that the state,

23

as I stated earlier, has this provision in reference to

24

individuals who are participating in the sex offender

25

therapy program and that a child is the victim.

So

1

there's the exception that Montana has in its code section

2

that would provide that the therapist would be able to

3

reveal this information.

4

QUESTION:

But Murphy is a Federal

constitutional decision and that provision would

presumably have to yield to Murphy if indeed Murphy

it clearly holds that.

sure it doesn't hold it.

10

I'm sure it doesn't clearly, I'm
I don't even think it clearly

says it.
MR. MILLER:

11
12

Now I don't think

I feel that Murphy is sufficient to

address that particular issue if the exception in the code

3

section was not available.

4

section is the one that permits the State of Montana to

5

prosecute for any statements made during treatment if the

6

victim is a child, and I think that's what happened in

Drummond.

would venture to say that he would not, because he would

have waived it by way of accepting the program at the time

11

The

acceptance of responsibility, this Court also made it

2

clear that before a defendant could be compelled to accept

3

responsibility whereby he would have to make an

4

incriminating statement he should be granted immunity.

5

However, in this case with Mr. Imlay immunity

6

would not have been appropriate under the circumstances

7

because immunity is not a protection for a charge of

perjury.

9

Mr. Imlay would have been required to make an

10

program.

So by changing his statement from the original

11

ones he made at trial he would have committed perjury and

12

therefore any immunity that would be granted to a person

13

participating in the sex offender program would not be

14

applicable in his case.

15

This dilemma that Mr. Imlay was facing at the

16

time he attempted to enroll in the sex offender therapy

17

program is identical to that which the sex offender was

18

facing in Gilfillen v. State of Indiana.

19

case the court stated that where a defendant has not pled

20

guilty, but rather he ha£ been found guilty while

21

maintaining his innocence, the court cannot force him to

22

admit his guilt as a condition of probation, nor can the

admit his guilt.

Fifth Amendment right against self -incrimination, the

5

the state has a legitimate rehabilitative interest in

behavior common to sex offenders.
