ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES ROBERT GAILEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. GAILEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Government and the petitioner now agree that

12

a former, fugitive from sentencing does not, automatically

13

forfeit his right to challenge his conviction on appeal.

14

The only issue left for this Court to decide is whether

15

the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit abused its

16

discretion in denying petitioner his access to appeal.

17

We say it did, for three reasons:

18

was no prejudice --

19

QUESTION:

one, there

Well -- Mr. Gailey -- let me find out

20

about what you and the Government - - you say - - agree to

21

here.

22

be forfeited if there is a case-by-case analysis, so to

23

speak?

24
25

You -- you both agree that the right to appeal may

MR. GAILEY:

Yes, Your Honor, we do agree that

undertaking a case-by-case analysis, in the proper case,

1

may result in a dismissal of an appeal.

2

the court's inherent powers to regulate its own affairs.

3

This is through

We do not believe that the -- the automatic

4

rule, as the Eleventh Circuit employs, is a proper

5

exercise of those supervisory powers, and consequently, in

&

this case it was an abuse of discretion not to have

7

allowed the appeal to go forward.

8

The three reasons why we believe --

9

QUESTION:

While you are there, what if that

10

automatic rule would be bad; but a lesser automatic rule

11

would have been okay, an automatic rule involving fewer

12

situations would have been okay -- and this situation

13

comes within that lesser category?

14

situation then?

15

MR. GAILEY:

What would be the

I do -- I do not believe, Justice

16

Scalia, that the court, in exercising its supervisory

17

powers can have any automatic rule.

18

conferred jurisdiction upon the appellate courts to hear

19

such appeals.

Congress has

The court, in exercising its supervisory

20
21

powers -- that is, powers that are necessary for the

22

courts to function -- have, from time to time -- and

23

including cases in front of this Court -

24

appeals.

25

So it is the petitioner's -QUESTION:

precedent -- precedential decisions, then, can't say, you

2

know, whenever fact A, B, and C is present, you lose.

3

can't do that?

4

everything we do is governed by precedent.

That's just ordinary precedent.

MR. GAILEY:

5

You

I thought

Your Honor, that is ordinary

6

precedent.

7

approach to the problem, though, is that Congress has

8

conferred the jurisdiction -- not the courts.

9

cannot limit their own jurisdiction but for an exercise of

10

The problem that petitioner has with that

The courts

these inherent powers that the courts have.
QUESTION:

11

They have to reinvent the wheel every

12

time a case comes -- I mean, the judge can't say, gee, we

13

had a case just like this 2 weeks ago, and there we held

14

factors A, B, and C being present, you're out.

15

have to rethink it again this time.

16

They really have to do that?

17

MR. GAILEY:

But we

Yes, and the reason why is that

18

Congress conferred the jurisdiction.

19

it -- as this Court, faced with a Texas legislative

20

decision in Estelle v. Dorrough, where the Texas

21

legislature limited the legislatively granted right to

22

appeal.

23

Congress can limit

We do believe that the discretionary analysis in

24

this case was abused for three reasons.

25

reasons are ones that historically courts have looked at

And these three

1

in order to determine whether or not, in its discretion,

2

and in the exercises of its supervisory powers, a court

3

ought to decline to hear an appeal.

4

Those three grounds are:

no

5

prejudice -- prejudice in the appellate court; prejudiced

6

into potential post-appellate proceedings; and the

7

vindication of the court's authority.
In this case, under the analysis of all three of

8

9
10

those factors, it would have been an abuse of discretion
not to have gone forward with the appeal.
So on factor number one -- prejudice to the

11

12

appellate court -- there was none.

14

This issue on

Is it a flat rule that someone who

15

absconds while his appeal is pending has - - deserves to

16

have his appeal dismissed?
MR. GAILEY:

17

If someone absconds while his

18

appeal is pending, as this Court reasoned in a line of

19

cases beginning with Smith --

20

QUESTION:

21

isn't it?

MR. GAILEY:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, but the -Well, that isn't -- that is nothing

always -- when they made the determination, they did not

2

exercise it in an automatic fashion.

3

looked at fugitives during an appeal pending, and

4

expressed concerns about -- ah --

5

QUESTION:

This Court, while it

We thought there was -- apparently we

6

thought there was a class of cases where the -- where you

7

could dispense with case-by-case analysis, because you

8

would always come out the same way.

9

MR. GAILEY:

This Court never -- well -- this

10

Court, nevertheless, undertook such analysis.

11

matter of fact, Your Honor --

MR. GAILEY:

And, as a

Well, for a class of cases.
I'm sorry?
For a class of cases, I suppose.
The class being fugitive -Or was that just for the -- was that

just for the case that we had before us?
MR. GAILEY:

The class that Your Honor is

19

referring to is the case where the fugitives are pending

20

appeal -- out, pending appeal.

21

The Court has ruled on cases where fugitives

22

have been fugitives at the time appeal was pending.

23

However, in those cases, the Court was reversing a

24

favorable result at the court of appeals level.

25

Nevertheless, the Court did not take the

1

position that automatically, because the fugitive had left

2

during the appeal pending, that the court was divested of

3

jurisdiction in some fashion.

4

Rather, the Court looked at the individual case,

5

and made a determination whether or not in this Court's

6

powers, it ought to decline to hear the appeal.

7

QUESTION:

I don't think you should lump

8

together, Mr. Gailey, the cases we've had from State

9

courts involving this, and the cases from Federal courts.

10

Because our only authority over State courts is the

11

Constitution.

12

part -- on the congressional grant of the right of appeal.

13

Whereas, here you're relying -- at least in

MR. GAILEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And I

14

did not mean to lump those two things together.

15

What I was merely trying to

16

illustrate -- inarticulately though it may have

17

been - - was that this Court even when the court declined

18

to hear an appeal, it did not set down an automatic rule.

19

Rather, it -- it made reference to the fact that it had

20

the authority not to hear the appeal, but did not say that

21

it was divested somehow of jurisdiction because the

22

appeal -- because the petitioner was a fugitive.

23

In addition, in this particular case --

QUESTION:

25

Well, suppose that in this case, your

client had absconded and was absent for 3 years during

1

which time an appeal had been pending and was dismissed.

2

Could you argue that the dismissal was invalid

3

at that point?

4

MR. GAILEY:

Possibly, although obviously, as

5

Your Honor points out, the longer and more protracted the

6

period of fugitivity, the more likely it will be that the

7

very nature of the fugitivity during the appellate process

8

has some way compromised the appellate court's ability to

9

deal with the appeal.
However, it is still in the court's -- it is

10
11

still a discretionary, rather than a mandatory, reflexive

12

application of a rule.

13

would suggest to the Court, that because the issue is

14

strictly and solely sufficiency of the evidence, and

15

because the record has already been prepared and the

16

briefs are already filed, that even a period of fugitivity

17

for 3 years might not necessarily result in an automatic

18

dismissal.

19

Because in this particular case, I

At that point, Your Honor, I believe that the

20

third issue that courts look at -- vindication of the

21

court's authority -- would largely come into play.

22

this Court has consistently -- or at least consistently

23

when the petitioner was the -- the criminal

24

defendant -- has consistently denied that kind of relief.

25

In this case, the appeal -- the record has been

And

1

prepared, the brief has been filed.

The only issue in the

2

case is sufficiency of the evidence.

3

merits of the appeal are not just abstract.

4

similarly situated codefendant has had his conviction

And, moreover, the
Rather, a

.The defendant in this case received a 15-year

6

sentence on the same case for which the court of appeals

8

for the similarly situated codefendant reversed the

9

conviction.
QUESTION:

10

Are you suggesting that one factor

11

that must be considered is the likelihood of success on

12

appeal?

13

MR. GAILEY:

That is one of the factors, Your

14

Honor, that has been considered in the past in evaluating

15

whether or not a court ought to dismiss an appeal.

16

is one of the factors.

17

QUESTION:

That

Ah -- That really doesn't make a lot

18

of sense, does it?

19

appeal, you're saying you're not entitled to the judgment

20

of the court on the merits of your case because you have,

21

in some way, defaulted or waived.

22

I mean if you're going to dismiss an

And so to take into account whether or not you

23

would have had much of a go at it, had you not defaulted,

24

it seems inconsistent.

part of the court, and not a woodenly applied,

we're going to do it.

MR. GAILEY:

That's correct.
How does it fit there?
Well,

in a case where the case has

for a minute.

MR. GAILEY:

QUESTION:

Okay.
I assume that -- that -- that the

consequence of your proposition that each case has to be

decided on its own facts is that there is no such thing as

an abuse of discretion, right?

dismissing or not dismissing because of the fugitiveness.

What basis would you have to reverse?

I -- I guess -- I guess a

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

And

1

you're telling us there are no general principles.
MR. GAILEY:

2

I believe that in a case where the

3

court exercises its discretion not to hear an appeal,

4

that is always subject to an abuse-of-discretion analysis.

5

QUESTION:

Well, how could you possibly abuse

6

discretion that is not subject to any general rules?

7

say that no general rules exist.
MR. GAILEY:

8
9
10

that

You

The general rules that exist are

that the right to appeal is fundamental, especially in a
criminal case.
The other proposition is that in spite of the

11

12

right to appeal, which is a congressionally conferred

13

right, that the court,

powers,

15

of cases where there has been some fugitivity.

16

It is impossible to set down a brightline rule

17

to say that if a defendant is gone more than X-number of

18

days or months, that there is going to be some sort of

prejudice presumed.

20

fugitivity of less than that might well militate against

21

going forward with the appeal.

22

If,

Because in some cases, a period of

for example, witnesses have died, or their

memories have dimmed - - or things of that sort - - and the

relief being sought would require a retrial -- in those

1

well determine not to go forward with the appeal.
Nevertheless, there's a whole other class of

2

3

cases where a period of fugitivity might be even longer,

4

where there is no good reason for the court to exercise

its discretion and limit its jurisdiction in that way.
QUESTION:

6

You mean there's no - - there's

7

no - - there's no good reason for it deciding not to hear

the appeal.

MR. GAILEY:

9
10

Not it isn't limiting its jurisdiction.
That's -- well, that's correct, not

to hear the appeal.
In this case, with reference to the second prong

11
12

about appellate post -- potential postappellate

13

proceedings, the only issue is sufficiency of the

evidence.

That's correct.

- - is - - that other courts

have looked at, is the vindication of the court's

In this case, the petitioner has been prosecuted

by the Government, convicted, and sentenced by the

13

district court for violations of contempt of court, as

14

well as Bond Reform Act violations.

15

to a period of 21 years -- or 21 months' incarceration for

committing that violation.

He has been sentenced

Consequently, the authority of the district

court has been vindicated by the petitioner's period of

19

fugitivity.

20

QUESTION:

Well, you could always say that.

You

21

know -- if someone coming back after 20 years -- if they

22

get a sentence for absconding as well.

23

That's correct.

of the factors that courts have looked at, and only one of

QUESTION:

1

But you say that factor is satisfied

by the appealing defendant in every case where he is

3

sentenced for his offense of bail jumping -- or whatever

4

it was.
MR. GAILEY:

5

Not necessarily in every case, but

6

certainly in a case where the period of fugitivity begins

7

before the appellate process starts off, and he has not

8

been a fugitive, and has been available to accept the

9

consequences of an adverse ruling at the court of appeals.

similar rule in the Thomas v. Arn case where you had an

expression by Congress of a limitation of the right to

The Court went to great lengths to ascertain and

to conclude that it was not an arbitrary rule; that it was

not a jurisdiction rule.

looked at was the fact that in a recent case, the court

13

had declined to treat it as a waiver.

MR. GAILEY:

MR. GAILEY:

The district court judge had the

discretion, and still had jurisdiction over the case.
The argument made below was -- dealt with his

presence at the sentencing, as well as whether or not the

I wouldn't think there would be many

I suppose if -- if you take off -- if the

You'd take the position that yes, it could be dismissed on

the ground of fugitivity that occurred before the 2255

MS. WAX:

Okay, if you're asking what our

position is about dismissal of appeals from collateral

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. WAX:

Yes.
From collateral attacks -- the

14

Government's position would be -- well, first of all, the

15

question is whether the court of appeals has a rule in

16

this case that we're willing to defend, of dismissal of

17

appeals in these -- in those situations.

18

And I think our position would be that if it's a

19

true collateral attack, that the fugitivity and the

20

failure to take an appeal should be treated as an ordinary

21

default, procedural default, and that the procedural

22

default rules should apply in those cases.

23

But once again, it's not really our choice to

24

make these rules.

The question is, you know, what are the

25

rules that the courts can make that are reasonable; that

found guilty, say they sent the case to a probation

10

officer for a presentencing report, and set the sentencing

11

date 6 weeks later, after which the normal appeal process

12

had run; and if he had fled during that 6-week period and

13

been recaptured before sentencing -- on those facts, could

14

they dismiss the appeal then?

Now, as I stated, a supervisory -- a rule

12

formulated by a court of appeals in its supervisory

13

capacity is valid, as long as that rule does not conflict

14

with the Constitution, a statute, or rules of procedure,

15

is one that can properly be established through

16

adjudication, and is reasonable in light of the concerns

17

it is designed to address.

18

And I would just - - as a respect to the

19

authority to establish these rules through adjudication, I

20

would just like to point out that that authority is

expressly conferred

deal with.

And this brings up another point that

He makes the argument that if a rule is

mandatory -- if a rule adopted by the court of appeals in

the exercise of its supervisory power is a general rule, a

7

blanket rule to which it decides to make no exceptions,

8

that means that the court is somehow abridging its

9

jurisdiction.

And we would submit that that is absolute

10

nonsense.

11

be that every time a court - - through formulating local

12

rules, or this Court through formulating Rules of

13

Appellate Procedure -- makes a general rule, it's somehow

14

amending Section 1291, which is clearly untrue.

15

Because the consequence of that argument would

A court may choose to exercise its dismissal

jurisdiction over those particular types of cases.

fact that an individual is fugitive, does not strip the

So the issue of lacking jurisdiction is
just -- it's a straw man in this case.

The reasons that the Court - - this Court and
