ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. JOHNSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. JOHNSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the Eighth

12

Amendment and specifically the Excessive Fines Clause

13

applies to the concept of - - applies to the civil

14

forfeiture under 21 U.S.C., section 881(a)(4) and (a)(7).

Mr. Richard Lyle Austin is the owner of the

Garretson Body Shop and also the 1972 mobile home that

were seized by the Government under the - - these

appropriate statutes.

21

subsequent search of the mobile home and body shop

22

indicated there were small amounts of cocaine, some

23

paraphernalia, and some small amounts of marijuana.

he got out of prison.

The district court granted summary judgment.

The court of appeals reluctantly affirmed indicating that

8

the technical legal distinctions regarding in personam and

9

in rem prohibited it from reaching the issue of the Eighth

10

Amendment applicability.

11

court decisions by this Court and other courts do not

12

require proportionality in the civil proceedings for the

13

forfeiture of property.

14

It also indicated that clear

I want to make three points in this oral

15

argument.

16

gain monetarily the Excessive Fines Clause should apply

17

and Eighth Amendment proportionality should apply.

18

Secondly, the in rem fiction shouldn't bar the application

19

of the excessive fines/proportionality analysis when the

20

civil forfeitures are quasi- criminal or punishment in

21

actual character.

22

in Halper and Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, those tests

23

actually show that this civil forfeiture is punishment.

for applying the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause

to civil actions and to forfeitures.

QUESTION:

I thought we rejected the application

there.
MR. JOHNSON:

You indicated that you rejected

6

the application to actions between private parties.

7

left open the possibility that when the Government is

8

involved, that the Excessive Fines Clause could also be

9

applicable.

And, in fact, you suggested in, I think, a

10

footnote quoting Halper that it might give rise to the

11

Eighth Amendment analysis when the Government stood to

12

gain punitive damages.

13

And in Justice O'Connor's concurring and

14

dissenting opinion, there was a substantial analysis of

15

the historical development of the Excessive Fines Clause

16

and the fact that fines and forfeitures are equivalent,

17

and that, in fact, the Eighth Amendment should apply to

18

civil actions.

19

Your quote in Browning v. Ferris regarding the

20

court of Vermont also indicated -- the Supreme Court of

21

Vermont also indicated that in certain circumstances you

22

felt that the Excessive Fines Clause or the Eighth

23

Amendment could be applicable.

25

In your case Harmelin v. Michigan, Justice
Scalia's footnote also indicated that it makes sense to

It's clear that under 21 U.S.C.

We cite in our brief an article from Newsweek

5

which indicates that since 1985 the Government has

6

obtained about $2.6 billion through this forfeiture

7

proceeding.

8

9

There's also a quote by the Director of the
Asset Forfeiture Branch of the Attorney General's Office.

10

It says that civil forfeiture is the goose that laid the

11

golden egg.

12

There's another quote also that we indicate from

13

a American Criminal Law Review article in which it

14

indicates that in August of 1990, the U.S. Attorney

15

General warned U.S. attorneys that the Department was far

16

short of its projected $470 million in forfeiture deposits

17

and urged them to increase the efforts in order to make

18

the budget goal during fiscal year 1990.

MR. JOHNSON:

And this was in

What does this prove?
Well, it shows I think that there

22

should be some sort of check on the Government, just as

23

Justice Scalia says it makes sense to scrutinize

24

Government actions more closely.

25

that there is a possibility for overreaching.

What it indicates is

1

2

And so, the Constitution

automatically erects a shield against it?

MR. JOHNSON:

I think that the Constitution

protects individuals from Government overreaching if that

happens, if there's a possibility of it.

QUESTION:

And there is the

Well, what do you do with a case like

Calero-Toledo which says that even an innocent owner -and no one contends, I take it, that your client is

10

innocent.

11

MR. JOHNSON:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

No.

Even an innocent owner can -- the

property can be taken under traditional forfeiture law.
MR. JOHNSON:

Calero-Toledo needs to be

Well, Calero-Toledo, the Eighth
That would be one point.

Secondly, although Calero-Toledo indicates, as

22

you said, that in rem forfeiture really shouldn't deal

23

with the guilt or innocence of the owner, in fact, it does

24

establish an innocent owner exception.

And thirdly, forfeitures at the time of Calero7

that the Government is having under 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(4)

be taken?

Even if it's only worth $100, that's vastly

11

disproportionate to his guilt.

12

means proportional to guilt.

13

MR. JOHNSON:

14

QUESTION:

I assume proportionality

Correct.

But all these in rem things at common

15

law could be imposed against a totally innocent person.

16

think -- doesn't that conclusively establish that there's

17

no proportionality requirement for in rem takings?

applied in criminal forfeiture cases in order to determine

3

QUESTION:

I mean, we're dealing here with what

could be characterized as a punitive sanction.
MR. JOHNSON:

I believe that's true, yes.

I

4

think that's an example of why it is a punitive sanction

5

because you do have the innocent owner defenses in both

6

(a) (4) and (a) (7) .

7

We are asking that the Court apply

8

proportionality analysis to someone who is not innocent

9

like Mr. Austin.

10

QUESTION:

You mean, if -- let's assume you have

11

a good, old -- the most old-fashioned old-fashioned in rem

12

forfeiture statute around.

13

used for contraband.

14

amendment to that statute that says, however, if the ship

15

belongs to an innocent person who didn't know it was being

16

used for contraband, it shall not be forfeited.

17

would convert it to no longer a classic in rem forfeiture

18

and thereafter it would be subject to a proportionality

19

requirement.

20

You forfeit the ship if it's

If Congress should enact a - - an

MR. JOHNSON:

That

I think that -- first of all, I

21

think Congress in a sense has enacted that type of law

22

under (a)(4).

23

QUESTION:

I understand, but I understood your

24

argument to be that since an innocent person gets off in

25

this one, we should impose the proportionality requirement

1

because that renders it punishment, whereas the ordinary-

2

in rem thing was not punishment.

3

MR. JOHNSON:

4

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Yes, I believe -

So, your answer to my hypothetical

5

would be yes, that if Congress got tender-hearted and

6

said, well, let's make an exception to our traditional in

7

rem forfeiture of pirate ships and we'll say if the owner

8

of the ship was innocent of the piracy, we won't forfeit

9

it.

That would convert it suddenly to a punishment, and

10

if it was just a small-time pirate, you wouldn't be able

11

to take the ship even from the pirate --

12

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, I think that would depend on

14

16

QUESTION:

-- because that would be too much

punishment.
MR. JOHNSON:

It could depend on the cases.

17

guess it depends on the facts of the particular case.

18

That's what I would say.

19

QUESTION:

It seems to me it's in rem whether or

20

not you decide to let the innocent person off.

21

see how that makes a difference.

anything wrong and yet had the property seized and
forfeited, then obviously -QUESTION:

Yes.

punishment to that particular person.
QUESTION:

I wouldn't have thought so.

It might

be a confiscation, but I -- it's a little hard to call it
punishment I would think.
MR. JOHNSON:

If the person has done nothing

wrong it seems like, then it would be punishment if the
person would have their assets taken.

I guess that's what

I would say.

MR. JOHNSON:

you felt that the States obviously had the right to enact

QUESTION:

MR. JOHNSON:

QUESTION:

And yours was only 2 grams?
Only 2 grams, yes.

In your case, do you agree with the

correctness of the Government's statement that if your

amounted to $1 million?

allows that, but that never would have happened.

The statute in that -QUESTION:

I think the fee interest was

The facts of the case were that the claimant

had leased the interest to someone who then used it for
the purpose of a distillery business, and the person who
was so using it was putting it to a lawful use so long as
he kept records and paid taxes, which he failed to do.
Now, as a result of the acts of the lessee in not doing
what he was supposed to do, the property, including the
tract of land, was forfeited to the Government.
And the statute in that case was very clear that
the tract of land was to be forfeited.

It was a statute

passed by Congress I believe on July 20, 1868 and is found
at 15 Stat., page 133.

There was no indication in the

Court's -- in how the Court dealt with the case that it
thought of this as being in any way unusual.

MR. ESTRADA:

-- Distillery, which is cited in

our brief, Mr. Chief Justice.
Now, this Court has long understood the Eighth

13

Amendment with its references to bail, fines, and

14

punishments, to be directed to the criminal law function

of the Government.

16

understanding, this Court in Brown and Ferris concluded

that the word fine, as used in that amendment and as

understood by the Framers, meant a payment to a sovereign

as punishment for some offense.

20

And consistent with that

Our claim here is that civil in rem forfeitures

are not fines under the Eighth Amendment and do not

MR. ESTRADA:

I think Halper indicates that

3

there are certain cases in which the Court will disregard

4

the label that Congress has chosen to put on a given

5

exaction, but under certain very limited circumstances.

6

Both Halper and the case of Bell v. Wolfish, which is

7

cited, do what is in essence an as-applied challenge to a

8

specific Government conduct; that is, a claim that even

9

though a statute is civil in the usual case, as applied in

10

the case, it should be considered forbidden punishment.

11

But in the type of as-applied challenge, both

12

Halper and Bell concentrated on the seventh Mendoza-

13

Martinez factor, which is whether the Government conduct

14

seems excessive in relation to the nonpunitive purpose as

15

being claimed for it.

16

The theory of both cases, which was a theory

17

that won in Halper and lost in Bell v. Wolfish, was that

18

if the Government exaction in the specific case is so

19

patently out of kilter with the stated nonpunitive

20

purpose, then the court may safely infer that the true

21

purpose was something else, i.e., the desire to use the

22

sanction in the specific case, not to further the purpose

23

of the statute, but to inflict what is, in essence,

24

punishment.

you think?

5

MR. ESTRADA:

I think every case in which the

6

Government conduct is challenged can be subjected to a

7

Halper inquiry.

8

including this specific case, is of such a nature that the

9

inquiry should never be successful because since the whole

We think that this class of cases,

10

point of the in rem forfeiture statute is to make the

11

property unavailable for further unlawful use and to

12

compensate the victims of the unlawful use, it will never

13

be a case in which the specific invocation of the

14

forfeiture statute will exceed the bounds that the Court

15

outlined in Halper.

16

QUESTION:

Well, we can accept in this case, can

17

we not, Mr. Estrada, that the purpose of the forfeiture

18

statute is supplementary to the criminal laws because it

19

deters and punishes?

20

MR. ESTRADA:

I think you can certainly accept

21

that the civil forfeiture statute in this case is part of

22

a whole set of weapons, if you will, that Congress chose

23

to use for a very grave social issue, and we certainly

24

concede that it is part of the statute that certain owners

25

will be deterred from using the property in this way.

QUESTION:

Well, in the brief that the Justice

Department filed in the Parcel of Land case that we

at length from the Senate committee report indicating that

combat the drug trade.

recognize that the purpose of this law is to deter and
punish.

QUESTION:

Do you think historically the

excessive fines notion applied at all in civil cases?
MR. ESTRADA:

No.

No, and I think when the

21

Court went over the history of the excessive fines

22

language in the Eighth Amendment in the Brown and Ferris

23

case, the Court concluded that to the Framers the

24

excessive fines -- that the fines that are mentioned in

25

the Eighth Amendment were payments to the sovereign as

1

punishment for some offense because then and now fines are

2

assessed in criminal cases.

3

QUESTION:

So, the answer historically would be

4

if a fine is payable to the sovereign as a fine, if it's

5

as punishment, it doesn't make any difference that it's a

6

civil case.

7

MR. ESTRADA:

That is right, Justice White.

8

I should say that in looking at the issue of

9

whether this is, in fact, punishment in the constitutional

10

sense, there are tests that this Court has always applied,

11

most notably the Mendoza-Martinez factors.

12

very test, this Court only a few years ago ruled that a

13

very similarly worded in rem forfeiture statute was not

14

punishment under the Mendoza-Martinez factors.

15

is One Assortment of 89 Firearms, which is cited in our

16

brief, and in that case, the statute in question mandated

17

forfeiture of all firearms used or intended to be used in

18

violations of the Gun Control Act or any other criminal

19

law of the United States.

20

QUESTION:

And using that

That case

So, what if we say that we think this

21

is punishment contrary to your belief?

22

difference between saying it's an excessive fine or it's

23

cruel and unusual punishment?

25

MR. ESTRADA:

Is there any

We don't think that the

constitutional standard in that event would be

significantly different because in either case, you would

2

be looking at whether the Government exaction is extremely

3

out of kilter with what the Government is trying to do

4

with the exaction.

5

QUESTION:

So, what would be the standard under

6

the excessive fines route if we said, well, this is

7

punishment, and so the Excessive Fines Clause applies?

8

9

MR. ESTRADA:

We think that the standard would

be comparable to the standard that the Court used in

10

Harmelin, which is in the first instance to ask whether

11

the fine or the punishment is grossly disproportionate to

12

the gravity of the crime.

13
14

QUESTION:

So, you do say that the standard

would be roughly the same - -

15

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, we do, Justice White.

16

Our principal claim here is that this type of

17

conduct is not punishment, but even if it is, our

18

alternative claim is that under the Harmelin standard,

19

this conduct couldn't be found to meet the level of

20

excessiveness that would counsel setting it aside.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, historically did these

22

in rem forfeitures contain an exclusion for the property

of innocent persons?

Yes, Justice Scalia, in a very

And we would take that as

and in addition said that invoking a forfeiture under

those facts would likely be a violation of due process.

20

In addition, footnote 27 in Calero-Toledo

21

pointed out -- excuse me - - that since 1790 the Federal

22

Government has had statutes that provide for the remission

23

of forfeitures as a matter of administrative grace when

24

the owner can show that he was without intent or without

25

willful negligence, and that goes back to 1790.

that Congress' decision to include something very much

It doesn't stop -- it doesn't turn it

from remedial into punitive.
MR. ESTRADA:

Correct, because that has always

been some statutes that actually vest that type of claim

Throughout the history since 1790, there have

10

with the court and there are some statutes now where a

11

claimant can go to a court and ask that the forfeiture be

12

mitigated rather than going to an agency, but that has

always been there since 1790.

statutory right doesn't change the nature of the action.

I asked your brother, and that is, assuming we do find

that there's something punitive here and we don't classify

it as immune from review merely as a remedial forfeiture,

there seems then to be a historical basis for us not to

21

have to worry about the case of the truly innocent owner

subject to the classic historical forfeiture because that

person, based on your case from Fork Ranch, may very well

have had a defense to the forfeiture all along.

In the case of the parents whose

MR. ESTRADA:

in fact, what we think has historically justified civil

property that are so harmful and so socially undesirable

that the law must place every incentive on the owner of

affirmative steps, that no one, whether the owner knows

answer to the claim of the so-called innocent owner who

was merely negligent.

MR. ESTRADA:

QUESTION:

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes.
Yes, and we would say that as a

historical matter, that person wouldn't have that type of

things that only an owner can do and only an owner can

take care of his property and make sure that it is not

And didn't the Framers recognize

MR. ESTRADA:

10

There were two types of forfeiture

11

at early common law, Justice Kennedy.

12

so-called forfeiture of estate, which really was in

Government proved with a judgment of conviction that the

of England, that was true with reference to forfeitures

2

for felonies.
MR. ESTRADA:

3

Right, but it is not the same type

4

of forfeiture that is at issue here, Justice Kennedy.

If

5

this were a case in which the forfeiture could only be had

6

upon the conviction of a crime, we don't --we would not

7

be here because we would concede that the essence of that

8

sort of action is on the person.
What we do have here is a statute that really

9
10

doesn't need the criminal law other than to state a --

11

other than to set a standard of conduct and, taking that

12

as the standard of conduct, then says if your property has

13

been used or is intended to be used for this purpose, then

we will make sure that that harm doesn't come to pass by
