ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRYSON:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case calls on the Court to address the

10
11

dimension of the so-called Fourth Amendment Rule of

12

Standing as it applies to a drug-smuggling conspiracy.
The case comes from the Ninth Circuit on

13
14

certiorari, and began when there was a stop on the highway

15

between Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona, of a man -- Luis

16

Arciniega -- who was transporting a large quantity of

17

cocaine.

18

The traffic stop has since been found to be an

19

invalid stop, and we haven't challenged that, the validity

20

of the stop in this Court.
What happened after the stop was that about --

21

22

so far as the record reflects, about 5 minutes into the

23

stop Mr. Arciniega consented to the search of the trunk of

24

the car and the officers immediately found 560 pounds of

25

cocaine.

1

Mr. Arciniega then cooperated with the

2

investigation and that led to the arrest of each of the

3

respondents and others, and they were all charged with

4

conspiracy and various substantive counts under the drug

5

control statutes.

6

The district court found first that the stop was

7

invalid and second that each of the respondents had

8

standing to object to the stop of Arciniega's car and the

9

search of the trunk that led to the drugs, and then

10

further found that the rest of the investigation had

11

followed from those discoveries and therefore that the

12

evidence with respect to the defendants had to be

13

suppressed.

14

The court of appeals on the Government's appeal

15

affirmed in major part.

The court held with respect to

16

respondent Xavier Padilla and with respect to the two

17

Simpsons that the district court's ruling was correct,

18

relying principally on what we will call the joint venture

19

exception to the standing rule, the joint venture

20

application of the standing principle, and with respect to

21

Maria and George Padilla the court said that a remand was

22

necessary to determine whether they had standing under

23

this exception, and with respect to the remaining

24

respondent the court said that he did not have the

25

standing of this exception.

The court's rationale essentially was that

1

2

because the Simpsons "had an interest in the car and also

3

had a supervisory or control relationship with respect to

4

the conspiracy and the activities of the conspiracy on the

5

day of the stop, that they had standing, and because

6

Xavier Padilla again, like the Simpsons, had a supervisory

7

or control relationship within the conspiracy with respect

8

to the transportation, that he had standing to object to

9

the stop of the car.
QUESTION:

10
11

Mr. Bryson, the Ninth Circuit, as

you've described, went off on some notion of standing --

12

MR. BRYSON:

13

QUESTION:

That's right.
Acquired to address the privacy

14

concerns of the Fourth Amendment by virtue of the joint

15

venture.

16

focus, the briefs in the case address the new argument

17

here that well, in any event, there's standing because of

18

the property - -

If we were to think that that was not the proper

24
25

MR. BRYSON:

Well, Your Honor, I -At least, the possessory interest.
Yes.
Now, do we have to deal with that

I think you should, and here's why.

The Ninth Circuit referred to the expectation of privacy,

1

but they were clearly talking about both privacy and

2

property interests that were affected by the stop.

3

There's discussion throughout the Ninth

4

Circuit's opinion, even though they use the term

5

expectation of privacy, which isn't precisely the right

6

nomenclature, but they use that term to describe what they

7

clearly meant to say was at issue here, which was both the

8

Simpsons' ownership of the car and therefore the effect of

9

both the stop and the ensuing search on the rights, the

10

Fourth Amendment rights in general of the Simpsons, and

11

also the ownership interest.

12

QUESTION:

But Mr. Bryson, the question

13

presented in your cert petition says nothing about

14

ownership as a justification.

15

MR. BRYSON:

Well, Your Honor, we -- in our cert

16

petition, we address --we use the language that the court

17

of appeals used.

18

We probably should have specifically said property and

19

privacy interest.

20

Now, I think it is somewhat imprecise.

QUESTION:

You probably should, but you said

21

nothing about it and you relied entirely on the joint

22

venture rationale in your question.

MR. BRYSON:

2

view incorporated the interest of the Simpsons in the car

and the interest of Xavier Padilla in the cocaine, that

7

QUESTION:

I know they gave additional reasons,

but you didn't challenge one of those reasons.
MR. BRYSON:

Well, Your Honor, we challenged the

8

judgment of the court of appeals which was premised in its

9

finding that there was an expectation of privacy, as they

10
11

called it - QUESTION:

You think the question directed at

12

one part of the analysis gives you license to just

13

challenge anything about the judgment you want.

14

MR. BRYSON:

Your Honor, I think there are two

15

points to be made.

First of all, I think that the court

16

of appeals clearly meant to encompass both privacy and

17

property interests.

this Court has - -

22

reading of our petition is that we did, and what's more --

and there's a second reason.

The respondents came back and in defense of the
judgment said that there is a reason that this judgment is

2

petition should be viewed as being limited to expectation

of privacy, and that is that there were property interests

at stake here which were affected.

We think that the ownership of the car --

QUESTION:

14

MR. BRYSON:

Yes and no.
Yes.

The first -- the yes part is

that we think the ownership of the car generally gives the

1

to challenge it because it didn't hurt him right at the

2

time, is that the point?

3

MR. BRYSON:

Exactly.

It did not -- and when I

4

say hurt, what I mean is,

5

property interests in the car, because the only thing that

6

was at issue there was the interference with Arciniega's

7

right to continue down the highway.
Arciniega was in control of the car.

8

9

it did not affect any of his

affected control.

The stop

It didn't affect a proprietary interest

10

in the car, so yes, generally an owner of a car has a

11

right to object to a procedure - - to a seizure, but in

12

this case this kind of procedure did not implicate the

13

owner - -

QUESTION:

Suppose the Government had loaned --

suppose the car had been loaned for a week, and the

16

Government seized it and then kept it for only 6 days,

couldn't you say the same thing?

MR. BRYSON:

Well,

if it had been loaned for a

week -- suppose it's a rental car, to make it - -

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. BRYSON:

Right.
And the rental agreement was that

22

after 7 days it should be returned, and in fact the car

23

was returned on the seventh day - - the Government had held

24

it for 6 days in between --we would say that the effect

1

the rental company, was that their property interests in

2

the car were not affected.

3

Now, this case involves much less, of course,

4

than a 6-day seizure, but the principle is the same.

5

principle is that the interests of the owners in getting

6

their car back and in being able to enjoy the use of the

7

car during the time that they intended to use it, which

8

was when it came back, was not affected.

14

to trust Mr. Padilla with that, but they're not

15

particularly willing to trust the Government with it?

16

I mean, what if they had confidential

MR. BRYSON:

Well, if there's a privacy

17

interest, then the privacy interest is -- and they have

18

retained a privacy interest in the car, then they may well

have a basis for objecting to the search of the car but

not to the seizure.

1

all that happens is that you hold the goods and you don't

2

conduct a search at all - - in this case there was a

3

consent search, which waived, in effect, the privacy

4

interests of the Simpsons in the trunk, whatever those

5

might have been, but if all that would happen in this case

6

is that there had been a stop, and let's say Arciniega had

7

made a confession which implicated the Simpsons, then no

8

privacy interest in the car would have been implicated.

9

The car wouldn't have been held.

10

But what really is at issue with respect to the

11

Simpsons is, they have given over control, the use of the

12

car, for a period of several days to this man, and that

13

man's personal right to control the car which has been

14

ceded to him by the Simpsons is what was affected by the

15

stop, plus his personal right as an individual to travel

16

on the highway without being interfered with.

17

interference with the ultimate -- let's called a remainder

18

interest, or whatever you want to call it, in the property

19

of the Simpsons.

There is no

Now, they may have a separate privacy interest

21

which may be implicated, but if, as we submit, they have a

22

privacy interest, say in the trunk, and the district court

23

found that they did, that privacy interest could be in

24

effect waived by Arciniega's consenting to a search of the

trunk, which we think it's manifestly the case that he had

Well, Mr. Bryson, don't our cases

generally in the Fourth Amendment area say that the

privacy interest is protected against seizures and the

and the privacy interest is - - the property interest is to

protect it against seizures?

MR. BRYSON:

Yes, that's right, and here, we - -

1

based on the district court's finding that the Simpsons

2

had a privacy interest in the trunk, and the question of

3

consent is open.

4

MR. BRYSON:

I think the question of consent is

5

open, Your Honor.

They may -- if this case is remanded

6

they may say that there was an invalid consent, and if

7

they both have continuing privacy interest in the trunk,

and we had an invalid consent, then we would have a

MR. BRYSON:

Is that the best result you can hope

Well, I think that you're going to

have to remand -- assuming we win the major submission in

15

the case, you will have to remand for a disposition of the

remaining claims and ultimately for trial, and I think --

there has not been a final disposition by the court of

What difference does it make if -- to

21

the Simpsons' interest if Mr. Arciniega's consent is valid

22

1

the car -- let's -- suppose this had been a search of the

2

front seat, where the officer had stopped Arciniega and

3

just looked in the front seat and there was all the

4

cocaine, we would argue, and we would be right, that the

5

Simpsons just had no continuing privacy interest in the

6

front seat of the car.

7

So in that setting it wouldn't matter whether

8

Arciniega's consent was obtained voluntarily or

9

involuntarily, since the Simpsons would have no continuing

10

privacy rights, but the argument that the Simpsons made

11

below, and the argument that was accepted by the district

12

court, was that they continued to have a privacy interest

13

in the trunk.

MR. BRYSON:

Well, do you think -If that's true -Go ahead.
We don't think that's right, but we

do have a district court finding to that effect.

20

Now, if that's true, then the way we get the

21

evidence introduced is by showing that the consent was

22

valid on the part of Arciniega.

23

what the Matlock case indicates could be done in this

24

situation.

the consent is invalid as to Arciniega, the Simpsons get

no benefit from that.

They don't if they did not retain a

MR. BRYSON:

Do we have to look at the terms

to look at - QUESTION:

Or at the criminal enterprise, as the

Ninth Circuit suggested?
MR. BRYSON:

You would have to look at such

15

things as the terms of the bailment, you would have to

16

look at whether in the view of

19

QUESTION:

Well, how is the officer to know this

when he makes his stop?
MR. BRYSON:

Well, the officer is not going to

20

know it, and typically the officer will be in a position

21

of having apparent authority to go into the trunk, so even

22

if the person who's driving the car --

MR. BRYSON:

1

But the key here is that if there is a retained

2

privacy interest in the trunk, and the officers coerce the

3

individual into giving up his right to go into the trunk

4

and force -- in effect, they do the same thing as if they

5

had simply said, out of the way, we're going to jimmy up

6

the trunk and they open it with a crowbar, then they have

7

violated privacy interests on the part of the Simpsons.

8

Now - -

9

QUESTION:

Well, I don't understand how an

10

officer is supposed to know whether someone else has

11

retained privacy interests in the trunk.

12

your chances when you open a trunk with someone's consent?

13

MR. BRYSON:

Do you just take

If he had -- if he's in a situation

14

where it's reasonable for the officer to assume that

15

somebody who's driving a car has authority to consent to

16

the search of the trunk, then the officer's acted

17

reasonably if he obtains the consent in a valid fashion.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Is it reasonable for officers to do

that if they know someone else owns the car?
MR. BRYSON:

Typically it will be, yes, because

21

they will assume that somebody who is driving a car and is

22

in the middle of the highway has authority to go into the

23

trunk, particularly if he's been given the keys, as was

24

the case here.

QUESTION:

Why do

we have to remand?
MR. BRYSON:

Well, we think we do win if this

Court wants to make a finding with respect to the validity

of the consent.

6

the kind of thing that I would think would be made by the

determine if someone -- some third-person owner has some

retained privacy interest in the trunk.

12

MR. BRYSON:

13

QUESTION:

Well -It seems to me there's a question of

whether or not an officer acts reasonably, and whether

this is a legitimate interest that we're prepared to

recognize or not.

MR. BRYSON:

The only point I'm making, and I'm not making it

1

2

very clearly, I'm afraid, but the only point is that if

3

the officers go up there and beat a consent out of

4

Arciniega, that's not reasonable police conduct, and they

5

are therefore not entitled to the benefit of the search,

6

which may affect what turns out to be somebody else's

7

privacy interest in the trunk.

QUESTION:

MR. BRYSON:

QUESTION:

But conceding that point -Yes.
Why were you getting into the

question of the authority of the driver of the car to

consent to the opening of the trunk?

14

MR. BRYSON:

15

QUESTION:

Well, only because the -I mean, the officer, as Justice

16

Kennedy said, has to operate on reasonable assumptions.

17

He can't get a whole chain of title to the car when

18

he's

19

MR. BRYSON:

Exactly.

That's why apparent

20

authority is the question with respect to the officer's

21

perception of Arciniega's right to open the trunk.

22

If the officer looks at this man who's driving

23

down the highway and says, anybody in this situation I'm

24

going to assume has authority to go into the trunk, that's

25

a reasonable conclusion, and that's why we think we win on

the validity of the consent.
That's why we think that if this case goes back

3

to the district court we will prevail on the question of

whether this was a valid consent, because as this Court

point you wanted to have us decide was whether or not this

QUESTION:

Yes.
Notion is a valid one to give

13

standing, and to decide that, I would think we could

just --we would say, just forget about the ownership of

15

the car.

16

Suppose Padilla owned the car and the same thing

17

happened - - he consented to go in - - and the court of

18

appeals would have come out exactly the same way.

We'd say, suppose Padilla owned the car.

19

They would have said, because they were all

coconspirators, they all have an interest in the

21

transportation of cocaine and that car, they have standing

to object.

MR. BRYSON:

It talks about whether

Well, Your Honor, the merits, and

the Court's opinion in Rakas makes the point -- and we do

use the term, standing, but technically the Court has said

17

in Rakas that standing really is just a proxy for talking

18

about the merits of whether a particular individual has

had a Fourth Amendment violation of his personal rights,

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, let me go back,

if

12

to your argument that the Simpsons do not have any

13

property right that was infringed, and your argument, as I

14

understand it,

15

the owner has consented to another person's having

16

possession and the stop occurs during the period of that

17

consented possession, that there is no property interest

18

that the Simpsons or that the owners can assert.

19

is that if the Simpsons have consented, or

But it seems to me that is simply identifying

20

all ownership interests with simply possession at the

21

time, and the fact is the Simpsons have not,

22

that I can see, given away their right to control as

23

owners of the car who will have that possession, and they,

24

in effect have said you the driver can have it.

owner's consent precludes the owner, in effect, from

asserting a different ownership right.

MR. BRYSON:

Well, I think that the owner could

decide that if presented with the question -- if Arciniega

the Simpsons and say, should I let these officers take

That's right -There's no implication there that

they are consenting to or giving permission to anyone else

lose the case.
MR. NASH:

Under that hypothetical, that's

Right.

MR. NASH:

But both Mr. Padilla and Mr. and Mrs.

correct.

Simpson had a possessory or property right in both the car
and its contents.
QUESTION

Well, suppose the stop were lawful?

MR. NASH

If the initial stop were lawful --

QUESTION

And so then - -

MR. NASH

Then the issue as to the seizure of

the car would not be subject to further argument.

The

issue would then turn to - QUESTION:

Well, then it's not just a question

of seizure.
MR. NASH:

Well, the way the question is

postured to this Court, it is, because the only issue that
was ruled on in the district court and in the Ninth
Circuit was the seizure of the car, not the consent, not
the other things, except insofar as they were tainted.
There has been no hearing on the merits of that
consent, about the trunk search, or the other issues.
District Judge Billby was very clear in saying, I will not

Under Soldal, the interest that needs to be --

QUESTION:

But it seems to me, first things

lawful and the consent were lawful, then there would be no

8

MR. NASH:

Under that --

9

QUESTION:

So I question the district court's

10
11

and the Ninth Circuit's approach.
MR. NASH:

Well, we always have to begin with

12

the first level of intrusion, and the first level of

13

intrusion is almost always the stopping of the vehicle or

14

the person.

15

If, indeed, that level of intrusion is deemed to

16

be valid, we then turn to the other intrusions -- the

17

search, a subsequent seizure if, indeed, there's one after

18

the car's first stop.

23

QUESTION:

If you're right about that, Mr. Nash,

why did the Ninth Circuit reverse as to Strubbe?
I mean, they decided the case finally as to him,
didn't they?
MR. NASH:

Because what the Ninth Circuit said

24

was Mr. Strubbe had not claimed and could never show any

possessory interest in either the contraband or in the

right to privacy.
What the Ninth Circuit has said - - and I would

3
4

take issue with Government's counsel's characterization of

5

the joint venture rule, which I don't think you should

6

reach in this case, but --

7

QUESTION:

Well, the way --

8

MR. NASH:

The rule is not mere membership in a

9

joint venture, ipso facto, confers standing on a litigant.

10

What it says, simply, is that a court will quite properly

11

analyze the relationships of the parties to each other to

12

the property seized or the property or place that was

13

searched.

14

QUESTION:

That isn't what the court of appeals

15

said in its opinion, as I read it.

It apparently has a

16

well-developed doctrine of joint venture in a criminal

17

undertaking, and it referred to joint venture, and it

18

cited previous cases, so I think it's very difficult to

19

say that the Ninth Circuit didn't decide the case on that

20

ground.
Perhaps it should have decided it on another

21
22

ground, and perhaps the two are interrelated, but the

23

Ninth Circuit opinion just abounds with the words, joint

24

venture.

It does, and let me suggest to the

The Ninth Circuit does talk about right to

that case was the right to privacy.

concerned - -

3

MR. NASH:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Whether membership in a joint venture

Your opposition to the petition for certiorari

case.
MR. NASH:

11

It does two things.

Number 1, the

briefs of counsel do very definitely say this is a

13

seizure, and under Soldal, which was decided just days --

14

QUESTION:

I'm not talking about the briefs of

counsel.

I'm talking about your opposition.

the argument in your opposition to the petition for

MR. NASH:

Did you make

presented is not in the case?

Not that there's another

2

issue in the case, but that this issue is not in the case,

3

which is what you're now telling is.

4

MR. NASH:

Mr. Simpson did in his opposition.

5

QUESTION:

Where did he do that?

6

MR. NASH:

His counsel has indicated to me that

7

it's found at page 10 of his pro se opposition to the

8

petition for writ of certiorari.

9

Also, I would suggest to you, Justice Scalia,

10

that if the Seventh Circuit was mistaken and confused in

11

its proper application of whether or not right-to-privacy

12

analysis applied in the seizure case, which it was, and

13

the decision there that was clarified by this Court in

14

Soldal, if they were mistaken, then both the Ninth Circuit

15

and perhaps counsel that were involved in the application

16

of that test could also have been mistaken.

17

QUESTION:

Would you show me where on page 10?

18

I have page 10, and I don't see anything that says the

19

issue is not in the case.

but I don't see it.

Maybe I have the wrong page 10,

21

I mean, it's an important issue.

MR. NASH:

MR. NASH:

paragraph beginning at line 24,

"In addition to

erroneously overlooking the important difference between

QUESTION:

Yes.

8

MR. NASH:

That is the square issue that we're

talking about.
QUESTION:

10

No, no.

The issue I'm talking about

11

is a contention which you have made, not that there is an

additional issue, but that this issue is not in the case,

13

that the issue on which we granted certiorari is not in

That's what you've told us.

You've said that

MR. NASH:

If this is a seizure case --

QUESTION:

Would you show me where that appears

18

in anybody's brief, or otherwise say, as far as you know,

19

it does not appear in anybody's opposition?
MR. NASH:

20

To say that, in the opposition of Mr

21

Simpson to the petition for writ of certiorari, that the

22

Government overlooks the difference between a seizure

23

which doesn't involve a right to privacy, that is the

issue.

That is the point that we are raising.

Further -

QUESTION:

That's a quite different point.

2

You're saying there's an additional issue here.

There's a

difference between the joint venture issue and the

MR. NASH:

Yes.

6

QUESTION:

We understand that.

MR. NASH:

Yes.

QUESTION:

But that's not the point you were

making.

You were making the point that the joint venture

issue is not in the case.

point?

Now, do you still make that

MR. NASH:

What I am saying is that --

QUESTION:

If you could answer that yes or no,

15

MR. NASH:

Yes, sir, it is in the case.

QUESTION:

Okay, it is in the case.

17

MR. NASH:

It's raised in the case.

14

18
19

Mr. Nash.

It ought

not to be, that is my argument.
If this is in fact a seizure case, then under

20

Soldal a right-to-privacy analysis does not apply, and the

21

question that the Government sought certiorari on is what

22

role, if any, should a joint venture standing issue play

23

in determining right to privacy?

24
25

Under Soldal and under Jacobsen,, if this is a
seizure case, right-to-privacy analysis doesn't apply.

We are claiming a possessory interest or

proprietary interest in both the car and the contraband

3

under two separate theories.

4

two separate theories, one of which is car, and one is the

contents.

Number 1 -- excuse me, under

The Government's claim in this Court is that an

absent owner can never properly claim a possessory

8

interest in an automobile, and that simply has not been

9

the law in this Court or in any other.
QUESTION:

10

Assume we agree with the Government

11

that this joint enterprise theory doesn't give standing to

12

the members of the conspiracy without more?

13

would still suggest to us that we should affirm on another

ground.

Then you

MR. NASH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Namely -- but if we agree with the

Government on that, it seems to -- on their submission

about the joint enterprise, it seems to me the only people

MR. NASH:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

so the issue of ownership of the car strictly pivots

around Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, but in the district court

was he to whom the car was entrusted to transport the

QUESTION:

It

Well, let's assume that the driver of

the car owned the car, and let's assume that the consent

was valid to open the trunk.

10

Now, the possessory right to that cocaine isn't

11

going to help them very much, because it's just a plain

13

MR. NASH:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

And --

MR. NASH:

If under that hypothetical, which is

Yes.

If we assume --

QUESTION:

Why, then, isn't this a search case?

QUESTION:

When he's been invalidly stopped?

MR. NASH:

Because it was their car, sir, and

10

they also had a possessory interest in the contraband.
Clearly, if one has a possessory interest in a

11

vehicle, even though one happens to be absent at the time

of the stop, you are not deprived of your ability to

13

contest the Fourth Amendment violation.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Don't our cases say that you can't

have a legitimate possessory interest in contraband?

They do not for standing purposes.

QUESTION:

Trupiano was largely overruled by

MR. NASH:

But not squarely on that point.

loses standing to raise a possessory interest or right to

Do you have any case stronger than

what remains of Trupiano to support your position?

say the Government has nothing to support its position.

Jeffers also says the same thing.

QUESTION:

Jeffers, okay.

13

QUESTION:

Of course, you have a more difficult

14

problem, don't you, than simply --at least on behalf of

15

the Simpsons -- than simply asserting what you described

16

as a possessory interest, because you've got to - - they

would have to base their claim there on constructive

They did not, in fact, have possession of the

drugs, and it's -- I would have thought that the theory on

21

which you get constructive possession, one element of

22

which is the right to control the dominion over something,

23

the right to dispose of it, is essentially a theory of

QUESTION:

They

don't have a possessory interest in the sense of having

have is a constructive possessory interest, and if a

constructive possessory interest implies title or

The only possessory interest they can

interest that can give standing is a present possessory

11

interest as opposed to a constructive one, which is what

the Simpsons have here.

13

MR. NASH:

But possession does not require

intent to control.

another layer of constructive possession to the analysis.
MR. NASH:

2

If this Court chooses to find that

one can never, as a matter of law, have a possessory

interest in contraband, then your hypothetical is correct.
QUESTION:

5

All we have to find, it seems to me,

6

is that you may not have title or ownership in contraband,

7

and I thought that's where we were at the present time.
MR. NASH:

8

9

Well, one can possess something, my

argument is, without necessary owning it.

10

QUESTION:

Well, I agree with you.

11

MR. NASH:

The Government urges that an absentee

owner can never claim any type of proper possessory

interest, and with regard to the vehicle and with the

contraband, once we assume the correctness of my position

15

on the possession versus ownership issue, it's simply not

valid.

It was open and

obviously clear that this was a bailment.

4

MR. NASH:

That's clear, and that's --

QUESTION:

But --

6

MR. NASH:

That is exactly this case, with even

7

more control exerted over the bailee by the bailor than

8

was found in the Federal Express example.

9

QUESTION:

So are you saying that any time the

10

police stop an automobile and find that it's registered to

11

a different owner that there can be no consent given by

12

the driver?

13

MR. NASH:

Absolutely not, sir.

We are not

14

saying that Mr. Arciniega's consent, assuming, number 1

15

the validity of the initial seizure of the car, and number

16

2 assuming the, on its merits, if you will, validity of

17

the consent, is not binding on anyone else.

18

It would be.

It would be binding on everyone

19

else who claimed an ownership or possessory interest in

20

the car, but the vice of your hypothetical is that it

21

assumes two facts that are not in this case, one a finding

22

of validity of the initial seizure, number 2, some type of

23

ruling on the merits in favor of the Government in the

24

issue of consent, neither of which exist in this case.

25

But clearly, if we assume those two things, the

person who is driving the car, who is properly empowered

to drive it, can issue a consent under this Court's prior

That is not at

The point that I was making that the prior case

law of this Court clearly establishes that one may be

7

absent and still have the right to complain about a

seizure.

9

The issue of absence clearly more appropriately
Simply put, if I

10

have an interest in property and someone trespasses on

11

that property, whether or not I know about it or I am

12

present, I still have an interest that has been offended,

13

an interest that would give me a right to complain about

14

that, and it is no different when one considers standing.
The Government makes much to do in the written

15
16

briefs filed in this case concerning the issue of minimal

17

intrusion versus more than minimal intrusion.

18

Traditionally, this Court has analyzed the issue of

19

minimal intrusion versus more than minimal intrusion as to

20

the level of finding that the Government has to make, the

21

kind of showing they have to make to justify the initial

22

seizure.

23

If it is merely a minimal intrusion and

24

counterplayed against a strong prevailing Governmental

25

interest, then the kind of showing the Government has to

minimal intrusion, probable cause is required.

3

If it is more than a

What the Government seeks to do here is

4

bootstrap that argument to the next level, and what they

5

seek to do is say that in the case of a minimal intrusion

6

no articulable objective facts need be shown, not even

7

reasonable suspicion.

argument here.

That really is the thrust of their

It is important to recognize that in this case

9
10

the record is very clear and unequivocal that there was no

11

fact, no specific articulable fact, that could support the

12

initial detention of the car in this case, so the

13

Government wants to take the minimal cases to the next

14

level, which, I would submit, is simply not justified on

15

the facts of this case or any prior precedent in this

16

Court.

17

If we look at the issue of whether or not this

18

is a case limited to a seizure, then the joint venture

19

rule as it determines one's right to privacy has no place

20

in the analysis, and what the Ninth Circuit may have done

21

is the same thing that the Seventh Circuit did in Soldal.

22

It has improperly considered one's right to privacy in

23

determining the propriety of a seizure rather than a

24

search.

Soldal, as it did in the Seventh Circuit, will clear up

this issue and provide guidance to counsel and courts that

the proper measure of inquiry is not right to privacy but

is, instead, property rights.
