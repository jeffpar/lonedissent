ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. BEILEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. BEILEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

This case concerns Federal appellate

13

jurisdiction.

14

executing on a favorable currency forfeiture judgment,

15

divest a Federal appellate court of appellate jurisdiction

16

to decide the merits of a timely filed appeal.

17

Eleventh Circuit below held that the Government had this

18

power, which holding is contrary to the majority of the

19

circuit courts of appeals which have addressed this very

20

issue.

21

The issue is can the United States, by

The

It is the Government's position in this case

22

that the Government can bring a civil forfeiture lawsuit,

23

win the case at trial, and then prevent an appellate court

24

from deciding the merits of that appeal by transferring

25

the funds in dispute from the territorial jurisdiction of

the trial.
QUESTION:

I suppose, would its position also be

3

that if pending the, pending the decision of the district

4

court the property was sold and the proceeds were

5

transferred to some other place the district court would

6

lose jurisdiction too,

7

MR. BEILEY:

I suppose?
I believe that would follow from

8

the Government's position.

9

position that we advocate before this Court.

10

Thac's certainly not the

The late Judge Vance in his dissent in the

11

Eleventh Circuit's One Lear Jet case, which dissent is now

12

the basis for the rule in the majority of the circuits,

13

referred to the majority opinion which adopted the

14

Government's arguments being made before this Court as

15

follows, and I quote.

16

of fairness,

17

and it is analytically flawed.

18

comments are correct.

19

It offends fundamental principles

it represents a departure from common sense,
We believe Judge Vance's

It is the bank's position in this case that the

20

Government should not have the power to defeat a Federal

21

court's appellate jurisdiction by its unilateral act of

22

levying on a forfeiture judgment.

23

the Government or any party brings a lawsuit in Federal

24

court that party, as the plaintiff,

1

of the underlying action.
The bank further submits that the nature of the

2

3

trial court proceeding, whether you call that proceeding

4

in rem, quasi in rent, or in personam, should have no

5

bearing on the issue of Federal appellate jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

6

Well, this would be your view even in

7

a classical admiralty action, Mr. Beiley, where everybody

8

agrees it is a prototypical in rem action, nonetheless the

9

Government there would submit itself to the personal

10

jurisdiction of the court?
MR. BEILEY:

11

It's not only my position, Your

12

Honor, but it has been adopted by this Court in several of

13

the cases cited in our brief in a pure admiralty case, the

14

Feckler case, the British transport case, and several

15

prize cases where the Government has intervened in

16

admiralty in rem cases and then objected to cross claims

17

being filed against it.

18

the United States intervenes it takes the position of a

19

private suitor for all purposes for which justice may be

20

done.

21

23

QUESTION:

And this Court had held that when

Well, is that the same thing though

as an admiralty action say initiated by the Government?
MR. BEILEY:

Our position would be it would be

24

the same, Your Honor, that the Government by initiating an

25

action, as well as any plaintiff that initiates an action,

submits itself to the court's in personam jurisdiction.

2

QUESTION:

MR. BEILEY:

Notwithstanding sovereign immunity?
That is correct, Your Honor.

Sovereign immunity we believe would apply to suits against

the Government, not to suits by the Government.

Government initiating a lawsuit.

QUESTION:

In your

So that our position

Well, Mr. Beiley, what about cases

10

like the Brig Ann where the court has stated that the

11

release of the res ends jurisdiction?

12

MR. BEILEY:

Justice O'Connor, first, we don't

13

believe that ancient admiralty cases should be relevant to

14

an issue of Federal appellate jurisdiction in a currency

15

forfeiture suit.

16

cases, our reading of the cases, I recognize the

17

Government has a contrary interpretation.

18

the traditional old admiralty cases, which we don't

19

believe to be relevant, is that jurisdiction vests upon

20

the initial seizure and that the continuous seizure or the

21

continuous court control of the res, even in the old

22

admiralty cases, is only required in two circumstances,

23

none of which apply here.

24

But even under those old admiralty

absconds with the res, what happens then?

MR. BEILEY:

1

In a traditional admiralty case if

2

the only way that the court can fashion meaningful relief

3

to the litigants is to have custody of the res and it's

4

essential that that res be before the court to make a

5

meaningful award, then you have this useless judgment

6

exception, as we referred to it in the rules, and the

7

court will not entertain a suit where it can't fashion any

8

meaningful relief.

9

Government has the money.

But that's not the case here.
The Government has had

10

possession of the money from the time this lawsuit

11

started.

So we don't believe -QUESTION:

12

The

Mr. Beiley, you would say that even

3

in the old admiralty cases, I think you would say this,

4

that if the case had already been decided by the district

5

court and was on appeal, as it is here, and at that point

6

somebody absconded with the ship, the appeal would have

7

proceeded, even in old admiralty cases.

8

that?

9

Wouldn't you say

Do we have a case where that was the situation?
MR. BEILEY:

Our position would be if the

20

absence of the ship in the ancient admiralty cases would

21

make any judgment rendered by the appellate court, or on

22

remand the trial court, meaningless, then the court under

23

concepts of mootness or case in controversy could decline

24

jurisdiction and dismiss the case.

25

the situation in this case, when the Government has had

But again that's not

1

the money from the inception of the suit, and even under

2

their position has the money today in the Treasury.

3

Certainly meaningful relief can be fashioned in this case.
QUESTION:

4

So you're saying the old admiralty

5

cases are no different from what you would say should

6

apply here?
MR. BEILEY:

7

I'm saying the old admiralty cases,

8

Justice Scalia, should not have any relevance to currency

9

cases.

10

To the extent they do I think the principles are

the same.
QUESTION:

11

Well, I'm not sure I agree with you

12

that they shouldn't have any relevance.

13

they have any relevance?

14

normal rule that Congress enacts against the background of

15

the common law and we interpret their statutes against

16

that background?

17

MR. BEILEY:

Why shouldn't

Doesn't Congress, isn't our

Congress in this case said that the

18

procedure of forfeiture cases shall as far as practicable

19

conform to admiralty.

20

that procedurally you follow admiralty practice in

21

forfeiture cases, but we do not read that as a declaration

22

by Congress that every rule of substantive law that has

23

ever been developed in admiralty cases ipso facto apply in

24

forfeiture cases.

25

held.

We interpret that as a position

Nor do I know of any court that has so

QUESTION:

1

I suppose if the money in this case

2

wasn't in the bank or in some place but it was in a bag

3

and somebody stole it, I suppose then that would be, the

4

court of appeals could dismiss the case?
MR. BEILEY:

5

Does Your Honor's hypothetical mean

6

stole it during the course of the trial court proceeding

7

or after the judgment?

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BEILEY:

After the judgment.
Your Honor, that again gets to the

10

issue, as the Government suggests, about the necessity for

11

posting of bond.

12

takes.

13

example, if you wish to preserve the res put a bond to

14

protect and insure the continuance of the presence.

15

you have the right to do that if you wish to put up a

16

bond.

17

shouldn't be converted into a jurisdictional risk as the

18

Government would seek to do in this case.

That is a financial risk any litigant

That shouldn't be a jurisdictional issue.

For

Our point though that that's a financial risk.

QUESTION:

19

And

It

Under your view the language in the

20

Rio Grande was really quite unnecessary in which the court

21

indicated that jurisdiction remained if the res was

22

removed by some improper action or by accident or by

23

fraud?

24

the case?

25

That was just quite unnecessary under your view of

MR. BEILEY:

No, Your Honor.

I think that case

1

held that initially, that initial seizure vested

2

jurisdiction, and that certainly an accidental or an

3

improper removal of the res would not divest jurisdiction.

4

QUESTION:

Well, why would the court have

5

qualified its language then to say that accidental or

6

improper removal?

7

the res, any relinquishment or any disappearance of the

8

res suffices.

9

It would just say that any transfer of

MR. BEILEY:

Your Honor, if the res were an

10

immutable rule of jurisdiction, if a court lacked power to

11

proceed to adjudicate a case without that res before it,

12

then I would submit that any removal of the res for any

13

reason, accidental, improper, act of God, or otherwise,

14

should divest the court of jurisdiction.

15

exception in essence highlights the original rule as we

16

interpret the admiralty cases, which is that jurisdiction

17

is complete upon initial seizure unless the removal would

18

make the court's judgment meaningless and worthless

19

because there's no basis to afford the parties relief.

I think the

)

20

QUESTION:

Well, but I'm still not quite sure

21

what your explanation is for the accidental, fraudulent,

22

or improper removal language.

23

quite unnecessary qualifications.

24

Grande court should have said and any subsequent removal

25

by the res is insufficient to destroy jurisdiction.

It seems to me those are

MR. BEILEY:

With the two exceptions that I read

out of the admiralty cases, Justice Kennedy --

MR. BEILEY:

All right.
-- the useless judgment and the

voluntary abandonment situation which came up in one of

the other old admiralty cases.

QUESTION:

All right.

QUESTION:

Didn't the Government make some

agreement with the bank early on - -

MR. BEILEY:

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice White, they did.
-- that they would not, that they

could foreclose but they wouldn't, they would hold the

proceeds subject to the bank's lien?

MR. BEILEY:

Justice White, the agreement was

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BEILEY:

Yes.
During the course of the

19

proceedings the Government got a sales offer and, on joint

20

motion with my clients consent, asked the trial court to

21

sell the property and take the proceeds from the property

22

and put those proceeds in the court registry as a

23

substitute for the realty.

QUESTION:

MR. BEILEY:

And did they do that?
Yes, they did, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, how did they ever get the

proceeds out of the court registry?
MR. BEILEY:

After the judgment became final

they asked the marshall to wire transfer the funds by
bookkeeping entries to the Treasury.
QUESTION:

I see.

So you think whatever they,

you don't think there was an agreement then with the bank
that they would hold the proceeds?
MR. BEILEY:

Well, we think the Eleventh Circuit

misinterpreted the stipulation.

That is not a focal point

of our argument here because we - QUESTION:

So you don't rely on any agreement

whatsoever?
MR. BEILEY:
QUESTION:
MR. BEILEY:

That's correct.
Okay.
We don't think this Court took

jurisdiction, certiorari jurisdiction to interpret a
stipulation.
QUESTION:

I would think you would, if it was

sort of a breech of faith by the Government you would
certainly be relying on it.
MR. BEILEY:

The stipulation indicated that our

rights would be without prejudice.

By wire transferring

the funds we think we have been prejudiced but we are not
relying on that as the basis for the relief that we seek

QUESTION:

Are you going to deal in your oral

argument, Mr. Beiley, with the Government's appropriations

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

The Government takes the position

that now the funds somehow are in the Treasury, and that
being in the Treasury the appropriations clause precludes

our funds.

We say it's

The Government says it's their funds.

That's

the issue for a court on the merits to decide.
QUESTION:

But the money that you're talking

about basically was remitted to the Treasury, was it not?
MR. BEILEY:
Honor.

Well, we don't concede that, Your

Money we believe to be a fungible asset.

We

believe that all that happens when money moves from one
account to the other are bookkeeping entries.

I think

either the First or the Third Circuit or perhaps both
expressed it best when they said to predicate jurisdiction
on what Government pocket holds the money is seemingly an
artful way to determine Federal or public jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

It would seem arguable at least that

Congress drew a distinction, that there are different
funds that Government deposits are housed in and once it
goes into the Treasury it's subject to this appropriations
clause limitation that it wouldn't be subject to if it
simply remained in a different account.
MR. BEILEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, if the

Government's position on that point is correct, the
Government in the classic in personam case, take a case, a
student loan hypothetical where the Government sues,
collects.

The defendant chooses not to supercede and the

Government collects money from the defendant while the
appeal is pending and sends the money to the Treasury,
which they would have a right to do where you have an
unsuperseded judgment.

Is the Government going to take

the position in that case that the appropriations clause
bars relief because in an in personam case the loser of a
student loan claim did not supercede?
QUESTION:
the statute.

Well, I suppose you have to look at

But it seems to me your argument that money

is fungible, that it's an intangible, cuts against your
appropriation arguments.

You were the, you began by

saying that oh, this is not, I assume you meant this is
not public money.

The title is contested to this.

But

the minute you say that it's simply an accounting entry
that is fungible then it seems to me that that weakens

1

your argument under the appropriations clause.
MR. BEILEY:

2

Your Honor, I don't think so.

3

think that what happens when money is in a bank account,

4

you have a debtor-creditor relationship, the bank and the

5

depositor.

6

owes money to the Government which has not yet been

7

resolved until this appeal is resolved on the merits.

8

the First or the Third Circuit or perhaps both have said,

11

You have a situation here where the Treasury

As

everywhere.
But more importantly, and I didn't quite finish

12

my answer to the appropriations clause question posed by

13

the Chief Justice, to the extent we need statutory

14

authority to get these funds we have two sets of statutes.

15

We have 28 U.S. Code 2465 which says quite plainly that

16

forfeited property shall be returned to a successful

17

claimant, and we have 28 U.S. Code 524 (c)(1)(d) which is

18

the Department of Justice asset forfeiture funds which

19

says one purpose for which forfeited funds should be used

20

is to be paid to claimants.

21

QUESTION:

So to the extent - -

What do you do with 1301(d) that says

22

a law may be construed to make an appropriation only if

23

the law specifically states that an appropriation is made?

statutes set forth appropriations out of forfeited funds

It says that forfeited funds shall be returned

QUESTION:

And you say that is language of

specific appropriation?

9

There is nothing in those statutes that say

I believe it is, Your Honor.

Specific appropriation for use of forfeited funds

If

10

forfeited, if Congress says forfeited funds shall be paid

11

to a successful claimant the fact that the Government has

12

levied and put the funds in the Treasury doesn't change

13

that those funds can serve that purpose.

as a jurisdictional matter and the court of appeals had

MR. BEILEY:

Honor.
QUESTION:

So it, it really doesn't make -- even

22

if they had transferred the money they might have to pay a

judgment, just like the Government has to pay judgments a

QUESTION:

When they lose a tax case sometimes

they have to - (Laughter.)
QUESTION:
well just a question?

Mr. Beiley, can I ask you kind of,
Do you understand the Government

and the court of appeals to be taking the position the
case is moot?
MR. BEILEY:

They, in their brief they take the

position that there are mootness concerns.

They don't

quite come out and say that the case is moot but they
suggest mootness concerns.

We don't think the case is

moot.
QUESTION:

It seems to me it either, if it were

moot we ought to vacate the judgment below, would be the
normal disposition, and then you'd get your money back.
That's our normal disposition with moot cases, and I'm not
quite clear what your understanding is or what their
understanding is of the mootness case.
MR. BEILEY:

I'm not particularly certain as to

what the Government means why the case is moot.

If their

position is that the appropriations clause makes it moot,
I believe I answered that contention a moment ago.
QUESTION:

I thought, thinking that their theory

was taking the res out of the territorial jurisdiction of
the district rendered the case non-justiciable or moot,

which would be true if the plaintiff were still trying to

get the money out of the res, but this is the opposite

here.

Traditionally the amount of a

The position that we assert, that

7

Very early on this Court in two old cases, Adam

8

v. Saenger and Nations v. Johnson, held, and I don't think

9

I can state it any better, that no rule can be a sound one

10

which will deprive a party of his right to have his case

11

submitted to an appellate court.

that that party is subject to the court's jurisdiction for

all purposes for which justice is required.

No, Justice White.

QUESTION:

A claim

Well, I understand, but what I'm

5

suggesting is you don't have a single United States

6

Supreme Court case that supports the first proposition you

7

are advancing here.

8

with the position here.
MR. LONG:

9

There's no case that's on all fours

We do not have a case that's on all

10

fours, but respectfully I think the Brig Ann and the Rio

11

Grande are quite strong support for us.
QUESTION:

12

The Rio Grande would support you if

13

they had taken the money away from the district court

14

before you got your judgment, and you would be absolutely

15

right.

16

MR. LONG:

Well, I can't imagine that if the

17

other side had happened to get control of the ship and go

18

off with it that the result would have been any different.

19

What the court was concerned about in that case was that

20

there was a clear violation of statute.

21

bond was posted in that case and the court made a great

22

deal of that and said it was clearly contrary to law for

the property to be carried off.

1

proceeding, the judgment must be satisfied out of the res.

2

If the court can't control the res it cannot enforce a

3

judgment in rem.

4

Our second point is that the United States did

5

not consent to the entry of a judgment in personam when

6

its agents filed an in rem forfeiture proceeding.

7

Congress has not authorized the entry of a judgment in

8

personam in petitioner's favor, and there is no in rem

9

exception to sovereign immunity.

10

Third, petitioner's appeal is barred by the

11

appropriations clause.

12

13

appropriated funds to pay a judgment for petitioner.

14

Proceeds of the sale of the res

And finally, there is nothing unfair or unjust

15

about requiring petitioner to take reasonable steps to

18

can obtain an automatic stay by posting a bond which

19

protects the Government against the costs of an appeal,

20

including the costs of storing the property, and if a

losing claimant cannot afford to post a bond the court has

22

discretion to stay the judgment without requiring a bond.

11

correctly, the court refused to enter a Munsingware order

that suggestion, which is a radical one.

We urge the Court to reject

The rule that the court must control the res in

The rule is regularly applied by the courts of

Moreover, and this is a central point of our

position, Congress has legislated in this area on the

14

assumption that the traditional rules of in rem

jurisdiction apply in this area unless modified by

statute.

For example, it

party to do that, allows the Government to do it in your

hypothetical, any final judgment can be executed.
