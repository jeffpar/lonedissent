ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. KLONOFF

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KLONOFF:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

14

Section 525 of The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil

15

Relief Act excludes a service member's period of military

16

service from any period provided by law for the redemption

17

of real property forfeited for nonpayment of real estate

18

taxes.

19

The issue here is whether a service member must

20

show hardship in order to invoke section 525.

21

that the courts below, in imposing such a requirement,

22

violated this Court's case law and statutory

23

interpretation for three reasons.

24
25

We submit

First, section 525 by its plain language imposes
no hardship requirement.

Second, several other sections of the statute do

1
2

impose a hardship requirement, while other sections, like

3

section 525, do not.

4

deliberately when it did not impose a hardship requirement

5

under, section 525.

This confirms that Congress acted

Third, this Court has made clear that statutes

6

7

providing benefits to service members should be liberally

8

construed.

9

For these reasons, we submit that this Court

10

should enforce the statute as written and decline

11

respondent's invitation to rewrite the statute on policy

12

grounds.

13

The facts in this case are simple, and I will

14

spend just a moment on them.

15

Colonel Conroy had been on continuous active duty in the

16

U.S. Army since 1966.

17

in May 1973, and paid all real estate taxes between 1973

18

and 1983.

19

having received no tax notices from the town.

At the time of trial,

He purchased the property at issue

He did not pay his taxes in '84 through '86,

20

The Town of Danforth seized his land under Maine

21

law and sold it in two parcels to respondents Aniskoff and

22

H. C. Haynes in December 1986.

23

Upon learning of the sale, Colonel Conroy acted

24

promptly in asserting his rights.

25

Haynes refused to give up the land, Colonel Conroy brought

When Aniskoff and

1

quiet title actions based on section 525.
The trial court held that despite section 525's

2

3

clear language, a service member had to show hardship from

4

military service, which Colonel Conroy did not do.

5

The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine affirmed the

6

Superior Court by an equally divided vote and did not

7

express any reasoning.
We submit that this case should be controlled by

8

9

this Court's decision last term in King v. St. Vincent's

10

Hospital.

11

who sought a 3-year leave of absence from his hospital

12

employer to join the Active Guard Reserve program as a

13

command sergeant major.

14

At issue in King was a National Guard member

He claimed that under the plain language of the

15

Veteran Reemployment Rights Act he was allowed to return

16

to his job with the same seniority, pay, and vacation as

17

if he had not left.

18

on the ground that the period requested was unreasonable.

19

The hospital denied the leave request

Although the statutory language contained no

20

limits for leave requests, the lower courts -- both the

21

Eleventh Circuit and the district court -- imposed a

22

reasonableness requirement because of their concern about

23

the burdens placed on employers of allowing employees to

24

return after long leaves of absences.

25

This Court unanimously reversed -- Justice

Thomas did not participate -- because, really for the same

2

reasons that I am urging here:

3

section at issue was clear, 2) other parts of the statute,

4

by contrast, explicitly imposed time limits, and 3) the

5

statute provided benefits to members of the armed

6

services.

7

1) the language of the

The Court acknowledged that the statute was

8

harsh, but refused to rewrite the law and noted that that

9

was Congress' job.
Here, we have an identical situation.

10

The

11

language of section 525 is absolutely clear, and there has

12

been no claim as far as I know on any case that there is

13

an ambiguity in section 525.

14

Under this Court's case law, we submit that the

15

clear language of the statute should be the end of the

16

matter.

17

language of section 525 alone, since a review of the

18

statute indicates that several other sections, unlike

19

section 525, impose a hardship requirement explicitly, and

20

we cited numerous examples on page 12, footnotes 11 and

21

12, of our opening brief.

22

However, it is even clearer than just the

We have also cited a number of examples of other

23

parts of the statute that, like section 525, contain no

24

prejudice requirement, so it seems to me quite clear that

25

the statute was very carefully drafted and that when

1

Congress wanted to impose a hardship requirement, it did

2

so explicitly, and we point for example, section 560,

3

which is of particular interest, since right within the

4

same section you've got juxtaposition of a hardship and

5

no-hardship standard.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Klonoff, the statute really

7

doesn't say that any property sold in violation of the

8

Federal prohibition is not effectively sold, does it?

9

that a matter of State law?

Is

I mean, could Maine law say

10

that if this statute is violated and we goof and make the

11

sale within the 18-month period, a good faith purchaser

12

nonetheless has title, and maybe you have a cause of

13

action against Maine but not against the BFP?

14

MR. KLONOFF:

I don't think that the State could

15

do that, they could override the statute.

16

variety of causes of action --

QUESTION:

Well, they're not overriding the

statute.

The statute doesn't really say that the transfer

QUESTION:

Well, it has that effect.

If you say so, but I mean, that's

22

what I'm asking.

There are a

the State of Maine,

3

I mean, maybe he has a cause of action against
if that's what Maine says.

MR. KLONOFF:

But the whole concept of a

4

redemption is the right to actually -- if title is passed,

5

the right to take back title.

6

is constructed is title doesn't even pass until the end of

7

the redemption period.

8

QUESTION:

In Maine,

the way the law

You're saying that Maine does not

have the authority to give title until that period is
10

passed, and because it is tolled Maine therefore can never

11

give even -- cannot even give a good title subject to

12

defeasance later.

13

MR. KLONOFF:

Not inconsistent with the statute.

14

We read the statute as allowing the serviceman,

15

is transferred and there's a period of redemption, to take

16

the title back.

17

I suppose what could be done,

if title

since it talks

18

about any period of redemption provided by law, is, I

1

suppose, to not have any redemption period in this

20

situation.

21

QUESTION:

No, but I just wanted to make sure

22

that I understood what you were saying to Justice Scalia,

23

and I thought the theory that you were espousing was that

24

because the period of service is not included - - cannot be

25

included in computing the redemption period, that the

theory?

5

Isn't that your

States the title actually will pass, subject to the

redemption.

works is that the title would be returned.

If there's a redemption statute, the way it

QUESTION:

But that's not the way it works, on

your view, in Maine, is it?

11

MR. KLONOFF:

12

doesn't work that way.

MR. KLONOFF:

Because it never runs,

No, that's right.

In Maine it

So as we indicated, these sections and the

14

juxtaposition in 560 makes clear that Congress new how to

15

pose a hardship requirement when it wanted to do so.

16

And finally, as I indicated, this Court has made

17

clear in a number of cases that statutes of this sort must

18

be liberally construed in favor of the serviceman.

19

The court below -- the trial court -- did not

20

make a textual argument, but instead expressed concerns

21

about the possible impact of purchasers of property if

22

service members are allowed to come in years later to

23

redeem their property, but as in King, we submit that any

24

such concerns are for Congress and not for the court.

25

We think that in this case the lower court

1

misunderstood its role, believing that if a statute was

2

harsh, a court could ignore the plain language, but under

3

this Court's case law a court is almost never permitted to

4

ignore the plain language on policy grounds, and certainly

5

not for the reasons offered below.
This Court has made clear that the statute

6

7

literally read must be patently absurd, with consequences

8

so bizarre that Congress could not have intended them, and

9

it's been phrased in a number of different ways.
In the Crooks case from 1930, which has been

10
11

cited in Griffin and TVA v. Hill, it was made clear that

12

it's not enough that it's merely absurd, and that

13

oftentimes laws have effects that weren't contemplated,

14

but it's for Congress to decide the issue.
And this Court in a number of cases -- Griffin,

15
16

has said that harsh consequences are not enough, a

17

situation where a seaman was entitled to receive over

18

$300,000 from an employer because of a $412 withholding of

19

wages.

20

The TVA v. Hill, which involved a multimillion

21

dollar dam project which was stopped near completion, the

22

Court said that the result was curious, but not enough to

23

override - - and numerous other cases that this Court - -

24

and this Court has made clear in Estate of Cowart that

1

troubling, it is the duty of the court to enforce

2

Congress' language even if the court questions its wisdom.

3
4

juxtaposing 525 with the situation in King, we would

5

submit that there's not even an absurdity, let alone a

6

situation that's so patently absurd that Congress could

7

not have intended it.

8
9

~

Now, looking at section 525 and actually

In King, for example, it's interesting to note
that the 3-year period was not the end of the possibility

10

in that situation.

11

of the oral argument in that case, in the transcript,

12

about whether or not the period could be renewed four

13

times for, say, 12 years, and the answer that the

14

Assistant to the Solicitor General gave was that

15

theoretically that's possible.

16

There was a question asked at page 6

She didn't know of a case, but theoretically it

17

was possible, and the situation, then, you have in King,

18

was somebody coming back 12 years and basically -- and in

19

King, for example, the individuals reflected in the

20

Eleventh Circuit opinion was the manager of security could

21

come in 12 years later and just walk in and demand his job

22

back after somebody had been hired and so forth.

23

And so really, that is or could be a harsh and

24

troubling situation, but it was not enough, and in fact

25

the Court -- although the Eleventh Circuit resolved the

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about this

case just to get it fixed in my mind?
If you win, what it means is the period of
redemption has not yet expired -MR. KLONOFF:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And therefore your client has a right

11

to redeem, and I gather your position is he will retain

12

that right to redeem as long as he remains on active duty.

13

MR. KLONOFF:

14

although that's not reflected --

15

QUESTION:

Well, he's actually now retired,

Well, then he just has the right to

16

redeem as of now, so he could be compelled to exercise it

17

within a fixed period of time, could he?

18

MR. KLONOFF:

That's correct.

I think pursuant

19

to the stipulation that we set out in our brief and that's

20

set out in the opinion, I don't believe there's any issue

21

in terms of either side complying with State law, but

22

formally in this situation you would make a tender.

23

QUESTION:

He would have to make a tender of the

24

back taxes plus interest, whatever the statute provides

25

for redemption.

MR. KLONOFF:

2

QUESTION:

If you had a person -- you don't, as

3

I understand it - - who was still on active duty and he's

4

perhaps going to serve another 15, 20 years, would he have

5

the right under the statute, under your view, to say to

6

the property owner, I haven't decided what I want to do.

7

I just want to make it clear that the period of redemption

8

hasn't run yet, and I'll make up my mind just before I get

9

out of service.

10

*

That's exactly right.

MR. KLONOFF:

He would have that right, and I

11

think then the property owner would have civil causes of

12

action available, and that would be true, by the way, to

13

the taxing authority.

14

could levy against - -

They could sue for damages, they

QUESTION:

They could sue for the back taxes.

16

MR. KLONOFF:

17

Let me just say, though, you're positing, I

Exactly, levy taxes.

18

think, a situation in which somebody would really have an

19

incentive to want to stretch the period of redemption out,

20

and that's what the lower court was talking about, posing

21

the situation of somebody waiting 30 years and simply

22

not - -

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose the practical matter

24

is he might well be willing to sell the property for a

sum.

QUESTION:

These things often

That's correct.

And the longer the period, the more

of a nuisance rights he has, the better bargaining

6

position he is in in that negotiation.

7

MR. KLONOFF:

Well, that's correct, but let me

8

provide, if I could, some perspective on that, because

9

really what we're talking about and the assumption, I

10

think, of the so-called absurd consequences is the idea of

11

a service member who has a valid and just debt just really

12

out of reasons for dishonesty not paying off the debt and

13

trying to abuse, if you will, the rights that are

14

provided.

relevant to this case?

22

MR. KLONOFF:

Well, what it provides is that an

individual can be court-martialled for conduct of a nature

24

that would bring discredit on the Armed Forces, and there

are a number of cases, such as United States v.

Sivinovich, the U.S. Army Court of Military Review of

2

1988, applying that precisely to the bad debt situation.

3

QUESTION:

Does it bring discredit on the Armed

4

Forces to exercise rights granted by Congress to an

5

officer of the United States Army?
MR. KLONOFF:

6

That's what the Court has held, if

7

there is a just debt.

Let me go further, though, than

8

just the Article 134.

The U.S. Army has specific

9

regulations at part 513 of 32 C.F.R., which says that if a

10

soldier is not trying to resolve unpaid debts promptly, or

11

complaints of the sort are received, punitive measures can

12

be provided such as a denial of reenlistment,

13

administrative separation from the service or other sorts

14

of punishments.
QUESTION:

15

Those may well deal with individual

16

cases, Mr. Klonoff, but if we're now turning to the bad

17

consequences of adopting the position you say the statute

18

requires, I think perhaps from the point of view of the

19

State or the town, it's simply an inability to sell at a

20

tax sale.

21

The titles simply are too uncertain.
MR. KLONOFF:

Well, we would respectfully

22

disagree that that's the outcome.

military service.

later be a cloud on title, such as a fraudulent deed,

2

ineffective notice, or failure to comply with the

3

requirements of a tax sale.

4

that -- there's a redemption period for a period of mental

5

incompetence, and what is done in these tax sales,

6

traditionally.what was done in this case, is the execution

7

of a quit claim deed, which means, in effect, that the

8

purchase gets whatever, any title there is, and so the

9

State could go forward, if it can't ascertain the

10
11

^

Many States have requirements

situation, and actually sell the property, and the risk -QUESTION:

Yes, but a quit claim deed is a good

12

deal different than -- you can't get title insurance on

13

the basis of a quit claim deed.

14

MR. KLONOFF:

Well, that's correct, and that's

15

why a person purchasing the property takes all kinds of

16

risks, and this is something, along with many other

17

things, that can be looked into.

18

I would note that, for example, the statute,

19

section 581 has a certification procedure, and in Maine,

20

for example, it's very common for lawyers to write to the

21

Armed Forces and actually get a determination whether

22

someone is in military service.

23

situations, the people in question are there locally and

24

so the issue can be resolved.

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

MR. MANNING:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I would like to begin by addressing Justice

20

Scalia's question about the bona fide purchaser.

21

statute contains one provision which explicitly addresses

22

when a bona fide purchaser of land can obtain relief when

23

a transaction is affected by the Soldiers' and Sailors'

Civil Relief Act.

1
t

If a default judgment is entered against a

2

service member, and the service member can show within a

3

specified period subsequent to his military service that

4

he was prejudiced in his ability to defend the suit

5

because of his military service, he can have that judgment

6

vacated.

7

The provision explicitly provides that any

8

property obtained by a bona fide purchaser for value

9

pursuant to that judgment will be protected against the

10

vacation of that default judgment by the service member.

11

Now, this illustrates one important point - - two

12

important points.

13

similar protection, so the right to redeem is tolled

14

irrespective of any State law that would protect a bona

15

fide purchaser.

16

First, under section 525, there is no

him.

MR. MANNING:

It is conceivable, Justice Scalia,

2

that that is the case, but it seems to me more likely,

3

given the comprehensiveness of the statutory scheme and

4

the extent to which Congress was careful in specifying

5

which remedies would and would not be available and the

6

desire of Congress to protect the service member from

7

various State law judgments and liabilities during the

8

period of service, that it's much more likely that the

9

force of section 525, which is broad and absolute in its

10

terms, must be taken as preemptive of any State law right

11

to vest the title in a bona fide purchaser.

12

Otherwise, a State could simply, by a variety of

13

State rules, eliminate a protection that is broad, that is

14

mandatory, and that is unqualified in its application.

15

Along the lines of the implications of the

16

statute, I'd like to point out that as Justice Brandeis

17

said in Ebert v. Poston, this statute was so carefully

18

drafted that very little is left to conjecture, and given

19

the act's disparate inclusion and omission of a prejudice

20

requirement in its various sections, the failure to

21

include a prejudice requirement in section 525 must be

22

understood as a deliberate policy choice.

23

Congress carefully considered when prejudice

24

should, and more importantly should not, be a factor in

25

awarding relief under the act, and it obviously decided

that in section 525 it should not be awarded

it should

3

Now, to highlight a point that Mr. Klonoff made,

4

I'd like to direct the Court's attention to section 560 of

5

the Appendix.

QUESTION:

6

7

10

When you say, of the Appendix, are

you referring to the Appendix to your brief?
MR. MANNING:

8

9

Section 560 specifically addresses --

Rehnquist, it's the Appendix to title 50, where the act is
codified.

Section 560 of the Appendix to title --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. MANNING:

13
14

No, I apologize, Chief Justice

Is that cited anywhere in your brief?
It is cited.

It's cited and

discussed in the text, Your Honor.
The Appendix to title 50 provides relief from

15

tax sales of certain kinds of property.

Now, the property

16

at issue here is not among the classes of property that's

17

covered by that provision.

18

real property, it relates to residential, business,

19

professional, and agricultural property owned by the

20

service member at the commencement of service and still

21

owned at the time of the tax sale.

It relates to -- in terms of

If a tax sale is to occur under that --

If -- before a tax sale can occur, a court order

1

2

must be obtained for that type of property, and the

3

service member or his dependents may get a stay of the tax

4

sale during the period of military service unless the

service member's ability to pay or his dependents' ability

6

to pay the taxes is not materially affected by the

7

military service.

8

requirement contained in that provision which supplies

9

relief from the tax sale itself.

So there is an explicit prejudice

10

In the very next provision of section 560, the

11

act provides that the period of redemption, the right of

12

redemption or the right to bring an action for redemption,

13

shall extend throughout the period of the act and for

14

6 months thereafter.

15

It has no mention of material effect of military

16

service.

17

the statute, and that provision, which dates back in its

18

original form to the 1918 legislation, shows that Congress

19

intentionally distinguished between the kinds of relief it

20

would be providing for tax forfeitures, and when it got to

21

the point of redemption, it decided to provide an absolute

22

protection that extended without regard to prejudice

23

throughout the period of military service.

It has no prejudice requirement in the text of

Now, respondents don't claim that the similarly
worded language of section 525 is ambiguous.

What they

.

1

claim is that the Court should not apply the statute as

2

written because of the practical consequences of allowing

3

a career service member to redeem his property throughout

4

the period of military service without a showing of

5

prejudice.

6

*

Now, apart from the fact that the practical

7

consequences argument is foreclosed by this Court's

8

decision in King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, the statute as

9

written is far from absurd.

Respondents don't claim that

10

it's absurd to redeem the tolling provision -- to toll the

11

redemption provision for service members in general.

12

they claim is that it is absurd to do so without a

13

particularized inquiry in each case into whether there has

14

been prejudice.

15

What

Now, that is simply not absurd.

Congress, because the period of redemption is

16

the last safety valve before property is lost irrevocably,

17

it is perfectly rational for Congress to have decided that

18

it would provide service members with the assurance that

19

their property would not be lost forever during their

20

period of military service.

21

Because of its self-executing nature, section

22

525 provides service members with the peace of mind that

23

they will not have to rely on a court's determination in

24

hindsight that this or that tour of duty was or was not

25

prejudicial to their ability to redeem their property, and
22

so what it does is, in effect, it gives the service
members an effective right to wait their period of
military service before exercising their right of
redemption, otherwise we doubt that many service members
would take the risk that a court would, in hindsight, find
that they had not been prejudiced by their tour of
military duty.
QUESTION:

I take it the provision which allows

for the collection of taxes on real property does not
apply to him, though, because he was not occupying it for
a dwelling.
MR. MANNING:

That's right.

It was vacant land

that he was holding to have as a vacation spot.
Finally, I would like to point out that the
uncertainties that respondents note, and the cloud on tax
title that they assert as the absurdity in this case,
would exist even if there were a prejudice requirement
under the statute.
If a service member were entitled to toll his
redemption period upon a showing of prejudice, it would be
equally difficult, indeed, impossible to tell from the
chain of title whether there was a service member in the
chain of title, and whether the service member's
particular tour of duty was prejudicial to his ability to
redeem.

of section 525.

right now, because I agree with these gentlemen, section

560 is important.

14

Not having any expertise in this when this case

was brought to me, I looked at 560, because it's the

particular section that seems to apply here, and I read it

through, and I checked to see, did this fit within the

18

area of someone who owned real property that was occupied

19

for dwelling purposes or professional purposes or business

20

or agriculture?

21

No.

It's open land.

It doesn't apply.

But as these gentlemen called it to my

22

attention, I looked at that subsection (2).

23

subsection (2) of section 560 indicates that the court

24

must be asked to approve a tax sale if a tax sale takes

somebody's got to ask the question.
QUESTION:

2

Well, no, I don't think so at all.

3

You could say that some people might be prejudiced by not

4

being able to hire a lawyer in time to do this and that

5

and therefore they can't file a lawsuit right away,

6

therefore we'll give them 5 years to avoid the danger of

that prejudice.

prove prejudice or not.

They get the 5 years whether they can

MR. CUDDY:

9

Okay.

In making the transition,

10

then, to the redemption issue, whether or not one gets the

11

benefit of redemption or doesn't get the benefit of

12

redemption, you have to make a finding of, is this going

13

to provide a hardship, or in the alternative, is it

14

sufficient that someone has the status of a military

15

person?
What I'm suggesting to you is that section 510

16
17

and section 560 both -- both have a implicit concept of

18

hardship or prejudice.
QUESTION:

19

Yes, but it seems to me the fact that

20

it's present in 560 demonstrates that it's presence in 510

21

is irrelevant, because if it's presence in 510 justifies

22

reading it into 525, you wouldn't have had to have it in

23

560 .

explicit hardship requirement in 525 because it's in 510,

which is up at the beginning of the act, and that hardship

requirement spills over into all of the act, but if that

were true, there wouldn't be any hardship requirement in

requirements of the statute, King v. St. Vincent's

16

Hospital, decided by this Court a year ago, has some

17

pertinent language in it, but I would respectfully suggest

18

that the issues in the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act

19

and the issues before this Court in the Soldiers' and

Sailors' Civil Relief Act are disparate, different

matters.

It is true that they relate to servicemen, and

it is true that they relate to interpretation.

citing this case is just misplaced.

After you

This act that we're dealing with here, the

1

2

Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, is an act that is

3

germane to itself in terms of its history, its enactment,

4

then its reenactment.

5

Reemployment Rights Act has nothing to do, directly or

6

indirectly, with the Soldiers' & Sailors' Civil Relief

7

Act.

8

9

It has -- the Veteran's

The references, however, in that act to
interpreting the statute in the context of the full

10

statute I think are very germane, and they apply here very

11

strongly because we're not talking about one section in

12

isolation, again with judicial blinders.

13

about one section in the context of an entire statute, and

14

how it affects and interacts with the entire statute.

15

We're talking

And again, I reference this Court's decision in

16

LeMaistre because this Court -- although it didn't

17

anticipate where we are today, this Court back in 1948 did

18

anticipate the tension and dynamic and interrelationship

19

of those two sections and found them to be supportive of

20

one another, not inconsistent or mutually exclusive.

21

I would also suggest, and I think I may have

22

mentioned it but I want to be sure I mentioned it, the

23

courts that deal with the issue of real estate taking, of

24

seizing for taxes, they -- and the cases we've cited in

they support the proposition that the legitimacy of

2

deeding property, the whole concept of the title, the

3

chain of title in property, demands for that process that

4

there be some showing of hardship or prejudice.

5

They talk about career servicemen and noncareer

6

servicemen, and I think that that's another way of saying

7

prejudice, or hardship.

8

talking about, because implicitly if one is a career

9

person, one has a regular income, one is under reasonably

That's really what they're

10

situations, unless one can demonstrate that there's a

11

hardship and I think that's where the language career

12

comes into play, and it really has its foundation in the

13

concept of hardship.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Cuddy, can I ask you to address

15

the point the Government makes about where the burden of

16

this uncertainty should lie, and whether it's so absurd to

17

place the burden where they say it's been placed.

18

doesn't seem to me absurd to say, as they claim the

19

statute provides, in 560, the -- which stays the whole

20

sale.

It

You want to come in and stay the whole sale.

21

MR. CUDDY:

22

QUESTION:

Right.
Well, the statute says, if you want

23

to stay the whole sale, you have to prove the hardship,

24

but if the sale goes forward and all you want to do is

25

have a later right to redeem, you don't have to prove the

1

hardship, because, says the Government -- what does

2

hardship mean?

3

I mean, this fellow's in military service, he's

4

fighting a war somewhere, or giving out food somewhere, or

5

doing something, and can't get home, and his advisor tells

6

him, don't worry, if you can prove hardship, you can

7

always redeem that property, and he asks him, well, what

8

does proving hardship consist of?
He says, oh, it's a very nice question.

9

Proving

10

hardship.

Maybe you don't have enough money because

11

you've been shipped overseas and have -- you know, have to

12

make all -- I wouldn't want to have to gamble on the fact

13

that I could prove hardship.

14

So why isn't it perfectly sensible to say, you

15

know, at least for purposes of the redemption provision,

16

we're going to give the serviceman a free ride -- he

17

doesn't have to prove the hardship?

18

MR. CUDDY:

Because if you were living in

19

Danforth or for that matter by Pease Air Force Base or

20

Loring Air Force Base in Maine, where a lot of people --

21

military people have property, and for whatever reason

22

they elect not to continue to pay taxes on their property,

and the municipalities, which derive their revenue and

support from that property, seize that property and sell

it, and you are on their mailing list, and you happen to

get a solicitation, come by some great property in Maine,

2

150 acres, or 30, or 40, or 50 acres, and you check the

title, all you're going to know is that there was a tax

4

sale, and you hire a very competent lawyer, and he or she

5

checks that tax sale and is satisfied that the

6

requirements have been complied with in terms of effecting

7

a tax sale, what you have done to the conveyancing is, you

8

have raised a significant cloud because of this status.

9

What you have done to the Town of Danforth or

10

the Town of Limestone or Caribou, Maine, is you have

deflated the values of that property, because now, based

upon -- potentially, this Court's interpretation -- there

is a great risk here.

QUESTION:

Well, there -- but there's a risk

anyway.

you're advising the person who wants to buy the property

from the tax sale.

him the great comfort of saying, don't worry -- don't
