Ms. Webb.

There are two questions presented by this

appeal.

unquestioned jurisdiction can abstain from hearing an

5

action validly before it simply because of the presence of

6

a later-filed State court action.

7

whether the abstention decision of the district court is

8

reviewed de novo or for abuse of discretion.

The first is whether a district court with

This cannot be an exceptional circumstance which

appropriate, a Federal court must begin with one of the

21

fundamental precepts of our Federal judicial system, and

right to decline the exercise of valid jurisdiction than

24

to usurp that which is not given.

1

Abstention is an extraordinary and narrow

2

exception to a Federal court's unflagging obligation to

3

exercise its valid jurisdiction.

4

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Webb, are you assuming that

5

an action for a declaratory judgment in that respect is

6

the same as an action for an injunction or for damages

7

because the declaratory judgment statute which you set

8

forth in your brief at page 3 says that the district court

9

may declare the rights.

10
11

It certainly suggests discretion

to do so or not to do so, doesn't it?
MS. WEBB:

Your Honor, there seems to be some

12

discretion in the declaratory judgment statute.

13

believe the discretion is not whether or not a district

14

court may hear the case, but whether or not the district

15

court may grant the release asked for.

16

We

There are many occasions in which declaratory

17

relief is sought, but declaratory relief isn't appropriate

18

for one reason or another.

19

it's -- the Voting Rights Act precludes the granting of

20

declaratory relief.

21

precludes the granting of declaratory relief.

22

cited by my co-counsel, Mansour v. Green, the Eleventh

23

Amendment barred the granting of declaratory relief.

What do you do with the Brillhart

MS. WEBB:

We believe that the Brillhart case, a

5

decision almost 50 years old at this point, cannot be read

6

in a vacuum.

7

intervening decisions, in Colorado River, Moses Cone, and

8

most recently in the NOPSI decision, in which this Court

9

has applied a different type of analysis to cases

It must be read in light of this Court's

10

involving the Declaratory Judgment Act.

Well, were all of the cases that you

described as the more modern cases, did those all involve

MS. WEBB:

17

Colorado River did not.

was begun as a declaratory judgment action seeking a

19

declaration that the Arbitration Act applied.

After

light of the fact that there is a State court action

2

pending, I don't think it's a good idea to issue the

3

declaratory judgment you want and therefore, exercising

4

the discretion I have not to issue the declaratory

5

judgment, though I don't have any discretion whether to

6

take all the evidence, I won't give you the declaratory

judgment.

I don't believe so.

In the first

QUESTION:

I hope not, because that would be an

place --

11

awful waste of time if they have discretion not to issue

12

it, why don't they have discretion not to hear it?

13

MS. WEBB:

Well, in the first place you have to

14

start with the proposition that jurisdiction is

15

unflagging, and you have to go from there into --

16

QUESTION:

We've never said its unflagging.

17

We've said it's virtually unflagging and really haven't

18

even behaved as though it was.

19

MS. WEBB:

Well, certainly in Moses Cone and

20

NOPSI this Court has reversed abstention decisions in

21

declaratory judgment cases, which -- and the Court has

22

continuously emphasized the importance of the obligation

23

to exercise jurisdiction.

with the trial, the district court does not have the

2

discretion to deny the declaratory relief, either, if the

3

reason he's going to deny it she's going to deny it that

4

there's a State action pending, right?

5

MS. WEBB:

I don't believe that the fact that

6

there's a State action pending is a sufficient reason to

7

deny declaratory relief.

8

QUESTION:

Why do you say that?

9

MS. WEBB:

Because this Court has continuously

10

emphasized that the presence of a parallel action is no

11

bar to the Federal court's ruling on an issue.

12

QUESTION:

It seems to me a very good reason to

13

deny the declaratory relief, that there's a prior action

14

pending, comity, consideration for the State.

15

that a perfectly valid equitable consideration?

16

valid consideration for not issuing the injunction for the

it seems to me, for not accepting jurisdiction in the

MS. WEBB:

Well, we would certainly disagree

with your position that it's a valid reason for declining

to issue the requested relief, but the issue is not

Judgment Act.

3

The presence of a later-filed State court action

4

is not a reason to decline to hear a first-filed

5

declaratory judgment action.

6

It makes no sense, and it certainly does not

7

comport with the obvious congressional purpose in giving

8

Federal litigants a right to a declaratory judgment action

MS. WEBB:

1

We would suggest that the Declaratory-

2

Judgment Act represents such an important congressional

3

intent that litigants who have Federal jurisdiction be

allowed to retain their Federal jurisdiction and proceed

in Federal court, that abstention would not be appropriate

If a district judge finds, after looking at the
face of the pleadings, that it's most unlikely that he

10

will enter this declaratory judgment, then it seems to me

11

that he should stay the action, but you seem to think that

12

he has to proceed through the motions of hearing evidence

13

and come right up to the time when he's ready to issue his

14

decision.

15

That doesn't make sense.
MS. WEBB:

What we are suggesting is that the

16

district court has to engage in abstention analysis before

17

they can make a decision whether to abstain or not.

just let the case hang on the docket and see what happens

in the State proceeding.

4

MS. WEBB:

I'll

That's exactly what the district

5

court has done in this case, and we believe that the

6

district court's analysis was incorrect, because he

7

ignored the court's unflagging obligation to exercise

jurisdiction.

We think that the --

2

or stay a case of this nature.
However, we recognize that this Court has

3

indicated in Colorado River and Moses Cone in a

4

declaratory judgment case that there may be some certain

5

circumstances in which there is an extraordinary state

6

interest or other exceptional circumstances in which there

7

is an extraordinary State interest or other exceptional

8

circumstances in which abstention is appropriate, and we

9

suggest that those factors come from Moses Cone and

10
11

Colorado River and must be analyzed.
QUESTION:

So if the Colorado River factors

12

happen to balance out against you, why, you wouldn't be

13

here, I guess.

14

MS. WEBB:

Well, the Colorado River doctrine

15

states, when it's coupled with Moses Cone, that the

16

obligation to exercise jurisdiction is unflagging, and the

17

factors must be exercised or weighed in light of that

18

unflagging obligation.

jurisdiction over property --

QUESTION:

If you lose on the Colorado River

9

MS. WEBB:

The obligation only flags if

10

extraordinary circumstances exist, and the Court has

11

identified those extraordinary circumstances in the

12

various abstention doctrines -- Pullman, Burford,

13

Younger - - and the factors of Colorado River and Moses

14

Cone.

15

I think the NOPSI decision, which was quite

16

straightforwardly a declaratory and injunctive relief

17

lawsuit in which this Court did not defer to the district

18

court's discretion but instead analyzed it de novo in

19

light of the Burford and Younger abstention doctrines,

20

indicates clearly that the declaratory judgment cases are

21

not committed to the unfettered discretion of the district

court but rather must be analyzed under traditional

QUESTION:

Yes, right.
So you say there is

different standard for whether you issue the injunction

than for whether you agree to hear the whole case in the

first place.

17

MS. WEBB:

That's correct.

18

QUESTION:

So then we are confronted with the

19

problem that troubled Justice Kennedy and me that you're

MS. WEBB:

I'm not sure that there's no way to

2

avoid that.

For instance, if the Eleventh Amendment

3

sovereign immunity controls, and you have a declaratory

4

judgment action against a State, there's no reason why

5

that can't be addressed on summary judgment immediately.

6

There's nothing to prevent that issue from being resolved

7

before a full-blown trial on the merits.

8

QUESTION:

Oh, but that --

MS. WEBB:

It depends on the type --

QUESTION:

But that's not an equitable issue.

You're talking there a legal issue with respect to

do we get mad when they come into Federal court?

We don't, but there are times

This just isn't one of those circumstances,

MS. LIBERATO:

1

I say it needn't have, except to

2

the limited degree that those are logical factors for a

3

trial court to consider in exercising its discretion.

4

The principles underlying the unflagging

5

obligation of the court to consider a case are different,

6

because this is a declaratory judgment action and a

7

declaratory judgment action is discretionary, and there's

8

a specific legislative mandate that makes that

9

discretionary, and that's why it's different, that the

10

whole difference in this case is the fact it's a

11

declaratory judgment action.
If it were not, we wouldn't disagree that the

12

13

court has an unflagging duty to exercise jurisdiction, but

14

the fact of the matter is, this is a declaratory judgment

15

action, and Congress has said that that is discretionary,

16

as has this Court in Brillhart.

17

And so if I may come back to your question,

18

Justice White, only to say that yes, the factors apply in

19

the sense of making a common sense determination, but as

20

far as using the standard, the unflagging obligation

21

standard in applying those factors, that does not apply to

22

this case.

23

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose if the district court

24

had come out the other way, and had applied the Colorado

25

River factors against you, and you had appealed, the court

1

of appeals probably would have said, well -- would have

2

reversed, because the Colorado River factors shouldn't

3

decide the case.

4

MS. LIBERATO:

Well, I agree to the point that I

5

think that if the district court had agreed to hear this

6

case and granted declaratory relief, that the Fifth

7

Circuit would have reversed, because I don't think it's

8

necessary to go that far in this case, but I think it

9

would be a fair policy to say that the presumption is

10

against the district court exercising its declaratory

11

judgment relief authority if there is a parallel State

12

court action, and so I do believe --

13
14

QUESTION:

there wouldn't have been an appealable order, would it?

15

17

You say they would have reversed, but

MS. LIBERATO:

QUESTION:

Well, they wouldn't have reversed

18

19

shouldn't have the trial?

20

MS. LIBERATO:

Well, there are -- they could

21

have granted, I guess, arguably, a summary judgment.

22

think it's possible that that could arise.

23

cases that have come through the circuits where the court

24

has actually reversed the case based on an abuse of

25

discretion for hearing the case after the district court

I

There are some

1

2

granted the declaratory judgment relief.
As a matter of fact, most of those cases you'll

3

find in the petitioner's brief, because they use that in

4

support of their contention that de novo is a proper

5

standard of review, and perhaps I could address that for

6

just a moment.

7

It seems logical, and perhaps going back to what

8

Justice White was talking about, about the Fifth Circuit's

9

view of this, and just a great deal of discretion, but it

10

seems logical that if there is discretion to grant

11

declaratory relief, or to hear a declaratory judgment

12

case, then that should be reviewed on an abuse of

13

discretion standard.

14

But just in looking at the cases as they reach

15

the circuits and they apply a de novo review, they apply

16

that review to cases where the court did indeed hear a

17

declaratory judgment action and then the circuits reverse

18

on a de novo review of the granting of the declaratory

19

relief, and I think that's significant.

20

supports our position, because our position is that this

21

is a case in which -- and this type of case is a case in

22

which the court should not have granted and should at

23

least properly exercise its discretion and refuse to hear

24

the declaratory judgment relief request.

Of course, I would prefer

that it be abuse of discretion, because that's a more

liberal standard, and that would be more favorable.

that you're going to apply a more liberal standard to the

merits than you apply to the jurisdictional question?

13

MS. LIBERATO:

14

QUESTION:

Well --

It seems strange to me.

You know,

15

that the judge can decline to take the case entirely and

16

it's pretty much up to him, but if he takes the case and

finds no equity in issuing the declaratory judgment, we're

going to review that as an original matter, just as though

the question is for us and not for him.

QUESTION:

After the

In the State court proceedings, if

8

the insurer alleges that there was nondisclosure on the

discretion to hear the equitable claims for rescission

13

15

MS. LIBERATO:

QUESTION:

Does the trial judge in Texas often

exercise the discretion that way, or does he usually

submit all the issues to the jury?

1

Hittner did that to a degree in analyzing the Moses Cone

2

and Colorado River factors, to look at other things, like

3

the order in which jurisdiction was acquired and some of

4

the other factors that are found in other cases, but the

5

point is that if, in the exercise of its discretion, the

6

court doesn't fulfill the purposes of the Declaratory

7

Judgment Act, that relief, to provide relief to simplify

8

and to clarify issues, then that declaratory judgment is

9

not appropriate, and for these reasons -- yes.
QUESTION:

10

Before you wind up, I want to come

11

back to whether review is de novo or not.

12

it seems to me it is a concession for your side that it is

13

de novo on review of injunctions, or at least declaratory

14

judgments when they're issued on the merits, but the cases

15

that you rely on for that, aren't they - - if I understood

16

your discussion earlier, aren't they cases in which

17

declaratory judgment was issued?

18

MS. LIBERATO:

19

Yes, Your Honor.

You concede --

Yes, that's

correct.
QUESTION:

20

Don't you think it's a little bit

21

different if you decline to exercise your equitable

22

powers?

23

decline to issue an injunction as to the rigidity of the

24

review as opposed to when you issue the injunction, which

25

raises a lot of legal issues?

Might there not be a different rule, when you

1

MS. LIBERATO:

Well, it seems to be that in fact

2

that's a distinction that the circuit courts have made not

3

specifically but in fact.

4

QUESTION:

Well, I have a good deal of doubt

5

about whether the ordinary rule for review is de novo on

6

refusal to exercise equitable discretion.

7

it ought to be an abuse of discretion standard.

8

9

MS. LIBERATO:

It seems to me

Well, I agree with you, and that

is what the Fifth Circuit held in this case, but my point,

10

which I did not make very artfully, that in either event,

11

that the presumption is in favor of the court exercising

12

its jurisdiction, so I would believe that what the Fifth

13

Circuit did was correct and that the district court was

14

proper in issuing the stay.

15

QUESTION:

16

you have 3 minutes remaining.

Thank you, Ms. Liberato.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANN E. WEBB

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MS. WEBB:

Ms. Webb,

The first thing I'd like to comment

20

on is Ms. Liberato's pronunciation of utmost good faith.

21

On our side of the bench we say, uberrimae fidei, but

22

utmost good faith works just as well and it's a little bit

23

easier to follow.

QUESTION:

wonder?
We believe that,

6

since it doesn't say whether the loss arises in the United

7

States or whether the lawsuit arises in the United States,

8

it's ambiguous and it needs to be construed.

9

We believe the appropriate construction is to

10

give a consistent application regardless of where the loss

11

occurs, be it Korea, Australia, Singapore, Texas, Seattle,

12

any one of the States that has a water port.

13

The only consistent application is to apply the

14

law that is equivalent to the law of England, which is

15

Federal maritime law, and we don't believe that the

16

McCarran-Ferguson Act, and "the insurance regulation

17

belongs to the State," applies here, because the doctrine

18

of utmost good faith is a well-entrenched maritime good

19

doctrine, and it is not one of those cases where State

20

insurance law should fill the cracks.

21

I'd like to comment briefly about the district

22

court never - - about some of the points raised by

23

Ms. Liberato.

We're talking about the making of a policy

24

of insurance.

The place of the loss has nothing to do

25

with the making of the policy, and the policy itself says

the choice of law is English, and we believe that gets you

to maritime.

to do with the choice of law that should apply to the

formation of the policy.

The place of the loss in Korea has nothing

5

With regard to the several questions about the

standard of review, abstention doctrine is a question of

law, which is customarily reviewed de novo.

8

important that this type of decision be reviewed de novo

because of the comity and federalism concerns that are

We believe that both the decision whether or not

QUESTION:

1

So I guess, if I'm right about what

2

the review of the failure to issue a declaratory judgment

3

is, a district judge would always be wise to accept

4

jurisdiction and deny the declaratory judgment instead of

5

simply saying, I won't take jurisdiction.

could do it the same way the same day, but you're

better - -

MS. LIBERATO:

I mean, you

In terms of getting reversed, I

guess that's correct, but we believe that unless the

10

traditional concerns precluding a declaratory judgment

11

exist, the district court should maintain jurisdiction.
