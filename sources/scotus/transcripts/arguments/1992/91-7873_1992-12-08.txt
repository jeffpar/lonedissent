ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. PAYNE, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. PAYNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

5 years ago today, there was a robbery in

11

Jackson County of a Rax restaurant that gave rise to the

12

-- this case.

13

that out to me, but it is an interesting coincidence.

14
r

We'll hear argument

I'd like to note that my opponent pointed

On February 29, 1988, a complaint was issued by

15

the Jackson County sheriff's --or Jackson County

16

prosecutor that showed that the residence of the defendant

17

was the Fort Wayne, Indiana jail, and that's at the joint

18

appendix on page 2.

19

I don't have any specific references in the

20

joint appendix between that date and September 7 of 1988,

21

but on that day, my client, Mr. William Fex, signed a

22

request for disposition under the Interstate Agreement on

23

Detainers.

24
25

Between that date and September 26, 1988, there
is again something of a void, but that is the date on

which the prosecutor urges that they actually received the

2

request for distribution --or request for disposition of

3

the detainer, and that is the date that we will concede

4

that they actually received the request for disposition.

5

The question here is does the signing of the

6

request for disposition on September 7 or does the receipt

7

of the request for disposition trigger the 180-day

8

limitation on prosecution under the Interstate Agreement

9

on Detainers.

10

From the time that my client was sentenced in

11

Indiana until he was transferred to Michigan for

12

prosecution in this present case, he was effectively

13

prevented from participating in any rehabilitation at the

14

prison in Indiana.

And that is the problem.

That is the

injury here.
16
17
18

QUESTION:

Had he been going through such a

program prior to the installation of the request?
MR. PAYNE:

No, there wasn't any opportunity

19

because at the time that the complaint was issued - - and I

20

cannot believe that the Michigan prosecutor's office

21

didn't have some kind of communication with the Indiana

22

prosecutor's office and the court there.

MR. PAYNE:

2

Justice Scalia, I don't think that

3

the language of the statute is sufficiently clear.

4

have the statute which says that the prosecutor shall have

5

180 days after the prisoner shall have caused to be

6

delivered this request.
Now, you have three concepts.

7

We

One is that the

8

prisoner makes a demand.

Two is that the demand is

9

transmitted through his jailers, and three, that there's

10

180 days.

And I think that from a grammatical standpoint

11

or from a logical standpoint, the requirement of the 180

12

days will follow the other two requirements.

13

natural way that you would say this is that the prisoner

14

makes a demand.

15

there's 180 days that the prosecutor has to bring the

16

action.

He gives it to the jailer, and then

QUESTION:

I think it's a little different than

QUESTION:

Well, just say you're mailing a

letter paying a bill, and after the bill has been paid

3

somebody asked when did you cause that letter to be

delivered.

when you mailed it?

QUESTION:

MR. PAYNE:

QUESTION:

I would say when it was mailed.
Of course.
But I think that - What if you knew it never got there

10

and somebody asked you the same question, when did you

11

cause it to be delivered?

12

even though it was never delivered?

You would still say on March 7,

if the statute said sent, wouldn't it?

Yes, it would be, Justice.

QUESTION:

1

2

Isn't that a distinction we ought to

bear in mind?
MR. PAYNE:

3

Yes, and it still is not clear,

4

though, because normally you wouldn't ask somebody when

5

did you cause your light bill to be paid.

6

when did you send it or when was it received.
QUESTION:

7

You would say

But you couldn't say when did you

8

send it here because he doesn't send it, does he?

9

gives it to someone else to send it.
MR. PAYNE:

10
11

That's correct, and I would like to

point out - QUESTION:

12

And the statute doesn't say after it

13

was delivered, does it?

14

delivered.
MR. PAYNE:

15
16

It says after he caused it to be

That's correct, and the emphasis

should be on he, and it's on what he does.
QUESTION:

17

Don't we still have the problem that

18

he didn't cause it to be sent?

19

of his causing it to be sent.

causing it to be delivered.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Payne, you may

proceed with your argument.

5

MR. PAYNE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

Before the lunch break, we were -- I was asked a

7

question about shall have caused to be delivered, and the

8

only answer I have is that this is ultimately an ambiguous

9

way of phrasing the requirement.

When somebody is asking

10

whether or when a phone bill or a light bill was paid, the

11

question is when did you send it, and the answer, of

12

course, is on the day that it was put in the mail.

13

The Senate report to 91-1356 has a somewhat

14

different formulation in explaining the Interstate

15

Agreement on Detainers than the excerpt that - - on which

2

That's all right.

3

MR. PAYNE:

No.

Well, Justice, if you are accepting

4

a - - an offer of a contract, the offer of a contract is

5

accepted when it is put in the mail or when you have

6

delivered the offer to the agent of the -- or when you've

delivered your acceptance to the agent of the offeror.

10
11

QUESTION:

Or if you want to comply with our

time requirements, if you have a little verification that
you put it in the mail on time, you are in time.
MR. PAYNE:

That's correct, but the bottom line

12

here I think is that the prison authority is the agent of

13

the prosecutor.

14

And Mr. Schrotenboer urges that the prison

15

authorities have to have a certain amount of time in order

16

to respond to the request for disposition.

17

to suggest that they really don't.

18

this case, the certificate of inmate status was executed

19

on the same day that the inmate executed his request for

20

disposition, and even if they needed a day or two, they

21

could process that paperwork before they gave the request

22

for disposition to the prisoner so that it would be all

23

ready to go when he signed it.

and certainly they can disrupt the internal affairs of the

7

In any case, the prison -- the Moore case, which

8

is probably the primary case on which the respondent

9

relies, from the Supreme Court of Tennessee would hold

10

that, number one, the prisoner is responsible for ensuring

In Moore, it was 225 days, but the problem here is

that all of the time that the prisoner is under detainer,

he's unable to get favorable work assignments.

unable to get rehabilitative services.

the prosecutor certainly should know that they have done

paperwork is properly set up so that -- for example, you

20

have a one-write system in accounting or in docket

management -- if the prosecutor sets up its paperwork

would lose any more than possibly a few days when they

QUESTION:

You're talking about the Jackson

5

MR. PAYNE:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.
How does he have control over what

7

goes on in the Indiana prison?

8

MR. PAYNE:

9

He knows that the detainer has been

sent to the Indiana prison, and if he is keeping a log, he

10

knows when to expect the return of the request for

11

disposition.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, but that depends on the action

of the individual inmate, doesn't it?
MR. PAYNE:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

15

that if the inmate is going to sign the request for

16

disposition, he probably will do it immediately, and the

17

prosecutor could operate on the assumption that it's going

18

to come back and at least start the initial paperwork.

19

The alternative is that you say to the prison

20

officials, well, if you don't send it back, that's okay

because the prosecutor is not prejudiced by your failure

22

to return the request for disposition.

The attorney

General, as part of the legislative history in Senate

8

that the inmate may make a request for the disposition of

language would indicate that -- or treats the signing of

80 days starts after

the request for disposition and the transmittal by the

prison authorities as one event which triggers the

I'm asking that the Court affirm this particular

1

2

case.

Both the Michigan Supreme Court and the vast

3

majority of jurisdictions have correctly ruled that

4

article III, the Interstate Agreement on Detainers' 180-

5

day provision, begins with the actual receipt by the

6

prosecutor, and I'm asking you to rule the same

7

essentially for three reasons.
First, the language of the statute itself.

8

9

After all, this is a statutory interpretation case.

10

Secondly, the congressional history, and third, the actual

11

policy considerations, which actually favor respondent's

12

position, which favor the position of a vast majority of

13

jurisdictions.

14

The first is the statute's language itself.

15

This phrase -- the statute is not ambiguous.

16

that we're talking about here is shall have caused to be

17

delivered.

Your Honor.

First, it's in the future perfect tense.

If

that he handed it to him, it wouldn't be future perfect.

don't really care that much about actual receipt, they're

not going to get too much.

The phrase is not that ambiguous.

Yes, it was

QUESTION:

No.

And, therefore, it

is always asked at a period after the delivery has been

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

MR. SEAMON:

2

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to begin by addressing a question that

4

Justice Stevens posed to my colleague, which is whether

6

under our interpretation of article III(a) of the IAD, the

7

provision doesn't contain unnecessary language.

8

me.

9

Pardon

And my answer to that is no.
Now, Justice Stevens asked why the article

10

III(a) is not drafted so as to simply trigger the 180 days

11

after delivery of the prisoner's request.

12

suggest that the answer to that comes from the drafting

13

history, which we discuss in our brief beginning at page

14

21.

15

State Governments, which opposed the IAD in 1957, actually

16

proposed two State - - two agreement proposals at the same

17

time, one based on interstate detainers and one governing

18

intrastate detainers.

19

My -- I would

The drafters note -- pardon me -- the Council of

The speedy trial provisions in both proposals

20

were virtually identical, and the council noted that the

21

intrastate proposal was based on statutes then in effect

22

in California and Oregon.

23

statutes plainly required actual receipt for triggering of

24

the speedy trial provision.

change the actual receipt requirement.

2

differences between the State models on which the IAD was

3

based and the IAD itself is the wording requiring the

4

prisoner to have caused delivery of the required

5

documents.

6

requiring the prisoner to cause delivery.

7

The relevant

There are two reasons for that wording

First is the whole topic of article III is that

8

the prisoner has initiated the process of disposing of the

9

charges underlying the detainer.

The fact that the

10

prisoner has initiated the process is what distinguishes

11

article III from article IV, which deals with when the

12

State initiates the process of disposing of the charges.

QUESTION:

How does he initiate the process?

MR. SEAMON:

Article III(a) differs from the State proposals

statute which was an equally clear model for this under

your view I take it.

9
10

MR. SEAMON:

The Oregon statute revolved -- was

built around the verb receive.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SEAMON:

Right.
And we would suggest that the

13

problem with using the verb receive rather than the verb

14

deliver in article III is that then you would shift the

15

focus of article III to the prosecutor and the appropriate

16

courts receiving it.

17

the prisoner, and the prisoner has a vital role under

18

article III as opposed to article IV because he initiates

19

the process.

20

QUESTION:

That would shift the focus away from

Well, but that's precisely the shift

21

in focus which you say the drafters intended.

focused on the prisoner which would seem to focus on when

2

he caused it to be delivered.
MR. SEAMON:

3

I'm sorry.

I may have misspoken.

4

The scheme of article III focuses on the prisoner's having

5

initiated the process.

6

subject of the relevant clause we're talking about makes

7

sense in understanding why article III is different from

8

article IV of the IAD because article IV is directed at

9

the State.

10

And so, using the prisoner as the

And, of course, the other reason for using the

11

word cause in the relevant wording is that the prisoner

12

does not make an actual delivery directly to the court and

13

the prosecutor in the receiving State.

14

article III(c), he is required to give his request for

15

disposition to the wardens who are then required to

16

promptly forward it to the receiving State.

17

the causing language is in there.

Instead, under

That's why

And - - but the gist of article III is to require

19

a communication between the prisoner and the prosecutor in

20

the receiving State.

21

communication, namely, the prisoner's request for

22

disposition, has been completed that the prosecutor's duty

23

to bring the prisoner to trial in a speedy manner begins,

24

and that he cannot know of his duty to do so until he has

25

actually received the request for disposition.

And it is only when that

The other point about the relevant language of

1

2

article III I'd like to repeat is one that Justice Souter

3

raised, which is that the drafters could easily have

4

drafted article III(a) to trigger the 180-day period to

5

begin when the prisoner sent or gave his request for

6

disposition to the warden officials.

7

language of giving or sending is included in article

1

MR. SEAMON:

No, there are none.

2

I would note that under the Speedy Trial Act in

3

the Federal system, my answer would be different because

4

the Speedy Trial Act does give a Federal prosecutor a duty

5

to file the detainer if he knows that a prisoner, who has

6

been charged with a crime, is in a State.

7

itself does not.

But the IAD

8

And we recognize at the same time that States

9

have an interest in processing these requests speedily,

10

and in fact, that the prison officials have a duty -- and

11

we would suggest in most cases, they live up to that duty

12

-- of sending on the prisoner's paperwork promptly.

13

Nonetheless, the IAD itself does not contain a sanction

14

for addressing the situation in which a State does not

15

forward those documents promptly.

16

That doesn't mean there are no remedies.

Both

17

at the political level, the State --a State that has been

18

negligent in fulfilling its duty may well be subject to

19

political pressure from other States that are parties to

20

the IAD, and at an individual level, the prisoner himself

21

certainly has remedies by way of mandamus or the internal

22

grievance procedure that is present in all prison systems,

23

including the Federal system.

MR. SEAMON:

The Court construed the language of

effectively disastrous consequences for the prisoner in

No.

I'm talking about the detainer.

The detainer could be put on by a police department.

It seems to me the only State action

MR. PAYNE:

My understanding of the detainer --

now, the Court ruled -- has ruled that a probation

16

violation is not a detainer, and if I am not -- it's my

understanding -- now, I don't work for the prosecutor's

office, and I'm not completely up on how this paperwork is

21

It's only after the prosecutor's office issues a complaint

22

or an indictment or a detainer that we actually have a

document that is recognized under the IAD.

But it's my understanding that if we just have

And I ask the Court to rule in the only way that

does not eviscerate the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.

5

If you rule in favor of the petitioner, you have a bright

line test.

The problem of competing requests for detainer

can be dealt with in the way that the paperwork is

12

in a number of cases because when you have a prisoner

sending it himself, there are problems in proving when it

was sent and proving when it was received.

15

more difficult for the prosecutor to prove when the

16

prisoner tended the request for disposition to the prison

And I want to stress that we are talking about

20

the prisoner tendering the request for disposition to the

21

agent of the prosecutor who is initiating the detainer or

22

the complaint or the indictment.

23

he wants to do so, can exert perfect control over when the

kinds of records are kept in order to ensure that it's not
