GEN. DOYLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may ic

thought he wants to chink.

16

that thought in any legitimate manner.

17

violates the Wisconsin criminal code he subjects himself

18

to the punishment of the State of Wisconsin, and it is

19

perfectly appropriate for the State of Wisconsin through

20

its legislature and courts to consider his reason for

21

committing the crime in determining what the appropriate

22

sentence should be.

It punishes criminal

very legitimate state interests.

conduct and assesses the appropriate penalty range for a

4

particular type of crime, and it addresses the harmful

5

effects of discriminatory conduct.
Nobody suggests that Wisconsin's interest in

dealing with the harmful effects of discriminatory

criminal conduct are not substantial.

this country have adopted laws of some sort attempting to

QUESTION:

General Doyle, your state supreme

12

court was of the opposite view.

13

court said that in fact this, or in law, I don't know

14

which, this statute does control thought.

Now, are we

15

bound by -- it's after all their statute.

It's not ours.

16

Are we bound by their determination as to what it is

17

directed at?

18

GEN. DOYLE:

I mean your state supreme

It is our view that the Supreme

19

Court of Wisconsin decided in law that the Wisconsin

20

statute punished thought.

21

kind of statutory construction, there was no issue about

22

the meaning of a particular word, there was no discussion

23

of legislative history, there was no ambiguity in the

24

statute.

25

that the statute punishes thought.

They did not go through any

They came to a conclusion in which they declared
That is a, in my

1

judgment a conclusory constitutional statement.

2

that's the same as saying it violates the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

3

In fact

But if some other state supreme court

4

came to the same disposition that your state supreme court

5

but used legislative history and decided as a factual

6

matter that it had been intended to punish thought, then

7

we would have to come out differently in your view?

8

9

GEN. DOYLE:
analysis was.

It very much depends on what the

If it turns on the meaning of a phrase, if

10

it turns on the meaning of what particular language means,

11

I think you would have to respect the decisions of the

12

state supreme court with respect to what the language is

13

on the statute.

14

practical effect in First Amendment terms is of a

15

particular kind of statute, and balanced against First

16

Amendment standards, then I think that you may, that

17

that's a First Amendment question that this Court may

18

consider.

19

But when you are dealing with what the

QUESTION:

You, in other words you're saying

20

that their comments were directed to the First Amendment

21

consequences of this statute?

22

GEN. DOYLE:

Yes, Your Honor.

And in fact in

23

reading that opinion it's quite clear that they not only

24

looked at the Wisconsin statute, they in fact declared

25

what hate crime, as they declared it, hate crime statutes

1

in general what the First Amendment consequences were.

2

They looked at the model ADL statute for example and

3

declared what these kinds of, what these kinds of laws

4

mean in First Amendment terms.

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's on page A8 and A9 of the

6

Appendix.

The discussion of the model statute is right

7

after the comment that Justice Scalia has in mind, I

8

think, because the state court does say without doubt the

9

hate crime statute punishes bigoted thought.

And the

10

state asserts the statute punishes only conduct.

11

disagree.

12

that's binding on us.

13

GEN. DOYLE:

We

That does sound like a state law conclusion
It's certainly questionable.
Your Honor, I believe that that is

14

their conclusion, that they then lead into their reasons.

15

They then go to the ADL statute and then at page 37 of the

16

Appendix, the Joint Appendix and their opinion, they say

17

that the Wisconsin statute, based on the history of these

18

anti-biased statutes, plural, looking at anti-biased

19

statutes in general punish bigoted bias.

20

that the Wisconsin Supreme Court was taking a very broad

21

look at what it, at a genre of laws that it labeled hate

22

crimes.

23

QUESTION:

So I believe

Well, ordinarily we decide what a

24

statute is directed at by the terms of the statute itself,

25

I take it, don't we?

('?()'?) 289-2260

GEN. DOYLE:

1

Well, that's correct, Your Honor.

2

I believe what the Wisconsin Supreme Court has not put

3

into its opinion and that I would ask this Court to look

4

at directly are the terms of the Wisconsin statute.

5

terms of the Wisconsin statute, for example with respect

6

to what is punished, states very clearly that the

7

penalties for the underlying crime will be enhanced.

8

is the punishment for the underlying crime that is being

9

enhanced by this.

The

It

So on the face of the Wisconsin statute we have

10
11

a statute that is punishing the criminal conduct of Todd

12

Mitchell, not some abstract thought that he may have

13

engaged in.
QUESTION:

14

I take it you make no distinction

15

between, or do you, a statute which simply enhances a

16

sentence for this kind of conduct and a hypothetical

17

statute say in another state which makes this a

18

substantive crime of, in a free-standing statute.

19

it there would be no difference, or would there?
GEN. DOYLE:

20

I take

I believe there is no

21

constitutional difference, although let me add I think the

22

Wisconsin case is even cleaner than the second one that

23

you gave, that because in order to get into the enhanced

24

punishment - - we have not tried to create any type of new

25

crime.

problems that some other attempts at this, some other

states may have attempted of trying to define some new

kind of offense.

7

So we don't run into some of the

We have dealt with this strictly as a

Let me say that I believe that the state's

8

interest in dealing with these problems is evidenced by

9

the facts of this case itself.

Todd Mitchell participated

10

in the brutal beating of a 14-year old boy walking down

11

the street of his home town in Kenosha, and the facts of

12

this case are very clear that that young 14-year old boy

13

would never have been beaten except for his race.

14

This case, Wisconsin's statute was in place,

15

fortunately, which quite directly dealt with that kind of

16

criminal conduct.

17

legislature assessed the kind of, had determined the

18

appropriate sentencing range and the judge assessed the

19

proper sentence for the criminal conduct that was involved

20

in this case.

It assessed the, the Wisconsin

QUESTION:

21

I would guess in most cases you're

22

not going to get nearly as clear of an evidentiary finding

23

as you did in this as to the motive for the crime?

24
25

GEN. DOYLE:
so clear.

It is likely you would not find one

This is obviously a very clear case.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

But let

1

me say Wisconsin is, again has afforded the defendant an

2

added protection that I don't think even Dawson would

3

require, for example, which is the factual basis that he

4

intentionally selected the victim because of the victim's

5

race must be there and it must be proven by the prosecutor

6

beyond a reasonable doubt.

7

So the defendant in this case, this is not

8

simply a judge saying that I have heard the evidence and I

9

believe based on the evidence that there was a motive that

10

I am going to impose a higher sentence than I would

11

normally impose.

12

the prosecutor beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim

13

was selected because of the victim's race.

14
15
16

This is a finding by a jury, proven by

QUESTION:

Is that submitted to the jury at the

same time that the substantive criminal offense is tried?
GEN. DOYLE:

Yes, it is.

The jury is given a

17

special verdict under the Wisconsin penalty enhancement

18

statute and it is, they return two verdicts, guilt or

19

innocence on the charge and as well as the question on

20

whether or not the defendant intentionally selected the

21

victim because of the victim's race, or whatever the

22

particular status may be in the case.

23

And it is that point, I believe, that is

24

extremely important in this case.

statute does is look at the intentional selection of the

thought, and so on.

3

after biased thought or hate thought.

4

whether Mr. Mitchell had racial bias or not.

5

he did given the facts of the case, but we don't know.

6

And to a large measure in Wisconsin we don't care.

7

There is a lot of talk about biased thought, hate
The Wisconsin statute does not go
We don't know
It's likely

For example, Mr. Mitchell might have selected

8

that victim because of his race simply to show off to the

9

group of young men that was around him about how tough he

10

was or some other reason.

We don't know.

Mr. Mitchell

11

may have the benignest thoughts about race relations as

12

are possible, and yet he would be guilty under the

13

Wisconsin law because he intentionally selected the victim

14

because of the victim's race.

15

QUESTION:

Is there any limit on the reasons for

16

selection that the state can specify for higher

17

punishment?

18

on the basis of whether or not he believes in the hole in

19

the ozone layer?

20

believes that the earth revolves around the sun rather

21

than vice-versa?

22

I mean, could it say if you select a victim

Could you do that?

GEN. DOYLE:

Or whether he

I believe that in view of the state

23

if the particular category serves a legitimate state

24

interest and meets equal protection tests and meets

25

vagueness -- some of the examples you have given, Justice

Scalia, I think would be difficult obviously to put into a

2

statute that would meet the vagueness test.

3

meets those, that -QUESTION:

4
5

But if it

It has to serve a legitimate state

interest?

6

GEN. DOYLE:

7

QUESTION:

I believe that -So one has to judge whether being

8

against flat earth people is less important than being

9

against people who don't like particular religions, for

10

example?

11

GEN. DOYLE:

No, that would not be the

12

legitimate state interest.

13

is if, for example, you have had a problem in your state,

14

there is a large debate going on about flat or round earth

15

and there have been a great number of fights that have

16

gone on in your state for a period of time and the state

17

legislature decides that the violence attached to this

18

debate is one that needs to be addressed and that people

19

who are acting out of, who are selecting victims because

20

of that reason present a particular danger to the

21

community, then I think the state could act.

22

QUESTION:

Okay.

The legitimate state interest

So it isn't the goodness or

23

badness of the idea that you're talking about, it's

24

whether attacks on the basis of that idea are a particular

problem?

GEN. DOYLE:

I believe there are some categories

that should very clearly raise a concern in the court, in

6

courts on whether or not there is suppression of ideas

that are afoot.

mentioned opposition to a Government policy would be such

QUESTION:

Is it a question of proximity, how

proximate is the conduct to the thought?
GEN. DOYLE:

Yes, I think certainly it is.

I

4

think for example if you had a statute that said all drunk

5

drivers who are racist will receive an extra year in

6

prison, I think under Dawson quite clearly that would be a

7

violation of the First Amendment.

8

statute has been drafted very carefully to create that

9

nexus with the term because of.

And again Wisconsin

Not only is the nexus

10

there, but in Wisconsin it has to be proven beyond a

11

reasonable doubt in order for the enhancer to apply.

12

QUESTION:

Does the difference between the draft

13

card burning enhancement and the enhancement here rest on

14

the fact that no one burns draft cards except as, in

15

effect as political statements, whereas people do commit

16

assaults for different reasons?

17

justification in, as it were, in an increased deterrence

18

in the draft card case, and therefore the only purpose

19

that's being served by the draft card enhancement is

20

simply kind of an extra punishment of the thought?

21

GEN. DOYLE:

So that there is no

I believe that that is correct in

22

the draft card, particularly when you're dealing with the

23

motive being opposition to a Government policy.

24

in that case the court should consider whether there is

25

Government suppression of ideas afoot and should consider

I think

1

whether there's a legitimate state interest in the

articulate a legitimate state interest in choosing one

side of the debate.

And I think it would be very difficult to

The better analogy to the Wisconsin - -

6

QUESTION:

But, excuse me, I thought we were

7

presenting from that whether the objectives are good or

8

bad, but you say the objectives have to be a legitimate

9

state interest?

See, I thought from your initial answer

10

to Justice Souter that you would have said, or I gathered

11

from Justice Souter's question that it's a different case
if you say you get an enhanced penalty for assault if the

16

)

i1

I would say that that would, it's

17

far removed from the Wisconsin example, but I think that

18

it would present to the court a legitimate concern that

19

the Government is attempting to suppress ideas of the

20

Government.

21

1

GEN. DOYLE:

The analogy that is closer to the Wisconsin is

22

if you say there is an assault and the reason for the

23

assault is because of beliefs about the war, without

24

choosing one side or the other, would serve the state

25

purpose that because of increased criminal activity that

may come, without any suggestion that the state is taking

2

one side or another in a particular political debate.

3

Let me, if I might follow up on that, I want to

be clear that in my judgment I do not believe the state is

taking sides in this.

We are -- if there were an

10

based on the evidence I have seen I see that you were, you

11

moved only because of the victim and I think you present a

12

greater danger to the community because of that, I think

13

that that would be perfectly appropriate.

14

QUESTION:

In this case --

What if in the draft card case the

15

statute said that your penalty would be enhanced if you

16

did it because of disagreement with the person's views

17

about the Vietnam war, whether they were pro or con?

18

GEN. DOYLE:

In my view that would, assuming

19

that there is in fact, as there was, a real disruption, I

20

think that that would be constitutional.

I would like, if there are no further questions

UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. DREEBEN:

2

3

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Wisconsin's sentence enhancement provision is

4
5

valid under two lines of this Court's cases.

First,

6

Government may combat discrimination in crime just as it

7

combats discrimination in other contexts by punishing the

8

conduct that is motivated by the race, religion, or other

9

status of the victim.

It is settled that such anti-

10

discrimination provisions do not infringe First Amendment

11

rights.

12

Secondly - -

13

QUESTION:

You have to be an equal opportunity

14

criminal?

15

not being indiscriminantly violent?

Is that it?

MR. DREEBEN:

16

You're punishing the person for

No, Justice Scalia.

What's being

17

punished by a race-motivated crime or a crime that's

18

motivated by the status of the victim are the particular

19

harms that flow to victims as a result of that kind of

inflicted by status-based crime that justify the

increased sanction and increased deterrence.
QUESTION:

6

So what we have is a crime that

7

itself presents a substantive evil that the state can

8

prevent quite without regard to the thoughts and beliefs

9

of the actor?
MR. DREEBEN:

10

That's exactly right, Justice

11

Kennedy.

12

has to make when confronted with a law like this and

13

there's an allegation that the state is in some sense

14

punishing motive or thought is whether the law is

15

justified by reasons that relate to free expression and

16

free thought or whether it's justified by purposes that

17

the state does have a legitimate interest in suppressing,

18

wholly apart from punishing belief.

19

And I think that the key inquiry that the court

And the Court has made that inquiry in many

20

different contexts whenever it confronts a law that

21

regulates on its face conduct and there's a claim that

22

there's some sort of expressive component underlying it.

23

The inquiry has to be made by looking at the text, the

24

history, the application of the law by the state, and the

25

interests that are asserted by the state.

MR. DREEBEN:

6

QUESTION:

The state cannot suppress

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

What the state can do is to foster

7

the opposite, to show its disapproval of that attitude.

8

It's entitled to do that, right, in statements by the

9

President, in pronouncements by the Congress?

MR. DREEBEN:

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

Those are --

So can you punish a crime more

severely if the crime demonstrates a lack of patriotism?
MR. DREEBEN:

No.

I think the entire point that

17

I'm trying to make in this area is that if the interest of

18

the Government is to regulate conduct, regulate thought

19

and speech per se for its own sake, then that is not a

20

legitimate interest.

21

speaking of in Dawson v. Delaware when it held that the

22

Government may not punish in the abstract the holding of a

23

particular belief or the holding of a particular idea.

24

What it may do is address the harms that flow from the

25

conduct that is bound up with status-motivated crime.

That's exactly what the Court was

6

I acknowledge that if the court

determined that the law's purpose and effect is really to

manifesting the harms in question, then you have a

10

different case.

11

that the Court undertook in the Barnes v. Glen Theatre

really aimed at expression.

The

citizens.

There can be no doubt that in this country

there is a genuine problem with status-motivated crime
that affects the injuries to victims and the intimidation
in the exercise of rights that Federal law has long
reached out in an attempt to regulate.
QUESTION:

What if a state which had no history

whatsoever of any race-motivated crimes, there simply had
never been any in that state, what if that state were to
pass a statute like Wisconsin's?

Would it be subject to

any additional scrutiny than Wisconsin's is?
MR. DREEBEN:

In the particular area that this

law deals with I don't think there would be any additional
scrutiny because the nation has experienced such problems
in this area that it cannot be, there can be no doubt
whatsoever that the state's motivation in enacting such a
law is real and legitimate.
QUESTION:

Disability?

Have we had a rash of

people going around beating up on the handicapped?

I'm

not aware that that's -- I mean, I can understand the
other things, religion, race, yes, sexual orientation,
national origin or ancestry, but not disability.
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think of all the

categories that are in the list the category of disability
is one that is most easy to understand, that the disabled
status of a victim may make that victim more vulnerable to

But is there any evidence that

4

disabled people have been beaten up because they are

5

disabled?

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't know that there is any

7

evidence in this record.

8

Federal policy reflected in the anti-discrimination laws.

9

QUESTION:

There is clearly evidence in

Yes, but I thought your argument was

10

that, in response to Justice Kennedy's question, if there

11

are a rash of church burnings, sure, the state, the

12

Federal Government can come in and legislate about that.

13

But here we're talking about a situation where there

14

hasn't been a rash of anything so far as anybody knows, so

15

far as attacks on the disabled because they are disabled.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

It may be evidenced in a

particular case that there is no real-life problem that

18

the state is attempting to regulate, that the state has

some other goal in mind.

8

Those things would raise greater

The theory of the Wisconsin Supreme Court that

9

simply because the underlying crime is already punished

10

the enhancement must be directed at thought is a theory

11

that if accepted is broad enough to invalidate this

12

nation's anti-discrimination laws.

13

laws that deal with anti-discrimination look to the motive

14

of the actor in assessing whether the conduct is in fact

15

the sort of discrimination that's meant to be prohibited.

16

All of the Federal

This Court noted that as recently as yesterday's

17

opinion in the Hazen Paper Company case, that it is the

18

motive of the actor that is the focus of the law and

without an impermissible motive the conduct in question is

not regulated.

upholding the constitutionality of those laws that simply

because motive is an element does not mean that it is

there is no indication whatsoever that the underlying goal

5

here of the Wisconsin legislature is somehow to punish

speech or thought for itself.

7

Unlike the law that this Court had before it in

R.A.V., Wisconsin is not regulating speech in any form or

That's correct.

If you look at

the Wisconsin Supreme Court, if you look at every single
application to date of this crime.

It's after all,

Justice Stevens, it's called a hate crime statute, and
that's what it's directed at.

It punishes hate.

punishes crimes which are committed which, with a certain
mind set and certain animus which is in this particular

belief system about a particular public matter.

crude belief system, certainly, but it nevertheless is a
viewpoint.
QUESTION:

Perhaps I'm wrong, counsel.

On A8

again of the Appendix it is true that the state court say
without doubt the hate crime statute punishes bigoted
thought, but it seems to me that that isn't all it
punishes.

It says

because the hate crime statute punishes the defendant's
biased thought as discussed below and thus encroaches on
First Amendment rights, the burden is on the state to
prove constitutionality.

Clearly the Wisconsin Supreme

now that's in effect in Wisconsin covers because of in
whole or in part, which means you can have an unconscious
amount of racism, the most minute percentage of
disapproved or disfavored motive, and still be subject to
this additional penalty.

It's clear what the state is

doing here is that they were searching out to find bias
wherever they could find it, even in minute qualities.
The statute also covers not just violent crimes,
but it covers every crime in the whole Wisconsin criminal
code, including such minor offenses as mooring a water
craft to the wrong pier.
