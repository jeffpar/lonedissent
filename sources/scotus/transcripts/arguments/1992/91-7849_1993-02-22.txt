CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE F. TAYLOR, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. TAYLOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court has repeatedly held in conformance

13

with common law that absolute immunity to public officials

14

is exceedingly rare under section 1983.

15

presents the question of whether prosecutors who direct

16

and participate in a yearlong prearrest and preindictment

17

investigation, who participate in manufacturing bootprint

18

evidence, in interrogating witnesses, and in conducting a

19

prejudicial publicity campaign, which includes a

20

postindictment press conference which strayed far beyond

21

the announcement of that particular indictment, whether

22

those particular functions and acts by a prosecutor should

23

be afforded such immunity.

24
25

prior decisions in Imbler, in Burns, and also in Harlow

particularly dictate that such absolute prosecutorial

2

immunity should not be afforded for these particular acts

3

of these respondents.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Taylor, does acceptance -- would

5

acceptance of your position require that we cut back at

6

all on the opinion --on our decision in the Imbler case?

7

MR. TAYLOR:

No.

We have raised the question in

8

a final point in our briefs in terms of limiting Imbler,

9

but that only goes to the malicious prosecution aspect of

10

our case.

In terms of the acts that I just outlined, it

11

would not in any way cause a limitation on the holding in

12

Imbler.

13

Common law, with regard to this particular set

14

of acts and prosecutors and quasi-judicial immunity does

15

not support the grant of absolute immunity here.

16

take it as narrowly or as broadly as one might want to.

17

Narrowly, you look at these acts and you see whether

18

common law prior to and at 1871, which is, of course, when

19

the statute was passed, when we have to look at it, that

20

there was no exception for prosecutors or anyone else for

21

these kinds of acts.

22

QUESTION:

You can

There was also no cause of action.

23

Was there a cause of action at common law for fabricating

24

evidence that is never used?

25

MR. TAYLOR:

Not a cause of action, but in terms

1

of the allegations here, in terms of false arrest,

2

malicious prosecution, yes, there definitely were.

3

that's what I mean in terms of as broadly or as narrowly.

4

QUESTION:

Now, wait.

The malicious prosecution

5

certainly is - - you're not saying that the act of

6

prosecuting is not covered by the immunity, are you?

7

MR. TAYLOR:

No.

And

We're not saying that the act

8

of prosecuting.

9

disparate -- if you look at the function of the acts that

10

We're saying if you look at this as

are in question here -QUESTION:

11

I'm saying that if you take them

12

apart, there isn't any liability if -- unless it leads up

13

to the prosecution.

14

piece of evidence which is never used in a prosecution --

15
16

The mere fact that you fabricate a

there's no harm done, is there?

I can fabricate as much

evidence as I want if it's never used in a prosecution.

17

MR. TAYLOR:

That's true in some ways, but on

18

the other sense of it, the fact that the evidence was

19

fabricated and then is introduced later time into this

20

judicial process and causes injury should not be

21

determinative of whether there's immunity because -QUESTION:

22

Isn't it the introduction that causes

23

the harm.

The point at which your client is harmed is

24

when fabricated evidence is introduced against him at

25

trial.

1

MR. TAYLOR:

That's where the harm

that's

2

where the injury takes place, but that isn't the analysis

3

that necessarily follows in terms of determining whether

4

the function that the particular police officer or the

5

function that the particular prosecutor did in order to

6

lead you to that introduction.

7

There is a distinction that can be made and

8

should be made between the act and has been made both in

9

Imbler and subsequently in Burns between certain acts that

10

a prosecutor commits which are outside that penumbra of

11

acts which are covered by prosecutorial immunity because

12

they are not integrally associated with the judicial phase

13

of the criminal process.

14

And so, in that sense, we're dealing not only

15

with common law, but we're dealing with the holdings in

16

Imbler, as well as policy considerations which lead to the

17

conclusion that these particular acts are not the kinds of

18

acts that were either covered under common law, are

19

supported either by the policy of 1983 or the policy to

20

protect prosecutors for those acts that are intimately

21

associated - -

22

QUESTION:

Well, don't we have to, first of all,

23

decide whether you've stated a claim in order to address

24

the immunity issue?

25

MR. TAYLOR:

Well, the Government -6

QUESTION:

1
2

Isn't that part and parcel of the

analysis?

3

MR. TAYLOR:

Well, the Government raised that in

4

its amicus for the first time.

5

as to the narrow question of the press conference and

6

whether the press conference and the claim that flows or

7

claims that flow from the press conference, in fact, raise

8

a constitutional claim.

9

it and, in fact, concede in their brief that there is a

It has never -- and only

The respondents have never raised

constitutional claim here, a fair trial claim.

11

been no question with regard to any of the other

12

allegations, whether in fact there are constitutional

13

claims.

14

There has

Nobody - QUESTION:

Well, I'm just asking you whether, as

15

a matter of procedure, when a claim is made, whether the

16

Court doesn't have to first decide whether a claim has

17

actually been stated or not.

18

analytically?

19

MR. TAYLOR:

Don't we have to do that

For qualified immunity, it becomes

20

a much closer question as the Siegert case raises because

21

to decide whether a claim is clearly established, you have

22

to decide whether there's a claim in terms of a

23

constitutional violation.

25

Here they are separate issues.

below, if, in fact, they concede it, as they do here, I

2

don't think it's within the Court's purview to take it on.
However, if it does, we're confident that the

3
4

Court would find that we do -- have made several

5

interrelated claims not only with regard to the

6

investigative acts, such as the fabrication of the

7

bootprint evidence and the coercive statements, but also

8

with regard to the prejudicial publicity claim that the

9

Government has challenged.
QUESTION:

10

May I ask you whether the pretrial

11

publicity issue was raised in the State criminal trial

12

ever?

Was that raised?
MR. TAYLOR:

13

Yes, it was.

It was raised in the

14

State criminal trial on a motion for change of venue,

15

among other things.

16

QUESTION:

17

And was that resolved against the

defendant?
MR. TAYLOR:

18

It's interesting.

In this

19

particular case, it was resolved against the defendant.

20

In subsequent cases when his codefendants were retried,

21

venue was shifted, which is - QUESTION:

Allen against McCurdy?
MR. TAYLOR:

2

I don't believe so because the

3

question here, we're dealing with both a substantive and a

4

procedural due process violation.

5

dealing with a procedural due process violation in a fair

6

trial determination, I suppose that's a similar kind of

7

question as to whether Parratt v. Taylor applies, which

8

the Government has also raised.

Insofar as you're

I don't think that you can apply Parratt v.

9
10

Taylor here when it is a State action and it is action by

11

responsible officials, including someone who has conceded

12

to be a policymaker for the county who is committing those

13

acts.

14

In other words, he's subverting the due process.
QUESTION:

Well, to the extent that you're

15

relying on procedural due process, are you -- is that not

16

barred at present?

MR. TAYLOR:

No.

I don't believe so.

By the

determination of the venue?
QUESTION:

By the determination of the pretrial

publicity claim made in -- at the trial.
MR. TAYLOR:

No, because the nature of what

22

we're saying is that the process was infected by the

23

publicity so that, therefore, the -- what the -- what he

24

was deprived of, among other things, was an impartial

decisionmaker.

QUESTION:

Wasn't that precisely the issue that

2

the judge determined against you in the criminal

3

proceeding?

4

MR. TAYLOR:

Well, I -- you know, not being

5

totally familiar with the change of venue motion and the

6

record on that, I can't say for sure, but if in fact the

7

venue motion was denied, he himself -- what we're saying

8

is that the process including the judge was influenced by

9

the prejudice and, therefore, both in the bond hearing and

10

in the trial situation so that, therefore, the effect --

11

and you have to take our allegations as true at this point

12

that the publicity infected the process, so that I don't

13

see how it could be res judicata in terms of whether it

14

was a fair trial.

15

The judge determined as an initial --

QUESTION:

Mr. Taylor, you're not entitled to

16

process -- to fair process and you're not entitled to a

17

fair trial.

18

liberty, or property without a fair trial --

You are entitled not to be deprived of life,

QUESTION:

And what

21

this decision held was that there was no effect on the

MR. TAYLOR:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. TAYLOR:

Well, that's ---on the basis of unfair process.
That's true, and in this case, I

10

mean, I want to make a distinction, as I did earlier,

11

between the claims that underlie all but the publicity.

12

And then as we focus on the publicity, however, our claim

13

does include that deprivation of life, liberty, or --

14

particularly liberty, 3 years of liberty.

15

substantive due process claim in the sense that it's

16

arbitrary governmental action in the actions of the

17

prosecutors that, in fact, regardless of the procedures,

MR. TAYLOR:

takes that and goes with his police associates and goes

10

and gets an arrest warrant and arrests my client?

11

the injury starts to accrue at that point.

12

Then

Should there be any difference in terms of the

13

act that he performs in filing that down if he goes and

14

gets an arrest warrant, or if he goes to a grand jury and

15

indicts, or if he gives it to another prosecutor and says,

16

here, put this into evidence, or if it's a police officer,

17

he carries it over and he then gives it to the prosecutor?

constitutional violation in which he has participated?

claim.
QUESTION:

2

3

And what is the substantive due

process claim?

4

MR. TAYLOR:

It's the claim of the 3 years of

5

deprivation of liberty without due process by the

6

arbitrary acts of government officials.

7

QUESTION:

Why isn't that a procedural due

8

process claim, that you were deprived of liberty without

9

due process of law?
MR. TAYLOR:

10

Well, because even if you were

11

given procedures here,

12

good enough job of manufacturing evidence,

13

arbitrary and shocks-the-conscience type of activity that

14

regardless of whether you have the procedures or not,

15

there's going to be a violation if there is a substantial

16

violation of liberty interest --

17
18

QUESTION:

it's such an

This is the Rouchon against

California Ball Park that you're talking about?

if someone does a good job -- a

MR. TAYLOR:

Well,

I'm talking about Rouchon.

I'm talking about --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. TAYLOR:

It's a rather small ball park.
Well, if you look at Zinneman v.

23

Birch,

24

Daniels v. Williams, they all set forward -- forth that

25

liberty interest as a substantive due process interest.

if you carry it through to that point and you carry

1

But it is also a procedural due process interest, and it's

2

also a Fourth Amendment search and seizure arrest,

3

specifically, interest because there's no probable cause,

4

that the probable cause was fabricated by the

5

investigative acts of the prosecutor.
I think that what the court of appeals did in

6

7

determining by the injury and working backwards and

8

saying, well, if the injury happened in the judicial

9

process, ipso facto, no liability for the prosecutor, in

10

fact, broadly extended prosecutorial immunity, and was

11

equating -- if we look now at the substance of the test

12

that's found in Imbler, which is intimately associated

13

with the judicial phase of the criminal process, what the

14

court of appeals did was say, well, if it flowed from

15

injury in the judicial process, then ipso facto, it's an

16

act -- it came from an act that was intimately associated

17

with the judicial phase.

18

QUESTION:

Well, on your reading of Imbler, as I

19

understand it, the only prosecutor who would retain

20

absolute immunity for what he introduced in the course of

21

the trial would be one who had had no role whatsoever in

22

supervising the gathering of evidence.

23

be the prosecutor who arrived at the courthouse on the day

24

or trial and said to his witnesses, well, what have you

25

got.

It would have to

MR. TAYLOR:

2

QUESTION:

No, that's not -He'd have an Imbler immunity, but I

3

don't see how anyone else would.

4

MR. TAYLOR:

No, that's not our position as to

5

the major acts in this case.

6

that, based on common law and the concurrence of Justice

7

Scalia in Burns, that Imbler could -- should be limited.

8

But that isn't crucial to the acts that I laid

9

out.

We did take the position

Those acts you turn to and look at the nature of

10

those, and there are four or five -- put flesh -- four or

11

five things that put flesh on that intimately associated

12

with the judicial phase of the criminal process.

13

at timeliness.

14

from either the arrest or the indictment.

You look at how far removed it is in time

QUESTION:

15

You look

So, I mean, are you thinking of

16

something as basic as whether the prosecutor gets in on

17

the investigation the day after the murder or only 1 week

18

before trial?

19

like that?

20

I mean, are you suggesting a distinction

MR. TAYLOR:

I'm suggesting that's one of

21

several factors that the courts, and particularly this

22

Court, has looked at in suggesting when the act is one

23

which is to be covered by prosecutorial immunity or not.

24

Other factors are such as how actively -- was it a

25

obtaining of evidence.

Was it going out and getting that

that it's primarily premised on the defamation immunity,

MR. TAYLOR:

Under Imbler, if you're going to

say he's immune, you'd have to say no, but if the act is

I'd like to

Your Honors, we simply ask the Court to apply a

19

rule which immunizes, accords absolute immunity to

20

prosecutors who are accused of engaging in out-of-court

21

investigation which culminates in constitutional wrongs

22

only as a result of the decision to prosecute and to

present evidence to judicial bodies.

immunity.

We believe that the distinction can be drawn in

2

a given case, in particular in this case, by simply

3

focusing on the prosecutorial function to be inhibited or

4

deterred if the suit is allowed to proceed and immunity is

5

withheld.

6

readily that the petitioner's claims arising from the

7

investigation are solely based upon the prosecutor's

decision to present testimony to the grand jury and again

There would be a distinction in that case.

6

We are not claiming that the prosecutor again

has immunity for the act of manufacturing the evidence.

8

It is his decision to introduce the evidence into the

9

process.
Now, under this Court's functional approach,

10
11

it's often said that we have to focus on the act and not

12

the actor.

13

because the key to the functional approach really is to

14

focus on the nature of the prosecutorial function to be

15

deterred if the suit is allowed to proceed.

16

And that's true, but it can be misleading

QUESTION:

Well, but there are two acts.

17

There's the act of introduction, and there's the act of

fabrication.

separately for that separate act, why shouldn't you be

20

able to get the prosecutor separately for that separate

21

act?

22

Just as you can get the arresting officer

Because the prosecutor has to be

23

protected from exposure to liability in that earlier act

introducing that information into the process.

This Court

1

actually addressed that distinction in Malley where the

2

police officer sought to analogize his position in seeking

an arrest warrant to a prosecutor's efforts to obtaining a

4

warrant -- to obtain an indictment.

5

This Court specifically rejected that analogy

6

and stated that to expose the prosecutor to liability for

7

even the initial phase of his prosecutorial work could

8

interfere with his exercise of independent judgment at

9

every phase of his work so that the prosecutor might come

10

to see later decisions in terms of their effect on his

11

potential liability.

that the petitioner seeks to use the announcement of the

claim.

5

this Court has given prosecutors absolute immunity from

1

That's correct.

2

Let me give the Court a specific example of how

3

allowing this press conference claim or this unfair trial

4

claim to go forward would interfere with the prosecutor's

5

decisions in the future.

6

In a high profile, highly charged case like

7

this, a criminal defendant's motion to transfer venue is a

8

typical and a common occurrence in a criminal trial.

9

the time that motion is made, that prosecutor has to

At

10

decide whether to oppose that motion or to concede to a

11

transfer to a different venue, and that decision is

12

supposed to be made based upon his independent evaluation

13

as to the extent to which the publicity has infected the

14

trial process.

15

If immunity were withheld, when the prosecutor

16

was sitting down to make that decision, he would be more

17

inclined to just concede to a transfer because of a fear

18

that if he successfully opposed the motion, but didn't win

19

the trial, that he could be sued for deprivation of a fair

20

trial for opposing the motion.

21

And when you really look at this claim, that's

22

what the petitioner is doing here.

He's suing the

23

prosecutor for opposing his motion to transfer venue at

24

the criminal trial.

MR. SOTOS:

We do support the reasoning of the

what the Seventh Circuit was doing was just coming up with

a convenient method of applying the functional approach,

Prosecutors are assigned by statute with the

To the extent that a prosecutor would solely

I would like to turn first to petitioner's

1

contention that the prosecutors are subject to a section

1983 damages action based on the preindictment activities,

4

such as evaluation of the evidence and selection of expert

5

witnesses.
This Court's decision in Imbler squarely holds

6

7

that a prosecutor is immune for actions taken in

8

initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State's

9

case.

The prosecutor's preindictment actions in

10

evaluating the evidence is part of that process.

11

his evaluation is an essential step in determining whether

12

to bring a prosecution.

13

cannot be sued on the basis of his review of the evidence

14

and selection of expert witnesses where the only injury

15

the plaintiff alleges is the commencement of a criminal

prosecution.

As the court of appeals put it, it would be a

hoax to proclaim immunity for presentation of testimony.

3

In court the person aggrieved by that testimony may attack

its preparation.

Immunity is not limited to unprepared

events at trial.

Yet, that is exactly the result that

petitioner urges here.

7

Indeed, the plaintiff in Imbler made very

8

similar claims with respect to the prosecutor's

preparation of his case in that particular instance.

This

10

Court, nevertheless, held that the prosecutor was immune

11

in Imbler.
The court of appeals was also correct in

12

13

concluding that the former prosecutor Fitzsimmons is not

14

subject to suit for his out-of-court public statements

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

I was just going to say I take it

8

your position is that if the defendant had been working

for the prosecutor and the prosecutor fired him and then

10

gave a press conference, there might be section 1983

11

liability, but if that were not the case and the

12

prosecutor just libeled him and somebody else fired him,

13

you would not concede that it was 1983 liability.

14
15
16

MR. MINEAR:

That is correct.

The former case

is more like Forrester v. White, for instance.
Now, turning to what actually happened in this

17

case, Fitzsimmons' statements plainly provide no basis for

18

petitioner's Fourth Amendment claim because the grand jury

19

indicted petitioner prior to the press conference, and the

20

indictment itself provided probable cause for the arrest.

21

Second, Fitzsimmons' statements cannot support

22

petitioner's defamation claim because, as this Court has

23

repeatedly held, mere injury to reputation by itself does

24

not amount to a constitutional injury.

In the absence of such a

Does that mean that even if the -- if

As I understand your argument, on its

face the procedures are all fair so that the fact that

difference insofar as there's a procedural due process

Finally, I would turn to the claim that

Fitzsimmons' statements deprive petitioner of a liberty

interest based on the outcome of his criminal trial.

9

Petitioner was not convicted.

The jury failed to reach a

10

unanimous verdict, and the resulting mistrial did not

11

curtail petitioner's liberty interest in any

12

constitutional sense.

13

In any event, petitioner again cannot state a

challenge to the Illinois procedures, such as voir dire

16

and change of venue rules, that are available to prevent

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE F. TAYLOR, JR.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. TAYLOR:

When the question of two

4

prosecutors, or police doing the act rather than the

5

prosecutor,

6

manufacture of the evidence, the interrogation of the

7

witnesses, and the prejudicial publicity, we see the basic

8

fallacy of their argument because what they're doing here

9

and what the court of appeals is doing is - - has a premise

comes up in both of the contexts of both the

10

and a principle which extends prosecutorial immunity to

11

all those kinds of actions.

12

that's faulty here.

13
14

And that is the premise

Now, the court of appeals --he says that he - excuse me - - the Government says that they agree with the

15

court of appeals decision in part.

16

with it in part in terms of the injury analysis.

17

saying that they're conceding that it's only qualified

18

immunity for the press conference.

19

saying that it's absolute immunity with regard to the

20

other, the manufacture of evidence.

21

Well,

they can't agree
They're

Well, but they're

Well, both of those are premised on the idea

22

that the injury happened within the judicial process.

23

That's what Judge Easterbrook premised his analysis on.

24

So, if you -- you have to see absolute immunity for both

or absolute immunity for neither.

1

argument is completely inconsistent on that position.

2

And it also shows the basic mistake of that

3

court of appeals decision, that its overreaching nature of

4

looking at the injury rather than the act.

5

the basic mistake of that decision, and that's how it

6

distorts Imbler and allows one to ignore the holding there

7

which the -- is that the act has to be intimately

8

associated with the judicial phase of the criminal

9

process.

And that is

And that is why we say that the Seventh Circuit

10

was in error and that, in fact, qualified immunity should

11

be afforded here rather than absolute immunity.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Taylor, I thought that the

13

concession of qualified immunity liability with respect to

14

the press conference was a concession of qualified

15

immunity as to injuries other than the injuries that are

16

produced through the trial, that is, qualified immunity

17

for any libel.

18

MR. TAYLOR:

That's not the way they stated it

19

in the brief.

They stated it in an absolute way both in

20

their summary of argument and in their argument itself

21

that it's not a question of absolute immunity, and I think

22

they say specifically that it's because it's not

23

intimately associated with the judicial phase of the

24

criminal process.

-- they may not -- they may have backed up from it a bit
