CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Ledger v. The United States.

Mr. Bork.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Newark Morning Ledger is here seeking a reversal

11
12

of the judgment of the Third Circuit which denied a

13

depreciation deduction on the Ledger's tax returns.

14

Now, the Ledger paid $68 million for the

15

subscriber relationships of those eight papers when it

16

acquired them, and there were - - these were enormously

17

valuable, 460,000 subscribers, because of the subscription

18

income they produced.

19

Now, these assets, the subscriber relationships,

20

are wasting assets because they have limited lives, and

21

for that reason Ledger seeks to depreciate them.

22

no question here that Ledger proved the lives of these

23

particular subscriber relationships and proved their

24

value.

25

QUESTION:

There is

without any promotion or subscription drives?

6

MR. BORK:

I don't think that's
Would the case be any

Would your

I don't -- it might not be just the

7

same, Your Honor, but in fact you're addressing the

8

Government's argument that these are self - regenerating

9

assets, that they just continue, we'll have -- no matter

10

what we do, we'll always have 460,000 subscribers.

The

11

district court found as fact that these are not self­

12

regenerating assets, and that factual finding was not

13

disturbed by the Third Circuit, so I think it is -- that's

14

a question - -

15

QUESTION:

What about the hypothetical case?

16

MR. BORK:

If we did nothing and got no new

17

subscribers, is that the question?

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

19

MR. BORK:

No, we would have a wasting assets.

20

We would have what we - - the paper would be gone at the

21

end of the subscriber relationships.

22

QUESTION:

But -- I recognize the finding isn't

23

challenged.

24

our common knowledge tells us that many businesses will

25

have renewed patronage just because of their reputation

I just find it hard to grasp the case because

2

and the quality of their product.
MR. BORK:

Well, I suppose there would be some

3

renewed patronage in that way, but the fact is that all

4

newspapers, particularly in this era of declining

5

readership, but all newspapers, including Newark Morning

6

Ledger, spends a great deal of money and effort trying to

7

get new subscribers to replace the ones that disappear, so

8

they just don't automatically -- new subscribers just

9

don't automatically appear, and the district court so

10
11

found they do not.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bork, I didn't understand the

12

Government's argument to be that these regenerate

13

themselves.

14

really don't regenerate themselves.

15

Rather, I thought their argument was they

You have to make expenditures to retain your

16

subscribership, but the Government does not require those

17

expenditures to be capitalized because those expenditures

18

are not going towards maintenance of a capital asset, and

19

it's consistent with that not to allow you a depreciation

20

on that so-called asset.

21

MR. BORK:

Those expenditures would have to be

22

capitalized but for section 173 of the code, which makes a

23

special case for newspapers, and it's --

24
25

have similar arrangements they would have to be

MR. BORK:

You mean if they are getting new --

6

10-year life, you would amortize the cost over 10 years,

7

but you would also have maintenance on the machine to make

8

it last 10 years, and that would be expensed.

9

We have to - - you'd
Suppose it has a

However, if you put -- if you did things to the

10

machine to make it last 15 years instead of 10, the

11

additional time would have to be capitalized, but the

12

maintenance of the machine is not.

13

QUESTION:

14

may they not be?

15

some capitalization?

16

Under 173 some may be capitalized,

Aren't there regs under 173 that allow

MR. BORK:

I wasn't aware of that, Your Honor.

17

It seemed to me that - - I know that we take them as

18

expenses, the cost of maintaining and acquiring new -- old

19

subscribers and acquiring new subscribers.

20
21

QUESTION:

May I ask you a different -- no, go

Before we get off that, but what --

22

23

isn't it the case that the maintenance that is put into

25

about?

It's the kind of maintenance that is designed to

2

MR. BORK:

Oh, no.

3

QUESTION:

It is designed to make it last not

4

just 5 years, whatever the normal period would be, but as

5

long as the newspaper is in business.
MR. BORK:

6

We're talking about individual

7

subscriber relationships which have been valued here.

8

maintenance that is put in to maintain existing

9

subscribers is to maintain them for the limited life which

The

10

has been estimated, not to extend them beyond that.

The

11

cost of acquiring new subscribers is a separate asset all

12

together.

The subscriber is a separate asset.

13

For example, if you had -- one of the more

14

illogical contentions in this case by the Third Circuit

15

and by the Government is that we could depreciate the

16

subscriber relationships if they were in fixed-term

17

contracts.

18

Now, I hope this goes to the question we're

19

discussing.

20

fixed-term contracts with its subscribers.

21

Government will admit, could be capitalized and

22

depreciated.

1

contracts that it purchased, when they're all gone, let's

2

assume that Newark Morning Ledger would still have 460,000

3

fixed-term contracts with subscribers.

4

Those are a different asset all together, so

5

there's no question of a double deduction or anything of

6

that sort.

7

subscriber relationships as they tried to get new

8

subscriber relationships, those were expensed under 173 --

9

different assets all together.

10

They purchased and capitalized the existing

QUESTION:

Is it true that -- leaving aside the

11

question of fixed-term contracts that you've just been

12

addressing, is it true that in principle, if it is

13

possible to predict an average definite life for your

14

subscriber base which is in issue here, that in principle

15

the same thing could be done with respect to your basis in

16

newsstand sales, and the same thing could be done with

17

respect to the value of your advertising base?

18

MR. BORK:

The same thing -- we found it

19

impossible to do it with respect to either newsstand sales

20

or advertising, which is much less -- fluctuates much

21

more, and is much less certain, and the issue here --

22

QUESTION:

Is it because there was just not a

23

fact base upon which the expert could testify, or because

24

there was something in principle that made it impossible

25

to develop that fact base?

1

For example, couldn't people have gone out and

2

surveyed the people buying papers at the newsstand and

3

found, based on their answers, that, you know, most of

4

them buy the paper 5 days a week and have done so for the

5

last 20 years, or whatever the case may be, and if you got

6

a sufficient factual base, couldn't the same kind of

7

prediction be made?

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes -- allow me to correct something

I just said before I answer your question, Mr. Justice

10

Souter, and that is I think we could have done it on the

11

advertising.

It would be must less certain.

On the newsstand sales, that -- maybe if you did

12

3

an intensive study and it turned out that newsstand

4

purchasers were the same people, maybe you could do such a

5

thing.

However, there's nothing wrong with that.

6

In fact, that's a healthy development, because

7

then you would know that they had limited lives and that

8

you would have a wasting asset, and you would depreciate

9

it, which fits the basic premise of the tax code of

20

matching your expenses with your revenue to come up with

21

net income, so if it were possible to do these additional

22

things, that would be good from the point of view of the

23

tax code.

QUESTION:

It might well be wholly consistent

with the code, but the effect of it when you were all done

1

would be that there would be little or nothing left of

2

what we speak of as goodwill, and that may be okay.

3

MR. BORK:

That would vary from case to case.

4

These are -- you know, these are fact-bound cases, and

5

there would be cases in which there would be a great deal

6

of goodwill and cases, I suppose -- there are cases in

7

which there is no goodwill.

8

9
10
11

QUESTION:

But the more intensively you study

each situation, the less total goodwill you would end up
with under your theory.
MR. BORK:

If, by new statistical techniques,

12

Chief Justice, and computers and so forth and the things

13

that are developing, and new accounting techniques, it

14

became possible to give determinable lives to these other

15

assets, that's right, they would no longer be goodwill,

16

because, as the Government concedes, and has conceded in

17

its regulations and in its revenue rulings, the defining

18

characteristic of goodwill is that it does not have a

19

determinable life.

20

If you can take some body of relationships and

21

give them a determinable life, they are not goodwill, and

22

there's nothing wrong with that, because what that does is

23

give you a more perfect match between the cost of

24

producing the income -- the revenue, in order to get the

25

net income.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Bork, does something which does

2

not have a determinable life acquire a determinable life

3

simply by being aggregated with other items that do not

4

have a determinable life and subjected to statistical

5

probability?

6

I mean, the fixed contracts you gave as a

7

hypothetical before,

8

subscribers, each one of them would have individually a

9

determinable life -- 5 years, 2 years,

if you had fixed contracts with

1 year.

Each of these subscriptions that we're arguing

10

11

about today do not have any determinable - - if you had to

12

make a judgment as to one individual subscriber, what the

13

determinable life was, you'd have to say, gee,

14

know.

MR. BORK:

that.

We did individual subscribers, and let me describe

This is a process the Government uses in its

cases,

too, so it's not a -- there's nothing unique about

We took samples from the 460,000 subscribers, a

22

statistically significant sample -- and there was no

23

objection by the Government to that technique, and they

24

couldn't because they use it themselves in other cases --

took samples and then determined what percentage of

In the sample.

8

MR. BORK:

Well, that's right, but the sample is

statistically accurate.
QUESTION:

But for the rest, you're making a

11

statistical generalization.

12

really point to an individual subscriber and say, the life

13

of this subscriber is, except for the few that you did in

14

the sample.

MR. BORK:

You don't -- you couldn't

Well, that's true, Justice Scalia,

16

but the fact is, that's the way these cases are tried.

17

That's the way the Government does these things, too, and

if the sample is inadequate so that it doesn't accurately

19

reflect the whole, then that could be objected to.

QUESTION:

The sample was fine.

Mr. Bork, I had thought maybe your

22

theory could be applied just to the situation where the

23

subscriber has to take an affirmative act to stop the

24

subscription, the kinds of lists where there's an inertia

you think, in making it possible to make a statistical

analysis here --

3
4

MR. BORK:

I think it is important, Justice

O'Connor --

5

QUESTION:

That inertia factor?

6

MR. BORK:

I think it is important.

That's the

7

reason that distinguishes these subscriber relationships

8

from the people buying at newsstands.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Is that why it's a little closer to a

fixed contract?
MR. BORK:

That is why it is the same as a fixed

12

contract under the regulation.

13

really relying upon the plain language of the statute and

14

the plain language of the regulation.

15

QUESTION:

I should say that we are

Do you think the regulation, that

16

last sentence saying you can't depreciate goodwill, is

17

consistent with the statute?

18

MR. BORK:

Oh, yes.

The statute doesn't even

19

mention goodwill.

From our point of view, it's certainly

20

consistent enough, because we don't want to depreciate

21

goodwill, but it's quite clear from the face of the

22

regulation -- I should say this with apologies.

23

misprinted the regulation in our brief.

24

the relevant language was misprinted, and -- there we are.

But the regulation says that an intangible asset is

2

depreciable when it is known from experience or other

3

factors that its life is limited and the length of that

4

life can be estimated with reasonable accuracy.

5
6

Now, that makes an at-will contract the same as
a fixed-term contract.

7

QUESTION:

But why is it that you can define the

8

asset in the way you choose, just because a portion of the

9

asset has a useful life, i.e., the current subscribers?

10

MR. BORK:

I'm not --

11

QUESTION:

It seems to me that when you purchase

12

a business, one of the things you purchase is goodwill in

13

the sense of -- the classic sense of renewed patronage --

14

MR. BORK:

Well --

15

QUESTION:

And simply because a statistician can

16

take out of the continuous patronage pool the existing

17

subscribers, I don't know why that makes it a separate

18

asset.

19

MR. BORK:

Well, it is quite obviously --we

20

paid $68 million for this asset, so that I would say that

21

that's a separate asset, but --

22

QUESTION:

Well, I have trouble with that,

23

because it seems to me that if you knew the newspaper was

24

going to last for only 20 years you might have paid less

25

than $67 million.

1

MR. BORK:

Oh, sure.

There is going concern

2

value, and there is goodwill, and there are other things,

3

but this is a defined asset, and we rely here, Justice

4

Kennedy, on the regulation and the Government's

5

explanation of this regulation.

6

You see, the fact is that this regulation we're

7

dealing with now first came into effect in a slightly

8

different form in 1919, not in 1927, as the Government

9

says, and it said that if an intangible asset is known

10

from experience to be of value for only a limited period,

11

the length of which can be estimated from experience with

12

reasonable certainty, such intangible asset may be the

13

subject of a depreciation allowance, and I think this

14

becomes important.

15

Then it said, there can be no such allowance in

16

respect of goodwill, trade names, trademarks, trade

17

brands, secret formulae, or processes.

18

those is an intangible with no limited life.

19

Now, every one of

Now, when Prohibition was upon us, the IRS

20

thought that the goodwill of a brewery or a distiller had

21

a limited life, because Prohibition was going to cut the

22

business off.

23

wasn't -- goodwill still couldn't be depreciated because

24

it didn't fit the statute in terms of being exhausted or

25

worn out, it was cut off by law.

The court later said that it still

But the IRS, when it allowed for the time being

1

2

the depreciation of goodwill, said that the principle of

3

depreciating assets whose - - depreciating intangibles

4

whose life is limited overrides the statement in the

5

regulation that goodwill is not depreciable.

6

limited life requiring depreciability was said to be

7

controlling.

The rule of

Now -- and in fact the current revenue

8

9

regulation -- ruling states that it was issued to remove

10

any implication that customer and subscription lists are

11

as a matter of law indistinguishable from goodwill.

12

further states that the depreciability of assets of this

13

nature is factual issue, so what we have here is a

14

continuing course of a code, a regulation beginning in

15

1990 and up to date, a revenue ruling which is now in

16

force, all of which contradict the Government's per se

17

approach in this case.

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question that keeps

troubling me, Mr. Bork?
You start out with 460,000 paid subscribers and

20
21

then in a period of years -- what is, 5 years?

22

period -- there will be a turnover, and you assume those

23

460,000 have been replaced by another 460,000, so the

24

original 460,000 is a wasted asset and the others are

25

brand-new.

But say you had exactly the same situation with

your newsstand circulation.

You had 460,000 people on

3

your paid circulation from newsstands, and you could

statistically find out that there's a turnover in 3 years

But my point is, if we were able to do that,

3

that would be good from the point of view of the tax code,

not bad, because it would match costs and revenue to

produce net income more accurately than we can now do it.

It would only match costs when you

those sales --

It wouldn't match it in an ongoing

MR. BORK:

That's right.

11

QUESTION:

As either the paid subscribers or the

12

newsstand sales are expensed, as you develop them.

13

only when you sell to a new buyer who will pay a premium

14

for it, and then your premium is really what you're going

15

to amortize.

16

MR. BORK:

It's

The seller when he sells will pay the

17

tax on the sale, and the purchaser, just as a printing

18

press, will take what he paid for it and use it as the

19

basis for amortizing.

QUESTION:

But I would suppose in future

purchase transactions they would always negotiate an

allocation for these various items and have some basis,

QUESTION:

Mr. Bork, do you think that the

Commissioner of Internal Revenue is entitled to some

deference here in saying we're not going to treat this

18

like an annuity, we're going to treat it like a nonwasting

1

asset?

20

MR. BORK:

I think not, Justice O'Connor, the

21

reason being that the commissioner's position has been all

22

over the lot in these cases, and his litigating position

23

is different from his position under the revenue ruling

24

and under the regulation, so I don't there's any -- the

commissioner is entitled to any deference here.

1

In fact, I think if deference is owed here, it

2

would be to the tax court, which has a great deal of

3

expertise in this field, and this Court, as I believe, has

4

from time to time recognized some deference to the tax

court, and the tax court uniformly rules our way.

6

QUESTION:

Well, you say the tax court is

7

entitled to deference in a way that the commissioner is

not in the case of an Internal Revenue matter?

9

MR. BORK:

Well, the commissioner -- no, no.

10

say the commissioner is not in this case, Chief Justice,

because the commissioner's position has changed, and

because his position runs contrary to the regulation and

the revenue ruling.

In the court -- in the district

that this was a factual issue, just the position we took.

It wasn't until they lost and went on appeal that they

switched to a statement that no, this is goodwill as a

inconsistent position in the district court with the one

QUESTION:

But it would be unusual in this case,

which came up not through the tax court but through the

district court, to say that some other decision of the tax

court is entitled to some special deference.
MR. BORK:

9

Well, I think it's entitled to some

deference, Your Honor, simply because they analyzed the

11

same problem, the same statute, the same regulation, and

12

arrived at the result that if you can give a wasting,

accuracy, then it is not goodwill.

really not sure of the answer at all, but you describe the

2

wasting asset as the relationship between the newspaper

and the existing subscribers, so that even though you have

MR. BORK:

Justice Stevens, if we bought a

QUESTION:

Is it your view -- and this came from

3

your reference to the tax court cases -- that neither the

4

Government nor the tax court has any definition of

5

goodwill, other than residual value?

6

MR. BORK:

There is no definition of goodwill

7

that's agreed upon by anybody.

8

does not mention goodwill in the wasting asset thing.

9

regulation does not define it.

The statute -- the code

I think if you read the regulation,

10

it's

11

clear -- the regulation breaks in two.

12

says, a wasting asset with a determinable life is

13

depreciable, and it gives examples.

14

The first part

Then it says, wasting assets with a life that

15

can't be determined is not depreciable, and it says

goodwill.

to the idea that continued patronage is the essence of

That produces chaos.

We have a bright line test which the Government
is trying to muddy to win this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bork, may I ask you how your

7

expert dealt with this distinction between the classic

8

case of the machine with the 10-year life and the

9

subscriber base that you're talking about?

10

In the machine with the 10-year life, we assume

11

it's got a 10-year life because we assume that people will

12

do simple ministerial things like oiling the machine and

13

feeding it with whatever it takes to keep it going.

14

In the case of a subscriber base for a paper,

15

however, the variables are a lot more subtle, because they

16

include, among other things, the kind of editorial

17

behavior of the paper.

18

I mean, if they make a guess about how racy the

19

ads may be and still keep subscribers, that's going to

cost money.

If they change from a Clinton position to a

about how long the asset will survive?

15

But I'm saying, as to a machine, a

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Petitioner's complaint is that the commissioner

disallowed it to take depreciation deductions for the

6

value of its customer base when both as a matter of fact

7

shown in this record and as a matter of assumed economic

8

behavior under the statute and the regulations, the

9

customer base has not been depreciating.

10

Petitioner's own statistical expert testified --

11

and this is reproduced on page 94 of the Joint Appendix --

12

that in the years under examination here the circulation

13

of the papers remained constant.

14

in the particular subscribers, but the circulation

15

remained constant.

20

petitioner in its brief says is the landmark decision in

21

the area although petitioner did not refer to the case in

23

be a value separate and distinct from goodwill that is

24

eroding predictably over a period of time.

Even when there's a contract for a

That is part of our position, and

And it is recognized --

But it seems to me it is not

consistent with the residual definition that you yourself

embraced in the case.

8

9

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we don't -- there's some

confusion between the residual method of allocating the

purchase price and after you've allocated the purchase

11

price to all the other assets that can be identified, the

premium left over is what is associated with goodwill and

with going-concern value, both of which are

So you say we have to define going-

That is the essence.

The

commissioner's regulations, the most recent regulations on

goodwill, which happened not to be in effect at the time

of this acquisition but which petitioner relied on in his

7

opening brief, we describe in some detail in footnote 23

on page 27 of our brief, and we show that under the

9

regulations it's the Class III assets which are the ones

10

that are residual after goodwill and going-concern value

11

are allocated, so they have to have a meaning other than

12

residual.

13

In the commissioner's own regulations, the terms

14

of the commissioner's regulations show that the residual

way of defining what goodwill is is inconsistent with the

In case A, the restaurant is in a residential

population, and the customers consist in large part of

young to middle-aged parents with their children, of young

adults and teenagers who come in on their own, and the

11

expectancy would be that, in another 10 or 15 years, many

12

of these teenagers would be coming in as parents with

13

their own children, many of the children presently coming

14

in with their parents would be coming in as teenagers or

Case B would be a similar prospering fast-food

more than 90 percent of the existing customers will turn

would be that 5 years from now he would have roughly the

QUESTION:

Most

Well, Mr. Wallace, it seems to me

8

that none of those examples involve the kind of thing we

9

have here, which is a contractual arrangement to have a

10

newspaper delivered at the door unless and until the

11

customer says I don't want it any more, or a relationship

12

that you might have as a depositor in a bank -- I want you

13

to keep my assets until I terminate it.

14

MR. WALLACE:

15

QUESTION:

Until I withdraw them.

Now, none of your examples have dealt

16

with that kind of situation, which seems to me to be able

17

to be analyzed for its expected life in a different way

18

than in the examples you pose.

19

MR. WALLACE:

Well, only -- only in a very

20

limited way.

I mean, any individual can withdraw his

21

funds from a bank account at any time.

22

briefs said that a premium is paid for a bank location

that has a large volume of core deposits, but is that

premium paid because the purchaser thinks that this is a

business that can be expected to be done at this

2

particular bank location?

3

I mean, of course it's less daunting for the

4

purchaser of a business to be faced only with the task of

5

maintaining an existing level of patronage than to try to

6

build up a level of patronage that is not already existing

7

in the business.

8

9

It's an expectancy of future patronage that is
symbolized, rather than a separate value.

Any of these

10

subscribers could, the day after the purchase, call up and

11

say I don't want the paper to be delivered any more, and

12

they would have no obligation except to pay for papers

13

that they've already received.

14

That's not terribly different from the people

who have an appointment at the beauty parlor for -- each
