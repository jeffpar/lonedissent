CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Ms. Young, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOLA JEAN YOUNG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. YOUNG:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Thomas Lee Deal, the petitioner, committed six

10
11

bank robberies in the Houston, Texas area during a 4-

12

month period.

13

sentenced for those bank robberies he was found guilty and

14

sentenced for six counts of using a firearm during a crime

15

of violence and for being a felon in possession of a

16

weapon.

17

given notice that he would receive 20-year sentences on

18

five of the six counts for using a firearm during a crime

19

of violence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 924(c).

20

In addition to being found guilty and

At issue in this case is whether Mr. Deal was

Mr. Deal contends that his Fifth Amendment due

21

process rights were violated because the rule of lenity

22

was not applied when imposing the 20-year sentences under

23

section 924(c).

24
25

QUESTION:

It's your position, Ms. Young, that

the rule of lenity is required by the Fifth Amendment?

MS. YOUNG:

1

No, Your Honor, it is required by

2

the rulings of this Court when a statute is ambiguous.

So

3

for that reason petitioner is asking this Court to

4

construe the statute as imposing a 20-year sentence only

5

if the offense is committed after a previous 5-year

6

sentence has been, has become final.

7

is necessary because the language of section 924(c),

8

specifically in the case of his second or subsequent

9

conviction, is ambiguous for several reasons when both the

10

language of the statute and the structure and operation of

11

the statute are considered.

Such a construction

Turning to the language of the statute, the

12

13

specific language at issue has two meanings, one of two

14

meanings.

15

occurring at the same time, or it can be construed as

16

multiple convictions occurring in chronological sequence.

17

Also --

It can be construed as multiple convictions

will be the ultimate outcome?

MS. YOUNG:

QUESTION:

Ms. Young, if you prevail here what
30 years instead of --

Of 105, yes, sir.
105.

So he is put away for 30 years

anyway?
MS. YOUNG:

Well, 30 years on the 924(c) counts,

24

plus he received approximately 14 years on the bank

25

robberies which was to run concurrently with 10 years for

MS. YOUNG:

Yes, sir, they were.

bank robberies, there were four different banks, and two

11

of the banks were robbed twice but at different dates, on

12

different dates.
QUESTION:

So if there had just been, if there

14

had just been separate indictments for the six bank

15

robberies, one indictment for each bank robbery, you

16

wouldn't be here, I suppose?
MS. YOUNG:

17

Yes, Your Honor, we would still be

18

here because looking at the operation of the statute, the

19

statute is in two parts.

20

a 5-year sentence when a firearm is used during a crime of

21

violence, is clearly an enhancement statute.

22

penalty is imposed for violation of another statutory

23

provision.

MS. YOUNG:

QUESTION:

4

Yes, sir.
And similarly for the other five.

Wouldn't the statute apply, the enhancement apply there?
MS. YOUNG:

5

No, Your Honor, because the second

6

part of the statute, in the case of his second or

7

subsequent conviction, is a recidivist statute, and that

8

language, in the case of, is linking the second part of

9

the statute to the first, and it's --

QUESTION:

Oh, after, you mean after he had

served the 5-year sentence?
MS. YOUNG:

Yes.

And that's because of the

language in the case of, because it's referring back to

that part in the first clause, that use of a firearm and

24

receiving a 5-year sentence.

going back to Justice White's hypo?

sentenced to the 5-years enhancement and if for some

3

reason he escaped from custody before being sent to prison

and committed another bank robbery, wouldn't he be subject

to the second enhancement for that even though he had not

Well -Even on your theory that it's a

at the general policy of recidivist statutes, and that is

3

QUESTION:

Well, I don't mean to cut you off

4

there, but I just thought on your own argument that in the

5

case that I give he would be subject to the second

6

enhancement.

7

Did I misunderstand you?

MS. YOUNG:

The position is that the offense

8

would have to have become final, the offense would have to

9

occur after.

And you are correct, because your

20

hypothetical said that if he had been sentenced, he was in

21

prison and he escaped.

22

for the bank robbery that occurred after the escape the 20

23

years would apply.

Then yes, you are correct, then

QUESTION:

Okay.

Ms. Young, do we know that -- how do

we know this is a recidivist statute?

2

habitual criminal statute.

3

only reason for imposing greater sentences for the later

4

crime is that this guy just doesn't learn from being in

jail.

jail or not, people who are habitual criminals are worse

than people who on one occasion robbed a bank.

robbed six banks, one after another.

the text, I assume.

13

of his second or subsequent conviction.

14

the most you can make out of that, the very most is that

15

the first conviction has to have been final before the

16

second, which means in Justice White's hypothetical you

17

would have to say so long as he has been sentenced on the

18

first count, when he is sentenced for the second count you

19

are dealing with in the case of a second conviction and he

20

should get the enhanced sentence.
MS. YOUNG:

21

We don't know, so we have to look to
And what the text says, in the case
It seems to me

Well, given that situation we don't

22

know which of the counts would be the second conviction.

23

There is no notice of where the second conviction occurs.

QUESTION:
you think?

Well, it means second in time, don't

What else could it mean?

1

subsequent.

Subsequent --

MS. YOUNG:

2

It could mean second in order or it

3

could mean subsequent, take the meaning of subsequent,

4

which would refer to later in time.

5

problem is that Mr. Deal, a person in Mr. Deal's position

6

would not have any notice of when that enhancement would

7

apply, the 20-year sentence would apply.
The respondent I think concedes the ambiguity of

8

9

But he had -- the

this language by rewriting the statute in a manner that

10

changes the language.

Respondent's construction of this

11

statute, which as I said is a rewrite, is that there would

12

be 20 years for any subsequent offense, and that does not

13

give effect to every clause and word of the statute.

14

If we look at the operation of the statute

15

because the language itself is ambiguous, I would also --

16

I need to back up a minute to the language of conviction.

17

That also goes to the ambiguity of the language because

18

conviction, as this Court has noted in previous opinions,

19

that the word conviction carries two different meanings

20

and Congress has attached different meanings to different

21

statutes.

22

conviction in the statute, so we would have to construe

23

conviction as meaning a final judgment and not simply a

24

finding of guilt, as the respondent would have us do.

25

And there is no definition of the word

1

the statute, although the language is unclear we can glean

2

some help from the structure in support of petitioner's

3

construction.

4

that is it imposes an increased punishment for one

5

convicted under another statutory provision.

6

part is a recidivist statute because of the words in the

7

case of, which clearly refer to a legal proceeding which

8

introduces a stiffer penalty for one who has ignored a

9

previous notice by way of a conviction.

10
11

The first part is the sentence enhancement,

QUESTION:

The second

The --

You say -- what meaning is it you

attach to the words in the case of?

12

MS. YOUNG:

13

QUESTION:

A legal proceeding.
Well why, don't we use the phrase in

14

the case of very often just to identify a particular

15

episode that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with

16

a legal proceeding?

17

MS. YOUNG:

Yes, we do, but as this Court has

18

noted, when a term has more than one meaning and there is

19

a meaning that is applicable in a legal sense, then the

20

legal sense is the one that governs, and that would be the

21

reason for construing in the case of as a legal

22

proceeding.

QUESTION:

And what case would you cite for the

proposition that you just stated?
MS. YOUNG:

That case comes, that comes from the

but there is a case and it is cited in our brief for that

proposition.

The dependence --

QUESTION:

it said after conviction in a second or subsequent case?

MS. YOUNG:

QUESTION:

9

So you would read the statute as if

I would -That's the way you would have us

interpret the statute?
MS. YOUNG:

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. YOUNG:

I would read it after conviction -In a second or subsequent case.
If an offense after conviction, an

12

offense that is sentenced in a proceeding after conviction

13

would receive a 20-year sentence.

14
15

QUESTION:

Well, actually you would say after

conviction and after the sentence has been served?

16

MS. YOUNG:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.
Yes.

But what you're applying that

18

after to is not the later case.

19

to say in the case of - - not in the case of his second or

20

subsequent conviction, but you're saying in a case

21

involving criminal activity, alleged criminal activity

22

that occurred after his first conviction.

23

MS. YOUNG:

QUESTION:

25

You're really reading it

That's correct, Justice Scalia.
You insist not just that the case be

second, but that the criminal, alleged criminal activity

upon which the case is based be second.

2

MS. YOUNG:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct.
That's -- I mean, I can follow you

4

the first step, that the case has to be second, although I

5

can't see why anyone would want such a disposition, why

6

you would insist on six separate trials instead of one

7

trial in order to get the enhancement.

8

Your disposition makes some sense, it turns this into a

9

recidivist statute, but I don't see how you can get it out

10

of the language.

or subsequent conviction.

All it says is in the case of his second

MS. YOUNG:

12

It makes no sense.

That's exactly the point, Justice

13

Scalia, that we don't get it from the language.

14

at the operation of the statute and we look also at the

15

fact that there are different sentences imposed, because

16

it makes no sense to impose 5 years and 20 years at the

17

same time.

18

apply, Congress could simply have said 20, or 10 or 20

19

years for any offense where a firearm is used during a

crime of violence.

21

doesn't make sense to have those different sentences

22

imposed at the same time.

We look

I'm about to enter a second judgment of conviction.

2

Therefore this is a case of a second judgment of

3

conviction and therefore the 20-year provision applies.

4

mean, you can certainly read the statute that way.

5

MS. YOUNG:

That is one possibility, but I

6

think, as this Court has recognized, that a mere

7

possibility, a mere construction is not sufficient to

8

provide a person with notice.

9

reading of it, but again the issue is whether there is

QUESTION:

Do you think the conviction word used

14

in this enhancement provision refers to a criminal

judgment?

Yes, sir, I do.

And that's for two

reasons.

QUESTION:

MS. YOUNG:

It's not return of the jury verdict?
Not, absolutely not.

For two

reasons.

One, the last part of the statute refers to

violation of this subsection.

finality, and just a simple finding of guilt does not

2

require, it does not give a defendant any, it does not

give the sentence -- excuse me.

4

does not provide an indicia of finality.

How about a finding of guilt plus a

There there would be an indicia of

10

of the jury's verdict, says with respect to the first

11

count, you know, I sentence you to 5 years, why isn't that

12

then final if you agree with the question that I just

13

asked you?

sentence on the second count, it is final since there has

15

been not only a finding of guilt but a sentence.

16

So that when the time comes to impose the

Then yes, you're correct, then it's

final because the sentence has been imposed.

18

stated earlier, the requirement to then turn around and

do, impose a 20-year sentence, there is no notice and

20

there is nothing in the language to support that.

21

QUESTION:

But, as I

Well, to what was your argument about

22

lack of finality addressed, Ms. Young, because I assume

23

from your answers that you have just given that you do not

24

think that a jury verdict of guilt plus a sentence

25

indicates lack of finality?

1

MS. YOUNG:

2

QUESTION:

3

It does not.
So wherein does the lack of finality

occur that you object to?

4

MS. YOUNG:

I don't recall which justice it was,

5

but asked me if a conviction would refer to a finding of

6

guilt, and that's when I responded that a conviction would

7

not refer to a simple finding of guilt.
QUESTION:

8

9

finding of guilt plus a sentence?

10

MS. YOUNG:

11

QUESTION:

12

But a conviction would refer to a

Yes.
And in this case, Ms. Young, how many

judgments were entered?

MS. YOUNG:

QUESTION:

One single judgment.
One judgment including, all the

15

sentences on all the counts were incorporated in a single

MS. YOUNG:

QUESTION:

19

Yes, sir.
So you say in this case there was one

conviction, as you define the term?

MS. YOUNG:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

But the trial court could have

changed all that on the basis of the same jury verdict had

QUESTION:

1

Well, should it then depend on

2

whether or not there was one judgment based on six

3

convictions or six different judgments based on six

4

findings of guilt?
MS. YOUNG:

5
6

I'm sorry, I did not follow your

question.

7

QUESTION:

Well, ought the outcome in this case,

8

whether your client is sentenced to 40 years, as you say

9

he should be, or 105, ought it to depend on whether the

10

trial court says I am going to enter six different

11

judgments here because there have been six different

12

findings of guilt by the jury, or if he says there have

13

been six different findings of guilt by the jury but I am

14

going to enter just one judgment?

15

MS. YOUNG:

No, because then that still does not

16

take care of the notice requirement that a defendant would

17

not know when he would be subject to that 20-year

18

sentence.

19

U.S.C. section 962(b) as an example of what Congress can

20

do to overcome this particular problem, and that is an

21

example of what Congress can do, but that statute was

22

enacted 2 years after 924(c), and 924(c) was the first

23

attempt that Congress made to resolve this issue.

24

Congress made a deliberate choice of words to say

25

subsequent conviction and not subsequent offense, as it

also the fact must be noted that this statute was passed

in great haste when compared to other recidivist statutes.

assume?

9

MS. YOUNG:

If it had read subsequent offense, I

10

don't think so, because that's the exact structure that

11

the Government is relying on in order to get this 105-

12

year sentence, because the Government says for any

13

subsequent offense then it's 20 years.

14

would not help my position.

May I ask you, following up on the

Chief Justice's question, what is your experience?

trial judges normally enter separate judgments on each of

covering the whole case?

You want to say it has to be subsequent to

That won't satisfy you.

You insist that

Isn't that your position?

MS. YOUNG:

11

The options are not conviction or

No, because as one of the other

12

justices pointed out, if the person had been incarcerated

13

and escaped and committed an offense, then the 20 years

would be applicable in that situation.
QUESTION:

16

You have to have at least begun to

serve your sentence, is that it?

17

MS. YOUNG:

That's correct, Your Honor, because

on notice for any subsequent offenses.

QUESTION:

But then the offense has not

The offense hasn't occurred yet.
Another aspect -Of course that is inconsistent with

your own interpretation of the second use of the term

10

conviction, where the statute directs that the sentence

11

not be suspended.

12

suspend a sentence until after the sentence has been

13

served.

It's a very odd result to say you can't

I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

14

MS. YOUNG:

15

QUESTION:

You could not suspend -Well, you were arguing that the

16

second use of the word conviction in the statute, which

17

says that the judge shall not place on probation, the

18

court shall not place on probation or suspend the sentence

19

of any person convicted, has bearing on the definition of

20

the word conviction in the statute.

21

construction to say that he cannot suspend the sentence

22

until after the sentence has been completed.

23

the use of the term conviction cannot comprehend the

24

serving of the sentence or that sentence just doesn't make

25

any sense.

It's a very strange

That's -- I did not say it would

saying that the imposition of the sentence in response to

Okay.
Another aspect of the structural

ambiguity lies in the fact that it was almost 20 years

before prosecutors leaped to this interpretation.

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Mr. Deal was found guilty of using a gun in six

21

different bank robberies on six different dates.

22

district court sentenced him to 20 years on each count on

23

which he was found guilty of using a gun, save for the

12

MR. ESTRADA:

The significant point is that they

made seven different findings of guilt under section

it's something other than just a dangerous person statute,

isn't it?

MR. ESTRADA:

That is not right, Justice Souter,

what Congress is doing in the statute is two things.

We think that the second or subsequent clause

that immediately follows is written in the same vein, and

3

simply seeks to identify a particularly dangerous class of

4

criminals, those who would use a gun to do a crime more

5

than once and who thereby place at risk the lives of other

6

people every time they do so.

7
8

What Congress in effect is saying to those
persons is if you are the type of person who would do a
crime with a gun more than once you are just too dangerous

10

to have around and you must be separated and incapacitated

11

from society.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Estrada, is Ms. Young correct

13

when she told us that from 1 68 to 1 87 the prosecutors

14

did not read the statute this way?

that the issue did not come up in a litigated case until

It was not until

You mean you didn't think a defendant

would appeal a 10-year enhancement but he would appeal a

That's what you're saying in effect?
Well, I think that he is more

6

likely to take issue with the plain meaning of the statute

7

if more turns on it than not.

8

9

I think that is right.

The next point I was going to make in reference
to what counsel said is that it is not the case that there

10

were other cases in which the Government stipulated to a

11

lower sentence by reason of any view it had of the second

12

or subsequent clause.

13

Tenth Circuit and one from the Ninth, both deal with a

14

different problem that is not raised in this case and

15

which is logically antecedent to the problem in this case,

16

which is what the unit of the offense is under section

17

924(c), specifically whether using multiple firearms to do

18

a single crime is a single or a multiple crime under

19

section 924(c).

20

Court in Busic and from what the courts of appeals have

21

a single crime under section 924(c).

The cases it cites, one from the

in this case because it is conceded here that he is guilty

2

of six different 924(c) crimes.

3

Now, the important point about 924(c), as I was

4

saying earlier, is that this is not a recidivist statute

5

but a dangerous person statute.
QUESTION:

6

I suppose, Mr. Estrada, that if a

7

person robs a single bank on a single day and takes both

8

money and Government securities as part of the hold up and

9

there are two counts, that the consecutive sentence rule

10

or the enhanced sentence rule would apply here?
MR. ESTRADA:

11

It is generally the case, Justice

12

Kennedy, that if a person is guilty of two crimes of

13

violence that he does as part of the same episode, it is

14

true that two 924(c) crimes could be charged.

15

understand the facts that you gave me as really raising

16

that, because I don't think that the separate taking of

17

the bonds as part of the same bank robbery would

18

necessarily be a separate crime of violence.

single criminal episode, is guilty of more than one crime

2

of violence or drug trafficking crime, it is in fact the

3

case under our reading of the statute that if he uses a

4

firearm with respect to each of those crimes and thereby

5

makes more grave each of them, that he would be subject to

6

two separate counts under section 924(c).

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. ESTRADA:

9

Even though it's really one episode.
That is right.

And in other

circumstances where Congress has thought that type of a

10

circumstance significant, for example in section 924(e),

11

it has expressly stated that the crimes must be, must

12

happen on occasions different from one another.

13

Congress knows fairly well to write, how to deal with that

14

The thought that in the case of, for

Deal's case unless he also adds words like involving or

similar words, as he does in his reply brief I think at

page 7, whose purpose is essentially to nullify the choice

MR. ESTRADA:

1

Again, I think it is possible to

2

read the word subsequent in isolation to have more than

3

one meaning.

4

O'Connor, is that each of the words second or subsequent

5

take meaning from the other and make the context clear.

6

For example, it is a possible meaning of the word second

7

that it is the sixtieth part of a minute.

8

said that that might be the meaning in this case for the

9

obvious reason that everyone understands that in this

10

No one has ever

context that can't be the meaning.
Again, we think that as used in the statute the

11
12

expression second or subsequent really means another

13

finding of guilt at any time after the first.

14

Finally, as to the word conviction --

15

QUESTION:

Excuse me, after the first in time?

16

It must be after the first in time, and not just in

17

addition to the first?

18

MR. ESTRADA:

addition to the first.

20

time.

21

second to mean what its plain language says, something

22

that follows the first either in time or in number

23

sequence, or simply the number 2 in a countable series, it

24

is the case that it can be in time or in order and the

25

statute clearly encompasses both.

No, I think it can mean in
In order or in time, or at any

As I was about to turn to the following --

2

excuse me, to the final word that is of consequence here,

3

Justice O'Connor, which is the word conviction, again we

4

readily concede that there may be other contexts in which

5

the word taken in isolation might mean a judgment of

6

conviction.

7

that its ordinary rather than its technical meaning is

intended.

9

chronological order in which events are to occur.

In this case it is clear from the context

The statute by its plain terms sets forth a

clear that the, excuse me, that the conviction must come

MR. ESTRADA:

1

I cannot agree with that, Justice

2

Stevens, for the reason that we have taken the view that

3

if one were to read the word conviction to mean a judgment

4

the statute would make no sense.

5

anything more than is in your question right now we would

6

not know what follows from that decision.

7

QUESTION:

And if we were not told

Well, you would know there have to be

8

at least two judgments, because it has talked about a

9

second or subsequent conviction or judgment.

I suppose

10

one judgment could not satisfy the requirement of needing

11

a second or subsequent judgment.

12

MR. ESTRADA:

On that theory, and if that were

13

all the Court said, Justice Stevens, the judgment would be

14

vacated and sent back to the district court where we would

15

move to sever the sentences.
QUESTION:

You'd have to do that in every case

where the district judge made a mistake of entering just

one judgment.

MR. ESTRADA:

1

2

Well, that is what does normally

happen at the end of what happens in the district court.

3

QUESTION:

One piece of paper entitled judgment,

4

I suppose, could, you could say that that really is

5

several judgments because he has entered judgment on

6

several counts.

7

MR. ESTRADA:

That is right, Justice White, and

8

I think the, how that is treated tends to vary from

9

district to district.

Ms. Young indicated that in her

10

district this is thought of as a single judgment.

11

formerly worked in a different Federal district in New

12

York City where the document was called a judgment and

13

commitment order, and it was thought there to incorporate

14

several judgments as to each of the counts.

15

this is a matter that is thought of differently in every

16

district.

17

QUESTION:

I

So I think

Because on your, if I recall, your

18

argument is that judgment can never mean final judgment

19

here because that doesn't occur until after the sentencing

20

and therefore you would have the anomaly of having an

21

addition to the sentence after the sentencing was complete

22

and judgment had been entered.

23

MR. ESTRADA:

Right.

That the statute as

24

written, and especially in light of the tense Congress

25

chose, would make no sense because whereas the statute

sets forth a clear order in which events are to occur and

2

that therefore dictates that the conviction must come

3

before the sentence, you would be reading the word

4

conviction to include the sentence, which in this context

5

we think would make no sense.

6

QUESTION:

Certainly the Federal Rules of

Criminal Procedure contemplate that the judgment will

occur after the sentence.

No finding of guilt and no

amount to a conviction?

What you had there, was it not, Ms.

But there was not any finding of

guilt in the case.
MS. YOUNG:

13

Well, that's true.

There was not

14

any finding of guilt because it was a deferred

15

adjudication type case.
QUESTION:

16

The statute is ambiguous --

Well, I guess Dickerson does point in

the direction that supports Mr. Estrada more than it

18

supports your view that there has to be a sentence

MS. YOUNG:

It does not require that sentence

Yes, Your Honor.

The change, Mr.

Estrada referred to changes in the statute, and there have

been several amendments to the statute since 1968, but I

would point out to the Court that none of those amendments

have dealt with this particular language and there has
