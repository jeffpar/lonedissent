ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

GEN. STARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case brings before the Court a single

11

question, whether allowing alternate jurors to be present

12

during jury deliberations in violation of the Federal

3

Rules of Criminal Procedure constitutes automatic

4

reversible error under the plain error rule.

5

The background of the case and the pertinent

6

events at trial we think are important and can be very

briefly described.

8

financial fraud scheme culminating in a 3-month trial in

9

the Western District of Washington before now Chief Judge

The case arises out of an elaborate

20

Barbara Rothstein.

21

the district judge suggested to the prosecutor and the

22

defense council that two alternate jurors, who were to be

23

designed as such at the close of trial, be allowed to

24

remain with the jury.

25

QUESTION:

Toward the conclusion of this trial

Isn't that rather an unusual thing

GEN. STARR:

I don't think so, Justice Blackmun,

although we concede, Justice Blackmun, that this was a

violation of the Federal rules.

5

suggest that it's not that unusual, at least where it's

consented to, is based upon my understanding that the

7

practice does in fact prevail in certain courts in the

8

United States.

9

court systems, it is not at all unusual.

And the reason that I

It certainly is fairly common in the state

And in this particular case what Judge Rothstein

10
11

seemed to be pointing to was the fact that this was an

12

extraordinarily long trial, this had been a very dutiful

13

jury, it had been very attentive, permitted to take notes,

14

and it was obvious to all concerned that this jury was a

15

jury that had focus, not falling asleep at the switch, and

16

the like.

And so - QUESTION:

because they always excused the alternates in my limited

experience.

GEN. STARR:

3

Yes, Justice Stevens, it is my

4

understanding that judges, for example in the Northern

5

District of Illinois have engaged in this practice and do

6

engage in the practice, and that judges in the Northern

7

District of California engage in the practice.

Rothstein in her comments said many judges do this where

there is consent, and I think that is the key.

GEN. STARR:

It should be stopped, and I think

19

the way to do that, Justice Stevens, is through the

20

vehicle, I think the didactic quality of an opinion

issuing from this Court will be helpful.

13

nothing is at stake but this particular trial, is that

right?

15

GEN. STARR:

And therefore

Oh, I fully disagree with that

16

because if this is plain error, if this is noted as plain

17

error then this Court will have affected a transformation

18

of plain error law.

19

May I turn to that?

What this Court said is that rule 52(b) simply

20

codified existing law.

21

was which was being qualified we were talking about the

22

Wiborg case, the earliest case noted by the advisory

23

committee in an opinion of this Court where there was

24

none, zero evidence of guilt on the part of persons who

25

had been convicted along with the ship captain.

The ship

1

captain was appropriately convicted of this crime, but

2

several crew persons were also convicted, and this Court

3

said no evidence whatsoever.
That's why this Court in Frady and in Young has

4
5

spoken very clearly about egregious errors that would

6

result in a miscarriage of justice.

7

think it would be quite a new day and an unfortunate new

8

day if we decided that the plain error rule just means

the windfall of a reversal of a conviction that took 3
months.
And this was a very dutiful jury, noted by Judge
Rothstein in her dismissal.

In her expressing thanks to

this jury she said you have been remarkable for your
patience, your attentitiveness, and what I think the real
miscarriage of justice is here is throwing out the verdict

on these different formulations, and the idea of

get at, let us not engage just in name, in word games.

11

What this rule is about is whether something

11

think one of the dangers in the dialogue that I am

detecting is that there has been a suggestion that a per

In terms of a miscarriage of

General Starr, would we analyze this

Well, I believe that there was

consent, Justice Thomas, and it does seem to me that that

does in fact change quite considerably, because it is not

just unobjected to but the parties have gone beyond that

but we do think that this falls into the category, as we

2

argue at some length in our reply brief, into invited

3

error.

4

But particularly where the judge is saying this

is no big deal but I do want you to at least consider this

as an accommodation to the jurors, and then no one, of all

there were a lot of defense lawyers, no one stood up and

And Judge Rothstein obviously wasn't

focusing on 24(c).

She came out of the culture that many

11

judges do this.

12

And so it seems to me that where there is

consent here there certainly is no miscarriage of justice,

I'd like to begin by refocusing the attention

it is more appropriate to analyze each of the words in

You could read that a couple of

interesting, the Government in the first two submissions
to this Court read it the same way we read it, which was
as an objection.

All errors I think could have been forgiven.
It seems clear to me under the language of the

The question is did the error

With respect to the question of

whether the error here is substantial, it seems to me you

need go and look no further than to the advisory committee

particularly since Congress approved this rule against the

backdrop of an advisory committee note that regarded this

22

as a very significant matter and specifically rejected

this particular approach.

24

it has to be regarded as a substantial error.

2

in this context there are good reasons for why the court

reasons on the other side of the equation with respect to

MR. PHILLIPS:

it was reversible per se.

What I would say is that you

have to examine all the circumstances of the case in order

to determine whether there is reason to believe that it

the considerations in this case is that this is a jury

But the second point about it my assumption is

10

that the judge in this case was probably considering what

That is our understanding, and it

21

is my understanding and I so represent to the Court that

22

the two prosecutors were not privy to those conversations.

23

So I cannot represent what took place, but it is clearly

24

outside the record.

25

When they went back -- I'm sorry.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, General
