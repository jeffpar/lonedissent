ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. GORDON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. GORDON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The petitioners have asked this Court to review

12

and set aside a fundamentally flawed decision of the Court

13

of Appeals for the First Circuit.

14

this case misapplied the Federal Age Discrimination in

15

Employment Act first by upholding a jury finding of age

16

discrimination not on the basis of any demonstrated bias

17

or prejudice against Mr. Biggins relating to his age, but

18

instead on the theory that the Hazens discharged Mr.

19

Biggins from their employ in order to interfere with his

20

vesting in the company pension plan.

21

The First Circuit in

The court of appeals then compounded this error

22

by reinstating previously vacated liquidated or double

23

damages based on an improper application of the knew or

24

showed reckless disregard test for willfulness approved by

25

this Court in TWA v. Thurston.

The pertinent facts of this case can be recited

1

2

very briefly.

In 1977, the Hazens hired Mr. Biggins, then

3

age 52, to serve as the company's technical director.

4

Biggins held this position, as well as a seat on the

5

company's executive committee, for approximately 9-1/2

6

years, at which point a dispute arose between the parties

7

concerning Mr. Biggins' involvement in certain consulting

8

activities.

The

At that point, the Hazens discovered that

9
10

unbeknownst to them, Mr. Biggins had been marketing the

11

services of a company he had founded and named for himself

12

to competitors of Hazen Paper Company.

13

Hazens required Mr. Biggins to sign a confidentiality and

14

noncompetition agreement as a condition of continuing

15

employment at the company in order to protect Hazen Paper

16

from what the Hazens saw as a conflict of interest.

17
18

QUESTION:

21

Mr. Gordon, does the record show the

total number of employees at the Hazen Paper Company?

19
20

Accordingly, the

MR. GORDON:

I don't believe it does, Your

Honor.
Mr. Biggins, by his own trial testimony,

22

acknowledged that he had no problem with either the

23

substance of the tendered agreement, or, indeed, with the

24

Hazens' reasons for insisting that he sign such an

25

agreement, yet Mr. Biggins refused to sign the agreement

1

unless his annual compensation at the company were more

2

than doubled and increased to $100,000 a year.

3

The Hazens refused, the parties reached an

4

impasse, and Mr. Biggins employment was terminated.

5

That's all that happened in the case, and none of it had

6

anything to do with Mr. Biggins' age.

7

Yet by reason of the timing of the termination,

8

Mr. Biggins failed to reach the 10 years of service

9

required to vest in the company's pension plan, and it was

10

this fact -- Mr. Biggins' pension loss -- that the First

11

Circuit relied upon most explicitly as the central basis

12

for upholding age discrimination liability.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GORDON:

That wasn't all it relied on.
Its holding, Justice White, was

15

very clear:

16

the Hazens intended to defeat Mr. Biggins' pension

17

vesting, and that there was a relationship between

18

Mr. Biggins' pension status and his age that rendered such

19

pension interference age discrimination within the purview

20

of the ADEA.

21

22

23

that the evidence permitted an inference that

QUESTION:

How long did he have to go yet before

vesting of his pension rights?
MR. GORDON:

At trial, Justice Blackmun, Mr.

24

Biggins first testified that he thought it was a matter of

25

hours, without specifically saying how long he had to go.

On cross-examination, he was asked if it were

1

2

not true that vesting was 8 months away, and he

3

acknowledged that he had been told that.

4

no further on the point, and it stands in precisely that

5

conflict, that it could be as low as a matter of hours, or

6

as low as 8 months.

7

QUESTION:

The record goes

In his case, the payments would

8

commence almost coterminously -- or, concomitantly with

9

the vesting, would it not?
MR. GORDON:

Well, depending upon when he chose

to retire.

QUESTION:

But they could begin at once.

13

MR. GORDON:

14

Now, turning first to the issue of underlying

15

liability, the First Circuit's very explicit reliance on

16

pension interference as a basis for sustaining ADEA

17

liability was erroneous for each of three independently

18

sufficient reasons.

19

petitioner's position, first and foremost, that judicial

20

substitution of any factor that is not age for age under

21

the ADEA is inconsistent with the language and legislative

22

history of the statute and is simply wrong.

It may be

wrong to equate it as a matter of law, but it is not wrong

to consider it as conceivably -- or, strike conceivably.

To consider it as possibly relevant evidence.

agree to that?

MR. GORDON:

Do you

No, but let's just consider liability

It is difficult to see a situation

13

where it would be relevant evidence, except as evidence

1

MR. GORDON:

And in fact, the issue of when his

2

payments would commence is really not a relevant

3

consideration in terms of the calculus of liability here,

4

because under this pension plan, as in most pension plans,

5

once an employee is vested in their pension benefits, it

6

belongs to the employee.

7

the employer as to when payments do and do not begin, so

8

that issue really has nothing to do with whether or not

9

pension interference can relate to age discrimination.

10

QUESTION:

There's no economic benefit to

Well, I suppose you can use one --

11

must you not acknowledge that you can use some other

12

factors as surrogates for age, where the substitution is

obvious, such as you fire everybody who has gray hair, or

MR. GORDON:

Wouldn't that violate the

Yes, it would, Justice Scalia -Okay, and I -But not because they're surrogates,

19

but because the articulated reasons for your actions are

20

so facially unworthy of credence that one may draw an

21

appropriate inference that there is true age animus

underlying your decision, but the issue of proxies has

23

been addressed before.

This is the core principle embraced by Chief
Justice Rehnquist's dissent from the denial of certiorari

in Markham v. Geller, and the logic of Chief Justice

2

Rehnquist's position on this point we submit is

3

unassailable and, indeed, consistent with the long

4

tradition of this Court.

5

In determining the non -- the existence or

6

nonexistence of discriminatory intent under statutory and

7

constitutional provisions, this Court has a long history

8

of strictly respecting the textual limits of the protected

9

category at issue.

10

For example, in Personnel Administrator of

11

Massachusetts v. Feeney, the Court held that it was not

12

discrimination on the basis of sex to enact a statute

13

providing a job preference to veterans, notwithstanding

14

that at the time of such statutory enactment only males

15

were eligible for service in the Armed Forces.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Gordon, can I ask you a

17

hypothetical?

18

19

of seniority because it would be cheaper to hire young men

20

to replace them -- employees with less seniority to

replace them.

ADEA, that could be relevant, and it could in theory state

QUESTION:

seniority with the company?

MR. GORDON:

QUESTION:

What's your -- what authority do you

have for that?

15
16

That would not be a violation of

the ADEA.

13

It's cheaper

to hire young men than it is

12

That's my hypothesis.

MR. GORDON:

The statute simply prohibits

discrimination on the basis of age, and this is - -

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. GORDON:

I see.
This result is consistent with the

19

decision in Feeney.

It's likewise consistent with this

20

Court's pronouncement in General Electric v. Gilbert,

21

where the Court held that it was not discrimination on the

22

basis of sex for an employer to exclude pregnancy from its

23

benefits coverage, not withstanding the fact that

24

pregnancy is a condition uniquely correlated with being

25

female.

QUESTION:

1

2

Feeney is a constitutional case,

isn't it?

3

MR. GORDON:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.
Might not there be a different,

5

broader definition of discrimination under title VII than

6

there is under the Constitution?

7

MR. GORDON:

There could, and in fact under

8

title VII, because adverse impact liability has been

9

applied in that arena, there arguably is.

But the same

10

principles that we are submitting have also been

11

recognized by this Court under title VII as in Gilbert,

12

and in Espinoza v. Farrah Manufacturing Company, where

13

Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, found that it was

14

not discrimination on the basis of national origin to

15

refuse to hire non-United States citizens, notwithstanding

16

a logical correlation between the two.

17

It's thus our first point that judicial

18

substitution of any factor -- here it was pension

19

interference, but it would apply to other factors -- for

20

age is not allowed by the statute at all.

21

showing of adverse impact in the manner contemplated by

22

Griggs v. Duke Power, this would require reversal of the

23

First Circuit's decision here, which rested not on

24

legitimate inferences of age bias, but instead on pension

25

interference.

Barring a

Reason two:

even if this Court were, in certain

situations such as those suggested by Justice Stevens,
prepared to endorse the proposition that a trier of fact
applying the ADEA may substitute surrogates for age when
there is a factual relationship for the surrogate and age,
the case at bar would not satisfy the condition precedent
for such a substitution.
Here, the First Circuit simply presumed that
there was a factual relationship between Mr. Biggins age
and his pension status.

The court of appeals reasoned

that Mr. Biggins' age and pension status were, to borrow
the Court's phrase, inextricably intertwined, and that if
it were not for Mr. Biggins' age -- 62 -- he would not
have been within a hairbreadth of vesting in the Hazen
Paper pension.
As the Solicitor General has conceded, however,
and as the undisputed facts bear out, the First Circuit's
reasoning on this point is completely without force.
QUESTION:

Did you ask the trial court to

instruct the jury that the evidence of the pension was
irrelevant?
MR. GORDON:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, we did not.
Did you object to the admission of

the evidence?
MR. GORDON:

It would have been appropriate to

which made no mention of allowing the jury to infer age

animus on the basis of pension interference.

The evidence was

The trial judge gave appropriate ADEA instructions,

Now, it is true there was no objection made to
the introduction of the evidence as being nonprobative of
age discrimination, but that, of course, was true of every

13
14

piece of evidence -QUESTION:

Was there any request for an

instruction to the jury to that effect?
MR. GORDON:

There were no requests for

instructions on this point by either side, Justice White.

15

QUESTION:

16

your motion for judgment NOP.

17

MR. GORDON:

So your issue is entirely framed by

Yes, Your Honor.

Here again, the

18

First Circuit simply presumed a factual connection between

1

pension status and age that simply does not exist.

20

Employees at Hazen Paper vest strictly on the basis of

21

length of service.

22

Indeed, ironically, the only reason Mr. Biggins

23

himself was not long vested in the Hazen Paper pension at

24

the age of 62 was the unusual fact that he'd been hired by

25

the Hazens at the age of 52, obviously a fact tending to

QUESTION:

Is that clear from the record?

There's a lot of - - I had some -- the pension agreement

It was in the trial record -- the

summary plan description of the pension, not the pension

QUESTION:
MR. GORDON:

Oh,

I see.

Finally,

I thought -- thank you.
in addition to the fact

11

that age proxies are not allowable as surrogates under the

Well, may I just interrupt?

QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, why can't we compute whether it

18

was 6 hours --he was fired 6 hours before it vested, or

19

8 months before that?

20

MR. GORDON:

Because I believe the plan depends

21

on hours of service, and that's computed not simply

22

chronologically, but based on hours.

QUESTION:

No, Justice Scalia.

As our third point, even if age

9

proxies were allowable under the ADEA at all, which we

10

submit they are not, and even if in this case one were

prepared to endorse what the First Circuit has done and no

12

other court has ever done -- that is, allowed a factor

13

having no factual relationship to age whatsoever to serve

14

as such a surrogate for age, petitioners submit that under

15

no circumstances may pension interference properly provide

16

the predicate for an inference of age animus.

17

This Court held in Patterson v. McLean --

other grounds, but here, it is absolutely plain that there

is no basis for sustaining the judgment of the First

Circuit.

5

QUESTION:

Well, the Solicitor General doesn't

agree with that, and I suppose if you're right that

evidence should not have been used at all, perhaps we

should remand.

9

If you're right, we could say that the

10

extent and remand it to see what the other evidence might

11

amount to.
MR. GORDON:

12

Justice White, that is an option

13

that the Court has which was suggested by the Solicitor

14

General.

15

when the First Circuit opinion is taken on its own terms

16

and divested of its improper reliance on pension

17

interference as a basis for ADEA liability, the entire

18

inference of age animus evaporates.

19

We submit that it's unnecessary.

QUESTION:

We submit that

I'm not sure that's correct,

20

Mr. Gordon.

The court of appeals mentions in its opinion

21

that there were several adverse comments made by the

22

employer on -- is it Biggins age? -- and that the fellow

23

who replaced him, McDonald, was given a much more generous

24

confidentiality agreement than Biggins was offered..

25

certainly that tends to give some support to the

Now,

plaintiff's case, doesn't it?
MR. GORDON:

No, Your Honor, we'd respectfully

3

disagree, and if I could answer Chief Justice Rehnquist's

4

position by dealing with each of those separately, in

5

10 years' employment and in a 5-day trial reviewing this

6

extremely intricate relationship between Mr. Biggins and

7

the Hazens, the only evidence that in any way concerned

8

age were two isolated remarks that were, we submit,

9

completely innocuous in content.

10

In the context of the entire record, those

11

remarks, simply as a matter of law, cannot support the

12

inference that the Hazens were motivated to require

13

Mr. Biggins to sign a confidentiality agreement based on

14

age animus.

15

absolutely no basis for sustaining ADEA liability.

16

These are the classic stray remarks that have

kinds of utterances are mentioned at some indeterminate

point in a working relationship could sustain liability.

QUESTION:

Something like an old duffer like you

wouldn't need the handball court, or something like that.
MR. GORDON:

It was that Mr. Biggins and

4

Mr. Gezner wouldn't have as much use for the handball

5

court because they were so old, and the second comment, we

6

submit, was simply a true statement --

QUESTION:

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. GORDON:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GORDON:

Something like 50, eh?

The second remark -Oops -- right.
The second remark, Justice Scalia,

12

was simply a true statement of what, in fact, every

13

businessman in America knows to be fact - - that it does

14

cost more to insure older persons.

15

Indeed, the Congress which enacted the ADEA

16

recognized that very same fact, and that is why there is a

17

specific privilege embodied in section 4(f)(2) of the

18

statute allowing employers to make certain benefits

19

distinctions based on age, a recognition by Congress.

20

Congress is no more motivated by age animus in recognizing

21

that fact than the Hazens were here.

22

QUESTION:

Do you think it would be permissible

23

under the statute to fire all your people for whom the

24

insurance premiums were higher because they were older?

25

MR. GORDON:

Absolutely not.

QUESTION:

1

Well then, this remark goes right to

2

the heart of the statute, then.

3

MR. GORDON:

But there's no suggestions that the

4

Hazens discharged Mr. Biggins for anything to do with his

5

insurance coverage.

6

QUESTION:

Indeed, Mr. Gezner -Well, but the comment about, it's

7

more expensive to insure you, says, in effect, because of

8

your age, there are certain reasons why we wouldn't want

9

you in our employ, doesn't it?
MR. GORDON:

10

And if in fact that was the policy

11

of the company, Justice Stevens, that would perhaps state

12

an adverse impact violation, but here, adverse impact, as

13

all parties to the court concede, has no application to

14

the case.

15

As just a very brief final point with respect to

16

predicate liability, we would submit that under the rules

17

stated in Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, pension

18

interference may not ever, as a matter of law, provide the

19

predicate for an inference of age animus.

20

In Patterson, this Court held that when

21

construing a civil rights statute, it is inappropriate to

22

construe an earlier statute broadly and beyond the reach

23

of its text in order to cover conduct that is clearly and

24

in terms covered by a later enacted statute.

25

Recall that in Patterson, this Court refused to

2

of 1866, which simply barred discrimination in the making

3

or enforcement of contracts.

4

reach of that statute to cover on-the-job racial

5

harassment when Congress had later, and in clear terms,

6

covered such conduct under title VII of the Civil Rights

7

Act of '64.

8

9

It refused to extend the

The Court's holding rested both on prudential
principles of statutory construction, which we submit are

10

applicable here, and further on a desire to avoid

11

circumvention of the detailed enforcement mechanisms

12

provided for by Congress in the later statute.

13

Here, precisely as in Patterson, the existence

14

of a clear statutory remedy under ERISA section 510, a

15

later-enacted statute with its own independent enforcement

16

mechanism militates very strongly against stretching the

17

coverage of the ADEA beyond its text to provide a

18

duplicative legal remedy.

19

Turning next to the issue of liquidated damages,

20

I would begin by pointing out that under the law a

21

necessary precondition to an award of liquidated damages

22

is a legitimate and sustainable finding of underlying age

23

discrimination.

24

Should this Court conclude, as the petitioners

25

have urged, that there is no proper basis for sustaining

1

ADEA liability at all here, then the First Circuit's

2

reinstatement of liquidated damages must be struck

3

automatically, and this Court would not need to reach the

4

question of what the appropriate standard for awarding

5

such damages ought be.
However, even if predicate liability could on

6

7

some theory which has yet to be articulated by any party

8

be sustained, petitioners submit that under no rational

9

application of the statutory standard of willful can the

10

jury's finding of willfulness be upheld, and the district

11

court's decision to vacate liquidated damages should

12

accordingly be reinstated.
The ADEA provides in section 7(b) that

13
14

liquidated or double damages shall only be awarded in

15

cases of willful violations of the statute.

16

has stated numerous times and in numerous different

17

contexts that willful is a term of varying meanings and

18

must be construed according to its context.

This Court

Now, in Trans World Airlines v. Thurston, the

19
20

Court held that in the context of the ADEA, Congress used

21

the term willful in order to provide a form of punitive

22

damages.

violations of the statute, borrowing that standard from

2

for ADEA liability, with liquidated damages specifically

3

reserved for those most especially blameworthy and

4

reprehensible violations of the statute.

5

Petitioners -- in reaching this result, the

6

Court in Thurston specifically rejected interpretations of

7

the term, willful, that would, in the words of the Court,

8

result in an award of liquidated damages in all or

9

virtually all cases where underlying liability were found.
Petitioners most respectfully submit that the

time has come for this Court to modify the knew or showed

12

reckless disregard test for willfulness it approved in

Thurston.

14

was handed down has demonstrated that this test, when

applied by its terms, does the very thing which Congress

MR. GORDON:

It provides an automatic

3

enhancement in virtually every case.

There is a narrow

4

band of cases, and they are accurately identified by the

5

Solicitor General, in which liquidated damages liability

6

can be avoided, but they are limited explicitly to adverse

7

impact cases, which again research shows represent less

8

than 2 percent of the cases in ADEA litigation and cases

9

where legal affirmative defenses are involved, which this

10

Court has stated numerous times, such as in Criswell and

11

in last term's decision in Johnson Controls, are very,

12

very narrow.

13

As a practical matter --

QUESTION:

So that basically your answer to the

14

argument from the other side that there's still a two-

15

tier system is that the lower tier is so minuscule that it

16

could not have been within the contemplating of Congress

17

as sufficient.

18

MR. GORDON:

That is precisely our position,

19

Justice Souter, and indeed, the reason we know that

20

Congress could not have intended to award liquidated

21

damages in even virtually all cases where predicate

22

liability is established, is revealed in its departure

23

from the standards of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Had

It

1

would have authorized an award of liquidated damages as a

2

matter of course for every violation of the statute

3

subject only to a narrow exception where the employer can

4

demonstrate good faith as Congress provided for in the

5

Portal to Portal Act Amendments, but by doing the precise

6

opposite -- specifically borrowing the statutory standard

7

from the criminal penalties provision -- Congress created

8

the diametrically opposed presumption.

9

Numerous courts that have confronted this

10

question have recognized that when applied by its terms,

11

Thurston's new or showed reckless disregard test

12

essentially reads the term, willful, out of the statute.

13

These courts are properly recognizing that in a

14

statute such as the ADEA, where a specific intent is part

15

and parcel of the underlying violation itself, that a

16

standard of punitive damages activated merely by a

17

requirement that such violation have been nonnegligent, is

18

in reality no standard at all.

19

It is for this very reason that.a majority of

20

the circuits, as we've cited in our brief, are departing

21

from Thurston's definition of willfulness and imposing a

22

heightened standard for liquidated damages which properly

23

resembles the common-law test for punitive damages.

24

courts, by modifying Thurston in this way, giving life to

25

the common-law sense of punitive damages, are properly

These

ADEA liability with liquidated damages reserved only for

the most reprehensible violations of the statute.

Accordingly, we are asking the Court to use this

case as an occasion to refine the definition of

6

willfulness approved in Thurston and return liquidated

7

damages to their punitive moorings.

8

ADEA should only be deemed willful if the employer's age

discrimination is especially reprehensible, and in this

A violation of the

10

respect we have alerted the Court to a series of

11

considerations which at common law reflect how that

12

determination ought be made by a jury -- namely, whether

13

the employer showed reckless disregard for the matter of

14

whether its conduct violated the ADEA, whether the

15

employer's actions were repeated, were without colorable

16

justification, were otherwise unusually harsh, egregious,

17

or outrageous.

18

These are well-established standards for

19

common-law punitive damages, as this Court's decision in

20

Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Haslip reflects.

21

Justice Blackmun's majority opinion as well as Justice

22

O'Connor's concurrence reflect that these are standards

23

that the Court is comfortable with insofar as punitive

damages standards are concerned, and they should be the

When this standard is applied to the facts of

MR. GORDON:

I

Justice Scalia, we submit that

5

willful is a term of some elasticity, and this Court has

6

specifically stated -- has specifically stated on many

7

occasions in the past that it must be construed according

8

to its context.

9

In Murdock, the Court construed the term willful

10

to mean persistently, perversely, and utterly without

11

justifiable excuse.

12

that we are submitting should inform the definition of

13

willfulness here.

14

Those are many of the same factors

As a final point, the petitioners submit that

15

even if this court determines not to modify Thurston, even

16

an unmodified application of that test cannot sustain

17

liability here.

18

The First Circuit's decision to treat Thomas

19

Hazen's acknowledgement that he knew age discrimination

20

was illegal as conclusive proof of willfulness is

21

illogical on its face, flatly inconsistent with Justice

22

Stevens' reasoning in McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe, and in

fact restates the Jiffy June in the picture test that has

Justice Scalia, given the fact that

there's simply no avoidance of liquidated damages for

employers under Thurston, and it should be changed, but at

a minimum, even Thurston itself can't sustain liability

12

MR. CAHILLANE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

Circuit correctly adopted this Court's previously

determined definition of willfulness in Thurston and

16

properly considered the evidence concerning Mr. Biggins'

17

pension status, and I wish to first address why the

18

Thurston definition has been properly applied by the First

19

Circuit in this case, and then, secondly, why the pension

20

issue as presented does not actually appear in the facts

21

of this case, and that, even if it did, pension

22

interference would be proper evidence of age

23

discrimination.

definition of willfulness set down in TWA v. Thurston and

in McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe under the FSLA, the

3

definition that was adopted here by the First Circuit

4

which is currently adhered to by a majority of the

5

circuits in all cases, including those of disparate

treatment.

7

That definition as shown by Thurston is

8

consistent with the statute's plain meaning, it's

consistent with the legislative history, and it's

other defenses which may justify actions that may still be

don't even have to talk about a bona fide occupational

qualification.

16

on the basis of age, the other side says, there's no

liability.

Unless you actually intend to discriminate

Now, you don't accept that, but if you accepted

that proposition, then I think you would probably have to

accept that in the vast majority of cases, you can

establish willfulness.

MR. CAHILLANE:

that in the vast majority of cases of intentional

However, the two-tier structure means there's

how many plaintiffs there is, something that there is

simply no principle of statutory construction that would

It also leads to extremely subjective and

contradictory results.

In fact, the lower courts cannot

even agree as to whether or not to apply this to disparate

impact versus disparate treatment cases or whether it

applies to cases supposedly involving policies as opposed

to just individual age animus, and in fact that's a

12

distinction that is probably useless, since any policy

13

could just as easily apply to a single individual as well

as to a group of employees.

And the petitioner's standard adds additional

16

requirements, requiring repeated actions, or without

colorable justification, that no court, anywhere, has ever

suggested, and which certainly isn't suggested by the

language of the statute.

And one of the reasons why all of the lower

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Cahillane, you know,

reviewing this record from the standpoint of an appellate

court, which is obviously not the -- I would find it very,

15

very difficult to say that the conduct made out here is

16

outrageous.

17

extraordinarily weak, but that doesn't mean that the court

18

of appeals may not have been right in what it did, but I

19

don't think your strongest point certainly is that this

was outrageous conduct, because I think many people would

21

disagree with you.

22

I think the evidence of discrimination is

MR. CAHILLANE:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

that gets at the heart of the problem.

If the standard

very vague and subjective term, and that's a good reason

2

why it shouldn't be adopted by the Court.

3

I'd like to talk, as well, about the underlying

4

case and the pension question that has been suggested

5

here, and why we contend it is not really presented by the

6

facts of this case in the way that the petition for

7

certiorari presents it.
The case was tried under a McDonnell Douglas

8

scenario, and in fact analyzed by the First Circuit under

10

the principles of McDonnell Douglas, and Mr. Biggins made

11

out a prima facie case, there's no dispute about that.

conclusion that it had to be intentional discrimination on

age, therefore?

MR. CAHILLANE:

It may well be, Your Honor, but

22

it's not -- that question isn't presented by this case,

presented additional evidence of age motivation in that he

QUESTION:

1

Yes, but what normally is to be

2

inferred from the finding of pretext?

3

does that mean that it's intentionally

4

discrimination-based on age?
MR. CAHILLANE:

5

If it's pretextual,

Yes, Your Honor, I think that's

6

essentially what the Burdine case means, that -- well,

7

if -- assuming, of course, in the beginning, that the

8

plaintiff's case is a disparate treatment case and the

9

plaintiff is using a McDonnell Douglas scenario to make

10

out his case, that would be the result.
However, here, Mr. Biggins was singled out among

11
12

everyone who supposedly had confidential information, all

13

of whom were younger, and asked to sign a very restrictive

14

agreement.

15

Now, my colleague says that Mr. Biggins could

16

have signed this agreement except that he demanded a

17

doubling of his compensation, and I submit that that is

18

simply not the facts here.

What happened is that Mr. Biggins had already

been given and had already earned stock compensation to

the view of the owners of the company violated

confidentiality in the past.

4

MR. CAHILLANE:

True, Your Honor, in the view of

5

the owners of the company.

However, that was the asserted

6

reason of alleged disloyalty which the plaintiff proved to

7

be a false reason and, in fact, there was considerable

8

evidence to believe that that was never the belief of the

9

defendants in taking their action, that it was a

10

completely phony charge, because in fact, just before

11

Mr. Biggins was fired, he was told by Mr. Hazen that he

12

was a loyal employee.

13

they waited a considerable period of time to bring it to

14

anyone's attention.

15

QUESTION:

When this information came to them

And, since that's the case, the

16

reason they wanted to get -- since that was a pretext, it

17

therefore becomes clear immediately that the reason they

wanted to get rid of him was that he was too old.

that his pension was about to vest -- leave that aside --

but that he was too old.

QUESTION:

You say he was being treated

differently on the basis -- why on the basis of age?

He

QUESTION:

8

MR. CAHILLANE:

9

Whenever you fire somebody

No, Your Honor, and I think --

Enough to support a verdict.
No, Your Honor, it would not be.

However, we have to look at the entire set of facts here,

10

which not only is that he was replaced by a 35-year-old,

11

not only that he was singled out for disparate treatment,

12

unlike everyone else who was younger, not only that the

13

defendants were using his age as a weapon against him in

14

attempting to get him to sign that agreement because of

15

the position he was in because of his pension and the age

16

that he had, not only the fact that there were these

17

age-based remarks, which incidentally went directly to the

18

question of his benefits -- his insurance, and -- which is

19

very similar to the pension situation, in that it cost

20

them more because of his age.

21

So it's not a situation where we have just the

22

remarks or just the pretext, there are a whole slew of

23

age-related matters which directly bear on what happened

24

in this case which allowed the jury to properly draw the

inference that in fact this was age discrimination and in

fact it was intentional age discrimination.
The petitioners have attempted, I believe, to

3

contrive a purely legal issue out of that pension evidence

4

and attempted to emphasize what is essentially a factual

5

issue about Mr. Biggins' loyalty, because unless they can

6

escape the jury's factual determination that Mr. Biggins

7

was in fact a loyal employee, they are left with no other

8

explanation for what happened except age discrimination

and intentional age discrimination that the Hazens knew to

be illegal.
I would like to also note that, in addition to
this, there was evidence --

QUESTION:

14

that he was a loyal employee?

15

How do you know that the jury found

MR. CAHILLANE:

Well, Your Honor, that was the

16

reason advanced as a justification for Mr. Biggins'

17

termination which, if it had been believed, the jury could

18

not have otherwise concluded that Mr. Biggins was a victim

19

of illegal age discrimination, because they then would

20

have had legitimate cause for letting him go that was not

21

related to age, and in fact that was the central factual

22

issue of the entire trial on which both sides presented

evidence and the jury drew its conclusions.

Mr. Biggins, and they did not believe the defendants.

They believed

attempted what amounts to a cover-up in that they filed

with the Division of Employment Security in Massachusetts

under oath a false reason for Mr. Biggins' termination,

5

and in fact said that he wasn't terminated at all and said

that he had voluntarily quit, and as many cases have

indicated, this is also additional evidence not only of

the falseness of the reason given for what they had done,

MR. CAHILLANE:

Mr. Cahillane, you may resume.
Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I have just a couple of brief points.

The

7

petitioner here effectively is trying to reverse here on

8

what is an evidentiary issue, where they never objected to

9

the evidence being entered at trial, and even if the

10

evidence was arguably relevant under ERISA, never saw a

11

limiting instruction from the judge --

12

QUESTION:

Could I ask, let's suppose that the

13

only evidence the court of appeals relied on was the

14

pension item, would you say that we should still affirm?

15

MR. CAHILLANE:

Yes, Your Honor, in this sense,

16

because the pension --we agree with the contention that

17

the pension -- just vesting in and of itself wouldn't be

18

evidence of age discrimination.

19

But in the circumstances of this case, where the

20

plaintiff was 62 and was eligible -- was not only going to

21

vest, but was also eligible to draw on the pension and

22

take money out of the plan, only because of his age, and

23

he could only do that if and because he was 60 years old,

24

or over 60 years old, then in fact, yes, that would be

25

sufficient to show that the motivation was age, but of

course, as we contend, there are a number of other factors

that also add on to that.

to the question of whether or not it should be relevant

I don't understand.

You mean,

everything you let in without objection must be considered

to be evidence that is valid evidence against you, even if

it isn't?
MR. CAHILLANE:

6

No, Your Honor.

I'm raising it

7

strictly as a procedural point, that you can't appeal the

8

failure of the Court to deny the record.
QUESTION:

9

Certainly, you can't appeal giving

10

the jury an opportunity to consider it, I suppose, but if

11

that is the only evidence supporting the verdict, you can

12

still say there is no evidence supporting the verdict,

can't you?
QUESTION:

Those are two separate questions --

That may be, Your Honor, but in

MR. DUNNE:

It would appear from a fair reading

20

of their decision, yes, they singled that out in

21

particular, but once again, it would appear that there's

22

simply additional strong evidence of age discrimination.

Yes, indeed -The judgment of -Indeed, Justice White -Yes.
That is our position.
And I suppose if the only evidence

that there was was the pension item, there wouldn't have

MR. DUNNE:

We acknowledge that that could be a

basis for denying the underlying age --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DUNNE:

Yes.
Discrimination relief, yes, but the

17

important factor to be considered in this presentation is

18

the tier 2 inquiry, which does not talk about or properly

19

consider as a predominant factor the age discriminatory

20

conduct, but rather, was that conduct done in a manner,

21

with the knowledge that it violated the law?

22

That is what is the touchstone for

23

outrageousness, and we believe that the Court very clearly

24

in Thurston, reaffirmed in Richland, has made it quite

25

clear that that is the proper consideration here.

So for purposes of this case at least

the statutes -- if a statute said, there shall be

liquidated damage for a knowing violation, that would be

4

the same result as, there should be liquidated damage for

a willful violation.

MR. DUNNE:

7

QUESTION:

8

That is -For purposes of this case, at least

synonymous.
MR. DUNNE:

9

Knowing, or the reckless disregard

10

for knowledge, yes, that is our position, and that -- and

11

when, in making the factual inquiry with regard to whether

12

there was an entitlement to liquidated damages, the Court

13

should look to the question of what was the actor's

14

knowledge at the time he engaged in these discriminatory

15

acts.

16

I think that's very clear from a reading of both

17

Thurston and Richland, and the mischief, if you will, or

18

the confusion which has arisen among the various circuits

19

comes from having tried to translate the underlying

20

conduct to meet some standard in order to determine

21

knowledge of what the law was.

22

23

I think that's the very point that was made by
this Court in Thurston.

24

QUESTION:

But in Thurston, Mr. Dunne, wasn't

25

that a disparate impact case?

MR. DUNNE:

MR. DUNNE:

No,

it was disparate treatment.

Was it disparate treatment?
Absolutely.

There was -- it was

MR. DUNNE:

It was a policy --a group.

It was -- yes,

it was a policy,

policy because this was a large corporation employing

thousands of people.
Consider,

for example -- the argument is made,

10

well,

you ought to treat individual treatment cases

differently than a group,

only person who had been discriminated against by a

14

policy, whether it's a big corporation or otherwise.

such as the pilots.

There is no reason,

either in looking at the

statute or in the cases, which would suggest that Harold

QUESTION:

Do I take it correctly from your

4

brief, Mr. Dunne, that your response to the argument that

5

as a practical matter this will mean that in any disparate

6

treatment case there will always be the liquidated

7

damages, that your response to that basically is, yes, so

8

be it?

That's -MR. DUNNE:

9

No, the answer is not yes, so be it,

10

most respectfully, Justice Souter.

11

circuit court observed, it's in the nature of the beast

12

that there would be a greater incidence of the award of

13

liquidated damages in discriminatory treatment cases.

14

It is -- as the

However, when you consider that there are all

15

kinds of alternative means for getting out from the

16

awarding of liquidated damages --a good faith exception,

17

a mistake, an exemption under the statute, such as was

18

pointed out in both TWA, Thurston, and Richland, there's

19

ample evidence that there will continue to be preserved

MR. DUNNE:

Oh, well, take the Thurston case.

2

TWA knowingly issued a policy which discriminated on its

3

face, knowingly did, against 60-year-old pilots.

4

They went to their attorneys.

The attorneys

5

said, this is not good, change it.

6

obtained further counsel from their attorneys, and they

7

knew that they were discriminating, but they thought in

8

good faith that their action constituted an exemption from

9

the statute.

10

They changed it.

So there's a whole panoply of opportunities for

11

an employer to show that despite underlying age

12

discrimination conduct he should be exempt from the

13

liquidated damages.

14

They

I think that's an important factor, and I think

15

as this Court observed yesterday in the Roland v.

16

California case, despite the fact that there were a series

17

of circuit court decisions interpreting the statute in

18

different manners, the statute clearly did not provide

19

that in Thurston.

20

The Congress was very clear when it said,

21

willfulness is the standard, not the standard as set forth

22

as this Court did under 1983.

23

Thank you very much, Your Honor.
