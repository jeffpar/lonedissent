ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD M. BIRNBERG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. BIRNBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Carey v. Piphus this Court held that

11
12

procedural due process is so important to organized

13

society that it is actionable even without a showing of

14

actual'damages.

15

respondent had knowingly violated Joseph Farrar's

16

constitutional rights to procedural due process

17

essentially by obtaining a closing of this school for

18

incorrigible delinquent children without prior

19

administrative proceedings and hearings to which he was

20

entitled under state law and by the process of a state

21

court proceeding that didn't involve a fair and unbiased

22

judge.

23

In this case a jury found that the

In all events the Fifth Circuit in 1985

24

concluded on the basis of that jury verdict that the

25

petitioner was entitled at least to nominal damages, it

1

having been found by the jury that his rights to

2

procedural due process have been violated.

3

that notwithstanding the fact that that same jury had also

4

found that Dr. Farrar had been unable to prove that he had

5

sustained actual damages, but of course under Carey

6

against Piphus that was essentially irrelevant.

7

entitled to an award of nominal damages.

They found

He was

8

The question in this case is does that final

9

determination of entitlement to a judgment for nominal

10

damages, not more than $1.00, in a case involving the

11

deprivation of procedural due process entitle the

12

plaintiff who recovered that judgment to also recover

13

reasonable attorneys' fees under 42 United States Code

14

Section 1983.

15

answer to that question can be found in four separate

16

places.
QUESTION:

19

We submit that the question, that the

What was the denial of procedural due

process?
MR. BIRNBERG:

The denial of procedural due

20

process was very complex, Justice White.

It involved

21

essentially two things.

22

decision made to shut down the school and not utilize the

23

administrative procedures that Texas law provided.

24

secondly it involved interfering with the, there was a

25

district court hearing, a temporary restraining order, and

Number one, it involved having a

at that district court hearing there was, it was an ex

QUESTION:

was due process finally given?

5

But did the, was the proceeding --

MR. BIRNBERG:

Was due process finally given?

6

don't know that that question was ever presented to the

7

jury, nor is it in this record, Justice White.

8

of that fact is no.

9

this is the gravamen of your question -QUESTION:

10
11

But I would say this, and I think

Well, was the school, are we talking

about a school?

It has never opened.

It was

And in fact --

QUESTION:

And is it conceded that it didn't

deserve to be opened?
MR. BIRNBERG:

Well, conceded by whom?

It is

22

conceded that that's what the verdict of the jury

23

implicitly holds, that by finding that we had not proved

24

actual damages I think that that in fact establishes that

So you lose on the merits, you lose

MR. BIRNBERG:

I think that's a fair inference

Lose which by the merits, Justice

White?
QUESTION:

10

Well, you lost on the merits of

11

whether the school should be open.

12

MR. BIRNBERG:

We certainly lost on the merits

13

of whether the school should be opened or should be

14

closed.’

QUESTION:

The only problem was that they, that

it was by the wrong process?
MR. BIRNBERG:

I think in part that's true.

I

think the point was that there was never a process that

was provided.

the first time during the course of that proceeding.

2

But in all events, Justice White, that's not the

3

question that's presented here, whether the jury's verdict

was right or wrong.

whether or not having recovered a judgment that says

procedural due process was violated, and Carey against

Piphus says that is a judgment which is vindicated by

procedures being followed.
Then Lieutenant Governor Hobby, despite the fact

2

3

that he had no relationship to the closing of the school,

4

actually went to the hearing in Liberty County, which was

5

an ex parte hearing, the theory that was presented to the

6

jury being that that was to bring political pressure to

7

bear on the fact finder to make him not an impartial fact

8

finder in the procedural due process sense.

9

Now, Governor Hobby could have challenged, had

10

he chosen to do so, the fact finding that he violated the

11

petitioner's rights in the Fifth Circuit in 1985 or in the

12

district court earlier than that.

13

did not undertake to do so and this case involves that as

a given.

QUESTION:

Well, in any event we take the case

with the jury finding against the lieutenant governor?
MR. BIRNBERG:

I believe that's the posture of

the case at the present time, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Mr. Birnberg, do you take the

8

position that any nominal damages award entitles the

9

winner to get a fee award for attorneys' fees --

MR. BIRNBERG:

Justice O'Connor, I take the

position -QUESTION:

-- regardless of the context in which

it's given?
MR. BIRNBERG:

Yes, if it is a procedural due

15

process violation which is thereby vindicated according to

16

Carey against Piphus.

17

argument I have tried to conjure up what might be a

18

nominal damage situation that would not involve an

19

entitlement to attorneys' fees.

20

QUESTION:

In all candor in preparing for the

I guess this Court has at least

21

spoken in dicta to the effect that a de minimis victory

22

does not justify the award of fees.

23

MR. BIRNBERG:

That's absolutely correct.

In

24

your opinion for the Court in TSTA v. Garland there is

25

that sentence of dictum, and it's purely technical or de

1

minimis is the standard that you referred to.

2

that this case does, that a nominal damages award in a

3

Carey against Piphus case does not involve de minimis

4

victory nor technical victory for a number of reasons.

5

We believe

Let me direct first the question of de minimis.

6

The term de minimis refers to a type of injury which is so

7

trifling that the law can't take it into account, the law

8

can't do anything about it.

9

minimis non curat lex means, the law can't do anything

That's what the phrase de

10

about it because it is so trifling.

11

Piphus specifically says that the law can, will, and

12

indeed must do something about procedural due process

13

violations, namely give a judgment, albeit for $1.00.

14

That means that the law will, in fact this is the phrase

15

that comes out repeatedly both in Carey and of course in

16

Memphis Community Schools v. Stachura, vindicate the right

17

to procedural due process.

18

In fact Carey against

Procedural due process rights are intrinsically

19

non-pecuniar.

20

necessarily result in money damages occurring.

21

you cure those kinds of problems which are so, procedural

22

due process being so fundamentally important to the

23

society.

24
25

They are the type of things that don't

QUESTION:

So how do

Well, I would have thought that the

statute 1988 speaks both in terms of discretion whether to

1

award the fees and secondly that they should be in a

2

reasonable amount.

3

damages award shouldn't be taken into account in any event

4

under those provisions.

5

MR. BIRNBERG:

And I wonder if the very small nominal

Of course it should, and our

6

point is not that you should not take into account the

7

amount of the recovery in fixing what is a reasonable fee.

8

But as you said yourself, Your Honor, in TSTA v. Garland,

9

where it goes into the formula is in figuring the amount

10

that constitutes a reasonable fee, not in establishing

11

whether you have crossed the threshold to any fee at all.
QUESTION:

12

13

said you're not entitled to any fee at all.

14
15

Well, I guess the language in Garland

phrasing, but that's certainly is what it suggests.

MR. BIRNBERG:

20
21

Oh, you're talking about the

dictum?

22

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

23

MR. BIRNBERG:

Yes.

I think the dictum says that --

24

in fact that's, the dictum even, Your Honor, says that

25

there may be cases which are so technical or de minimis

1

that a district court would be justified, not that it

2

would be mandatory but that a district court would be

3

justified in concluding that the minimum threshold we

4

announce today has not been satisfied.

5

holding of the Court, the holding of the Court in TSTA v.

6

Garland is that you are entitled, you are regarded as a

7

prevailing party entitled to recover fees if you have

8

succeeded on any significant issue in the litigation that

9

produces some of the benefit sought in bringing suit.

10

But in fact the

Certainly that's what occurred here.

We

11

can't -- if we focus exclusively on the amount of the

12

damages which were recovered, $1.00, then we have ignored

13

Justice White's admonitions in Blanchard against Bergeron

14

that civil rights cases are not driven by trying to up the

15

amount of money damages that are recovered.

16

important in civil rights cases of course is the

17

constitutional right that's involved.

QUESTION:

What's

Mr. Birnberg, did you seek other

relief than monetary damages in this case?

So it wasn't as if you had obtained

an adjunction or, all you wanted was money damages and you

got nominal damages?

MR. BIRNBERG:

1

Well, Rule 54 of course says that

2

we're entitled to any relief that the evidence at trial

3

supports.

4

QUESTION:

Well, you wouldn't have gotten any

5

damages without a rule, without having a rule of law

6

announced that would permit, that would entitle you to.

7

And you got that.
MR. BIRNBERG:

8

9

That is

precisely -QUESTION:

10
11

Exactly, Your Honor.

You got in effect a declaratory

judgment at least.
MR. BIRNBERG:

12

That is precisely the point, Your

13

Honor.

That is what is so unique.

14

last night, it seems to me that a nominal damages award

15

really in many theoretical respects is closer to the

16

traditional equitable relief of injunction or declaration

17

than the traditional tort type relief.
QUESTION:

18

I was contemplating

Well, it certainly differs rather

19

sharply from an injunction in that nobody is ordered by

20

the court to do anything other than to pay nominal

21

damages.

22

MR. BIRNBERG:

It's certainly, that's certainly

23

correct, Your Honor, but what it does is it adjudicates

24

that there has been a constitutional deprivation.

25

that is the crucial point here.

And

QUESTION:

1

No, that can be valuable to your

2

client or to the plaintiff where the client is still in

3

the business, and so that deprivation will not occur again

4

in the future, or at least where it is not terribly fact

5

bound it might be useful to some other people.

6

don't see how this adjudication that on these peculiar

7

facts there had been a violation of due process benefits

8

anybody in the world, neither the plaintiff in the future

9

nor anybody else in the future.

But I

The only thing to come

10

out of this case is nominal damages.

11

out of it, and a statement that this person was wronged in

12

the past?

13

MR. BIRNBERG:

What other good came

But you see, that's an important

14

thing. ' A statement that this person was wronged was, and

1

MR. BIRNBERG:

We did not prove the monetary-

2

damages which he would have, that he sustained.

And

3

that's an important distinction.

4

and more importantly because the trial happens years later

once Dr. Farrar is in fact dead, there were witnesses who

testified at that trial who had never surfaced before

their statements in 1973 at a procedural due process

We don't -- and secondly

Therefore there was no possible
Had they made

10

opportunity then Dr. Farrar may very well have been able

11

to rebut it.

12

QUESTION:

Well, it may very well have been the

13

case, but that, I mean that's just the luck that goes,

14

good of bad, with trial dates, and that kind of

15

speculation can't be a basis for determining an

16

entitlement to counsel fees.

17

MR. BIRNBERG:

That is the reason that

18

procedural due process is so vital.

19

that we insist and the Constitution insists that

20

procedural due process take place.

21

that is established by the jury verdict that this

22

petitioner had his rights to procedural due process

23

violated, then the question is what, I guess what Justice

24

Scalia's question is is what benefit comes from that.

25

the benefit that comes from that is that originally Dale

That is the reason

And

Farrar, had he lived, Dale Farrar's estate can say that

2

the procedure by which my good name was taken from me was

3

fundamentally flawed, it was a flawed procedure.

4

Now, I'm not saying that that means had it not

5

been a flawed procedure the same result might not have

6

obtained, but it was a flawed procedure.

7

good name is taken by a flawed procedure the law says that

8

must be vindicated.

9

QUESTION:

Is your good name --

10

QUESTION:

Was that the basis for the jury

And when your

11

finding, that his good name was taken?

12

basis for the jury finding was that the school was

13

improperly closed.

14

MR. BIRNBERG:

I thought the

Justice Kennedy, it's very, I

15

can't give you a yes or no answer to that question because

16

the jury verdict was regrettably obtuse.

17

says that you find that Lieutenant Governor Hobby violated

18

the constitutional rights of Joseph Farrar.

19

various pleadings that the respondent has filed throughout

20

the course of these proceedings, the respondent has said

21

that what that jury verdict meant was that his procedural

22

due process rights were violated, and that's therefore

23

what I am essentially relying on.

24
25

QUESTION:

The jury verdict

Now, in the

is, what I would really like to do is to discuss with you

Your Honors why under the facts in this case applying that

standard and the four prong test in that standard the

plaintiffs here can by no means be regarded as prevailing

parties.

and then step two, having decided that even though it's

nominal damages he is a prevailing party, then go through

analyzing well, how much money should I give him?

Why not compress the two into one and say look,

whenever he gets damages, nominal or not, he is a

prevailing party.

decide how much money he ought to get that you come in and

I'm going to give him no attorneys' fees, or $1.00

And it's in the step two when you

attorneys' fees.
MR. COWAN:

Because, Your Honor, that is a per

12

se rule and we do not believe that a per se rule is called

13

for by the standards and the test which Your Honors set

14

forth fn TSTA v. Garland and Hewitt v. Helms.

15

practical matter to support your line of reasoning a

16

different trial judge differently motivated would have

17

said look, nobody can sensibly say this plaintiff

prevailed or if he did he prevailed at such a minor level

that no substantial attorneys' fees are called for, and we

wouldn't be here today.

QUESTION:

Now, as a

My point is if you're dealing with a

trial judge who's going to make that mistake when you

split it into a two-step process, he's going to make it

24

when you have it in a one-step process as well.

It really

MR. COWAN:

1

Well, Your Honor, that goes to what

2

I'm going to respectfully suggest to you as the third part

3

of my argument, and that is where Your Honors ought to go

4

with this case as far as establishing the law.

5

hope it's not presumptuous, I do have some respectful

6

suggestions to make to you in that regard.

7

Honors in TSTA v. Garland and Hewitt v. Helms went to

8

great lengths to establish very, very carefully a

9

standard, that's the way you describe it, and you set

While I

But Your

10

forth the various tests or prongs that one needs to go

11

through in order to determine whether that standard has

12

been met.

13

And we would respectfully say that when you look

14

at this case, not an isolated part of the case like one

15

jury finding, but when you look at the whole case one

16

comes to the conclusion that the plaintiff has not gotten

17

over any of the four hurdles, and he certainly has not

18

gotten over the last of those four hurdles, or the second

19

of the hurdles for that matter.
•»

20

The first hurdle is the one where the plaintiff

21

comes close to getting over the hurdle.

22

aspect of the hurdle is whether or not the plaintiff has

23

achieved success on a significant issue in the lawsuit.

24

And civil rights are so important, and Your Honors' regard

25

for those civil rights is so important that it can be

And the first

1

certainly argued that in this case the jury finding

2

creates success on the significant issue.

3

here, however, that if you look at the entire jury verdict

4

and if you look at the jury verdict in the light of the

5

pleadings and the facts, the plaintiff has not even

6

established success on a significant issue.

7

And that is true for this reason.

We would say

Hobby was one

8

of only multiple defendants.

Hobby was accused, along

9

with the others, of being a member of a conspiracy to

10

deprive Farrar of his civil rights.

The jury found that

11

all of the other defendants were conspirators, but that

12

Hobby was not.

13

conspiracy we wouldn't be here today because they would

14

have never reached the issue that was decided against

15

Hobby.

If Hobby had been found a member of the

16

The jury went on to find, however, that the

17

conspiracy did not cause these plaintiffs any damage.

18

response to a conditioned question they found that Hobby

19

had committed an action under state law which deprived the

20

plaintiff of his civil right, but that that was not the

21

cause of any damage to the plaintiff.

22

In

Now, in the light of the pleadings and the

23

evidence that Hobby did nothing alone, there was no

24

evidence that Hobby did anything by himself, the jury's

25

finding is senseless.

It just doesn't make any sense.

In

1

the light of the jury's finding that the plaintiffs had

2

proved no damage, it is clear in the light of the

3

evidence, which was largely undisputed, that these

4

defendants did not cause the plaintiffs any damage and

5

that the Farrar's own conduct was the cause of their

rather considerable pecuniary damage.

considerable pecuniary damage which was constantly

emphasized during the trial of the case.

And they had

So we contend first of all that if you look at

10

the case as a whole, not just a single jury verdict, that

11

the plaintiffs didn't get over the first hurdle of proving

12

significant success on the material issue in the case.

13

The second prong of the test is even more

14

clearly applicable to our test, and that is that the

15

plaintiff in the language of Garland received some of the

16

relief which he sought.

Birnberg clearly admits, the plaintiff sought only

considerable monetary compensable damages.

So it was, the jury then did not

award $1.00?
MR. COWAN:

No, sir.

The jury did not award

23

$1.00, and that's a critical point because the jury was

24

not even charged that they had the option of awarding

25

$1.00, and the plaintiff did not object to the jury charge

on that basis.
QUESTION:

2

3

They just found no compensatory or

punitive damages?

4

MR. COWAN:

Correct.

Now, punitive was

5

conditioned on an affirmative finding on compensatory, but

6

the jury found no compensatory damage, which in the light

7

of the evidence can only mean that the jury concluded that

8

the plaintiffs were the authors of their own misfortune.

9
10

QUESTION:

Do you think the case would really be

different if they found the $1.00 nominal damages?
MR. COWAN:

11

Well, at least, Judge, the plaintiff

12

would have the option of arguing that that was some of the

13

relief which I sought.

14

QUESTION:

Here --

Well, they did recover $1.00

15

according to the court of appeals, which is some of the

16

relief they sought under the same light, it seems to me.

17

MR. COWAN:

Your Honor, I would answer that

18

question no for this reason, and the reason relates to a

19

point that we discuss in great detail in our brief, and

20

that is the difference between nominal and compensatory

21

damages.

22

for years have said that nominal damages is not just a

23

little bit of compensatory damages.

I remember correctly you said in many if not most cases

2

where nothing is recovered except nominal damages fees

3

could properly be awarded, but not in this case because

this case is different.

MR. COWAN:

Right.
And the difference, I gather, is the

jury didn't do it until after the second, even the jury

8

didn't do it then but it took two appeals to get the

dollar recovery.
MR. COWAN:

10

No, Justice Stevens, the critical

11

difference is this.

In most cases where nominal damages

12

are awarded the evidence and the jury verdict will

establish some specific violation of right which the

plaintiff has remedied or he is in the process of

remedying.

But don't you think the effect of

this judgment will be to suggest to the defendant not to
do the same thing all over again?
MR. COWAN:

Well, Judge, all he did under the

12

undisputed evidence was talk to the press, send a letter

13

to Commissioner Vowell saying look into this situation and

14

consulf with the attorney general, and attend a hearing

15

which was conducted by people over whom he had no control.

We say that the judgment here sends exactly the opposite

message, and the wrong message, which is why you have so

many amicus briefs in this case.

MR. COWAN:

10

corrected in that regard.

determining how you ought to handle this case.

And the third of those standards is the one

17

which Justice O'Connor referred to in some of her

questions, and that is is the relief here so de minimis

that a fee award is not justified, and that was one of the

20

prongs of the test which Your Honors enunciated in TSTA v.

Garland.

MR. COWAN:

That's so minimum.

6

Well, here's, the court of appeals

7

says we have awarded nominal damages not to exceed $1.00

8

when an infringement of a fundamental right was shown.

9

And because the jury explicitly found that defendant Hobby

10

had violated Farrar's civil rights the jury should have

awarded Farrar nominal damages not to exceed $1.00.

it was there for the trial court not to do so when the

by an award of $270,000 in attorneys' fees in a case he

And the one, the decision that

Helms had a lot better case for attorneys' fees

Helms got a finding from the

entitled to a declaratory judgment or he probably would

v. Garland which used Hewitt v. Helms as an example of de

finding of a violation of civil rights when it doesn't

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD M. BIRNBERG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Thank you, Mr. Cowan.

MR. BIRNBERG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Let me address that very last point first as a

12

matter of fact and try to clarify, and I think Justice

13

Scalia was particularly interested in this.

14

jury question about the compensatory damages was this, do

15

you find from a preponderance of the evidence that such

16

act or acts were a proximate cause of any damages to

17

plaintiff Joseph Davis Farrar.

18

instructions, the court's instructions erroneously

19

described proximate cause as requiring foreseeability in

20

the sense that Governor Hobby had to foresee that what he

21

did would cause the type of results that they caused.

22

the explanation in this particular case for why the jury

23

found a lack of actual damages actually goes to, and this

24

was litigated in the courts below, the erroneous

25

definition of foreseeability.

The specific

Now, the jury's

So

that whole suggestion - -

QUESTION:

(Inaudible.)

3

MR. BIRNBERG:

That is correct, and that's the

4

reason the appellate court didn't address it.

5

does deprive that very jury instruction of its

6

significance.

7

QUESTION:

But that

Well, just as respondent is stuck

8

with the $ .00 award because it's in the question

9

presented, I don't see what you gain by arguing that there

10

was an improper jury instruction.

11

MR. BIRNBERG:

Then, Chief Justice, I shall not

2

anymore.

3

is I wanted to correct something my very, that Mr. Cowan,

4

very able counsel, but I think he may be confused about

5

the facts of Hewitt against Helms.

6

was the on all fours case.

7

against Helms, and it starts with Justice Scalia's comment

8

about the fact this is bizarre, here we have somebody who

9

is claiming to be a prevailing party who had never won

I shall move on instead to the next point which

anything and lost the judgment.
Hewitt against Helms is the case in which the

22

judgment goes against the plaintiff on qualified immunity

23

grounds and the plaintiff actually won nothing at any time

24

in Hewitt against Helms except an interlocutory

25

declaration by the appellate court that it was okay for

nonetheless he is not the prevailing party.

8

us it's the flip side of the situation that was presented

in Hewitt against Helms.

We've got a case here in which the plaintiff in

In fact we have got exactly the opposite

I had started, Justice O'Connor, addressing the

11

two phrases are de minimis and technical, and I think I

12

had addressed the de minimis issue in the context of de

13

minimis non curat lex.

14

-

Technical, there's a very interesting thing

15

about all of the cases that you describe in that opinion,

16

and all of them really, in which you suggest that these

17

might be examples of technical victories.

And every

18

technical victory has this common thread.

They are all

19

cases in which really there was no concrete justiciable

20

controversy.

21

controversies, such as there was the footnote that

22

referred to the old district court opinion where there was

a challenge to an ancient curfew law.

Yes, they

aspects to it, but so what, nobody was threatened under

2

that law.

3

All of those cases, I submit to the Court, where

4

there has been something that one could regard as a

5

technical violation, are cases in which in point of fact

6

they were non justiciable to begin with.

7

Garland has the example of the one part of the regulation

8

that none of the teachers had ever been denied permission

9

to meet pursuant to, never expected to ask that that

The TSTA v.

10

particular part of the regulation be implication, and

11

counsel at oral argument conceded that that part of the

12

case did not come across the threshold.

hypothetical, theoretical, not real violation.

It was a

15

we're dealing with here is, and I think this is the

16

threshold, is an actual deprivation, one that the jury has

found actually occurred.

18

19

that find that.

20

where the jury found that Hobby committed act or acts

21

under color of law that deprived the plaintiff of civil

22

rights guaranteed by the Constitution, but there is also,

23

and I think this is a significant one, the very, the

24

second jury question asked whether Hobby was entitled to

25

qualified immunity, and the jury found that he was not.

And in fact the jury

1

And when you superimpose that upon the instructions which

2

defined qualified immunity you will find that the

3

qualified immunity instructions required them to find that

4

he knowingly violated a constitutional right, knowing that

5

he had done wrong, and without any good faith or other

extenuating circumstances.

So - - I see the red light is on.

we would ask the Court that this judgment be reversed.
