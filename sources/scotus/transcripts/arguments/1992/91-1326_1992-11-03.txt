ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONNA M. MURASKY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. MURASKY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
When State Workers Compensation laws were

12

enacted beginning some 80 years ago, an active employee's

13

compensation consisted principally if not exclusively of

14

wages for hours worked.

15

Times have changed.

In recent years, an

16

increasingly important component of an employee's

17

compensation is comprised of benefits in lieu of higher

18

wages, including health insurance benefits for employees

19

and their families.

20

In 1974, Congress recognized the importance of

21

nonwage benefits when it enacted the Employee Retirement

22

Income Security Act.

23

level of regulation on virtually all employers who provide

24

nonwage benefits to employees, and it preempted State laws

25

relating to such regulated plans.

In ERISA, Congress imposed a modest

1

At the same time, however, Congress expressly

2

declined to regulate employers insofar as they had benefit

3

plans maintained solely to comply with State Workers

4

Compensation unemployment compensation and disability

5

insurance laws, and Congress allowed State regulation of

6

such plans to continue.

7

The issue in this case concerns the intersection

8

of ERISA's preemption and Workers Compensation provisions.

9

The case arises because the District of Columbia amended

10

its Workers Compensation law in 1990 to take into account

11

modern compensation practices by providing some level of

12

protection to employees and their families against a loss

13

of health insurance when employees are killed or injured

14

on the j ob.

15

The Equity Amendment Act requires all employers

16

who provide health insurance benefits to their active

17

workers to provide equivalent health insurance benefits

18

for up to 52 weeks when their employees are eligible to

19

receive Workers Compensation.

20

The court below ruled that although ERISA

21

permits the States to require health insurance as part of

22

Workers Compensation, ERISA does not permit the States to

23

regulate those benefits in the usual Workers Compensation

24

way by pegging them to benefits employees receive as

25

active workers.

The District of Columbia believes that this

1

2

decision is wrong.

3

replacement method it has adopted for determining health

4

insurance benefits in its Workers Compensation law no more

5

implicates the concerns of ERISA than with the

6

freestanding law that the court below correctly ruled

7

would clearly be permissible under this Court's decision

8

in Shaw v. Delta Air Lines.

9

It believes that the traditional loss

In Shaw, this Court unanimously ruled that a

10

State disability insurance benefits law was not preempted

11

by ERISA.

12

relates-to language of the ERISA preemption provision in

13

two ways:

14

ordinarily means a reference to or a benefit or a

15

connection with an employee benefit plan.

16

hand, the court said that there may be some State actions

17

that affect ERISA-covered plans in two remote peripheral

18

or tenuous a way to warrant a finding that the law relates

19

to the ERISA-covered plan.

In that ruling, the Court explained the

first, the Court said that relates-to

On the other

For the reasons that follow, we do not believe

20
21

that the Equity Amendment Act relates to ERISA-covered

22

plans.

23

Instead, its reference is employees and benefits.

24

applies to all employers in the District, including

25

employers who are not subject to ERISA at all.

The act does not refer to ERISA-covered plans.

It

It does

1

not regulate the content or administration of ERISA-

2

covered plans, and it does not require employers to alter

3

in any way their ERISA-covered plans.

4

QUESTION:

Is that because you can provide

5

health insurance coverage without having an ERISA plan?

6

You simply buy a policy, group policy for your employees,

7

and that's not ERISA-covered.
MS. MURASKY:

8

9
10

My understanding is that

Governments and churches are exempt from ERISA coverage.
All private employers are not exempt from ERISA.
QUESTION:

11

So if an employer, say, having 15

12

people simply wants to cover his employees with health

13

insurance and buys a group insurance policy, that's

14

covered by ERISA.

15
16
17

MS. MURASKY:

Yes.

If it is a private employer,

he must - QUESTION:

Well then, it does seem that the

18

statutory scheme here does impinge on ERISA-covered plans

19

in almost all cases in that the employer's liability must

20

be determined by the contents of the plan, and any time he

21

changes or she changes the plan in any way, the extent of

22

liability under the statute changes.

23

in effect incorporates an ERISA plan into your statute.

24
25

MS. MURASKY:

It seems to me that

I don't believe it does, I think

for essentially two reasons.

First, let us assume that instead of ERISA being

1

2

passed in 1974 and the Equity Amendment Act being passed

3

in 1990 the reverse was true, and for 16 years the Board

4

of Trade, for example, has been paying health insurance as

5

Workers Compensation because the Board of Trade otherwise

6

voluntarily provides the benefits to his employers.

7

then is passed, say, in 1990, and suddenly the Board of

8

Trade has responsibilities to the Federal Government,

9

reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary responsibilities

10

insofar as his health insurance benefits for active

11

workers are concerned.

ERISA

But I think this illustrates that although there

12

13

is some kind of connection, if you will, between our law,

14

because it governs health plans - -

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

MS. MURASKY:

And ERISA because it also governs

17

other health plans, in fact it really operates

18

independently of ERISA and is in no way dependant on

19

ERISA.

20

My second answer - -

21

QUESTION:

Well, it doesn't say that it has to

22

depend on ERISA.

The language of the statute is that they

23

are preempted insofar as they may now or hereafter relate

24

to any employee benefit plan.

the benefits here are measured by the level of benefits

MS. MURASKY:

They are measured -- the benefits

that our law requires are measured by benefits employers

otherwise require, and --

MS. MURASKY:

Well, I think what you're getting

7

to is the meaning of relate to, and I don't think this

8

Court has ever ruled -- it certainly hasn't ruled that any

9

reference to an ERISA-covered plan or any connection to an

20

ERISA-covered plan means that that statute is invalid.

21

What it has done is to preempt laws and only

22

laws that have one or more of the following features:

23

that they regulate the content of a plan, the

24

administration of a plan, a law that interferes with the

administration of a plan or calculation of benefits under

Well, sure, we've never had one

this case, but what you're saying is that it doesn't

MS. MURASKY:

QUESTION:

Well --

In a fairly close and substantial

way.

18

Now, maybe it's a bad idea.

Maybe the law

19

shouldn't be written that way, but it does say relate to

any plan.

21

MS. MURASKY:

I think the fact that certain

22

employee benefits provided to active workers in the

23

District are subject to ERISA doesn't change the

24

relationship between our statute and those benefits.

25

The focus of our statute is really on benefits.

Whether they're provided pursuant to ERISA-covered plans

2

or whether they're not, if Congress should decide

3

tomorrow, for example, to abolish ERISA insofar as

employee welfare benefits are concerned, our law could

still be in effect and it would operate independently of

QUESTION:

That would be true in the State

wrongful discharge action that was before the Court in

10

Ingersoll-Rand.

You could say the same thing.

The cause

11

of action, the termination tort, preceded ERISA, succeeds

12

ERISA, but while it's in force, it relates to ERISA.

13

MS. MURASKY:

14

a very different case.

15

emphasized that if ERISA had never been passed, if there

16

had not been this pension plan that was protected by

17

ERISA, the cause of action would not have existed, and in

18

fact what the employee was trying to do there was to use a

19

State common law cause of action to enforce a federally

20

created right, i.e., the right not to be terminated by an

21

employer in order -- so that an employer can avoid his

22

responsibilities under ERISA.

No, I think that Ingersoll-Rand is
In Ingersoll-Rand, this Court

in which an employee who was injured on the job, if he

2

could prove negligence and there were no affirmative

3

defenses available, could recover as damages --

4

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Murasky, I thought the

5

court said in the Ingersoll-Rand case that a State law

that is premised on the existence of an employee benefit

7

plan covered by ERISA is preempted, and I just don't see

8

how you get around Ingersoll-Rand.

plans.

13

provide otherwise to their active employees.

14

Our statute is not premised on ERISA-covered

What it is premised on is benefits employers

QUESTION:

Well, it's premised on a -- to the

15

extent that it's measured by --

16

MS. MURASKY:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. MURASKY:

That is true.

The ERISA plan benefits.
Well, it is measured by whatever

19

benefits employers provide to their employers, whether or

20

not these employers are otherwise subject to ERISA.

21

But to go back to the Workers - - the common law

22

analogy I was giving you, I think this would -- will make

23

very distinct the difference between the common law action

24

that our statute is trying to replace and the common law

25

action at issue in Ingersoll- Rand.

1

Let's look at a State such as Texas, in which

2

Workers Compensation is not mandatory and employers may

3

opt out of the Workers Compensation system but they're

4

otherwise subject to the common law tort remedies.

5

Everybody who has filed a brief in this case

6

agrees that in a case in which the employer is subject to

7

the common law that Workers Compensation basically

8

replaces, that worker may require, if he's injured on the

9

job, not only his wages but all lost benefits, including

10

11

health insurance benefits.

Everybody agrees upon that.

Our statute, what it does, I think, is to make

12

liability attach when there is a work-related injury.

13

Remedy is measured separately, but just as in the common

14

law Workers Compensation law liability attaches if there's

15

negligence, here it simply attaches if there's a work-

16

related injury.

17

We're just measuring a remedy here.

Now, if I could follow up, there was a recent

18

district court decision, I think, that may help to answer

19

your question and also illustrate some of the problems

20

that the States are facing in this area.

21

This is a case from Texas -- I think it's called

22

Urene against Wyatt Cafeterias - - in which you had an

23

employer who opted out of the Workers Compensation plan --

24

Workers Compensation law.

25

requirements on employers who opted out.

The law did impose some

An employee of Wyatt had a slip and fall and was

1

2

injured.

3

Cafeterias and the court - - the employer argued that the

4

common law cause of action was preempted by ERISA because

5

the employer had included in its ERISA-covered plan a

6

provision that governed job-related injuries.

7

She brought a negligence action against Wyatt

The trial court in that case first concluded

8

that this little ERISA plan in effect preempted --

9

preempted the Workers Compensation alternative.

On

10

reconsideration, what the court did was to say, look, this

11

is -- you know, since the employer has opted out of the

12

Workers Compensation system, this case is no different

13

from an ordinary tort case and the fact that the employer

14

has tried to, I guess, evade its responsibilities under

15

Workers Compensation law by passing this modest provision

16

in its ERISA-covered plan isn't enough to take it -- you

17

know, the State law still applies.

18

What the court did on reconsideration also was

19

to say that the plan benefits could be considered, but

20

only as an offset to the damages remedies, but that

21

employers cannot set up grounds for the purpose of evading

22

lawful State requirements.

23

But to go back to what I was saying, the Court

24

has never held a law like this one preempted, and it seems

25

to me that the Court should not attribute to Congress,

when everyone I think concedes except for the United

2

States -- attribute to Congress an intention of permitting

3

employers to require health benefit -- permitting

4

employers to require health benefits as part of Workers

5

Compensation but then saying that the only way you can do

6

it is in a way that is administratively difficult and that

7

doesn't comport with traditional Workers Compensation

8

principles, and that's what the D.C. circuit has held

9

here.

10

Unless there's further questions, I'll --

11

QUESTION:

But you would agree that this is a

12

covered plan, not an exempt plan, so that the analysis of

13

the Shaw case as given in the respondent's brief is

14

essentially correct, would you concede that point?
MS. MURASKY:

15

Let me say two things.

16

of Trade's plan, health insurance plan for active workers,

is an ERISA-covered plan.

argument you have nothing left.

19

MS. MURASKY:

Well, we have made two arguments.

The first is based on the R. R. Donnelley case and its

interpretation of Shaw, and on this Court's description of

Shaw in Metropolitan Life, and there the Court seemed to

say that when we have a Workers Compensation statute at

differently, and if an employer can comply -- comply with

I understand your second

what other statutory text can you possibly rely on for

It's just as though we're going to sit here and

we're going to impose a two-step process.

that -- or we shouldn't do that.

MS. MURASKY:

We can't do

Well, I think that certainly this

that statute was not preempted.

MS. MURASKY:

This Court has held that if it's a general

that if you single out the covered ERISA plan the law

If they wanted to say, look, any time there's a

Your Honor is

1

Then you have to look at, is that law -- does

2

that law in any way relate to a covered ERISA plan, and by

3

tying the benefits in this case to the health insurance,

4

that law then relates to a covered ERISA plan.

5

QUESTION:

Well, if a statute provides that the

6

employer shall provide $ 0,000, something like that,

7

health insurance for all of his employees, something along

8

the lines of Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, at the time

9

the law is passed there's no plan in existence that would

10

provide for that, is there?

11

MR. POSTOL:

12

QUESTION:

3

So the employer has to go out and

somehow put together a plan.

QUESTION:

8

MR. POSTOL:

9

No, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.
And you say that ERISA preempts that.
Yes.
Preempts the State law.

Why?

Because the benefits -- whatever

benefits the State required, if they dealt with health

20

benefits, then under the definition of 3( ) and 4(a),

21

those benefits that it requires are a covered ERISA plan.

22

In other words, a covered ERISA plan is not defined as

23

merely what the employer voluntarily provides.

24

ERISA plan is simply defined as certain types of benefits

25

that the employer provides, whether it's voluntary or

A covered

whether it's mandated.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. POSTOL:

Where did that definition come from?
Section 31 of ERISA and 4(a), which

4

Your Honor I believe is nicely set out in the Government's

5

Appendix.

6

So that that definition is not key to whether

7

it's voluntary or not, it simply says, if you give certain

8

benefits, one of which is health benefits, and the

9

employer provides them and it affects interstate commerce,

10
11
12

then that is a covered ERISA plan.
QUESTION:

And then therefore the State cannot

mandate something like that.

13

MR. POSTOL:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Mr. Postol, do you agree that the

15

plan in question here is maintained solely for the purpose

16

of complying with a State Worker's Comp law?

17

MR. POSTOL:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Despite the fact that it provides by

19

keying the health benefits it provides something which it

20

need not necessarily provide in order to comply with the

21

Worker's Comp law.

22

MR. POSTOL:

Yes.

The plan itself is maintained

23

solely for Worker's Compensation, so that plan that the

24

benefits of law requires is an exempt plan, and for that

25

reason, if they simply said we had to give $10,000 a month

7

MR. POSTOL:

Well, I think it's -- it's not the

purpose, it's that they tie -- they trigger the liability

9

and they tie the amount of the liability to a covered

10

12

13

ERISA plan.
QUESTION:

Well, that goes to relating to,

doesn't it?
MR. POSTOL:

Yes, but that's the point.

The law

14

relates to a covered ERISA plan.

The plan they require is

15

an exempt plan, but by defining what that exempt plan is,

16

their definition of it in the law is based on what the

17

covered ERISA plan is and therefore it relates to a

18

covered ERISA plan.

19

QUESTION:

You're saying that the law relates to

20

two plans, it relates to this plan that is created in

21

order to comply with the law, which is an exempt plan, and

22

the fact that it relates to that makes no difference.

I don't

8

think that affects the outcome of this case, whether

10

to make, and for two reasons.

11

realize that, you know, if you pay people enough money not

12

to work, they won't work, and secondly Worker's

13

Compensation is a compromise system, and that is, employer

14

gives up all its defenses, but in return it only gives a

limited remedy.

MR. POSTOL:

What will happen is that if an

employee wants to continue his health insurance, he will

continue it for

6

pay the premium, and that also goes to this question of

7

does this law relate to a covered ERISA plan, and it seems

8

to me our best argument is simply plain English, that to

9

say, you know, if you have a statute that triggers

8 months under COBRA, but he will have to

10

liability and bases the liability on the covered ERISA

11

plan, it has a connection with a reference to, but

12

Congress itself agreed with that, because they enacted

3

COBRA.

4

COBRA is part of ERISA, and COBRA provides for

5

continuation of health benefits, and that was the point in

6

the Government's amici brief in support of us, that there

7

could be little question that this law relates to a

8

covered ERISA plan, because Congress clearly showed that

9

by enacting COBRA.

The difference is, Congress wanted the

20

employees to have to pay for the benefits, whereas the

21

District of Columbia would rather have the employers pay

22

for it.

benefits, the benefits themselves are a covered ERISA

2

plan, so the State is saying you must provide a covered

3

ERISA plan, basically, therefore it's preemptive.

4

If it was across-the-board tax law, they're just

5

saying we're taxing everything in sight, we're not giving

6

you any special treatment pro or con to an ERISA statute,

7

I think then you get to the second question, is the effect

8

remote or peripheral, and if the effect is remote or

9

peripheral then the statute stands.

10

But to the extent the State does not single out

11

the ERISA plan for any special treatment, they're okay.

12

Now, the fact is that they may swallow it up, or -- you

you get to the second issue, is it remote or peripheral?

to the covered ERISA plan, and that's the great mistake of

this case, because what they will do then is encourage

employers not to provide those health insurance benefits

to begin with.

Oh, that's a different question.

I thought you said that that would be

okay.
MR. POSTOL:

No, Your Honor.

Again, if I --

8

footnote 7 in our brief, page 35, deals with that, and

9

what I said there was, that's a closer question, because

10

if could -- if they just said one-third of all benefits,

11

now I've got a general application statute, but then the

12

second question is, is the effect only remote and

13

peripheral, and I'm not so sure it is, and I would

14

certainly argue, if I had that case, that it isn't,

15

because unlike a tort remedy, where a tort remedy 1) is

16

very infrequent, it's not very predictable, and 2) it's

17

not the employer who pays a tort remedy, it's a

18

tortfeasor.

19

With Worker's Compensation, I know I'm going to

20

have those work injuries, I know how frequently they're

21

going to occur, and I pay for them as employer, so while

22

it's a closer question, I'd still be prepared to argue

23

then that was preempted, but for a different reason -- not

24

because it singled out the ERISA statute, but because it

25

would be a general applications statute, but then we get

1

to the second part of the test, and that is, is it remote

2

or peripheral, the effect.

3

QUESTION:

Yeah, but where it's different from

4

this case is that in this case you can say that it does

5

affect ERISA plans because an employer would be

6

disinclined to increase the amount of ERISA benefits.

MR. POSTOL:

QUESTION:

9

MR. POSTOL:

Yes, absolutely.
Whereas -But I'm not even sure that's part

10

of the test, because the remote and peripheral, if you

11

will, saving clause only deals with general application

statutes.

This Court has always said once it's specific,

once they single out ERISA coverage, it doesn't matter if

the effect is good and bad.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONNA M. MURASKY

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MS. MURASKY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

First of all, I'd like to point out that the

Equity Amendment Act does not single out ERISA-covered

1

plans for special treatment.

It treats ERISA-exempt and

2

ERISA-covered plans in the same fashion, and in this

3

respect it does differ from the statute that this Court

4

considered in Mackey, or the exemption to the garnishment

5

statute.

6

The only place in which our Worker's

7

Compensation law does mention ERISA-covered plans is of

8

course in the provision of our law that permits Worker's

9

Compensation benefits to be integrated with benefits

10

provided under ERISA-covered plans, and that statute is

11

cited at page 9, note 9 of our reply brief.

12

No one has suggested that this aspect of the

13

statute, which does specifically refer to ERISA-covered

14

plans, is preempted by ERISA.

15

2.

I think in this case the Board of Trade is

16

using ERISA as a sword to invalidate valid Worker's

17

Compensation laws and not as a shield.

18

abolish our Worker's Compensation system and allow

19

employers to be sued based on a showing simply of

20

negligence, and we could even eliminate the affirmative

21

defenses that an employer otherwise would have, all

22

employees who could -- who were injured on the job in the

23

District of Columbia and who could establish negligence,

24

or I suppose we could even employee a standard of strict

25

liability, each one of those employees could recover as

7

The last point I would like to - - two other

8

points.

There's some suggestion here that somehow our law

9

is invalid, our amendment is invalid because it's somewhat

innovative.

The Court rejected a similar argument not

11

only in Metropolitan Life but in the

12

Atomic Corporation against Miller.

That case is also interesting because it

involves a Worker's Compensation law and an unusual one

that was applied to the United States itself pursuant to a

congressional enactment.
