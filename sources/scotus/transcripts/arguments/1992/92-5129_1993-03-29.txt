CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Reed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN WILSON REED

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REED:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
When the State of Louisiana undertook to charge

11

and accuse John Sullivan with murder, John Sullivan had

12

the right to have the truth of that accusation determined

13

by a jury and to have the truth of that accusation

14

determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

15

When the State of Louisiana at trial undertook

16

to prove that accusation by reliance on a professed

17

accomplice, possibly beaten by the police at the time of

18

his arrest in return for his original statement, held in

19

jail for 2 years until the day of trial, and promised his

20

freedom, his immunity, and his release upon his giving

21

testimony in this case, John Sullivan had the right to

22

have the credibility of that witness, in light of the

23

other evidence of the case, tested and determined by a

24

jury, and tested and determined by a jury by the standard

25

of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

John Sullivan did not receive that right.

1

2

3 years ago, this Court held in Cage v. Louisiana that

3

John Sullivan had not received that right.

4

supreme court below held that John Sullivan had not

5

received that right, and below the State conceded that

6

John Sullivan had not received the right to a jury's

7

determination by the standard of proof beyond a reasonable

8

doubt because the jury instruction provided that a jury

9

could convict not only on a standard of proof lower than

The Louisiana

10

that required by due process but by a standard - - on a

11

standard of jury certainty below that required by due

12

process.

13

So John Sullivan comes before this Court on

14

direct appeal, on a conviction of murder, still subject in

15

further proceedings, to the possibility of a sentence of

16

death, without what this Court has called in Herrera a

17

judgment of legal guilt.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Reed, what was the disposition

19

made by the supreme court of Louisiana of the sentence

20

imposed on Sullivan?

21

MR. REED:

The Louisiana supreme court, Your

22

Honor, vacated the sentence of death on the grounds that

23

Mr. Sullivan's attorney had been ineffective in his

24

representation during the penalty phase and leaves to

25

further proceedings the possibility of reimposing that.

1

Presumably there will be a new sentencing proceeding, and

2

would be in the absence of action by this Court.
The jury in this case was not asked the right

3
4

question.

5

criminal trial is whether the defendant is guilty beyond a

6

reasonable doubt and whether the jurors possess that

7

subjective certainty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the

8

jury not having been asked the right question, necessarily

9

the jury by its verdict cannot be said to have answered

10

The question to be asked of a jury in a

that question.

11

The jury did not answer that question, and so

12

the case went before the Louisiana supreme court, where

13

the Louisiana supreme court, acknowledging the error,

14

answered the question itself, and that is what the Sixth

15

Amendment prohibits courts from doing by an application of

16

an ordinary kind of harmless error test, which I would

17

suggest was not applied in any way that could be

18

considered correct in this case in any event.

19

The Louisiana supreme court made its own

20

findings of credibility on a cold record, disregarded the

21

testimony the bartender eyewitness Lowrey, and instead

22

rested its -- its conclusion on the testimony of the

23

accomplice, Hillhouse, finding that the testimony of that

24

accomplice was unrefuted.

25

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Reed, if there were a case

1

in which the evidence were just crystal clear -- there's a

2

confession by the defendant, there are five eyewitnesses

3

who testified, there are finger print evidence and so

4

forth, no one could disagree that the evidence is

5

overwhelming - - is it possible in such a case that an

6

appellate court could review it and conclude that no

7

reasonable juror would have been able to do anything but

8

find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?

9

MR. REED:

Your Honor asks, of course, the

10

hardest question, and I think the principal answer to that

11

question, in light of the Sixth Amendment, has to be no,

12

so long as the defendant was in fact relying on the jury's

13

finding of facts beyond a reasonable doubt.

14
15

QUESTION:

Do you rely on the right of the jury

to nullify any verdicts --

16

MR. REED:

No, Your Honor, I do not.

17

QUESTION:

Any juror could --

18

MR. REED:

No.

19

QUESTION:

For any reason --

20

MR. REED:

No, I do not rely on jury

21

nullification.

22

here, but that is not an express part of our argument at

23

all.

24
25

I think that that lurks in the background

In a case such as the one Your Honor suggested,
if there were defenses that were raised by a defendant

1

perhaps of self-defense, perhaps of justification, perhaps

2

the Patterson v. New York kind of defense, the defense of

3

insanity, the defendant not only confesses but gets on the

4

witness stand and admits the elements of the offense, then

5

I would suggest you could apply a harmless error analysis

6

because in those cases the reasonable doubt fact-finding

7

process might not be relied upon by the defendant.

8

He might be relying on some affirmative defense

9

determined by a different standard, but I think principle

10

requires that in Your Honor's case that the Sixth

11

Amendment prohibit a finding of harmless error if the

12

defendant is indeed submitting questions of fact to the

13

jury by the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

14

It may be that there are such obvious cases.

15

They will be very few, I would think, and even when you

16

see cases where things are on videotape, nevertheless

17

people and juries and lawyers advocating cases to

18

juries --

19

QUESTION:

But Mr. Reed, in most States -- I

20

don't know if it's true in Louisiana or not -- the

21

defendant simply enters a plea of not guilty.

22

You don't deny the allegations, as I understand

23

it, in the indictment, and so the situation which you

24

advert to in answer to Justice O'Connor's question where

25

the defendant relies only on affirmative defense would be

a purely fictional one.
I mean, a defendant can always say he's just

2

3

putting the Government to its proof, can't he?

4

MR. REED:

If the defendant is, indeed, Your

5

Honor, putting the Government to its proof on the elements

6

of the offense and requiring it to prove them beyond a

7

reasonable doubt, then we would suggest that you cannot

8

apply harmless error in the ordinary way, but must instead

9

look to see whether he was relying on it and if he was

10

then it cannot be harmless.

11
12

13

QUESTION:

Look to see if he was relying on

MR. REED:

On the -- on the obligation of the

what?

14

State or the Government to prove beyond a -- if he made in

15

opening statements for Your Honor, the defendant comes

16

before you, admits he killed so-and-so, admits he

17

intentionally killed so-and-so, but tells you that he was

18

insane at the time, then I think a court could conclude

19

that that defendant was not relying on facts found beyond

20

a reasonable doubt if the insanity defense was placed --

21

the burden was placed - -

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Wouldn't a not-guilty plea ordinarily

be conclusive for the defendant?
MR. REED:

Well, initially a not-guilty plea

would certainly be the first step, and if that's all there

1

were before you, you might reach that conclusion, but when

2

you review it there is much more before you than just a

3

not-guilty plea.

4

There's the opening statements, there's the

5

evidence, there's the closing arguments, and you can

6

determine whether this is a case in which a defendant

7

indeed was putting the Government to its test to persuade

8

a jury fact-finder --

9

QUESTION:

But in your view, then, a defendant

10

would have to show something more than just a not-guilty

11

plea.
MR. REED:

12

No, Your Honor.

I would be obliged

13

to say that if a defendant pled not guilty and required

14

the Government to go through its proof and you could not

15

ascertain from opening statements or closing arguments

16

that there was reliance -- that there was not reliance on

17

the rule requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that

18

in that rare circumstance, if you didn't find counsel

19

ineffective or lots of other problems along the way, in

20

that rare circumstance you would have to find harmless

21

error.
QUESTION:

22

Mr. Reed, what is the difference

23

between other kinds of errors in the jury instruction and

24

this one?

25

because it incorrectly defines one of the elements of the

offense?

Would that always be a basis for automatically

2

setting it aside?
MR. REED:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

Why?

6

MR. REED:

As I would see it, only this, and the

3
4

I

think - -

7

reason why is because in every other circumstance that I

8

can contemplate, if there is an instruction on reasonable

9

doubt there will be before a reviewing court some findings

10

of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
Assume three elements, a misinstruction that

11
12

fails on one, a guilty verdict -- there are findings

13

beyond a reasonable doubt as to two elements.

14

logically, you may not, but you can apply it analytically,

15

say that having proved A beyond a reasonable doubt, there

16

may be such an necessary inexorable connection between A

17

and B that we can say as a matter of law that it was

18

harmless error, that there was a failure of instruction on

19

B.

You may

That is somewhat what was done in Pope, it's somewhat

Here, instead of having A proved beyond a

reasonable doubt, what can we say about B or C, you have

distinction between this and all other instructions.
They might come out differently in the analysis,

2

3

but you can subject them to the analysis.

4

cannot.

Here you

5

I would, if you will, go back to the language of

6

the harmless error rule, something that you can say beyond

7

a reasonable doubt did not contribute to the verdict,

8

something that you can say beyond a reasonable doubt

9

that's Chapman, or beyond a reasonable doubt did not

10

affect the fact-finding process, that's Van Arsdale.

11

How can something not contribute to the verdict

12

when it defines the verdict, it defines the question the

13

jury was asked and the answer that it gave, it -- in terms

14

of -- it affects the fact-finding process, it defines the

15

process they went through and, therefore, how can you say

16

beyond a reasonable doubt that it was harmless when it

17

defines it?

18

So in a sense you can - -

19

QUESTION:

Well, why wouldn't it be harmful only

20

if the -- if there was a reasonable likelihood that the

21

jury convicted on less than a reasonable doubt?

MR. REED:

Well, because, Your Honor --

MR. REED:

That's correct, Your Honor, and this

Court so found, and the question --

4

QUESTION:

In Cage.

5

MR. REED:

In Cage, Your Honor, yes, and this is

6

a virtually identical instruction, so this Court has held

7

that that's what this instruction does.

9

QUESTION:

Well, what if -- if you make an -- in

Estelle -- you know Estelle v. McGuire.

10

MR. REED:

Yes, sir.

11

QUESTION:

It says in these kinds of cases you

12

inquire whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the

13

jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that

14

violates the Constitution.

15

MR. REED:

Yes, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION:

And it sounds to me like we were

17

saying that if there was a reasonable likelihood, that's

18

the end of the case.

19

analysis involved.

20

MR. REED:

There's no separate harmless error

I think it's a matter of semantics,

21

Your Honor.

I could say there is no harmless error

22

analysis, period, because there's a reasonable likelihood

23

it affected because reasonable doubt was in Pope --

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

25

MR. REED:

Or you could say it the other way.

I

1

think the result is the same either way.
QUESTION:

2

But what if you conclude that there

3

wasn't any reasonable likelihood that the jury convicted

4

on less than reasonable doubt?

5

MR. REED:

Well, I think --

6

QUESTION:

There's no - - then there isn't any

7

error, I guess.

8

MR. REED:

But I think Cage --

9

QUESTION:

Harmless or otherwise.

10

MR. REED:

Cage defines that there is such

11

error.

12

Cage instruction is not an ambiguous instruction, Your

13

Honor, and the terms "could," "would," and "reasonable

14

likelihood" are terms of art used by this Court when its

15

interpreting an ambiguous instruction like Francis v.

16

Franklin, Boyde, McGuire --

17

There is the dispute about the language, but the

QUESTION:

Oh, I would think you would argue

18

that if Cage holds that, which it probably did, that there

19

is a reasonable likelihood that the jury convicted beyond

20

a reasonable doubt.

21

that forecloses any further harmless error analysis, and I

22

guess you do, don't you?

23

MR. REED:

That - - I would think you would argue

I certainly do, Your Honor.

I only

24

mean to consider some remote possibilities where it might

not apply, or not so remote, but as long as the ordinary

1

criminal case like John Sullivan, relying on the State's

2

requirement to prove the elements against him, defending

3

on the basis principally of identity, that that is the

4

seminal -- the key thing that a jury decides, and given

5

that instruction, there's a reasonable likelihood they

6

could, they would, they did.

7

It was a clear instruction before them that said

8

they only had to convict when they were convinced to a

9

grave uncertainty, not when they were convinced beyond a

10

reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

11

Of course, the State suggests that

12

this wasn't an ambiguous instruction at all, and it wasn't

13

an erroneous one, don't they?

14

MR. REED:

15

that question.

16
17

I think, Your Honor, Cage settles

That is, what --

QUESTION:

I know they do, but -- I know you

think so, but the State doesn't.

18

MR. REED:

Well, they take -- they do take

20

QUESTION:

Isn't that right, they assert that?

21

MR. REED:

They do, and I think the answer to

19

dispute - -

22

that - - I think the strength and the clarity of the Cage

23

opinion is in its unanimity, in the language of the

24

opinion in which the Court says it is plain to us that the

25

words mean something less than reasonable doubt, all nine

1

members of this Court, and it is clear to us that a jury

2

could.

3

I don't think there's any question that this

4

Court's interpretation in Cage is that this is not an

5

ambiguous instruction, it's a completely misleading one

6

that dilutes the standard of proof beyond a reasonable

7

doubt.
I would note that the words are identical.

8

9

There's some dispute about grave doubt, grave uncertainty.

10

In fact, the words "grave uncertainty" are used in both

11

instructions.

12

3 years have been following Cage and take it to mean what

13

it says.

14

The courts of the country for the last

What the Louisiana supreme court did could not

15

be defended under any basis of reasonable doubt analysis,

16

because it is their own fact-finding, and I would suggest

17

if you ever try a mode of approach to apply a factual

18

harmless error analysis, a whole record approach, you

19

would conclude that you became jurors yourselves arguing

20

about it, because if you had to approach it in any kind of

21

a way, you would have to consider whether it was beyond a

22

reasonable doubt that no rational juror could have held a

23

reasonable doubt.

24
25

And once you start considering those
possibilities, I think I could convince a majority of this

1

Court that a rational juror could have a rational --a

2

reasonable doubt, not only on the cold record but looking

3

at the way Mr. Hillhouse scowled, or did he scowl, or did

4

he sneer, or did he look down, or how did he look when he

5

said the things he said and when he came back on rebuttal

6

to add more things and more elements to the State's proof?

7

So when you try to start getting into that

8

process, even in Justice O'Connor's extreme case, you

9

start -- lawyers have defenses, clients have defenses, you

10

can argue about them, you can consider what the

11

possibilities are as they testify and as they present

12

themselves, and the Constitution refers, defers, and

13

reserves the decision of the credibility of those

14

witnesses to a jury.

15

QUESTION:

But of course, that kind of argument

16

was made against a whole notion of harmless error when it

17

was first introduced, but courts can't second-guess

18

juries.

19

this evidence been brought before it, even though rational

20

people would have said it didn't make much difference, but

21

that line of argument was rejected for the great majority

22

of harmless error applications saying that the principle

23

of harmless error was applicable.

24
25

We never know what a jury would have done had

And in every case, Your Honor, it was

conducted in light of and because there was before the

2

court a jury finding of something beyond a reasonable

3

doubt to that jury's certainty, and while I don't dispute

4

that there may be some subjectivity that might go into the

5

harmless error process of adding and subtracting to that,

6

there is the integrity of a jury finding beyond a

7

reasonable doubt.

9

QUESTION:

Well, suppose that we flesh out a

little bit Justice O'Connor's hypothesis and say that

10

there were four eyewitnesses, each to a murder with which

11

the defendant is charged.

12

extensively by defense counsel, and it only firms up the

13

witness' account -- those things do happen, as you know.

Each of them is grilled

14

MR. REED:

Yes.

15

QUESTION:

And the defense -- defendant does not

16

MR. REED:

9

But you're basing your argument on

I think the Sixth Amendment right to

jury trial forecloses the application of harmless error

10

analysis in any customary form where a defendant is

11

relying on the reasonable doubt instruction, but I would

12

like to say that there is more to the argument than just

13

the right to trial by jury, and that is that under the

14

Fourteenth Amendment, somebody is - - a defendant is

15

entitled not to be convicted except upon proof beyond a

16

reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the fact-finder.

17

That's part of the Winship formulation.

It is

18

the subjective degree of certainty of the fact-finder.

19

The opinions are the intensity of belief of the fact­

20

finder.

21

Reasonable doubt is not just a measuring

22

yardstick of the quantum of evidence.

As it was

23

emphasized in Jackson v. Virginia in both the majority

24

opinion and in the dissent, reasonable doubt is about the

25

certainty of the fact-finder.

If you go back to Duncan, Duncan speaks of the

right of a defendant to the jury's verdict.

The verdict

the structural, the fundamental, structural role of a

jury.

And in a case like this it is more telling than

ever, because you have a witness essentially created by

the Government, clothed with various immunities by the

determine whether that is a witness who should be believed

You know, there's been the evolution of the

3

presumption cases and the Pope case and the discussion of

4

how you can perform harmless error analysis with

5

instructional errors, but I think if you look at

6

Connecticut v. Johnson and Rose v. Clark, and Justice

7

Powell's opinions in those two cases and their evolution

8

through Carella and through Yates v. Evatt, the thread

9

that holds that all together and is always paid respect to

is reasonable doubt, a jury finding something beyond a

reasonable doubt.

12

Everybody in Connecticut v. Johnson and Rose v.

Clark agreed that the reasonable doubt was the touchstone

to any performing of a harmless error analysis.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The State of Louisiana has no quarrel with the

his right to have that jury determine his guilt or

I assure you that the State does not concede

that John Sullivan was convicted by a standard of proof of

MR. PEEBLES:

You are not bound, Your Honor,

because of Estelle v. McGuire.
In 1990, in Teague v. Louisiana, this Court

18

considered a jury charge similar to the one we have today,

19

and in Cage this Court held that a reasonable juror could

20

have interpreted the instruction to allow a finding of

21

guilt based on a degree of proof below that required by

22

the Due Process Clause.

23

But it's important to note that in Cage the

Court said that in construing the instruction, we consider

25

how reasonable jurors could have understood the charge as

3

possibility that they could have understood the language

in the jury charge to reduce the burden of proof standard

below that allowed by the Due Process Clause, you held

that Mr. Cage was entitled to a new trial.

You used the language, how they could have

Your Honor, if there was error

under Cage, and if you do not -- if you hold that the

error was as stated in Cage and do not apply Estelle v.

McGuire's criterion, then I think that this would not be

an error which would be subject to the harmless error

rule, because in Cage, the Court decided that the posture

of the case was such that the defendant was denied a

fundamental right.

QUESTION:

Mr. Peebles, I may not be following

the argument here, I must confess.

QUESTION:

I - - in your defense,

You did call that to our attention,

17

but if the instruction uses grave uncertainty in a way

that is a lesser standard of proof than proof beyond a

reasonable doubt, if one reads it that way, then does it

not necessarily follow under the language in Estelle that

there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the

analyze the issues and the evidence, and make a

13

determination as to whether there was overwhelming

14

evidence of guilt in this case.

15

QUESTION:

No evidence

But in effect that's an argument that

16

there was a sufficiency of evidence to find beyond a

17

reasonable doubt.

18

it, that the jury did find beyond a reasonable doubt.

19

It is not an argument, as I understand

MR. PEEBLES:

Well, we know that the jury did

20

find that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

21

question is whether the jury --

Excuse me.

correctly describing the reasonable doubt standard.
MR. PEEBLES:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

3

that, again, brings us back to the issue as to whether or

4

not that instruction correctly told the jury what it must

5

find in order to evaluate the evidence.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Peebles, what if no instruction

7

had been given at all on burden of proof in a criminal

8

case, just no instruction?

9

MR. PEEBLES:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. PEEBLES:

Now, could that be harmless?

No, Your Honor --

No.
It could not have been.

I'm sure

12

under Jackson v. Virginia the Court has said as much, and

13

in fact, if the jury --

14

QUESTION:

Well then, how would you have a

15

different result if the instruction that is given is

16

erroneous and doesn't present the right standard?

17

MR. PEEBLES:

If the instruction is erroneous

18

but nonetheless does not reduce the burden of proof beyond

19

a reason - - to that which is not permitted by the due

20

process clause, then the mistake would be harmless.

21

That's essentially what we're arguing in this case, Your

22

Honor, that those words about -- which have been

23

criticized do not cause the charge to become

24

unconstitutional.

Well, that takes you back to your

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN WILSON REED

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. REED:

Your Honors, there was one way to

16

apply the Cage instruction.

17

on less than reasonable doubt.

18

It was to permit a conviction

There is necessarily a reasonable likelihood

19

that it was applied in that way.

20

therefore, they were asked the wrong question and answer

21

and, necessarily, we can't apply harmless error, because

22

we would thereby be substituting our judgment for theirs,

23

which was not given and was not properly asked.

24
25

As necessarily,

Unless there are further questions, Your Honor,
I would submit the case.
