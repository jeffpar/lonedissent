ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY ALAN SEKULOW

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

MR. SEKULOW:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case is about censorship of Lamb's Chapel's

13

speech, which was entertained for the purpose of having a

14

film series at the school facilities to show and discuss

15

contemporary family issues.

16

religious purpose as an exclusion under the access policy

17

of the school district is both content based and viewpoint

18

based, and does not meet Constitutional scrutiny.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SEKULOW:

The direct targeting of

Under what?
Under -- well first of all, we

21

would assert that it's purely -- this case is based purely

22

on religious perspective, it's viewpoint based.

recently, R.A.V., but also under --

QUESTION:

1

So what -- what provision of the

2

Constitution are you relying on?

3

MR. SEKULOW:

4

States through the Fourteenth, freedom of speech.

QUESTION:

MR. SEKULOW:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SEKULOW:

9

First Amendment, as applied to the

Which part of it?
Free speech.

Just free speech.
Well, this case is based on three

issues when it was originally brought fourth in the

10

complaint.

11

clause, there was an allegation that there was a violation

12

of the establishment clause, and there was an allegation

13

that there was violation of free exercise.

14

The First Amendment's freedom of speech

And, quite frankly, the nature of the

15

discrimination that takes place here in the context of

16

Lamb's Chapel's application being denied violates all

17

three.

18
19
20

From the First Amendment perspective -QUESTION:

What did the -- what did the court of

appeals decide?
MR. SEKULOW:

The court of appeals came to the

21

conclusion that acknowledging that there were a wide

22

diversity of uses, which the respondents have conceded as

23

well, that, in fact, because there were no prior religious

24

uses, the -- the school district could then not allow

25

Lamb's Chapel to meet.

They held, in fact, that it was a

1

close question whether there was prior religious uses, but

2

determined, based on review of the Salvation Army being

3

there, the Southern Gospel Harmonizers, that it was no - -

4

there was no previous religious purpose in any meaningful

5

way.

6

QUESTION:

Well, as the case comes to us, do we

7

judge it on the basis that the court of appeals was

8

correct in saying that - - that this program had a

9

religious purpose?

10

MR. SEKULOW:

The respondents have --

11

petitioners have conceded Your Honor, Justice White, that

12

yes, the -- the movie series was dealing with contemporary

13

family issues from a -- a religious perspective and are

14

quite up front that it is for a religious purpose.

15

QUESTION:

All right.

16

MR. SEKULOW:

Our concern here, and I think what

17

is evident here, is that the viewpoint discrimination that

18

has been engaged in by the school district comes from

19

their own admissions.

20

the decision -- and I'm quoting from their brief.

21

decision to exclude petitioners was due to the admittedly

22

religious nature of the film and the school district's

23

prohibition against the use of school property for

24

religious purposes."

25

The respondents have stated that

They then state that, and again quoting,

"The

"Each

1

of these applications were denied due to the decidedly

2

religious perspective of the film."

3

If Lamb's Chapel Church desired to utilize

4

school facilities during noninstructional time in the

5

evening, pursuant to the school's access policy, and if

6

they determined to discuss the same issues, contemporary

7

family issues, with the sole exception being that they do

8

not make religious references or religious perspectives,

9

then Center Moriches could not object to allowing the

10

group to be there.
This isn't a case where we are arguing that a

11
12

school district must open its facilities to a broad array

13

of uses.

14

that they are opening their facilities to community use

15

for social, civic, recreational purposes and other uses

16

pertaining to the welfare of the community.

Here the school district, by policy, has stated

MR. SEKULOW:

19

They actually allow political

speech, however -QUESTION:

20
21

What about political speech?

What does the -- what does the rule

say?
MR. SEKULOW:

The rule says this, that political

place.

1

organization, then there would have to be a vote of the

2

district to determine whether, in fact, that group could

3

meet, which I think presents another Constitutional issue

4

which is not one that we're -- we're concerned with today,

5

but I think it points to the problem.

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but religious speech is

not the only speech that is at least presumptively barred.
MR. SEKULOW:

Political speech by a party has to

go through an admission process, if you will.

So - - but

10

here, and I think what's relevant here is this is not a

11

question of where, Justice White, they've eliminated or

12

construed their statute to remove the subject matter of

13

family issues from the permissible speech.

14

question of whether the speech topic was permissible, nor

15

is this really a question of whether the group was

16

entitled to access.

17

This is not a

Clearly the admission policy, the use policy of

18

the school district states that it is open to not-for-

19

profit outside groups.

20

they have conceded, based on its content, the nature of

21

the film, its viewpoint, its perspective.

22

allowed, in other existing uses, several discussions on

family issues.

Here the exclusion was based --as

And they've

QUESTION:

1

You would --on your view, you would

2

also be entitled to win, wouldn't you, if we don't accept

3

your characterization of it as viewpoint based, but held

4

it to be content based.

5

wouldn't you?

6

MR. SEKULOW:

7

QUESTION:

On your theory, you'd still win,

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

So that if we said what was excluded

8

was simply discussions of religion or religious

9

proselytization, you would still, on your viewpoint, win.
MR. SEKULOW:

10

Certainly, especially in the

11

context of the policy that the school district has adopted

12

here.

13

which, as I said, opens its facilities to social, civic,

14

recreational use and other uses pertaining to the welfare

15

of the community.

16

believe the religious perspective, religious discussions,

17

serve civic, social, and welfare of the community needs.

18

So --

The -- the school district has adopted a policy

19

QUESTION:

Our submission is quite clear that we

But what if the school district had

20

adopted a policy of excluding both religious and political

21

speech on the grounds these tend to cause controversy and

22

arguments and we'd just rather stay away from them?

23

MR. SEKULOW:

I -- I still would say, Mr. Chief

24

Justice, that that would not -- could not justify the

25

exclusion.

Because the policy here, in its beginning,

civic, recreational purposes.

or religious perspective on social, civic, and welfare of

the community needs is relevant, and there's no basis upon

MR. SEKULOW:

I think the religious view

Well --- Unless, of course, a compelling

interest could be shown.
QUESTION:

Could -- could -- could the State

10

exclude only partisan political speech and say that we

11

just don't want to get into that sort of thing?

12

MR. SEKULOW:

I think that brings up a different

13

question, but here the -- the free exercise issue would

14

come up and I think an establishment clause issue comes up

15

in the context of our case.

QUESTION:

about the political question --

MR. SEKULOW:

I think that political --

But didn't answer, yeah.
Political speech is appropriate in

the designation that the school district has adopted.

24

Could a school district adopt one that narrowly tailors

25

and says no political speech because of our concerns?

You talk about free exercise.

We're

And

A prohibition --

That's the question you've been

asked.

17

MR. SEKULOW:

Justice Kennedy, if there was a

18

prohibition on just political speech, I think it suffers

19

the same Constitutional defect.

20

some type of compelling interest here to justify the

exclusion, especially when the subject matter is a valid

topic.

MR. SEKULOW:

No -- no I'm not, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

Well it seems to me that's what

you're saying.
MR. SEKULOW:

No.

What we're saying is this.

The school district here has adopted a policy that states

10

that social, civic, recreational uses and other uses

11

pertaining to the welfare of the community can take place.

12

They've made the affirmative determination that, in fact,

13

those type of activities can take place.

14

A school district certainly can --a school

15

district could close its facilities.

they're not being compelled to open them --

QUESTION:

Hum.

MR. SEKULOW:

-- The question here is not

whether political speech can take place, because under the

policy political speech can take place.

The exclusion is

1

that suffers from Constitutional defects as well.
QUESTION:

2

Also, by the same token would you say

3

that if they -- they could not exclude a -- a religious

4

service, for example.

5

celebrate a mass or a baptism or something like that,

6

could the -- I presume, by a parity of reasoning, that

7

could not be excluded.

8

MR. SEKULOW:

If an outside group wanted to -- to

I think under the policy that's

been adopted, Justice Souter, that removing a service,
10

religious service, would suffer the same Constitutional

11

problems.

12

14

service.

16

And I would state that what this Court said in
In Widmar the Bible

There were hymns, there was singing, there were

17

a school district that decides to open its facilities --

18

as I said, they don't have to open their facilities,

1

they've decided to open their facilities -- can then parse

20

the speech so closely to determine when religious speech

21

crosses the line, if you will, to a religious service.

22

QUESTION:

But are -- are you accepting the --

23

the ultimate premise of the other side that they can, in

24

fact, define the extent to which they open it up?

I think they can in the extent of

the extent to which they have opened them.

apparently isn't your argument and you're now saying

they've got to open the doors wide.

MR. SEKULOW:

QUESTION:

7

MR. SEKULOW:

8

But that

Absolutely not, Justice Souter.

Then how do we draw the line?
Let me make -- let me make the

position -- what we're saying is this.

The school

district here has elected to open its facilities and
10

they've conceded to a wide diversity of uses.

11

targeted the religious purpose speech for exclusion.

12

have conceded that the religious exclusion in our case is

13

based on the perspective of the film series and its

14

religious nature, that's their concessions.

15

They have
They

Once you have an - - a governmental municipality

16

organization opening up its facilities to social, civic,

17

recreational uses and other uses pertaining to the welfare

18

of the community, they cannot then close it because of a

1

religious perspective.
QUESTION:

20

Is your -- is your theory, Mr.

21

Sekulow, that you cannot pick on religion, that -- that --

22

that if religion is just one of many things excluded it's

23

okay.

MR. SEKULOW:

No.

1

or one of only a couple of things excluded, it's not okay.
MR. SEKULOW:

2

My position is -- this is my

3

position, that when you open up a school district -- when

4

a school district elects to open up its facilities for

5

community use for such uses as social, civic, and welfare

6

of the community needs, you cannot exclude the religious

7

perspective.
QUESTION:

8

9

Because that includes too many

needs.
MR. SEKULOW:

10
11

Why?

No, because the religious

perspective is relevant to civic concerns.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SEKULOW:

viewpoint discrimination is here.

MR. SEKULOW:

I think perhaps a school district

7

would then have to assert that the health concerns -- and

8

now, again, this is another situation not precisely --or

9

really very remote from our case - - but where maybe the

10

school district could come up with some compelling

interest to justify medical exclusion based on that.

But that's not what happened here, and this is

not a case where they're advocating illegal activity,

They - - they say religious advocacy is only good to those

17

It's the position of the respondent in this

case, the Center Moriches School District and the

president of the board, that they have denied access to

20

the petitioners in this case based upon a well tailored

21

State statute, the New York State Education Law, section

414, and a series of regulations promulgated under that

23

statute.

in the uses that we have permitted.

And we further submit that we have -- in the

We submit that the petitioner is erroneous --

6

7

has taken an erroneous position in looking at this

8

particular film series as being part of a larger picture,

9

namely the use of the facility for social, educational,

10

and community welfare activities.

11

In fact, if you -- if you look at the record,

12

both in the district court from the testimony of Pastor

13

Steigerwald and the submission of Pastor Steigerwald in

14

his third application for the use of the premises, in both

15

of those instances he's indicated that he is not prepared

to abide by the regulation of the district, and, in fact,

he intends to use the facility for educational institution

proselytization or urging somebody to adopt a particular

religion, if you open the forum to a particular religious

I think the result in Widmar

MR. HOEFLING:

-- That Lamb's Chapel wants to

QUESTION:

to decide whether this - - whether this is going to be

Your Honor, we submit that they

MR. HOEFLING:

QUESTION:

3

We submit that

And -- and -- and that is the -- so

you're never going to avoid your entanglement problem.

4

MR. HOEFLING:

Your Honor, we submit that there

5

are often situations in which questions must be asked of a

6

religious group, at least on the surface, to see if they

7

qualify for certain tax benefits or certain other

8

entitlements, but that doesn't necessarily involve

9

entanglement.
But when we get to the point where we are

10
11

prescreening what they're going to show to see whether or

12

not it's too religious or too close to a mass or a

13

service, too close to proselytizing, that becomes a very

14

difficult issue and really does create entanglement

15

problems for the district.
QUESTION:

16
17

Is there a difference between speech

with a religious viewpoint and a religious exercise?
MR. HOEFLING:

18

Again, I suspect that depends on

19

the nature of the speech, Your Honor, and it's an issue

20

that the school district would rather not get involved in

21

screening.
QUESTION:

22

Well, the Constitution itself talks

23

about free exercise, so might not that be a workable

category?

6

QUESTION:

But in a

The problem is -- is that if you

7

define religion -- a limited forum in terms of content, it

8

can be self-defeating because the whole idea of limited --

9

of -- of a public forum of some kind is to allow for the

10

expression of speech, so you have to be very careful that

11

you're not just engaging in a circular definition.

12

MR. HOEFLING:

I understand that, Judge, but

13

I -- Your Honor, Justice Kennedy, I think that if you look

14

at the picture that this Court has drawn, the framework

15

that this Court has put together through the years from

16

Greer and Widmar and Perry and the cases that outline

17

forum analysis, I think it is a useful framework for the

18

school district and for other local government officials

19

to govern what they can and cannot do without running into

20

Constitutional problems in the free speech area.

21

QUESTION:

Under some of our cases talking about

23

Court has said that reasonable and neutral limitations can

24

25

religious content is reasonable and neutral?

That's a little hard to propose.

I'd

like you to explain that.
MR. HOEFLING:

Yes, Your Honor.

We submit that

it's neutral because, in fact, nobody with a religious
perspective is permitted to use the facility in terms of
proselytizing their faith.
QUESTION:

But people with an antireligious

viewpoint are, and so you think that's neutral.
MR. HOEFLING:

You did with Justice Stevens a few

minutes ago and I understood you to confirm that.
MR. HOEFLING:
