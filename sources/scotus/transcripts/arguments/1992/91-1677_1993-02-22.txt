ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under the funding rules established by ERISA,

Keystone Consolidated Industries owed $9.6 million to the

13

pension trust it sponsored in 1983.

17

next year it contributed real estate to partly satisfy its

18

funding obligation to the plan.

19

Keystone lost $21

Instead, it contributed five truck terminals to
The

Now, Keystone recognized that these transfers of

20

property were sales or exchanges for purposes of the

21

income tax laws, but Keystone maintains that they are not

QUESTION:

So, this was acceptable to the trust

to accept the assets in this form.
MR. WRIGHT:

In this case, the trustee, who is

11

also a director of Keystone Consolidated Industries,

12

accepted the property.

13

QUESTION:

You mentioned the director.

Is there

14

any claim that the -- I mean, does that make a difference

15

in the legal issue whether the director is one who might

16

not be totally independent or something like that?

17

MR. WRIGHT:

No.

There might also be a

18

fiduciary duty breach action in a case of this sort.

In

fact, many such breaches were alleged and found by the

20

district court in some related litigation, but this issue

trustee has -- is an independent person and, B, has the

3

authority to refuse to take anything except cash?

4

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes.

Yes, and it's probably the

case that the trustee probably should have refused to

accept this property.

It's not in this particular case.

That's right.

MR. WRIGHT:

1

No, Your Honor.

The capital gain

- - Keystone acknowledged that this is a sale or exchange

3

under the capital gain provision.

4

Under anyone's interpretation, the tax consequences of

5

this contribution to Keystone are the same here.

We agree with that.

If I may return to your earlier point, however,

6

7

one of the key things I'd like to make clear here this

8

morning is that subsection (c)(1)(A) and the other

9

prohibited transaction rules are phrased categorically.

10

There is no question that even if a sale is for fair

11

market value and everyone agrees, the language of the

12

statute which prohibits any direct or indirect sale or

13

exchange between an employer and a pension plan prohibits

14

that transaction.

15

QUESTION:

16

would the Congress so provide.

17

MR. WRIGHT:

What I'm trying to get at is why

Oh.

I think Congress made that

18

clear.

19

rule, which had prevailed prior to ERISA, with this

20

categorical rule because transactions of this sort are

21

inherently susceptible to abuse.

22

It was replacing the arm's-length transaction

You have already suggested one of the ways that

23

abuse occurs and, in fact, did occur in the Wood case, the

24

Fourth Circuit case where the court reached the conclusion

25

that the Government agrees with.

In that case, the

1

employer intentionally overvalued the property it

2

contributed to its plan.

3

QUESTION:

While I have you interrupted, was

4

either this case or the Wood case in the tax court

5

reviewed by the full court?

6

MR. WRIGHT:

7

QUESTION:

No, no.

No, Your Honor.

Mr. Wright, I take it that the IRS

8

manual until 1989 indicated that a transfer such as this

9

was allowable.
MR. WRIGHT:

10

Not exactly, Your Honor.

What the

11

IRS manual said was that - - and let me make clear that

12

this is, of course, an in-house manual intended for

13

auditors, and everyone agrees it has no legal binding

14

authority.

15

What the manual said was -- first, it had a

16

sentence that said that if the terms of a plan allow, a

17

pension plan may accept property.

18

It said, for instance, a profit sharing plan may accept

19

stock from the employer.

20

Now, those --

21

QUESTION:

22

It then had an example.

Did the terms of this plan allow the

transfer?

23

MR. WRIGHT:

24

And, in fact, another point that I want to make

25

Not as far as I know, Your Honor.

clear today is that there is a big difference in the

1

pension area between defined benefit plans, the sort of

2

plans Keystone sponsored, and defined contribution plans

3

like profit sharing plans, the plan discussed in the

4

example in the manual.

5

QUESTION:

Well, was there anything in this plan

6

that addressed the subject of the nature of the annual

7

contribution?

8

9

MR. WRIGHT:

Not as far as I know, Your Honor.

We would take the position that if a defined benefit plan

10

allowed contributions of property to fulfill funding

11

obligations, that that provision of the plan would be

12

contrary to the terms of ERISA.

13
14
15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, the manual didn't really refer

to that distinction.
MR. WRIGHT:

No.

No, Your Honor, it did not,

but the example - QUESTION:

And so, if anyone -- if any taxpayer

18

were looking at the IRS' own manual, they would have

19

thought that if the pension accepted this property, it

20

would have been all right?

21

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, Your Honor, I think that if

22

anyone went through the IRS manual, they should have been

23

alerted by the example which discussed a defined

24

contribution plan, and they should have -- it is our

25

position that contributions of property may well be

differ from --

3

QUESTION:

4

there's no sale or exchange?

5

MR. WRIGHT:

6

QUESTION:

7

Those plans

Why is that, Mr. Wright?

Yes, Your Honor.

Because

A --

There is no sale or exchange because

there's no obligation to contribute.

8

MR. WRIGHT:

9

QUESTION:

Exactly.
Isn't there an obligation to

10

contribute some way or other than in the plan, i.e., the

11

trust instrument itself?

12

MR. WRIGHT:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WRIGHT:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WRIGHT:

In a defined contribution plan?
Yes.
Frequently, no, Your Honor.
They're just making gratuitous gifts?
They are not gratuitous gifts

17

because they're deferred compensation to the employees,

18

but as far as the plan is concerned, they're gratuitous

19

gifts.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

But they're deferred compensation

because they're obligated under some contract -MR. WRIGHT:

No, Your Honor.

The way defined

23

contribution plans are frequently established is that the

24

employer basically sets up individual accounts for each

25

participant.

Now, the plan may call for -- it may call

for no contributions at all.

It may simply set up a

2

mechanism for distributing whatever contributions are

3

made.

4

contributed each year.

It may also call for a percentage of profits to be

5

But these plans also almost always allow for

6

excess contributions if the employer wants to contribute

7

more than it has promised, if in fact it has promised

8

anything.

Those sorts of contributions are not required

by any contract with the pension plan or any contract at
10
11

all.

And so - QUESTION:

Is it characteristic in those cases

12

that there is no provision in the plan for crediting any

13

excess contributions to -- let's say, to a future year's

14

obligation, if there would be an obligation?

15

MR. WRIGHT:

Your Honor, in a defined

16

contribution plan, there is no future year's contribution

17

Section 412 of title 26, which sets out the minimum

18

funding rules, applies only to defined benefit plans, the

1

sorts of plans Keystone sponsored.

20

individual account plans.

It has no bearing on

21

Let me add in this connection --

22

QUESTION:

But the contract can provide, I mean

23

whether the statute provides it or not.

24

provide for future year payments.

25

The contract can

Let's assume one that says you shall make this

1

much of a contribution every year, and you may, in

2

addition, make whatever beyond that you wish.

3

one, the employer makes the minimum plus a lot.

4

the question asked is whether that excess can be credited

5

to the next year's.

6

terms of the contract, wouldn't it?

7

So, in year
I think

That would be entirely up to the

MR. WRIGHT:

That would be, Your Honor.

Now,

8

I'm told that in many of these plans, what's -- if

9

something is mandated, what's mandated is a percentage of

10

profits each year.

11

presumably you wouldn't be able to credit those for future

12

years.

13

So, in that particular situation,

But let me say in this connection that defined

14

contribution plans are not some tail wagging the dog here.

15

They actually outnumber defined benefit pension plans and

16

are a very important part of the pension scheme here.

17

QUESTION:

Well, in --

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Wright,

(c)(1)(A) talks about

19

prohibited transactions, and there's a tax imposed on them

20

of 5 percent.

21

prohibited transactions other than that they are taxed at

22

a rate of 5 percent?

23

Are there any other consequences of

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, if Keystone -- there's an

24

additional tax if Keystone doesn't ultimately correct the

25

transaction.

It's actually a 100 percent tax, but

1

Keystone can correct the transaction even after it loses

2

in this Court.

3

100 percent tax will ever get levied.

4

So, in fact, it's very unlikely that the

There could be a fiduciary breach action, as I

5

think I've already indicated, against the fiduciary

6

alleging that it should not have accepted the property.

7

QUESTION:

That would -- that could be based on

8

the fact that that was a prohibited transaction under the

9

Internal Revenue Code?
MR. WRIGHT:

10

It certainly could, and even

11

independent of that, it could be based on the fact that

12

the fiduciary simply shouldn't have accepted this sort of

13

property.

14

In this particular case, the truck terminals

15

were quite illiquid, although the -- I think the reason

16

Keystone didn't sell them and contribute the proceeds,

17

which is what the Government thinks an employer should do,

18

is because it was trying to sell them.

19

sell.

20

immediately, but it took 3 and a half years for the plan

21

to sell one of the truck terminals.

They were hard to

In fact, the pension trust tried to sell them

And, of course, in addition, two of the truck

22

terminals were subject to exclusive listing agreements

calling for the payment of 5 percent sales commission to

brokers.

And, Justice Blackmun, I was trying to get this

1

2

out as a second example of what Congress was clearly

3

concerned about in this area.

4

understand, straight abuse of overvaluing the property,

5

what Keystone, in effect, did here was find a buyer for

its truck terminals and transfer the transaction costs of

QUESTION:

May I ask?

Besides the more easy to

and they had five terminals, each worth $100,000 fair

market value, and they transferred all five of them.

13

Would the four that were not necessary to discharge the

14

obligation also be sales or exchanges within your --

15

Supposing the funding obligation was $100,000

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, and let me say that that's a

16

harder issue that's not presented in this case.

17

Fifth Circuit said in this case -- in the Fifth Circuit,

18

we concentrated on defined benefit plans, and we said,

19

look it, this is an easy case.

The contribution here

20

fulfills a funding obligation.

Under the black letter law

21

for 50 years in the tax area, it's a sale or exchange.

22

And the Fifth Circuit said, well, any contribution to a

23

defined benefit plan necessarily satisfies a funding

24

contribution, if not this year, next year.

25

overlooked defined contribution plans.

Now, the Department of Labor -- under the

8

division of authority, it's the Department of Labor that

9

actually has the primary responsibility among the three

10

agencies that administer ERISA for construing this

11

provision.

12

before the transactions at issue, it issued an opinion

13

letter in a case indistinguishable from this one in all

14

respects saying that the contribution of property to a

15

defined benefit plan to satisfy a funding obligation is a

16

prohibited sale or exchange.

17

And it has issued -- in 1981, that is, 2 years

In 1990, it issued an opinion letter discussing

18

a voluntary contribution to a defined contribution plan of

19

the sort I have talked, a contribution that fulfills no

current or future funding obligation.

QUESTION:

How did it deal with section -- what

MR. WRIGHT:

It explained that the -- that

So, that's

Mr. Wright, do you take the position

14

that the DOL opinion letter is a formal interpretation of

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

And let me say that - - I meant to say in

response to your earlier question that as between the

is intended to inform people how the agency that

MR. WRIGHT:

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Wright --

8

QUESTION:

In the case where an excess amount of

property is contributed, an amount of property over and
10

above the employer's obligation, does the employer have a

11

deduction for that additional amount?

12

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Your Honor, and it has a

13

deduction because it's a transfer of property.

14

employers argue that that is a gift, but usually,

15

certainly in the case of large employers like Keystone,

16

the IRS almost always maintains that, in fact, what

17

-happens is it's a transfer of property between the

18

employer and the employees.

1

absolutely no right to the money and no right to insist

20

upon it, it's nevertheless a form of deferred compensation

21

to the employees, and it is deductible.

One other question.

MR. WRIGHT:

2

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
Suppose there's a mortgage on the

3

property that he assumes.

4

exchange?

5

MR. WRIGHT:

Is that then become a sale or

No, Your Honor.

In some certain

6

circumstances, there are tax consequences.

In the unusual

7

case where the basis in the property is actually less than

8

the mortgage, then there is some gain to the transferor,
but in a normal case where the property is worth much more

10

than its mortgage and the basis is worth more than the

11

mortgage, that -- that's simply a gift.
The example we've used is that if a father gives

12

13

80,000 -- property worth $80,000 to a child, that's a

14

gift.

of which prohibit any direct or indirect sale or exchange

There is also overlap between subsection

So, in a sense,

what the IRS is stating is that this taxpayer ought to be

14

Second, and perhaps more important, the

15

Department of Labor '81 advisory opinion contains within

16

it a false assumption, and that assumption is that code

section 412 imposes a cash obligation upon the taxpayer.

18

The way that advisory opinion analyzes the issue, it

states that the transfer of property to a plan that has a

20

legal right to receive cash is tantamount to a sale.

21

Whether or not there is a cash obligation is

answered by code section 412.

MR. WEXLER:

The maximum criminal

MR. WEXLER:

It would be a prohibited transaction,
I mean, that's no

No, no, no, but I think that if the

statute is penal in nature, then it is a statute that

ought not assess a tax unless it is fairly clear on the

that the employer must satisfy a minimum funding standard,

following language:

The very next

subsection in 4975(c) is called (a)(1)(B) instead of (c),

and what that provides is a prohibition against the

employer.

6

What the legislative history of that section

stated was that one of its purposes was to disallow an

employer from funding his obligations with a promissory

note, the reason being a promissory note would then create

10

the prohibited lending.
We would submit that that sentence is also, just

like (f)(3), irreconcilable with the theory that Congress

I would suggest that if 412

want.

13

I would also state that if 412 had a rule that

said all contributions must be made in cash, we would not

be here either, and the reason is we wouldn't have a case

because in discharge for cash, it's clearly a sale.

-- say, Mr. Wright, the language,

sale or exchange or leasing, the words leasing coming
