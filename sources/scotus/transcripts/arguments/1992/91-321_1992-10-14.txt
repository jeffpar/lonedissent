ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP W. COLLIER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COLLIER:

10

11

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

12

The issue in this case is whether Tennessee's

13

sales tax imposed on Itel's Federally bonded containers

14

dedicated exclusively to use in foreign commerce is

15

prohibited by the 1956 and 1972 treaties on containers, as

16

well as the body of Federal implementing regulation, and

17

the foreign commerce and import - export clauses of the

18

Constitution.

19

At the time Tennessee imposed its tax,

Itel was

20

one of the largest container leasing companies in the

21

world.

22

across the United States and an additional 129 locations

23

around the globe; but only one government in the world

24

imposed a tax on Itel's containers, Tennessee.

25

United Kingdom and other nations have noted, none of the

Itel delivered its containers at 98 locations

As the

1

59 nations which have signed the two container treaties

2

impose any form of sales or use taxation on containers.

3

But it is not the language here of Tennessee's

4

taxing statute which is unique.

5

application of that statute to tax container leases.

6

Indeed, 44 of Tennessee's sister States and many of the

7

signatory nations to the container treaties impose some

8

form of sales or use taxation on lease transactions.

9

Instead, it is the

But it not mere coincidence that no other

10

government in the world imposes sales or use tax

11

equivalents on containers.

12

alone here is that the imposition of its tax is prohibited

13

by the container treaties, runs counter to the custom of

14

nations, and is at odds with this Court's logic in the

15

Japan Line decision.

16

The reason that Tennessee acts

There are three related, but independent grounds

17

for reversal here.

18

special transitory nature of Federally bonded containers

19

dedicated exclusively to use in foreign commerce.

20

both the terms and the policies of the container treaties

21

and the implementing Federal regulation prohibit the tax,

22

and the application of the tax by Tennessee offends the

23

principles of the foreign commerce clause by creating a

24

substantial and genuine threat of foreign retaliation and

25

because of the risk of multiple taxation.

Each ground shares in common the

Finally,

First,

1

Tennessee's tax is a prohibited tax on goods in transit

2

under the logic of the import - export clause of the

3

Constitution.

4

Now, the issue of whether the terms of the

5

container treaties prohibit Tennessee's tax presents a

6

direct confrontation between the United States and 14

7

nations, including three of the United States' largest

8

five trading partners, Japan, Germany, and the United

9

Kingdom.

The United Kingdom, a primary drafter of the

10

1956 treaty, and the other protesting nations concur with

11

Itel's reading of the express terms of the convention that

12

Tennessee's tax is prohibited because it is imposed in

13

connection with or by reason of the containers'

14

importation.

15

have withheld the application of their taxes in reliance

16

upon these treaties' obligations.

17

These protesting nations point out that they

Now, the position taken by the United States

18

today, that the treaties prohibit only the imposition of

19

customs duties and not State taxes, is at odds and is a

20

complete reversal of its position taken in 1978 before

21

this Court in Japan Line.

22

today of the treaties' language must be viewed and

23

consider -- must be viewed and considered in light of that

24

interpretation.

25

QUESTION:

So, certainly the reading given

How do you interpret this tax to be

1

imposed to be chargeable by reason of importation?

2

the language of the conventions that we're dealing with.

3

MR. COLLIER:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

That's

The concept

4

of importation, as described in the convention, not only

5

connotes a temporal event, such as the crossing of a

6

border, but indeed, the status of the containers as they

7

remain within the borders of a signatory nation.
QUESTION:

8

9

You cannot tax anything that has been

imported?
MR. COLLIER:

10

You cannot tax a container once it

11

has been temporarily imported and remains subject to the

12

protection of the treaties.

13

QUESTION:

It doesn't say by reason of temporary

14

importation.

15

by reason of importation.

16

It says by reason of importation, chargeable

Now, there are two ways to read it, it seems to

me.

upon the importing.

19

it -- importing is a but-for cause of the tax.

20

wouldn't have been hit with the tax if you hadn't

21

imported.

22

all imported goods are free from property taxes, sales

23

taxes, all sorts of taxes.

24

can you?

25

One is, the tax is upon the act of importing.

It is

And the other way to read it is
You

But if you read it the latter way, my goodness,

MR. COLLIER:

You can't read it that way,

First of all, I would agree with

you, Justice Scalia, that there are two readings which

2

might be given to this tax.

3

them, but both meanings are incorporated into the treaty

provisions.

imposition of all taxes on imported goods, but addresses

6

containers which are crossing borders and moving into the

7

interior of a nation.

9

First, the treaty does not prohibit the

QUESTION:

8

You've identified each of

Where does it address those?

Does it

mention them?
MR. COLLIER:

10

Yes.

The 1956 treaty tax

11

prohibition covers -- and I quote -- not only customs

12

duties, but also all duties and taxes whatsoever

13

chargeable by reason of importation.

14

of temporary admission given in the 1956 treaty applies to

15

containers and the importation of those containers into

the interior pass -- crossing the border of a nation.

19

QUESTION:
imported.

And the definition

Well, that just proves that they're

A lot of other things are imported as well.
MR. COLLIER:

A number of other things are

20

imported, but the treaties on containers cover taxes on

21

containers, not merely the goods imported in containers.

22

And so, the treaties' application is limited to those

23

containers and a tax on those containers.

24
25

The definition of temporary admission, set forth
in article 1(b) of the treaty of '72, describes temporary

admission to mean temporary importation subject to

reexportation.
QUESTION:

4

if the container happens to be there on the lien date?

6

Is a general property tax permissible

MR. COLLIER:

If the tax is imposed by reason of

importation - -

7

QUESTION:

Well, I'm -- that's what I'm trying

8

to test.

Suppose the State says that all personal

9

property here on March the 15th shall be taxed.

10

MR. COLLIER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. COLLIER:

Yes.

And the container is assessed a tax.
Yes, Justice Kennedy, I do believe

13

that under the treaties a property tax based upon presence

14

would be by reason of importation to that jurisdiction.

15

QUESTION:

And that's because the container

16

couldn't have been there but for the importation and,

17

therefore, this tax must be by reason of importation.

18

that your train of logic?

19

MR. COLLIER:

20

that's a fair summary.

21

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

Is

I think

And, indeed, the United States in 1978 in its

22

brief pointed out to this Court that containers which have

23

crossed the international border and entered the domestic

24

commerce of a nation are considered to be absent.

They're

of a nation.

2

QUESTION:

Well, the Government is certainly-

3

taking a different position today, and it's saying that

4

the convention means that Tennessee's tax is collected in

5

connection with and chargeable by reason of sales, not by

6

reason of importation.

7

the Government's interpretation of this treaty?

8
9

MR. COLLIER:

Now, do we owe any deference to

I think it has been recognized

many times by this Court that the interpretation of an

10

international treaty by the executive branch is due

11

deference.

12

My only point, Justice O'Connor,

is simply that

13

they have expressed one interpretation in 1978 and the

14

other at this time, and I would point out that this Court

15

ruled in Nielsen v. Johnson that where a treaty fairly

16

admits two interpretations, the one restricting and the

17

other enlarging rights provided for in that treaty,

18

the liberal interpretation is to be preferred.

19

certainly the United States cannot disagree that the

20

interpretation placed on this treaty by eight of the

21

original 12 drafters and in harmony with its

22

interpretation in 1978 is unreasonable.

23

QUESTION:

then

And

Mr. Collier, let me try to put my

24

earlier question more precisely.

25

these containers would not be a tax chargeable by reason

What kind of a tax upon

of importation?
I mean, I am pressed with the fact that these

2

3

treaties do not say containers may not be taxed.

4

doesn't say that.

5

upon them any taxes chargeable by reason of importation.

6

Now, why that narrowing?

7

only those taxes chargeable by reason of importation?

9

It says that there may not be imposed

MR. COLLIER:

8

It

What has been excluded by saying

The 1972 treaty clarified that

issue when it provided a limited exception to the type of

10

taxes that could be imposed on containers, and that

11

exception is set forth in article 1(a) of the container

12

treaty of 1972 where the treaty excluded fees and charges

13

limited in amount to the approximate cost of services

14

rendered.
Now, I might point out that an exception which

15
16

is provided to a prohibition of taxes in a treaty need not

17

have been provided unless that was prohibited by the

18

general prohibition in the first place.

exception.

to a container, it may then tax or charge a fee on the

containers in that setting.

MR. COLLIER:

They do not.

QUESTION:

But are they not in Tennessee at the

MR. COLLIER:

It is true that the containers are

present and have been imported into Tennessee at the time

of the tax.

Could you then put a sales tax on it?

Tennessee and then they're leased, and then you tax the

14

MR. COLLIER:

In the event that they were

warehoused in Tennessee, as long as they were continuously

be exempted under the tax treaty prohibition.

Well, let me just be -- say I'm

talking about a new container now, to keep it simple.

QUESTION:

Now, what's the difference between

MR. COLLIER:

The sale is the container as an

international traffic.

In any event, putting aside for a moment the

QUESTION:

First,

I simply don't know the answer to

that.
In the situation in our case,

the United States

14

reasoned that McGoldrick did apply to containers under the

15

treaty and under the Federal regulation, and indeed,

16

United States in Japan Line pointed out to this Court that

17

not only the treaties, but the implementing Federal

18

regulation created a circumstance where the containers

were simply not present for purposes of State taxation,

and that the tax on containers should be invalidated under

the reasoning of McGoldrick.

conventions were to aid the American export drive by

reducing the cost of carrying American goods by container

to foreign markets.

adoption of the 1972 treaty, pointed out that the purpose

I think the same deference is

the containers at issue here were in Tennessee for less

MR. COLLIER:

5

I believe that the record

indicates that, though I would also point out to this

7

Court that the Federal Customs Bureau has waived that

8

particular requirement and no longer requires 3 months as

a matter of regulation.

That's what the treaty sets

forth, but the U.S. Customs regulations allow the

containers to remain for a longer period of time.

3

What Congress sought through the waiver of

MR. COLLIER:

The sales tax in this case was

the lease, and since these containers were charged on

It's, thus, beyond the scope

Two, the tax as applied isn't at variance with

MR. BURSON:

QUESTION:

It's your contention that

Yes.
Because the VAT tax is upon the

contents of the containers, but the value of those

6

contents is increased for purposes of the VAT by the

effect, the lease is being taxed through the VAT anyway.

QUESTION:

So that you don't reach -- you don't

10

MR. BURSON:

11

QUESTION:

No.
But you tax based on the delivery,

12

not the execution of the lease.

13

MR. BURSON:

That's correct.

Tennessee's whole

14

sales tax scheme -- in fact, in most jurisdictions in this

15

country, the sales tax is based upon delivery.

16

And let make a point.

These containers come

17

into Tennessee and then they are competing for transport

18

business within Tennessee with other commercial activity

19

in that State, and it's this commercial activity that

20

Tennessee is taxing, not the mere presence or even the

21

mere transit through the State of these container leases.

22

Quite frankly, it's much less of a tax, say, on

23

importation than is the VAT tax, which is - - really taxes

the goods because they're imported and gets, within the

25

economic measure of that tax, the cost of the lease.

The United States agrees with Tennessee that

that are implicated in a case such as this.
First, it would serve the important national

3

interest, the interest of the Nation as a whole, of

4

protecting the rights of the individual sovereign States

5

to impose taxes on matters within their borders, and

6

thereby to ensure that those engaged in foreign commerce,

7

no less than those engaged in interstate and domestic

8

commerce, bear their fair share of the burden of

9

supporting State and local governments.

10

Secondly, in the view of the United States, a

11

holding by this Court to that effect would be consistent

12

with the United States' interests in international

13

relations and in foreign commerce.

14

Our position rests on two principal points.

15

First, the conventions on containers, the implementing

16

statutes and regulations, as construed by the executive

17

branch, do not bar generally applicable sales taxes of

18

this nature.

19

international taxation that has been accepted and

recognized by the United States that bars taxes.

7

statutory point before I move on to the conventions.

The

8

statute at issue is quoted at page 10 of our brief, and it

9

reads - - it provides that instruments of international

10

traffic, which includes containers, are exempt from the

11

application of the customs laws to such extent and subject

12

to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed in

13

regulations or instructions of the Secretary.

itself contains no exemption even from the customs laws.

You're referred to the regulations of the Secretary to

determine what exemptions there are.

the Secretary in this case exempt containers from the

customs laws and duties, both the entry and the duties

QUESTION:

There is a uniform practice

And I would like to make

this for an example.
If a British steamship line leases a container

which is delivered in Tennessee to export a case or cases

13

of Jack Daniels whiskey to London, certainly the taxes

14

imposed on the container lessee by Tennessee has to be by

15

16

that the United States has raised in Britain only means

17

that when a customer at a pub purchases a fifth of Jack

18

Daniels, he has to pay an import VAT on the base price as

It doesn't affect the use of containers.

QUESTION:

There is a sales tax technically, but

the question is you say it is in effect, and so is the VAT
