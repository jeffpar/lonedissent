Fretwell.

General Bryant.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WINSTON BRYANT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRYANT:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The petitioner believes the general issue in

10
11

this case to be whether counsel for Mr. Fretwell was

12

ineffective under the Sixth Amendment when he failed to

13

raise a double-counting issue that may have benefited him

14

at the time of the trial but which has subsequently been

15

shown by a decision of this Court to be without merit.

16

I would like to recite a few of the facts in

17

this case, because their order is important.

18

1985, Fretwell lied in wait, entered the home of the

19

victim, stole his money at gunpoint, and shot the victim

20

in the head and killed him.

21

fled in the victim's pickup truck.

In April of

Fretwell and two companions

Fretwell was tried in August of 1985, and the

22

23

jury convicted him of capital felony murder.

24

bifurcated into a guilt-innocence phase and a penalty

25

phase.

The case was

After conviction, the court instructed the jury on

1

two aggravating circumstances:

2

the purpose of avoiding or preventing an arrest, and 2)

3

murder committed for pecuniary gain.

4

1)

murder committed for

The jury found only murder for pecuniary gain as

5

an aggravating circumstance, and found no mitigating

6

circumstances.

7

Fretwell's counsel failed to object to the

8

submission of pecuniary gain to the jury despite the fact

9

that the Eighth Circuit had handed down Collins v.

10
11

Lockhart in January of the same year, in 1985.
Collins held that the Eighth and Fourteenth

12

Amendments prohibit the use of pecuniary gain as an

13

aggravating circumstance in capital felony murder trials

14

where murder - - where robbery-murder is the capital

15

offense at issue.

16

Fretwell then appealed his conviction to the

17

Arkansas Supreme Court.

18

raised, but the court, the supreme court, decided --

19

declined to decide the issue because it had not been

20

raised at the trial level.

21
22

23

The issue of double counting was

Then in April of '87 the Arkansas Supreme Court
denied Fretwell's application for post-judgment relief.
Then in May of that year, 1987, he filed a

24

habeas petition in Federal district court claiming

25

ineffective assistance of counsel.

1

Now, in January of 1 88, shortly after he filed

2

his habeas petition, this Court handed down Lowenfield v.

3

Phelps.

4

violate the Eighth Amendment simply because an aggravating

5

circumstance found by the jury duplicated an element of

6

the underlying criminal offense.

Lowenfield held that a death sentence does not

7
8

To pass constitutional muster, a capital
sentencing scheme must genuinely narrow the class of
persons eligible for the death penalty.
QUESTION:

10

General Bryant, the question you

11

present in your petition for certiorari seems to me to

12

assume that the Collins case was properly overruled by the

13

Eighth Circuit on the basis of Lowenfield.

14

that we have here any issue as to whether that overruling

15

was correct or not.

16

MR. BRYANT:

I don't see

That is correct, Chief Justice

17

Rehnquist.

18

actually, the Lowenfield case prior to the Perry case --

1

but the issue before this Court in the opinion of the

20

State is whether or not the ineffective assistance of

21

counsel claim under the Sixth Amendment has been met, and

22

the State's position is that when Lowenfield was decided

23

it was based on a decision by this Court in Jurek v.

24

Texas, decided in 1 76, and therefore was not new law that

25

applied to the Fretwell situation.

It was overruled by the Perry case -- well,

1

After Lowenfield was decided, the Eighth Circuit

2

in the Perry case, Perry v. Lockhart, which overruled

3

Collins, specifically considered the death sentencing

4

scheme in Arkansas and said that it was not

5

indistinguishable from that in the Lowenfield decision,

6

which talked about the death penalty sentencing scheme in

7

the State of Louisiana.

8

9

But after that, the Federal district court in
Little Rock issued a decision and rejected all claims that

10

Fretwell had made in his habeas petition, except to the

11

extent that the court found that the was ineffective

12

assistance of counsel because the pecuniary gain as an

13

aggravating circumstance had not been objected to at the

14

trial court level, and then the district court directed

15

that Mr. Fretwell either be resentenced or his conviction

16

reduced to life without parole.

17

And then in September of 1991 the Eighth Circuit

18

affirmed the district court's decision with one exception.

19

They directed that Mr. Fretwell's sentence be reduced to

20

life without parole.

21

QUESTION:

So -Well, just to follow up on the

22

question by the Chief Justice, is it open to the

23

respondent to argue that the Eighth Circuit case, Collins,

24

improperly -- was improperly overruled, that it was right

25

all the time?

2

MR. BRYANT:

It's our position that that issue

is before this Court and --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. BRYANT:

That it is before the Court.
The issue is before the Court, the

5

Collins decision, simply because that was the basis for

6

Fretwell's claim.

7

It's the position of the State that Collins was

8

bad law at the time, and even if you do not accept that

9

theory, under the Lowenfield decision it was overruled and

10

under our concept, the prejudice prong of the Strickland

11

test, the reviewing court must consider whether or not the

12

prejudice occurred at the time of the reviewing -- the

13

reviewing court makes its decision, and not at the time

14

the alleged errors of counsel were made.

15

QUESTION:

Do you think that position is

16

entirely consistent with Teague, that you generally look

17

at the law at the time of trial, the legal rules?

18

MR. BRYANT:

It's our position that if you look

19

at the performance prong of the Strickland test that you

20

look at the alleged errors at the time they were made.

21

If you look at the prejudice prong of the

22

Strickland test, it's our position that the reviewing

23

court should look at it at the time the review is made.

24
25

QUESTION:

Would it be the same -- would you

give the same view if instead of being an overruling there

1

had been a statutory change, say that an objection might

2

have been proper at the time of trial and then by the time

3

it gets to review and habeas corpus the legislature

4

changes some rule and you no longer could make that

5

obj ection?

6

Would the ineffective assistance of counsel in

7

failing to make the objection also be judged, in your

8

view, by the time after the legislation?

9

MR. BRYANT:

Quite frankly, I have not

10

considered that question, but I think that there would

11

be - - you could argue more forcefully for the ineffective

12

assistance of counsel claim in that instance, because the

13

legislative act would occur after the fact.

14
15

QUESTION:

the defendant shouldn't have a windfall, isn't it?

16

MR. BRYANT:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Well, your position is basically that

That is correct.

That is correct.

A ruling that he would not ultimately

have been entitled to.
MR. BRYANT:

And if -- that is the reason why

20

that we think the Eighth Circuit should be overruled,

21

because the Eighth Circuit's decision really stops -- when

22

they consider the prejudice prong of the Strickland test,

23

they stop at the time the alleged counsel's errors were

24

made, and we think that is incorrect.

25

prejudice prong should be considered at the time of the

We think the

1

reviewing court decision.
In addition to that, the Eighth Circuit Court

2

3

used as a basis for its decision the supremacy clause.

4

this particular case, the Eighth Circuit in the Fretwell

5

decision held that the trial court should have followed

6

Collins because Collins had been decided by the Eighth

7

Circuit in January before the trial occurred in August.

8

Using the supremacy clause as a basis, the Eighth Circuit

9

directed that the Arkansas Court should have followed

10
11

In

Collins.
It's our position that the supremacy clause does

12

not apply in this case, and in fact the great weight of

13

authority is that the State courts are not bound to follow

14

decisions of the lower Federal courts.

15

parts of the judicial system, and so the Arkansas court

16

was not bound to follow Collins.

17

They're co-equal

And in fact, had the issue come up and the

18

attorney for Fretwell had made an objection to the use of

19

pecuniary gain as an aggravating circumstance, we think

20

that the better rule for the court to have followed -- the

21

court would have been bound to have followed the Jurek v.

22

Texas decision which was already on the books, and so for

23

that reason we think that the decision by the Eighth

24

Circuit is, quite frankly, incorrect in its applications.

25

QUESTION:

Then it's just as though prior to

1

Collins the Arkansas Supreme Court had said double

2

counting is all right and refused to change its rule in

3

the light of Collins.

4

MR. BRYANT:

5

QUESTION:

Justice White, the -You say that Arkansas, until it's

6

overruled by this Court, can have its own view of the

7

Constitution.

8

9

MR. BRYANT:

As compared to a decision by the

Eighth Circuit.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BRYANT:

Yes.
But the Jurek v. Texas decision had

12

been decided by this Court in '76, and quite frankly, the

13

Arkansas trial court in our opinion would have been bound

14

to follow Jurek v. Texas --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BRYANT:

Mm-hmm.
Because Collins was bad law at the

17

time, and I think that was pointed out by the dissent in

18

the Fretwell case, and of course Perry specifically

19

overruled the Collins decision after the fact.

20

QUESTION:

Well, you know, we aren't interested

21

just in deciding the facts of this -- you know, whether

22

this case should be reversed or affirmed.

23

interested in getting at the question of whether assuming

24

that Collins was an Eighth Circuit decision that stood for

25

a while and then was later overruled in Perry, you know,

I think we're

what should be the effect of that on the Respondent's

habeas corpus rights - -

MR. BRYANT:

QUESTION:

5

MR. .BRYANT:

We - Or assistance of counsel rights?
Chief Justice Rehnquist, we feel

6

that the habeas claim is not meritorious and it should be

7

decided against Mr. Fretwell, simply because he is not

8

alleging any constitutional right that has been violated

9

against him.
The aggravating circumstance that was submitted

10

to the jury --

QUESTION:

13

MR. BRYANT:

14

QUESTION:

Well, but may I --- was bad law at the time.
But -- could I interrupt you?

The

15

constitutional violation of these claims is ineffective

16

assistance of counsel, isn't that right?

17

MR. BRYANT:

18

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And I thought it was agreed by

19

everyone that counsel was in fact ineffective, but your

20

claim is that there was no prejudice from the

21

ineffective -MR. BRYANT:

22

23

The prejudice prong has not been

met.
QUESTION:

Right, but you do agree that it was

ineffective to fail to make an objection that was

1

indicated by a recently decided case.
MR. BRYANT:

2

3

Yes, and we did not challenge that

at the Eighth Circuit, nor have we challenged it - QUESTION:

4

And then on the prejudice point, if

5

one assumes that even though the trial judge might have

6

had the power to not follow it, but if one assumes as a

7

matter of probabilities that the trial judge would have

8

sustained the objection because there's a recent Eighth

9

Circuit case out there that was directly on point, that

10

that would have meant he would have not gotten the death

11

penalty.
MR. BRYANT:

12

QUESTION:

3
4

That is correct.
And that's not -- you don't think

that's sufficient to show prejudice.
MR. BRYANT:

5

Well, the real issue in this

6

particular case is the definition and the parameters on

7

the prejudice prong in the Strickland case.

8

Circuit --

9
20
21

QUESTION:

The Eighth

And you don't think the difference

between life and death is prejudice.
MR. BRYANT:

Well, I think the issue is really

22

whether or not the defendant was prejudiced because he's

23

raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and

24

what the Eighth Circuit has done is focus its inquiry on

25

whether or not there would have been a reasonable

1
2

probability that the result would have been different.
And it's our position that the Strickland, Nix,

3

and Kimmelman cases all require a - - in analyzing that

4

aspect of the prejudice prong do not only look at whether

5

or not the result may have been different, but look at

6

whether the counsel's errors were so serious as to impair

7

the adversarial process to where the defendant would not

8

receive a fair trial and a just result, and that is the

9

real focus of this inquiry, and when that is the test,

10

Fretwell does not meet the - - or does not meet

11

constitutional muster on proving his ineffective

12

assistance of counsel claim.

13
14
15

With that, the petitioner will reserve time,
Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, could I just ask you, why do

16

you -- I don't quite understand why you concede that it

17

was ineffective assistance of counsel because the Arkansas

18

law wasn't necessarily what the -- the Arkansas view of

19

the Constitution was not necessarily the same as, or

20

controlled by what the Court of Appeals for the Eighth

21

Circuit said.

22

MR. BRYANT:

Maybe I misspoke to a certain

23

extent when I said we completely agreed that counsel was

24

ineffective.

25

that, and we did not challenge that before the Eighth

We have taken a position of not challenging

Circuit, and we haven't challenged -QUESTION:

2

So as the case comes to us, you're

3

willing to have it judged on the ground that the counsel

4

was ineffective when he failed to object.

5

MR. BRYANT:

6

QUESTION:

7

Is that right?

It's either one way

or another.
MR. BRYANT:

8

9

Well --

Yes, that is correct, but to

explain, the issue that we're raising in this case is the

10

prejudice prong and according to the Kimmelman case that

11

can be considered first before the performance prong of

12

the Strickland test.

14

I would like to reserve the remainder of my
time --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY L. WAX

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

20

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER

21

MS. WAX:

Before I begin, Mr. Chief Justice and

22

may it please the Court, I would like to just address the

23

question of whether it's open to respondent to argue that

24

Lowenfield does not apply to the Arkansas death penalty

25

statute and that Lowenfield didn't overrule Collins.

We do not believe that it is

1

that the Court

2

should consider that issue as a possible ground for

3

affirmance because the premise of the question presented

4

in the petition was that Lowenfield did overrule Collins

5

and respondent did not dispute that in his opposition to

the petition.

QUESTION:

11

Suppose we think that Collins was correct.
MS. WAX:
QUESTION:

10

I just want to be clear on your

Yes.
What should -- is it open to us to

say that?
MS. WAX:

12

Well, I think the Court in its

13

discretion could, based on this Court's recent

14

pronouncements on whether it should delve into the merits

15

of a predicate that is not questioned by respondent in its

16

opposition.

17

For example, in Eastman Kodak v. Technical

18

Imaging just last term, we think that it would not comport

19

with this Court's recent practice to do that.

20

understand the Court as being absolutely barred from doing

21

it.

22

that it would not be the proper course in this case.

MS. WAX:

2

QUESTION:

3

I think so, Your Honor.
Would that make a difference to you

as far as waiving this argument?

4

MS. WAX:

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. WAX:

Yes, he did have counsel, Your Honor.
Yes.

Yes.

The Government's view in this case is

7

that respondent's counsel was not ineffective and he is

8

not entitled to habeas relief because his counsel failed

9

to make an objection to his sentencing that this Court's

10

subsequent cases show to be without merit.
There are two reasons for this.

11

First,

12

respondent's counsel was not ineffective because

13

respondent suffered no legally cognizable prejudice from

14

his counsel's conduct of the penalty phase of his trial.

15

That is because the procedures employed at the penalty

16

phase of his trial were perfectly valid under the Eighth

17

Amendment.

18

Thus - QUESTION:

Well, doesn't that -- if you divide

19

the issue into whether counsel was ineffective and whether

20

there was prejudice under Strickland, that -- what you're

21

talking really goes to the prejudice part, doesn't it?

22

MS. WAX:

23

counsel's conduct deficient?

MS. WAX:

2

QUESTION:

3

Right.
So you're willing to agree that

counsel's performance was deficient, as you put it?

4

MS. WAX:

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. WAX:

We did not argue that his counsel -Okay.
That his conduct was not deficient

7

because the State did not press that issue below, although

8

we think it's debatable, and we also would disagree with

view is that counsel's conduct did not deprive respondent

convicted because of the ineffectiveness of counsel.

2

MS. WAX:

3

QUESTION:

That's right.

That's implicit --

And you're saying that it was not the

4

ineffectiveness of counsel that was the cause of the

5

conviction here, but the law.
MS. WAX:

6

You don't have a simple right not to

7

have your counsel make an error, not to have your counsel

8

fall below a professional level of competence.

9

have a right, you know, to that.

You don't

You have a right to a

10

fair sentencing or trial, or one whose outcome is

11

reliable, and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is

12

designed to advance, procure, obtain that result, correct.
The second reason that respondent's claim fails

13
14

is that the habeas corpus statute itself, 28 U.S.C.

15

2254(a), provides that a person is entitled to habeas

16

relief only if he shows that he is in custody in violation

17

of the Constitution or of the laws of the United States.

18

Respondent could not make that showing, because as of the

19

time that the court granted habeas relief, there was no

20

constitutional defect in the procedures used to sentence

21

him.

22

Now, with regard to respondent's Sixth Amendment

23

claim, he claims that he should receive relief because his

24

attorney failed to make an objection based on the Eighth

25

Circuit's ruling in Collins v. Lockhart which bars the

1

submission of a redundant aggravating circumstance at the

2

penalty phase of a trial for a capital offense.

3

Now, under a straightforward reading of

4

Strickland, respondent could not possibly have an

5

ineffective assistance claim.

6

Strickland, it is necessary first to demonstrate that

7

there was a reasonable possibility that the outcome of the

8

case might have been different, but that's not enough.

9

You also have to show that counsel's error was so serious

10

that it deprived the person of a fair trial or a reliable

11

outcome.

12

To so prejudice under

Now, under Lowenfield v. Phelps, there was

13

nothing wrong with what happened at the penalty phase of

14

respondent's trial and therefore he cannot meet that

15

condition so he is not entitled to habeas relief.

16

The second argument that - -

17

QUESTION:

So we could assume that the attorney,

18

say, could be sued in a professional negligence action

19

because - - if we assume the outcome would have been

20

different, and that he did not know about the Collins case

21

and he should have known about the Collins case, but

22

there's still no constitutional violation because the

23

trial was fair.

MS. WAX:

sue for professional negligence even though it's a fair

2

trial, but I understand the difference.
MS. WAX:

3

Well, that's because there's only one

4

Constitution and either Collins was right or it wasn't

5

right, and a basic tenet of our constitutional

6

jurisprudence is that we apply the present view of the

7

law.

controls whether or not an individual has been deprived of

The present view of the law is presumed to be the

QUESTION:

Well, you say that he's not entitled

to relief because the trial was fair.

13

MS. WAX:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.
That suggests that perhaps there

15

might have been a constitutional violation, but

16

nonetheless it was fair.

17

it, that your position is he's not entitled to relief

18

because no constitutional violation -- there was no

19

constitutional violation which occurred at his trial.

20

MS. WAX:

It's accurate to say here, isn't

Well, his contention is that his trial

21

is unfair because there as a constitutional -- he's saying

22

that there was an Eighth Amendment defect in his trial

23

because Collins addresses the Eighth Amendment viability

24

of the proceeding.

That's why the case is here.

MS. WAX:

1

Exactly.

So we are saying that there

was no constitutional defect.

happens to be predicated on the further claim that there

was constitutional prejudice.

Now, the second independent --

QUESTION:

So I'm still not sure what the

standard is, whether or not counsel committed a

constitutional error - MS. WAX:

No, the standard is broader than that,

because it encompasses -- you're saying for a Sixth

12

Amendment violation - -

QUESTION:

MS. WAX:

What's the standard?

is -- for prejudice is really a two-part standard.

is there a

That's just the first part.
The second part is, would that error, the

20

different outcome -- is it one that detracts from the

21

fairness of the trial or from the reliability of the

22

outcome, or deprives the individual of a right that goes

23

to the reliability of the outcome or the fairness of the

24

trial?

1

the Eighth Amendment violation, that would make the result

2

less reliable, because it means that the jury would have

3

imposed the death penalty in a manner that does not

4

comport with the Eighth Amendment, and that's precisely

5

what we're saying didn't happen here.
Everything that happened at the penalty phase

comported with the Eighth Amendment as this Court stated

the requirements of the Eighth Amendment under Lowenfield

v. Phelps.

10

Now, the district --

11

QUESTION:

Supposing Lowenfield had never been

12

decided, would it have been open to the State to argue on

13

habeas that the Collins case was wrong and therefore there

14

was no prejudice?

15

MS. WAX:

I think that it might have been --

16

yes, it might have been open to them to do that, because

17

they could have sought in effect the Lowenfield ruling.

20

QUESTION:

And even though the trial judge would

have -- well, okay, I understand.
MS. WAX:

I mean, the court could have rejected

21

the habeas claim on the basis of the Lowenfield insight,

so to speak.

23

Now, the district court was also wrong to grant

the habeas relief for the independent reason that the

habeas statute itself does not authorize that relief.

2

were wrong, or it was not publicly announced that they

3

were wrong until 4 years later.

4

saying the law changed.

5

MR. MEDLOCK:

That's different from

The law did change, Justice

6

Scalia, in that the rule regarding pecuniary gain was

7

changed, and our point here is that even though we need

8

not reach the question of whether the subsequent law has

9

anything to do with it, this Strickland analysis, it does

10

in a sense that there is before us the possibility of

11

deciding whether or not Lowenfield applies to Arkansas.

12

Our position is no, Lowenfield does not apply to

13

Arkansas, therefore, the change which occurred was wrong.

14

The law of Collins was always good, and is.

15

QUESTION:

Is it open to us to consider that

16

Collins was wrong for this reason, that it would be

17

possible under the Arkansas statute to commit burglary

18

without doing so for pecuniary gain, and that therefore

19

the - - kind of the basic assumption of Collins was wrong

20

in the first place?

21

Is that analysis open to us?

MR. MEDLOCK:

No, sir.

If I understand the

22

question, that pecuniary gain within the context of a

burglary statute is not the same thing that we are

24

considering in our capital punishment statute.

pecuniary gain was necessarily the motive for burglary and

2

therefore the commission of a crime for pecuniary gain did

not narrow the class of burglars.

MR. MEDLOCK:

QUESTION:

Pecuniary gain is a

I should have said robbery.
Yes, oh, okay.

Is it -- so that you're saying it

10

would not be possible for us to analyze the State law to

11

find that there was a class of robbery in which pecuniary

12

gain was not the motive?

13

this may be a misstatement of State law, but what if

14

someone had committed or had attempted to commit theft,

15

and on learning that he was about to be discovered fled

16

and used force in fleeing?

law is written, the robbery would have occurred at the

point at which he used force to escape, and his motive at

that point was not pecuniary gain but to escape.

prongs and that you therefore would consider it in that

light, that -- it -- once again, what mainly stands out to

me from Strickland is a concept of fairness.

5

The fundamental fairness, a fair assessment of

any Sixth Amendment claim, requires us to look at what

7

happened at the time of the trial, that things changed

later, that the law developed over time through the

be held to relate back and somehow remove the taint of

It's difficult to conceive of a broader class.

Any narrowing which occurs in Arkansas occurs in

the penalty phase.

that evidences the Arkansas legislature's intent that

narrowing occur here and as said earlier there are Supreme

7

Court interpretations of the statute that support the view

8

as well.

9

If you look at the statutory language,

The legislature made clear that the penalty

10

phase is all-important in Arkansas, not superfluous as it

11

would be under a Lowenfield Class 1 characterization, by

12

setting forth three separate findings which must be made

13

within the penalty phase.

14

A person first of all, in order to be convicted,

15

must be found to have committed a crime with aggravating

16

circumstances, at least one or more of the specified

17

aggravating circumstances.

18

Second, the jury has to weigh these against any

find that they outweigh the mitigation, and thirdly the

capital punishment statute doesn't adequately narrow those

2

people --to those people eligible for the death penalty,

3

you would say, then, that the whole statute is invalid as

4

a death penalty statute.

5

MR. MEDLOCK:

No, sir.

I think it's fine if

6

it's applied correctly.

I think that the legislature

7

created a situation as just stated, that if the narrowing

8

function occurs at the guilt phase, as it does regularly,

9

then the statute is okay.

As long as the Eighth Amendment

10

standards have been met as far as narrowing the class of

11

death-eligible persons, then the statute's fine, and the

12

statute provides a mechanism for that at the penalty

13

phase.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well then, what do you say is wrong

with the statute?
MR. MEDLOCK:

It's not that there's something

wrong with it, it's that it does not fit into that first

18

group of statutes under Lowenfield which narrowly define

19

offenders at the -- within the definition of the offense.

20

It's obvious that the legislature did not deem

21

the sentencing phase superfluous in Arkansas.

Black, the difference between a weighing State and a

nonweighing State is not one of semantics but of critical

3

importance.

gives emphasis to the requirement that aggravating

5

circumstances be defined with precision, and when one

duplicates an element of the underlying offense, it simply

is illusory and does not have sufficient precision.

9

The fact that Arkansas is a weighing State

Stringer states that a vague aggravating
circumstance fails to channel the sentencer's discretion,

and when used in the weighing process is in a sense worse,

for it creates the risk that the jury will treat the

defendant as more deserving of the death penalty than he

might otherwise be.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WINSTON BRYANT

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. BRYANT:

Regarding a point that has been

7

raised, the Arkansas Supreme Court has considered the

8

Lowenfield decision.

9

Fretwell case on appeal to the supreme court.

As I stated, it was raised in the
The supreme

10

court did not decide the issue because it was not raised

11

at the trial level.

12

Later, in 1988, in the case of O'Rourke v.

13

State, the appellant, relying on Collins, asserted that he

14

was denied due process and the Arkansas court in

15

responding to that claim basically said that, as was the

16

case with Louisiana's death penalty law which was

17

considered in Lowenfield, the duplicative nature of

18

Arkansas' statutory aggravating circumstances did not

19

render appellant's sentencing infirm and the Constitution

20

requires no more.

21

So the Arkansas court has considered the

22

Lowenfield issue, the double-counting issue, and in

23

addition to that the Eighth Circuit in Perry also approved

24

the Arkansas capital sentencing scheme.

25

Lowenfield comparing the Arkansas statute with Louisiana

In view of

1

statute as well as the Texas statute under Jurek, Arkansas

2

does narrow those eligible for the death penalty at the

3

guilt phase of the trial.

4

Reference has been made to Stringer v. Black.

5

That case is not applicable to our situation because

6

Stringer v. Black involved an aggravating circumstance

7

that was too broad and was not specific enough, and this

8

Court said so.

9

an aggravating circumstance that is too broad.

We do not have a problem in Fretwell with

10

contrary.

made that pecuniary gain is too broad.

Quite the

I don't think there's ever been any allegation
It is specific.

One other point that I would make is that, as

12

14

not a necessary element of the criminal offense of

15

robbery.
QUESTION:

16
17
18

Has the Arkansas Supreme Court ever

so held?
MR. BRYANT:

Yes, that has been held by the

19

Arkansas Supreme Court in a number of decisions, which is

20

pointed out in our reply brief, and so because of that,

21

because it's only a motive, it's not necessary that

22

pecuniary gain be proven, so in that regard it is not a

23

duplicate element of the initial offense.

24
25

However, in the State's view that is not
relevant anyway, because we do sufficiently narrow at the
