ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FRIED:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This is a case of implied preemption.

The court

14

of appeals held that a public owner developing its

15

property may not support a agreement between its

16

construction manager and a council of local unions, an

17

agreement of the sort specifically authorized by sections

18

8(e) and 8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act.

19

The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, one

20

of the petitioners here, is under Federal court order to

21

complete a massive and complicated construction project.

22

The Authority, as any public or private owner with a

23

similar task, has engaged the services of a construction

24

industry specialist, here Kaiser Engineering, another of

25

the petitioners, to schedule and plan the tasks to be

1

performed, to supervise the contractors performing those

2

tasks, and to establish a labor relations regime for the

3

proj ect.

4

Accordingly, Kaiser did propose to the Authority

5

that the labor relations regime here should be one which

6

is quite common on such projects, a project labor

7

agreement, which is an agreement with all of the unions

8

that usually supply crafts to such a project in return for

9

exclusive representational rights for all workers on the

10

projects irrespective of their contracting and

11

subcontracting relations.

12

the owner of the project get the benefit of stable costs,

13

stable labor costs throughout the life of the project, and

14

security against the kinds of labor disruptions that are

15

caused by lawful labor activity.

The contractors and eventually

Kaiser proposed such an arrangement to the

16
17

Authority, which approved the proposal, and accordingly

18

Kaiser negotiated and signed the agreement with the unions

19

here.

QUESTION:

At that point I suppose the Authority

was bound by the contract?
MR. FRIED:

The Authority was not a signatory to

the contract.

I know, but they, I suppose

Kaiser was its agent.

MR. FRIED:

1

Well, a great point is made of that.

2

Nowhere is that said.

On some copies of the cover of the

3

agreement, and that is reprinted in one of the appendices,

4

it said that this was done on behalf of the Authority, and

5

that of course is quite true.

6

ultimate party that stands to benefit from this.

7

it is nowhere stated that Kaiser is an agent, nor is

8

Kaiser, I'm sorry, that the Authority is an agent, nor is

9

the Authority a signatory.

The Authority is the
However,

In these connections of course these contracts

10
11

are read in such a way as to assure their validity, and

12

Kaiser is a sophisticated and a frequent player in this

13

particular arena and of course it had every intention to

14

be bound.

15

would have been bound by virtue of the contract itself, by

16

virtue of that project labor agreement itself.

17

quite clear that Kaiser is bound, it is quite clear that

18

Kaiser is a signatory.

19

It is not at all clear whether the Authority

QUESTION:

It is

Well, why wouldn't it be bound?

Why

20

wouldn't the Authority be bound if they approved in

21

advance the negotiation of this contract and Kaiser had

22

been hired as its, for the purpose of managing labor

23

relations, among other things?

24

MR. FRIED:

25

Well, perhaps it would have been

bound, and if it would be bound it might be subject to

1

suit under section 301 to enforce that contract, but that

2

would not in any way affect its validity.

3

Now, in order to make the arrangement an

4

effective one because of Massachusetts' competitive

5

bidding laws the Authority included adherence to the

6

arrangement as a bid specification.

7

Relations Board in another proceeding, the district court

8

in this proceeding, as well as the panel of the court of

9

appeals and the court of appeals en banc all agreed that

10

this was a valid labor agreement under sections 8(e) and

11

8(f).

12

specific action of the Authority in including adherence to

13

the arrangement as a bid specification improperly

14

intervened in labor relations, and therefore that that

15

action was preempted.

16

The National Labor

The court of appeals found, however, that the

QUESTION:

Well, does that turn, that decision

17

turn on whether the Authority was acting as a proprietor

18

or as a regulator?

19

MR. FRIED:

In our view it ought to turn on it.

20

In the view of the court of appeals it does not, and we

21

think that that is a serious mistake.

22

implied preemption in general gives a court of, gives a

23

court the authority to intervene in and to invalidate the

24

action of the state only if what the state has done in

25

some way contradicts a policy of Federal legislation.

The doctrine of

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

But

1

the policy of Federal legislation here is to leave the

2

choice of a project labor agreement open as an option, so

3

that what the Authority did here was not in any way to

4

contradict that policy but in fact to utilize it.

5

Now, under the Machinists doctrine, which is the

6

specific head of labor preemption on which the court of

7

appeals relied, the rule often repeated by this Court is

8

that a state may not seek to regulate that which the labor

9

laws indicate must remain free for the play of labor

10

market forces.

But if a state is not to supply all of its

11

needs directly, if it is to enter the market as a

12

purchaser, then it is inevitable that some line, such as

3

the line between the state as a participant in the market

4

and the state as a regulator, be drawn.

QUESTION:

virtue of its use of its spending power?

Can the state be a regulator just by

MR. FRIED:

This Court so held in the Gould

case.
QUESTION:
MR. FRIED:

Right.
And the test is a test which I will

21

draw from what this Court said in the New York Telephone

22

case, what is the scope, purport, and impact of what the

23

state has done.

24

power is not a sufficient condition to get it out from

25

under labor preemption, of course not.

Simply the fact that it uses its spending

1

But in this case the scope, purport, and impact

2

of what the state did was precisely tailored to its needs

3

as a proprietor.

4

faced with the same problems would not have done.

5

very striking how narrowly tailored the project labor

6

agreement in this case is to the specific needs of this

7

proj ect.

It did nothing that a private party
It's

8

These agreements often require all contractors

9

coming on the job to be union signatory generally in all

10

their work for the life of the agreement.

11

does not require that.

12

the contractors accept union representation on this job.

13

That is how narrowly tailored the Authority's action is to

14

serve its narrow proprietary interests.

This agreement

This agreement only requires that

15

Another way of putting it - -

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, suppose a state decides

17

that it wants to assure all its contracts a degree of

18

security so it provides that all state contracting must be

19

done with union contractors.
MR. FRIED:

20

Would that be valid?

On an appropriate record with

21

appropriate findings that might be valid, yes, Your Honor.

22

I could not say in a blanket way that under no

23

circumstances would such a, would such a labor policy be

24

invalid.

25

is to show that something that is that comprehensive, that

But there is a great difficulty.

The difficulty

reaches beyond the needs of a particular project

want to say a priori that that showing could never be

4

made.

5

the very narrowness of what the state did.

But that showing need not be made here because of

QUESTION:

6

I would not

Would you look to the, just the face

7

of the law in question or do we have to investigate the

8

intent of the legislators in each case?

9

MR. FRIED:

The motive inquiry is absolutely

10

unnecessary to such a thing.

11

purport of the action on its face, and its impact and its

12

scope as it deals with those conditions revealed in the

3
4

What's necessary is the

record.
The perfect contrast is with the Gould case.

In

5

the Gould case the state was using its spending power, it

6

was talking about how it would make purchases, but it is

7

simply implausible, as this Court said, to connect up what

8

the state did with any proprietary concerns that the state

9

might have had.

And that's the sort of inquiry which

20

should be had, and it's an entirely familiar inquiry for

21

this Court.

22

without getting tangled up into inquiries into subjective

23

motivation.

25

It engages in it in all sorts of contexts

1

foreign government acting as a regulator for the market on

2

one hand or acting as a, in the Court's words, a player in

3

the market.

4

was clearly acting as a player in the market.
QUESTION:

6

Now what we're saying is here the Authority

Mr. Fried, how do you distinguish our

holding in the Golden State case?

7

MR. FRIED:

That is a, that is an easier

8

distinction to make because in the Golden State case the

9

state had no proprietary interests in play at all.

It was

10

not a proprietor of any of the parties involved or any of

11

the interests or any of the properties involved.

12

Golden State case, of which a great deal is made in the

13

court of appeals, seems to us to be really quite

14

irrelevant.

15
16

QUESTION:

So the

If that distinction is the proper

one.

17

MR. FRIED:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. FRIED:

Between the state as a market rate?
Yes.
Well, we believe it is, and we

20

certainly rely on it, and I would draw the Court's

21

attention to the fact that if there is no such distinction

22

then the Machinists doctrine cuts in a most unpredictable

23

and I would think devastating way into the room for

24

maneuver of a state when it is not supplying its own needs

25

but is acting as a purchaser, supplies its needs by

1

purchasing them on the market.

2

distinction is absolutely necessary.

3

So I think some such

There is talk in the court of appeals, rather

4

glancing talk, and in the respondents' brief and in some

5

of their amici brief to another head of preemption, Garmon

6

preemption.

7

situations where a state seeks to either supplement or

8

contradict the exclusive jurisdiction of the board.

9

Needless to say, nothing of that sort is present in this

10

Now, Garmon preemption deals principally with

case.
It is also, obtains as a form of preemption

11

12

where the state seeks to limit rights granted under

13

section 7 of the act, and in paragraph 34 of their

14

complaint the respondents, plaintiffs did claim that the

15

rights of workers to be represented or not to be

16

represented by unions of their choice were in some way

17

interfered with by the state's action.

18

viciously begs the question since those section 7 rights

19

are explicitly qualified by the rights of section 8(e) and

20

8(f).

21

have the full range of section 7 rights.

22

But that argument

If 8(e) and 8(f) apply, the workers simply do not

So I think Garmon preemption is really not in

23

play here, and it's understandable that the court of

24

appeals did not rely on it.

25

QUESTION:

Well, let's just assume that arguably

1

the argument had some content.

2

have a chance to say so?

3

MR. FRIED:

Didn't the labor board

Yes, there was a proceeding brought

4

before the labor board, and that's something that must not

5

be forgotten, that the labor board has held that this is a

6

valid agreement of the act.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. FRIED:

9
10
11
12

13

With respect to this very agreement.
This very agreement.

And the

district court and the court of appeals quite clearly said
yes, we do not quarrel with that assumption.
QUESTION:

So their justification for the Garmon

preemption has already been satisfied?
MR. FRIED:

I would have thought it is taken

14

right off the boards, Justice White.

Now, there is a

15

further suggestion that is made and it's a suggestion that

16

seeks to meet my argument about the hamstringing of the

17

state, and that is that what could be done is the state

18

might simply have hired Kaiser as a general contractor.

19

But that would require that this state and many other

20

states for no reason should repeal their competitive

21

bidding laws so that they did not have to let these

22

contracts directly.

23

If I may I would like to reserve --

24

QUESTION:

25

Mr. Fried, wouldn't they be able to

preserve their competitive bidding laws simply by bidding

1

for the construction managers contract, putting that out

2

to bid?

3

MR. FRIED:

But at that point the formalism that

4

would be evoked would be a formalism without any of the

5

advantages of formality because the question would

6

reappear then in the form may the state either require

7

that the general contractor enter this kind of an

8

agreement, suggest it, when the contractor suggests it

9

approve it, and you would get all those questions all over

10

again.

So it would be a very intrusive intrusion into the

11

way states do their business on one hand, and it wouldn't

12

get you anything on the other.

13

same problems all over again, just at a slightly different

14

stage and a slightly different form.

You'd be left with the

this is something that Congress would have intended the

state to enter into.

benefit of being able to look at the interests that are at

4

stake here and see that Congress has in 8(e) and 8(f)

5

balanced these very same interests and concluded that the

6

interests of the purchaser in achieving labor peace on a

7

construction project throughout the duration of that

8

project are to be given priority over the interests of

9

suppliers who prefer to do business with a non-union work

In this preemption we have the

force.
We don't in any way suggest that those, that the

12

interests of employees and suppliers to work on a non­

13

union basis are not important, they are, but Congress

14

weighed those interests, those interests of doing business

15

in that form against the interests of achieving labor

16

stability, and it included that suppliers, that the

17

supplier's interests had to be subordinated to the

18

preferences of the purchaser.

19

So here in this case we have precisely the

20

analogous situation.

We have the state as the purchaser

21

of construction services having concluded in response to

22

economic forces that it needed a project labor agreement.

23

And there is a factual finding in this case, unlike the

24

line drawing that might occur in some future cases, in

25

this case the district court specifically found that the

purpose of this agreement was to obtain labor stability-

2

due to the fact that the unions have legitimate market

3

power in the Massachusetts area, and that in order to get

labor peace it needed to use this arrangement.

6

There

Could the state adopt the opposite

policy and forbid the use of these union hire, pre-hire

agreements by any of its contractors for these projects?
MS. MAHONEY:

9

Yes, Your Honor, I believe that it

10

could, as long as it is acting reasonably in furtherance

11

of its commercial interest, and that really ought to be

12

the inquiry.
QUESTION:

13

But does that import some sort of

14

reasonable judgment as to economic conditions without

15

reference to its judgment as to labor policy, sound labor

16

policy?

17

MS. MAHONEY:

I think that we wouldn't inquire

18

to see whether there was some view about labor policy,

19

certainly many political actors have views about labor

20

policy, but if the decision is one that can reasonably be

21

described as something that would appear to be in

22

furtherance of their commercial interest, and the policy

23

you describe certainly could be.

24

conclude that that's the type of conduct, the same kind of

25

commercial activity that Congress intended to permit.

Then it would be fair to

And there really is no good reason to

1

2

distinguish between the state and the private purchaser in

3

this situation, because as this Court recognized in Abood

4

the interests in labor stability are no less in the public

sector than they are in the private sector, precisely the

very interests that this Court found in Woelke and Romero

and McNeff.

labor stability in a particular job.

MS. MAHONEY:

The only excuses for that that we

2

have heard are that private employers can do it, that's

irrelevant to the analysis, that there should be a

proprietary distinction as opposed to regulation, this

5

Court unanimously said that was not a pertinent analysis

where there was the type of interference that we have

here, and I should add that this in fact is a regulation.

It's at least a mixture of proprietary action and

regulation.

If one looks at the Massachusetts state law

11

definition of regulation which is cited in the amicus

QUESTION:

Well, suppose they said you're in a

labor dispute and therefore it's beyond contradiction that

you can't provide the service that we want, and we're

4

taking our business elsewhere.

5

MR. BASKIN:

And if they conditioned their

6

finding on our settlement of the labor dispute that would

7

be impermissible, because that is what Golden State held.

8

If they said we have to make, we need transportation

provided or we need the project built, show us that you

10

can provide the service, then that would be permissible.

11

Here they haven't given us that opportunity, and for them

12

to say that -- of course we have no labor dispute at all,

13

but for them to say that we think it's a priori that with

14

a labor dispute you won't be able to finish, that simply

cannot be done because then they are directly interfering

with the bargaining process.

MR. BASKIN:

11

It is conceivable that the state

could make such a reasoned judgment based on hearings and

QUESTION:

Yeah, but generally they wouldn't

allow private employers, generally, to coerce union

the reason why it's important that 8(e) doesn't create a

8(e) and 8(f) say that, certainly it

doesn't say that there is a free zone around collective

MR. BASKIN:

It certainly does not create any

8

new Government power to impose collective bargaining.

9

8(d) and H.K. Porter and Machinists and Golden State, they

10

all say the Government can't coerce collective bargaining.

Does 8(e) create an exception from that?

regulates only in the sense that it creates a voluntary,
