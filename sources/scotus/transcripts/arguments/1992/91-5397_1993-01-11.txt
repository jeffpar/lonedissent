ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. THOMPSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MS. THOMPSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case comes before the Court on a writ of

12

certiorari from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.

13

issue for decision is whether 18 U.S. Code section 3243

14

prohibits the State of Kansas from exercising criminal

15

jurisdiction over an offense defined by the laws of the

16

United States and enumerated in the Major Crimes Act, 18

17

U.S. Code 1153.

18

The

Section 3243 was passed by Congress in 1940, and

19

it conferred jurisdiction on Kansas over intra-Indian

20

offenses to the same extent as its courts had jurisdiction

21

over offenses committed elsewhere within the State in

22

accordance with the laws of the State.

23

added a proviso which states that the courts of the United

24

States shall not be deprived of jurisdiction over offenses

25

defined by the laws of the United States.

However, Congress

The first court to interpret section 3243 was

1

2

the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of

3

Youngbear v. Brewer.

4

court's finding that Iowa's jurisdictional statute, which

5

is virtually identical to the Kansas act, did not grant

6

Iowa concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal courts over

7

offenses defined by the laws of the United States.

This 1977 decision upheld a lower

8

In 1982, the Kansas Supreme Court, following the

9

reasoning and analysis of the Eighth Circuit in Youngbear,

10

held that the Federal courts had exclusive jurisdiction

11

over Federal offenses defined in the Major Crimes Act.
Then in 1986, in the case of State of Kansas v.

12

13

Negonsott, the Kansas Supreme Court reversed itself,

14

holding that the State had concurrent jurisdiction with

15

the Federal courts over major crimes.

16

of the Kansas Supreme Court which ultimately gave rise to

17

this case.

18

It is that decision

The facts of the case are not in dispute.

19

Briefly, Mr. Negonsott was arrested, tried, and convicted

20

by State authorities in State court for the crime of

21

aggravated battery.

22

confines of the Kickapoo reservation, and both Mr.

23

Negonsott and the victim were enrolled members of the

24

Kickapoo Nation in Kansas.

Major Crimes Act most closely parallels the State crime?
MS. THOMPSON:

2

It would be those crimes found in

3

18 U.S. Code section 113 (c) and (f), which is basically

assault with a dangerous weapon.

MS. THOMPSON:

QUESTION:

8

MS. THOMPSON:

9

(c) and (f).
(c) and (f).

Thank you.
Mr. Negonsott challenged his

conviction by filing a writ of habeas corpus in the

10

Federal district court, attacking, of course, the subject

11

matter jurisdiction of the State courts.

12

Circuit upheld the district court's dismissal of the writ

13

of habeas corpus, finding that 18 U.S. Code 3243 granted

14

Kansas concurrent jurisdiction over Federal crimes which

15

are also defined by State law.

16

The Tenth

It is our contention that this decision of the

17

Tenth Circuit violates generally accepted principles of

18

Federal Indian law, and is also contrary to the

19

legislative history of the act.
QUESTION:

21

with the language of section 3243?
MS. THOMPSON:

Are you saying that it's inconsistent

Yes, Your Honor, I'm -- Justice

Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

I don't see why that is.

It seems to

me that just taking that rather brief statute on its face,

1

concurrent jurisdiction in the State and Federal courts is

2

perfectly consistent with everything that language says.

3

MS. THOMPSON:

If you take the language of the

4

proviso, where it says, shall not deprive the courts of

5

the United States, it's our contention that shall not

6

deprive is not language granting concurrent jurisdiction.

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. THOMPSON:

9

Why not?
Because it's mandatory -- shall

not deprive the courts of the United States.
QUESTION:

10

Well, but concurrent jurisdiction, if

11

a court has concurrent jurisdiction, it surely has not

12

been deprived of jurisdiction.

13

MS. THOMPSON:

It has been deprived of exclusive

14

jurisdiction, and as this Court has held for the --at

15

least

16

Crimes Act is exclusive with the Federal district courts.

17

the last 100 years, jurisdiction under the Major

QUESTION:

The proviso doesn't say, shall not

18

deprive the courts of the United States of exclusive

19

jurisdiction, it just says of jurisdiction.

20

MS. THOMPSON:

That's correct, Justice

21

Rehnquist, but again, our contention is that you have to

22

analyze this Kansas statute in conjunction with the Major

23

Crimes Act.

24
25

QUESTION:

Anyway, why does the United States

not continue to have exclusive jurisdiction?

MS. THOMPSON:

QUESTION:

Because the

It does continue to have exclusive

jurisdiction over Federal crimes, doesn't it?

4

MS. THOMPSON:

5

is shared by the State of Kansas.
QUESTION:

6

No.

It's that jurisdiction that

Is it the Government's position that

7

the State of Kansas can try Federal offenses in Kansas

8

courts?

9

MS. THOMPSON:

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. THOMPSON:

12

QUESTION:

No.

That's not the contention.

That's right -The contention is that --

And therefore the United States

13

courts continue to have exclusive jurisdiction over

14

Federal crimes.

15

MS. THOMPSON:

But that's not how it's been --

16

our contention is that the Major Crimes Act is -- defines

17

Federal offenses, and that therefore that fits right in

18

with the proviso of the Kansas statute.

19

has held that in that situation, where you also -- for

20

example, aggravated battery is of course defined by State

21

law, and when it is defined by State law, then the Federal

22

courts and the State courts have concurrent jurisdiction.

23

QUESTION:

The Tenth Circuit

Well, I think there's a little

24

confusion that arises from your use in your brief - - and

25

maybe there's no other term, but usually when you say
7

1

concurrent jurisdiction you mean that two courts have

2

jurisdiction over the same cause of action, or over the

3

same criminal offense.

4

That's not what's at issue here.

What's at issue here is concurrent legislative

5

jurisdiction, in a sense.

6

the State government can make criminal under State law

7

certain acts on the reservation and try those offenses in

8

State court, and the Federal Government may make

9

criminal similar acts under Federal law and try those in

10

That is, the State courts --

Federal courts.
So that the State courts and the Federal courts

11
12

don't have concurrent jurisdiction, they have exclusive

13

jurisdiction of their separate crimes, but it's only the

14

legislative jurisdiction that's concurrent --

15

MS. THOMPSON:

16

QUESTION:

17

That's true.

And that's really what you're talking

about.

18

MS. THOMPSON:

Yes.

19

Since, as this Court stated in Canon v.

20

University of Chicago that Congress acts with knowledge of

21

existing law and, therefore, absent a clear manifestation

22

of contrary intent a newly-enacted statute is presumed to

23

be harmonious with existing law and its judicial

24

construction, any analysis of the Kansas act must be made

25

in conjunction with the Major Crimes Act.

1

Now, the Major Crimes Act was passed by Congress

2

in 1885 to fill the jurisdictional void left by this

3

Court's decision in Ex parte Crow Dog, because prior to

4

the passage of the Major Crimes Act, tribal courts had

5

exclusive jurisdiction over crimes committed within their

6

reservation boundaries.

7

Now, the Major Crimes Act has been interpreted

8

by this Court since United States v. Kagama as vesting

9

exclusive jurisdiction with the Federal courts for an

10

Indian defendant committing one of its enumerated crimes,

11

because the purpose of the act was to provide a Federal

12

forum for the prosecution of major crimes and to protect

13

Indians from prosecution in State court.

14

Now, in United States v. Kagama this Court

15

detailed many reasons why it felt the Federal courts had

16

to have exclusive jurisdiction over these major crimes:

17

1) that Indian Nations were, and continue to be today,

18

wards of the Nation, dependent on the United States

19

Government for all political rights.

20

Secondly, because of local ill feeling, the

21

people of the States where they are found are often their

22

deadliest enemies, and therefore Federal jurisdiction was

23

necessary for their protection.

24

In other words, the purpose of the act was to

25

protect Indians from the prejudices of their non-Indian

1

neighbors, and to preclude State legislative interference

2

in their affairs.

3

Now, despite Kagama and its progeny, the court

4

of appeals found that Congress impliedly modified the

5

exclusivity of the Federal courts under the Major Crimes

6

Act.

7

modify the Major Crimes Act as it pertained to Kansas, it

8

could have done so by passing the first version of the

9

bill, which is found in '86 Congressional Record, 5596,

10

It is our contention that had Congress wished to

and which is set forth verbatim in my brief.
Now, this version expressly provided for

11
12

concurrent jurisdiction, and explicitly modified the Major

13

Crimes Act as it pertained to Kansas.

14

QUESTION:

Well, is it true, as the other side

15

argues, that if it had done that, the act would in fact

16

have constituted a misstatement about concurrent

17

jurisdiction with respect to minor crimes?

18

MS. THOMPSON:

At the time that the act was

19

passed, it was unclear whether or not the Assimilative

20

Crimes Act, the General Crimes Act, applied in Indian

21

country, and that issue was not decided until the decision

22

in Williams v. United States in 1946 --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But it could have been a good

reason - MS. THOMPSON:

By this Court.

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

It could have been a good

reason to drop the word concurrent just because there was
disagreement over that and those who finally passed the
legislation were of one view, i.e., that there was not
jurisdiction over the minor crimes.
MS. THOMPSON:

It could have been a good reason,

but on the other hand, Justice Souter, Congress has
plenary power to deal with Indian affairs.

Had it wanted

to grant concurrent jurisdiction to the State and the
Federal Government under -- well, what became the
Assimilative Crimes Act, it could have done so.
QUESTION:

Well, it could, but it clearly did

not want to do so with respect to minor crimes.
MS. THOMPSON:

That's clear from the history.

It's our contention that deletion of the word
concurrent and the failure to modify the Major Crimes Act
shows that Congress did not intend to grant Kansas
concurrent jurisdiction over major crimes.

Now, both the

Solicitor General and the Attorney General, and, of
course, the court of appeals, excused the failure to
modify and to delete the word concurrent with reference to
Secretary Burlew's letter which is part of the legislative
history of the act, and as you stated, Justice Souter,
because it did not reflect the true situation.
However, as the court in Youngbear held, when

1

legislators delete language, we may assume that they

2

intended to eliminate the effect of the previous wording,

3

and since Congress chose not to include language modifying

4

the Major Crimes Act, it can be assumed that Congress did

5

not intend to convey that jurisdiction to the State

6

courts.

7

QUESTION:

Well, under your view of the meaning

8

of the statute, Ms. Thompson, what jurisdiction is

9

conferred on the Kansas courts by virtue of the first part

10

of 2343 --

11

MS. THOMPSON:

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. THOMPSON:

Our contention --

3243.
I'm sorry.

Our contention,

14

Justice Rehnquist, is that Kansas has jurisdiction over

15

small, misdemeanor crimes, that the Federal Government

16

retains exclusive jurisdiction over major crimes.

17

QUESTION:

Then you really read out of that

18

first language the words, to the same extent as its court

19

have jurisdiction over offenses committed elsewhere within

20

the State in accordance with the laws of the State.

21

MS. THOMPSON:

That's correct, and as we -- as I

22

talked about before, the question as to whether the

23

General Crimes Act and the Assimilative Crimes Act apply

24

to Indian country has been -- this Court has held that,

25

since Williams v. The United States, that they do in fact

1

apply to Indian country.
The Solicitor General brought up a point in his

2

3

brief that, well, exactly what was the scope of

4

jurisdiction given to Kansas?

5

jurisdiction over general crimes or assimilative crimes?

6

I would urge the Court to hold as the -- well,

Who was going to have

7

while the Tenth Circuit has held that assimilative crimes

8

are State offenses, the Ninth Circuit has held in U.S. v.

9

Bear and U.S. v. Marseilles, that when the Federal court

10

adopts these assimilative crimes, that they become Federal

11

offenses, and I would urge the Court to hold that way.
QUESTION:

12

13

Are there Indian tribes in the State

of Kansas which have their own tribal courts?

14

MS. THOMPSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

Yes, Your Honor.

And the tribal courts punish minor

offenses, I take it.

MS. THOMPSON:

example.

And that jurisdiction, I take it,

would be shared by the State of Kansas under your

23

interpretation.

24

MS. THOMPSON:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

All right.

So, then, it's not

13

SUITE 400

1

correct to say that Kansas has exclusive jurisdiction over

2

minor crimes, is it?

3

MS. THOMPSON:

No, I do not believe that it is.

4

It's just the fact that -- well, one of the reasons for

5

the law was the fact that there was a lack of tribal

6

courts, and that the Bureau of Indian Affairs was very

7

reluctant to provide funding for the tribal courts.

8

had to be a forum where these small offenses could be
adjudicated.

10
11

There

Now, of course, the tribal courts are

hearing these offenses.
Again, if we take as an example when Congress

12

wishes to convey criminal jurisdiction, Congress makes

13

that intent unequivocally clear, as it did with Public

14

Law 280 jurisdiction -- in particular, 18 U.S. Code 1162,

15

which granted criminal jurisdiction to six States, and the

16

law specifically modified the Major Crimes Act, the

17

General Crimes Act and the Assimilative Crimes Act as it

18

pertained to those States.

1

It -- and, of course, P.L. 280 was passed by

20

Congress in 1 53, only a few years after they passed the

21

Iowa statute in 1 48.

22

Congress wished to convey total criminal jurisdiction to

23

the State of Kansas, they would have specifically set this

24

forth in the statute.

25

It seems only logical that had

1

intent, the interpretation of the statute by the Tenth

2

Circuit Court of Appeals by the Attorney General and the

3

Solicitor General violates the rules of statutory

4

construction, which is applicable to Indians.

5

For example, laws must be liberally construed to

6

favor Indians, and ambiguous statutes should be liberally

7

construed in the favor of Indians and not to their

8

prejudice.

9

County.

That, of course, comes from Bryan v. Itasca

10

To interpret the Kansas act as the court of

11

appeals has done would, 1) eliminate the historically

12

exclusive stewardship of the Federal Government over major

13

crimes as found in Kagama, and secondly it would subject

14

Indians in Kansas, in Iowa, in North Dakota to a double

15

prosecution.
QUESTION:

16

Well, on the other hand, you could

17

look upon it as granting Indian tribes the great benefit

18

of being protected by two criminal laws, Federal law and

19

State law.

20

as local law enforcement officers.

21

They can get the FBI to protect them as well

I do not know why, in determining whether

22

Indians are being harmed or benefited by this

23

interpretation, we have to look at it from the point of

24

view of the Indian criminal instead of from the point of

25

view of the Indian noncriminal.

Why isn't it an advantage

1

to the Indian tribes to be protected by both State and

2

Federal criminal laws?

3

MS. THOMPSON:

Justice Scalia, we're -- I am not

4

looking at this from the point of the Indian criminal.

5

am looking at this from the point of Indian and tribal

6

sovereignty.

7

The more State interference --

QUESTION:

They don't have sovereignty anyway.

8

I mean, the criminal law is going to -- it's not tribal

9

criminal law that's going to govern, no matter what,

10

I

right?
MS. THOMPSON:

11

No, it's going to be the State,

12

but again, we're looking at this from the -- because the

13

criminal -- the Indian criminal defendant, he's going to

14

be punished one way or the other, whether it's State court

15

or Federal court, but we're looking at this as an

16

intrusion basically on the rights of the tribes to make

17

their own laws and govern themselves.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I thought the Indians supported

19

the Major Crimes Act on the assumption the States would

20

have the power.
MS. THOMPSON:

22

Do you mean supported this Kansas

MS. THOMPSON:

1

Well, as brought out in the brief

2

by amici Native American Rights Fund, as it turns out that

3

at least one tribe, the Potawatomi Tribe, did not support

4

the passage of this act, and in the letters that the

chairman of the Potawatomi Tribe wrote to Chairman Rogers,

it is quite clear that they disagreed with the passage of

would you still say that that could not be applied

Yes, because of -- again because

of the exclusivity of Federal courts under the Major

In that letter, the Congressman, who of course

was elected by the people on or near the reservation,

states that all parties are agreed that the State of

Now, the Solicitor General and the Attorney

that letter perhaps should not be given the full credence

that it should, because, again there is no mention in that

Potawatomi Business Council, in those letters the author

12

of the letters also referred to another Potawatomi

13

Business Council, but he didn't agree with that council,

14

so there was obviously a split of some kind in the tribe,

15

but - - and they also indicated in the letter that they

16

realized that this would maintain full jurisdiction to the

17

State of Kansas, and seemed to be more concerned about an

18

attempt by Brown and Jackson Counties in Kansas to collect

19

taxes, and they thought this was a guise to collect taxes

that evidently they'd received a judgment for in a Federal

I notice the Court's looking at the map, I

5

The overriding issue in this case is over the

6

words, exclusive jurisdiction, as used in section 1153,

the Major Crimes Act, and do these words mean that the

8

Federal Government has exclusivity over Indian country,

9

thereby precluding the State from exercising jurisdiction

10

over the major crimes listed, or do these words identify

11

the body of law that is to be applied by the Federal

12

courts when conducting a prosecution over crimes committed

13

in Indian country?

14

The words, exclusive jurisdiction in the Major

15

Crimes Act does not mean that the Federal Government has

exclusive jurisdiction to prosecution.

MR. STEPHAN:

That issue has never been met

by - - I am convinced at this point that certainly the

9

better line of thought is that there would be nothing to

prevent a prosecution by both the Federal and the State

QUESTION:

12

In order for that result to obtain,

13

is it necessary to say that what the Federal Government

has done is to acquiesce in the exercise of State

Is that the way it works?
MR. STEPHAN:

16

I don't know that there's

acquiescence, because the State is not required to

instances, and the same is true in regard to Indian

That's like in Barkus v. Illinois,

4

MR. STEPHAN:

The term, exclusive jurisdiction,

5

is an extension of the laws on Federal enclaves, and is

6

not -- the exclusive jurisdiction is not maintained from

7

the language of the act itself, but from the fact that in

8

the Major Crimes Act no authority is delegated to the

9

States.

10

QUESTION:

Well, you say that, but I find within

11

the act itself the word, other, that certainly suggests to

12

me that the act at least implies exclusivity.

13

Now, one can argue that it is nonetheless

14

subsequently amended by 3243, but it seems to me the word,

15

other, does imply that an Indian perpetrator is within the

16

exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.

17

MR. STEPHAN:

Well, the Major Crimes Act was

18

originally enacted as a result of the Crow Dog case that

19

said they did not have - - that the Federal Government did

not have jurisdiction on the reservation in regard to a

21

particular murder case where one Indian murdered another

It served the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM K. KELLEY

4

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

5

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KELLEY:

6

7

may it please the Court:
I just have a few points to make.

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

First, on the

language of the statute, it's quite clear, in our view,

10

that the statute gave Kansas complete jurisdiction to

11

prosecute offenses to the full extent of State law.
The second sentence of the statute, it seems to

12

13

us, merely maintained Federal jurisdiction where it

14

existed.

15

Act to give the State jurisdiction over a crime under

16

State law, because after the passage of section 3243 and

17

before, the Federal courts had jurisdiction to entertain

18

major crimes prosecutions under section 1153.

19

It is not an implied repeal of the Major Crimes

Now, petitioner has referred to the first

20

version of the bill and its inclusion of the word,

21

concurrent, and the reference to modification of the Major

22

Crimes Act as indicating that Congress must have meant

23

something different in the final version of the bill.

24
25

In fact, we think Congress did mean something
different, and it's fully explained in the legislative

1

history what Congress meant.

Prior to the passage --

2

excuse me, at the time this statute was under

3

consideration, the Federal Government did not have

4

jurisdiction over so-called minor crimes under what is now

5

section 1152 between two Indians.

6

does not have that jurisdiction today.

7

however, that under the Kansas act the State has

8

jurisdiction over minor crimes between two Indians.

The Federal Government
It's quite clear,

Moreover, at the time the act was under

9
10

consideration there was some uncertainty as to the

11

applicability of the Assimilative Crimes Act in Indian

12

country.

13

Court's decision 6 years later in Williams v. United

14

States, but it's quite clear that Congress meant, by

15

removing the word, concurrent from the final version of

16

the bill, to make clear that Kansas had more jurisdiction

17

than the Federal Government had to that point.

18

amendment was intended to make the bill broader rather

19

than narrower than the first version.

That uncertainty, of course, was removed by the

Thus, the

Now, another problem in petitioner's position,

20
21

of course, is that the modification referred to in the

22

first version of the bill referred to what was

23

then -- what has now become section 1152, so-called minor

24

crimes.

25

that that's all the State was granted jurisdiction over.

Petitioner's position in this Court, however, is

If the removal of the modification of the Major

1

2

Crimes Act reference in the version of the bill was

3

intended to retain exclusive jurisdiction over major

4

crimes prosecutions, the same must be true of jurisdiction

5

over section 1152 prosecutions.

6

not have jurisdiction over minor crimes involving Indians

7

unless Congress grants it.
Thus, the petitioner can have it one way but not

8

9
10

The States generally do

both, it seems to us.

That is, under her view, there

should be no concurrent jurisdiction at all.
QUESTION:

11

You say under her view, then, or

12

under the petitioner's view, the Kansas courts would have

13

gotten no additional jurisdiction under the first

14

sentence.

15

MR. KELLEY:

Well, the Kansas courts would have

16

gotten jurisdiction, Mr. Chief Justice, over minor crimes

17

between two Indians, because Federal jurisdiction did not

18

exist over those crimes then, and it does not today, and

19

there's some question whether Kansas would have had

20

jurisdiction over assimilative crimes that are defined by

21

reference to State law rather than general Federal crimes

22

defined by reference to Federal law.

23

The proviso in the Kansas act refers to not

24

depriving Federal courts of jurisdiction over offenses

25

defined by Federal law, and if assimilative crimes are

1

viewed as being defined by reference to State law, then an

2

argument can be made that the State would have

3

jurisdiction over those offenses as well.

4

But it's quite clear that Congress meant to

5

grant the State more than concurrent jurisdiction.

6

is, more than the Federal courts had.

7

clear, however, that Congress meant to preserve Federal

major crimes jurisdiction.

With respect to the lack of clarity as to the

20

consent of the tribes at the time, Justice Stevens, in

21

response to your question earlier, it is somewhat unclear

22

from history what the positions of the tribes were.

23

General Stephan mentioned, there was some question as to

24

the legitimacy of the Potawatomi Business Committee that

25

sent the letter at issue.

As

We would submit, of course, that the Secretary

1

2

of Interior was the person in a position to determine

3

which group spoke for the tribe. All we know from the

4

legislative history is that the executive branch

5

understood the four tribes to want the legislation, and

6

Congress, of course, acted on that understanding, so to

7

the extent that we're trying to determine the meaning of

8

what Congress enacted, its understanding of what the

9

tribes wanted at the time, of course, should be what

10
11
12

counts.
Now that, of course, does not undermine our
position that the canon and the statutes should be

3

construed liberally in favor of Indians does not warrant a

4

different result here for at least two reasons:

5

unclear that the canon urged by petitioner is in favor of

6

the Indians generally.

7

but the concerns that animated this statute were to

8

protect tribal law and order on the reservations at the

19

time, and we submit that it was in the interests of the

20

Indians for that statute to be passed for that end.

Moreover, no canon of construction can overcome

what we regard as the plain language of the statute, and

of course it's quite plain legislative history.

Ms. Thompson, you have 3 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. THOMPSON

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

Thank you, Mr. Kelley.

MS. THOMPSON:

The first point I'd like to make

7

is regarding the argument of double jeopardy.

8

our contention that the State of Kansas, when it's acting

9

under this law, and the Federal Government - - the State of

It's not

10

Kansas when it's acting under this law is some sort of an

11

arm of the United States Government.
Our contention has always been that the United

States Government is one sovereign and the State of Kansas

14

is another sovereign, and therefore an Indian person

could,

State courts.

conceivably, be left wide open to double

Secondly,

regarding the legislative history of

19

the act, again I would urge the Court to give full

20

credence to what Congressman Lambertson said in his

21

letter -- that the State of Kansas was to get full

22

jurisdiction for small offenses.

23

This is an expression of the will of Congress.

24

If the State of Kansas was to have jurisdiction --

25

concurrent jurisdiction over major crimes,

certainly

1

Congressman Lambertson would have put that in his letter.

2

It would have taken another five or six words to say, and

3

the State will have concurrent jurisdiction over major

4

crimes.

5

Taking into consideration the fact that, as this

6

Court has held for the past

7

in the Federal court over the major crimes is exclusive

technically under this law, that does not do away with the

exclusivity of the Federal courts.

does, because if the laws -QUESTION:

the textual point, it would have been very simple in the

second sentence simply to add one more word.

been the textually easier way to get to the point that you

8

want us to reach, and yet Congress didn't follow that.

MS. THOMPSON:

No, they did not do that, and

20

again, when they -- Congress in

21

passing Public Law 280, they were very specific in

granting the States given criminal jurisdiction that the

Major Crimes Act and the General Crimes Act and the

Assimilative Crimes Act would be modified accordingly.

they were in favor of the bill.
