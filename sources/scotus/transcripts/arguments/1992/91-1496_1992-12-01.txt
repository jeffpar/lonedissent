Mr. Phillips.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

9

We'll hear argument

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Court is required in this case to reconcile

10
11

two core commands of the Interstate Commerce Act.

The

12

first is that the carrier shall charge and collect only

13

the filed tariff rate, and the second is that the carrier

14

shall not charge or collect a rate that is unreasonable.

15

In this case petitioners, who previously paid all that the

16

carrier charged in order to ship goods, have been ordered

17

in effect to pay what they claim to be unreasonably high

18

rates.

Petitioners, on behalf of the entire shipping --

19

QUESTION:

Which was the filed rate.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

Which was the filed rate.
That was the filed rate, yes,

23

Your Honor, the one that petitioners take the position and

24

argue in defense that it was unreasonably high.

25

Petitioners on behalf of the entire shipping industry,

1

which faces claims similar to this one in amounts in

2

excess of billions of dollars, urge the Court to reject

3

the categorical approach proposed by the respondents and

4

adopted by the court of appeals in much the same way that

5

the Court rejected an all or nothing solution to this same

6

problem 2 years ago in the Maislin decision.

7

Instead what the Court should do is to resolve,

8

is to have these issues resolved on a case-by-case basis

9

with the issue of the rate reasonableness decided by the

10

Interstate Commerce Commission subject to judicial review

11

of the Commission's exercise of primary jurisdiction.

12

QUESTION:

Is it your position that even if the

13

carrier filed, charged, sent a bill for the filed rate and

14

the shipper said the rate is unreasonable, should that

15

defense await a ruling by the --

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

No, no, Justice White, that

defense should not await a ruling.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

In that situation --

Why not?
Section 10743, a separate

20

provision, separate from the filed rate doctrine which is

21

embodied in section 10761(a), specifically provides that

22

the carrier has a right to insist upon payment at the time

23

of the movement of the goods.

24

the pay first rule which is essentially a rule that the

25

Court has acknowledged in passing on a number of old

And that is the source of

1

cases, but that rule has a separate statutory basis.

2

not inherent in the filed rate doctrine, and therefore our

3

position is that if you insist on the payment, and even if

4

the payment is too high in your judgment, you are obliged

5

to follow that because Congress made a specific

6

determination that that's the proper course to follow.

7

It's

In contrast, Justice White, in this case where

8

the payments were made in full and then additional sums

9

were requested that the - -

10

QUESTION:

A negotiated rate was paid?

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

A negotiated rate was paid and

12

then a subsequent request was made.

13

statute specifically deals with that particular situation,

14

and when you're in a no-man's land then it seems to us a

15

different set of rules ought to apply.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Nothing in the

But it was a rate, it was a

negotiated rate that the carrier had no business charging?
MR. PHILLIPS:

That's true.

The carrier was,

19

acted unlawfully in charging that rate at the time.

20

should have filed those rates.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

He

Didn't the shipper also?
No, if you -- the provision,

23

section 19761 and 10762 both provide that it is the

24

carrier's duty to comply with the law.

25

shipper has an interest, and after Maislin has an interest

Certainly the

1

that is quite significant in insuring that the tariffs are

2

in fact filed, but the duty itself clearly resides with

3

the carrier under these circumstances.
QUESTION:

4

Well, Mr. Phillips, I guess the

5

shipper would have access to the public information to

6

know whether the rate had been filed or not.
MR. PHILLIPS:

7

It is true in a theoretical sense

8

that the shipper has access, but I think it is as a

9

practical matter quite unreasonable to expect the shipper

10

to be able consistently to monitor changing tariff rates

11

that can be implemented on 24-hours notice, when if you

12

were to just look at the Carolina tariffs they are six

13

volumes long, they reference additional tariffs that are

14

themselves three and four volumes long.

15

about tariff filings that are in the nature of thousands

16

of pages, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

17

We're talking

May I ask whether your client was

18

time-barred from seeking reparations at the time that the

19

respondents here first tried to collect the alleged

20

undercharges?

Is there a time barr in effect?

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

As to some portions they would

22

have been, some of the earlier shipments I think would

23

have been barred.

24

barred.

situation where the trustee has brought the suit for

Later shipments would not have been

So we're not in the more, I think more typical

1

undercharges at a period in time when the shippers are not

2

permitted to seek reparations.

3

QUESTION:

And does the time barr affect the

4

ability under your position to go back to the ICC for the

5

reasonableness determination?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Absolutely, Justice O'Connor,

7

that is this Court's decision in United States v. Western

8

Pacific where the Court held that where the United States

9

refused to pay and was sued for undercharges and the

10

carriers, the carrier in that case, just as the

11

respondents in this case, said the way to do this is to

12

pay the filed rate and seek reparations.

13

said that's, you can't do that because reparations are

14

time-barred.

15

appropriate for this particular case the Court said to

16

hold otherwise would require the Court to condone a

17

situation where the carrier is permitted to obtain

18

unreasonable rates with impunity.

And the Court

And in language that I think is strikingly

19

That is precisely the situation that we have

20

here because everyone conceded at the court of appeals

21

level that if these rates turn out to be unreasonable they

22

are essentially lost because the carrier is insolvent and

23

it's going to be impossible to recoup monies.

24

circumstances what you have is a situation where the

25

shipper's significant right under the statute not to be

Under those

1

charged unreasonable rates is essentially vitiated in

2

favor of an unbending absolute rule under the filed rate

3

doctrine, which this Court has never held to be applicable

4

in that particular way.
QUESTION:

5

Could the bankruptcy court collect

6

the full amount of the filed rate and just hold it until

7

such time as you have had a reasonable opportunity to go

8

to the ICC?
MR. PHILLIPS:

9

The bankruptcy court, I think

10

there's no question the bankruptcy court would have that

11

authority.

12

first of all there's nothing in the court of appeals'

13

opinion that would authorize that because the court of

14

appeals has categorically denied us the opportunity to

15

stay the payment and there is nothing in any of the

16

bankruptcy court or the Fourth Circuit's analysis that

17

even envisions that kind of a procedure.

18

really in the case.

19

The problem with that particular approach is,

So it's not

But second of all, in, given the magnitude of

20

the undercharges that are at issue here it seems quite

21

extraordinary to think about billions of dollars being

22

placed in the registry when there is no serious reason to

23

wonder whether in fact these charges are reasonable.

24

fact the more likely scenario is that these charges are

25

quite unreasonable, having not been reviewed as they have

In

1

increased over the period of time.
And therefore it seems to us the more

2

3

appropriate course is if a carrier has reason to believe

4

that a shipper will be unable to pay the filed rate if

5

ultimately determined to be reasonable, then it seems to

6

me the shipper, or, excuse me, the carrier can come

7

forward in either the bankruptcy court or before the ICC

8

and seek to have some protection put in place.

9

QUESTION:

Well, just before you leave that

10

point, it's not at all clear to me that a district court

11

or bankruptcy court can alter the priority of creditors by

12

an equitable subordination of liens that are otherwise

13

equal.

I mean, where, where do you get that authority?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the question is whether you

15

put it into the bankruptcy estate in the first instance.

16

I agree with you, once it gets into the bankrupt estate

17

it's clear that you can't modify how the creditors

18

receive --

19

QUESTION:

Well, but if bankruptcy courts could

20

do this they could have escrows all the time which would

21

basically alter the provision the Congress has for the

22

priority of creditors and for their equal right to share

23

in proceeds.

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

QUESTION:

But I think --

And I don't see where this authority

comes from.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well,

it doesn't -- I mean,

to be

honest with you I'm happy to abandon the position that
there's authority to do it.

I would have been inclined to

assume that as an equitable matter the bankruptcy court
could, given that we don't know the legality, the
underlying legality, and it's necessary to have the issue
resolved by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the
exercise of its primary jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Well, you don't argue this in your

brief and there's no citation in the brief to support the
bankruptcy court's authority to do this,
MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

is there?

No, Your Honor, there is

none.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, as I recall your brief

you ask that the, what should happen is the bankruptcy
court should refer this matter to the ICC?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Any one of the courts would have

been fine, but yes, Your Honor, since it was tried
initially before the bankruptcy court we thought the
matter should have been referred to the ICC.
QUESTION:
it?

I mean,

What authority does it have to refer

I have heard of, you know, where the doctrine

of primary jurisdiction applies I have heard of courts

1

staying proceedings until one of the parties had an

2

opportunity to make use of an available proceeding before

3

the ICC or the FCC or another agency, but I have never

4

heard of a power in the court to direct an agency to make

5

some determination.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

It may well be that we are simply

7

employing a short-hand means of accomplishing precisely

8

what you're describing, Justice Scalia.

9

that we care that the matter be specifically referred by

10

any court to the ICC, but that we have an opportunity as

11

shippers to have the rate reasonableness determined

12

initially by the ICC.

13

QUESTION:

Well, is there a proceeding before

14

the ICC that would enable you to do that?

15

there a mechanism - -

19
20

It's not so much

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, is

Oh, yes, I mean the Interstate

Commerce - QUESTION:

-- whereby if the court stays its

hand you can get this issue before the ICC?
MR. PHILLIPS:

The Interstate Commerce

21

Commission has a policy statement, order 177 and 208, both

22

of which say that they will entertain these kinds of

23

claims and resolve the question of rate reasonableness,

24

and in fact in the Oneida case that was recently decided

25

by the Interstate Commerce Commission that is precisely

1

what they did do.

2

reasonableness issue and went forward.

3

there is a mechanism, to be sure.

4

They undertook to decide the rate
So there are,

Let me just add one last idea, or at least one

5

set of concepts to the mix in this case.

One significant

6

line of decisions from this Court that it seems to me

7

supports the underlying decision of the ICC to provide

8

this relief is the Interstate Commerce Commission v.

9

American Trucking Associations case, where this Court has

10

upheld extraordinary remedies in situations where they

11

were directly aimed at a particular problem that the

12

statute otherwise does not remedy, and that is precisely

13

what this case is about.

14

however, has taken a contrary view its judgment should be

15

reversed.

16
17

Because the court of appeals,

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, Mr.
Chief Justice.

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether a court

SUITE 400

1

should refer to the ICC a shipper's defense that the filed

2

rate is unreasonable in an undercharge action brought by

3

an insolvent carrier.

4

for three reasons.

5

The answer to that question is yes,

First, referral is required to protect the ICC's

6

primary jurisdiction over the reasonableness of rates.

7

Second, referral is necessary to give the shipper an

8

effective remedy against having to pay unreasonable rates

9

charged under a carrier's tariff.
QUESTION:

10

Well, what if the carrier had an

11

effective remedy to recover reparations?

12

that it would be necessary for the court to hold its hand?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Would you say

No, Justice White, we don't say

14

that it would be necessary for the court to hold its hand

15

if the shipper did have an effective remedy in

16

reparations.

17

QUESTION:

So you would not apply, you would not

18

apply, you would not apply primary jurisdiction where the

19

carrier, where the shipper paid a negotiated rate that was

20

lower than the filed rate and the carrier then sued for

21

the balance?
MR. DREEBEN:

22

23

Well, that is this case, of

course.

24

QUESTION:

I know it is.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

But the reason why reparations is

1

inadequate in this case is because the carrier is

2

insolvent.

3

QUESTION:

I understand.

I understand.

But

4

absent, if the carrier -- if the shipper had a opportunity

5

for reparations you would not apply the primary

6

jurisdiction rule?

7
8

MR. DREEBEN:

presents the Court with the requirement of ruling on it.
QUESTION:

9
10

I know, I know, but what's the United

States' position on that?
MR. DREEBEN:

11

12

We don't think that this case

The United States' position is

that there isn't any need to bring the primary

3

jurisdiction doctrine into play through a referral

4

procedure when reparations are truly available, and that

5

is

6

QUESTION:

7

shipper here in that regard?

8
9

So you do, you do not agree with the

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I don't think that the

shipper here is taking any position that's different from

20

that.

The whole reason why this issue is before the Court

21

today is that there is a rash of collection actions

22

throughout the motor carrier industry in which bankrupt

23

carriers or their trustees are culling through old tariffs

24

and seeking to collect monies that are substantially in

25

excess of what were charged at the time, and they are

1

doing so in a way that gives the shippers no opportunity

2

to challenge the reasonableness of those rates in a way

3

that would be effective.

4

QUESTION:

You're saying, Mr. Dreeben, that then

5

your view of the situation contemplates at least the

6

possibility that the role would be different in bankruptcy

7

than outside of bankruptcy?

8

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

we don't think the rule has to be different depending on

10

the fact of bankruptcy or not.

11

whether there is an adequate remedy in reparations that

12

would allow the statutory mechanism to work.

13

principle is exemplified in this Court's decision in

14

United States v. Western Pacific where the Court held that

15

when the United States' reparation action was time-barred

16

it was permitted to raise the defense of rate

17

unreasonableness in a collection action.

18

The key question is

That

That underlying principle was also expressed in

19

this Court's decision in Crancer v. Lowden where the Court

20

found that there was no abuse of discretion by a district

21

court in going forward with a collection action when the

22

shipper did have an adequate remedy in reparations.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, at the outset of your

24

presentation you referred to referral to the ICC is

25

necessary for three reasons, and you repeated the

2

referral.

What do you mean by referral to the ICC?
MR. DREEBEN:

We mean, Justice Scalia, the same

3

thing that Mr. Phillips described, and this Court has used

4

the same sort of short-hand.

5

that's hearing the action in which an issue arises that

6

can only be decided by the agency, it will stay its

7

proceedings and it will allow the parties to file a

8

complaint before the administrative agency in order to

9

raise the issue.

10

QUESTION:

As you stated, the court

But it's up to the parties to take

11

the initiative to go before the agency, and up to the

12

agency to accept that proceeding or not?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I wouldn't rule out the

14

possibility of a court sua sponte concluding that the

15

issue, that the case raised an issue that it could not

16

decide and that an agency had to decide, and staying its

17

proceedings to give the parties an opportunity to do so.

18

That really hasn't been a problem in this case or in the

19

pattern of cases in this industry.

20

seeking to bring the issue before the Interstate Commerce

21

Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission has

22

issued a policy statement that expresses its willingness

23

to hear on complaint precisely this kind of claim.

24
25

QUESTION:

Shippers have been

But all we're really talking about is

a stay of proceedings which the bankruptcy court

1

undoubtedly has the power to achieve, and the issue is

2

simply whether it's appropriate in this situation or not.

3
4

MR. DREEBEN:

That is exactly what the issue is.

Now, the Court -QUESTION:

5

In a situation like this in which

6

bankruptcy is the context in which the issue arises, is

7

there any issue of discretion in your view on the part of

8

the bankruptcy court once it determines that there is a

9

genuine issue about the reasonableness of the rates?

10

MR. DREEBEN:

11

QUESTION:

12

3

No.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just a couple of quick points.

to clarify the record in this case.

that the rates would not be filed and therefore acted

MR. PHILLIPS:

that Mr. Steinfeld asked is how will we know who is

solvent, when.

Well, I don't know how we'll know who's

10

solvent in the future, but the one thing I know absolutely

11

is who is insolvent today, and that's Carolina Motors.
QUESTION:

12

But isn't that the essential

13

injustice?

14

injustice that you concede is there in the act, that the

15

carrier who was at fault for all of this can nonetheless

16

come and collect the rate, and if he happens to go

insolvent the next day you're just straight out of luck.

Isn't that the essential injustice?

that that is there in the statute.

there is an injustice.
