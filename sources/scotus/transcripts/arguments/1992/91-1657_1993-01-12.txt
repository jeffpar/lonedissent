CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD GLADDEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. GLADDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case, the petitioners challenge what's

12

known as the Fifth Circuit's heightened pleading

13

requirement, which that court applies in civil rights

14

cases brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C., section 1983 with

15

respect to allegations against local governmental entities

16

wherein plaintiffs allege that the local governmental

17

entity has failed to adequately train, allegations similar

18

to those presented in City of Canton v. Harris.

19

It's the petitioners' contention that the

20

heightened pleading requirement violates the system of

21

notice pleading set out in rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal

22

Rules of Civil Procedure, and alternatively, to the extent

23

that a heightened pleading requirement is permissible

24

under rule 8, petitioners go further and state that they

25

believe that that violates the rule's enabling act, title

28 U.S.C., section 2072(b).
Before going much further, I would like to

3

briefly outline for the Court the procedural and factual

4

background which led to this case.

5

The case originally arose out of a search of the

6

Leatherman residence which occurred in May of 1989.

7

that case, governmental officers, under the control of the

8

Tarrant County narcotics task force, secured a search

9

warrant for their premises and upon entering the premises

10

shot and killed two of their dogs, and after discovering,

11

just within moments, that there was no narcotics

12

laboratory within the premises, proceeded to lounge about

13

in the front of the yard, basically just kind of enhancing

14

and aggravating the anxiety that the family was already

15

experiencing.

16

In

Mrs. Leatherman and her son Travis were there on

17

the premises at the time the dogs were shot - - or at the

18

end of the driveway, some 100 feet away.

19

lawsuit in State court pursuant to section 1983 alleging a

20

violation of the Fourth Amendment with respect to the

21

manner in which the search was conducted by the officers

22

and the shooting of their dogs, which they considered to

23

be an unreasonable seizure of their effect, the dog being

24

the effect in question.

25

They filed a

former counsel filed the case in State court and was

2

unable, prior to filing it in State court, to get access

3

to any documents to identify the individual officers.

4

made numerous attempts to try to secure documents which

5

would more particularly describe what customs they may

6

have and what prior incidents might have occurred similar

7

to this.

8

9

He was unable to do so.
Following the filing of his complaint and our

petition in State court, the respondents immediately

10

removed the case to Federal court, and immediately

11

thereafter filed a motion to dismiss on 12(b) or for

12

summary judgment.

13

He

The petitioner -- the Leatherman petitioners'

14

former counsel had not been admitted to practice in

15

Federal court and while he was trying to locate other

16

counsel to handle the case, the court initially acted on

17

the motion to dismiss and dismissed the case.

18

Following my becoming involved in the case, I

19

moved the court to vacate the dismissal and allow the

20

petitioners to replea their complaint, if possible to

21

conform to the technical pleading requirements that the

22

court in the Fifth Circuit or courts in the Fifth Circuit

23

apply, specifically the heightened pleading requirement.

24
25

During the course in time in which we were
drafting the amended complaint, our office became aware of

1

another incident also involving the Tarrant County drug

2

task force wherein the officers had displayed similar lack

3

of supervision with respect to the entry of the residence

4

unannounced, clubbing of an elderly gentleman, remaining

5

on the premises some hour and a half to 2 hours after

6

determining that there was no drugs on the premises or

7

drug laboratory on the premises.
I came to the conclusion that there was a

8

9

consistent pattern there, and for that reason, pursuant to

10

20(a), rule 20(a), I added this separate incident,

11

together with the Leathermans' lawsuit.
QUESTION:

12

13

Rule 20(a) of the Rules of Civil

Procedure?

14

MR. GLADDEN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GLADDEN:

Yes, Chief Justice.

What does that provide?
Chief Justice, if I recollect, it

17

says that you have a common transaction in question

18

element.

19

identified source and you have common legal questions or

20

common factual questions, the rules permit a joinder of

21

what would otherwise seem to be separate incidences if you

22

have a common factual question or a common legal question.

If you have a pattern of actions by the same

the time it acted or entered its decision as to what legal

2

authority.

3

respondents, and therefore it had never been briefed.

The issue had never been raised by the

4

In any event, following the amended complaint

5

being filed, the respondent, TCNICU, who I'll just call

6

the drug task force, filed virtually the identical motion

7

to dismiss or for summary judgment, and at that time

8

attached some unverified police reports and such like that

9

that allowed us to get a little bit more information, but

10

still not enough to recognize on an evidentiary basis

11

sufficient facts to perhaps defend a motion for summary

12

j udgment.

13

At that time, I filed a motion to stay action on

14

the motion for summary judgment pursuant to rule 56(f)

15

because there had not been sufficient discovery from my

16

position to feel comfortable with the court acting on it

17

at that time, and that was also briefed in the district

18

court in response to their motion for summary judgment.

19

In response -- discovery or motion for -- excuse

20

me - - production of documents, the respondent drug task

21

force filed a motion for a protective order, and they

22

claimed, I believe, four different privileges, including

23

executive privilege, why they shouldn't have to disclose

24

any documents in connection with the operation of their

25

drug task force.

As a result, the court, the district

1

court, entered a protective order and prevented me from

2

getting any other documents other than those voluntarily

3

provided by the drug task force.

4

asked for a hearing on that, and the hearing was denied.

5

Some -- and I had also

Some 3 weeks later, the court granted their

motion to dismiss based on the heightened pleading

7

requirement, but went further and acted on the motion for

summary judgment.

9

Circuit only affirmed on the basis of the heightened

And, however, on appeal the Fifth

10

pleading requirement.

11

procedural posture of the case.

12

That pretty much concludes the

It's the petitioners' position that there are

13

several reasons why the heightened pleading requirement is

14

inconsistent with the notice pleading that this Court set

15

out in Conley v. Gibson.

16

said that fair -- that a plaintiff under rule 8 -- and

17

that was yet again a case where the people, the

18

respondents, had said that you had to have specific

19

allegations to support your claims, and the Court in

20

response to that said that under rule 8 a plaintiff only

21

need show fair notice of their claim and the grounds upon

22

which it rests.

23

In Conley v. Gibson, the Court

We believe that in this case, the respondent

24

certainly had fair notice of both the legal and factual

25

basis of the claim with respect to the constitutional

1

allegation and certainly had an understanding that the

2

theory of relief was pursuant to City of Canton v. Harris.

3

They were so able to understand the allegations that they

4

were able to file a motion for summary judgment.

5

However, they didn't provide any documentation

6

with respect to what their training was or whether there

7

had been prior incidences.

8

protective order had been entered, I was unable to get

9

such documents.

10

Yet again, because the

It's our position that not only does rule 8 and

11

Conley v. Gibson preclude any understanding of rule 8 to

12

allow a heightened pleading requirement, but we also

13

believe that rule 9(b) certainly read in harmony with rule

14

8 would negate the possibility of a heightened pleading

15

requirement.

16

QUESTION:

Well, is there some indication or do

17

you believe, I - - do you think the district judge would

18

have allowed you the discovery that he previously didn't

19

allow you if he had denied the motion to dismiss?

20

MR. GLADDEN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. GLADDEN:

23

QUESTION:

I have no way of knowing.

Because -That would be just speculation.

You know, one of the things you're

24

telling us about is how you couldn't get any information

25

through discovery, and I'm wondering how that is related

1

to the heightened pleading requirement.
MR. GLADDEN:

2

Well, Your Honor, I think the

3

court denied the discovery, and it's my impression that he

4

denied the discovery on the basis that the heightened

5

pleading requirement foreclosed the lawsuit proceeding

6

further to discovery because under a heightened pleading

7

requirement, you wouldn't be allowed discovery unless you

8

could get through a motion to dismiss.

9

QUESTION:

So, then perhaps your answer to my

10

question should be yes, that had the district court denied

11

the motion to dismiss, it would have been more lenient

12

about allowing discovery.

13

MR. GLADDEN:

I certainly think so.

I think in

14

the absence of a heightened pleading requirement, he would

15

have been more lenient.

16

cited in support of denying discovery was connected or

17

intertwined with cases involving the heightened pleading

18

requirement.

19

Most of the case law that he

Back to rule 9 (b), another suggestion we have or

20

argument we have is that 9(b) sets out what kinds of

21

claims there are that require particularity in pleading

22

complaints.

23

is there any mention of a heightened pleading requirement

24

for civil rights cases or some unidentified other class of

25

cases.

It's limited to fraud and mistake.

Nowhere

1

And then it goes on to say that allegations

2

involving knowledge, malice, intent, or other condition of

3

mind, which I think in this case deliberate indifference

4

on the part of the municipal policymaker would certainly

5

be a condition of mind -- rule 9(b) says that only general

6

allegations are required with respect to pleading.

7

Now, it seems to me that throughout this

8

litigation, both the respondents and the lower courts, not

9

necessarily Judge Goldberg, but they have concluded -- or

10

they have confused the difference between a rule for

11

summary judgment where evidence has to be pled and

12

presented and a motion to dismiss where you are only

13

required to give fair notice of the claim that you're

14

presenting.

15

I would say again the respondents in this case

16

had fair notice of what the factual basis of the

17

constitutional allegation was, and they had fair notice,

18

at least to my ability to plead it, that we were

19

challenging the inadequacy of their training and that we

20

believed, on information and belief, that there were other

21

incidences that would support our claim.

22

Justice Scalia has, on more than one occasion,

23

stated that we should apply the text to the rules and not

24

improve upon them.

25

who have imposed the heightened pleading requirement have

It seems to me that the lower courts

1

done so in an effort to improve upon what they consider to

2

be a problem with the Federal rules in protecting

3

municipalities.

4

Independence addressed the question of whether

5

municipalities are entitled to qualified immunity, and the

6

Court ruled that it wasn't.

7

The City of Owen -- or Owen v. City of

This heightened pleading requirement originally

8

derived out of the need to protect individual defendants

9

who had a right to assert qualified immunity from broad

10

ranging discovery.

11

a problem with limiting broad ranging discovery in any

12

case under rule 16.

13

could isolate issues and allow discovery to go forward on

14

that basis.

15

QUESTION:

I don't think that there's necessarily

I think a district judge certainly

How about a heightened pleading rule

16

where you're dealing with individuals who will claim

17

qualified immunity?

18

MR. GLADDEN:

Well, I don't think that -- first

19

of all, I don't think that issue is presented to the

20

Court, but I would take the position in Anderson v.

21

Creighton, Justice Scalia noted that when you do have

22

issues of fact involved, that you can have discovery

23

limited to the fact issue involved go forward.

24

would not be inconsistent with qualified immunity.

25

QUESTION:

And that

Well, who wrote the opinion in

Anderson?

Justice O'Connor?

2

MR. GLADDEN:

No.

Justice Scalia.

3

QUESTION:

4

And so, you think that Anderson requires what

Justice Scalia.

5

answer to my question?

6

MR. GLADDEN:

I think Anderson would suggest

7

that qualified immunity or not would -- there is no need

8

for a heightened pleading requirement or it would be

9

inconsistent to apply a heightened pleading requirement at

10

the same time that you said before that you could allow

11

discovery to go forward where qualified immunity has been

12

raised, only limited to the specific issue.

13

could eliminate this threat or exaggerated threat of over­

14

ranging and overbroad discovery.

15

QUESTION:

So, the discovery in a case would be

only limited to facts bearing on qualified immunity.

In the district courts -- well,

No.

But when I say a case like -Okay.

Yes, okay.

-- that, I meant one where there are

individuals involved who can claim qualified -MR. GLADDEN:

Oh, certainly.

I think that would

be in the district court's discretion, and certainly he

25

would have discretion to do so.

And I wouldn't be here to

1

argue to the contrary.
QUESTION:

2

Now, I take it - - maybe I'm wrong.

3

Is it correct that you're going to go on to say that

4

qualified immunity is not involved here?

5

MR. GLADDEN:

That's correct.

And as I pointed

6

out a moment ago, that issue -- Siegart v. Gilley I

7

believe was going to address that, and I recall your

8

concurring opinion.

9

Siegart v. Gilley, and that is not presented in this case

The Court didn't reach that issue in

10

although I recognize that the outcome of this case may

11

have some bearing on a subsequent case that would address

12

that issue.

13
14

QUESTION:

Is the municipality's claim here just

characterized as a defense?

15

MR. GLADDEN:

It's their position that the

16

heightened pleading requirement is a substantive form of

17

immunity.

18

believe --we think that Owen v. City of Independence

19

disposed of the issue of whether or not local governmental

20

entities are entitled to qualified immunity.

21

a cause of action to exist under section 1983, that

22

disposes of any absolute immunity.

23

We take the contrary position.

We don't

By allowing

And so, what we're talking about here is whether

24

or not the limitations on discovery should be addressed

25

through a limitation, like a rule 56(f) motion, whether or

not -- or rule 16 limitation on discovery at the summary

2

judgment stage, not at the initial pleading stage because

3

rule 8 expressly was intended to only provide fair notice

to defendants in these cases.

5

claim of not having notice, I don't think it's appropriate

6

to impose this pleading requirement, and in this case, no

7

one filed a motion for more definite statement because in

8

my view there was never any question about notice

9

involved.

10

QUESTION:

Unless there's a legitimate

Mr. Gladden, can I ask you, is there

11

-- what in the Federal rules, if anything -- and if your

12

theory is adopted -- would prevent a plaintiff routinely,

13

whenever there has been any malfeasance on the part of a

14

police officer, for example, to file a lawsuit claiming

15

that it is a policy of the city?

MR. GLADDEN:

18

QUESTION:

You know, the policeman

I think there's --

And you just file a complaint saying

19

this is a policy of the city and then it can't be

20

dismissed on the pleadings, so you get to the summary

judgment stage.

22

summary judgment.

23

know when you file the suit that you have a proper cause

of action, and you're using the suit as a means of

investigation, which doesn't seem to me is proper.

But you're entitled to discovery for

MR. GLADDEN:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. GLADDEN:

Okay, well --

What stops it?
Yes.

I'll respond to that by

4

saying, first of all, we do have rule 11, which imposes

5

upon plaintiff's counsel an obligation to make a

6

reasonable inquiry into a prefiling investigation into the

7

facts and law.
QUESTION:

8

9

Yes, but that only applies to the

facts that are asserted in the complaint, doesn't it?
MR. GLADDEN:

10

Well, it doesn't say that they

11

have to plead the facts, but it says they do have an

12

obligation to make a reasonable investigation into the

13

facts.

14
15

And -QUESTION:

I assume that means the facts

pleaded.
MR. GLADDEN:

16

Well, not necessarily.

You can

17

have someone fail to do a reasonable investigation and

18

have a boiler plate allegation like you have, or you could

19

have someone who had done a reasonable investigation.

20

threat of sanctions would foreclose some - QUESTION:

21

Do you have to find something in that

reasonable investigation?

investigation and I cannot identify any municipal policy,

but I still file the lawsuit.

MR. GLADDEN:

I don't think you would

necessarily have to find something, but you'd have to have

good reason to believe that discovery would bring forth

factual specifics to support your claim.

of litigation involved where the sanctions would not be

2

that enormous, and you would have to impose sanctions

3

limited to the specific event that caused, as the Court

4

has said in the rule 11 cases.

5

QUESTION:

What would the significance under

6

rule 11 be in a case in which the plaintiff did all the

7

prefiling investigation he could do and just couldn't find

8

out anything?

I think that's what you are saying happened

9

in this case.

And yet, based on the behavior of the

10

police officers, he thinks there's at least a reasonable

11

possibility that there was a policy of inadequate training

12

and so on.

13

generalized allegations and then hopes for discovery.

14

Would there be a rule 11 sanction imposable there?

15

So, he goes ahead and files based upon

MR. GLADDEN:

I don't think so.

I think if he

16

did everything reasonably -- every reasonable effort to

17

discover -- in this case, we had naturally an intelligence

18

organization, by the very name, who were very secretive of

19

the information they had in their files and elsewhere.

20

Rule 9(b), of course, does isolate two cases for mistake

21

and fraud, but you'd have to have particular allegations.

22

We think it's different in this case because in

23

fraud cases you're going to have a course of dealing and

24

you're going to have some reliance of the person who's the

25

victim of the fraud.

Mistake would be similar.

That's a

different category.

A case like this, you've got agents of a local

governmental entity who are causing damage to the victim

and then because we don't have respondeat superior, we've

got the supervisors or the policymaker somewhere else.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRETT A. RINGLE

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4

6

MR. RINGLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The respondents in this case, various

7

municipalities in Tarrant County, ask that the Fifth

8

Circuit's opinion -- judgment be affirmed, and that this

9

Court embrace a heightened pleading requirement in cases

10

arising under section 1983 against municipalities alleging

11

that officers have not been properly trained or what has

12

been known as failure to train cases.

13

This is especially critical in cases against

14

municipalities.

Until and unless there is a demonstration

15

of a municipal policy at issue, the case amounts to

16

nothing more than an allegation of vicarious liability for

17

which municipalities are not and have never been liable

18

either at the common law or under 1983.

19

consistently reaffirmed that proposition, having stated in

20

Monell that municipalities may not be sued under a theory

21

of respondeat superior.

This Court has

First, the plaintiff should be required to

This is not a case like Monell where all the

plaintiff should have to demonstrate is the presence of a

By definition, in a case like this, there is no policy

unless there is deliberate indifference.

a failure to train arises to the level of deliberate

It is only when

1983, has even been identified.

12

Secondly, the plaintiff should be required to

allegedly unconstitutional acts.

taught us in Oklahoma City v. Tuttle.

Similarly, a failure to train case at bottom is

requirement should be, we would get to whether it's

authorized at all under the rules in view of the plain

2

statement language in rule 8 and the fact that certainly

3

some sort of expressio unius argument derives from the

4

fraud and mistake special pleading requirement in rule 9.

5

I hope fairly soon in your argument, you will address

6

that, what I see as a kind of a preceding question to the

7

content of a heightened pleading requirement.

8

9

MR. RINGLE:

First, rule 8 has been represented

not in the terms that it's written.

I think the

10

petitioners want the Court to put the word notice as the

11

only requirement of rule 8.

12

requirement of giving factual notice.

13

notice of a claim.

14

of the facts that could conceivably be known are laid out

15

-- in essence, there is attached to the pleading, as an

16

exhibit, a videotape which contains every fact upon which

17

the claim is asserted -- rule 8 is still not met unless it

18

states a claim.

19

Rule 8 is more than a
Rule 8 requires

So, even if you have a case where all

24

indifference.

Rule 8 -QUESTION:

So, I think we take the case on the

7

assumption that it's the heightened pleading requirement

8

that's the defect in the pleading.

9

MR. RINGLE:

Yes, that's correct.

But the point

10

I'm making is for there to be a claim stated, under City

11

of Canton v. Harris, there has to be a policy present, and

12

unless there's some basis to suggest that there is

13

deliberate indifference, it doesn't even state a policy.

14

Deliberate indifference in a City of Canton v. Harris case

15

is part of the definition of a policy unlike in other

16

cases against municipalities.

17

And as -- rule 8 is not controlling in a

MR. RINGLE:

There is no question that this is

not and could not be an across-the-board rule, nor do I

suggest that it should be.

QUESTION:

The result --

Why is your client, which is a

MR. RINGLE:

I assure you I won't suggest that

the pattern requirement I'm suggesting has anything to do

with RICO as an analog either.

22

MR. RINGLE:

No.

Anderson --

Because Anderson and Creighton

assumes that before the resolution of the immunity issue,

there may be some discovery.

Does Anderson and Creighton,

11

therefore, imply that there is an abrogation of the

substantive immunity?

13

MR. RINGLE:

14

QUESTION:

No, I don't believe it does at all.
Well, if Anderson and Creighton

doesn't imply that, why would it be implied by a rule of

requires more than a plaintiff to just have done an

nothing, that plaintiff is then free to allege a cause of
