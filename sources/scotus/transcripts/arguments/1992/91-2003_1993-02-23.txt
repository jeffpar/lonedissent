ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This Federal common law action for money had and

12

received was brought by the United States to recover $11

13

million in public funds paid to the State of California as

14

taxes by the manager of the Naval Petroleum Reserve.

15

manager is a Federal contractor who operates under an

16

advance-funding, cost-reimbursement arrangement with the

17

United States.

18

The

The State taxes were assessed with respect to

19

purchases of personal property made by the manager in the

20

name of the United States.

21

that the taxes were erroneously and unlawfully assessed.

22

The courts below did not reach the question of

The United States contends

23

the legality of the State tax.

24

United States has a Federal common law right to recover

25

unlawful payments of State taxes, but they held that the

They acknowledged that the

1

Federal cause of action was inapplicable in this case

2

because the United States had not pursued administrative

3

tax refund procedures available under State law and had

4

not brought its judicial challenge to the State tax within

5

the 90 days provided by State law.
In our view, and in the unanimous view of six

6

7

other courts of appeals, the Federal common law right of

8

the United States to recover public funds that have been

9

unlawfully obtained is not subject to compliance with the

10

State procedures applicable to State law tax refund suits.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Jones, is -- should we make a

12

distinction in the kinds of unlawfulness that may be

13

appropriate predicates for that common law action?

14

There was nothing unlawful in the sense of being

15

either criminal or mistaken or tortious.

16

here, on your view, is simply an unlawfulness in the sense

17

that if the taxability issue were litigated as far as it

18

could be litigated on the merits, the United States would

19

win and California would not.

The unlawfulness

But should we distinguish between those two

20
21

senses of unlawful?

22

under the common law action?

23

MR. JONES:

And if we do, are you in trouble

Well, there is no basis, or

24

rationale even, for distinguishing in that sense, Justice

25

Souter.

was designed by this Court to protect the United States,

2

to prevent and remedy unlawful takings of public monies.

to state it is that under Federal common law, if Federal

funds have been taken without lawful justification, they

Our position is that the State tax law

QUESTION:

We would take the same

Well, Mr. Jones, who's the taxpayer

here?

17

MR. JONES:

Well, as California uses that term,

18

the taxpayer is the Federal manager of the Naval Petroleum

19

Reserve.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Who do you say is the taxpayer here?

You don't think the Government's the taxpayer, do you?
MR. JONES:

In - - there's two ways to answer

23

that; one is factually and the second is conceptually.

24

Factually, the court of appeals said, and was correct in

25

saying so, that these taxes were paid with Federal funds.

That's at page - QUESTION:

2

3

Well, Federal funds reimbursed the

contractor here.

4

MR. JONES:

Actually, it was something more than

5

that.

As you would see looking at page 142 of the joint

6

appendix, this is actually Federal funds that were paid

7

directly to the State.

8

funding arrangement of the type the Court discussed in the

9

United States v. New Mexico case.
QUESTION:

10

There was -- this is an advanced

These --

Well, in United States v. New Mexico

11

do you think we thought the United States was the

12

taxpayer?

13

MR. JONES:

I don't know if -- if that question,

14

framed that way, was before the Court.

15

in United States v. New Mexico was whether the immunity of

16

the United States from State taxes applied.

The -- we're not

We are not contending the tax is

unconstitutional.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. JONES:

Exactly.
However, as -- just to inform the

12

Court and not because it's instrumental in our argument,

13

the State's tax is shaped with constitutional constraints

14

in mind.

15

Federal contractors and applies to them differently than

16

it would to other types of contractors, and it does so to

17

meet the requirements of the Constitution.

18

The State has crafted a tax that applies only to

But our position is that the State tax is

unlawful as a matter of State law.

QUESTION:

That is another way

position of -- of being subrogated to whatever the right

as a matter of State law.
MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

Yeah.
And I acknowledge that there is a

bit of a chicken and an egg problem here.

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

is the State's

position.

4

6

Well that, of course,

Yeah.
And -- and it's a little glib to say

it, but nonetheless I think there's an element of truth;

10

it's a Federal chicken and a State egg, and under the

11

Supremacy Clause the chicken prevails.

12

the chicken is the common law right that this Court has

13

recognized in - - consistently,

14

anyone who takes Federal funds has to have a lawful

15

justification.

QUESTION:

And in our view,

that the United -- that

the tax was illegal under State law.

I don't think any of the cases that you rely

MR. JONES:

20

This is the first time this issue

21

has come to this Court, but it's been in the courts of

22

appeals for decades.

time this Court has had to decide whether a lawful

2

justification exists when the State has taken our funds

3

under an - - made an unlawful - - an illegal assessment of

4

our funds.

5
6

QUESTION:

Well, when your funds have been paid

to the State by your agent.

7

MR. JONES:

That is correct, and that was

8

exactly the context of the Bayne case in 1876, where a

9

Federal officer had Federal funds, he misappropriated

10

those funds and transmitted them to a third party.

11

Court allowed the United States to recover directly from

12

the third party the funds that had been unlawfully

13

obtained by that party.

14

This

Here too, the Court has to assume, on the record

15

of this case, that the State tax is unlawful, that the

16

State has -- has no lawful justification for the taking of

17

the funds.

18

QUESTION:

No, but we certainly cannot assume

19

that the funds were unlawfully taken from the United

20

States.

MR. JONES:

22

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
I mean in -- in the Bayne case the

funds were unlawfully taken by the Federal officer from

24

the United States, they were misappropriated, as I recall.

2

stands here.

3

MR. JONES:

Well, except that here the -- this

4

case falls with -- does fall within the confines of this

5

Court's prior decisions in that the funds were paid under

6

protest and under threat of penalty.

7

where the taxpayer voluntarily made the payment and then

8

came back years later and said by the way, I don't think I

9

should have been required to.

10

This is not a case

What the Court has held is that when - - when the

11

taxes have been paid under protest and under threat of

12

penalty, that it is not regarded as a voluntary payment

13

and that it can -- the Federal Government, the common law

14

action applies to recovery of the funds.

of State law, the taxpayer is required by law, as a

condition of receiving the refund, to pass the refund

through to the real party in interest.
QUESTION:

13

If -- if this case had proceeded with

14

the contractor's claim being adjudicated and there was a

15

final judgment in the California courts as to the

16

contractor and that judgment was in favor of the State,

17

adverse to the contractor, would you still have the right

18

to maintain this suit?

MR. JONES:

We would then have the problem that

just blew it, that's all.

9

MR. JONES:

Well, this case wasn't settled in

10

that respect below.

What was done in the State courts was

11

that the State acknowledged that a certain portion of its

12

taxes were improper; the remaining portion was still being

13

disputed.

14

The record reflects that the contractor then

15

advised the State that they had decided to dismiss the

16

contractor's claim and that the United States would then

17

commence a suit in Federal court.

18

appeals didn't seem to be aware of that.

MR. JONES:

We don't relitigate facts

Well, the court of appeals didn't

find anything on that.

It's just reading between the

5

lines, it seemed to be the tenor of the court's --

6

QUESTION:

7

without prejudice, wasn't it?

8

MR. JONES:

9

But it -- but it was dismissed

It was dismissed without prejudice

and at page 97 of the joint appendix there's a letter

10

between counsel that makes it quite clear that the State

11

was aware that the United States was going to pursue the

12

claim in Federal Court.

13
14

Claims of the United States involving public
funds inherently implicate an important national interest.

15

QUESTION:

Oh, let me just press one -- one more

16

question here.

On your theory that the United States is

17

the primary party here, do you think that the

18

California -- that the Federal contractor had standing to

19

proceed with its litigation in State court, claiming the

20

money?

1

MR. JONES:

Well, I believe there's -- there's

2

two separate causes of action.

3

a cause of action for the putative taxpayer, and allows

4

them standing to pursue it only in State court.

5

Court has recognized a Federal common law cause of action

6

for the United States, which we think is a separate cause

7

of action that, under 28 USC 1345, falls within the

8

plenary jurisdiction of this Court.

9

we are the real party at interest, that these were paid

California law recognizes

This

There is no dispute

10

with Federal funds; all of the elements of the Federal

11

common law cause of action have been met.

12

I would just like to take a minute to explain

13

what I think is the background of that action, although it

14

may be apparent by now.

15

Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Company case, even when

16

commercial transactions such as stock dividend payments

17

are involved, when the United States seeks to recover

18

public funds it is, quote, acting in its governmental

19

capacity as much as if it were collecting taxes.

20

As the Court held in the

The Court has thus consistently concluded, as it

21

stated in Clearfield Trust, that it is for the Federal

22

courts to fashion the rules governing the rights and

23

duties of the United States in its financial and

24

proprietary transactions.

1

in that situation, one rule for actions by the United

2

States against private parties who may have kind of

3

absconded with Government funds, as it appears to have

4

been the case in Bayne, and another rule where the State

5

is -- where the Government is simply protesting a

6

collection that has already been made by a State of taxes?

7

MR. JONES:

Well, the only orderly way in which

8

we can protest that collection is to subject ourselves to

9

the risk of penalties and compulsory process at State law,

10

or to bring -- to make the payment in an orderly fashion,

11

as this Court has - - has held in - - in the Courts I

12

cited -- in the cases I cited to Justice Souter.

13

QUESTION:

Well, did any of those involve

14

proceedings that involved the collection of State taxes as

15

opposed to private individuals?

16

MR. JONES:

Actually, the common law rule has

17

its roots in those two cases I cited that involve suits to

18

recover Federal taxes.

19

common law that individuals could recover Federal taxes

20

from the United States, even though they had been

21

voluntarily paid, because it was the orderly thing to do,

22

I suppose.

QUESTION:

This Court has held -- held at

Was there any other process for doing

so at that time?

that time, although I suppose that the taxpayer could have

2

resisted the assessment and not voluntarily --

3

QUESTION:

Well, could -- under the California

4

rule, you could not have intervened in the proceedings

5

that your contractor had instituted.

MR. JONES:

California cases seem to assume we

We could -- but we would --

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

They assume you could.
Yes.

They assume that we could

10

that question.

MR. JONES:

Yes.
We would be intervening in a

17

proceeding that would make the Federal claims subject to

18

State law procedures, to the State statute of limitations,

19

and to State court adjudication of the claim.

20

results are inconsistent with this Court's recognized need

21

for uniform rules to govern the claims of the United

22

States, in particular with 28 USC 2415, which provides a

23

6-year statute of limitations for claims by the United

24

States arising under contract, express or implied, in law.

which Congress has given the Federal courts plenary-

jurisdiction over claims by the United States.

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

Plenary and exclusive?
Well, exclusive through the removal

procedure -- not expressly, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but

7

pragmatically exclusive through the removal procedure.

8

The United States is entitled to have its claims

9

adjudicated in Federal Courts.

10
11

Congress has determined

that.
QUESTION:

But -- but when you talk about

12

removal, you're talking about the United States as a

13

defendant, then.

14

MR. JONES:

Well, the United States has -- has

15

the option in every case to have its claims heard in

16

Federal court.

17

United States to have its claims heard anywhere else.

18

No party has the option to require the

QUESTION:

Well, but what may be the rule as to

the United States as a defendant may be quite different

20

than the rule as the United States as a plaintiff.

21

22

someone claiming that the -- the Government owes it money,

Congress may quite likely have provided that the suit is

I don't see that says much about the legitimacy of the

MR. JONES:

Well, 28 USC 1345 gives the Federal

4

court jurisdiction over all, and that's the statutory

5

word, all causes of action, suits, or proceedings

6

commenced by the United States.

7

plenary a jurisdiction as Congress has provided.

8

obviously intended that the claims of the United States

9

would be adjudicatable or adjudicated in Federal courts.

It is as broad and
Congress

10

There is no basis under the Federal common law remedy for

11

requiring the Federal cause of action of the United States

12

to be adjudicated in State court.

13

I should make emphatic what I -- I said

14

indirectly about the statute of limitations.

15

has held on several occasions that the Federal claims of

16

the United States, and in particular the Federal common

17

law action for money had and received, is not subject to

18

State statutes of limitations.

19

a statute that expressly provides for every action for

20

money damages brought by the United States for contracts

21

implied at law to be given a 6-year Federal statute of

22

limitations.

23

The Court

In 1966, Congress enacted

The Federal statute of limitations applies

24

directly to the quasi-contractual claim of the United

25

States.

The statute legislatively fills the gap created

by this Court's decisions rejecting State law rules of

2

limitation for the Federal claims.
QUESTION:

3

Does that apply even if the United

4

States is subrogated to the claim and proceeds in a

5

subrogation capacity?
MR. JONES:

6

If the -- I take it the premise of

7

that question is there are two causes of action.

8

United States has its Federal cause of action; the United

9

States also, under the State's theory, could be subrogated

10

The

to the State law cause of action.
The answer to your question turns on the

11
12

character of the State statute of limitations, at least

13

that's what the Ninth Circuit has held in a series of

14

cases not at issue here today.

15

suggested that when the State statute incorporates the

16

limitations period as an element of the cause of action,

17

then compliance with the State statute of limitations is

18

necessary to give rise to the cause of action.

The Ninth Circuit has

We think it apparent -- although that issue

19
20

isn't presented here, we think it apparent that this State

21

statute of limitations does not incorporate compliance

22

with the State period as an element of the cause of

23

action.

24

limitations says is that failure to bring suit within 90

25

days will be deemed to constitute a waiver of the State

To the contrary, what the State statute of

1

claim, so it is a traditional or more traditional State

2

statute of limitations.

3

So the short answer to your question is if we

4

had proceeded under State law, we would not be subject to

5

the State statute of limitations, the 6-year Federal

6

statute of limitations would apply, but the case hasn't

7

been presented on that basis in the lower courts.
The State's argument takes a somewhat different

8

9

tack.

They don't join the contention that we should be

10

required to exhaust a nonexisting remedy.

11

contend that we should be required to resort to the State

12

process.

13

conflicts with well established rules requiring Federal

14

rules to govern Federal actions.

15

They instead

For the reasons I've already described, that

But I should also point out that it would make

16

the public right of the United States to recover public

17

funds turn on the perseverance of Federal contractors who

18

ultimately have no stake in the outcome, and who operate

19

under an enormous variety of tax procedures in literally

20

thousands of local taxing jurisdictions.

21

In Clearfield Trust the Court concluded that

22

because United States transactions proceed upon such a

23

vast scale, the Federal right should not be subjected to

24

the exceptional uncertainties imposed by the vagaries of

25

the State law rules.

I mean they have less money than the United States.

I don't understand why that is such a big imposition.

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

I think the Court has -The United States is -- is claiming

7

exemptions, or whatever, under State laws, to follow those

8

procedures.

9

MR. JONES:

I think the Court has recognized

10

that the claims of the United States differ both in

11

quality and quantity in that respect.

12

as the sovereign, should not be subjected to State law

13

rules that limit Federal rights.

at it from that perspective.

QUESTION:

But the so-called Federal right here

is simply a claim under California law.

It is a claim that the State has

taken money without lawful justification.

lies entirely in California State tax law, doesn't it?
MR. JONES:

I would put it the other way.

I

would state -- say that the basis for the State's defense,

5

the basis for the State's assertion that, in fact, it took

6

the monies lawfully, lies in its claim under State law.

7

That is a claim that we - - we disagree with and that the

8

Court, for purposes of this case, must assume is

9

incorrect.

10

For purposes of this case, the Court must

assume the State tax is unlawful and that - QUESTION:

Well who -- who'd better decide that

whether a California State tax is unlawful or not,

MR. JONES:

There's no question that the Federal

You're asking us here to extend

And it seems to me that you've

10

-- you've got to answer questions like which would be the

11

preferable court system to decide the question, just as a

12

matter of policy since the prior cases don't support what

13

you're seeking to do here.

14

MR. JONES:

Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, we

15

think the case -- this Court's cases do support it.

And

16

as a matter of -- and as a policy matter -- the two policy

17

sources that I can refer the Court to - - this Court has

18

plenary jurisdiction over claims of the United States; it

19

doesn't have that kind of jurisdiction for anyone else.
And secondly, the Anti-Injunction Act does not

MR. JONES:

2

In that event, I suppose the

this Court has to assume there was no lawful

that in the Board of County Commissioners case the Court

emphasized that nothing -- and I think I quoting --

nothing that the State can do will be allowed to destroy

the Federal right, which is to be vindicated.

point is that we should be allowed to determine our

California's position is that this Court's answer should

10

be consistent with the long line of authority, from Dows

V. City of Chicago in 1870 to Fair Assessment in Real

12

Estate v. McNary in 1981, that the Federal Government

13

cannot invoke equitable remedies, at least against a State

MR. MILAM:

1

The Department of Employment case

2

was a case that refused to apply the Tax Injunction Act as

3

to State taxes because a Federal instrumentality was being

4

taxed in violation of its sovereign immunity.

5

does not apply in this case because WBEC was not a Federal

6

instrumentality and there's no issue of sovereign

7

immunity.

8

9

That rule

Indeed, if you take the facts of the Department
of Employment case and take away the Supremacy Clause

10

issue in that case and substitute in its place the

11

principle of comity, because tax --

12

involved, it's California's position that even Federal

13

instrumentalities must be required to pursue State

14

remedies before seeking relief in the Federal courts.

15

State tax law was

There are three cases at least, and maybe more,

16

that -- I've put down -- I've put three cases that the

17

United States has cited that fall into this category.

18

United States v. Benton, United States v. Broward County,

19

and United States v. DeKalb County all involve issues of

20

application of tax -- State tax law only and there are no

Supremacy Clause issues.

2

Those are the ones on the

Government's brief page 20, I think, yeah, yeah.

3

MR. MILAM:

So California's answer to the

4

question presented by the United States is that assuming

5

it had -- just assuming for purpose of argument that it

6

can state a quasi-contract cause of action, when the issue

7

is one of application of State tax law only and there are

8

no Supremacy Clause issues, pursuit -- effective pursuit

9

of State remedies is required before the access to Federal

10

Courts, and this includes meeting all the procedural

11

requirements of State law.
QUESTION:

12

Why is that?

I don't understand.

I

13

mean I can understand the other basis for the result you

14

want, namely the basis that -- where the United States is

15

just subrogated to a -- to a claim of someone else.

16

that someone else has no right to ignore the State

17

procedures, neither does the United States; that makes

sense to me.

MR. MILAM:

The second reason that the United States has no

15

notice of denial of the claim for refund.

16

And like this Court's

WBEC did go through this procedure.

Notice of

17

denials were made and it filed suit within 90 days.

18

However, because it's a part of the California accrual of

19

a cause of action under a waiver of sovereign immunity,

20

once the dismissals were made WBEC's actions -- claim

21

against the State of California were extinguished by

22

operation of law when the dismissals were made.

23

The Ninth Circuit said that a dismissal means

24

those cases were never filed, and if the WBEC cases were

25

never filed no case was filed within the 90 days of the

notice of denial of WBEC's claim for refund.

So the

United States can make no claim against California either

3

as a taxpayer, because it did not file a claim for refund,

4

or as a subrogee of WBEC.

accepted is whether invoking - - in invoking the Federal

I mean the question we'd

10

States must comply with the State law requirements.

11

you do that when you're a subrogee?

12

MR. MILAM:

Can

I don't -- in this case I don't

13

believe so because WBEC had no such action and a subrogee

14

just takes the remedies of the subrogor.

15

So the United States reliance on the Summerlin

16

case is misplaced because it fails to distinguish between

17

a statute -- State statute of limitations depriving the

18

United States of a preexisting valid claim and the

19

conditions precedent to an accrual of a cause of action

20

under a waiver of sovereign immunity.

21

The first question for Summerlin and Summerlin

22

analysis is is there a valid cause of action.

23

no valid cause of action, then you never get to the second

24

element of Summerlin, the deprival -- depriving of the

25

United States of a cause of -- of a claim.

the State court actions that WBEC filed the United States

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

12

Excuse me.

Federal -- Federal

13

common law has been applied to actions brought by the

14

United States to recover States taxes.

15

first case of this type.

16

was a suit by the United States to recover taxes paid to

17

the State of Kansas.

18

QUESTION:

This is not the

Board of County Commissioners

I just -But there the only question this

19

Court decided was whether interest would be available,

20

wasn't it?

21

MR. JONES:

It's the only question the Court

22

decided, but it's not the only question the Court

23

discussed and addressed.

24

that Federal common law creates the remedy and - - and

25

governs the choice of the -- of the rules to apply.

The Court specified the fact

QUESTION:

2

But nobody was arguing otherwise in

that case.

3

MR. JONES:

4

don't know, I wasn't up there.

5

QUESTION:

I -- I assume that's correct, but I

Well, I mean judge -- I don't claim

6

to have been present at the argument.

7

from the opinion it doesn't appear that anyone was arguing

8

otherwise.

9

MR. JONES:

I'm just saying

Well, the opinion discusses the

10

issues as if they were relevant to its decision, and so I

11

assume that those issues were discussed before the Court.

12

But as far -- I'm just being honest -- in terms of what

13

was actually presented to the Court, I'm -- I'm not

14

certain.

15

The second point is that common - - at common

16

law, at -- the exhaustion of remedies was not required.

17

The City of Philadelphia v. Collector, this Court's

18

decision specifically rejected a suggestion that the

19

Federal remedy should not be available because there was

20

an administrative procedure not exhausted.

21

there was no support for that proposition.
