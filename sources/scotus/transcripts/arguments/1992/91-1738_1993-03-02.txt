CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 91-1738, Jerry Gilmore v. Kevin Taylor.
Mr. Wilson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK E. WILSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WILSON:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a habeas corpus case.

10

Kevin Taylor's

11

murder conviction became final almost 6 years ago, and he

12

now asks this Court to upset his final conviction because

13

he says a State law jury instruction error at his trial

14

also violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth

15

Amendment.

16

The due process right that Taylor invokes in

17

this Court is a right to present a defense.

As he

18

characterizes that right, it makes no difference whether

19

or not the defense relates in any way to the elements of

20

the charged crime.

21

Now, the issue in this case, of course, is not

22

whether or not Taylor's theory of due process is correct

23

or whether it is incorrect.

24

Seventh Circuit misapplied Teague v. Lane below.

25

the Court reaffirmed just a few weeks ago in Graham v.

The only issue is whether the

And as

1

Collins, the question under Teague is whether a reasonable

2

State court could have rejected that due process theory at

3

the time the conviction became final.

4

Illinois believes that it was quite reasonable

5

in 1987, as it is to this day, to believe that the right

6

to present a defense is not nearly as expansive as Taylor

7

describes it and that, therefore, this conviction did not,

8

in fact, violate the Due Process Clause.

9

Illinois asks the Court to reverse Kevin Taylor's

10
11

Accordingly,

conviction.
Now, as I mentioned, the question presented is

12

whether Taylor invokes a new rule by claiming that his

13

jury instructions violated his right to present a defense.

14

I wish to first to - - I wish to first discuss the Teague

15

new rule standard and then the reasonableness of Illinois'

16

position that these instructions did not violate the

17

Constitution.

18

If a State court decision --

19

QUESTION:

May I just clarify one thing?

You

20

say you're going to argue that the instructions did not

21

violate the Constitution?

22

MR. WILSON:

I'm going to argue that Illinois'

23

belief that the instructions do not violate the

24

Constitution is reasonable under Teague.

QUESTION:

But you acknowledged in the court of

MR. WILSON:

that there was a

factual matter,

6

the reasonableness inquiry of Teague v.

And Stringer v. Black I think is a good example

7

of a case where the Court said that a - - an argument was

8

unreasonable presented by the State, and that therefore

9

the conviction actually did violate the Constitution.

10
11

And

the Court only addressed a Teague issue.
Saffle v. Parks.

The only issue was whether the

12

Teague new rule standard was met, and the Court said that

13

the argument presented by the habeas petition was

14

unreasonable.

15

is wrapped up within the merits itself.

16

So, the reasonableness of a -- an argument

QUESTION:

At the time that the State argued

17

this case in the Seventh Circuit, was there an outstanding

18

Seventh Circuit case where it - - had Falconer been decided

19

so that the constitutional question was not open in the

20

Seventh Circuit?

21

MR. WILSON:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And

22

Illinois contested the -- Illinois argued in many cases

23

that these instructions were,

24

in fact, we argued in a series of cases the precise

25

argument that we present to this Court as to why our

1

argument is reasonable.

2

it in so many cases, we didn't press it any further after

3

getting some strong language by the Seventh Circuit.

4

QUESTION:

But the Seventh Circuit rejected

When you argued that they were

5

constitutional, did you also argue that they were

6

substantively correct as a matter of criminal law, or did

7

you concede that they were - - that they misstated the

8

burden of proof, but that it was just not

9

unconstitutional?
MR. WILSON:

10

We conceded only that the Reddick

11

decision, which was the Illinois Supreme Court decision

12

that rejected these instructions under State law -- we

13

conceded that, given Reddick, the instructions were

14

invalid under State law.

15

the instructions before the Illinois Supreme Court, but

16

then it was an issue of State law after the Supreme Court

17

of Illinois decided that case.

18

QUESTION:

We certainly argued in favor of

But Judge Flaum said that the State

19

challenges neither the vitality of Reddick nor Falconer.

20

So, I gather you did not challenge Falconer in the Seventh

21

Circuit.

22

23

MR. WILSON:

We didn't challenge Falconer, no.

We challenged --we only argued Teague --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. WILSON:

You only argued the Teague point.
We argued Teague.

The constitutionality of these instructions,

1
2

Your Honors, was susceptible to debate among reasonable

3

minds in 1987.

4

QUESTION:

Excuse me, but you've left me with a

5

little confusion.

In arguing Teague, you are arguing that

6

Falconer could reasonably have come out the other way.

7

MR. WILSON:

8

I would suggest to the Court three reasons why

9
10

That's correct, Your Honor.

these -- the constitutionality of the instructions was
susceptible to debate.
First of all, these were pattern jury

11
12

instructions.

13

before the Illinois Supreme Court struck them down under

14

State law, and it took 22 years before the Seventh Circuit

15

declared them unconstitutional under the Due Process

16

Clause.

17

Illinois had invalidated them before then either.

18
19
20

They had been in existence for 20 years

And, for that matter, no other appellate court in

QUESTION:

Can you summarize very briefly the

reasoning of the Seventh Circuit's decision in Falconer?
MR. WILSON:

Well, Your Honor, I believe that

21

the decision in Falconer is confusing, and in fact, it

22

confused the Seventh Circuit in a series of cases after -

23

- thereafter.

24
25

Parts of the Falconer decision suggest that the
court believed that the instructions violated In re

1

Winship because of a burden of proof problem, and parts of

2

Falconer suggest that the instructions effectively remove

3

a defense from a defendant.

4

The Seventh Circuit, after it recognized that

5

just because there was a burden of proof problem with

6

relation to an affirmative defense -- after it realized

7

that that really would not violate Winship, they

8

essentially withdrew that part of the reasoning of

9

Falconer.
The pattern instructions were written by a

10
11

pattern instruction committee established by the Illinois

12

Supreme Court composed of law professors, judges, and

13

practitioners.

14

upon hundreds of cases, in the cases dealing with the most

15

serious crime in Illinois, murder.

16

unlikely that these instructions were so obviously

17

unconstitutional as to survive the Teague new rule

18

standard, but at the same time no member of the criminal

19

defense bar of the State of Illinois could convince a --

20

an appellate court of the unconstitutionality of the

21

instructions for over 2 decades.

The instructions were used in hundreds

And it seems extremely

If there were any case from this Court --

1

which was an Illinois appellate court decision referred to

2

in the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in People v.

3

Flowers, as an example of how the Illinois appellate

4

courts had been faced with constitutional challenges in

5

the past, but had affirmed the constitutionality even

6

given the precise argument that Taylor makes here, that

7

essentially the instructions were wrong because they

8

didn't clarify to the jury that it had to find the

9

defendant not guilty of manslaughter before it found him

10

guilty of murder.

11

and over again and that was why the Illinois Supreme Court

12

said, well, if these are unconstitutional, they're

13

unconstitutional under a new rule because no one knew why

there were unconstitutional until -QUESTION:

Do you have the citation of People

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

19

I don't think you cite it in your

It wasn't cited in the brief, and I mention it

MR. WILSON:

In hindsight, Your Honor, I would

have included - -

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. WILSON:

Is that the only case?
That's the only case that I know of

5

that specifically addressed a constitutional challenge,

6

although the instructions were challenged in other cases,

7

and I believe --

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, have they been challenged on

State law grounds?

10

MR. WILSON:

Yes.

11

We did cite in our brief the series of cases

12

after Reddick which disputed whether or not the

13

instructions were constitutional.

14

QUESTION:

That --

You really couldn't grapple with the

15

constitutional question until you grappled with the State

16

law question, could you?

17

challenge would have been hard to mount before Reddick,

18

wouldn't it?

19

MR. WILSON:

I mean, the constitutional

I certainly believe that's right,

20

Your Honor, because that is part and parcel of our

21

argument that this is essentially a State law problem.

22

People v. Flowers, as I mentioned, was where the

23

Illinois Supreme Court adopted Teague for purposes of

24

State collateral review and found that these instructions

25

were only unconstitutional under a new rule.

The court I

1

think applied a very straightforward application of Teague

2

v. Lane.

3

Teague, predictability in the constitutional law, finality

4

of State court judgments, that these pattern instructions

5

couldn't violate the Constitution except by virtue of a

6

new rule given that it upset an established State practice

7

in Illinois.
A second reason, beyond the fact that these were

8

9

It said based on the principles underlying

pattern instructions, as to why these -- the

10

constitutionality of these instructions was susceptible to

11

debate is the line of Connecticut Supreme Court cases that

12

we cited in our reply brief in response to citations by

13

Taylor.

14

In that line of cases, the Connecticut Supreme

15

Court, in a situation completely removed from this

16

Illinois problem, of course, and in a completely different

17

context, came to the same conclusion under the Due Process

18

Clause that we are asserting in our case, and that is that

19

the right to present a defense extends to elements of

20

crimes, but not to affirmative defenses.

21

not the Court would agree with that in a case on direct

22

appeal, the fact of the matter is there was good reason to

23

believe that was the law in the mid '80's and nothing

24

since then has changed that.

constitutionality of these instructions.

One judge below

2

does not believe that these instructions are

unconstitutional.

4

Cole v. Young case and in the Flowers case, Judge

5

Easterbrook presented cogent arguments as to why there is

this area, and he believes that one fair way to

rationalize the cases is to say that instructions like

Taylor essentially asks this Court to declare

that the unanimous Connecticut Supreme Court and the

16

that this Court would radically transform the Teague new

the right to present a defense case -- line of cases that

Taylor relies upon are far too removed factually from the

facts of this case to dictate the result that he sees.

Illinois believes

It is quite true that there is a line of cases

affirmative defenses.

2

Engle v. Isaac is the most important case in

3

this regard.

In that case,

the instruction to the jury -

4

-instructions -- required the defendant to prove by a

5

preponderance of the evidence that he acted in self-

6

defense.

7

law because under State law, the instructions should have

8

told the government to disprove self-defense beyond a

The instructions were patently wrong under State

reasonable doubt, and the court held that the instructions
10

did not violate the Due Process Clause simply because they

11

related to an affirmative defense.
It would have been perfectly reasonable for an

12

13

Illinois court --an Illinois judge to pick up Engle v.

14

Isaac and say, well,

15

decided that affirmative defense jury instruction errors

16

don't violate the Constitution, but jury instruction

17

errors under -- in elements cases would.

it seems like the Supreme Court has

MR. WILSON:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

that is certainly an arguable distinction.
The problem with that distinction,

though,

is

24

that the error could well have been exactly the same.

unfairness to the defendant could just have been just the

(800) FOR DEPO

The

1

same in Engle as it was here, and the court's reasoning

2

does not suggest that that distinction makes a difference

3

in its reasoning.

4

well, these instructions are unfair because the burden of

5

proof is wrong, would have considered the most serious

6

error -- the most serious unfairness to a defendant, and

7

said, well, even in that case it still doesn't violate the

8

Constitution.

9

Presumably the court would have said,

It's still not fundamentally unfair.

Whether or not that is true, of course --

10

whether or not the court would, in fact, hold that isn't

11

really the question.

12

could have read it that way, and courts had read it that

13

way, in fact.

14

in Cole v. Young is a good example of how --

And I think Judge Easterbrook's discussion

QUESTION:

15

The question is whether a judge

Is it important or critical here that

16

the defendant did not object to the instructions at the

17

time?

18

MR. WILSON:

Well, the fact that the defendant

19

didn't object in a way makes it hard to apply the Teague

20

v. Lane standard because you don't -- because there was

21

actually, in fact, no decision on the merits issue.

22

it would be a strange rule, indeed, if the fact that the

23

defendant didn't object could somehow get the defendant

24

beyond the Teague new rule standard once it gets to habeas

25

corpus.

But

1

I think -- and, in fact, I would point, Justice

2

O'Connor, to Stringer v. Black as a case where the habeas

3

petitioner had procedurally defaulted in the State courts.

4

That was in the recitation of facts in Stringer, but the

5

court still addressed the Teague new rule standard.

6

the court has in the past faced a situation like this and

7

has addressed the Teague new rule standard anyway.

8

So,

This case, therefore, is very similar to Butler

9

v. McKellar because in that case, the issue was whether

10

Roberson v. Arizona was dictated by Edwards v. Arizona,

11

and the court held no, it wasn't dictated because the

12

result of Roberson was subject to dispute at the time.

13

And the court pointed to the dissents within the court

14

itself as to the outcome of Roberson.

15

fact that there was a circuit dispute before Roberson was

16

decided on that issue, and the same can be said here.

17

There were judges, perfectly reasonable judges, who had

18

reached opposite conclusions in the past, and it was --

19

thus, the result was susceptible to debate among

20

reasonable minds.

21

It pointed to the

And in sum, Your Honors, the Due Process Clause

22

permits a certain level of serious error in State jury

23

instructions before the Due Process Clause requires the

24

court to strike them down as unconstitutional.

QUESTION:

How much?

What's the line?

At what

point is there too much error?

something which, if it had been State law, would be

constitutional?

4

MR. WILSON:

So long as the error says

Well, we believe that the court has

5

suggested that the line should be drawn at elements versus

6

affirmative defenses.

And if the State decides to charge

criminal protection from the Bill of Rights.
But if the State decides to permit a defendant

11
12

to plead and prove something that would mitigate his

13

punishment, and if the Constitution doesn't require that

14

affirmative defense in this case -- or perhaps it would be

15

an aggravating factor or mitigating factor in the

16

noncapital case.

17

those things in the first place, it's hard to see what the

18

difference between Federal constitutional law and State

19

law would be if the Court were to accept Kevin Taylor's

20

argument.

If the Constitution doesn't require

QUESTION:

21

Let me be sure I understand your

point.

Supposing there is an affirmative defense of self-

Constitution doesn't require, but the State law

authorizes.

correctly, that the court could properly instruct the jury

2

not to consider self-defense and not violate the

3

Constitution even though it's flatly in violation of State

4

law?

5

MR. WILSON:

If the court were -- Your Honor, I

6

believe that the court has almost addressed that question

7

already in Engle v. Isaac because the instructions may

well have prevented the jury from considering selfdefense .

12

MR. WILSON:

And I would simply emphasize that we are talking

That's correct.

You do.

about Teague here, not a merits complaint.
Given the fact that there's no case directly on

16

point and given the fact that there are mixed signals

17

coming from the case law in this area, Illinois submits

18

that the constitutionality of the instructions was

MR. MARSHALL:

2

Chief Justice, Your Honors, may

it please the Court:

3

At the outset, it's imperative to distinguish

4

between two different issues that are floating around in

5

this case.

6

On the one hand, there's the issue in Reddick in

7

which the Illinois Supreme Court held, as a purely matter

8

of State law, that Illinois must bear the burden of

9

negating the affirmative defense of provocation.

We do

10

not rely in any sense on that right, and we concede that

11

there was, in fact, a great deal of confusion prior to

12

Reddick about that.
Now, the State has cited People v. March for the

13
14

first time at this stage, and it's somewhat difficult to

15

prepare a response to a case that's not cited in the

16

briefs.

17

refers to demonstrates exactly this point.

18

Flowers says prior to this Court's ruling that the State

19

has the burden to negate the voluntary manslaughter mental

20

states, at least one panel had ruled that the State did

21

not bear this burden.

voluntary manslaughter.

He asks only for the opportunity

2

to demonstrate that to the jury.

3

-- every single court -- that has been faced with these

4

instructions has concluded that they were reasonably

5

likely to lead the jury to believe that it should totally

6

ignore the affirmative defense, wholly notwithstanding the

7

question of who bears the burden, that the jury would read

8

these instructions, go into the jury room, and say we've

9

been told if he killed with the requisite intent, he's

Yet, every single court

11

because they were never told to proceed to then discuss

12

the issue of whether any affirmative defense applied.

QUESTION:

It's over

Your claim, Mr. Marshall, does not

14

then relate to the inability to adduce evidence at trial,

15

but to the instructions that the jury was given for

16

considering that evidence.

17

MR. MARSHALL:

That's right, Your Honor, but the

18

ability to adduce evidence is, of course, simply a means

19

to an end of having the jury consider that evidence, and

20

this Court has held that on numerous occasions.

say comes the closest to supporting the Seventh Circuit's

decision in this case?

MR. MARSHALL:

Of course,

2

the trial judge didn't say that even in this case.

3

were three counts, murder, invasion of the home, and

manslaughter, and the jury came back and its verdict said,

5

number one, invasion of the home, number two, murder,

6

which indicates to me that they did proceed from the

7

bottom up.

There

We'll -- I'll take your case on the assumption

8

that you give it to us, but I just point out that that is
10

something of a stretch from what, in fact, happened at

11

this trial.
MR. MARSHALL:

12

Your Honor, I'm not sure it's

13

such a stretch, and I refer the Court to pages 13

and

14

140, the last two pages of the joint appendix, where

15

although the court -- the jury had signed the verdicts on

16

murder and on home invasion, it totally left the verdicts

17

blank with reference to voluntary manslaughter.
Now, if the jury had looked at voluntary

18
1

manslaughter and decided, hmm, we don't think he acted

20

under sudden and intense passion, then most certainly they

21

would have had to find him, under the instruction, not

manslaughter.

So, to the extent that we know anything

2

about this jury, what we know from the forms is that

3

apparently the jury did, in fact, ignore that.

4

And again, the State has conceded that there's a

5

reasonable likelihood under the appropriate test that this

6

jury convicted Kevin Taylor and never considered his

7

defenses.

8

10

The State's only claim is - QUESTION:

In Boyde v. California, the Court dealt

21

with a methodology of examining instructions and said what

do we do with instructions where it's not clear how the

1

a jury have gone in and not considered the defense at all?
So, we're dealing here with the question of

2

3

might a jury have totally ignored.

This is a statistical

4

question about a jury totally ignoring, not a question

5

about, well, how much did the jury ignore.

6

instruction is read in the way that the Seventh Circuit,

7

the district court, the Illinois Supreme Court read it, we

8

are dealing with a reasonable likelihood, which is the

9

test for examining instructions, that the jury went back

If the

10

at 3:50 p.m., got the instructions 15 or 20 minutes later,

11

and then within the hour came back without ever thinking

12

that it was supposed to look at the question of whether

13

Kevin Taylor's affirmative defense was satisfied.

14

could any reasonable jurist in 1987 think that that

15

comported with due process?

Now,

The State's only argument is that it didn't know

16
17

that affirmative defenses were subject.

18

the trial judge could give affirmative defense

19

instructions in Portuguese, knowing full well that the

20

jury didn't understand them, but that the Federal

21

Constitution would have nothing to say about that, Your

22

Honors.

of State law.

to make certain aspects elements of offenses.

2

according to the State, not only would affirmative

3

defenses be immune, but elements too should be immune

4

unless they're that somehow -- and Justice Scalia was

5

referring to judgment calls -- somehow part of this notion

6

of core elements that the Constitution requires a State to

7

make part of its criminal law.

8

methodology this Court has used since Goldberg v. Kelly

9

and well before that in adjudicating the issue of due

10
11

So,

That is not the

process.
As Justice White wrote in 1985 -- and it wasn't

12

new in '85, and it certainly wasn't new in '87 -- if a

13

clearer statement is needed, we provide it today.

14

that's ironic language in view of the Teague v. Lane issue

15

which looks to clear statements.

And

16

The State's argument that it didn't know that

17

due process applied to affirmative defenses is about as

18

persuasive as an argument that it didn't know in 1987 that

19

the First Amendment applied to the States.

22

QUESTION:

You think Engle against Isaac bears

on this case somewhat?
MR. MARSHALL:

Engle v. Isaac was a case where the defendant

claimed or the petitioner for habeas corpus, I should say,

claimed that he had a right to have the State negate the

5

that the substantive entitlement to an affirmative defense

12

State law creates entitlements in the criminal law through

elements and affirmative defenses, as it does in the civil

law.

Substance

On the other hand, the mere fact that the State

16

adds an additional procedure and goes beyond what due

process would require as a matter of Federal process does

18

not mean that procedures then become sort of piggy-backed

on to where every State procedure now becomes a

First of all, the State has, throughout its

12

out there, and I really don't know where that figure comes

13

from.

were promulgated for the very first time in 1981.

15

to 1981, the instructions were rather clear in

16

articulating the difference between the affirmative

17

defense and the elements of the offense vis-a-vis murder.

18

These instructions, these pattern instructions,

MR. WILSON:

Your Honors, Mr. Chief Justice, I

don't want to take up much of the Court's time.

11

I can offer a reason as to why the criminal

defense bar didn't raise this particular challenge to

13

these instructions over those 22 years.

14

And, by the way, it was 22 years.

As Judge

15

Easterbrook's opinion in Flowers makes clear, the change

16

in 1981, which counsel points to was -- excluded an

17

instruction that combined the murder and voluntary

18

manslaughter instructions into one separate instruction,

19

the pattern instructions.

20

before that time, people still -- judges still used the

21

instructions in a way that would create this very problem,

22

and Mr. Flowers' case was a good example of that because

23

he was convicted before the 1991 instructions came out.

that all of the Illinois cases show the reason, and that

2

is that the closest cases on point from this Court are

3

Mullaney v. Wilbur, Patterson v. New York, and the other

4

burden of proof cases because everyone thought that at

5

most this was a burden of proof problem, and that was - -

6

those are the cases closest on point.

7

The reason this argument was never presented to

a court was because no criminal defense lawyer could find

a case that was close enough on point, and no one thought

they would win.

If you look at Penry v. Lynaugh, for example,

QUESTION:

And so, there are dozens of cases

that have refused to follow Reddick because of the

MR. WILSON:

Absolutely, and that, as pointed

out by Judge Easterbrook, I think it's quite a fair

comment that here we have a Federal court effectively

saying that even though the Illinois Supreme Court decided

10

to clean up a jury instruction problem, we're going to

11

grant all these people new trials even if the Illinois

12

Supreme Court doesn't think we should.

13

MR. WILSON:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

because Winship has been limited to elements of offenses

in many different contexts.

asking the court -- saying that that element/nonelement

distinction should be applied in one more context.

wasn't changing Winship.

He was applying it.

14

I do believe that counsel's argument, Kevin

pointed out.

17

of State law is going to violate the Constitution because

from Estelle v. McGuire.

that these jury instructions violated the California

A serious

jury instruction error may deprive someone of their right
to counsel.

It may deprive someone of their right to

testify in their own behalf.

The fact of the matter is

that happens, and unless the Court is willing to say that
States -- the Due Process Clause requires perfect trials,
that cannot be a rule of due process.
The last point I make, Your Honor, is that if a
judge instructs a jury in Portuguese on an affirmative
defense, what would happen is the judge could be
challenged most likely for bias against that defendant.

I

don't think the challenge would depend on some particular
analysis of affirmative defenses versus elements.
