CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in 92-166, Keene Corporation v. The United States.
Mr. Taranto.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. TARANTO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the meaning of 28 U.S.C.

11

section 1500, which says that the Court of Federal Claims

12

shall not have jurisdiction over a claim against the

13

United States if the plaintiff has pending in another

14

court another case against the Government or its agents

15

for or in respect to that claim.

16

The Federal circuit, expressly repudiating long-

17

settled precedent, held that section 1500 automatically

18

requires dismissal whenever the plaintiff had pending

19

sometime during its suit another action growing out of the

20

same transaction or operative facts.

21

QUESTION:

When you say, repudiating longÂ­

22

standing precedent, Mr. Taranto, you mean Federal circuit

23

or Court of Claims precedent, right?

24
25

MR. TARANTO:

Yes.

Yes, that's right, and it

required dismissal even if the actions had to be pursued

separately, and even if the other action is over.
Based on this new rule, petitioner came and had

2

3

its cases dismissed after 10 years of pretrial proceedings

4

were completed.

5

based on the Government's sale of asbestos, its

6

requirement of asbestos in products it's purchased, and

7

its manner of operating shipyards.
Our position is that the Federal circuit

8

9
10

Denying Keene a hearing on its claims

misconstrued section 1500 in two respects, and that two
longstanding constructions of 1500 should be reinstated.
First, two suits are not for or in respect to

11
12

the same claim where Congress has insisted that the claims

13

in the two suits are different by demanding that they must

14

be brought separately, and second, by its plain terms, the

15

statute does not apply after the plaintiff no longer has

16

pending any other suit.

17

Now, on the first position, I want to make four

18

points.

The first is that it was settled law in the Court

19

of Claims and the Federal circuit, two of the only courts,

20

aside from this Court, that could ever address this

21

question, for more than a quarter of a century, that when

22

Congress has declared that two separate rights of action

23

must be litigated in two different courts, the court

24

should not turn around and read 1500 as saying that the

25

two suits are really for and in respect to the same claim.

QUESTION:

1

On what general principle of law do

2

you base this argument, Mr. Taranto?

3

ordinarily review Court of Claims or Federal circuit

4

precedent.

5

MR. TARANTO:

No.

I mean, we don't

I think that -- well, stare

6

decisis in its strict terms perhaps applies only to this

7

Court's review of its own precedent.

8

because stare decisis is a policy-based doctrine the

9

same - QUESTION:

10

Nevertheless,

We wouldn't take a case here, I don't

11

think, to hear it argued that the Ninth Circuit had failed

12

to follow stare decisis in connection with a Ninth Circuit

13

precedent.

14

MR. TARANTO:

No, I think that's right, but

15

this, I think, presents two unique circumstances.

16

that the issue of 1500's interpretation is unique to the

17

Federal circuit.

18

and as a consequence, all of the reliant's interest both

19

of litigants like Keene and of Congress in legislating in

20

the area, must necessarily look to established law in that

21

circuit to guide litigants and guide Congress, and it's

22

for that reason that we think that cases like the Casman

23

line of cases demand special respect.

24

the court of appeals just had it wrong.
MR. TARANTO:

2

Yes, I think that's right.

The

principle --

4

QUESTION:

And since it would be the only court

5

to construe that statute, you couldn't wait for a

6

conflict.

7

MR. TARANTO:

That's right.

The reading that

8

the Court of Claims and the Federal circuit gave to the

9

statute for a quarter of a century in fact we think

10

reflects the most natural reading of 1500's language.
QUESTION:

11

Are you in any position to make an

12

argument that Congress might be deemed to have accepted

13

that interpretation?

14

amendment that might have picked it up if we accepted the

15

theory that, given the peculiarities of claims in the Fed

16

circuit jurisdiction, Congress might be deemed to accept

17

that?

18

MR. TARANTO:

Was there any reenactment or

Yes, we do have a version of that

19

argument.

20

whole set of statutes governing what was then the Court of

21

Claims, transformed that court into a trial court, claims

22

court and the Federal circuit, and reenacted 1500, merely

23

changing the name of the court to which it applied.

24
25

In 1982, Congress took a broad look at the

By that time, the statute had been consistently
construed in both of the ways that we suggest, and we

think it is an appropriate inference that had it been

2

construed otherwise, its quite draconian consequences

3

would in fact have led Congress to take a second look at

4

it.

5

deprive litigants of rights is I think the best

6

explanation for why no real issue was made of 1500 when it

7

was reenacted in 1982.

The fact that it had been construed so as not to

QUESTION:

Well, did Congress overhaul the

statutes governing the Court of Claims and the Federal

10

circuit in 1982 other than just do what was necessary to

11

create the new court?

12

MR. TARANTO:

It did make a number of

13

substantive amendments in looking through the entire range

14

of statutes.

15

16

equitable relief that it couldn't have provided before.

It added certain limited jurisdiction to

It provided a special transfer statute to ensure

18

against precisely the kind of loss of rights for filing in

19

number of substantive amendments that governed other

21

aspects of what used to be the Court of Claims and also

the court of customs and - -

QUESTION:

Amendments you say that weren't

occasioned by the creation of the new court.
MR. TARANTO:

Yes, that's right.

It was a more

1

general review in 1982 of the statutory regime governing

2

suits against the United States, and in particular in the

3

Court of Claims.

4

When the statute asks if a second suit is for

5

and respect to the claim in a first suit, it is naturally

6

understood, we think, as targeting repetitive litigation,

7

situations where two suits are brought when there really

8

should be one, but that is not the situation.

9

repetition when two suits are brought on different legal

10

rights that Congress has said must be litigated

11

separately.

There is no

12

This is exactly the rule of claim preclusion

13

law, which we think is the obvious place to turn to in

14

defining when two suits should be treated as for or in

15

respect to the same claim.

16

QUESTION:

But you wouldn't need a special

17

statute, would you, if all Congress wanted was the

18

application of claim preclusion law?

19

without any statute.

20

the country apply it without having a special statute.

21

MR. TARANTO:

That would apply

Certainly other courts throughout

What 1500 does is apply before any

22

judgment is reached.

Claim preclusion law only kicks in

23

once there is a judgment in a first suit.

24

is to say a plaintiff cannot proceed in two different

25

forums up to the time of judgment, which claim preclusion

What 1500 does

So 1500 performs a role in addition to claim

5

But would that interpretation that

6

you've just explained have satisfied the congressional

7

concern with the cotton litigation that prompted this

8

statute?
MR. TARANTO:

9

I think it would.

Let me say first that I think that it would be a

10
11

mistake, in any event, whatever that 1868 legislative

12

history concerning the cotton claim * said, to carry that

13

forward to the new statute in a new legal landscape to

14

control the interpretation of this.

15

But even on its own terms, the only thing that

16

one can tell from the 1868 history is that Congress wanted

17

to relax one condition of claim preclusion law, and that

18

is the condition of mutuality of the parties.

19

about the 1868 history suggested that two claims, aside

20

from mutuality of the parties that would otherwise be the

21

same, would be within the statute.

Nothing

The cotton claims would, under the best view

22

23

that we can discover of 19th Century res judicata law, in

24

fact have been the same had they been against the same

25

defendant.

1

claims was the so-called same evidence rule.

If the

2

evidence in one case would be enough to support the claim

3

in the other case, the same evidence would suffice in the

4

claims, it would be treated the same, and a common law

5

conversion claim would under that test be the same as the

6

statutory conversion claim which added simply the element

7

of loyalty, because the same evidence that proved loyalty

8

in conversion would, as with a lesser included offense,

9

prove conversion.

10

QUESTION:

But the --

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, it seems to me that it's

12

possible that the precedent in the Court of Claims

13

decisions is not quite as uniform as you suggest.

14

British American Tobacco case, I think the Court of Claims

15

held that the word "claim" refers to the fact that the

16

facts existing and operating in both cases are the same,

17

and there's a similar holding in the Los Angeles

18

Shipbuilding and Drydock case, and so I'd like you to

19

explain to me whether the precedent really was as uniform

20

as you suggest.

21

MR. TARANTO:

The

I think it was when you take time

22

into account.

Like any other body of precedent, at a

23

certain point earlier decisions are reinterpreted and

24

perhaps even altered.

1

broader view.
What happened, then,

2

in 1956 with the Casman

3

case was that the court recognized that where Congress has

4

existed that claims be brought in two different forums,

5

they should not be treated the same.
QUESTION:

6
7

But Los Angeles Shipbuilding was

decided after Casman.

8

MR. TARANTO:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. TARANTO:

10

I think within a year of that.

But shortly after that,

it became

11

the established rule,

12

Court of Claims, that if a litigant was forced into two

13

separate suits, they were not to be treated as the same,

14

and I certainly don't know of a single instance -- and I

15

don't think the Government has cited one -- where any

16

litigant was thrown out under 1500 after Los Angeles

17

Shipyard, which may simply have not fully appreciated

18

Casman.

19

repeated over and over again in the

But in any event,

since the early sixties, for

20

30 years I don't think there's a single case where that

21

rule failed to be applied where a litigant lost rights by

22

virtue of bringing in two separate suits claims that

23

Congress has said had to be brought in two separate suits.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, has the CA Fed up to now

recognized that rule they're talking about?

MR. TARANTO:

1

It first moved away from that rule

2

in a predecessor of this case, the Johns-Manville case,

3

and then clarified that *view --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. TARANTO:

Well, did it ever accept it?
The CA Fed -- it did, in I think

6

the Boston Five Cents Savings Bank case, if I recall it

7

right.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. TARANTO:

10

exactly.

When was that decided?
That was -- I don't remember

In the mid-eighties, I think.

11

QUESTION:

1988.

12

MR. TARANTO:

13

QUESTION:

1988.

But by the time the CA Fed was

14

created, the -- you say the law in the Court of Claims was

15

pretty clear.

16

MR. TARANTO:

Yes.

The Court of Claims -- the

17

Casman decision had been cited over and over, and it had

18

been specifically applied in 1976 in the Allied Materials

19

case to circumstances even where money damages were sought

20

under two different claims, so that the type of relief was

21

not the only condition for distinguishing claims.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, under the civil version

23

of the same evidence rule that you were referring to a

24

moment ago, would two suits simply based on at least a

25

community of fact but one sounding in tort and one

1

sounding in contract have been precluded as simultaneous

2

suits?

3

MR. TARANTO:

In the 19th Century, the answer is

4

probably not.

5

evidence, as there would be here with the tort and

6

contract claims, if only because there are different legal

7

elements.

8

probably wouldn't have applied, but on the other hand

9

there would have been no real need for it, because --

There is always some difference in

In the 19th Century, that same evidence test

10

QUESTION:

Because you had the mutuality.

11

MR. TARANTO:

Well, mutuality, and in the 19th

12

Century res judicata insisted on something much closer to

13

the legal theory as opposed to the transaction base *at

14

best.
Now, let me say that under this reading, this

15
16

long-established reading of 1500, the statute performs two

17

very limited but sensible functions, and these were in

18

fact the functions that when the Justice Department last

19

year opposed repeal of 1500 it told Congress it performed.

20

The Justice Department did not say that the

21

provision applied to the sequencing of merely related

22

claims.

23

those cases that are within the concurrent jurisdiction of

24

the Court of Federal Claims and the district court.

25

plaintiff -- which includes all tax refund cases and

It said one function was to bar forum shopping in

A

1

Little Tucker Act cases, and perhaps and others.

2

The plaintiff can't just test out the two forums

3

up to the time of judgment and see which judge is going to

4

look more favorably upon its claim.
QUESTION:

5

Little Tucker Act is district court

6

under 10,000, or whatever it is.

7

MR. TARANTO:

8

Yes, up to $10,000, all contract

claims, constitutional claims, et cetera.

9

The second function is to preclude simultaneous

10

suits where there is not concurrent jurisdiction but the

11

plaintiff has filed the case in two different forums, and

12

there the statute simply bars the plaintiff from

13

proceeding in the Court of Federal Claims until the

14

district court's lack of jurisdiction has been

15

established, as it sometimes requires some years of

16

litigation to do.

17

And these functions are obviously modest, but as

18

I say,

19

kept, when it opposed repeal to Congress by reference only

20

to those functions and not to the much more draconian

21

function that it suggests today of sequencing merely

22

related suits.

23
24
25

the Justice Department explained why 1500 should be

And this was after the CA Fed's

change of theory.

It was.

The final reason, then, in support of this first

1

2

position is precisely the draconian consequences of the

3

Federal circuit's new version.

4

Keene, many litigants seeking redress against the

5

Government must file in separate cases, whether they have

6

tort and contract claims, or as many of the amici in this

7

case point out, they have a statutory challenge to some

8

Government action and also are taking challenge.

The fact is that, like

The regular and unavoidable effect of the

9
10

Government's position requiring sequencing of these suits

11

is the loss of many litigants' Tucker Act claims either

12

through the sheer delay of postponing their adjudication

13

perhaps for years, as in this case it would be 7 or 8

14

years, or even worse, through the expiration of statutes

15

of limitations if equitable tolling is unavailable.

17

QUESTION:

How many different cases did your

18

client have pending in connection with this asbestos

19

litigation?
MR. TARANTO:

20

Well, we had two cases in the

21

Court of Claims, which were then consolidated, one

22

involving the contract claims, one involving the takings

1

you be specific?
MR. TARANTO:

2

Yes.

The initial omnibus FTCA

3

action was brought in the Southern District of New York.

4

After that was thrown out the same action was tried in the

5

District of Columbia, essentially exactly the same

6

complaint.

7
8

9

QUESTION:

Why was it thrown out of the district

court in New York?
MR. TARANTO:

Essentially because the

10

administrative notice requirement of the FTCA imposes a

11

specificity requirement that the court found Keene could

12

not meet as to each of the underlying tens of thousands of

13

claims against the Government.

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Did you in effect try to relitigate

that in the District of Columbia?
MR. TARANTO:

Yes, after filing a new series of

17

administrative notices, which were subsequently also found

18

to be jurisdictionally inadequate.

19
20

So you went back and tried to cure,

basically, the defect that the --

MR. TARANTO:

1

Unsuccessfully, that's right.

2

Keene has never had a hearing on its tort claims because

3

of this jurisdictional problem or because of this ruling

4

on the contract claims.
The one other suit that I didn't mention is,

5
6

briefly in one of the suits brought against Keene there

7

was a third-party action impleading the United States and

8

that was voluntarily dismissed in order to proceed on that

The second point, section position, is that

10
11

section 1500, regardless of the scope of the claim

12

language, has no application once the other suit in

13

another court is over, and that's so whatever the court

14

should do when 1500 is raised while another case is

pending.

this.

QUESTION:

But I suppose that the 1500 is

3

couched as a jurisdictional statute, and normally you

4

would think that means the Court of Federal Claims had no

5

jurisdiction.

6

MR. TARANTO:

Justice O'Connor, I think that

7

there are two separate questions to address.

8

whether at the time when another suit is pending the

9

jurisdiction label automatically requires dismissal.

10
11

One is

No

issue is raised as to that here.
The other issue, which is the issue here, is

12

what happens if there was earlier in the proceeding a

13

jurisdictional defect that is no longer present, and what

14

this Court's decision in Newman-Green establishes, what

15

was established even before, is that even as to a pure

16

jurisdictional provision, the existence of an earlier

17

jurisdictional defect does not mean that the case

18

shouldn't go forward.

19

should go forward once that defect is cured.

20

In fact, the court said the case

That's exactly what we have here, even on the

21

assumption that 1500's jurisdiction language has to be

22

read as making it a pure jurisdictional provision.

24

was a jurisdictional defect earlier in the litigation, by

9

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it arise at the very

10

beginning of the second lawsuit?

11

MR. TARANTO:

Well, I'm just saying that as a

12

practical matter the issue was not brought to anybody's

13

attention here for 8 years during this litigation.

14

QUESTION:

But if it's a jurisdictional matter,

15

ordinarily that wouldn't make any difference.

16

something that the Government can waive.

17

MR. TARANTO:

That's not

Right, but in Newman-Green itself,

18

had the parties raised at the outset of the litigation the

19

fact that there was a nondiverse party, and had that

20

defect not been cured, of course, dismissal would have

21

been required.

22

What this Court said in Newman-Green, confirming

23

many lower courts' views, is that even though there was no

24

jurisdiction because of the nondiverse party at the day

25

the suit was filed, and years during the litigation, once

that defect was cured, the case should and can go forward.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Taranto, I thought Newman-Green

3

was sort of, if not a dodo bird, at least an exception.

4

thought the normal rule was otherwise, that if you don't

5

have jurisdiction at the outset, you can't patch it up

6

later.

7

Newman-Green, in which we've allowed absence of

8

jurisdiction to be -- jurisdiction that did not exist at

9

the outset of the case to be remedied later?

I

Do you know any other situation, other than

MR. TARANTO:

Justice Scalia, I don't know of

11

any other example either way on that question.

12

looking for other situations where the question of a

13

jurisdictional defect that existed earlier in the

14

proceeding but now coming to an end has been presented,

15

and I don't know of any situation except the Newman-Green

16

one, and there, I think the rationale does properly extend

17

to other situations, including this one, that a certain

18

measure of practicality is necessary, and once the

19

jurisdictional defect is over, there's no reason to

20

dismiss the suit.

QUESTION:

I've been

Do you think if I'm not a citizen of

22

a diverse State and then later move to a diverse State the

1

2

That has not been the traditional

rule for measuring the time at which diversity must arise.
QUESTION:

3

Yes, I -- that's all I'm saying.

I

4

always assumed that the traditional rule looked to the

5

outset of litigation, and that Newman-Green was noteworthy

6

because it was an exception to that.

7
8

MR. TARANTO:

Right, but I think Newman-Green

confirmed what was a longstanding recognition in the lower
courts that a jurisdictional defect, even if it required

10

dismissal when it was present, did not necessarily require

11

dismissal once the defect was over.
QUESTION:

12

Well, Mr. Taranto, you -- if there's

13

a suit pending in another court when you file a suit in

14

the Court of Claims, and the Court of Claims dismisses it,

even though at the time of the dismissal the other suit

has itself been dismissed -- which is the case here, isn't

it?

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, the Tucker Act has a

rather unusual formulation.

the end of the case.

4

MR. TARANTO:

We - - I mean, I do think that it

5

does help.

I don't want to place too much weight on it,

6

but it does suggest that 1500 appearing amidst numerous

7

other provisions that talk about jurisdiction to enter

8

judgment properly can be interpreted to focus on the

9

presence of any jurisdictional defect at the time judgment

10

is entered, judgment -- the entry of judgment often being

11

described as the single distinguishing characteristic of

12

what makes a court a court as opposed to anything else.

13

15

QUESTION:

But how then do we explain its

authority at the outset?
MR. TARANTO:

Well, for one thing its authority

at the outset, before 1948 section 1500 didn't use the

17

word, "jurisdiction" at all.

18

what should happen in the filing and the prosecution of a

19

claim, and there I think the language helps us

considerably, because one would not ordinarily think that

a rule like that should automatically carry the rigid

dismissal result as a matter of remedy.

1

Claims itself regularly applied, starting in the 1960's,

2

time and time again to merely require a stay of the case,

3

or a suspension of the case, and that rule says two

things:

5

goes forward once the defect is no longer present.

1) what is at issue here, which is that the case

6

The other thing that it says, which is not

present here, is that even at the time the defect is

present, dismissal is not required, mere suspension will

do, and I should note that in the Pennsylvania Railroad

would remain.

the other question is, what would be the remedy for a

One is merely suspending the case, does

As to both, I think, the case would still be
proper, that mere suspension would be required.
QUESTION:

All the same, you'd have to say,

though, that the statute was violated at some point, but

11

you'd just say, bygones are bygones.

12

MR. TARANTO:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, if --

It was violated when it was brought,

14

but it's no longer being brought, it's only being

prosecuted, and that's okay.

MR. TARANTO:

If the filing took place at a time

when the statutory condition was met, then the statute was

violated at that time.

Let me just refer, finally, to the arguments in

20

our briefs for both nonretroactivity and equitable tolling

in the event this Court adopts the Federal circuit's

interpretation, both of which rest on the fundamental

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The text of section 1500 speaks in the language

10

of subject matter jurisdiction.

11

a certain category of cases from the subject matter

12

jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims.

13

It unmistakably excludes

That court's sole function is to hear claims

14

against the United States for monetary awards and

15

occasionally certain ancillary relief.

16

against the sovereign, and just as waivers of sovereign

17

immunity are to be strictly construed, an express

18

exclusion from the waiver of sovereign immunity that

19

Congress has enacted should be fairly construed to

20

accomplish its purpose of restricting the waiver of

21

sovereign immunity.

22

These are claims

So much of the argument that has been made on

23

behalf of the petitioner in this case that claims that

24

Congress has authorized might be foreclosed by this

25

provision overlooks the fact that this provision is an

1

exclusion on the waiver of sovereign immunity, and to the

2

extent this provision applies, the claims are not

3

authorized against the United States.

4

From the beginning in 1868, when the predecessor

5

statute was enacted, the central purpose was clear, and

6

that was to prevent simultaneous litigation of related

7

claims.

8

categories of claims the Congress focused on in the same

9

court.

10

The cotton claimants were unable to bring the two

That's the common sense of it.
Petitioner has theorized about whether it could

11

have brought - - whether those claimants could have brought

12

the cases in the same court if the claims against the

13

Federal officers could have been brought against the

14

United States, but there was no possibility of doing that

15

at that time.

16

until 1946.

17

The Federal Tort Claims Act was not enacted

So from the beginning it was recognized that the

18

paradigm class of cases that the statute was designed to

19

apply to were cases in which related claims had to be

20

brought in two different courts, and the purpose of the

21

statute was - -

if you were going to sue a local official who converted

the cotton, you would have to sue where that official was

found?
MR. WALLACE:

5

Well, that certainly was the

6

practical reason why most of those cases were brought

7

outside of Washington, but if they had been brought in

8

Washington, it could not have been in the Court of Claims,

9

which would not have had jurisdiction over suits against

10

the officers.

11

in their individual capacity for having committed a tort

12

while they were supposedly conducting their official

13

duties.

14

In those days, the officers had to be sued

QUESTION:

So you say, even if there hadn't been

15

the venue problem, there would have been a jurisdictional

16

problem.

17

MR. WALLACE:

Exactly so.

They would have had

18

to be brought in the district court here, rather than in

19

the Court of Claims, so from its outset it was recognized

20

that it applied to force claimants to choose between --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. WALLACE:

23
24
25

Let me be sure I understand -Two different claims -- related

claims.

why they had to be brought in different suits.

If

recovery was going to take the form of recovery against

would be the same in either event, would it not?

formal procedural difference between the two suits.

would read differently, because in one case it would read

The one significant change that was made in the

2

statute was made to carry this function forward after the

3

enactment of the Federal Tort Claims Act in 1946, in which

4

these suits, the tort claims that formally had to be made

5

against officers could now be made against the United

6

States, and so in the 1948 addition of the Judicial Code,

7

as the revisers redrafted this, they added suits against

8

the United States in any other court to the original

9

language that referred only to suits against officers in

10

any other court, so the substance was being carried

forward.

12

In fact, the revisers' note said this was

nothing but a change in phraseology, but the substance of

precluding putting the Government to simultaneous defense

points that I believe led the court in the Federal circuit

to reexamine its series of precedents in this matter.

Court has to do with the purpose of the rule, and why the

rule applied to the situation that Keene had presented to

petition, the rule propounded by the panel whereby if the

claimant dismissed its district court case before the

4

Court of Federal Claims ruled on the motion to dismiss,

5

then it would have been all right for the two suits to go

6

forward simultaneously, one of the alternative grounds

7

proposed by petitioner today.
What we said in the rehearing petition was, the

8

9

rule propounded by the panel would permit a claimant to

10

tie up Government resources in two courts simultaneously

for an indefinite period of time while the claimant

continues to assess its relative chances of recovery in

one forum or the other.

MR. WALLACE:

That remains for determination in future litigation.
QUESTION:

Have you got to the second reason you

gave the Federal circuit?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the second point in the

11

rehearing petition was that the rule adopted by the panel

12

in focusing on the time that the motion was ruled on was

13

logically inconsistent with one of the exceptions that the

14

old Court of Claims had developed to section 1500, the so-

15

called Tecon exception, which focused exclusively on the

16

time of filing complaints and said that so long as the

17

complaint is filed first in the -- what was then the

18

claims court, and then is filed in the district court,

19

it's all right for both cases to go ahead simultaneously.

20

It's only if another suit was already pending in

21

a district court when the claim was filed in the old Court

22

of Claims that 1500 would be applied, and our point was

23

that there was a logical inconsistency between these two

24

doctrines, and we could not say that either of them was

25

consistent with the language or purpose of section 1500

and therefore we agreed with the dissenting opinion of

2

Judge Mayer on the panel that the court might be well

3

advised to review its precedents under 1500 altogether,

4

because they had strayed so far from the language and

5

purpose of the statute.

QUESTION:

Section 1500, Mr. Wallace, doesn't

affect claims pending in any court other than the Court of

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

In other words, one could have

11

pending several actions in different district courts

12

throughout the country, and they would be in no way

13

affected by section 1500.

14

MR. WALLACE:

It is an exclusion of jurisdiction

15

only in the Court of Federal Claims, that is what it in

16

terms does.

17

the Court of Federal Claims otherwise would have if these

18

related claims are pending.

It provides an exception to any jurisdiction

MR. WALLACE:

That is both our position and the

ruling of the Court of Federal Claims in this case, which

9

held that Keene's suit was barred and did not come within

any of the established exceptions.

legal issue, but I don't see how it's the same within the

2

language of the statute.

3

MR. WALLACE:

It's a common legal issue between

4

the same parties, and it also is a common issue with

5

respect to the same facts, and if you can break away

6

individual ones into other courts, you're in a situation

7

where the Government could be subjected to collateral

8

estoppel effect.

9

That's exactly what happened in the Stauffer

10

Chemical case, where the company had first sued to quash a

11

warrant to inspect its facility in Wyoming and had

12

prevailed in the 10th Circuit, and then when the

13

Government attempted to enforce a similar warrant with

14

private contractors to enforce a facility of the same

15

company in Tennessee, this Court held that the company,

16

because it was the same parties, the company was entitled

17

to collateral estoppel benefit of that judgment.

18
19

So the fact that it is not a co-extensive claim
initially really doesn't change that.
QUESTION:

20

Of course --

Collateral estoppel goes issue by

21

issue.

You can have a lot of issues involved in a single

22

claim, so I don't see how the fact that you'd be

23

collaterally estopped as to certain issues in one claim

24

necessarily means that for purposes of this statute it's

25

the same claim.

You say if it involves any issue

7

that's involved in that -- if the other suit involves any

8

issue that is involved in that claim, that would be

9

collateral estoppel as to that claim it is in --

10

MR. WALLACE:

It is in respect to, because we

11

have to worry about defending against it, because it could

12

be used against us in the claim in the Court of Federal

13

Claims were it not for the bar, the jurisdictional bar.

14

Now, it happens that in this case shortly after

15

filing the initial suit in the Court of Federal Claims,

16

the petitioners then filed their omnibus tort action in

17

New York, so to the extent the court -- the Federal

18

circuit was correct in repudiating the Tecon rule now,

19

that issue would wash out of the case in any event.

of defending multiple cases whether or not - - and that

collateral estoppel would not be a sufficient protection

against that burden of simultaneous litigation.

MR. WALLACE:

I'm using the

that also suggests that maybe the Federal circuit didn't

have to go so far to defeat this particular claim.

4

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think it did not.

It

6

Claims on the narrower grounds that that court used, but

7

Keene and the other parties that were before the Federal

circuit that did not pursue their cases to this Court,

9

were arguing for a broadening of some of the established

10

exceptions, and I think it was within the proper

11

functioning of the Federal circuit for them to consider

12

whether, before broadening any of these exceptions, the

13

exceptions were sound to begin with, and this has been

14

hardly a new question.

If I may refer the Court to the leading article

on the subject, what is still the leading article on the

subject, which was published in the Georgetown Law Journal

exceptions had been established, the author -- the editors

of the Georgetown Law Review summarized the author's

thesis as follows, if the Court will indulge me for a

QUESTION:

MR. WALLACE:

No, but I think that it shows that

6

the problems with these exceptions were well-known both to

7

the judges and to practitioners and had caused

8

considerable disuse of the statute, but if I may just

9

quote the editor's summary,

"After a careful discussion of

10

the historical background and judicial construction of

11

section 1500, Mr. Schwartz concludes that the statute no

12

longer serves the purposes for which it was enacted.

13

argues that the tortured constructions made of the statute

14

in efforts to reach equitable results in spite of its

15

wording have resulted in such confusion that it is no

16

longer possible for the practitioner to ascertain what the

17

statute means.

"In light of these developments, Mr. Schwartz

19

urges the repeal of the section and substitution of a rule

of res judicata."

21

That is rather close to the principal submission

22

being made by the petitioner to this Court, although

24

it would require repeal of the statute to reach the result

issue that was considered in the recent 1992 hearings in

which Senator Heflin's bill to repeal the statute was not

adopted by the committee.
There was advocacy of its repeal as well as the

statement opposing repeal by the Department of Justice

6

that my colleague adverted to.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. WALLACE:

9

Did it ever get out of committee?
Not the repeal provision.

All

that got out of committee was changing the language again

10

to reflect the new name of the Court of Federal Claims, if

11

I can keep up with this.
Now, it is also significant that several of the

12

13

briefs amicus curiae that are nominally supporting the

14

petitioner in this case say relatively little about why

15

the petitioner should prevail, and their chief point is

16

that the Court of Federal - - that the Federal circuit

17

needlessly reached the question of whether the Gasman

18

exception should be repudiated, because this is not a case

19

within the Casman exception.

20

And that is the view that the Federal circuit

21

had in the Johns-Manville case as well, and these amici

are concerned about the repudiation of the Casman

exception.

5

same monetary award that was being sought in both courts.

6

I just want to say a word about equitable

7

tolling, which we do not think would be appropriate in

this case because petitioner, with notice of this statute,

deliberately decided to pursue its monetary claims in

three different district courts as well as in the Court of

QUESTION:

interpretation that the Court of Claims had given to the

Well, that's right.

their broader view that the Casman exception really meant
