ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. KATOR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

This cases arises as the sequel to Davis v.

12

Michigan Department of the Treasury.

Petitioners are

13

Federal retirees who, relying on Davis, sought refunds of

14

the taxes Virginia unconstitutionally imposed on their

15

pension.

16

refunds, principally holding that Davis was not to be

17

applied retroactively.

whether Davis must be applied retroactively, and if so

19

whether the Department of Taxation must refund petitioners

20

the taxes unconstitutionally imposed upon them.

The court below denied petitioners their

This case presents the question

In reaching its conclusion to apply Davis non-

22

retroactively, the court below relied on its application

of Chevron Oil v. Huson.

In enacting the Public Salary Tax Act in 1939

Congress said taxes imposed after December 31, 1938 must

What I think is the tricky issue in this case is

not so much the choice of law issue.

issue is the remedy issue.

4

reasons for denying petitioners' refunds.

5

reason was that under Chevron Davis didn't need to be

applied retroactively.

7

The more complicated

The court below offered two
Its first

And that I submit is incorrect.

Its second reason was that under its own state

8

law analysis, its own state law retroactivity analysis,

9

Davis would not be applied retroactively.

As this Court

10

made clear in Ashland Oil, in Beam, and the various

11

opinions in the American Trucking Association v. Smith,

12

the question of retroactivity of a decision of this Court

13

is a question of Federal law, not state law.

14

Supreme Court was simply wrong in holding that as a matter

15

of state law you could deny retroactive effect to Davis.

16

The Virginia

The second thing that the Supreme Court of

17

Virginia did in its second opinion was it suggested that

18

no remedy was required here even if Davis is retroactive

19

because it can continue to consider the remedial, or the

20

equitable considerations of Chevron in the remedial

21

calculus.

22

the statute is unconstitutional as declared by Davis,

23

nonetheless it can deny relief.

It can say even if the law is unconstitutional,

refunds, can it not?

3

MR. KATOR:

Certainly a state can structure its

4

tax refund statute in a way that provides it protection.

5

Certainly.

6

The bottom line, as McKesson makes clear, is a clear and

7

certain remedy for the unlawful deprivation of property.

8

That's what we had in this case.

suggest that McKesson only applies in the situation where

10

it's foreseeable at the time that the statute was enacted

that the statute would be challenged and likely

invalidated.

14

That's not what we have here in this case.

Virginia seems to

QUESTION:

What are the limits in Virginia, the

MR. KATOR:

amended the refund statute to say claims for refunds for

QUESTION:

You can choose not to, pay the tax

You had to pay the tax first.
Yes, you have to pay it first.
Yes.
But I take it, or maybe it's not

10

correct, if you apply to the commissioner for a prepayment

11

remedy would that extend the period of time in which you

have to file your refund because the, I take it the

commissioner can hold your claim in abeyance while the

commissioner is determining it, and then if the

commissioner denies it I take it the refund remedy, the

QUESTION:

Don't they make another argument,

another argument that there's some sort of an equitable

think there's gross unfairness in collecting a tax

for that is the Fountain case and another one that was

analysis in state law cases, and said this is how we apply

it.

MR. KATOR:

And they, the department, the

I don't understand how Virginia could do that,

10

but that comes back to my, to the bottom line of our brief

11

which is if Virginia doesn't provide a remedy, then the

12

Constitution must and the Fourteenth Amendment takes over.

13

Petitioners are entitled to a clear and certain remedy for

14

the denial of their property, for the taking of their

15

property, and if Virginia's statute doesn't provide it

16

then the Fourteenth Amendment would.

17

And I think that this is an important point that

18

comes up not only in this case but is before this Court in

19

several other petitions that are pending.

20

QUESTION:

May I just interrupt you right there?

21

Why would it require it if you acknowledge that a statute

I'm more familiar with, which is the Bass case.

Well, the pay under protest provision in Bass had

There are various ways to go about it.

what limitation?
MS. MARSHALL:

2

It comes with the statutory-

3

interpretation by the Virginia Supreme Court in Perkins

and Capehart that in cases where there is reliance by all

parties on the law and there would be a failure of the

there are two things that the Virginia Supreme Court did

address, and there are various lens that this Court can

look at the case.

Court could find that Davis is prospective, and if it

2

finds that for whatever reason this case is over because

3

there are no other legal issues for the Court to address.

4

If, however, this Court finds that it is not

5

prospective, we submit that you could still and should

6

still affirm the decision of the Virginia Supreme Court

7

below because the Virginia Supreme Court not only

8

determined under Chevron that it was prospective and

9

therefore not an erroneous or improper exaction of tax,

10

which is what 1826 requires, but it also had another leg

11

to its opinion in which it said that under 1826 and under

12

our precedents, Perkins and Capehart, we look in those

13

cases to the reliance of the parties and the factors of

14

the administration of justice in determining whether or

15

not our particular statutory state remedy encompasses the

facts that you petitioners have chosen to bring before us

QUESTION:

Ms. Marshall, did Perkins and

19

Capehart make clear and did you argue in this case at the

20

trial court that the rule is different for post-payment

remedies than it is for the declaratory judgment remedy?

22

It was a declaratory judgment.

12

that was used in many counties.

Capehart came later.

13

And it

Capehart paid the tax and

then asked for the refund, and Capehart's refund claim was

denied.

So I suggest that the prepayment/post-payment is

But whether you say have we litigated a lot of

cases in that area, no, Your Honor, we have not.

19

suggest to Your Honor for several reasons that whether you

20

find Davis to be retroactive or not, the Supreme Court of

21

Virginia should be affirmed because what Virginia has done

22

in the second part of its opinion is it looked to its

23

state law remedy and it has defined the scope even-

has defined the scope of that remedy.

10

that it had certain limitations which we do suggest are

reading it is that it had an independent ground which said

QUESTION:

We

This is Virginia's state law

What the state says, and now they may

be right or wrong, is that the post-deprivation remedy is

10

more limited than the predeprivation remedy, and that so

11

long as the predeprivation remedy is full they are not

12

required to give you a full post - deprivation remedy.

13

MR. KATOR:

Your Honor, I think that that is an

14

accurate statement of McKesson, that if in fact they have

15

a full predeprivation remedy they can have no post-

16

deprivation remedy.

17

McKesson's requirement is is a clear and certain remedy.

18

And it was anything but clear and certain, even after this

19

morning I submit, that Virginia's post-deprivation remedy

20

doesn't apply to this.

rules and say that its post-deprivation statute doesn't

apply, and there are people who have obtained refunds of

unconstitutional taxes under that statute - -

predeprivation remedy, not the non-availability of the

post-deprivation remedy.

MR. KATOR:

Your Honor, I would submit that what

must be clear and certain is the bundle of routes

two statutes, two means to challenge it available to you,

And this brings us back

They simply can't say you have

We dispute that there is

an adequate predeprivation remedy.

you've got two routes and therefore since you have two

I believe Virginia is arguing that its court should do.

But they can't say

Okay.
Not that they should do it now, but

that they have already done it.

Correct, Your Honor, and my point is

I don't think that it is, it can be seen from that.

I

2

think it also bears emphasis that when this case was

3

originally brought in the Eastern District of Virginia the

4

Virginia Attorney General pled the existence of the refund

5

statute as a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy.

6

don't think the significance of that should be lost on the

7

Court.

And I

8

The bottom line as we see it, Your Honor, is

McKesson's requirement for a clear and certain remedy.

I

10

don't think there's any real dispute that Davis must be

applied retroactively.

it meant what it said in Beam, and that it meant what it

said in McKesson, and on that basis to reverse the

decision below.

That being so, there must be a
What we ask this Court to do is

May I ask you one last question

argument that you made, and tell me if I am right on your

presentation.

that?

Did you argue that even if it's not

The argument was, my argument was

your refund statute says erroneous and illegal.

2

the legislature's conclusion of how it wants to gauge

3

this, and therefore you can't play the retroactivity game

4

This is essentially the argument that was accepted by the

5

Supreme Court of Missouri in Hackman.

6

the Supreme Court of Virginia said no, the retroactivity

7

of Davis comes first and therefore, because we find that

8

Davis is not retroactive, it's not erroneous or illegal.

And moreover, just so you know, we have done this before.

In rejecting that

That's essentially what their state law holding was.
