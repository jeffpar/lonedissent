CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 9 -65 6, Edward Soldal v. Cook County,

5

Illinois.

Mr. Stainthorp.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. STAINTHORP
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. STAINTHORP:

This case involves the issue of

10

whether the Fourth Amendment to the United States

11

Constitution protects the law abiding against unreasonable

12

seizure of their home and effects by state officers.

If

3

we look at the history of the enactment of the Fourth

4

Amendment and the historical events that gave rise to its

5

enactment over 200 years ago, if we look at the text of

6

the amendment itself, and if we look at the decisions of

7

this Court construing the Fourth Amendment, then the

8

answer is unequivocally yes, the Fourth Amendment does

9

apply in situations such as my clients' and a seizure

20

unaccompanied by a search must nevertheless satisfy the

21

Fourth Amendment's command that it be reasonable.

22

The Seventh Circuit decision from which this

23

petition for certiorari is taken is therefore wrong in

24

saying first of all that the law enforcement context of

25

the case is relevant in terms of whether the Fourth

1

Amendment applies, and also is wrong in saying that the

2

Fourth Amendment does not protect possessory interests of

3

persons, and also is wrong in saying that the Fourth, that

4

the privacy rights of my clients in this particular

5

situation were not violated.

6

QUESTION:

You know just that the Fourth

7

Amendment protects possessory rights in a piece of

8

personal property just anywhere, do you?

9

MR. STAINTHORP:

The Fourth Amendment would

10

protect possessory rights in the type of property which is

11

protected by the Fourth Amendment.

12

contention.

13

QUESTION:

Yes, that would be my

Let's assume the officers enter an

14

open field and run off with a mowing machine.

15

think that's a Fourth Amendment violation?

16

MR. STAINTHORP:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Do you

I think if that is a seizure --

Well, it's an effect, isn't it, and

it's a seizure.
MR. STAINTHORP:

If it is a seizure, if it is an

20

effect, and if in fact that seizure is unreasonable, then

21

it would apply.

22

apply in that situation in cases such as G.M. Leasing

23

where there was a seizure of cars that were on the public

24

street yet nevertheless that was analyzed as a possible

25

Fourth Amendment violation, conceptually no different than

And this Court has held, that it would

1

the case that you are proposing here.

2

If you look at Jacobsen, United States against

3

Jacobsen, there you had seizure of a, what turned out to

4

be cocaine, an effect, and yet that was again analyzed as

5

a possible Fourth Amendment violation.

6

QUESTION:

Well, there's no doubt that if you

7

seize something incident to an invasion of privacy in the

8

home or some other protected place like a car, why the

9

Fourth Amendment does, is implicated.
MR. STAINTHORP:

10

But the point of those places

11

was that there was no invasion of privacy.

12

Jacobsen the court only got to the possible invasion of

13

possessory rights after concluding that there was no

14

invasion of privacy because of the involvement of, in that

15

case of the private parties and for various other reasons.

16

QUESTION:

In fact in

So a law enforcement officer walks up

17

to a person on the street, grabs his briefcase out of his

18

hand and walks off with it, and then gets a warrant to

19

open it?

20

MR. STAINTHORP:

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

And he had probable cause to have it

22

opened.

23

street is a Fourth Amendment violation?

But you think just seizing the briefcase on the

24

MR. STAINTHORP:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, I do.

Even if it's never opened?

MR. STAINTHORP:

1

Even if it is never opened

2

because this Court has consistently held that the Fourth

3

Amendment does protect possessory rights as well as in

4

addition to privacy rights.

5

of rights are intertwined, as I submit they clearly were

6

in this particular situation.

7

sole violation of possessory rights brings the Fourth

8

Amendment into play.

9

In many cases those two types

But a mere violation or a

If that is not so then the whole line of cases

10

of this Court which are known as the plain view seizure

11

cases make no sense.
QUESTION:

12

But if that is so how do you explain

13

that there hasn't been, that this is the first time that a

14

case like this should have come up in a couple of hundred

15

years?

16

repossessing goods since the beginning of the Republic and

17

we don't have a case in which it has been asserted there's

18

a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

19
20

I mean, sheriffs have been seizing and

MR. STAINTHORP:

Why not?

I think that's not accurate,

Justice Scalia.

21

QUESTION:

Okay.

22

MR. STAINTHORP:

Why not?
Because the G.M. Leasing case,

23

which was a seizure for tax purposes, in that case by IRS

24

agents, did analyze the seizure itself, not any search but

25

the seizure itself as a possible Fourth Amendment

Fourth Amendment that it be reasonable and held eventually

that it was reasonable.

QUESTION:

9

MR. STAINTHORP:

What was the date of that?
The G.M. Leasing was --

1977.
Okay, 1977.

So it's not 200 years.

190 or - -

Well, Judge, I don't think

10

that's true too, either.

11

fact if you look at the history as laid out in the, in my

12

brief, in my opening brief there is a consistent line of

13

cases which hold that the Fourth Amendment first of all is

14

applicable in a non-criminal context and is --

15

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Justice Scalia.

In

I'm talking about sheriff seizures.

16

These things have been going on all the time and very

17

often the person says no, that property was wrongly taken,

18

that they shouldn't have had it.

19

MR. STAINTHORP:

20

QUESTION:

Well, most --

I assume that there's a state remedy

21

and it seems to me the reason has probably been that there

22

is a state remedy for those seizures.

23

you'll get your money back, and therefore the state hasn't

24

taken anything without due process of law.

25

MR. STAINTHORP:

If they are wrong

And for that reason I have not

and it is a Fourth Amendment claim that is before this

Court and not a procedural due process claim.

MR. STAINTHORP:

How do you, how does the Fourth

Amendment.

QUESTION:

9

MR. STAINTHORP:
QUESTION:

10
11

Which reads -Which is due process.

-- no one shall be deprived of life,

liberty, or property without due process of law.

12

MR. STAINTHORP:

13

QUESTION:

14

Through the Fourteenth

Right.

Correct.
So you are ultimately

bringing a due process claim before this Court.

15

MR. STAINTHORP:

In that sense, but this Court

16

has always been clear that civil rights actions, there are

17

basically three types.

18

there are actions based upon a violation of a substanded

19

provision of the Bill of Rights such as the Fourth

20

Amendment, actions based upon -QUESTION:

21

22

There is, Zinermon points out that

Which is what you're claiming here,

isn't it?

23

MR. STAINTHORP:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

I mean, you're bringing an

incorporation argument, not a procedure argument.

(800) FOR DEPO

You're

1

claiming corporation due process.
MR. STAINTHORP:

2

That is correct, Justice

3

Souter, yes.

4

about whether a Fourth Amendment claim is somehow nixed if

5

the state were in fact to provide some process for

6

violation of that right.

7
8

But that issue has really not been raised

QUESTION:

Well, should we address that question

here in answer to this case?

9

MR. STAINTHORP:

Justice O'Connor, I really

10

think you have addressed it at great length in any number

11

of cases, from Monroe against Pape to more recently

12

Zinermon against Burch.
QUESTION:

13

Well, the state in this instance does

14

give your client a civil damages action for the trespass,

15

I assume?

16
17

MR. STAINTHORP:

There's no

question about that.

18

QUESTION:

19

And why didn't you?

20

That is correct.

So you could have filed that claim.

MR. STAINTHORP:

I didn't because under Section

21

1983 the Congress has very clearly, in my view, given me a

22

Federal remedy for this type of action.

23

choose to have this Federal remedy.

24
25

QUESTION:

I therefore

Well, do you think that the action of

the officers was basically random and unauthorized in the

sense the court talked about in Parratt or Williamson

2

County?

3
4

MR. STAINTHORP:

In terms of it not being

pursuant to an established state procedure?

5

QUESTION:

MR. STAINTHORP:

7

fact there is a state procedure - -

8
9
10
11
12

QUESTION:

Right.
Yes.

Yes, that is correct.

So perhaps then that's all the

process that is due.
MR. STAINTHORP:

If I were bringing a procedural

due process claim that would be true.
QUESTION:

But then you're making the law turn

13

just on the technicality of pleading.

14

hole in Parratt because it's just how you allege the

15

violation, and Parratt becomes pretty much a dead letter,

16

doesn't it?

17

MR. STAINTHORP:

You create a gaping

It doesn't at all, Justice

18

Kennedy, and if you look at the cases that have construed

19

Parratt, for instance if you look at Daniels against

20

Williams, where the prisoner slipped and fell, that

21

clearly would not, which was dismissed on Parratt grounds,

22

that clearly would not be a Fourth Amendment case.

23

was no seizure that occurred in that case.

24
25

In the limited number of cases in which a
seizure within the Fourth Amendment has occurred the

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

There

1

existence of the possibility of state process has always

2

been held to be irrelevant and should be irrelevant

3

because the Fourth Amendment itself does not concentrate

4

on the process.

5

on the seizure or the search itself.

6

search is termed unreasonable, then there is a violation

7

of the Fourth Amendment.

8

9

The Fourth Amendment itself concentrates
If that seizure or

It does not create gaping holes in the Parratt
line of cases, which is a very precise holding in those

10

cases which is that when there is a procedural due process

11

case if the state gives post deprivation process then in

12

several instances that is all that you are entitled to.

13

QUESTION:

But I take it the procedural

14

violation is necessarily hypothesized on some substantive

15

constitutional violation having occurred.

16

MR. STAINTHORP:

Well, under a procedural due

17

process claim you would obviously have to show some

18

deprivation of life, liberty, or property.

19

certainly true.

20

narrower question of a Fourth Amendment violation which

21

deals only with searches and seizures and deals only with

22

searches and seizures of a small category of things,

23

persons, houses, papers, and effects, when you are dealing

24

with that there is no requirement that you, that you first

25

file in state court and find that you have no remedy in

That is

But when you're dealing with the much

11

1

state court or that your Federal remedy is diminished by

2

the existence of state remedies.

3

And indeed it really makes no sense that that

4

should be so.

5

provision which in itself provides for there must be

6

process.

7

doesn't look to process.

8

seizure or search is reasonable.

The Fourth Amendment itself has no

The Fourth Amendment looks to a seizure.

It

And it looks to whether that

9

So - - and then if you look at Section 1983,

10

through which obviously I am seeking to vindicate the

11

Fourth Amendment rights of my client, that also has no

12

provision that it is applicable only in the absence of a

13

state remedy.

14
15

QUESTION:

That's what Monroe v. Pape held,

wasn't it?

16

MR. STAINTHORP:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Yes it was, Chief Justice.

But that dealt with a statutory

question basically, not a constitutional one.
MR. STAINTHORP:

Well, Monroe v. Pape was, my

20

understanding of Monroe v. Pape was that it was they were

21

alleging a Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violation.

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

And I think the argument on the

23

other side was that since there were state remedies 1983

24

wasn't really apt, and then the court said no, that the

25

existence of state remedies doesn't prevent as a matter of

1

statutory construction the application of 1983.

2

have to exhaust.

3

MR. STAINTHORP:

You don't

That is correct, Chief Justice.

4

So certainly with respect to the, yes, the interpretation

5

of 1983, there is no such provision.
QUESTION:

6

But 1983 doesn't create any

7

substantive rights and so there was a Fourth Amendment,

8

was that the basis there?

9

MR. STAINTHORP:

Monroe v. Pape I think alleged

10

both Fourth and Fourteenth, although I'm not going to

11

swear to that.

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

13

QUESTION:

Well, the Fourth was there.

14

MR. STAINTHORP:

15

QUESTION:

Yeah.

As it is here.

And of course if the Fourth, if the

16

Fourth Amendment required first resort to state remedies

17

there wouldn't be a 1983 action.

18

MR. STAINTHORP:

Well, that, for all practical

19

effects that would be true because in a vast majority of

20

situations where you have violations of civil rights that

21

also does amount in some sense to a violation of state

22

law.

23

was only operative if there was no state remedy, first of

24

all I would expect to find that in the wording of Section

25

1983 and it just isn't there, and secondly that would mean

So yeah, if you had that provision in 1983 that it

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

(800) FOR DEPO

1

that the vast majority of Section 1983 cases would not be,

2

you could not litigate them with Section 1983 cases.

3

But this Court has really consistently held that

4

that just is not the provision, as the Chief Justice

5

recognizes.
QUESTION:

6

Yes, but the holding in Monroe

7

against Pape was a statutory one.

8

recall, 1983 does not require that before you resort to it

9

you must resort to state remedies that might have given

10

It said 1983, as I

you the same relief.

11

MR. STAINTHORP:

12

QUESTION:

Okay.

But 1983 did not, rather Monroe

13

against Pape did not address the contours of the Fourth

14

Amendment.

15

MR. STAINTHORP:

Yes, I understand the

16

distinction that you're making there.

17

at the Parratt, the Daniels, that line of cases, Zinermon

18

against Burch, the Court has been quite clear that there

19

is, for a Fourth Amendment violation the existence of

20

possible state remedies is generally irrelevant.

21

more that makes a lot of sense because how can a state

22

statute authorize a violation of the Constitution?

23

can a, the existence of a state statute make

24

retrospectively a constitutional violation okay?

25

can't.

If however you look

And once

How

It

QUESTION:

1

Well, in Parratt, in that line of

2

cases, and Hudson against Palmer, tend to cut against that

3

argument, perhaps in a rather limited field.

4

MR. STAINTHORP:

Well, they cut against that

5

argument in a procedural due process case, there's no

6

question about that, and set forth that in such a case

7

post deprivation process may be all the process to which a

8

person is due.

9

QUESTION:

But that just means there's no

10

constitutional violation.

11

procedural due process if due process is provided, whether

12

it's before or after the deprivation.

13

MR. STAINTHORP:

There's no violation of

That's correct.

But there's

14

all the difference in the world between that case, where

15

you are attacking the process and whether or not you are

16

given process, and this case, where you are attacking the

17

seizure itself of a home, a home which comes within the

18

express wording of the Fourth Amendment, which is given

19

heightened protection by the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

20

Are you just, are you basing your

21

primary argument on the fact that this was a seizure of

22

property which would qualify as an effect or as of a

23

house?

24
25

Just property?
MR. STAINTHORP:

No.

House.

It's house and

they're all property.

Well, I know, but house and effects,
They're all property.

3

MR. STAINTHORP:

4

QUESTION:

5

That's correct.

Are you indicating there was any

invasion of privacy in this case?
MR. STAINTHORP:

Yes.

There was an invasion of

privacy if you view privacy as broader than secrecy, which

this Court has historically done.

Well, they got thrown out of their

Isn't that a fairly egregious

invasion of privacy, to get thrown out of your own house?
MR. STAINTHORP:

15
16

White, that it was.

17

QUESTION:

It always seemed to me, Justice

So you don't need to really rely on

18

just the fact that this was a seizure of a piece of

19

property, do you?
MR. STAINTHORP:

20

I don't need to rely on that

21

but I think I have an extremely strong case based upon

22

that also.

not invade the privacy because it didn't invade my

clients' secrecy.

11

that anyone looked into the trailer home or did this as

part of an investigation.

from pursuing their lawful activities.

that, notably in United States against Place where it held

2

that the detention of baggage for 90 minutes was an

3

invasion of privacy of the defendant in that case.

4

no, I'm not saying that any, any involvement or any

disruption of lawful activities is an invasion of privacy.

6

So,

In the fact situation here, however, the prior

7

holdings of this case and I would submit the history of

8

situation.

That is it's an extremely grievous -QUESTION:

The words of the First Amendment

12

don't say anything about invasion of privacy, do they?

13

They say search or seizure.

14

MR. STAINTHORP:

And they

15

don't say a right not to be arrested, but they say the

16

right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,

papers, and effects.

18

here that the action of the sheriff's police in throwing

19

them out of their house and making them move to a motel

for several days, disrupting their life, was a great

21

violation of their right to be secure.

In terms of whether or not that disruption, that

invasion of their privacy was reasonable or not, that

isn't before the Court at this time.

That's correct.

MR. STAINTHORP:

Okay.

So my argument obviously

then is that I come right down the middle on the Fourth

8

Amendment, that this, the language of the Fourth Amendment

applies precisely to this type of situation, and that if

10

you look at the history of the Fourth Amendment - - what

11

was the history of the Fourth Amendment?

12

14

and it was revenue offices going out and seizing

QUESTION:

So that seizure basically is a dead

2

letter unless it's accompanied by a privacy violation on

3

your view?

4

MR. GILLIS:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
To me it's one thing to say that, as

6

we have in Katz and later cases, that a violation of

7

privacy constitutes a search and a seizure, or a seizure,

8

even if there isn't any physical violation of property

9

rights.

But it's quite another proposition to say that

10

when there is a violation of property rights there is not

11

a search and seizure, that privacy, in other words an

12

invasion of privacy is an essential condition for a

13

violation of the Fourth Amendment.

14

that before, have we?

15

MR. GILLIS:

We have never said

I admit that to put any type of

16

ceiling on that conduct would be risky, but on the facts

17

we have here where there is no prying or snooping,

invading or inspecting, we think the Fourth Amendment is

19

not involved.

It may be difficult to say --

they also took guns.

Thank you, Mr. Gillis.

The respondents have now acknowledged that this

12

was a seizure which occurred in this case but have held

13

that it was, but have argued to Your Honors that it was
