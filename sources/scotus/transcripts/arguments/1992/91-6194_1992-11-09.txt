ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. NYVOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves an obvious clear-cut
violation of Rule 43.

That the violation is an obvious

3

one comes from the plain wording of Rule 43.

The rule

4

requires that a defendant be present at the beginning of

5

his trial and prohibits the trial in absentia of a

6

defendant who's not initially present.

7

If the plain language weren't enough the --

QUESTION:

little bit.

Mr. Nyvold, would you speak up just a

Either that, or raise the --

20

QUESTION:

There's a crank at the right there.

21

MR. NYVOLD:

22

The advisory committee notes are conclusive as

Thank you.

23

to what Rule 43 means, even if the plain language weren't.

24

I'd like to --

QUESTION:

Why should the advisory committee

notes be conclusive?

2

the rule.

3

I mean it's this Court that adopts

MR. NYVOLD:

That's true.

But the Government is

4

saying that Rule 43(a) does not address the situation of a

5

defendant who's not present for the beginning of his

6

trial, and the advisory committee notes are helpful in

7

showing that the situation of a defendant not initially

8

present was contemplated by the drafters of the rules and

9

that the rule was intended to address that.

10

QUESTION:

Well, you -- that's all perfectly

11

legitimate argument, but you said the advisory committee

12

notes are conclusive.

3

MR. NYVOLD:

I think -- I'm sorry, I think I

4

used too strong a word.

5

plain wording in the rule, obviously, is conclusive, first

6

of all because it's not ambiguous, it's clear on its face.

7

But since the Government is saying the plain wording of

8

the rule doesn't control this situation, it is helpful to

9

look at what the advisory,committee said.

20

The advisory. -- the rule, the

First of all, the advisory committee notes that

21

are appended to the rule specifically speak of the

22

defendant's

23

Rule 4 -- the advisory committee note to Rule 43(b) says

24

that a defendant may be tried only if he -- if he leaves

25

after the trial beings, and cites the Diaz case.

- the defendant's presence being a necessity.

QUESTION:

1

And you take the position that even

2

if the defendant at the time of arraignment said look,

3

I - - I understand my right to be present at trial but I

4

don't want to be, I give up that right and you folks go

5

ahead without me.

That's no good.

MR. NYVOLD:

6

That's not sufficient for two

7

reasons, or for one reason, that he's not initially

8

present.

9

action to ensure that that defendant appeared at trial and

10
11

The judge at that point would have to take

waived that right after the trial began.
QUESTION:

Well, of course, the practical

12

effect, I suppose, if you are correct here, is that more

13

people ought to be incarcerated pending trial if there's a

14

risk they won't show up.

15

MR. NYVOLD:

Exactly.

That is one option

16

available to the court.

18

defendants who pose a flight risk.

So there are means to deal with this

QUESTION:

But is it a situation we want to

bring about if we have any choice in the matter?

I mean,

1

doesn't it seem odd that

2

such a result?
MR. NYVOLD:

3
4

that the rule would call for

That it would permit a defendant

who didn't appear to put off the date of his trial?

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. NYVOLD:

Yes.
That is the result that the common

7

law permitted, and it's obvious that Rule 43 adopts the

8

common law rule in toto.
QUESTION:

9

Well, well, I wonder if we should

10

bring to the interpretation of a rule adopted by a rules

11

committee and forwarded to this Court and ultimately put

12

to Congress exactly the same sort of construction

3

materials as we bring to a statute.

4

you -- you -- you -- that it's perfectly permissible for

5

us to inquire, if this wasn't the common law rule, why on

6

earth did the rule change it, as it appears to have done.

7

And perhaps we would determine that maybe it didn't change

8

it.
MR. NYVOLD:

9
20

Oh, certainly the rule did not

change the common law rule.
QUESTION:

21

Government disagree on that.

23

briefs?

25

MR. NYVOLD:

It adopted it entirely.

You said -- well, then, you and the

It seems to me here

Am I not right, from your

of a defendant not initially present.

It -- the rule

2

obviously does, and it's the advisory committee notes that

3

are helpful in determining what it was the drafters of the

4

rule wanted the rule to cover.

5

QUESTION:

But what was the situation at common

6

law before there was -- or, say, in this country, before

7

the rule was adopted?

8

MR. NYVOLD:

9

A defendant could be tried in his

absence only if he initially appeared at the trial.

The

10

common law did not contemplate the trial of a defendant

11

who did not appear, as -- even though it was obvious that

12

such a defendant might be putting off the date of his

13

trial, might be frustrating justice, might be flaunting

14

justice.

15

done.

It simply was not contemplated that that was

And, in fact, the Government has not cited one

16
17

case prior to Rule 43 in which the common law dealt with a

18

defendant who absconded prior to trial, was then tried,

19

and that that -- and that result was affirmed on appeal.

20

There are no cases, and the case cited in the Government's

21

brief, Commonwealth v. Felton, a Pennsylvania case, says

22

just that, there are no cases prior to Rule 43 which

23

permit a trial in absentia of a defendant not initially

24

present.

Mr. Nyvold, I -- am I correct that

(b)(2), subsection (b)(2) of Rule 43 was later added?

2

I right about that?

3

exception for after being warned by the court that

4

disruptive conduct will cause removal, he persists in

5

conduct which is such as to justify exclusion from the

6

courtroom.

MR. NYVOLD:

QUESTION:

That was added, yes, sir.
That was a later amendment.
In response to Illinois v. Allen,

10

which allows a -- the disruptive defendant to be removed

11

from the courtroom after being warned.
QUESTION:

12

13

Well, how could we have decided

Illinois v. Allen?

14

MR. NYVOLD:

Illinois v. Allen was certainly

15

within -- or the result in that case, that the defendant

16

who departs or who is disruptive can be removed, that

17

result was clearly within the contemplation of the rule,

18

and here's why.

21

The rule --

QUESTION:

The old rule that didn't have that

exception.
MR. NYVOLD:

The old -- the old -- the old rule.

22

And the old rule read that a defendant who voluntarily

23

absents himself after the trial commences can be tried

24

in -- in his absence.

QUESTION:

To say that making a fuss at trial is

being voluntarily absent.
MR. NYVOLD:

I don't know.

Well, the disruptive defendant can

be equated to someone who is voluntarily absent.

QUESTION:

MR. NYVOLD:

Only if you want to.

I don't know --

Well, as it's -- it's not difficult

8

to, or it's certainly within the scope of the language to

conclude that - -

10

QUESTION:

No, I think -- I think that -- I mean

11

I have a problem with that as far as your case goes.

12

seems to me that if -- if you think that Illinois v. Allen

13

was rightly decided, you -- you acknowledge that the rule

14

is not exclusive and that there are some other reasons why

15

you may allow the trial to proceed without the defendant.

16

I find it very difficult to say that someone is

17

voluntarily absent if he disrupts the trial, and is

18

therefore, you know, required to leave.

19

MR. NYVOLD:

It

Functionally, that's the equivalent

20

of being voluntarily absent.

21

impossible to proceed, a decision has to be made.

22

we're going to remove this defendant or we're going to

23

continue with him, and the trial obviously can't continue

24

in those circumstances.

1

the situation here, and I gather you're saying that it's

2

just like the rule just doesn't speak to a disruptive

3

defendant.

4

MR. NYVOLD:

My point is that the rule, as it

5

was previously written, permitted the result in Illinois

6

v. Allen.

7

have -- we would have to basically engraft an exception

8

onto Rule 43 that was not within the contemplation of the

9

drafters.

10

Here, we don't have anything like that. We

The reason that Rule 43 wasn't -- or was

11

intended to address the situation of the defendant not

12

initially present is obvious from the notes appended to

13

the first draft of Rule 43, and this was in 1943, in which

14

the initial draft read that a defendant has the right to

15

be present at arraignment.

16

later that was changed to shall be present, and the reason

17

it was changed to shall be present was just to avoid a

18

defendant from exercising a right of -- his right of

19

presence by not attending, by opting not to attend.

20

And the Government says, well,

And it appears that the present version of the

21

rule, the one that says the defendant shall be present,

22

was proposed by Judge Sanborn of the Eighth Circuit, and

23

this was in 1943.

24

has appended to it his own comment, which is that, quote:

1

criminal trials in the absence of the defendant.

2

never been the practice, and whether the defendant wants

3

to attend the trial or not, I think he should be compelled

4

to be present.

5

of course, no reason why he should -- the trial should not

6

proceed without him.

7

That has

If, during trial, he disappears, there is,

So this is the person who proposed, apparently,

8

the draft that we have right now.

And that person, Judge

9

Sanborn, obviously didn't feel that the common law

10

permitted the trial in absentia of a defendant who wasn't

11

present.
And if you look at the first advisory committee

12

13

note appended to the first draft of Rule 43, that -- and

14

this is the draft that says the defendant simply has a

15

right to be present, it doesn't say he shall be present.

16

This is the very first advisory committee draft and it

17

says:
The second sentence permits continuing with the

18
19

trial in a felony case not punishable by death or in a

20

misdemeanor case when the defendant, by his voluntary act,

21

absents himself after the commencement of trial.

22

this provision the defendant is required to be present at

23

arraignment, at plea, and the trial must begin in his

24

presence.

So the first published draft of Rule 43 had that

appended to it.

QUESTION:

2

3

It was obvious -Well,

the -- the -- the comment went

further than the actual rule did itself.

4

MR. NYVOLD:

At that time, yes.

But that's

5

significant because it shows that even though the rule

6

didn't make it explicit, at least at that time,

7

defendant had to be present,

8

said that the defendant must - - or the trial must begin in

9

the defendant's presence.
QUESTION:

10
11

the advisory committee note

Well, that may reflect on the

competence of the advisory committee.
MR. NYVOLD:

12

though,

Well,

they -- they were citing the

in connection with that.

9

that the

Immediately

And -The - -

I guess the rule --

the rule now says shall, doesn't it?
MR. NYVOLD:

20

It says shall.

The Government says

21

that the -- the right to be present versus shall be

22

present is indicative only of an attempt to prevent a

23

defendant from exercising his right of presence by not

24

attending.

25

But it's -- the point I'm making here is that

,

1

the person who - - Judge Sanborn who proposed the present

2

draft or the present wording of the rule, when he did

3

that, included that language, which was that it is

4

inadvisable to conduct criminal trials in the absence of

5

the defendant, and that has never been the practice.

6

So the judge who's proposing that language is

7

saying we just don't try defendants in their absence, and

8

it's obvious what the committee was -- its intent or its

9

view of the law was at the time it proposed - - proposed

10

this rule.

11

If one looks at what -- well, not only --

12

staying with the drafting history for a moment.

13

Government's brief cites at page 19, note 6, a proposed

14

amendment to the draft or to rule 43, a 1973 proposed

15

amendment.

16

situation we have here where a defendant does not appear

17

for the beginning of his trial, and that amendment would

18

have permitted the trial to proceed in that defendant's

19

absence.

20

The

That amendment would have covered the

The significance of that is that the rule -- if

21

the rule did not -- if the rule permitted that, it

22

wouldn't have been necessary to add that language.

23

the fact that the committee rejected it shows that the

24

committee didn't want the rule to permit the trial in

25

absentia of a defendant who wasn't present.

And

QUESTION:

1
2

Well, the committee was just --

perhaps, just paying some respect to Diaz.

3

MR. NYVOLD:

Well, and well it should, because

4

the rule incorporated the common law rule as stated in

5

Da --

Diaz, and that is what's controlling here.

6

since

we don't, at common law, try defendants in their

7

absence, at least if they're not present for the trial,

8

we're

9

That was the --

That's

not going to permit that under the Federal rules.
the whole point of incorporating Diaz.

QUESTION:

10

But, the -- the -- Diaz didn't deal

11

with a situation where the defendant was not present at

12

the beginning of his trial, did it?

13

MR. NYVOLD:

Factually, that's correct, and that

14

is one of the points on which the circuit courts have

15

distinguished Diaz.

16

lays down the common law rule.

17

factually, the defendant in that case was initially

18

present, that doesn't lessen or detract the force of that

19

common law rule.

But the point about Diaz is that it
And even though the --

And that's what this --or the advisory

20
21

committee and this Court was adopting when it promulgated

22

Rule 43.

23

Rule 43, the exact page of the Diaz opinion is the one

24

cited, the page where the common law rule is discussed,

25

page 455.

If one looks at the advisory committee note to

1

committee was thinking about Diaz, it was thinking about

2

that common law rule that doesn't admit a defendant to be

3

tried unless he's initially present.

4

The common law and case law origins of Rule

5

40 -- I've been talking mainly about the advisory

6

committee treatment of the rule, and that, obviously,

7

deals with the common law and case law origins of Rule 43.

8

But if one looks at some of the important State cases

9

cited in Diaz, it's obvious that no one was tried in his

10

absence if he didn't show up for trial.
The case of Commonwealth v. McCarthy

11

12

specifically said it is irregular and improper to begin

13

trial without the presence of the accused.

14

Way, a Kansas case, 1907, trial cannot begin in his

15

absence.

16

court said the trial cannot begin in the defendant's

17

absence, but if he leaves during the trial it may proceed.

18

In State v.

In Feit v. State, an Ohio case from 1835, the

So Diaz summarized -- gathered together and

19

summarized all the State cases in arriving at what the

20

common law and discerning what the common law said about

21

trial in absentia.

22

QUESTION:

Do you see any constitutional

23

privilege here that couldn't be waived?

24

rule be changed to allow the court to do what it did here?

MR. NYVOLD:

I mean could the

I'm a little ambivalent about that.

1

I would say, first of all, that Diaz could be read broadly

2

enough to equate the Sixth Amendment right of presence to

3

the common law rule.

4

bit too far, because Diaz did, in fact, deal with a

5

defendant who was initially present.
QUESTION:

6

But that seems to take Diaz a little

Well, we certainly have said that a

7

defendant can waive his right against self -incrimination,

8

a right to jury trial, the right to have an attorney -MR. NYVOLD:

QUESTION:

10
11

In - -- you think this is a right that is

in that same league?
MR. NYVOLD:

12

Although I think, as I was saying,

13

Diaz could be read broadly enough to say that the Sixth

14

Amendment right cannot be waived, practically speaking I

15

don't think that -- I'm not arguing that and I don't think

16

the Sixth Amendment should be so read.

defendant could waive his or her constitutional right of

QUESTION:

I think that a

Now, a good many courts have -- have

21

read the rule as not preventing their practice in

22

accordance with what was done here.

23

MR. NYVOLD:

7

the common law -- or, I'm sorry, the advisory committee

this situation.

It would have permitted a defendant who

The Government's arguments as to why the rule

Well, the Government's

concerns about defendants holding up trials and flaunting

justice obviously had to have been known to the drafters

of the rule, and the Government's argument now seeks to

elevate that concern above the rule that was drafted in

awareness of it.

7

There is at least one State that has

specifically, by case law, prohibited trying a defendant

I'm not

The next

stage, obviously, will be the defendant who hasn't been

arraigned.

Now, arraignment is a precondition of trial,

10

or is a sine qua non of trial, but if the Government is

11

able to succeed in this case in having the rule ignored,

12

then why not ignore the part of the rule that says the

13

defendant cannot be tried unless he's been arraigned?

14

And the requirement that the defendant be

arraigned prior to trial is the same part of the rule

requiring his presence at trial.

They

those circumstances, could have expressly prohibited it,

2

or it could have left the matter for courts to decide.

3

We think the drafters took the third route.

4

They left the matters for the courts because the issue had

5

not been resolved at the time the rule was adopted.

6

Rule 43 was adopted, every court of appeals that has

considered the issue has concluded that a defendant who

deliberately fails to show up for his trial can be tried

in his absence.

10

Since

Of course, that doesn't always

prevent us from ruling the other way.
MR. SEAMON:

12

That's correct.

I would suggest,

however, that the unanimity of the lower courts in this

respect casts serious doubt on the contention that Rule 43

has a plain meaning with respect to the question we have

him.

the amendment as clarifying a preexisting power, rather

11

than creating a new one, because prior to the 1974

12

amendment the rule didn't expressly authorize Federal

13

courts to exclude disruptive defendants.

14

drafters, in adding the '74 amendment, plainly did not see

15

Rule 43's prior silence on that question as creating a

Rule 43 was adopted the right of presence could be waived;

2

this Court had established that in Diaz.

3

whether the right could be waived by the defendant's

4

absconding prior to trial, and our position is that the

5

drafters simply left that for courts to decide.

It hadn't

been resolved at the time the rule was adopted.

It was an

open question,

8

but nonetheless one that had not been dealt with at that

time,

It was not clear

and has yet to be.
QUESTION;

Well, there's language in the Diaz

11

opinion, albeit dicta,

12

the view that the common law thought that a defendant

13

could not waive his presence at the beginning of trial.

14

MR. SEAMON:

that suggests that our Court was of

My point is that the drafters have generally not

anticipated issues that have not been resolved by the

it.

2

of the rule, that this was yet another situation in which

3

the drafters did not decide to decide an issue that had

4

not yet been passed upon by the courts.

5

We tend to think, in light of the rest of the history

Around the time that this proposal I was just

6

speaking of came up, this Court had granted cert in Tacon

7

v. Arizona to address the question of whether a defendant

8

could waive the right to be present - - as a constitutional

9

matter, could waive the right to be present at trial at

10

all.

11

so the issue was -- was not resolved, although I would

12

suggest that the drafters anticipated that this Court's

13

resolution of that issue may have obviated the need

14

for -- for the amendment that you're speaking of.

15

But cert was dismissed as improvidently granted, and

The -- I'd like to return to the lower courts.

16

because ever since Rule 43 was adopted the lower courts

17

have unanimously held that waiver is appropriate in these

18

situations if the public interest in proceeding with the

19

trial outweighs the defendant's interest in being present.

20

Those decisions are significant in two respects.

21

First at all -- first of all, they cast serious doubt on

22

petitioner's contention that the plain language of Rule 43

23

supports his reading.

24

so many Federal courts of appeals would not have decided

25

the question against him.

Now, if the language were so plain,

1

And secondly, all of the court of appeals

2

decisions have been grounded on common reasoning, which

3

simply is -- is that just as a defendant may waive his

4

right to be present at trial by absconding once the trial

5

begins, he may also waive the right by -- by absconding

6

before the trial begins.

7

defendant's right to be present by giving him an

8

opportunity to show up, but at the same time it prevents

9

the sort of calculated manipulation of the judicial system

10
11

That approach fully protects the

that's involved in this case.
The lower courts take a two-part inquiry.

The

12

13

in fact, knowing and voluntary.

14

it does not mean that the -- that automatically trial in

But we -- we don't think it's necessary, because we think

that the courts of appeal have correctly decided that

trial in absentia, under these circumstances, is correct.

MR. NYVOLD:

No, the prosecutor then cited the

cases or went on to urge that the cases indicate you can

proceed -- proceed against him.

10

The Government, or the solicitor, made the

statement that a defendant can be proceeded against even

12

if he or she is not at the arraignment.

I don't know of

any authority for that.

under Crane v. United States, is an absolute to - -

prerequisite to proceeding against a defendant.

Crane, the defendant's conviction was reversed because,

although he was present at every other proceeding, the

defendant had never been arraigned.

The circuit court opinions make the - - make some

rather facile distinctions in getting around Rule 43.

They say that since the defendant can waive his presence

at any early stage of the trial when some fairly -- or

less significant events like jury selection are going on,

and he -- why can't he waive it at the beginning of the

That clouds the reasoning behind the common law

3

rule, which was to draw a bright line at the beginning of

4

trial.

5

that a defendant can waive the right of presence after the

6

trial begins, but to reason that -- within those

7

parameters,

8

stages,

9

illogical.

The common law has recognized, as does Rule 43,

that because he can waive it during different

to the drafters of the rule, and yet they didn't write the

This, again, was a

That's just irrelevant under the rule.
The Government makes the point that a defendant,

if the rule is interpreted as we urge, will have an

incentive to leave at an early stage of the trial.

a defendant has an incentive to leave prior to arraignment

So if there's an incentive to leave at an early

stage, it occurs prior to the trial.

4

smartest point at which to abscond, is prior to

arraignment, since no one disputes that a defendant cannot

be tried if he hasn't been arraigned.

That would be the

The point that -- the question that Justice --

QUESTION:

The arraignment, though -- if the

defendant absconds before he's arraigned, the State has

not marshaled the witnesses and that sort of thing for the

arraignment the way they would have for the trial, so the

12

-- the amount of inconvenience is considerably different.

13

MR. NYVOLD:

That's true.

But the common law

14

recognized that it was only at the point at which the

15

trial began that that inconvenience factor would weigh - -

16

would predominate and favor - - and permit the trial of a

defendant who's not initially present.
