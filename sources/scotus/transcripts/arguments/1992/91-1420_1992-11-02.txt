MR. TUNHEIM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Redistricting is a power and responsibility that

12

is reserved to the States in the first instance.

13

case presents the Court with an opportunity to illuminate

14

that important principle and clarify the apparent

15

confusion in the lower Federal courts.

16

I intend to direct my argument this morning to

17

the abstention issue:

18

refusing to abstain to an ongoing State judicial

19

proceeding?

21

stark examples of what can go wrong when there are

jurisdictional disputes in the redistricting process.

State interests that are involved in elections, in

11

ensuring the integrity of election districts within

12

States, and at stake are really important principles of

13

federalism.

14

Prior decisions of this Court have established

15

and reaffirmed a bright line abstention rule to be

16

followed by Federal courts in redistricting cases.

17

rule is firmly grounded in the Constitution and by strong

policy reasons.

Now, any discussion of the abstention rule must

start by reemphasizing what is unique about the

23

redistricting process.

1

State legislatures to accomplish the redistricting task,

2

and even when Federal courts do act, they must adhere and

3

defer to State policies that have been developed.

4

deference principle I believe is at the heart of the

5

abstention doctrine for redistricting cases.

6

Now, this rule is limited to a relatively narrow

7

window for the redistricting process, the roughly 10

8

months or so that States have after receipt of the census

9

data and when they have to have district plans in place to

10
11

\

run the first election after that time.
If there is a redistricting challenge in State

12

courts, if there is such a challenge, the Federal court

13

should abstain in favor of the State court action just as

14

it must defer to the legislature.

15

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tunheim, I guess at least

16

Scott v. Germano says that the Federal district court

17

should set a timetable for the State action.

18

MR. TUNHEIM:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Yes.

Do you concede that it is the role of

the Federal court to do that much?
MR. TUNHEIM:

It -- yes, I do, Your Honor.

The

22

Federal court should under the rule retain jurisdiction to

23

ensure that all constitutional and statutory provisions

24

are adhered to by the State in the process.

think the district court erred with regard to the
congressional plan, should set aside that election?
then what would you do?
MR. TUNHEIM:

And

I mean, what is it you're asking?
We are not asking this Court to

take any action with respect to the election tomorrow.
The principle that we are urging on the Court is that the
Federal court must abstain in favor of a State court, and
in this case we had a State court that had an ongoing
proceeding with respect to congressional redistricting.
In fact, in -- at the later stage of the process after it
had been enjoined several times, it finally issued a plan.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose we agree with you and

say the district court erred.

What relief is it that

you're asking, please?
MR. TUNHEIM:

The relief that we're asking with

respect to congressional districts is that the Federal
court decision be reversed and the matter be left for the
State court to complete the process of congressional
district that it - - congressional redistricting that it
worked on throughout the year.

So, in other words, for

the 1994 elections, they would be run pursuant to a plan
drawn by the State court or the State legislature if it
chooses to pass a plan, but it would not impact the 1992
elections at all.
QUESTION:

MR. TUNHEIM:

Yes, it would, Justice White, but

the State court panel was proceeding in view of a valid -QUESTION:

Yes, the State -- yes, but the State

court isn't about to insist on having its own plan govern

6

the 1994 elections if the legislature has come up with a

7

plan of its own that meets constitutional requirements.

State legislature acted anyway.

MR. TUNHEIM:

Absolutely.

The important

principle is that all courts must defer to the

10

legislature.

11

to pass a congressional plan that was signed by the

12

Governor, and so the State court proceeded to draw a

13

congressional redistricting plan.

14

plan that we would urge the Court to allow to go into

15

effect to recognize the power and the responsibility of

16

the State judiciary to address these issues under the

17

abstention rule.

The legislature in this instance was unable

Mr. Tunheim, in response to a

19

question from Justice O'Connor, you said that the Federal

20

district court should set a timetable for the -- does that

21

mean anything more than a deadline?

22

suggesting that the Federal court should tell the -- that

23

one house should pass a bill on such and such a day and

24

another on another day, are you?

No, I'm not, Your Honor.

What I'm

1

suggesting is what this Court in Germano suggested, that

2

the Federal court retain jurisdiction and fix a reasonable

3

time by which the State must complete the process in order

4

to avoid Federal intervention.

5

QUESTION:

And if it isn't done by that time,

6

then the Federal court says, all right, we can't wait any

7

longer.

We're going to go ahead.

8

MR. TUNHEIM:

9

QUESTION:

Is that right?

That's correct.

And your position is that that

10

deadline applies not just to the State legislature, but

11

also to the State courts, that you set a date and if the

12

State hasn't taken action by then either through its

13

legislature or through its courts, then the Federal courts

14

get in.

V

15

MR. TUNHEIM:

That's correct.

16

that's a reasonable administration of justice rule because

17

administration of justice is an important concern in

18

redistricting matters, especially with the very quick time

19

line that must follow.

MR. TUNHEIM:

Well, it was waiting until the

legislature had an opportunity in January.

It was

8

represented to both courts that the legislature was going

9

to meet in January and attempt to pass a congressional

10

plan and attempt to pass a corrections bill for the

11

legislative redistricting plan.

MR. TUNHEIM:

Before January 20.

That's

correct.
QUESTION:

15

I take it you would agree that the

16

time set, let's say, for State court action should be a

17

time which would leave the Federal courts with time

18

themselves to come up with a plan if the State courts

19

don't.

20

You agree to that, I take it.
MR. TUNHEIM:

Yes, I would, Justice Souter,

although I must reemphasize the unique time pressures that

22

are involved in redistricting.

not be possible for two court systems to both work on the

If that is the case, so that any date that would

give the Federal courts time to begin, would not be a date

3

which would give the State courts time to finish.

4

case like that, doesn't it make sense to say that

5

abstention really doesn't have much of an application

6

because if, indeed, that's the case, then by abstaining,

the only thing the Federal court is doing is just

So, in a case like that, why have any

MR. TUNHEIM:

13

Well, because of the unique nature

14

of redistricting, which is a function that this Court has

time and time again referred to as an important State

16

function.

17

19

The -QUESTION:

Well, I know it, but I mean, how does

that help you to get to an answer of my -- to my question?
MR. TUNHEIM:

Well, it helps because what is

20

important for the Federal court to do is to leave

21

sufficient time for the State to complete its process.

22

That includes the legislature if it so chooses to act --

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but if I may interrupt you.

24

the hypothesis that you and I are working on, the only

effect of leaving that time is kind of a gesture of

On

1

politeness because we're assuming that the State courts

2

aren't going to have time to finish by the date at which

3

the Federal courts are going to have to begin if there is

4

no plan in place, so that the only thing we're really

5

doing is going through kind of a - - sort of an after you,

6

Alphonse scheme when you know perfectly well that the

7

Federal courts are going to get into it before the States

8

are going to finish anyway.

9

MR. TUNHEIM:

Well, hopefully, that would not be

10

the case that -- if the Federal court would permit a State

11

to go through the process, both legislative and through

12

the State judiciary, and give them an opportunity to

13

complete this process in the 10-month period of time, that

14

is really what is at stake in the abstention rule.

15

Germano involved a situation in which there was a Federal

16

court order that was issued before a State court order,

17

and this Court - -

k's

18

QUESTION:

Well, that is a difference between

19

this case - - why should the Federal court have retained

20

jurisdiction here since the State court proceedings were

21

initiated before any Federal court proceedings were?

22

MR. TUNHEIM:

Well, I would suggest that that

23

was the rule that was suggested by this Court in Germano,

24

that the court retain jurisdiction.

Yes, but as you should point out in

Germano, the Federal court proceedings came first.

the State court proceedings came first.

3

MR. TUNHEIM:

The only reason for the Federal

some kind of assurance that all concerns of voters will be

resolved in the process.

Well, what -If a State court is ongoing, there

QUESTION:

Are you -- I gather you're suggesting

that -- suppose the State court in this case had finished

both jobs, both the legislative job and the congressional

MR. TUNHEIM:

12

I suggest, Justice White, that it

13

should not review the decision of the State court.

14

there are different parties raising different claims in

analysis is to look to whether the State court provided an

This isn't a question of res judicata

exactly.

It's whether or not the Federal court has the

authority to say, well, the State court should have

provided a minority district here and it didn't.

25

State court had considered it and rejected the notion.

And the

1

Now, can the Federal court displace the State court in

2

that respect?

3

MR. TUNHEIM:

Absolutely not.

The rule should

4

be, as stated in Germano -- and I recognize the factual

5

situation is a little bit different here, in fact, more

6

favorable to the State interests - - the Federal court

7

should not have an opportunity to review on the merits

8

what the State court has done.

That appeal is through the

10

QUESTION:

Of course, the State court hadn't

11

finished the job when the Federal court ruled on

12

congressional redistricting.

13

MR. TUNHEIM:

14

QUESTION:

Pardon?

I'm sorry.

The State court had not, as a matter

15

of fact, finished the job on the congressional

16

redistricting when the Federal court acted.

17

MR. TUNHEIM:

That is true, in part because of

18

the first of the Federal injunctions which stopped the

19

State court from proceeding forward.

20

QUESTION:

What if -- how would your rule apply

21

to a case in which the plaintiff in the Federal action

raises issues that were not raised in the State

litigation?

challenge the redistricting under State constitutional

Our focus is on the merits portion of what the

district court did, its interpretation of section 2, and

our submission about section 2 is this, that the language

of section 2, its purpose, and the underlying logic of

voter dilution claims all combine to suggest that the

10

preconditions identified by this court in the Gingles case

11

should apply to single member district challenges as well

12

as to the multimember district challenge at issue.

13

is to say that minority plaintiffs or any challenger

14

should show that there is a sufficiently large,

15

geographically compact group of minority voters so as to

16

constitute a majority within a particular district, and

17

then that the voting behavior has been characterized by

18

racial polarization on the part of both minorities and

That

Above all, unless there is racial block voting

21

-- and as the district court mentioned, the three-judge

General Starr, I know the Government

does the section 2 analysis in a Federal proceeding depend

at all on what may have happened with regard to section 2

13

issues in a State proceeding?

14

MR. STARR:

It is conceivable, it seems to me

15

just in terms of the orderly administration of justice,

16

that the district court might well be advised to look to

17

the record of the proceedings in the State court case

18

assuming that it had, in fact, had a trial, or at least

19

there were evidentiary submissions and so forth.

Well, beyond looking at the record,

21

supposing a State court disagreed with your analysis and

22

found a section 2 violation that you would say was plainly

That -- I

think the value - - when we look at Scott against Germano

10

and what this Court was trying to do, I think the Court

11

was essentially saying to Federal courts please be

respectful of State court proceedings, and as the Chief

13

Justice indicated, once those State court proceedings are

14

under way there is - - and, in fact, what happened in

It does seem to us that when one analyzes the three-judge

10

you'll see in the appellants' brief, there is evidence

require abstention in deference to a State judicial

proceeding reviewing legislative or executive action.

true, of course, that the Federal court's disposition of

such a case may well affect or for practical purposes

preempt a future or even a pending State court action, but

if the State court proceeding had been allowed to go

Let's take it out of the voting rights context.
Suppose you have a shareholder dispute in a

you must attack, is the current court decree, not the

established.

14

Why wouldn't that be the situation?

MR. WILLIS:

Because here, Your Honor, in

know, the courts must defer to State policy, you know, in

as State policy in January.

It also had no congressional

plan of any kind before it.

The legislature's attempt to

4

pass a legislative plan similarly was rejected as State

5

policy by the veto of the Governor in January, and the

6

State court had not generated a congressional plan.

7

And I would take issue with, by the way, the

8

representation that in any way stays of the Federal court

9

contributed to that circumstance.

As Mr. Tunheim

acknowledged, in its December 9 order, the State court

11

said that we are not going to act on congressional plans

QUESTION:

And you don't defend the district

court's decision to enter the stay here, do you?
MR. WILLIS:

I think that the district -- absent

4

the district court stay, the legislature likely would not

5

have attempted to act on legislative redistricting.

6

think the district court legitimately saw the issuance of

7

a legislative redistricting plan a month before the

redistricting as having a chilling effect on the

legislative process in Minnesota.

QUESTION:

1

I think that's somewhat relevant to

2

whether the State court was dilatory later when the stay

3

was finally lifted; that is, when the legislature had

4

acted, the State comes in and says, well, we moved as fast

5

as we could once the December stay was, in effect,

6

eliminated by the legislative plan having been adopted.

7

If I thought that they could have gone ahead and done

8

something during December, I might feel differently about

9

it.

Do you think that they were able to proceed with

10

contingency plans during December even though they

11

couldn't have violated the Federal district court --

12

MR. WILLIS:

I think the court itself could have

13

proceeded with the development of contingency plans as the

14

Federal court had done.

15

the stay was simply that no action could be taken to

16

implement such a plan and that the parties themselves were
