ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES F. SCHILL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SCHILL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The practice of the Federal Circuit at issue

11

here has resulted in resurrecting patents which have been

12

twice found invalid by district courts.

13

out of step with the precedent of this Court and

14

commercial reality.

15

I want to make three points to you in my

16

argument today.

17

jurisdiction to decide --

18

This practice is

First, the Federal Circuit has

QUESTION:

Mr. Schill, in addressing us, I hope

19

you will tell us how, if at all, your position differs

20

from that expressed by Mr. Coons.

21

MR. SCHILL:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

I certainly plan to, Your Honor.
And tell us whether you think we have

any controversy here at all.
MR. SCHILL:

I certainly shall.

May I proceed

1

QUESTION:

Sure.

2

MR. SCHILL:

3

The Federal Circuit had jurisdiction to decide

Okay.

4

the patent and validity issue, and this issue is not moot.

5

The Federal Circuit's practice ignores the strong public

6

interest in resolving the invalidity issue, and finally,

7

that the Federal Circuit should always reach the issue of

8

validity when presented on appeal in a declaratory

9

judgment counterclaim unless that issue becomes moot

10

through happenstance during the appeal, or if a decision

11

on another issue in the case completely resolves the

12

controversy between the parties, and with respect to your

13

question, Justice O'Connor, we believe that there is a

14

case of controversy that has proceeded since the beginning

15

in this case, there is a difference between the case

16

brought by Morton on the infringement issue.

17

That is, Morton is accusing of infringement.

18

That is decided by a very special set of facts, and

19

Cardinal had separate, independent basis on which to

20

assert its claim that the patent was invalid.

21

patent is, indeed, invalid, then not only does Morton's

22

claim fail against us, it fails against all parties, and

23

not only against the particular products that were at

24

issue in this case, but all the products that Cardinal may

25

wish to make in the future.

Since this issue, or these parties --

2

QUESTION:

I thought,

though, that we granted

3

certiorari on the question whether the Court of Appeals

4

for the Federal Circuit errs when it vacates a declaratory-

5

judgment holding an asserted patent invalid merely because

6

it determines that the patent is not infringed.

7

that's the question as framed, right?

8

MR. SCHILL:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Now,

Yes, Your Honor.
As to that question,

is there any

difference between you and Mr. Coons' position?
MR. SCHILL:

I believe that the way I would put

12

the issue, or resolve that issue,

13

erred because it has not resolved the controversy between

14

the parties in this case.

15

is that the court has

There may be some factual situations in which it

16

need not reach the issue of validity.

17

case might be where the issue of unenforceability was also

18

there, and the court decided that the patent was

19

unenforceable, for example, either against the particular

20

party or parties or the world.

21

QUESTION:

For example, one

Well, you take the position that the

22

policy adopted and now followed by CAFC is in error, that

23

it shouldn't follow that policy --

24

MR. SCHILL:

That's correct.

MR. SCHILL:

I agree that that is the same

position, ultimately, that they take.

how we would express it.

QUESTION:

We differ only in

And so how is there a controversy,

then?
MR. SCHILL:

How is there -- I'm not sure there

is a controversy on the point of what the Federal Circuit

9

should do on which --on which you granted cert.

10

I'm not

sure that there is a conflict between us - -

MR. SCHILL:

QUESTION:

You do argue -We -That different consequences should

15

between a counterclaim and a declaratory judgment, the

16

respondent's saying that the rules should be the same in

17

either case, or am I incorrect?

18

MR. SCHILL:

You're arguing that there's a difference

No, you are correct, Your Honor.

I

19

believe that this Court's precedent in the Altvater and

20

Electrical Fittings case is still good law, and that would

21

require that there be a difference made between cases

22

which are only filed with a bill and answer as opposed to

23

a counterclaim that, by the very nature of a situation

24

such as was present in Electrical Fittings, there was only

25

an accusation, a claim of infringement and no

QUESTION:

2

3

And the respondents differ with you

on that point.

4

MR. SCHILL:

Yes.

They would reach the issue on

5

all points.

6

should reach validity on all points.

7

They would say that the Federal Circuit

QUESTION:

Well, there's still an underlying

8

dispute, of course, as to the validity vel non and

9

infringement vel non of the patent, isn't there?

10

MR. SCHILL:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, there is indeed, Your Honor.
Do you take the position that there

12

is any difference with respect to jurisdictional mootness,

13

depending on whether the issue is raised by counterclaim

14

or affirmative defense?
MR. SCHILL:

15
16

I'm not sure I understand your

question, Justice Souter.

17

QUESTION:

Well, you've argued very persuasively

18

that there is no jurisdictional mootness when the issue of

19

validity is raised by means of a counterclaim.

20

issue is simply raised by means of affirmative defense,

21

does that make any difference jurisdictionally as opposed

22

to prudentially?

23

MR. SCHILL:

When the

Yes, I believe that it does,

24

because a -- there is no right to have a decision on a

25

defense.

QUESTION:

1

Well, there may be no right to have

2

it, but the court still has jurisdiction to render it,

3

doesn't it?

4

MR. SCHILL:

The court does still have

5

jurisdiction to render it if it wishes to reach that

6

issue.

7
8

QUESTION:

So the difference is prudential,

rather than jurisdictional.
MR. SCHILL:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SCHILL:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Okay.
In this case, the court -- the

12

Federal Circuit -- vacated the declaratory judgment of

13

invalidity that Cardinal won at the lower court.

14

The only reason that it provided was its

15

reference to the case Vieau v. Japax, and in reviewing

16

that case, the only rationale provided by the court was

17

that, since there was no indication in that case that the

18

dispute extended beyond the accused devices found not

19

infringing, the court properly exercises its discretion to

20

dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.
QUESTION:

21
22

23

with that?

If that would work, what's wrong

Why isn't that a good reason?
MR. SCHILL:

We find that that would -- that

24

is - - the court is either - - is incorrect in its

25

formulation, I believe, because either the issue is moot

1

and it has no discretion to reach it

that is, it's

2

jurisdictionally moot under Article 3 -- or it's

3

exercising its discretion and has taken into account

4

certain factors in order to decide whether it should reach

5

the issue.

6

Here, since the court adopted this practice in

7

1987, it has merely cited to the Vieau v. Japax case and

8

has gone no further.

9

facts in the case to determine whether there was indeed a

10

11

It has not reviewed the underlying

basis for the continued controversy.
QUESTION:

Well, to say that it has discretion

12

is not to say that it cannot exercise its discretion on a

13

generic basis, and to draw up entire categories of cases

14

in which it will simply decide that it should not go any

15

further, and I think this Court has said one large

16

category is when the issue makes no difference to the

17

judgment below, and it's a complex patent case.

18

We don't want to have to spend the time figuring

19

out the answer to the patent question when it makes no

20

difference to the judgment below.

21

perfectly reasonable?

22

MR. SCHILL:

Why isn't that

Well, if it made no difference to

23

the judgment below, perhaps that would be proper, Your

24

Honor, but I do believe it does make a difference to the

25

decision below, especially in this case.

you're trying to oust the declaratory judgment winner of

I agree you have a much stronger case

counterclaim, just --

13

MR. SCHILL:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SCHILL:

Affirmative defense.
Just an affirmative defense.
Yes.

If there's an affirmative

16

defense, the affirmative defense relies upon the claim.

17

Once the claim itself is gone, then there is really no

18

basis for the defendant to prevail on its counter -- or,

19

on its affirmative defense.

20

QUESTION:

He

So it really makes no difference to

21

the decision below whether the appellate court goes on to

22

review the invalidity determination or not, and why should

23

it expend its energy on that question?

24
25

I mean, of course you can say, well, it'll make
difference to parties in future cases.

Of course it will,

but courts don't usually do things for that reason, unless

2

it affects the parties in front of them.

3

MR. SCHILL:

Right.

We do not take the position

4

that the Court has to.

5

that the Court may reach that issue.
QUESTION:

6

I would still take the position

I'm sure it may.

I think -- let's --

MR. SCHILL:

I concede it may, but why should it?

I think you further take the position it should,

Yes.

don't you --

MR. SCHILL:

MR. SCHILL:

Well -Or you don't care?
Not on the issue, Your Honor, where

15

it's raised as an affirmative defense.

we're not in that category.

that category.

I would say that

I think my opposition is in

QUESTION:

Do you mean no matter how it was

No matter --no.

No matter

which way you decided the validity issue.

Yes.

think that's within the discretion of the Court to decide

2

whether it should reach that issue, based on the facts and

3

circumstances of the case, and it may well say --

4

QUESTION:

But I just ask, wouldn't it save

5

itself some work in the future?

6

MR. SCHILL:

It may well save itself some work

7

in the future.

8

it had been decided all the way in the first case, in the

9

Argus case.

10

It certainly would have in this case, if

QUESTION:

Well, shouldn't it turn, then, simply

11

on whether it has reasonable -- reason to believe that

12

there are going to be a series of similar cases, and then

13

if so, then it would make sense prudentially to exercise

14

its jurisdiction and go ahead and decide it.

15

MR. SCHILL:

I certainly agree, Your Honor, and

16

in this case, that was the case.

17

even of the Argus appeal that there were other cases

18

pending, that two other cases were pending on this, and

19

that basically we're back in the situation of what

20

happened under the Triplett case where a patentee could go

21

on asserting its patent against a series of unrelated

22

defendants even it had been declared invalid because there

23

was no estoppel.

24
25

It was known at the time

After Blonder-Tongue, when this Court created -changed the rule and allowed the future defendants to

1

assert res judicata against the patent owner, then you

2

would take -- you allowed future defendants to defend

3

based on the previous invalidity of the patent by the

4

patent owner, but in effect, because the Federal Circuit

5

does not reach the issue of validity, it returns the

6

patent that has been found invalid to the patent owner, he

7

can go out and reassert it again, and the patent defendant

8

is in a worse position because he can't even use the first
judgment of invalidity against the patent --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SCHILL:

Because it's been vacated.
Because it's been vacated, and the

12

only way he can really get a judgment is if he's first

13

found to be infringing, and then presumably the court

14

would reach the issue of validity.

15

So in this case, since we find that there was a

16

case of controversy, no question about that.

17

important point we think next that the Court should

18

consider is the Court's policies that were announced in

1

the Sinclair case and the Blonder-Tongue case.

20

The

In Sinclair, this Court said that of the two

21

issues the validity issue is the more important.

22

decision on invalidity tends to discourage future suits,

23

saves judicial resources, parties' resources, leaves the

24

field of invention open to others knowing that they will

25

not be threatened with this patent.

QUESTION:

1

If we agree with you and your

2

colleague that the -- if we agree with you there should

3

have been a decision, what do we say, abuse of discretion,

4

or what?

5

MR. SCHILL:

6

QUESTION:

7

To the Federal Circuit, Your Honor?
Yes.

What do we say their error is,

other than, you should have decided it?
MR. SCHILL:

8

I think really perhaps going back

9

they seem to be depending upon this Court's judgment in

10

the Altvater case, and I think what has taken the court

11

off-track is the statement in that case that says that

12

because there were additional claims and devices at issue

13

there was proper jurisdiction.
I think that is minimal.

14

That's an exemplary --

15

either an exemplary issue, or should be limited to the

16

position of -- there was in extent at that point, which

17

was licensee estoppel.
QUESTION:

18
19
20

What do you mean by an exemplary

issue?
MR. SCHILL:

Well, for -- I think that the

21

jurisdiction of the Court is as broad as whatever fits

22

under the Declaratory Judgment Act, and so long as there

23

is a case of controversy under that act, then there is a

24

right to have a determination made, and by exemplary, I

25

meant a case, or additional claims or devices is one

example of when there is still a controversy between the

2

parties.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. SCHILL:

5

QUESTION:

An e.g.
Yes.
Do you think the court of appeals in

6

the original case felt bound to come out that way under

7

our cases?
MR. SCHILL:

8

9

That's the only learning I can get

from their view in the Vieau v. Japax case.
QUESTION:

10

So do you think they've -- if we

11

thought they misconstrued those cases, do you think if we

12

disabused them of their error that they would then decide

13

the validity issue, or would they say, why should we fool

14

with it?

15

MR. SCHILL:

I believe, Your Honor, that the

16

instruction from this Court that the Altvater case should

17

not be limited to the case of that was licensee estoppel,

18

really, that was in extent at that point in time, and

19

clarification that the jurisdiction, so long as there is

20

adequate jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act,

21

that issue should be decided so long as it is necessary to

22

resolve the conflict between the parties.

23

For example, I think that if the case arrived at

24

the Federal Circuit and the patent had just expired, the

25

Court found noninfringement, there's probably no reason

1

for it to go on and reach the validity issue.
The same would happen - - if the Court had

2

3

decided an unenforceability issue at least as to that

4

party, or perhaps as to the world on that patent, it no

5

longer need reach the validity issue for other -- for any

6

other reason, so that those would be situations where the

7

Court should exercise its discretion and not decide, and

8

there may even be instances that I haven't thought of yet

9

where the noninfringement would be an adequate resolution

10

of all the issues in the case, but the Court should be

11

left with the scope to determine what those situations

12

are.
QUESTION:

13
14

What was the vote in the Federal

Circuit?
MR. SCHILL:

15

It was -- well, Judge Lourie wrote

16

a concurring opinion saying that he would have reached the

17

invalidity issue in this case and found the patent

invalid.

MR. SCHILL:

Since I appear before the Court,

3

I'd like to - - I do believe that this Court's teachings in

4

the precedent we've cited in Sinclair and Blonder-Tongue

5

should play an important role in coming to the decisions

6

of whether to reach invalidity in each case.

7

I think it's of paramount public interest,

8

especially -- in this case,

9

that I found difficult to deal with all through the case.

10

It's hard to tell your client that you have to go back to

11

trial on a patent that's already been found invalid merely

12

because that issue was not reached by the Federal Circuit

13

and given finality.

14

I find, you know, a situation

And to have the patent twice declared invalid on

15

the exact same basis to me convinces me that there was no

16

error,

17

very small company, and is something that will continue to

18

happen, we believe, or could at least happen, something

19

that is worth spending some judicial time to correct.

20

that this is a tremendous waste of resources for a

QUESTION:

Mr. Schill,

it seems to me the

21

formula that you're suggesting we adopt, or the rule, has

22

enough imponderables and exceptions in it that it's not

23

going to be too much guidance for the Federal Circuit.

24

We're just going to end up saying, you should have decided

25

the validity of the patent in this particular case.

MR. SCHILL:

In the first instance, Your Honor,

2

I believe the lower courts have the duty to decide whether

3

there's a case or controversy.

4

that decision, then the Federal Circuit I think is in the

5

position of a reviewing court deciding whether the lower

6

court has properly made its decision on the existence of

7

the case or controversy.

8

9

So long as they've made

So long as that review convinces it that the
lower court was correct, then I think it should reach the

10

invalidity issue as long as its raised by counterclaim,

11

because the defendant is left without its remedy to

12

resolve the conflict, the uncertainty between the parties.

13

QUESTION:

And what are the situations in which

14

you say that the Federal Circuit need not reach the

15

validity issue?

16

MR. SCHILL:

The only two that I've been able to

17

come up with so far, Your Honor, are the issue, for

18

example, where the patent has expired somewhere around the

19

time of the appeal, and to decide that issue would really

20

be a moot point.

21

The other would be, for example, if there was a

22

finding of unenforceability of the patent.

Also, that

23

issue would be redundant.

24

would not give any additional relief than the finding of

25

noninfringement.

It would give relief -- it

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose you'd say the trial

As far as the declaratory judgment action is concerned

there's no more basis for the trial court to dodge that

bullet than there is for the court of appeals.

7

MR. SCHILL:

8

QUESTION:

9

No, and I -I mean, I can understand on the

defense, if the trial court wants to just find no

10

infringement it may decide not to go ahead with the

11

invalidity as a defense, but if there's a separate claim,

12

a counterclaim on invalidity, can the trial court just say

13

there's no infringement and that's the end of the case,

15

MR. SCHILL:

Well, the Declaratory Judgment Act

16

is discretionary, so even though there is a case or

17

controversy, to me it seems as if that --

18

To be sure, but is a proper basis for

exercising that discretion merely that you have dismissed

21

MR. SCHILL:

As to whether they should have

MR. COONS:

There certainly is, and there is

decide validity.
I think we differ both in terms of analysis and

2

3

in result, and respondent's position is quite clear,

4

because of this Court's decision in 1971 in Blonder-

5

Tongue, that what is required there is a fundamental

6

right, on appeal, to decide the validity issue on the

7

merits, and that must be done in every case because of the

8

public interest that this Court recognized in that case.

9

That obviously goes beyond the facts of this

10

particular case, because as has been pointed out, this

11

case does involve a situation in which there is a

12

declaratory judgment action.

13

rare case in which a defendant infringer does not

14

interpose a declaratory judgment action.

15

In fact, it is probably the

But conceptually, the reason why the Federal

16

Circuit should address the validity issue has nothing to

17

do with whether there is the presence of a declaratory

18

judgment count or not.

19

It's really bottomed in this Court's analysis in

20

the Blonder-Tongue case, and it's kind of interesting to

21

look at the position of the petitioners and the respondent

22

in that case, because in both of their briefs, neither

23

petitioner nor the respondent urged that the Triplett rule

24

which was then in effect ought to be modified in any

25

respect.

1

In fact, what they said is the Triplett rule

2

should be maintained, and in this Court's Blonder-Tongue

3

decision, it stated in petitioners' brief at page 12,

4

"Though petitioners stand to gain by any such result, we

5

cannot urge the destruction of a long-accepted safeguard

6

for patentees merely for the expediency of victory."

7

And that safeguard that was referenced in that

8

was the safeguard against an improvident judgment of

9

invalidity, because under the Triplett rule, it really

10

made no difference whether the patent was held valid or

11

invalid except with respect to the particular parties,

12

because in that setting it would be res judicata as

13

between the particular parties.

14

But beyond that, if there was another party who

15

was believed to infringe, then a second suit could be had,

16

so that safeguard was the ability on the part of the

17

patent owner to file multiple lawsuits.

18

And what this Court decided in Blonder-Tongue

19

was no, that is not proper.

20

deciding validity of patents, and what should be done is

21

to provide the patent owner with one full and fair

22

opportunity, and respondents submit that that one full and

23

fair opportunity inherently includes the right to a

24

decision on appeal with respect to the merits of the

25

validity issue.

1

So you would say that if a -- the

infringement claims and claims on the other side of

the district court, if there's a validity issue presented,

it should be decided.

5

MR. COONS:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
Are you telling us, or can you tell

7

us that in almost every instance of patent litigation in

8

the district court the district court reaches both issues?

9

MR. COONS:

I think that's correct.

I'm aware

10

of certain situations in which bifurcation is done, for

11

example, and issues are decided one by one, but in

12

virtually every case I think the practice is that the

13

district court does decide both issues.

14

QUESTION:

It would seem to me that there may be

15

cases in which the evidence on infringement, the proof

16

that's necessary to resolve the infringement is very

17

easily managed and the patent validity question is

18

extremely complicated, and that it's only wise for the

19

district court to proceed to the infringement issue just

20

to dispose of the case.

21

MR. COONS:

And I think that certainly could be

22

done by the exercise of judicial restraint, and like any

23

court which is not a court of last resort, the problem

would be that what may be entirely clear to that trial

court, the appellate court may decide that's not the case

and then send it back down for validity, but certainly

Is there discretion also in the

think there would be discretion to do so, but if you --

13

once there is an appeal and the issue has been -- well,

let me backtrack on that.

I think in those circumstances, if non -- if

with -- I guess my position is the same, that if validity

19

has never been decided, it's never been put into issue,

20

then I don't think Blonder-Tongue would come into play,

21

and the Federal Circuit would have the same discretion

22

that the trial court would, because an infringement would

decide the issue.

under our position, as respondents, Blonder-Tongue

2

requires a consideration of the validity issue upon appeal

3

in any instance, except for the rare situation in which,

4

for example, a patent has expired and which, under what

5

has been called prudential mootness, the issue of whether

6

the patent is valid or not is so attenuated that it

doesn't make any difference.

then go ahead and consider that issue and go ahead.

It would be imprudent to

10

validity has been put into issue, then it becomes part of

12

QUESTION:

If we were to adopt that rule, is

13

there any danger that powerful and well-funded patent-

14

holders could pick their target for declaratory relief by

prompting a suit from an infringer, by suing an infringer

with very little assets?

MR. COONS:

I don't think it would really make

any difference.

Why wouldn't it?

If I wanted to test

a patent and to sue for infringement, I'd probably pick

the weakest defendant in sight.

22

MR. COONS:

But even if that were done, and even

if there were a decision of -- that the patent was valid,

technically it's the defendant's burden, so the holding

9

and prior to 1986, in '87 when this Vieau practice came

10

into play, they had decided routinely both validity and

11

infringement.
And in those cases statistically, almost as many

12

13

times as not, the patents that were held valid by the

14

district court were reversed on appeal -- or, excuse me,

15

the patents that were held invalid about 50 percent of the

16

time were reversed on appeal and the patent was held

17

valid.

18

And I think that what came out of Blonder-Tongue

19

and why it's important to the public is that there ought

20

to be some certainty of result once the validity issue has

21

been raised so that you can distinguish between patents in

22

which the validity claim has not been established and

23

those in which the invalidity claim was in fact correct,

24

and to the extent that there were "scarecrow patents" or

25

the like, that those patents should be out of the rolls.

The public should not have to face -QUESTION:

2

What I'm saying is, I don't

3

understand what that means if you say the whole thing can

4

be relitigated again in the next case, anyway.

5

MR. COONS:

It can only be relitigated if the

6

validity of the patent is restored, or is determined on

7

appeal.

8

again and -- but that would be left, then, to another

9

lawsuit, and that would be part of the multiple litigation

If it isn't, that issue can certainly come up

10

in which this 50 percent of the patents that would have

11

been held invalid then are still on the rolls, if you

12

will, and it takes another lawsuit, another allocation of

13

resources, to deal with the issue.

that's the end of it.

going to have to keep on litigating it, no matter what.

MR. COONS:

21

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's correct.

But will the court of appeals on

22

essentially the same charge of invalidity, if it has

23

previously found a patent valid, adhere to its earlier

24

decision?

25

MR. COONS:

I think that's a good question.

I

don't know.

2

ever -- if I can think of the case in which the -- the

3

Federal Circuit has looked at the issue of validity on two

4

different occasions.

5

patent has been held valid in one case and then held

6

invalid in a second or third case, and I think -- so there

7

are those sorts of situations, I just don't know if the

8

Federal Circuit has itself dealt with that sort of an

9

issue.

10

I can't recall, as I'm standing here if I can

QUESTION:

I am aware of situations in which a

Well, suppose the appellate court is

11

dealing with a case in which the district court has found

12

the patent to be valid.

13

say, well, there's really not much use in - - if I vacate

14

the decision below without ruling on the validity issue,

15

I'm really not depriving anybody of anything, because that

16

validity would be relitigable anyway in the next case.

17

Why isn't that a situation where, in the sound exercise of

18

its discretion, the court of appeals might say, I'll just

19

leave it be?

20

MR. COONS:

Why can't the appellate court

Well, I think it certainly -- I

21

think it certainly could, and there certainly is a

22

distinction between whether a patent has been held invalid

23

in the trial court or whether it has been held valid.

24
25

QUESTION:

Invalid is a stronger case for

getting to it on appeal, a much stronger case, isn't it?

MR. COONS:

1

That certainly -- that certainly is

2

the case, but if you follow Blonder-Tongue and you look at

3

the concept of wanting to provide one full and fair

4

opportunity, that includes the right to appeal on the

5

merits, because just as the trial court could be wrong on

6

either of that, you prevent that sort of a situation and

7

it could be that the valid holding was incorrect and the

8

patent should be held invalid.
Certainly there is a presumption of validity,

9
10

and it's less of a problem, but if, in fact, patents are

11

imbued with a public interest that is throughout this

12

Court's opinion in Blonder-Tongue, then conceptually it

13

should not make any difference whether the trial court's

14

decision was valid or invalid, it ought to be considered

15

on appeal.

16

QUESTION:

Would it make any difference as

17

long -- if validity's at issue, and infringement is at

18

issue in a trial court, would it make any difference

19

whether the patent was held to be infringed or

20

noninfringed?

21

MR. COONS:

Not insofar as Blonder-Tongue is

22

concerned and in our position with respect to considering

23

that issue on appeal.

24
25

I think that it ought to be considered in either
event, because if patents do in fact have a public

1

interest, and certainly respondents contend that both good

2

patents and bad patents ought to be identified and there

3

ought to be a separation between the two, and that the

4

issue ought to be resolved, then Blonder-Tongue would say

5

regardless of whether -- how the infringement issue was

6

decided, the validity issue ought to be decided on appeal.

7

Now, obviously, by exercising judicial restraint

8

and the like and in the management of legal issues, to

9

conserve their time the Federal Circuit may choose to

10

decide the validity issue first, as Judge Lourie had

11

suggested.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

Wherein does your position differ

from Mr. Schill's in this respect, Mr. Coons?
MR. COONS:

I think it differs in the respect

15

with which we were just discussing.

16

before this Court, where there is a declaratory judgment

17

held, we do not have any difference whatsoever.

18

contention is that this Court is faced with in effect

19

rationalizing its cumulative precedent.

20

Electrical Fittings, and Blonder-Tongue, and that in our

position it really is immaterial whether there is a

That's correct.
At least where it's been -- well, of

course, where it's been decided by the lower court --

7

MR. COONS:

8

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And when you were speaking earlier

9

about when the lower court had to decide it in your view

10

and it would be an abuse of discretion not to decide it,

11

were you assuming that there was a declaratory judgment

12

counterclaim or not, because frankly I - - it seems to me

13

that it's up to the district judge how many issues he

14

wants to resolve.

15

I'm not inclined to say that he has to resolve

16

two issues if one will get rid of the case, but when

17

there's a declaratory judgment claim, I feel a little bit

18

differently about it.

judgment claim only, or do you assert that even when

20

there's only an affirmative defense the district court has

21

an obligation to reach the invalidity point?

MR. COONS:

Were you addressing the declaratory

situation in which trial courts have in fact exercised

to interpret the claims, and if you interpret the claims

broadly you may have a stronger claim of invalidity, or if

you construe them narrowly there's a better defense to the

1

the two issues may color your determination of the other

2

issue.

Am I right on that, or is it --

3

MR. COONS:

4

QUESTION:

You are correct.
Yes, and I don't know if that might

5

complicate it, and I'm -- very frankly, one of the things

6

that worries me about a case where you don't have an

7

adversary on the precise question before us, and much of

8

the discussion is about other cases where there's an
affirmative defense, and so forth, whether we really have

10

11

any business talking about that.
The case before us seems to me very easy, but

12

we've talked hypothetically about all sorts of situations,

13

and I'm not sure it would be appropriate for us to go much

14

beyond what we have to do to decide this case.

15

MR. COONS:

Well, I think it depends on - - I

16

think I would be certainly satisfied with that result, but

17

I think this is an opportunity for this Court to provide

18

some definitive bright line approach that would, I think,

satisfy all the parties.

1

MR. COONS:

Oh, I'm sure that that happens.

I

2

think in this case to resolve it I'm looking at the

3

Federal Circuit practice, and I think that the answer --

4

you were quite right that oftentimes the validity issue

5

and infringement issue are intertwined and you have to

6

interpret the claims, and that's something which has to be

7

done in any event.

8

9

And if that is not done, and is not done
properly, it's part of what we think has occurred here,

10

what happens is that you begin to meld the issues

11

together, and it does affect the thinking, and so I think

12

that that certainly has to be done.

13

And it is a rare case in which a declaratory

14

judgment count is not there, so in terms of result we're

15

probably not talking about a lot of cases, but in terms of

16

approach, what I submit is that the Blonder-Tongue

17

decision requires a consideration of validity when the

18

trial court exercises discretion to decide that issue,

19

whether it's decided valid or not.

20

And I think anything short of that would be a

21

retreat from the sort of principles that were nec -- that

22

were, excuse me, enunciated in Blonder-Tongue, and I think

23

that what we've seen, that the concern about the safeguard

24

over the 20 years, has certainly been something that has

25

been put to rest.

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)
MR. COONS:

10

I think you're right, that's hearsay.

But I think that we're -- from my

11

point of view, that one of the things that frankly I have

12

not found any precedent that is squarely on point, but

13

it's the issue of, we have Article 3 case or controversy,

14

we have prudential mootness, and we have mootness being

15

thrown around oftentimes a little bit loosely, and I

16

submit that a court such as the Court of Appeals for the

17

Federal Circuit, which is not a court of last resort,

18

cannot itself, by its own action, create either

19

jurisdictional mootness, nor can it create prudential

20

mootness.

21

If prudential mootness occurs in a situation

22

where it's a happenstance through some extrinsic fact,

23

something which was in dispute, a report, or whatever, was

24

issued, a bankruptcy plan which has already gone so far

1

provide relief, those are the sorts of prudential mootness

2

issues that come up.

3

But there is no situation in which a court which

4

is not a court of last resort can by its own action create

5

a situation in which the case is moot, whether you look at

6

that as jurisdictionally moot or as prudentially moot, and

7

I think that that perhaps is where the error came into

8

play.

9

I think that the only thing that I would - -

10

additional point that I would like to make is that you

11

look at this from the standpoint of the patent owner, and

12

part of the problem when you have the Federal Circuit

13

practice is what has occurred here.

14

You have one half of an opportunity to litigate,

15

which is accorded to Morton in the Argus case, you have

16

one-half of an opportunity to litigate which was accorded

17

in the Cardinal case, and the problem is that this is one

18

situation in which one-half of an opportunity and one-

19

half of an opportunity does not end up to be one full

20

opportunity, that one-half of an opportunity may satisfy

21

the cynical patent owner who only wants to save his or her

22

patents, but that same one-half of an opportunity only

23

serves to wholly frustrate a responsible patent owner as

24

Morton, who believes an erroneous trial court decision was

25

reached and would like to have that rectified on appeal.

Thank you, Mr. Coons.

Mr. Schill,

4

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES F. SCHILL

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SCHILL:

6

I think I would just like to make

7

two points.

First, the presumption of validity that's

8

been discussed seems to be imbued with some substantive

9

right by Morton.

It really is only a procedural device to

10

put the burden of proof of invalidity on the person

11

attacking the patent, and I think that should be kept in

12

mind when you're deciding whether there is some kind of

13

unfairness of not deciding that issue, or deciding

14

invalidity and then not going on to reach the merits.

15

The difference we have with Morton is that if

16

the counterclaim, or if the invalidity is raised only as

17

an affirmative defense, we don't believe the Court

18

necessarily must reach that issue, and in conclusion, I

19

believe that we would request this Court to remand the

20

case to the Federal Circuit with the direction that they

21

reach the issue of validity and reach the merits

22

substantively on that issue.
