ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

1

We'll hear argument

MR. COYNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This Court has held repeatedly that use of the

12

litigation process as an anticompetitive weapon, as

13

opposed to use of the outcome of that process, violates

14

the antitrust laws.

15

The question today is whether in drawing the

16

line between legitimate and illegitimate uses of the

17

judicial process a court can refuse to consider highly

18

relevant evidence of intent under the Ninth Circuit's

19

baselessness standard.

20

files admitting that the only reason a case was brought

21

was to drive a competitor out of the market through the

22

cost of the litigationprocess,

23

would not be admissable or even discoverable.

25

Even a memorandum in a party's

I would like to establish today three points.

brought to burden, to harass, to intimidate, to impose

2

costs upon a competitor regardless of the outcome of the

3

judicial process, violates the antitrust laws.

4

Second, the Ninth Circuit's baselessness test

5

strips these important antitrust concerns of any realistic

6

level of protection.

7

yet still use the judicial process improperly to harm

8

competition.

9

these predatory cases in spite of the antitrust injury

A case can be more than baseless,

The Ninth Circuit standard would immunize

What precise intent would you say was

sufficient here, Mr. Coyne?
MR. COYNE:

Chief Justice, it's the intent to

20

use the process itself to harm competition as distinct

21

from the intent to achieve a judicial outcome as an

22

anticompetitive tool.

23

QUESTION:

And do you think -- what about a

24

mixed motive case where you're rummaging through a

25

corporation's files?

You come across one thing that says

MR. COYNE:

Virtually every case is going to be

a case of mixed motive.

anticompetitive intent, as we have to in this case, then

the predator is going to accept the kill.

So, there's going to always be a

What the trier of fact has to do is consider all

10

of the evidence of intent and reach a finding on whether

11

it was motivated by an attempt to abuse the process as

12

opposed to achieve the outcome.

3

QUESTION:

And that's the end of the case.

Is

4

that -- one way or another, whether the case is baseless

5

or not or whatever the outcome, intent is the sole and

6

only determiner.

7

MR. COYNE:

No, Justice White.

We don't believe

8

that intent is the sole determinant.

There are a number

9

of factors this Court has looked at over the years.

In

20

Allied Tube it identified the context, the source, the

21

nature of the petition.

22

looked directly at the intent with which it's brought.

23

also looked at the use of misrepresentations, unethical

24

means before the Court.

25

on the element of intent, the issue is intent as to the

2

means versus intent as to the outcome.
QUESTION:

3
4

Well, when you look at all the

factors, what are you trying to decide?
MR. COYNE:

5

You're trying to decide whether the

6

litigant, the plaintiff, in the underlying lawsuit

7

genuinely intended to be exercising a First Amendment

8

right.

13

QUESTION:

So, you say that intent in the end is

the determining factor.
MR. COYNE:

In the way this case is presented to

the courts -- Court, absolutely, yes, it is.
QUESTION:

And so, if they don't have any intent

14

-- considering all the factors, if there was no intent to

15

harm competition, that's the end of the case.

16

MR. COYNE:

17

competition at all?

19

MR. COYNE:

If there were no intent to harm

Yes.
Certainly, but that's not this case,

the case was or even if it was won.

MR. COYNE:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. COYNE:

Assuming that fact -Yes.
-- yes, there would be no basis to

5

inject a sham argument. . But here the district court did

6

not allow any discovery into the issue of intent.

7

presented on a motion for summary judgment on the issue of

8

sham, and the petitioner is entitled to the finding on

9

that -- in that setting, that there is an overall

10

It was

anticompetitive intent, an intent to harm competition.

11

QUESTION:

You --

12

QUESTION:

You take the view that if there were

3

a properly conducted, successful lawsuit, but with --

4

conducted with improper motives, that that is covered by

5

the Sherman Act.

6

MR. COYNE:

7

QUESTION:

21
22

Yes, Justice O'Connor, we do.
Is that not protected by the First

Amendment?
MR. COYNE:
QUESTION:

It -There's no First Amendment right to

bring a lawsuit if you're indifferent to the outcome?
MR. COYNE:

If you are indifferent to the

23

outcome, no.

What the First Amendment protects in terms

24

of the right to petition is just that, petitioning the

25

Government for redress of a grievance.

If this case was

brought for some ulterior motive, it is not a genuine

2

petition and there is no First Amendment right to

3

vindicate.

4

QUESTION:

Well, there's a difference --

5

QUESTION:

Have we held that the First Amendment

6

7

protects the right to bring a lawsuit?
MR. COYNE:

8

to bring a lawsuit.

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. COYNE:

The First Amendment protects a right

I said have we held that.
I believe that not in those terms,

11

but this Court has in Vendo and in Bill John's Restaurants

12

held that a much higher standard, almost equivalent to a

3

prior restraint standard, is necessary in the setting of

4

trying to enjoin pending litigation.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. COYNE:

7
8
9

Because of the First Amendment?
I believe that that --my reading of

the case is that it is, yes.
That standard, however, that would apply in a
prior restraint does not necessarily convert to the

20

standard that would apply to imposing liability after the

21

fact, as this Court held in Vendo and in Bill Johnson's.

22

The third principle that I would like to leave

23

the Court with today is that an inquiry into subjective

24

intent is workable.

25

2

consumers, concerns about economic freedom.

3

antitrust concerns go far beyond the concerns that inform

5

fairness to litigants.

theory, every case, as I think you suggested a moment ago,

2

is going to end up as a mixed motive case.

3

strongest argument that the mental state must be one of

4

indifference to success, which is rather a different thing

5

from simply saying ulterior motive or mixed motive?

7

MR. COYNE:

Yes, it is.

Isn't your

That is the standard

that we urged in our brief.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. COYNE:

Yes.
On reflecting further on it, what

10

may be a more workable standard for the Court is to

11

examine it on a but-for basis; namely, if the case would

12

not have been brought but for the predatory motive

13

separating out the legitimate petitioning motive from the

14

predatory motive, if it were not brought but for the

15

predatory motive, that case would never have been brought

16

at all legitimately.

The courts are going to determine

QUESTION:

21

MR. COYNE:

Depending on the --- question of motivation?
Depending on the development of the

22

record, Justice Scalia, yes, there are situations where

23

the court would be well within its province to dispose of

24

the case if there were presumptions created, for example,

25

a nonbaseless case that was successful below.

QUESTION:

Right.

It was successful.

So, we'd say, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

after awarding damages, whether you award it or not, you

should then ask yourself in view of this counterclaim that

6

this is predatory - -

7

MR. COYNE:

8

QUESTION:

9

No, Justice.
-- whether this suit would have been

brought but for the fact that it is harming a competitor.
MR. COYNE:

10

Not every case would go to that

11

stage.

If the facts, as I just outlined, for example, a

12

nonbaseless, successful suit below --

MR. COYNE:

allowed and there were no evidence -- there was no

evidence developed that the case was predatorily

19

motivated, we would agree.

case should not -- that presumption should not be

21

rebuttal, but the district judge would be within his

22

province to grant summary judgment in that setting.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

We think that doctrinally that

When does anybody bring suit against

a competitor without hoping to harm the competitor?
MR. COYNE:

Well, I would imagine very rarely.

I mean, once there's discovery, there will be

something to say, boy, we're really going to get him in

this suit.

It will be terrific.
MR. COYNE:

Stated that broadly, petitioners

don't agree.

germane to this issue is the evidence with which --

regarding the intent behind this petition was it brought

with a genuine intent to achieve the outcome that is being

offered by the courts or, was it brought for some

predatory motive to harass or intimidate.

14

QUESTION:

Well, you're changing your testimony.

You had a but-for test.

15

MR. COYNE:

My suggestion is that the standard

is whether the intent is genuine.

courts is the most workable.

consider all of the relevant evidence on that issue of

intent.

how to handle these cases.

9

It's simply more focused and I believe

If the issue is indifference, what we were
articulating is it's indifference between your pure motive

and your evil motive.

You could have a case where it

could pose problems under the first Amendment, which is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PINCUS:

3
4

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

5

It's important at the outset, we believe, to

6

focus on the precise nature of the question before the

7

Court in this case.

8

Noerr doctrine, you're interpreting the Sherman Act

9

because Noerr and its progeny make clear that that

In determining the contours of the

10

doctrine rests squarely on a construction of the Sherman

11

Act.

14

MR. PINCUS:

Noerr doesn't even mention the First

Well, it mentions -- actually in a

15

footnote, it states that the Court isn't reaching the

16

First Amendment question --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. PINCUS:

19

Yes.
-- because it's resting its

decision on statutory interpretation grounds.

20

In - - and in construing this particular statute,

21

the Court has broader latitude than it does in the typical

22

statutory interpretation case because when Congress

23

enacted the Sherman Act, it gave the courts broad

24

responsibility for giving content to the statute's broad

25

mandate by formulating rules of liability.

So, we think the appropriate methodology here is

1

2

clear. ; The Court should weigh the costs and the benefits

3

of the contending rules and select the one that best

4

reconciles the general goals of the Sherman Act with the

5

particular purposes of Noerr immunity, and we think that

6

the court of appeals did just that and that its rule is

7

the appropriate one.
Now, Mr. Coyne has said something about the

8

9

benefits of petitioners' approach in terms of the supposed

10

enhancement of antitrust enforcement, and it certainly is

11

possible to hypothesize examples of conduct that would be

12

captured by petitioners' rule, but would be exempt from

3

antitrust liability under the standard adopted by the

4

court of appeals.
But we think that Justice Stevens' remark about

5
6

probability hit the nail on the head.

7

weight to give to these hypothetical possibilities, it's

8

important to recognize just how unlikely the conduct that

9

petitioners have hypothesized is in the real world.

In considering what

What

20

is required is a lawsuit that petitioners could win but

21

have no interest in winning.

prosecuted at least in part to achieve that goal.

And maybe I don't have the case in mind.

6

Isn't this a case in which there are several large

7

companies that are in the business of distributing motion

pictures all allegedly got together to accomplish this

9

policy objective?

It's not the simple case of a normal

10

single owner of one copyright trying to enforce that

copyright.

12

which there's other evidence which might at least be

13

consistent with some kind of an antitrust conspiracy.

14

So, the problem is limited to the case in

MR. PINCUS:

Well, although I think in the

copyright context, you could premise it just on a single

person with a legitimate claim of a copyright
infringement, you're always going to be imposing
litigation costs on him.

That's in - - unless you say, by

the way, to avoid a sham claim around here, I'm going to
pay your legal bills.
(Laughter.)
MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, I think that's

exactly the problem with petitioners' standard is that in
every single case - QUESTION:

Well, it sounds just like that's your

problem too.
MR. PINCUS:

Well, except the only way we can

enforce our copyright rights are in court.

These --

they're not rights that are enforceable through selfhelp, and that's why the courts have recognized the
special need to allow a forum for legitimate copyright
claims.

And under petitioners' standard, where subjective

intent is the only question, a person with a legitimate - stipulated to have legitimate motivation and a winning
claim wouldn't know what was going to happen at the end of

It's the intent -- well, as the

disrupt the defendants in the initial lawsuit, the

9

defendants' business relationships, solely through the

QUESTION:

there's a mixed motivation, where the intention is to

burden the other side through the governmental process,

5

through the outcome of the governmental process, as well

as through the process itself, that mixed motivation case

7

is a case that's protected under Noerr.

8

Court squarely held in Noerr because it was clear in that

case that the intention of the lobbying was both to win a

victory in the legislature and also through the publicity

campaign to directly injure the business of the

QUESTION:

That is what the

Well, you say also, but before you

get to intent under your standard, you have to cross an

MR. PINCUS:

Exactly, Your Honor, and we think

7

that -- the reason for that is that when we're weighing

8

the costs and the benefits of the contending standards, as

9

I was saying, the cost in terms of antitrust -- lessening

20

of antitrust enforcement in requiring an objective test is

21

quite low because, as Mr. Coyne said, virtually every case

22

is going to be a mixed motive case.

Is there a difference between your test and

baseless, then there's an inquiry into subjective intent.

4

And if the requisite subjective intent is found, the

5

intent only to inflict harm through the process, as

opposed to the result, then Noerr immunity doesn't apply

and the litigation can be the basis for antitrust

Your Honor, I don't think it's

I think repetitive lawsuits might well be another

kind of objective indicia.

QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. PINCUS:

But the courts -- the lower -- it's

interesting that the lower courts have interpreted that to
permit proof of purpose only through objective misconduct.
A number of courts -- and I can cite to the Court the
Ninth Circuit's decision in the Townsend case, which is
reported at 929 F.2d at 1138.

This issue didn't come up

in the briefing - - is a case where the court said in order
to prevent chill, we're going to only -- we're not going
to allow inquiry into the minds of the other side.

We're

going to look to the objective facts, and if through those
objective facts improper purpose can be demonstrated, then
we'll impose liability.

But they adopt the very kind of

objective standard that we're urging in this case and that
the Ninth Circuit found in this case,

to prevent this

murky intent inquiry that will chill legitimate conduct.
QUESTION:

I guess we haven't handed down

anything on that point.
MR. PINCUS:

You -- this Court has not addressed

it, but I think the Court's decision in the Harlow case is
very instructive because that was a situation in which the
Court had,

for official immunity, adopted a standard that

required - - in order for immunity to apply, both an
objective and a subjective test had to be satisfied.
Subjective good faith was required.

And the Court in

1

Harlow reformulated the standard precisely because the

2

subjective inquiry was too burdensome and was chilling

3

legitimate conduct, and we think that's exactly why it's

4

the right way to go here because there will be the same

5

kind of chill on legitimate activity.
QUESTION:

6

On the other hand, there isn't a

7

whole lot of social utility in allowing lawsuits for the

8

sole purpose of causing business injury.

9

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, but that's not

10

the conduct that's being protected by an objective

11

standard.

12

legitimate conduct that is being chilled by the fear of

3

The conduct that's being projected is the

liability.

4

Maybe I should turn to the chilling.

5

QUESTION:

Before you do, if we agree that mixed

6

motive is a safe harbor, we're really not arguing about a

7

whole lot, are we, because if it is above the baseless

8

level, there will almost always be a mixed motive?

9

mean, it's hard to imagine a case where you have a good

I

20

shot at getting a recovery and yet you didn't care at all

21

about it.

22

mean, once you agree that mixed motive is okay, it doesn't

23

make a whole lot of difference whether you say -- go along

with you or go along with your opponent except that going

along with you forecloses the issue a lot earlier.

Your only motive was to get the guy.

I think it avoids significant

burdens on the people with legitimate motives and

legitimate claims.

designed to do, and that's exactly what the Court's

5

jurisprudence in a host in a First Amendment areas -- for

example, in New York Times against Sullivan, the Court

required falsity.

falsity and required -- precisely because it wanted to

protect truthful, legitimate conduct.

10

And that's exactly what Noerr was

In other cases, the Court has required

And I think that's

exactly what's going on here.
But I think you're right, Justice Scalia, and I

11
12

think to retreat from mixed motive would be a very

13

dramatic change in the Court's jurisprudence in this area

14

because Noerr squarely holds that mixed motives are

15

protected.

16

the antitrust enforcement benefits of petitioners' rule

17

are negligible because those animals just don't exist.

And I agree with you.

May I just ask one other question?

19

Normally, is this the only overt act in furtherance of the

20

alleged conspiracy -- conspiracy alleged in the complaint,

21

the pleadings, bringing the baseless lawsuit?

22

MR. PINCUS:

There were other acts that were

23

alleged, but the Ninth Circuit held that petitioners had

24

not shown antitrust injury as to those, and they didn't

25

seek certiorari as to that determination.

18

I think there's a danger in inferring bad intent -- what

19

Noerr makes bad intent from anticompetitive - - alleged

But I agree with

In the present case, it's hard to see the problem.
But let me turn to what I think should be

most significantly the very, very heavy burden that would

one that is still an ultimate intent standard.

it basically says is that in deciding what the actual

should be given to objective factors, which I don't think

Would you characterize it as a

think they think, for example, in this case the pleading

that there are presumptions that guide the fact finder in

evidence is on the antisham side of the ledger, that it
may be very difficult for an antitrust plaintiff to obtain

But they rely on the regular apparatus for

uncertain protection for people who are ex ante deciding

what's going to happen down the line, whether the district

It's extremely uncertain.
And we think that really does not provide the

because the common law analogs, if you will, to this
