ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY L. GARDNER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. GARDNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this employment discrimination case

12

alleging racial discrimination in demotion and discharge

13

is whether a district court is compelled as a matter of

14

law, because of a finding of pretext, to enter a

15

for the employee even though he found as a matter of fact

16

that there was no intentional discrimination and

17

as a matter of fact there was no intentional

18

discrimination.

19

judgment

believed

The answer to that question is no because, as

20

this Court said in Aikens, once legitimate,

21

nondiscriminatory reasons have been articulated for the

22

employment decision, no

23

of fact must make a factual determination about whether

24

there was intentionaldiscrimination

25

or not.

Aikens rejected a rigid, mechanistic, and

ritualistic method of factfinding, a method that I think

2

would straitjacket factfinders and actually obstruct the

3

truth-seeking process.

4

method appearing on page 18 of the employee's brief on the

5

merits, a method -- a diagram type method which typifies a

6

rigid approach to factfinding, which should not be taken

7

in employment discrimination cases.

QUESTION:

This --

Can I ask you one thing?

If the

employer in a case like this, after a prima facie case has

10

been made, just remains quiet or he doesn't offer any

11

allegedly neutral ground, is the plaintiff entitled to

12

judgment then?

13

^

If rejected a method like the

MR. GARDNER:

In the usual case he is, Your

14

Honor, because in the usual case, there's no evidence at

15

all of any nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge.

16

QUESTION:

Well, and if the employer offers on

17

its face a neutral reason and the plaintiff fails to prove

18

that it's a farce, the case is over.

19

MR. GARDNER:

20

QUESTION:

21

That would mean the employer then is

entitled to judgment.
MR. GARDNER:

22

23

Well, if the employer --

If the plaintiff fails to prove

But if the plaintiff proves pretext

MR. GARDNER:

5

QUESTION:

Well, you think he's -- it's not

6

7

the employer had stayed quiet.

8

■v

The case is not over.

He's in worse position than he would have been if

MR. GARDNER:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

I

9

can imagine some situations where the employer is silent

10

in response to the prima facie case, but the case is not

11

over because there are some situations where the evidence

12

of the prima facie case may also contain in it evidence of

13

a nondiscriminatory reason, as the evidence in this case

14

in the evidence of pretext contained in it a

15

nondiscriminatory reason.

16

QUESTION:

Well, supposing the employer, after

17

the prima facie case is made, testifies that my reason for

18

firing the person was not discriminatory.

19

so.

20

nondiscriminatory reason, but the finder of fact isn't

21

required to believe the employer when it comes to the

22

ultimate decision, is he?

23

It was thus and

Well, that certainly is evidence CT a

MR. GARDNER:

No, he's not, and he's not

24

required to believe the employee.

2

decide which one it really believes is the actual motive

3

of the employer.

4

QUESTION:

Does your opponent agree, do you

5

think, that the district court in this case found as a

6

fact that the reason for the discharge was not

7

discrimination on the basis of race?

8

10
11
12

MR. GARDNER:

I believe my opponent does not

agree with that finding of the district court.
QUESTION:

But does he agree that the district

court made that finding?
MR. GARDNER:

Yes, he does.

That was a finding

13

of fact that the district court made after he weighed all

14

the evidence, after he made credibility determinations,

15

and he found that there was no intentional discrimination

16

because there was evidence before him which undermined any

17

inference of intentional discrimination and which revealed

18

a motive for the employment decision other than the

19

employee's motive or the employer's prerffered motive.

20

QUESTION:

But he -- did he -- did the district

21

trial court find pretext that the offered reason was

22

pretextual?

23

MR. GARDNER:

Yes, he did.

He found that the --

24

his words were that the proffered reason was not the

25

actual reason.

He did not accept, however, the employee's

QUESTION:

So, then an employer is really well

advised to come up with a pretextual reason as your

opponents says in his brief.

Not so, Your Honor.

Well, if you stand silent, you lose.

MR. GARDNER:

QUESTION:

In the usual prima facie case.

Right.
But an employer's --

So, better to come up with -- once

14

you come up with some pretext, you don't necessarily lose.

15

Then the factfinder can decide, well, even though this was

16

a pretext, and even though there was a prima facie case,

17

nonetheless, I just don't basically believe that there was

18

racial discrimination going on here.

19

MR. GARDNER:

An employer should never come up

20

with a pretextual reason.

21

do so because --

QUESTION:

It's never in his interest to

Why not?

He has got nothing to lose

on your theory.

Yes, he does.

MR. GARDNER:

1

An inference of improper motive

2

discrimination can be drawn from the finding of pretext.

3

That's the common sense rule -- part of the rule of

4

McDonnell Douglas.

5

QUESTION:

But at least you'd have a finding.

6

At least you'd have a factfinder who could make a finding;

7

whereas, if he doesn't come up with a pretext, the game is

8

over.

9

The prima facie case governs.

There's no finding possible you tell us.

MR. GARDNER:

10

Right?

Well, that's in the situation of

11

the usual prima facie case which eliminates all or most

12

common reasons for an action.

14

stage or in the prima facie stage of the case, presented

evidence of a motive other than discrimination and other

than the employer's proffered reason --

reason for the discharge.

3

MR. GARDNER:

QUESTION:

I'm saying that, yes.

So, does that not mean that your

client was entitled to a - - have the case dismissed at the

6

end of the plaintiff's case?

QUESTION:

10

He should have never been able to

make a prima facie case.
MR. GARDNER:

No, Your Honor, because there was

a finding of pretext.

11

It's difficult --

12

QUESTION:

No.

But no, no, no, no, no.

I'm

13

suggesting that you didn't even reach the need to

14

determine whether there was pretext if you're correct.

15

the plaintiff's own evidence provided the basis for

16

finding an alternative ground for discharge, you should

17

have prevailed on a motion to dismiss at the close of the

18

plaintiff's case.

MR. GARDNER:

If

I agree with ySU if we were able

20

to -- if we are able to distinguish in these trials when

21

the prima facie case stage ends, when the rebuttal of that

begins, and when that ends.

Did you make a motion to dismiss at

the close of the plaintiff's case?

MR. GARDNER:

QUESTION:

I did.

The district court --

And it was denied, but then

10

eventually you won because it should not have been denied

11

is what you're saying.

12

MR. GARDNER:

13

If we can distinguish in the steps

of the case.

14

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Gardner, even though --

15

when you proceed here -- when a plaintiff proceeds and

16

makes out a prima facie case, the plaintiff does that by

17

showing the plaintiff was fired, that he was qualified as

18

an employee, and that someone of another race was hired

19

instead.

Right?

^

20

MR. GARDNER:

21

QUESTION:

I mean, that's what we have here.

22

That's a typical case.

23

MR. GARDNER:

24

QUESTION:

25

Right.

That's the usual prima facie case.

Now, at the so-called end of the

plaintiff's case, even if this other evidence may emerge

1

that, well, there was some animosity here, even though it

2

isn't a mandatory presumption at that stage, there still

3

are inferences to be drawn, are there not, from the

4

plaintiff's evidence that he was fired, that he was

5

qualified, that someone of another race was hired instead?

6

MR. GARDNER:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So, I mean, how would he ever be

8

entitled to summary judgment even though some of other

9

evidence had emerged?

10

I mean, it still is a fact question

to be determined by the trier of fact.

11

MR. GARDNER:

12

QUESTION:

I agree with you.

And there's some evidentiary value to

13

that evidence whether or not it's applied in a mandatory

14

sense.

15

MR. GARDNER:

I agree with you.

Once there is

the employee may still prevail if the district court

In this particular

So, you weren't entitled to summary

You just take witnesses to tell kind

down, and then the employer come and testify, and then the

employee came again and testify.

QUESTION:

The first witness, Mr.

Mr. Gardner, what is the effect of

the prima facie case?

15

dilemma that the other side says exists if the effect of

16

the prima facie case is not to entitle the employee to

judgment if there's no response from the employer, no

19

employee to get to the factfinder.

20

survives your motion to dismiss, but the fact -- which

21

means the factfinder may find in favor of the employee,

22

but perhaps the prima facie case does not mean that the

factfinder must find in favor of the employee.

It's rebutted by something that the defendant did

Isn't that right?

MR. GARDNER:

Well, the pretext -- the finding

14

of pretext was rebutted by the personal animosity, but

15

once the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason has been

16

proffered, there's no more presumption which operates.

17

becomes solely then weighing evidence and credibility

determinations and then going to the fact of whether there

has been proof of intentional discrimination.
QUESTION:

20

It

Well, if you wanted to fit this more

21

tightly into the McDonnell Douglas framework, if that were

22

thought necessary, I suppose you could say that the

judge's finding that the discharge resulted from personal

24

animus was a finding of a nonpretextual reason for the

25

discharge.

That was the factual reason in the view of the

judge.
MR. GARDNER:

2

It would be a nonpretextual reason

3

in the sense that if one equates pretext with intentional

4

discrimination, it would be a nonpretextual reason.

5

district court did not look at it that way.

6

court equated pretext with just not the actual reason and

7

looked at all of the explanations which it had before it

8

from the two parties and from the third reason to

9

determine what the actual reason was.
QUESTION:

10

11

appeals didn't really review the district court finding of

MR. GARDNER:

21

I think you do know that for two

22

reasons.

One, the testimony from Mr. Hicks himself and

his witness about the personal animosity.

it was that his supervisor admitted to him that he was

25

trying to make him fight.

After the plaintiff rested, the

That evidence is --

10

there was a full scale changeover in the supervisory

11

personnel in the institution.

12

but the institution was so poorly run that four of the six

13

supervisors were gone.

14

There were six supervisors,

Mr. Hicks was not one of the four.

But even though there is this changeover in the

15

institution as a whole, the number of blacks employed at

16

the beginning of a calendar year was the same as at the

17

end of the calendar year.

18

blacks hired and fired was approximately equal.

So, the fact that

excluded other black employees who actually committed the

It's always in the employer's

I mean, I get the impression from hearing your

co-counsel and you as if at each point after a witness

testified in one of these cases, the counsel must stand up

and say, well, now this witness proved this, and that's

MR. DuMONT:

No, not at all, Your Honor.

We

11

think that the functional test here is the test that

12

Burdine sets out which is a reasonably clear and specific

13

articulation by the defendant of particular reasons why it

14

took its action to meet the prima facie case and then a

15

full and fair opportunity for the plaintiff to contest

16

those reasons.

17

Now, they can emerge at any time during the

18

trial.

They do have to be reasonably specifically

19

articulated, but it might happen during the trial.

20

might happen on - - out of something that came out of the

21

plaintiff's evidence, but we do think that the defendant

22

would be required to step up to the plate and accept

23

whatever reasons he's planning to rely on.

Well, if in fact the defendant

accuracy.

way civil trials usually proceed.
