ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM K. KELLEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. KELLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether

12

respondent's application for attorney's fees under the

13

Equal Access to Justice Act was filed on time.

14

J

PROCEEDINGS

15

The case involves the interplay between two
statutes, section 2412(d) of EAJA, and 42 United States

16

Code, section 405(g), which is the provision in the Social

17

Security Act that gives unsuccessful applicants for

18

benefits a right to bring a cause of action challenging

19

that decision in district court.

20

Respondent in this case applied for benefits,

21

and his claim was denied at all levels of the

22

administrative process.

23

pursuant to section 405(g) in district court.

24
25

He then filed a civil action

made a mistake and reversed the decision denying

against Finkelstein and Melkonyan against Sullivan confirm

2

our reading of the statute as correct.

3

the Court held that sentence four remands constitute a

4

final judgment and that such judgments are appealable.

5

that decision, the Court said that any action a court

6

takes under sentence four must include a judgment, whether

7

or not a remand is included as well.

MR. KELLEY:

In Finkelstein, Justice Scalia,

18

that very argument was made, and the Court rejected that

19

point saying that regardless of the label the district

20

court attaches to its order, it is a judgment and it is

21

final and effective as such.

the court says so or not.

Yes, otherwise a court would simply

1

Now, sentence six of section 405(g) stands in

2

contrast to sentence four, for in that sentence Congress

3

gave district courts the authority to remand cases without

4

entering judgment and also to require the Secretary to

5

return to district court after the remand for further

6

proceedings in district court, at which point a judgment

7

would then be entered.

8

9

The unanimous opinion a year later in Melkonyan
confirmed -- further confirms our reading here.

In

10

Melkonyan, the Court said explicitly that section 405(g)

11

only authorizes district courts to act pursuant to the

12

procedures of sentence four or sentence six.

13

room in that statute for a hybrid procedure, such as the

14

one respondent urges here.

15

QUESTION:

There is no

Well, now, Mr. Kelley, I think that

16

in the Hudson case, which was the first, that the

17

Government conceded there was no final judgment for Equal

18

Access to Justice Act purposes until the administrative

19

proceeding on remand was concluded.

20

MR. KELLEY:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

21

We did concede that in that case.

QUESTION:

Well, Melkonyan certainly said it

wasn't overturning Hudson.

1

Melkonyan referred to Hudson as encompassing a narrow

2

class of cases.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. KELLEY:

And our submission is that Hudson

5

applies only in sentence six cases because under the terms

6

of sentence four, as the Court interpreted that sentence

7

in Finkelstein and Melkonyan subsequent to Hudson, the

8

Court has concluded that there is no such jurisdiction.

9

QUESTION:

And just what is it you think that

10

one of these Social Security claimants should do who wants

11

to have an EAJA claim?

12

J

On sentence six.

I mean, it's -- there has to be some way to work

13

this out.

14

claimants, if the Government's position was substantially

15

unjustified, are going to recover their costs.

16

how is it you think this is going to work?

17

Congress intended under EAJA that these

MR. KELLEY:

We quite agree that Congress

18

intended applicants who succeed in litigation against the

19

Government and obtain benefits in which in our case -- our

20

position was not substantially justified to get benefits.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

And the time of the remand, they

don't know whether they're going to obtain benefits.
MR. KELLEY:

That is quite true, and that

24

problem is easily solved, we would submit, simply by

25

filing an application at the time Congress has required

person is a prevailing party and resolved at that time.

QUESTION:

That application can

It can also be held in abeyance for

5

the duration of life on this planet so far as the statute

6

is concerned.

7

that, you have no time limit disciplining the point at

8

which the claimant has got to come in for the fees?

Isn't the problem there that if you do

9

MR. KELLEY:

I don't believe that is a problem,

10

Justice Souter, for this reason.

11

proceedings on remand have been finished, has every

12

incentive to rush back to district court for his fees.

The claimant, after

13

And I would also point out that under

14

respondent's view there is similarly a problem of no time
limit.

Under respondent's submission, the burden is on

15

16

either the Secretary or the claimant to go back to

17

district court at some unspecified time, without time

18

limit, after the remand proceedings are completed and

19

obtain a judgment.

20

QUESTION:

Well, that may be, but there's a

21

third possibility in which the claimant who cannot at the

22

point of remand certify that he is entitled as a winner,

23

that the claimant, in effect, is going to take the benefit

24

of the tolling of the statute until the prevailing -- his

25

prevailing party status is clear, and then the 30 days

runs.
MR. KELLEY:

Well, that's precisely -- in

effect, I should say, precisely the submission the Court
rejected in Melkonyan, which is that matters should stand
in abeyance until the proceedings on remand are finished
and the decision of the administrative agency will
demonstrate whether the party is a prevailing party, and
the time period should then start then.

That -- the Court

rejected that position of the Government in that case
unanimously.
And it seems to me that that position would have
workability problems as well because it would be -- it
will be an inchoate time which --at which the fee
application would be due.

Congress made a very deliberate

decision here to put a strict 30-day limit -QUESTION:

inchoate time.

Why would it be -- I'm sorry.

No,

I was going to say why would it be an
I mean, you'd have to determine it in

relation to the conclusion of the administrative
proceeding.
MR. KELLEY:

I suppose that is correct, and

perhaps I misspoke, but the point remains that the Court
in Melkonyan concluded that that very regime was
unauthorized by the statutes.

The Court in Melkonyan said

that EAJA requires the time period to be measured from the

judgment of a court.
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Kelley, if we're talking

3

about what EAJA requires, it -- the provision says within

4

30 days of final judgment, the party seeking the award

5

shall submit to the court an application for fees, not

6

just an application for fees, but an application which

7

shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible

8

to receive an award under this subsection and the amount

sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney

10

or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of

11

13

done because he won't know what his attorney's fees are.

14

MR. KELLEY:

That can't

Oh, but he will, Justice Scalia.

At that point, he will know how much time and money has

16

been spent in litigation, and --

MR. KELLEY:

In the district court.

But -- well,

20

you do not contend then that he's entitled to any of the

21

fees from what occurs on remand.

22

MR. KELLEY:

We contend that he is not entitled

23

to such fees in sentence four cases if Hudson is limited

24

as we have submitted.

25

that fashion, however, it is a small matter.

Even if Hudson is not limited in

QUESTION:

Well, then why do you have to wait?

2

Why do you -- oh, you have to wait for the completion of

3

the proceedings below not in order to get the fees, but

4

simply to be sure that he's the prevailing party.

5

MR. KELLEY:

6

QUESTION:

I see.

7

QUESTION:

That's a real limitation on Hudson.

That's exactly right.
I see.

8

Hudson was, in fact, despite what we said in Melkonyan, a

9

sentence four remand, wasn't it?

10
11
12

13
14

MR. KELLEY:

It has never been adjudicated as

such, but we agree that it was, yes.
QUESTION:

And --

And that case held the litigant was

entitled to fees for the agency proceedings, didn't it?
MR. KELLEY:

The case did so hold, and we would

15

submit that the Court's subsequent decisions in

16

Finkelstein and Melkonyan have demonstrated that the

17

statutory authorization for the district court to retain

18

jurisdiction in the manner the Hudson court contemplated

19

is limited to sentence six cases.

QUESTION:

Is that a sub silentio overruling of

Well, I don't believe it's an

overruling, Justice Kennedy.

MR. KELLEY:

Well, it's quite clear we believe,

Justice White, that initially that is certainly true.

United States Code, section 504(c) governs fees for

within that 30 days, when you have to appeal the final

2

judgment, simultaneously have at hand the amount of your

fees.

4

That's what it assumes
MR. KELLEY:

Well, it assumes that you will know

5

what amount of fees you are entitled to to that point, but

it is not a known in the law -- and we do not believe it

makes a mishmash of subsection (b) to supplement a fee

QUESTION:

In fact, the fee

Well, Mr. Kelley, the First Circuit

and the Eighth Circuit have a different view, don't they?

14

MR. KELLEY:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, they do, Justice O'Connor.
And what's the matter with that view?

16

They presume an intent in the district court to retain

17

jurisdiction unless there is some express indication to

18

the contrary.

19

MR. KELLEY:

The problem with that position we

20

believe that it is inconsistent both with section 405(g)

21

and the terms of sentence four and sentence eight and with

22

this Court's decisions in Finkelstein and Melkonyan.

23

Finkelstein, the Court held that a sentence four action by

24

a district court had to be a judgment and that that

25

judgment terminates the civil action.

9

That is true.

I would suppose it is conceivable,

but - -

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. KELLEY:

It's kind of odd.
We believe it is odd, and the Court

14

in Finkelstein rejected our -- I'm sorry -- declined to

adopt our alternate submission under the collateral order

16

doctrine which would more readily lend itself to one side

appealing and not the other.

18

But in any event, we don't think that it matters

19

whether the claimant can appeal a sentence four judgment

20

because a claimant who has reason to appeal has no reason

21

to file a fee application ordinarily.

a fee application -- the fee application issue only arises

if the Government has had an unfavorable ruling against

it.

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

9

MR. KELLEY:

Just because he's a -- he has

He submits --

Yes.

Now,

He has to show that as well.

QUESTION:

Well, how does he show it at that

time?

18

MR. KELLEY:

The eligibility provision we

19

believe is naturally read to refer to the financial status

20

of the fee applicant, which is further down in section

21

2412(d), which is having a net worth of less than $2

million.

That is the eligibility.

then -- why couldn't a fee -- the fee be immediately

awarded?

3

MR. KELLEY:

The reason it could not be

4

immediately awarded is that under current law and as the

5

courts of appeals have held and this Court has recognized

6

in Hudson and Finkelstein, that simply obtaining a remand

is not enough to qualify one for attorney's fees.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FULLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Today the Court is presented with the question

5

whether the Equal Access to Justice statute permits a

6

Social Security disability claimant, whose case is

7

remanded from the Federal court to the Secretary for

8

further administrative proceedings, under the fourth

9

sentence of section 405(g) to file his application for

10

EAJA fees upon successful completion of the administrative

11

remand proceedings, or whether as urged by the Government,

12

every such claimant must immediately after receipt of a

13

sentence four remand file a conditional EAJA application

14

at that time.

15

We contend that the decision below of the Eighth

16

Circuit Court of Appeals granting my client, Mr. Schaefer,

17

an EAJA award in the amount of $1,372.50 should be

18

affirmed, and today I would like to focus upon the three

19

main reasons why it should be affirmed.

20

The first is that the lower court decision, in

21

accordance with nationwide practice since at least 1989,

22

is consistent with the plain terms and the intent of the

23

EAJA statute.

24
25

Secondly, considering the matter from a common
sense standpoint, our approach is much more practical and
28

1

reasonable than the unworkable solution posited by the

2

Government today.

3

Finally, the procedure that we followed in

4

asking for EAJA fees in this case was directly consistent

5

with and, indeed, may be mandated by this Court's decision

6

in Hudson.

7

QUESTION:

Well, didn't we say in one of the

8

later cases that Hudson applies only to sentence six

9

cases?

10

MR. FULLER:

I don't believe that that was said

11

at all, and Hudson in fact was a sentence four case, as

12

the Government has indicated today.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Well, did we say it applied only to

sentence four cases then?
MR. FULLER:

No.

Hudson was decided before all

16

this litigation regarding the distinction between the two.

17

Hudson simply stood for the proposition that a claimant,

18

after remand, was entitled to EAJA fees for the work

19

performed by his counsel during the remand process.

20

QUESTION:

Well, then what was the limitation on

21

Hudson in one of the - - either Melkonyan or Finkelstein?

22

I can't remember which one is was.

23

MR. FULLER:

Well, Melkonyan and Finkelstein

24

both discussed Hudson.

25

They said that Hudson was not to the contrary.

They did not overrule Hudson.

Hudson was discussing sentence six remands, not sentence

four remands?

14

MR. FULLER:

I don't think that it explicitly

said that.

16

QUESTION:

17

import of it when it says it applies to a narrow category

I would say that there has been some

confusion caused by some of the later holdings, but it's

And let's talk

about that.
Melkonyan seems to be the case which the
Government relies upon most significantly and particularly
the dicta in Melkonyan relative to sentence four remands.
Now, Melkonyan is not against us in this case because it
specifically discusses Hudson and says that Hudson is not
to the contrary.

Ours is a

just as Hudson was.

And even the dicta referring to sentence four
from Melkonyan in this case can be harmonized and
reconciled completely with our position, and the reason
for that is because under sentence four and my experience
and a reading of that sentence indicates that there are

Secretary's decision is reversed on legal grounds and sent

1

courts for failure to fulfill all of the requirements of

2

the EAJA statute, particularly the showing of prevailing

3

party status, the showing of the specific amount of fees

4

requested and so forth, could dismiss those type of

5

premature petitions as being inappropriate under the plain

6

language of the EAJA statute.

7

I think what the Government's approach invites

8

is a potential of a multiplicity of litigation and further

9

appeals and so forth dealing with what the proper filings

10

would be under a conditional type filing theory, as the

11

Government urges.

12

In addition, the amount, which Justice O'Connor

13

asked about, of needless filings that would be required.

14

If you look at our brief, we cite the 1990 statistics in

15

which there were over 4,300 remands nationwide from

16

district courts to the Secretary.

17

claimants lost on remand.

18

figures, at least 1,600 of those petitions that would have

were clogging up the district court dockets.

1

to 2,526, and the percentage of claimants which lost on

2

remand went down a little bit to about a third at that

3

time.

4

I think that he attempts to minimize the

5

nationwide impact by breaking it down to 21 or whatever

6

per judicial district when, in fact, you have to look at

7

the nationwide effect because they're not necessarily

8

spread out on an average basis among judicial districts.

9

The Secretary is concerned about delay.

Let's

10

talk about delay because they contend that, under the

11

present system and the approach urged by our side, the

12

respondent in this case, there is this great potential for

13

delay.

14

First of all, there's no evidence that claimants

15

or their counsel have been dilatory or routinely delayed

16

these type of filing.

17

concedes today, there is a tremendous incentive on the

18

part of claimants and their counsel to get these in and to

19

get the fees paid as quickly as possible.

20

In fact, even as the Secretary

Under the Government's theory, you'd have to

21

first file this conditional application for fees.

22

would then have to go back and go through the remand

23

proceedings before the Secretary, but then significantly,

24

the Government's theory contains no mechanism for

25

triggering any further time limits upon the claimant or

counsel could wait forever before coming back and having

Under their theory, assuming that there was the

Under our system, it's very simple.

6

Once the

7

administrative process is complete, the Secretary herself,

8

if she's concerned about delay, can come in and simply

9

file a motion for entry of final judgment, which will

10

automatically trigger that EAJA time limit to start

11

running.

within her own power the power to limit the untimely

applications that she fears would be coming.

Well, which would you rather have?

15

MR. FULLER:

Yes.

If I had my druthers, in the

16

perfect world I would say that the existing system should

17

continue and the reason being that when you look at

Well, yes, but just -- but also on

MR. FULLER:

QUESTION:

MR. FULLER:

In a sentence four or sentence six?
Sentence four.
Okay.

I think that we should

continue the way things are at the present time, and

25

here's why.

Because when you talk about the prevailing

Well, I'm trying not to analyze it

MR. FULLER:

Oh, you think you'll get more if you

And at the present time --

All right.

Well, but you are.

I'm trying to analyze it from the

perspective --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. FULLER:

Yes, but you are.
I'm trying to analyze it from the

13

perspective of the Social Security claimant whose fees or

14

whose abilities financially are very limited by

15

definition.

16

And the claimant is affected by the EAJA fee

17

process.

18

for example, we waited until the contingency fee was

19

fixed, the 406(b) fee, and then we came in and asked the

20

court to award the EAJA fee in addition to that so that

21

the court could compare those two fees and see --

He's affected because, as we did in our case,

So, your preference to leave the

On the basis of what's good for the

claimants, yes.
We contend in the final analysis that the system

urged by the Secretary, the change in the existing

practice, is unworkable and impractical and does not give

Justice Act.

should be affirmed and the award of EAJA fees in the

amount of $1,372.50 to my client, Mr. Schaefer, should be

affirmed.

On that basis, the lower court decision

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM K. KELLEY

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. KELLEY:

20

I have two points.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
First, we believe that our

21

approach, as set forth in the brief, accommodates the

22

language of all the relevant statutes in this Court's

23

cases, quite unlike respondent's approach.

24

Court disagrees with that, we believe it would be

25

preferable to adopt the approach suggested by Justice

The second point is as to the application of the

rules in this case, respondent's argument regarding rule

and we would urge the Court to remand the case for the
