ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. MANNING

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. MANNING:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
A divided panel of the D.C. Circuit took the

11
12

extraordinary step of invalidating a portion of an act of

13

Congress, the Cable Act of 1984, on rational basis grounds

14

under the Fifth Amendment.

15

In particular, the court rejected Congress'

16

judgment that there is less reason for imposing a

17

franchise requirement when cable facilities serve only

18

commonly owned, controlled, or managed multiple-unit

19

dwellings.

20

rational dividing line between franchised and unfranchised

21

facilities in the use of public rights-of-way.

Instead, the court concluded that the only

We submit that the court of appeals erred in

22

23

redrafting the reasonable line drawn by Congress in

24

defining the term, "cable system," under the Cable Act of

25

1984.

The crux of the issue in this case is the proper
classification of satellite master antenna television, or
SMATV.

Unlike traditional cable systems, which pick up

distant signals at a remote antenna and transmit them to
the community through wires running under or over the city
streets, an SMATV facility typically sets up a rooftop
antenna and then transmits programming by wire to units in
a building or group of buildings.
In enacting the Cable Act of 1984, Congress had
to decide whether and when an SMATV system should be
treated like a traditional cable facility and made subject
to franchise requirements.
Contrary to the court of appeals' decision, the
line drawn by congress was a reasonable one:

an SMATV

system is exempt from any franchise requirement if the
system serves only multiple-unit dwellings under common
ownership, control, or management, and uses no public
rights of way.
QUESTION:

Are they generally free from FCC

regulations, as well?
MR. MANNING:

Well, the crux of this case is

what a cable system is, and a cable system determines -one's status as a cable system determines whether one is
subject to franchise requirements, but there are also
other Federal requirements that apply to cable systems as

QUESTION:

3

MR. MANNING:

4

QUESTION:

There are other -There are --

Requirements that these cable

5

operators, that these small cable operators are subject

6

to.

7

^

well, such as --

MR. MANNING:

That's right.

There are, for

8

example, technical requirements dealing with signal

9

interference, with the quality of the signal, and there

10

are other requirements pertaining to rate regulation and

11

so forth that apply to cable systems, but the only thing

12

that's at issue here is whether it's constitutional to

13

impose a franchise requirement on an SMATV facility that

14

serves only commonly-owned buildings.

15

In enacting the so-called private cable

16

exemption with its common-ownership requirement, Congress

17

made the judgment that it did not want to impose franchise

18

requirements on a building owner or condominium

19

association that decides to put a satellite antenna on the

20

building and provide cable television to its residents,

21

perhaps as an amenity.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Mann, when you are talking about

23

a franchise requirement, are you talking about a

24

requirement imposed by Congress, or a requirement that --

25

franchise that allows local governments to impose?

MR. MANNING:

Under 47 U.S.C. section 541,

Congress has provided that with the exception of
facilities that are grandfathered under subsection (b) of
that section, a cable operator -- that is, a person who
operates a cable system -- must obtain a franchise before
beginning to provide cable service.
QUESTION:

And a franchise from the Federal

Government.
MR. MANNING:

Franchise -- a franchising

authority -- it's not clear what they mean by franchise.
The act describes a franchise authority as a Federal,
State, or local authority that has power to issue a
license, but in practice what it means is a State or local
franchise, not a Federal franchise, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

So although the act may not be clear,

that is in practice what happens.

If you're subject to

this requirement you must get a franchise from a State or
local government.
MR. MANNING:

That's correct.

That's correct,

it's a State or local -- in practice a State or local
franchise requirement, and what Congress decided was that
if a building owner or a condo association decides to put
a satellite dish on the roof of the building and provide
cable service to its tenants, then that would not be
subject to a local franchise requirement.

1

Similarly, if the same building owner or condo

2

association ran a couple of buildings, or ran a building

3

complex and put a satellite antenna on the roof to provide

4

cable television to all the residents in the complex, that

5

also would not be subject to a local franchise

6

requirement.

7

But where a satellite antenna is set up to serve

8

multiple, separately-owned buildings, or if its wires run

9

over or under the city streets, Congress made the

10

determination that the facility looks more like a

11

traditional cable system and should be subject to

12

franchise requirements accordingly.

13
14

QUESTION:

Mr. Manning, is that the right-of-

way criterion, whether it goes over city streets?

15

MR. MANNING:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

That's correct, Your Honor.

So in New York City, you could wire

up an entire city block without using city rights-of-way.
MR. MANNING:

That's correct, and it could be - -

19

as your question suggests - -

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. MANNING:

Which is a lot of people.
It could be quite a number of

22

people, and the judgment that Congress made, that the

23

common-ownership requirement in addition to the right-of-

24

way requirement was a rational basis for distinguishing

25

between franchised and unfranchised facilities, was a

1

reasonable line.

2

The essence of the rational-basis test is that

3

debatable policy judgments are left to Congress, not the

4

Federal courts, and as this Court explained most recently

5

in Sullivan v. Stroop, a classification in a piece of

6

socioeconomic legislation must be sustained if any state

7

of facts may reasonably be conceived to justify it.

8

that standard, the line drawn by Congress in this case

9

easily passes constitutional muster.

10

Under

If a satellite antenna serves only a commonly

11

owned building or set of buildings, a plausible legislator

12

could think that it is more likely that the service is

13

being provided as part of the package of services that

14

management provides to its residents, that it's an

15

incident of residency.

16

Equivalently, a reasonable legislator could

17

conclude that the service provided by such a satellite

18

antenna would be less likely to be run in the nature of an

19

independent business venture, but even if you take a

20

building complex --

21

QUESTION:

What would be the virtue of that

22

conclusion, that it would be less likely to be run as an

23

independent business venture?

24
25

MR. MANNING:

Well, you would think that if you

were an owner of a building and you were putting up a

1

satellite dish and providing the service to your tenants,

2

that your primary interest would be in keeping your

3

tenants happy, because you are making a lot more money

4

from their rent, or from their condo fee, than you are

5

from providing them with cable service.

6

So in that situation, you could conclude that

7

there would be less need to interpose a franchising

8

authority to provide consumer protection, when the

9

building itself is really the provider of the service.

10

But even if you have a situation where the

11

building is making a contract with an outside SMATV

12

company to set up a satellite antenna on the building,

13

run the wires, own the wires, service the building,

14

arrange for the programming, and bill the tenants

15

separately, that company is still accountable to one set

16

of owners for the service that it provides from that dish.

17

to

Every subscriber who gets service off of that

18

satellite antenna can voice his or her complaints or

19

desires to a single set of owners, and the ownership has a

20

strong incentive to keep the subscribers happy, since

21

there is a substantial interest in keeping the rental, fees

22

and the condo fees flowing.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Manning,

24

almost as a matter of definition,

25

you're just describing,

is it correct,

I guess

that on the scenario

every unit of buildings is going

2

to have to have its own complete system?
I mean, there's going to have to be an antenna,

■r-jT

3

and so on, so the -- what I'm getting at is the investment

4

is going to be much greater in the cases subject to the

5

exception and the cancellation of the business would

6

consequently be far more disastrous.

7

MR. MANNING:

8

I mean, it wouldn't necessarily be a single

9

business, but it would be a single --a single building --

10

I'm sorry, a single building, but it would be a building

11

or building complex.

12

^

That's correct, Justice Souter.

And what you would do is, you would -- it would

13

involve the construction of a satellite head end, and it

14

may or may not involve wiring the buildings, because a lot

15

of these buildings have the old mater antenna television

16

system wiring already in place, so you might or might not

17

be able to use that.

18

So there is a substantial investment in building

19

the satellite head end facility, and if you were serving a

20

single set of buildings, and the ownership cancels that

21

contract, then you've lost out a lot.

QUESTION:

of leverage over your service.
And what's more, if a satellite antenna is not

3

limited to serving commonly owned buildings, as Justice

4

Scalia pointed out, it may well be expected, or a

5

reasonable legislature could at least think that you would

6

tend to have more subscribers served by that satellite

7

antenna, because you could wire an entire city block in

8

New York by running a wire from building to building.

And the owner would have real

monopoly power over that -- at least over all the people

2

And what's more, if you assume, as a reasonable

3

legislator could, that the size of the market served by

4

that facility, served by that head end satellite antenna

5

equipment, is larger if the common-ownership requirement

6

is not met, then the costs of franchising could be spread

7

among a greater number of consumers, and so Congress could

8

have reasoned that the cost-benefit ratio of imposing a

9

franchise requirement on a facility that serves separately

owned buildings would be more favorable.
QUESTION:

There's a lot of reasons you can

think of, aren't there?

really appears, as far as we know, in any of the debates.

14

MR. MANNING:

I mean -- but none of these

Well, Your Honor, this Court has

15

made perfectly clear in a number of cases, most recently

16

Nordlinger v. Hahn, but perhaps most clearly in the case

17

of Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, that the rationale

18

for a piece of legislation does not have to appear in the

19

legislative history or even in purposes articulated on the

20

face of the statute.

21

That issue was raised very clearly in the Fritz

22

case, where the dissent said that the evidence in that

23

case involved a question of line-drawing between those who

24

would be eligible for dual benefits under the social

25

security system and the railroad retirement system and
12

those who would not be eligible for that double-dipping,
and Congress drew a line based on whether one was serving
in the -- to summarize very sketchily, whether one was
serving in the railroad industry or had a current
connection in 1974.
The dissent said that that line disserved the
purposes of the statute as expressed in the legislative
history because it didn't provide all of the people who
had vested railroad retirement benefits with their
ultimate benefits, and this Court said that the purposes
of a statute for purposes of the rational-basis test did
not have to be reflected in the legislative history, and
that it was "constitutionally irrelevant whether the
rational basis was articulated by the legislature at all."
The Court also stated that the best evidence of
the legislative purpose is the text of the statute itself.
QUESTION:

Well, lots of times a bill starts out

intending to do one thing and amendments are tacked on, so
there may be several different purposes not necessarily
consistent with one another.
MR. MANNING:

That's exactly right, Mr. Chief

Justice.
It's very difficult -- as this Court has
explained many times, it's very difficult to know
precisely why a legislator is moved to vote for or against

1

a particular piece of legislation, and if the rationality

2

of a statute were measured in terms of the reasons

3

suggested by some legislators on the floor or by a

4

committee in a report, it would be very difficult indeed

5

to sustain the validity of much legislation, and it would

6

be quite an impingement on the independence of the

7

legislative branch.

8
9

In rejecting the rational justification, what we
call the consumer welfare rationale, the court of appeals

10

offered very little explanation in this case.

11

welfare rationale was suggested by Judge Mikva, Chief

12

Judge Mikva in his concurring opinion, and endorsed by the

13

FCC on remand.

14

Rather than addressing the substance of that

15

justification, the court of appeals merely dismissed it by

16

saying, we have no basis for assuming its validity, and by

17

calling it a "naked intuition" that the FCC has wholly

18

failed to flesh out.
QUESTION:

19

Mr. Manning, can I ask you a question

20

about the -- I'm not quite sure I entirely understand your

21

rationale.

Do they each negotiate separately, or

There are a number of these

That I'm not certain of, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

But if they're just part of a market,

why are they a different part of a larger market if 10

10

buildings are owned by one person on the one hand and

11

they're all owned by 10 separate people on the other?

12

MR. MANNING:

Well, I think the thing that makes

13

them a market is that what you're talking about when

14

you're talking about a facility, which is the unit that

15

you use to measure whether something's a cable system,

16

you're talking about the hardware, the satellite antenna

17

system, and as Justice Scalia pointed out, if you have a

18

building, you have a satellite antenna that's placed on a

19

building, then the people who own that building and --

QUESTION:

Well, if it's just one building, I

21

guess it doesn't matter, because if it's one building it

would be owned by one person or one association, but'isn't

no people that represent owners in dealing with the
franchise companies in this - MR. MANNING:

Again, the record is not clear,

and the crux of the rational-basis test is that Congress
is not disabled from legislating unless it can - - it is
not disabled from legislating at the risk of not being
able to prove that its policy judgments are empirically
justifiable or even correct.

That is the very clear

import - QUESTION:

Or have any scholarly support

whatsoever for them.
MR. MANNING:

Well, I mean, if you just take a

case like Railway Express Agency v. New York, in that case
New York City passed an ordinance, and the ordinance
provided that there was to be a ban on advertising on
trucks, but the ordinance also exempted selfadvertisements on the same trucks.
The court said - - the court upheld that
classification on the ground that a legislator may well
assume that those who advertise their own wares present
less of a traffic safety concern given the nature and
extent of the advertisements on their trucks.
There was no record support for that.

didn't cite any scholarly treatises, they didn't cite any

What the court did was, it indulged in the

3

democratic process by accepting plausible although

4

unverified assumptions about the way the world works.

5

QUESTION:

Is it your position that it's

6

plausible in the situation put by Justice Stevens to say

7

that in the case where there's single ownership there is

8

more leverage and therefore the market is different?

9
10
11

MR. MANNING:

We think it's very plausible to

think that.
We think that a reasonable legislator certainly

12

could assume that when you have a satellite dish that's

13

being put on a building that a) it's more likely that the

14

satellite service is being offered as an amenity to the

15

tenants, that it may not even be a separate market where

16

the SMATV company comes in, puts on the satellite, bills

17

the tenants and runs it separately.

18

But secondly, we think it's much more likely

19

that when you have the negotiation focused between one set

20

of owners for use of this very expensive piece of hardware

21

and a satellite company, even if it runs a hundred of

22

these satellite dishes around town, that the people who

23

live within that building are more likely to have leverage

24

over the product consumed than if you have the same

25

company putting a dish on and running it to 10 buildings.

1

Not only is the accountability more focused, but

2

if a satellite dish can only serve multiple-unit

3

dwellings, it is more likely that you are going to have

4

fewer subscribers, and that means that each subscriber is

5

going to have more leverage over the product produced, and

6

that the cost of franchising will be more significant

for -- per subscriber for subscribers who live in

buildings under common ownership.

QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Manning, if you prevail on

10

this argument, and in this case it's your position that we

11

should remand to the court of appeals for the

12

determination of whether or not some other more rigorous

13

standard applies?

14

MR. MANNING:

That's correct, Your Honor.

15

The court of appeals raised the question whether

16

a fundamental rights equal protection analysis should be

17

applied, but the court did not reach that question, and we

18

believe that the Court should leave it for the court of

19

appeals in first -- in the first --

QUESTION:

Does the FCC have a position as to

21

what standard applies if there is content significance to

by the court of appeals and we think it would be
preferable to leave it for consideration by the court of
appeals on remand.
QUESTION:

Well, two answers -- number 1, it

would be preferable, and number 2, you don't have a
position.
MR. MANNING:

We don't have a position, no.

In -- we believe that the court of appeals'
error in this case stemmed largely from the fact that it
perceived that the line drawn by Congress was different
than the line traditionally applied by the administrative
agency in deciding whether the franchise requirement
should be applied -- namely, the crossing of public
rights - of-way.
The FCC's traditional basis for imposing
franchise requirements on cable facilities, however, is
irrelevant to the constitutional question before this
Court.

Congress has no constitutional duty to adhere to

agency precedent or even to give a reasoned explanation
for departing from it.
In any case, it is wrong to say that the only
dividing line for franchise requirements had been the use
of public rights-of-way.

Under FCC regulations in the

1970's, a facility that did not satisfy the common21

In addition, the FCC's 1983 Earth Satellite

group of people could get together and in some cases

MS. COSTLOW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Of all interstate media of communications not

8

using the public streets and rights-of-way to deliver

9

their signal, only a single media -- that is, an SMATV

10

facility serving separately owned and managed multiple

11

dwelling units by wire has to obtain a franchise from a

12

municipality in order to enter the market and is subjected

13

to treatment as a cable system.

14

No franchise is required of an SMATV facility

15

serving a single multiple-unit dwelling.

16

required for that same SMATV operator to install a series

17

of separate satellite dishes in order to serve the exact

18

same apartment dwellings throughout the municipality.

19

franchise is required if an SMATV operator wishes to

20

interconnect separately owned or managed buildings by

means of an 18-gigahertz microwave link.

MS. COSTLOW:

The burdens that would be imposed

upon an SMATV facility that would have to obtain a

Those burdens would include, for example, having

include, on the local level, typically a requirement to

system because, as a result of the '92 act, any subscriber

2

can bring a complaint to the Federal Communications

3

Commission that the rates of the particular operator are

4

unreasonable, and that kind of price and rate regulation

5

is not imposed upon SMATV facilities serving a single

6

building, serving commonly owned or managed buildings,

7

serving those same buildings by means of microwave or an

8

infrared link, leasing telephone company lines, for

9

example, in order to interconnect those buildings, because

10

you don't have to obtain a franchise to do that.
In other words, the only time a franchise is

11
12

required to interconnect separately owned and managed

13

buildings is when those separately owned and managed

14

buildings are interconnected by a simple piece of wire, so

15

the exact distinction here is that you cannot cross a

16

public -- a private property boundary line in order to

17

serve separately owned or managed buildings by means of a

18

wire, but you can cross that same private property

19

boundary line to interconnect those same separately owned

20

and managed multiple-unit dwellings by means of a wireless

facility.

What the rationale was is that was based on a

the Earth Satellite decision, directly prior to the

7

passage of the 1984 Cable Act.

8

9

And that decision exempted these types of
facilities because they did not use a public street or

10

right-of-way, they were indistinguishable from wireless,

11

they were there to promote the open entry and the

12

unfettered development of interstate satellite signals,

13

and the Federal Communications Commission made a specific

14

finding that local franchising jurisdiction and control

acted as a barrier and chilled entry and therefore

just -- they wanted to advance and promote some

because if you assume that Congress meant to impose, on

which were to grant a single franchise for an entire

there are about nine or ten of those in various States
throughout the country.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
