ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH L. CUNNIFF

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12
13

MR. CUNNIFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

The question presented is whether criminal

15

defendants are entitled to separate trials when their

16

defenses are mutually antagonistic.

17

This case involved four defendants charged with

18

narcotics violations.

19

antagonistic defenses that he or she said were going to be

20

presented at trial.

21

and the court of appeals affirmed --

22
23

QUESTION:

The trial judge denied the motion,

Did -- there were four defendants,

and did each one of them make a motion?

24
25

Each moved for severance based upon

MR. CUNNIFF:

Yes, Your Honor, each made a

motion.

QUESTION:

13

MR. CUNNIFF:

Is she properly before the Court now?
I would suggest under fundamental

fairness she should be because if this Court finds that

15

the antagonistic defenses are still a proper basis for

severance, it had been raised previously, and she should

still be considered in that position.

In this case, it is the Government's -- it the

Government that is asking for a radical departure from the

accepted rule of severance.

MR. CUNNIFF:

QUESTION:

5

MR. CUNNIFF:

Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you.
The opinion of the court of

6

appeals improperly relies upon civil law for its rationale

7

using the analogy of interpleader and using the analogy of

8

joint tort cases.

9

the fundamental differences between a civil trial and a

proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.
In failing to distinguish between the civil case

5

and the criminal case, there is a serious risk that a

6

joint trial would confuse the jury and prevent the jury

7

from making a reliable judgment about the guilt or

8

innocence of one or more of the defendants.

9

When co-defendants attack each other and attack

20

each other's defenses before the jury, they blur together

21

as one, and as a result, both defendants are likely to be

22

convicted because neither defense is believed.

23

antagonism, each lawyer becomes the government's champion

QUESTION:

That's one scenario.

I suppose

5

another one is that if you try them separately and they

6

are both lying, each one will be acquitted, the other one

7

being absent and declining to testify because he might

8

tend to incriminate himself.

9

MR. CUNNIFF:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. CUNNIFF:

That's true, Your Honor.

It looks like a hard choice.
But again, in a criminal case it's

12

not up to the defendant to have to prove his innocence,

13

and this court decision actually results in a shifting of

14

the burden of proof from the Government to the defendant

15

because when the defendant gets up, he then not only has

16

the burden of proving that he himself is telling the

17

truth, he also must convince the jury that the co-

18

defendant is lying.

19

QUESTION:

Well, he'd have to do that if the co­

20

defendant weren't a co-defendant and chose to testify.

21

Why is that -- you know, you always have to respond to

22

people who are making arguments against you.

23

MR. CUNNIFF:

You would, Your Honor.

If his co­

24

defendant who has pled guilty or been found guilty who is

25

testifying, in that situation the co-defendant says I'm

guilty and my accomplice was the defendant on trial.

2

different than in a situation where a defendant is on

3

trial saying I am innocent, but it's the co-defendant who

4

is really guilty, and for my defense to be believed, the

5

co-defendant must be found guilty.
QUESTION:

Posner, if I can refer Your Honors to the opinion.

15

of a group of defendants is guilty, the entire group

And the

Government has no other evidence other than the fact one

of the defendants in the jail cell is murdered, but there

3

were only three other people there.

4

Judge Posner, if all three were tried together, the jury

5

would then be able to find which of the three -- by the

6

time that each made their presentation, if in fact one was

7

made, the jury would be able to find which of the three

committed the murder.

QUESTION:

11

Under this theory of

Well, what if they all refused to

The Government would have no proof.

MR. CUNNIFF:

And in fact, that's the point I

12

would try and make, Your Honor, because the Government

13

would have to prove a particular defendant guilty with

14

specific elements --

15

QUESTION:

It still --

16

MR. CUNNIFF:

17

QUESTION:

-- proving specific elements.

It still does to have its case go to

18

the jury.

19

Government has to have evidence that tends to prove each

20

of the elements of the crime against each defendant whose

about the severance rules changes that, does it?

23

As I understand the criminal law, the

defendant is going to be prejudiced, and the jury is going

2

to be unable to focus its attention on the individual

3

defendant to determine whether or not the prosecution has

4

met its burden of proving each and every element beyond a

5

reasonable doubt.

X

6

QUESTION:

That's where the concern comes in.
Well, we needn't quibble, but in your

7

hypothetical, I doubt that the Government has sufficient

8

probable cause to enable it to indict all three people in

9

the jail cell.

10

MR. CUNNIFF:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

And, in fact --

That would be questionable enough in

a civil suit.
MR. CUNNIFF:

But again, in Judge Posner's

14

opinion, he talks about specifically the analogy to

15

interpleader and to joint tort cases, and when you're

16

bringing those types of analogy into a criminal case,

17

you're then talking about relative degrees of

18

responsibility or relative degrees of fault which I'd

19

respectfully suggest is inappropriate in a criminal case.

20

QUESTION:

But here there was no doubt in the

21

world that this big suitcase of cocaine was brought to the

22

apartment by one of these people.

23

MR. CUNNIFF:

24
25

That's -- in fact, there's no

doubt it was brought by both people.
QUESTION:

Yes.

1

MR. CUNNIFF:

The issue is whether or not which,

2

if either, knew what the contents was of this very large

3

package that was brought up to the apartment.

4

QUESTION:

And there would be a certain irony if

5

-- under the facts that we know about this case, if all

6

four of these people were acquitted.

7

MR. CUNNIFF:

There would be an irony, Your

8

Honor, but I would suggest to Your Honor that that

9

probably would not occur if, in fact, the Government was

10

able to prove each of the defendants guilty and to show

11

the knowledge which would be inferred by virtue of the

12

fact of the possession without explaining what was

13

contained in the suitcase or the package that was being

14

carried by each individual.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose the trial court can

16

give an appropriate instruction regarding the burden of

17

proof on the part of the Government.

18

MR. CUNNIFF:

19

QUESTION:

I believe that the --

And we normally assume that jurors

20

will follow such instructions.

21

that you have, do you think?

22

MR. CUNNIFF:

Does that cure the concern

It does not, Your Honor, and it

23

does not because it's the position of the petitioner that,

24

as a result of the antagonistic defense, when each

25

defendant is going against the other defendant rather than

1

the Government going against the defendant, what you have

2

is a blurring and there's confusion.

3

there's a substantial likelihood that a conviction is

4

going to result not because of the evidence --

5

QUESTIONy.

And the concern is

Excuse me, but if we assume that a

6

proper instruction is given, why do we have to assume

7

there is confusion?

MR. CUNNIFF:

8
9

I don't understand.
The difficulty is the jury focuses

in on each of the defendant's defenses, and because each

10

is, in effect, saying the other person did it and I'm

11

innocent, the concern of the other cases in all the other

12

circuits that have considered this question is that the

13

jury will be unable to differentiate between the defendant

14

or the defendants.

15

this opinion, every other circuit recognized that

16

antagonistic defenses should be a grounds for severance.
QUESTION:

17

And that's the reason why up until

I just don't understand that fully.

18

It seems to me that the probability of a correct result,

19

of a nonerroneous determination, is much higher where all

20

of the witnesses can testify before the same trier of

21

fact.

It seems to me a very elemental proposition.

22

MR. CUNNIFF:

The difficulty is in a criminal

23

case, the question isn't whether or not a particular act

24

was done.

25

whether or not the particular defendant has been charged

The question, I respectfully suggest, is

with the particular - - who has been charged with a

3

elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, not

4

whether or not the act actually occurred, not whether or

5

not the package was actually carried up by either of the

6

two defendants, but whether or not the Government proved

7

the elements, including knowledge of what was in the

8

container, beyond a reasonable doubt.

9

Your Honor, that would be the distinction.

10

QUESTION:

I would suggest,

The Government in their brief takes

11

the position that a single jury in a joint trial would

12

have to virtually conclude that some of the petitioners

13

are guilty.

14

any, of the petitioner's stories seemed plausible and

15

convict those whose did not.

16

the Government referred to in their brief.

17

The jury's task would be to decide which, if

That's the standard which

The difficulty with this standard is that's not

19

which of the stories seem plausible, but it's up to the

20

jury to determine whether or not the Government had met

21

their burden of proof with respect to each element of the

22

crime which he's charged.

23

QUESTION:

It's not up to a jury to determine

I suppose if the Government wanted to

make sure they had that evidence that you object to from

J»K

3

MR. CUNNIFF:

That's correct, Your Honor.

There

4

would be the same testimony, but that would be coming in

5

an immunized situation as opposed to a co-defendant on

In other words, it would be less

MR. CUNNIFF:

That's correct, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

QUESTION:

You know, in a sense -- I'm just

12

trying to think this thing through.

The two pairs -- one

13

testified and the other didn't testify at all, as I

14

remember it.

15

knew the contents of the suitcase, and Garcia did not take

16

the stand.

Like Soto testified that Garcia had the --

17

MR. CUNNIFF:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

It would seem to me that in the joint

19

trial one would be more apt to believe Soto simply because

20

of the fact that the other defendant didn't get up on the

21

stand and say anything.

22

he's telling the truth because nobody has denied this,

23

whereas if he was there all by himself, he might be less

24

apt to do it.

if they had been tried separately.

'V

2

MR. CUNNIFF:

Because I think what occurs, Your

3

Honor, is that when Garcia's attorney in closing argument

4

took the contrary position and said really it was Soto who

5

possessed, it was Soto's home, it was Soto's automobile,

6

what in effect occurred was they had two co-defendants, in

7

effect, trying each other and trying to convict each other

8

rather than permitting the Government to convict -- try to

9

convict the defendant as a trial should actually proceed.

10

And what you have here - - and you can even take

11

Your Honor's example further.

12

testifies that really it's Garcia who did all of these

13

things, and Garcia does not testify, it's solely Garcia's

14

attorney in his closing argument which -- who says it

15

really was Soto.

16

closing arguments are merely - -

when those things will occur, the practical effect is the

facts get blurred, and the jury begins to confuse what

Why is that prejudice,

to get testimony under oath even though it hurts your

client?

12

MR. CUNNIFF:

It's not just that it hurts the

13

client, but in terms of the defense which is presented for

14

the defendant's testimony to be believed, it requires that

15

the jury convict the co-defendant, which would be --

that's the basic argument in terms of what the

antagonistic defense is.

when the co-defendant is arguing that my -- when the co­

defendant is arguing that he knew nothing about the

possession of the large box which contained the cocaine,

point, it's shifting the burden.

the Government withstands a motion to dismiss.

10

MR. CUNNIFF:

11

QUESTION:

12

Correct, Your Honor.

I mean, the Government has got to

make its case and sustain a motion.

13

MR. CUNNIFF:

And at that point, there is a

14

prima facie case, and this only occurs after the motions

15

for directed verdict of acquittal have been denied.

16

at that point, there would be sufficient evidence to go to

17

a jury in terms of a prima facie case, but perhaps not

18

sufficient to convict using the standard which the

19

Government must use.

20

QUESTION:

decide to take the stand because they think if they don't,

the specific circuits are -- the Fourth, the Tenth, and

2

Eleventh, and the D.C. Circuit take the position that

3

severance is required when the co-defendants present

4

irreconcilable or mutually exclusive defenses, and the

5

jury will unjustifiably infer that the conflicting

6

defenses are in and of themselves established that both

7

defendants are guilty.

8

9

The Second, the Fifth, and the Seventh, up until
this case, held that standard that severance is required

10

if the defenses are inconsistent to the degree that

11

accepting one co-defendant's defense would preclude a jury

12

from accepting the other's defense.

13

So, in each case in which this has occurred and

14

which the jury found that there are antagonistic defenses,

15

uniformly all of the courts have required severance.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MANNING:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

We have three points here.

First, the motion

12

for severance is typically made at the beginning of trial

13

and then renewed again throughout.

14

in this case, and that is a fairly standard practice.

15

This Court has made clear that the obligation under rule

16

14 to consider the question of severance is a continuing

17

obligation on the trial court throughout trial.

That was what occurred

The difficulty, however, is that when defendants

18
19

file a motion for severance at the outset, it is very

20

difficult to tell how the trial is to proceed, and the

21

better practice for the district court is to wait the

22

development of the trial and see if there is, in fact,

23

prejudice from any source before it renders the decision

24

to severe.

Now, there could be cases -- I don't know if
there are or not -- in which there is, in fact, an
innocent person out with his uncle or something like that
who, if tried separately, would tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, but would be unwilling to get on
the stand in a courtroom with his accomplice and accuse
somebody who's a member of his family or somebody he's
very close to.

So, it's conceivable that the antagonistic

defense would actually prevent somebody from testifying
who would otherwise testify.
MR. MANNING:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

You don't think that's possible.

MR. MANNING:

We think -- it's certainly

possible, but we think it highly unlikely.

I mean, in the

run of the mill case, what you're dealing with is two
people who are closely connected with criminal wrongdoing
and who -- one of whom is likely guilty.

decision of the nephew not to take the stand because he's

he's making.

grant, would you not?

MR. MANNING:

QUESTION:

We would.

Well, at some point you have to say

that a defendant who decides not to testify because he

doesn't want to hurt an uncle's feelings,

MR. MANNING:

Well,

that's his

that's exactly right,

Chief

Justice Rehnguist.
QUESTION:

And if the definition of an

11

antagonistic defense is that if you believe one of them,

12

you necessarily convict the other or you disbelieve him,

13

here everybody was convicted.

14

MR. MANNING:

Well,

that's correct, and that --

QUESTION:

And they didn't believe -- they

believed both of them.

MR. MANNING:

(Laughter.)

20

MR. MANNING:

Not only that --

Not only that, Your Honor, but

21

everybody - - it is more accurate to say that everybody was

22

convicted of conspiracy, but in fact, Gloria Zafiro was

23

acquitted on the three substantive counts of possession,

24

which indicates that the jury was perfectly capable of

25

sorting through the evidence and applying it separately to

each.
QUESTION:

But the people who -- all of the

people who moved for severance were convicted.
MR. MANNING:

All of them were convicted of at

least one offense, but that -- they were all convicted of
conspiracy.

Gloria Zafiro moved for severance later in

the trial after the presentation of the evidence.
didn't move at the outset.

She moved later.

She

And she was

convicted of conspiracy, but she was acquitted of the
substantive defenses.
QUESTION:

But the other four.

MR. MANNING:
everything.

The other three were convicted of

That's correct.

QUESTION:

And you take the position that had

the trial judge here granted a severance, it would have
been an abuse of discretion?
MR. MANNING:

That's right, Justice O'Connor.

We think that it would have been an abuse of discretion,
but as a practical matter, we would point out that since
we don't have a right to appeal that point under 18 U.S.C.
3731, then the practical import of saying that it's an
abuse of discretion is somewhat limited although that is a
reason I would point out for the Court, if it rules in our
favor, to be very clear in stating that antagonism alone
is not prejudice within the meaning of the rules so that

the district courts have clear guidance in knowing when
they can sever on the basis of antagonistic defenses.
If there are no further questions.
MR. MANNING:

Thank you, Mr. Manning.

Mr. Cunniff, you have 6 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH L. CUNNIFF
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CUNNIFF:

As counsel for the Government just

told you, the 11 of the 12 circuits that have considered
this question have all agreed that if an antagonistic
defense is presented, there should be grounds for
severance.
QUESTION:

How -- which was the first decision

in this line?
MR. CUNNIFF:
QUESTION:

I don't recall --

Who started this snowball?

MR. CUNNIFF:

It started back in the '30's, Your

Honor, I believe.
QUESTION:

Back in the '30's?

MR. CUNNIFF:

Yes, Your Honor.

I don't have the

specific cases in front of me.
QUESTION:

That's all right.

MR. CUNNIFF:

Thank you.

But in each of the cases -- and

Mr. Justice Stevens, I suggest the reason there probably
is no scholarly work in this area is because the reason is
