ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANKIE SUE DEL PAPA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MS. DEL PAPA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our Nation's prisons are dangerous places.

We

11

take our most troubled and troublesome citizens, we put

12

them behind walls for our protection and their

13

rehabilitation.

14

designed for security, ours and theirs, then we ask those

15

who manage them to somehow make it work.

We do so in structures and under rules

16

It is a difficult, complex job; one in which the

17

most routine daily decisions can have serious, even lethal

18

consequences.

19

that 35 States, the United States District of Columbia,

20

Puerto Rico, and three territories, ask you to reverse a

21

Ninth Circuit opinion that is not only in direct conflict

22

with opinions of other circuit courts, but severely

23

impacts the serious decisions confronting the men and

24

women who run our Nation's over 1,300 prisons.

25

It is in recognition of those consequences

The respondent in this case was convicted of

murder and is serving his sentence in the Nevada prison

2

system.

3

alleging he had shared a cell with a series of inmates who

4

were heavy smokers and that prison officials had done

5

nothing to separate smoking and nonsmoking inmates.

6

also alleged certain medical symptoms as a result of

7

exposure to secondary cigarette smoke, and that the

8

exposure constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

In 1 87 he filed a civil rights complaint

He

He sought an injunction prohibiting prison
10

administrators from housing him with inmates who smoke and

11

asked for compensatory and punitive damages.

12

complaint launched the case that is before the Court

13

today.

14

That

The question is whether, as the Ninth Circuit

15

has held, the respondent has stated a valid Eighth

16

Amendment claim.

17

Even --

QUESTION:

General Del Papa, has Nevada changed

18

its regulations since the institution of the lawsuit,

1

concerning -- insofar as they would affect placement of

20

prisoners for smoking or nonsmoking purposes?

21

MS. DEL PAPA:

No, Justice O'Connor.

The --

22

the -- what was in existence at the time of this initial

23

complaint was an informal policy of accommodation in terms

24

of whenever practical.

25

QUESTION:

And now that's embodied in written

policies

MS. DEL PAPA:

3

QUESTION:

4

That's correct.

-- That are consistent with the

former informal policies.

5

MS. DEL PAPA:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And this particular petitioner, I

7

mean plaintiff in the suit below, has been moved since the

8

institution of the lawsuit.

9
10
11

MS. DEL PAPA:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And is he presently being housed in a

single cell?

12

MS. DEL PAPA:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

Do you think there's some reason to

14

think that he may be moved again during his incarceration

15

and again subjected to secondary smoke?

16

MS. DEL PAPA:

The underlying facts are capable

17

of repetition, yes.

18

classifications are reviewed through administrative

19

regulations at least every 6 months.

But, again, there is

20

always the possibility of transfers.

Because he is in a

21

single cell now does not mean that he will always have a

22

single cell.

23

QUESTION:

Because at any time -- of course,

Let me ask you another question while

24

I have you interrupted.

1

has to show that the prison authority is deliberately

2

indifferent to any condition arising from secondary smoke.

3

MS. DEL PAPA:

4

QUESTION:

5

And was that issue ever addressed in

the courts below, deliberate indifference --

6

MS. DEL PAPA:

7

QUESTION:

8

Yes.

The --

-- In light of the policy of the

prisons?

9

MS. DEL PAPA:

Well, the informal policy, of

10

course, was in place at the time.

11

specifically found no serious medical need nor deliberate

12

indifference.
QUESTION:

13
14

And the magistrate

The magistrate found no deliberate

indifference.

MS. DEL PAPA:

20

QUESTION:

21

MS. DEL PAPA:

Yes.

And was that, then, reviewed?
Yes.

That finding?
Yes.

And what was the finding on review?
The finding on review -- the

22

court of appeals attempted to distinguish between a

23

serious medical need of a present condition and a future

24

condition.

25

QUESTION:

The deliberate indifference finding,

was that ever addressed on review?

2

MS. DEL PAPA:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

Well --

That there was no deliberate

indifference.
MS. DEL PAPA:

The court of appeals on - - wanted

6

to remand this case because of the - - the way that - -

7

well, they first, of course, found that they disagreed

8

with --I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

I guess I'm trying to find out

10

whether the court ever addressed the -- the finding that

11

there was no deliberate indifference.

12

me that if there is no deliberate indifference, there is

13

no need to look at the objective question at all.

14

MS. DEL PAPA:

Because it seems to

Well -- and we would argue that,

15

yes, they did review the deliberate indifference because

16

they did find no abuse of discretion on -- on the part of

17

the magistrate.

18

that she had found no constitutional right to a smoke-free

1

environment, where they had found a different claim here.

20

And -- and it is our contention --

21

However, it's complicated by the fact

QUESTION:

Is there any need to address the

22

objective question if -- if it's clear that there was no

23

deliberate indifference?

24

MS. DEL PAPA:

QUESTION:

No.

Well, didn't the deliberate

indifference go to two different issues?

One, whether he

had a medical condition that had not been adequately taken
care of.

And secondly, whether they were deliberately

indifferent to the whole smoking policy.

Weren't they

separate in that magistrate -- before the magistrate, or
am I wrong on that?
MS. DEL PAPA:

I don't -- I don't believe so.

QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION:

Well, didn't the magistrate find that

there was really no problem unless the prisoner had some
symptoms, some active symptoms of -- that would require
medical treatment?

That just a latent threat, as yet

unrealized, just wouldn't state a cause of action.

And on

that basis they found no deliberate -- no -- no
indifference because there weren't any symptoms.
MS. DEL PAPA:

There were symptoms, Justice

White, that -QUESTION:

All right.

But, anyway, whatever the

symptoms were, they weren't -- he found that they were not
deliberately indifferent.
MS. DEL PAPA:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, the point is that the

deliberate indifference finding of the magistrate was
connected with the -- with the substantive finding that
there's no - - that there's no problem so long as you don't

MS. DEL PAPA:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

That you don't have a right to -- so

4

you can't really say that the rest of the case goes away

5

by reason of the deliberate indifference finding.
MS. DEL PAPA:

6

Well, we would argue that the --

7

the exposure to the environmental tobacco smoke in the

8

first instance does not meet with the objective component.

9

And, of course, I realize you can take these and there's

10

no set way in taking these.
QUESTION:

11

No, but -- but the problem is if --

12

if this case comes to us with the finding that, in fact,

13

the State was not indifference -- was not indifferent to

14

this -- to this prisoner's desire to have a nonsmoking

15

roommate and was not indifference to his - - was not

16

indifferent deliberately to his desire to -- to have clean

17

air, entirely clean, free of cigarette smoke, then, as

18

Justice O'Connor says, we don't have to reach the other

19

issue.

20

But I did not understand the magistrate to have

21

said oh, the State was very -- very concerned about this

22

prisoner's right to clean air.

23

said he has no right to clean air.

24

if he has symptoms, to be given some consideration, but

25

they did that.

I thought the magistrate
Now, he has a right,

that.

Now, is that a fair description of what --

2

MS. DEL PAPA:

Yes.

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. DEL PAPA:

5

First let us say that we share concern that

Okay.
That's a very fair description.

6

exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a potential

7

health hazard.

8

EPA's recent report giving ETS class-A status as an

9

environmental hazard.

We fully recognize and appreciate the

But we do not agree that exposure

10

to it rises to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation.

11

Giving it that status has considerable consequences.

QUESTION:

Even though it's five packs a day.

MS. DEL PAPA:

No.

prison system.

who must daily balance health and security concerns in the

management of these complex and inherently dangerous

institutions.

QUESTION:

Even as that process

the Ninth Circuit has mistakenly-

But is that really a fair

interpretation of the court of appeals?

As I understood

10

it,

they remanded and now there're two issues to be

11

decided in the district court proceedings.

12

objectively the harm is sufficient and secondly, the

13

deliberate indifference problem.

14

that -- that the plaintiff will win on remand?

15

MS. DEL PAPA:

Have they really decided

Well, what the Ninth Circuit has

16

done,

17

different standard than what this Court's standard is for

18

Eighth Amendment violations by - - they framed the question

19

below in terms of whether such - - such exposure posed an

20

unreasonable risk of harm, but that's not the -- the

21

standard that this Court applies to Eight Amendment

22

violations.

23

I would contend,

One, whether

the warden,

if he wanted to, could deliberately impose an

unreasonable risk of harm to a nonsmoker by putting him in

of harm?

MS. DEL PAPA:

I'm sorry, I don't understand the

question.
QUESTION:

Do you take the position that the

6

warden could deliberately house a person with a smoker

7

knowing that that person would - - would have a very

8

serious risk of harm from the smoking?

9

MS. DEL PAPA:

We take the position that, again,

10

because there is an accommodation policy and because

11

smoking is of a secondary concern -- smoking is considered

12

to be a personal preference.

13

that the warden would have to take into consideration

14

first before reaching and trying to accommodate the -- the

15

smoking preference.

16

QUESTION:

There are other concerns

Such things as -Does he have any duty at all, under

17

the Constitution, to accommodate a smoking concern that

serious harm - -

Well, would it violate the Federal

Constitution, though, do you think?

QUESTION:

No.

Well, do you agree that deliberate

11

indifference to an unreasonable risk of serious harm would

12

violate the Eighth Amendment?

MS. DEL PAPA:

The problem with what you have

stated, Justice Kennedy, is the unreasonable risk of harm

portion of that.

17

constitutional right and -- and then you had -- and

18

thereby completing the objective component of the Wilson

19

v. Seiter test, and then you showed deliberate

20

indifference, then, yes, you would have -- that's where

21

you would have the problem.

22

Because it's -- it's very difficult to

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I just want to make sure

23

we are agreed on the standard.

You do agree, then, that

MS. DEL PAPA:

QUESTION:

3
4

Well 1--

That's the correct legal standard for

us to apply.
MS. DEL PAPA:

No, Your Honor, that is not the

5

correct legal standard, because this Court's standard, in

6

terms of conditions of confinement cases such as Rhodes v.

7

Chapman, is instead inhumane conditions.

8

would first have to consider whether or not this is a -- a

9

serious deprivation of life's minimal necessities, and

10

then you would reach the question of what is cruel and

11

unusual punishment.

12

I think that you

And, of course, all of that ties back to the

13

question of what are society's standards.

14

the society that we live in, smoking is accepted.

15

us are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.

QUESTION:

In - - today in
All of

Well, we can --we can argue about

17

what is or is not a serious risk of -- of harm.

18

I'm -- I'm simply wondering about your standard that

19

you're applying.

20

MS. DEL PAPA:

But

Well, the standard that I believe

21

should apply is this Court's standard with reference to

22

Eighth Amendment cases, and not an unreasonable risk of

23

harm standard that the Ninth Circuit attempted to apply in

24

the original case.

prisoner in with him.

5

to that risk constitute an Eighth Amendment violation?

And suppose we assume that it's an

Now, would deliberate indifference

6

MS. DEL PAPA:

7

QUESTION:

No.

You can distinguish that from the

8

case that we have before us, I suppose, in that one could

9

certainly argue that Justice Kennedy's hypothesis poses a

10

punishment that is perhaps not only cruel but unusual,

11

whereas I gather one of your points is that this is not --

12

if it's a punishment, it's nonetheless not an unusual

13

punishment, because people in civil society outside of the

14

prison are exposed to pretty much the same thing all the

15

time.

16

MS. DEL PAPA:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, what does the -- does the

18

record show the number or percentage of prisoners in this

19

particular prisoner who smoked?
MS. DEL PAPA:

20

Yes.

It has been agreed that

21

anywhere between two-thirds and 90 percent of inmates

smoke.

unreasonable risk is not the appropriate way to - - to

state it.

3

stated in terms of unreasonable risk or an unreasonable

4

deprivation of life's necessities, what is or is not

reasonable is ultimately, is it not, a function to be

Is that

Yes.

Who should make that determination in

MS. DEL PAPA:

Should a district

I would think that, again -- and

13

what this Court has said is that the clearest and most

14

reliable objective factor with risk is, of course, our

15

legislative enactments.

16

those as the factors as to what society's standards are.

17

QUESTION:

I think you would look first to

Well, they're -- they're something to

18

look at, but my question is who should look at it?

19

Because, for example, we -- we may indeed look at

20

legislative enactments and I suppose -- I haven't done it,

21

but I -- I assume we will find legislation about smoke-

22

free zones in public buildings and so on.

23

But in each of those instances the legislature

24

is dealing with people who, by and large, have some

25

voluntary control as to whether or not they will or will

not be in the smoke-free zone.

2

not, in effect, going to answer our question; it's just

3

going to be part of the record on which the question

should be answered.

5

So that the legislation is

And -- and I go back to the question, who

6

should, in effect, compile that record and where should it

7

be compiled?

8

right here and now?

9

Are we in a position to make that judgment

MS. DEL PAPA:

I would say no, because I think

10

that the standard of decency relative to exposure of

11

environmental tobacco smoke in our country has not

12

evolved.

13

The debate is continuing.
QUESTION:

Don't you agree that deliberate

14

indifference to the obvious medical needs of the prisoner

MR. ROBERTS:

13

Nevada prison officials are now required expressly to

accommodate nonsmokers and smokers alike.

MR. HITCHCOCK:

10

if I may, Justice White.

I think -- and let me emphasize

this point because it goes to Justice Kennedy's question

12

as well as your own.

If the policy is in effect and if it

13

is being implemented,

if it's being followed,

14

the prisoner would have a difficult situation.
If the complaint is, yes,

15

then I think

there's this policy,

16

but they're ignoring it,

they're not celling me - - there's

17

three cells down there where they could give me a cellmate

18

and they're not doing it, or they're not having no-smoking

would still be an open issue.

this whole notion is -- is based upon the fact that,

The lawsuit in question challenges conditions at a prison

I mean, for example, the Chief Justice asked

to which he is no longer assigned, and where there's no

So I -- I think, as some of the questions by

conditions at the Ealey State Prison where he is presently

8

think, as cases like Lewis v. Continental Bank and the

am unable to do the sort of factual and legal research

that would be necessary in order to frame either a new

I'd like to -- to pick up another question

Justice O'Connor asked before about the finding of a

10

deliberate indifference.

11

the trial court viewed the issue, there are two questions.

12

One, deliberate indifference to existing conditions and

13

two, the question of whether there was a constitutional

14

violation of the broader sort that the court of appeals

15

recognized.

16

It is certainly correct that, as

The court of appeals decided quite explicitly,

17

and this is at pages -- see 38 and 39 of the Joint

18

Appendix, that there was no deliberate indifference as to

19

the present conditions in which Mr. McKinney was being

20

confined.

21

at trial as to the future conditions, the finding of

22

deliberate indifference does not extend to the second

claim.

amici agree with us, that the subjective element which

underlies deliberate indifference did not come into play

here.

What the magistrate - - the way the magistrate

viewed the case -- and this, again, is at pages 41 and 42

of the Joint Appendix.

Most of the exhibits dealt with

I would point out also that Mr. McKinney, prior

4

to trial, made a motion to have the appointment of an

5

expert toxicologist to talk about precisely these issues.

6

That motion, which was denied by the magistrate prior to

7

trial but which the court of appeals said should not have

8

been denied, asked for a - - an expert to testify on such

9

issues as, and I'm quoting -- well, what he said was

10

without the testimony of an environmental toxicologist,

11

plaintiff cannot prove the effect of smoker's side-stream

12

smoke upon a nonsmoker.

13

He said that he had been in touch with a

toxicologist at the local university but could not pay

him, and asked would you appoint someone.

16

appeals said the magistrate erred under Rule 706 of the

said that when the case is remanded for trial the

there wouldn't be a need for taking testimony from an

expert, would there?

4

I mean that would be the end of the case,
because you have to meet two prongs.

5

MR. HITCHCOCK:

Yes.

The case may well be

6

decided on summary judgment based on the subjective prong.

7

The question that is presented in this case however, the

8

only issue that the State brought up, is the question of

9

whether the objective prong of an Eighth Amendment

10

violation can be stated based upon the exposure to tobacco

11

smoke that may cause a serious injury down the road.
QUESTION:

12

Well I thought normally we tried to

13

avoid deciding tough constitutional issues if there was

14

some other factual nonconstitutional basis for deciding

15

it.

16

MR. HITCHCOCK:

That is correct, and that's why

17

we suggested in our brief that the policy in question

18

here, if it had been brought up at the petition stage, we

19

could have talked about it and suggested that the best

20

resolution would have been either to deny certiorari and

let the case go back, either in the judgment or affirm --

22

with the judgment of the court of appeals remaining

unaffected, or with instructions to consider this element

as well.

there had been an explicit policy in question.

There is a -- a series of scientific papers, scientific

3

MR. HITCHCOCK:

Well, if I could give a factual

4

answer, one of the striking things about the EPA's study,

5

although it's not gone into detail, is that the part of

the population most susceptible to serious injuries are,

in fact, children.

QUESTION:

Well, wasn't that up to Mr. McKinney,

to what - - what issues he went to trial on?
MR. HITCHCOCK:

It was up to trial, but -- but

7

the -- the second claim recognized by the court of appeals

8

turned upon his ability to produce some kind of evidence

9

as to the long-term exposure, and I believe he protected

10

his right by filing not one but two motions to have expert

11

testimony, which was denied, in which the magistrate --

12

which the court of appeals said he's entitled to.

13

I think the distinction, in response to your

14

question and other questions from the Court, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, is that --a distinction between a case such as

If a prisoner complained on the first day of

deliberate indifference to a current condition.

exposure after a month or several weeks or a year, that

might be a situation where there was an injury.

QUESTION:

Well, then a decision on the

And as the Court pointed out in Hutto,

MR. HITCHCOCK:

Well, as a matter of law to

guide the lower courts.
But let me talk also more specifically about

13

that, because I think analytically the question of whether

14

exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can, at some

9

level, rise to an objective Eighth Amendment violation
16
17

really has two subclass -- subparts to it.
The first is whether, at a general level or as a

18

general proposition, exposure to a hazard which does not

19

manifest itself immediately but is -- poses an

20

unreasonable risk of a serious harm at some future point

21

is covered by the Eighth Amendment.

22

That's the position that the State takes in this

23

case, although the solicitor general, at least, does not

24

go that far.

25

that argument would mean, and then I will suggest that

And let me give an example of what accepting

this Court has not gone that far in its opinions.

2

Under the State's formulation in this case, let

3

us suppose that prisoners in a prison system were given

4

shots using the same needle.

5

a flu shot or whatever.

6

the inmates sharing that needle were HIV positive and

7

let's suppose that that would have the effect of exposing

8

some unexposed prisoners to be getting the AIDS virus and

9

dying a rather slow and painful death somewhere down the

10
11

They had to share a needle,

And let's suppose that some of

road.
Under that scenario the State posits that that

12

is not cruel and unusual punishment to expose people to

13

that risk, that the Eighth Amendment only applies if death

14

or serious injury is -- is instantaneous or imminent, and

15

it does not cover those types of situations down the road.

16

I think that argument is foreclosed, at least

17

implicitly, by decisions of this Court such as Hutto v.

18

Finney and Rhodes v. Chapman, particularly Rhodes where

19

the Court cited with approval a number of lower court

20

decisions which also involved threats of -- of imminent

21

danger where it was not clear that somebody would be --

22

would be injured.

MR. HITCHCOCK:

I don't

Well, again, I think the

question is -- I think one can find an answer to that by

7

looking to the severity of the risk here, where you have

8

the risk at this level for a period of time, and I just

9

don't -- I don't think if, also, one looks at the way

10

society treats smoking, at least with respect to adults in

a number of situations, that that is the level of

exposure.

12

further, Justice O'Connor.

in the 1991 Journal of the American Medical Association, a

number of other municipalities with populations of over

Of course, we don't know whether

MR. HITCHCOCK:

Well, there is a consensus, I

Justice O'Connor's inquiry, the -- the JAMA article that

we cited indicates that by mid-1989, and I'm quoting now,

nearly all urban Americans were covered by a State or

18

And to finish up on

I'd like to come back to your question, Justice

19

Scalia, because I think there may be another distinction

20

to separate this case from the child abuse case.

21

problems that we are talking about here, I think, are more

22

serious than those that have identified with children.

24

serious, often fatal situation.

Administrator Reilly stated on Wednesday that the risk of

death from lung cancer is at about 1 in 1,000 for people

who have never smoked.

6

But if we found the same risk -- the

that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to serve

If you had a level,

a risk of 1 in 1,000, which is the risk of death by lung

cancer or heart disease, my answer would be yes.

18

put that in context, 1 in 1,000 doesn't sound like much,

said entitles OSHA to regulate risks on the grounds that
