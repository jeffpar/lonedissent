ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

involves enforcement of a Federal Government contract.

The same contract is rooted in a Federal statute, and

As a result, it arises under Federal

18

Treasury.

19

this case belonged in State court to be governed by

20

State law.

21

Nonetheless, the court of appeals held that

The court of appeals should be reversed.
In particular, this case concerns the

22

reimbursement of health benefits by a Federal employee

23

to his Federal Government health benefit plan, which is

24

known as the service benefit plan.

25

governed by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act,

contract.

3

In this case, Empire paid approximately

4

$157,000 in benefits for certain injuries suffered by

5

Joseph McVeigh, but the plan conditioned the payment of

6

those benefits on reimbursement in the event that a

recovery was made from a third party.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Those terms are

13

about it?

14

have this reimbursement term, and the other side said

15

that there was no requirement from the Government

16

agency that you include the reimbursement term.

17

I think you said it was required by OPM to

MR. SHELLEY:

Under the statute -- Justice

18

Ginsburg, under the statute, the Office of Personnel

19

Management is charged with selecting the benefits and

20

exclusions for this particular program and for this

21

particular plan.

22

And those terms are -- OPM has the final authority over

23

those terms and those terms are placed in a statement

24

of benefits which the -- which this statute also says

25

shall become part of the contract and are attached and

over the benefits and the exclusions --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the final authority

But that -- all that says

4

is that OPM looked at these terms and it thought they

5

were okay.

6

required these -- this as a condition for Empire to

7

serve as the insurer.

8
9

It's not -- it doesn't show that OPM

MR. SHELLEY:

Well, it's -- our obligations

are through the contract, and our only obligations here

10

are the ones in the contract.

11

that provision is in the contract.

12

that, we were -- we were mandated to enforce that

13

provision.

14

out, it had the final authority to take it out, and it

15

would only have been included if, as a matter of

16

authorization, OPM wanted it in there.

17

And that contract -And as a result of

If the Government wanted that provision

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's different from

18

putting it in.

19

what you allege, that -- that it's mandated by the

20

Government to simply the Government, although it had

21

authority to eliminate it, did not do so?

22

that's a different -- different assertion.

23

I mean, you want to change what you --

MR. SHELLEY:

24

difference.

25

the contract.

If -- you know,

The fact of the reality is that it's in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'll assume it's the latter

then.

3

MR. SHELLEY:

The reality is that the --

4

these reimbursement terms are in all the contracts

5

essentially of the FEHBA carriers, and as a result, I

6

think it can be assumed that it's the policy of the

7

Government that they should be in here.

8

of them is that they save the Government money.

9

does make good Government policy to have these

10

13

So it

provisions in -- in the contracts to begin with.

11
12

And the result

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But this is a fairly

indirect way of establishing a Federal cause of action.
I mean, it -- it's a preemption provision.

Why isn't

14

it reasonable to assume Congress thought there was no

15

need for a Federal cause of action?

16

contract action.

17

and they assumed they'd be handled by State court.

18

Because it's a

State courts handle those every day,

MR. SHELLEY:

I think the Court's decision in

19

Jackson Transit sets up the framework for that, and

20

that is, that Congress did assume there would be a

21

contract cause of action, but --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I noticed you

23

referred in your brief to the Jackson Transit line of

24

authority.

25

has been cited in the last 20 years by this Court?

Do you know how many times Jackson Transit

MR. SHELLEY:

It has not been applied again

2

since then, but we would say it's settled law as a

3

result.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think it's never been applied and it's not been

6

cited once in 20 years.

7

authority?

8
9

It's not been cited.

MR. SHELLEY:

So what's the line of

Well, it's four or five cases

that Jackson Transit was built on, for instance, the

10

Machinists case v. Central Airlines, which came out of

11

the 1960's.

12

principle is simple and it's a strong one, and that is

13

that Congress assumes that a -- when it calls for the

14

creation of a -- a contract in a statute, that it will

15

be enforceable just as with ordinary contracts.

16

In those cases, for instance, they -- the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Those cases came from the

17

days when we were also quite willing to imply Federal

18

causes of action in statutes that had nothing to do

19

with the Government, you know, 10b-5 and things of that

20

sort.

21

want us to go back to that bygone age.

I thought we had put all of that behind us.

22

MR. SHELLEY:

You

No, I don't think so, Justice

23

Scalia.

24

specifically differentiated between Congress assuming

25

there was a contract cause of action whenever it calls

The -- the Court in Jackson Transit

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

for the creation of a contract and separately implying

2

a cause of action.

3

that has to -- in doing that, the Court has to create a

4

cause of action in the first place, but Congress is

5

assumed to want contracts to be enforceable when it

6

calls for the creation of the contracts in a Federal

7

statute.

8
9

That's different because that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We're not talking

about the contract between you and the Federal

10

Government.

11

between you and an individual employee.

12

We're talking about some other agreement

MR. SHELLEY:

No.

We're talking about the

13

contract between us and the Government because it's

14

that contract that contains the reimbursement terms,

15

and when the enrollee enrolls in the Federal program,

16

he or she takes on the obligation of complying with all

17

the terms of the Government contract.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that may give

19

rise to a separate agreement, a related agreement, if

20

you will, between you and the employee.

21

-- it's not a -- you're not the Government.

22

employee is not the Government, at least not for these

23

purposes.

24
25

But it's not
The

So why is it a Government contract?
MR. SHELLEY:

Because the -- the underlying

terms are part of the Government contract and --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the Government

2

says -- Congress says, we think OPM should have a

3

recreation center for its employees and it should have

4

all these things, and then OPM enters into a contract

5

with a company that runs recreation centers -- okay --

6

that's a contract with the Government.

7

entity enters into a contract with somebody else to

8

supply the basketball hoops.

9

last contract is a Government contract?

Would you say that that

10

MR. SHELLEY:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. SHELLEY:

13
14

And then that

The subcontract?
Yes.

I would not say it's a contract

with the Government, and that's not our situation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even if the provision

15

-- even if at some point Congress said, and besides,

16

you know, the basketball hoops should be -- you know,

17

made in America as opposed to somewhere else and, you

18

know, specifies the terms of the subcontract.

19
20

MR. SHELLEY:

It's not a Government contract.

The Government contract is the contract between the

21

party with the Government, and that's what we have here

22

and that's what we're seeking to enforce.

23

But I would point out that cases like Jackson

24

Transit and the Central Airlines case -- the case --

25

the party suing wasn't really suing on the contract

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

even.

2

and as a result, the Court, nonetheless, held it arose

3

under Federal -- Federal law.

4

case is directly on the contract itself.

5

much closer connection to the Government terms.

It was -- the case emanated from the contract,

6

Under the --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this case, the -- the
So it's a

But there's nothing in the

8

statute that speaks about a Federal forum.

9

look at this entire picture, you're seeking

And if you

10

reimbursement, and you're seeking reimbursement based

11

on a tort recovery.

12

sensible, the most natural thing for a legislature, if

13

they thought about it, be to say, well, that claim for

14

reimbursement ought to come in on the coattails of the

15

tort claim?

16

Federal case out -- out of it.

17

these claims to be subject to a separate Federal case?

18

And why wouldn't the most

You don't need to make a whole separate

MR. SHELLEY:

Why would Congress want

Justice Ginsburg, every other

19

type of claim under this program is in Federal court

20

already, denials of benefits cases, disputes between

21

the carrier and the United States.

22

lawsuits, these reimbursement suits, are -- are left.

23

And it would be anomalous to -- for Congress to have

24

wanted those to be in State court.

25

Only a sliver of

But even aside from that, a Federal forum

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

offers the -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it's because there's

3

an anterior lawsuit that everything rides on that State

4

court suit.

5

you could claim reimbursement were it not for that

6

State court lawsuit.

7

There wouldn't be any recovery from which

MR. SHELLEY:

The reality is that a

8

straightforward Federal lawsuit and a Federal rule that

9

these -- these reimbursement provisions are

10

straightforwardly enforceable through Federal claims

11

means that they will -- the reimbursement will be

12

collected efficiently and correctly.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could you --

14

following up on Justice Ginsburg's question, could you

15

intervene asserting rights of subrogation in the

16

underlying tort suit that your covered beneficiary

17

brought in State court?

18

MR. SHELLEY:

Conceivably, but the Federal

19

question statute allows us to raise Federal claims in

20

Federal court, and through it, Congress has determined

21

that if the case turns on Federal law, that the Federal

22

forum is an appropriate forum for that.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, wouldn't it be

24

more efficient for you to intervene in the pending

25

State suit and get it all resolved at once rather than

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

waiting until your beneficiary gets a recovery and then

2

starting a whole other Federal suit over this somewhat

3

subsidiary subrogation point?

4

MR. SHELLEY:

No, because in many States --

5

many States don't allow reimbursement altogether.

6

have anti-subrogation policies as well, and the reality

7

is, is that what --

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They

Well, at that point,

you'd be able to assert your argument under the Federal

10

preemption provision that says, in my view somewhat

11

surprisingly, that these contract terms preempt State

12

law.

13

MR. SHELLEY:

Yes, and we've fought many

14

battles on those fronts in the State courts.

15

reality is that the Federal forum with its familiarity

16

with Federal law, its solicitude towards Federal law is

17

the appropriate forum in these cases, more so than the

18

State court.

19

And the

And what may seem like an efficient --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You don't have any

20

such problem here.

21

York law -- you certainly could have gone into that

22

lawsuit and --

23

There's no conflict between the New

MR. SHELLEY:

Well, no conflict is required,

24

for instance, under the Jackson Transit analysis.

25

analysis is, is this a pervasively Federal regime to

1

start with, and if so, it's a Federal claim whether

2

there's a conflict or not.

3

unnecessary.

And so a conflict is really

4

But the other point is that with the --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I could see if this were

6

-- what we were talking about everything is -- the

7

insurance of a Federal employee and questions about

8

coverage, questions about benefits, all of that between

9

the employee and the carrier.

But this comes up

10

because we have a third party who enters the picture in

11

an estate law claim.

12

say, well, everything is -- this whole thing is -- is

13

all a Federal contract.

14

So I don't think you can just

MR. SHELLEY:

Your Honor, there is no --

15

there's no requirement in the preemption provision

16

either for a conflict.

17

the -- to the drafting table in 1998 and said, we want

18

State law to be preempted whether or not there's a

19

conflict in this particular situation.

20

I mean, Congress went back to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So --

That would have been

21

a good time for them to say we want a Federal --

22

Federal court jurisdiction over these causes of actions

23

if that's what they had in mind, but they didn't do

24

that.

25

MR. SHELLEY:

Well, first of all, there have

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- there was no dispute whatsoever that these types of

2

cases could be brought in Federal court in 1998.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, there sure was.

4

For those who like to look at the legislative history,

5

the House report said that -- again, it's very curious

6

language.

the case in favor of Federal jurisdiction, or something

8

like that.

9
10

It said, this change will help strengthen

MR. SHELLEY:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, since when is

11

Congress trying to strengthen -- they either decide

12

it's going to be Federal jurisdiction or not.

13

don't try to make arguments.

14

MR. SHELLEY:

They

There had been no dispute about

whether reimbursement claims could be brought in

agreement on that.

18

whether denials of benefits cases could be removed from

19

State court to Federal court.

20

was it followed the ERISA model and changed the

21

preemption provision because the preemption provision

22

was what had been giving the courts problems about the

23

removal issue.

24

courts told it to do, was get rid of some language in

Congress did that and created Federal

Nonetheless, now we come up with a new
dispute that had never been a problem before -JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's sort of queer

6

terminology anyway. When Congress has already decided

7

that there should be Federal jurisdiction.

8

very strange for Congress to say this strengthens the

9

case for Federal -- what do you mean the case for

10

It would seem

Federal jurisdiction?

11

MR. SHELLEY:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think -We prescribe Federal

13

jurisdiction.

14

legislative history, but I -- I don't find that

15

particular piece very much against you.

16

may be just -- just the opposite.

17

lawyers' language, you know.

18

there's Federal jurisdiction or not, but this will make

19

a better case for -- you know, for the other side.

20

I -- you know, I'm not a fan of

MR. SHELLEY:

In fact, it

It may be -- it's

We don't know whether

I think Congress enacted the

21

statute in 1995 against the backdrop of -- of settled

22

law that Federal programs are typically litigated in

23

Federal court.

24
25

What happened, though, was that the States
started -- started enacting provisions in the area and

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress went to work in 1978 and enacted a preemption

2

provision to reemphasize what I -- what it believed in

3

the first instance.

4

Then in 1998, after courts continued even to

5

interpret the preemption provision narrowly, they went

6

back to the -- they went back to the -- to the statute

7

and they strengthened it even further to make it

8

absolutely clear.

9

So I think what we have is a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the -- the

10

purpose of the preemption provision in this statute was

11

related to benefits and coverage.

12

mandatory coverage for this or that.

13

mentioned is the chiropractor.

14

Federal scheme, the Federal administrator didn't want

15

to be saddled with whatever the particular packages

16

that the States had.

17

-- those were to be determined on the Federal level,

18

and you weren't supposed to be saddled with whatever

19

the State thought would be good to have in the plan.

20

Some States have
The case that was

And the -- in the

So the coverage and the benefits

But the provision doesn't read

Is --

Yes, but -- but -- I'm

sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there any

6

comparable situation where a contract between two

7

private parties has the effect of preempting State law?

8
9

Suppose all you have to do in your service benefit plan
is agree with your beneficiaries that in the case of

10

subrogation, you're entitled to, you know, 10 times

11

actual damages, if they don't pay up right away or

12

something like that.

13

all sorts of State law.

14

entitled to interest at 20 percent and that would

15

preempt State usury laws?

16

And -- and that would override

MR. SHELLEY:

You could specify you're

Well, I believe there are many

17

other statutes in the benefits area involving the

18

Federal Government from long-term care to miliary

19

benefits which have a similar preemption provision.

20

think it --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

It's a sloppy way to put it,

22

don't you think?

23

although Congress doesn't always speak precisely, is

24

that any -- any State law which contradicts a provision

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
An action to enforce the terms of a FEHBA

contract is a Federal action because the rights and

2

duties in FEHBA contracts are Federal in nature under

3

the Jackson Transit inquiry.

4

The Federal nature of the rights and duties

5

comes both from the context in which FEHBA operates and

6

also from the terms of the express preemption

7

provision.

8
9

Briefly -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

that a big leap?

Isn't there -- isn't

I mean, even if we agree with you

10

that there are Federal rights and duties, is it

11

irrational for Congress to determine, since they arise

12

in a normal breach of contract action, we're going to

13

assume they're going to be brought in State court?

14

cause of action is for breach of contract that every

15

State recognizes.

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

The

Well, I guess that seems

17

like an unlikely outcome, given that under the express

18

terms of the preemption provision, it's clear that the

19

contract terms are matters of Federal law in the sense

20

that Federal law dictates that they govern over State

21

law.

22

substantive rule of decision with respect to the

23

construction of the contract, it seems anomalous to

24

impute to Congress the intention that those Federal

25

rights and duties should be litigated solely in a State

And if we know that Federal law provides a

court action.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But wouldn't it have

3

been the easiest thing for Congress to say, as it does

4

countless times when it creates Federal rights, that

5

Federal courts have jurisdiction to enforce these

6

rights?

7

And they didn't do that here.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, they didn't do that,

8

but I think as Jackson Transit explains, it's -- it's

9

different in the contract context than in your standard

10

implied cause of action context for the following

11

reason.

12

construction of contracts, as it did in FEHBA, it

13

clearly contemplates that those contracts will be

14

enforceable somewhere.

15

for breach.

16

action sounds in State law or instead in Federal law.

When Congress specifically contemplates the

So there is a cause of action

The only question is whether that cause of

17

And on that question, when Congress

18

prescribes, as it did in the preemption provision, that

19

the rights and duties are matters of Federal law, it

20

seems most likely that Congress intended there would be

21

a Federal cause of action that could be brought in

22

Federal court to litigate those terms.

23

Congress did in the terms of the preemption provision.

right that when -- and when an employee asks for

We're going to have to sort out

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I don't know that it's

going to be a -- a terribly difficult inquiry because

18

of the precision with which the terms of the preemption

provision speaks.

20

with respect to the reimbursement obligation because it

fits --

And it's certainly not difficult

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, ERISA has a

very clear preemption provision too, and that's

generated a fair amount of work for us.

It has, but in terms of --

I don't.

I'm sorry?
I didn't think Boyle went

that far.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, Boyle at least

18

establishes that the terms of a contract preempted

19

State law because it was a procurement contract and the

20

idea was that by complying with the terms of the

21

procurement contract, the contractor asserted

essentially a federally compelled defense to the State

5

I -- I've never seen it -- are there other

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't know that there are

6

other statutes, but what this particular -- particular

7

provision indicates is that Congress thought it was

8

very important that FEHBA contracts would control over

9

State law, and I don't think there's any constitutional

10

limitation on Congress' ability to do that.

11

--

12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

After all

I -- I wrote Boyle and what

I thought I was saying was that the common --

14

(Laughter.)

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- was that the common law,

16

Federal common law precluded, preempted any State law

17

which contradicted this contract.

18

can put that in a sloppy fashion by saying that the

19

contract preempted State law, but it wasn't --

Now, you can -- you

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- that we thought it was

And you can read this statute the same way.

It's a sloppy way of putting it, but what it means is

Federal law preempts any State provision that is

contrary to a provision of the contract --

precise, is it?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any significant

variation among the different carriers as to the terms

16

of the contracts they use in different places for

Federal employees?

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

On which particular --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Under this program.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

There's -- there's

that have very detailed provisions as to what the

The statute has fairly close detail as to

And they have written regs

MR. SRINIVASAN:

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I'm trying to figure out

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

The statute doesn't give a

great deal of specific --

JUSTICE BREYER:

It gives some.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

terminology.

It gives some.

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It gives some, but it's only

19

bare bones, Justice Breyer.

20
21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, I know, but I'm trying

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But I think that's important

--

22
23

because what -- what Congress has done is essentially

24

to leave it to OPM to negotiate the terms of these

25

contracts.

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Insofar as the individual

2

carriers write contracts with their covered employees,

3

i.e., me and you and other people, and there's a lot of

4

variation, I would say there's a lot of private going

5

on.

6

what OPM says, then it looks more to me like a regular

7

Federal program.

But insofar as those contracts are dictated by

8

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, those --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I'm trying to get a

10
11

handle on that.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

The contracts between the

12

individual and the carrier are dictated by OPM in some

13

sense because OPM negotiates the terms that bind the

14

individual. So, the contract that you and I enter into

15

when we sign on for health insurance is a part of the

16

-- of the program, if you will, that's negotiated by

17

OPM with the carrier.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

So in other words, when I

19

sign a contract, or anyone who's a Federal employee,

20

it's OPM who effectively sets those terms?

21

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right, in negotiation

22

with the carrier, and the statement of benefits is

23

essentially the program.

24

you're entitled to and it tells you what obligations

25

you're encumbered by when you take on those benefits.

It tells you what benefits

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

And one of the obligations that you're encumbered by

2

under the clear terms of this contract is the

3

obligation to reimburse the carrier in the event --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I understand.

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- that you receive benefits

6

and then subsequently receive benefits from a third

7

party.

8
9

And one thing that I don't want to lose sight
of is that ultimately this concerns money that will be

10

reimbursed to the Federal Treasury.

11

that this case happens to involve litigation between

12

two private parties shouldn't obscure the strength of

13

the Government's interest in the area, given that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. STOCK

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22

MR. STOCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
I must confess that I continue to be

23

perplexed by the claim that Congress intended

24

reimbursement claims of this type to be handled and --

25

and to be dealt with in the Federal courts when that

It's quite possible no one

in Congress thought about this --

6

MR. STOCK:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

It -- it --- which is common.

So if

8

it is common, why is it that we would not use the same

9

approach that the Court used in Clearfield Trust, in

10

Kimbell Foods, and really look to the nature of the

11

contract?

12

get the money.

employees.

16

uniformity throughout the Nation, et cetera, et cetera.

17

Whereas here, the rights at stake are really

We have a statute.

It covers only Federal

Should -- there are strong interests in

So what is the difference between this case,

18

other than a technical difference?

19

The title is not United States.

25

I concede that one.

It's Blue Cross Blue

Shield or whatever.

21

23

We have all those

No.
Empire, et cetera.

But

aside from that, why is it different?
MR. STOCK:

Because, Your Honor, in the first

instance, number one, uniformity really is not a -- a

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

legitimate claim in this -- in this instance by Blue

2

Cross and Blue Shield.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. STOCK:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why -- why?

Because -The obvious reason for

6

uniformity would be you are a Federal employee, whether

7

you're in Alaska or whether you're in Virginia.

8

MR. STOCK:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct, Your Honor.
And it's unreasonable to

10

think Congress would want the rights of those different

11

Federal employees to differ just because of where they

12

live.

13

And so what's the answer to that?
MR. STOCK:

It -- the fact of the matter is,

14

is the way Blue Cross has written this reimbursement

15

provision, they will differ.

16

provision, which -- by the way, to start with, the

17

reimbursement provision that is in the Blue Cross Blue

18

-- Blue Cross Blue Shield contract with the employees

19

is different than the reimbursement provisions which

20

are described in the contract between OPM and Blue

21

Cross Blue Shield.

22

ways, the first way being that, with respect to

23

procurement costs and the issue of this $157,000, who

pays to obtain that.

The reimbursement

disbursements to be paid by the Government and the --

2

and the claim -- the reimbursement claim to be

3

reduced by that.

4

In the Blue Cross Blue Shield version of that

5

between Blue Cross Blue Shield and the -- the litigant

6

here, that provision is changed.

7

they then undercut their own claim for uniformity.

8

They basically say that we'll allow you attorney's fees

9

if we feel like it in a particular case.

10
11

And this is why I say

That's not a

uniformity provision.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you're saying that

12

there is a uniformity between a master contract between

13

the United States and Blue Cross on the one hand, and

14

Blue Cross and the subscriber on the other hand.

15

doesn't the United States approve the latter contract?

16

But

In other words, doesn't it -- well, I forget the

17

initials -- OPM or whatever it is.

18

-- a requirement of approval going to the terms of the

19

contract between Empire and -- and the employee before

20

that contract goes into effect?

21

MR. STOCK:

22
23

Doesn't it have a

I'm not sure what the mechanics

are of it, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't that -- isn't that

24

crucial, though, in your answer to Justice Breyer?

25

Because if the United States -- if OPM approves the

33
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Empire employee contract, maybe you can say, well, gee,

2

there's something strange going on at OPM that they don't

3

require exactly the same terms in the contract with the

4

employee that they -- that they require in their master

5

contract with -- with Empire.

6

anything one way or the other about the interest of the

7

United States in having uniformity in which the -- in

8

the -- in the interpretation and application of

9

contracts, which they do approve, between Empire, other

10
11

But it doesn't say

Blue Cross Blue Shield entities, and their employees.
MR. STOCK:

Well, I think when we're talking

12

about uniformity, Your Honor, because this is a statute

13

designed to benefit Federal employees, that we're

14

talking about uniformity in the context of all Federal

15

employees are treated the same.

16

Blue Cross Blue --

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The provision that

And the United States is

18

treated the same in relation to all Federal employees.

19

I mean, there's -- there's an interest in uniformity

20

for fairness among employees, and there's an interest

21

in the United States in having the same expectation, in

22

this case a reimbursement expectation, no matter where

23

the employee is.

24
25

MR. STOCK:

That's correct.

terms of uniformity, the provision that Blue Cross --

several provisions that Blue Cross Blue Shield has

2

added to this reimbursement clause undercut the

3

uniformity aspect of it.

4

particular case, we'll decide, well, the fellow from

5

Alaska -- we'll give him his attorney's fees and

6

disbursements, but the fellow from New York, we won't

7

give it to, you undercut any -- any --

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And when you say in a

That's uniform in both

Alaska and New York, they are subject to the -- to the

10

Blue Cross waiver of attorney's fees or not.

11

being treated uniformly.

12

disuniform.

13

They're

I don't see that that's

What is disuniform, it seems to me, is that

14

you have an employee who wins a judgment in Alaska and

15

he gets to keep all his money because Alaska law says

16

the reimbursement provision is -- is invalid, and then

17

you have a Federal employee in Texas who -- who gets a

18

-- wins the same tort lawsuit, and he has to turn over

19

to Blue Cross all the -- the portion of his recovery

20

that would cover the outlay that Blue Cross has made.

21

That's disuniformity.

22

MR. STOCK:

The -- the uniformity which we're

23

seeking, relative to these benefits, and the -- and the

24

argument as to uniformity I would submit to you, at

25

least as to how we treat the Federal employees, is

35
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

illusory in this case because no matter how this Court

2

decides in this particular case, whether there's

3

Federal jurisdiction here or not, the employees are

4

being treated differently State to State based upon the

5

provision that Blue Cross Blue Shield has enacted.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I suppose that

7

the preemption provision would apply equally if this

8

were brought in State court or Federal court.

9

MR. STOCK:

Correct?

Yes, Your Honor.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I'm curious --

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Your -- your answer to -- to

12

Justice Scalia -- I'm sorry -- just did not register.

13

I don't understand --

14

MR. STOCK:

Well, it was incomplete, Your

15

Honor, because I -- I had turned around to answer the

16

Chief Justice.

17

The -- the way they have this set up with the

18

right of reimbursement and the -- and the kickers that

19

Blue Cross Blue Shield puts in the statement of

20

benefits creates a situation.

21

these rights of reimbursement apply no matter how the

22

cause of action for damages is delineated, in other

23

words, whether it's seeking damages for medical

24

benefits or damages for pain and suffering.

25

Blue Cross Blue Shield has introduced is that -- that

They -- they add that

And what

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

kicker.
And -- and what that does, in effect, from

3

State to State is change the outcome for the employee

4

because, for instance, in New York where we have a

5

collateral source rule by statute that says, you may

6

not prove medical damages in a personal injury case for

7

which you've collected insurance.

8

Denise McVeigh's case, I can't prove her medical bills.

9

So, for instance, in

Yet, Blue Cross Blue Shield is going to come in and

10

pick Denise Finn's pocket on her claim for pain and

11

suffering for the $157,000 in medical bills that they

12

say they've paid.

13

Whereas, if I go across the river -- and I

14

don't know the law in New Jersey, but assuming that New

15

Jersey uses the older rule where, if I had the good

16

sense to buy myself medical insurance and I collected

17

medical insurance for the benefits that were -- if I

18

collect the medical payments for the medical bills, I

19

can still go into court and prove those medical bills

20

as against the tortfeasor.

21

instance, Blue Cross Blue Shield comes in and it takes

22

money at least that I've gotten from the other side as

23

opposed to in New York where they take money that I

24

haven't gotten from the other side.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In that particular

Yes, but do they take money

There's uniformity because

the Government wins in both cases.

12

MR. STOCK:

I have to concede that that's

13

true, and if that is the uniformity that we seek and

14

the only --

uniformity the Government loves.

MR. STOCK:

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

(Laughter.)

22

MR. STOCK:

23

Denise Finn doesn't.

25

I'm sure they do.

I -- I wasn't thinking of

that kind of uniformity.

21

24

I mean, that's the kind of

I assure you, Your Honor, that

JUSTICE BREYER:

I was thinking of the

contract -- the contracts that the carriers enter into

38
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

with the individual Federal employees in different

2

places.

3

contracts all read the same or they don't.

4

you have found one example of where they read

5

differently.

6

reimburse us, you can subtract attorney's fees, and

7

others say when you reimburse us maybe you can subtract

8

attorney's fees, depending on how we feel about it.

9

And I grant you that is a difference.

And I'm trying to get an idea of whether those

10

And so far,

Some contracts apparently say when you

And I am curious, as was Justice Souter, as

11

to whether you have to get OPM approval for that

12

difference or whether OPM can tell you, knock it off,

13

we want the same.

14

And also I'd like other examples.

What I'm trying to do, to be clear about it,

15

is I'm trying to see how similar this is to the

16

instance of the Federal employee checks, which this

17

Court many, many years ago said, when you pay your

18

Federal employees and you write a check, it's Federal

19

law that's going to govern the interpretation of the

20

endorsement.

21

different.

22

I want to see how similar it is and how

I have two differences.

One is the name on

23

this case is Empire, not United States, and the second

24

difference is the one you just mentioned about may

25

rather than must.

Now, are there others?

1

MR. STOCK:

There are differences in my

2

understanding, Your Honor, from State to State between

3

the different Blue Cross entities.

4

what exactly those differences are, but my

5

understanding is that these Blue Cross policies vary

6

from State to State.

7

I couldn't tell you

Do they vary -- I -- I think, Your Honor,

8

although it supports my contention, that you may have

9

misunderstood what I said about the -- the difference

10

between the reimbursement clauses, honestly.

11

what I indicated was the -- the reimbursement clause

12

that is in the OPM/Blue Cross contract is different

13

from what Blue Cross then enters into with its members.

14

That differs.

What I --

I was not asserting that it differs

15

from State to State.

16

effect of that differs from State to State certainly.

17

What I'm saying is that the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May -- may I ask this?

18

Because I think your example overlooks the fact that at

19

least your opponent claims that the Blue Cross contract

20

provision would preempt the New York law that denies

21

your client recovery for health benefits.

22

MR. STOCK:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24
25

It does -I think that would be their

answer to your example.
MR. STOCK:

It -- it would be in error, I

believe, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, if we -- if we think

3

Congress can provide that a contract provision would

4

preempt a State law, it seems to me the example you've

5

given is the precise example that that statute was

6

intended to cover.

7

MR. STOCK:

The -- at the -- at the very

8

essence of that, I don't believe that a contract can

9

preempt State law.

The constitutional laws of the

10

United States can preempt State law.

11

can bootstrap a contract into that by some theory, I

12

suppose you could argue that it -- that it --

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If somehow you

But if -- if it does, it

14

would eliminate the lack of uniformity on which you

15

rely.

16

MR. STOCK:

It -- it would not, Your Honor,

17

in this instance because the -- the operation of that

18

statute does not affect their right to reimbursement

19

under their contract provision.

It affects the --

amount that your client can recover.

indicated would occur during a trial of the case and in

terms of my cause of action.

10
11

It would not affect Blue

Cross' lawsuit against my client.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

But the defendant

12

would say, we don't have to pay those damages because

13

they're covered by insurance.

14

be, well, they're not -- they -- they are only covered

Yes, they wouldn't be a party to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but the

21

preemption provision, at least with respect to the

22

rights of Empire, would ensure uniformity.

24

any impediment to recovery by Empire that varies from

State to State would be overridden.

interest in uniformity we have, again, is whether the

may fly.

19

employees are treated and in the manner in which ladies

is -- is out the window under these -- under this --

MR. STOCK:

it clearly does not because this case, involving Blue

4

issues of the construction or interpretation of a

5

Federal statute, but issue -- the issues involved in

6

our case are whether they're entitled to collect the

11

In addition, our dispute involves whether or

15

paid and trying to be a little cute and collect those

17

Those are the issues.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. STOCK:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I would have thought

the issue is whether Federal law governs this --

MR. STOCK:

I don't know that I would, but I

14

think the caveat to that is if the Federal Government

15

were running it themselves, pursuant to a different

16

statute than we have here, the first thing I think I

would look at is what jurisdiction or what the Congress

had to say about where they wanted cases arising from

that.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. STOCK:

Yes.

Our defense on the merits to this

paid the same doctor $17,500 three times for the same

12

service, and that Denise Finn should not be required to

reimburse Blue Cross Blue Shield when they have

14

incompetently, in effect, paid out more money than they

15

should have.

16

The second defense involves the fact that

seeking reimbursement for are not connected to the

accident that injured Mr. McVeigh.

I think we do.

I don't believe -- and -- and honestly, I -- I did not

believe it requires their approval. They don't get a

we talk about uniformity, that that's what we ought be

talking about.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I guess you can be --

7

depending upon how detailed the OPM contract is, you

can be consistent with that contract and still have an

enormous amount of variation from one to another.

understanding is that -- is for that reason that OPM

MR. STOCK:

Yes.

It could.

whether that should get different interpretations
