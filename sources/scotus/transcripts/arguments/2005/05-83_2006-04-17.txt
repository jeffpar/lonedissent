ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. WHISMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. WHISMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When a judge, rather than a jury, decides a

11

fact that increases the defendant's punishment above

12

the applicable standard range, the Sixth Amendment's

13

jury trial right is violated.

14

of whether the fact is called an element or whether it

15

is called a sentencing factor because elements and

16

sentencing factors are functionally equivalent under

17

the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

18

It follows that the same harmless error rule

This is true regardless

19

that applies to missing or misdescribed elements should

20

also apply to missing or misdescribed sentencing

21

enhancements.

22

In a series of Washington decisions, the

23

Washington Supreme Court has held that harmless error

24

analysis may never be conducted as to a missing or

25

misdescribed sentencing enhancement simply because it

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is called a sentencing enhancement.

2

absolute prohibition is inconsistent with this Court's

3

jurisprudence and should be corrected.

4

This rule of

Before I go on, however, to explain the legal

5

basis and the flaws in the legal reasoning of the

6

Washington State Supreme Court, I would like to take a

7

brief moment to address a few State law issues that

8

have been raised by the Respondent's brief.

9

The first is the question of whether or not

10

at all in Washington we can, at present, seek deadly

11

weapon enhancements or, more specifically, firearm

12

enhancements.

13

that we cannot, and I'd just point out to the Court

14

that there is no authority in Washington for that

15

proposition.

16

the -- the firearm enhancement that was originally

17

imposed in this case does not constitute imposing a

18

sentence that would any way be inconsistent with

19

Washington law.

20

It was alleged in the Respondent's brief

And so asking this Court to simply affirm

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

On -- on that point, I have

21

-- I have one question.

22

appendix, the Washington Supreme Court's opinion is set

23

forth, and in the course of that opinion, it says, to

24

the contrary, when defense counsel argued the

25

definition should have been submitted to the jury, the

At page 3a of the petition

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

prosecutor explicitly stated that the method under

2

which the State is alleging and the jury found assault

3

was committed was by the use of a deadly weapon.

4

then he goes on to say, in the crime charged in the

5

enhancement, the State alleged there is no element of a

6

firearm.

The element is assault with a deadly weapon.

7

I don't -- this was at the sentencing

8

proceeding, I take it?

9

MR. WHISMAN:

10

I believe that's correct, Your

Honor.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

find it in the sentencing proceeding.

13

And

MR. WHISMAN:

Yes, because I couldn't

In the -- in a subsequent or

14

nearly subsequent breath, the prosecutor then asked for

15

the enhancement, the 36-month enhancement, that applies

16

for firearms.

17

the prosecutor was responding to the -- to defense

18

counsel's use of the term element.

19

year 2000, before Apprendi, before Blakely, we never

20

would have used that term as applied to a sentencing

21

enhancement.

22

Now, we have since changed our thinking, obviously,

23

after Apprendi.

24
25

I think what you're seeing there is that

And in -- in the

We just didn't think of it that way.

But I think if you -- on the -- on the
overall point, if you look at defense counsel's

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

comments beginning with the comments pretrial, where he

2

notes that I can see no relevance to -- to the

3

admission of a different gun.

4

Recuenco was threatened with a 380 automatic with a

5

clip.

6

JA, page 30 says, the allegation and the basis on which

7

this case was tried was under a theory of firearm.

8

JA 37, counsel said, the firearm is an element of this

9

offense as it has been pleaded and argued to the jury

10

and evidently, perhaps, obviously proven to the jury.

11

So --

Then he comments, Ms.

Regarding the charge in particular, counsel at

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

At

It does sound as if he

13

thinks there was -- the prosecutor thought there was no

14

error.

15

A deadly weapon is a deadly weapon, and then -MR. WHISMAN:

That's right.

And -- and I

16

think, Your Honor, that stems from the -- from the way

17

the statutes are structured.

18

years ago, in Washington we had what we called a deadly

19

weapon enhancement.

20

between any kind of weapon.

21

Beginning many, many

And so there was no distinction made
In 1995, the law changed.

There was a distinction made as to firearms.

The --

22

the penalty was increased as to firearms.

23

beginning that time, there was a material distinction

24

depending on the weapon that was used.

25

that --

And so

But I think

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Was deadly weapon still an

2

enhancement at that point, or was deadly weapon part of

3

the definition of a new crime?

4

MR. WHISMAN:

Deadly weapon was still called

5

an enhancement, Your Honor, under the statute.

6

the statute defined deadly weapon very generally, and

7

then in the punishment section, the punishment

8

provisions, which specifically were formerly under

9

section 310 of the Sentencing Reform Act -- now it's

And so

10

been renumbered to be 533.

11

have two provisions, one which provides the punishment

12

for deadly -- for firearms, and under this -- for this

13

case, that would be 3 years.

14

it says if someone was armed with a deadly weapon other

15

than a firearm, you have a lesser penalty.

16

Under that provision -- you

And then as to the rest,

So as I say, I think that for a long time we

17

have treated -- in Washington, we've treated all of

18

these things as deadly weapons, but recognized that if

19

it was a firearm, the penalty was greater than if it

20

were something other than a firearm.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the deadly weapon

22

-- the definition of deadly weapon -- that that could

23

include a revolver or a pistol.

24

describing now deadly weapon.

25

that excludes guns.

You -- you seem to be
That's one thing, and

And then firearm, a discrete

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

category.

2

least pistols and revolvers.

3

But I thought that deadly weapon includes at

MR. WHISMAN:

A firearm includes pistols and

4

revolvers because a firearm is something -- anything

5

from which a projectile is fired.

6
7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- but didn't the deadly

weapon -- definition of deadly weapon include firearms?

8
9

So --

MR. WHISMAN:

That's the way it was defined

to the jury in this case.

That's correct, Justice

10

Ginsburg.

11

instructions went to the jury to find deadly weapon as

12

a firearm.

13

especially in the instructions conference, that the --

14

there's no question but that the only weapon here is a

15

firearm, and so they used the simplified version of the

16

instructions.

It was -- it was -- the -- the jury

And over and over, the court reiterated,

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wasn't -But with a 1 -- 1-year

19

enhancement or -- I thought that that could apply in a

20

case where the deadly weapon was a gun.

21

MR. WHISMAN:

No.

Our -- our position, Your

22

Honor, is that it cannot, that if -- you either have a

23

firearm or you have no enhancement whatsoever.

24

the only way that a -- that a gun could be a -- it's --

25

it's because of the language, other than a firearm.

If --

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

So, in other words, you have either a firearm and a 3

2

year enhancement, or you have, as I say, no -- no

3

weapon enhancement at all.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, in other words -Well, would it be either

5

proper or required by the Washington trial court to

6

tell the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the

7

charge is assault?

8

sentence enhancement.

It's a 1-year enhancement if

9

it's a deadly weapon.

It's a 3-year enhancement if

There is also the possibility of a

10

it's a firearm and a pistol is a firearm.

11

judge err if he did that?

12

the same question, would it be proper for the judge to

13

leave out the 1-year deadly weapon instruction and just

14

instruct you can -- you must determine whether it's an

15

assault and you must determine whether there's a 3-year

16

enhancement for the use of a firearm?

17

MR. WHISMAN:

Would the

Or another way of putting

We believe that's exactly what

18

the court did in this case, Your Honor, by -- by

19

instructing the jury that deadly weapon is firearm.

20

Washington, we never tell the jury --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

In

My hypothetical is

22

he says it's a 3-year enhancement if the deadly weapon

23

is a firearm.

24

under Washington law, is it error if the judge allows

25

the definition of deadly weapon also to go to the jury

That's -- what I'm asking is, in effect,

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

so it can find a lesser included offense.

2
3

MR. WHISMAN:
parts to the answer.

4

Well, there -- there are two

Let me answer that one first.

There -- our position is there is no lesser

5

included offense of a firearm that's still a deadly

6

weapon.

7

that was one of the cases reversed in the Recuenco

8

case, you'll see that -- that they explain why that's

9

the case.

10
11

And if you look at State v. Olney, O-l-n-e-y,

In other words, it's either a firearm or

there's no enhancement whatsoever.
The -- the other part of the question I

12

wanted to just clarify is that in Washington, we would

13

not be telling the jury the length of time that -- that

14

the defendant would face --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then you're saying

16

the instruction here was proper.

17

MR. WHISMAN:

I'm saying that the

18

instructions that went to the jury, correct, were --

19

were proper.

20

What was improper in this case is that the

21

special verdict form did not sufficiently or

22

specifically enough preserve the jury's verdict so

23

that, in other words, when the jury passed on this case

24

and returned a verdict form that said deadly weapon,

25

that did not expressly encompass the firearm.

And so

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- and that was -- that was the -- the mistake that was

2

made in this case.

3

form to the jury that would -- that would let a jury

4

expressly describe what the verdict was.

5

We should have submitted a verdict

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could you -- could you

6

clarify one thing for me?

7

have it in mind correctly.

8

firearm has to be an operable firearm?

9

MR. WHISMAN:

I just want to be sure I
Is it correct that the

That portion of the Washington

10

law, Your Honor, isn't -- isn't crystal clear, but what

11

I can say is that that's not in this case because trial

12

counsel at -- at trial in more than one occasion

13

specifically said it was irrelevant to this case.

14

we have to prove is that the firearm was a real gun,

15

and --

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What

But is -- just again, I'm

17

not trying to find out the answer to what happened

18

here, but just as a matter of what the law provides.

19

Is it conceivable that a -- a gun which was not

20

operable could nevertheless be a deadly weapon because

21

it can be used as a club?

22
23

MR. WHISMAN:

In that circumstance, yes, Your

Honor.

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

MR. WHISMAN:

It could be.

But -- but obviously, as

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

counsel -- on page JA 31 and at JA 38, counsel very

2

specifically said the State tries to say that the

3

nonworking firearm would also be the basis for this

4

offense, and certainly it can be.

5

page 38, they say, obviously, the question of whether

6

it actually worked or not would be irrelevant under the

7

law.

8

operability wasn't before the jury.

9

And then at -- at

So the -- strictly speaking, the question of

We did have to prove that it was real.

And,

10

of course, there was never any dispute about that.

11

defendant's -- by the defendant's own testimony, for

12

example, in the -- in the transcript at page 677 --

13

that would be volume 8, on 1/24/2000, page 677 -- the

14

defendant spoke at some length about the fact that he

15

was worried about his children getting a hold of this

16

gun.

17

680, he talked about how he locks it up all the time.

18

There were significant safety concerns.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

At page

Would you explain again

19

why it was irrelevant whether the gun was operable or

20

not?

21

MR. WHISMAN:

Operability, Your Honor, is --

22

is -- there were a series of cases that -- that arose

23

in Washington having to do with -- with a gun that was

24

basically a real gun, but that there was something

25

technically wrong with it.

And those series of cases

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

discussed how soon it could be rendered operable to make

2

it still constitute a real gun.

3

kind of an esoteric area of the law.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

But I think that's really

But to be a real gun, it

has to be operable.

6

MR. WHISMAN:

Well, that's what the -- what

7

the cases have said is that it only has to be ready --

8

could be made ready to -- to fire in a short amount of

9

time, yes.

As I say, that's simply not in this case

10

because counsel conceded this gun -- that operability

11

wasn't an issue here.

12

was a real gun.

13

All we had to prove was that it

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, did you have to prove

14

that because, as -- as I have assumed, the charge

15

included the statement that he had used a handgun?

16

that the term used?

17

MR. WHISMAN:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

MR. WHISMAN:

Was

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.

The charging document said the

20

defendant was armed with a deadly weapon, which

21

establishes the general category, and then, to wit, a

22

handgun.

23

-- either pretrial or throughout the course of the

24

trial that counsel knew precisely what he was facing.

25

As I say, there -- there was no issue either

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But all that the jury

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

found was deadly weapon because that's all they were

2

asked to find.

3

MR. WHISMAN:

That's right.

They only used

4

the terms, deadly weapon, Your Honor, and that's why in

5

the Washington State Supreme Court, we conceded that,

6

technically speaking, the jury's verdict didn't

7

encompass the firearm finding.

8

didn't encompass the firearm finding.

9

facts and circumstances of this case, it's our -- our

The express verdict
But under the

10

view that that error, even though it could be an error,

11

is harmless.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you -- you could -- it

13

could be argued that it not only didn't encompass the

14

firearm finding, but it excluded the firearm finding.

15

If, as you tell us, there are two categories, one being

16

deadly weapon, which does not include firearm, and the

17

other being firearm, wouldn't you say that the jury

18

verdict positively contradicted?

19

MR. WHISMAN:

I think, Your Honor, Justice

20

Scalia, if you imagine a situation, as Justice Kennedy

21

was posing, where the jury was presented with two

22

options and they were going to choose one or the other,

23

you might be able to make that argument.

24
25

But here, the jury was presented only with
the definition saying deadly weapon is a firearm,

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

whether loaded or not.

2

and under the circumstances where the only weapon

3

associated with this assault is a firearm, the only

4

thing that they could have premised their decision on

5

was the firearm.

6

And under those circumstances

So, as I say, it's not as though they were

7

choosing either or.

8

you might have had that situation.

9
10

In Justice Kennedy's hypothetical,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is the jury given a

copy of the information?

11

MR. WHISMAN:

They are ordinarily read a copy

12

of the information, Your Honor, at the start of the

13

case.

14

in the transcript as -- as the court has it.

15

the ordinary course of proceedings.

I don't recall that being transcribed in the -That is

16

In -- in the Respondent's brief, there is a

17

fair amount of time spent on distinguishing this case

18

or -- or trying to analogize this case actually to

19

charging defects.

20

past few minutes, I believe that this case simply

21

doesn't present that issue because it was readily

22

apparent that this defendant was fully advised of what

23

he was facing.

24
25

And as I've indicated already for the

Now, if there were other defects -- if there
were true defects in the charging document or if the

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

defendant was surprised by the sentence that the judge

2

ultimately imposed, then we would have to analyze,

3

separately analyze, whether or not the charging document

4

was sufficient.

5

and under Washington law, that is a separate analysis, a

6

separate analysis --

7

And under this Court's jurisprudence

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why was deadly weapon put

8

in by the prosecutor at all?

9

that this is not a deadly weapon case, this is strictly

If -- if you're right

10

a firearm case, it's not a lesser included, here the

11

prosecutor charged deadly weapon --

12

MR. WHISMAN:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Correct.
--

to wit, a handgun.

14

And then the special verdict form doesn't say one word

15

about firearm.

16

they charged the main thing?

17

deadly weapon, and they asked the jury to find deadly

18

weapon.

19

So couldn't the defendant expect, well,

MR. WHISMAN:

They charged me with

And -- and I think to answer

20

that question, Your Honor, again we have to step back

21

to the year 2000 and -- pre-Apprendi, et cetera.

22

that time, there were a series of cases, Meggyesy,

23

Olney and Rai, R-a-i, that -- that are overturned,

24

quite frankly, by the Recuenco opinion, where the

25

appellate courts had quite expressly said that it was

At

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

sufficient to submit the deadly weapon verdict form in

2

that form to a jury where it's clear that the only

3

weapon at issue was a firearm.

In each one of those

4

cases, that was what was done.

And in fact, in at

5

least one of them, the victim was shot, so there

6

couldn't be any question.

7

well-established practice in Washington law at the time

8

of proving that sort of thing.

9

So there was -- there was a

Now, it's true that the more thorough

10

practice, the more precise practice would have been to

11

submit a verdict form that said firearm, but that

12

wasn't done in this case, but it wasn't done, I

13

believe, pursuant to those cases.

14

Unless the Court has any additional

15

questions, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for

16

rebuttal.

In Apprendi and Blakely, this Court held that

no distinction between elements that set a maximum

punishment, sentencing elements, and elements of the

7

underlying offense.

For that reason, the failure to submit an
element that sets the sentence to the maximum sentence

10

available should be subject to exact same harmless

11

error analysis that was applied in Neder.

12

same constitutional value and constitutional right is

13

at stake.

14

the error will be applied by the court, and it's the same

sort of discrete error in time that you had in Neder.

There's no functional distinction between Neder.

Court held that the failure to submit a sentencing

into question the fairness, accuracy, or reliability of

21

the underlying proceeding.

In Cotton, this Court held that that same

type of error does not impugn the integrity, public

this one question?

finding, it's probably supported by the evidence and

presumably the jury would have come out the same way?

Would there ever be a case where it

Isn't it -- wouldn't it be reasonable for the

MS. MILLETT:

No, I don't -- I don't think

that's true, Justice Stevens, that there will be times

11

will be --

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But there might be a rare

13

case, but in about 95 percent of the cases, wouldn't it

14

be true that the fact the judge made the finding is

15

pretty good evidence that the jury would have made the

16

same finding?

17

MS. MILLETT:

I think it will depend on

whether the evidence was disputed before the judge in a

in fact, what would happen in cases like this and a lot

uncontested facts -- and we know that because they had

at the time the briefs were written, Washington law is

So you're -- I'm sorry.

10

You're saying their argument is wrong, in effect, as a

12

MS. MILLETT:

I think that's right, but even

13

if it weren't, if -- if you had some State that decided

14

not to fix its law, in light of Apprendi and Blakely, I

expect that what would happen is defendants would bring

There's no question of willfulness here.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand what --

it is to assume that that's a reason to make harmless

error not available to these types of errors across the

board.

5

And I don't think the way to deal with

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The assumption of the

hypothetical is, I take it, that the Washington State

7

judges would deliberately violate our holding of a

MS. MILLETT:

They would, and I think that's

11

not a fair assumption and it's certainly not the way to

decide whether harmless error analysis should apply.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That -Suppose the -- suppose the

judge didn't ask about deadly weapon at all, just --

just asked whether there's an assault.

5

MS. MILLETT:

Well, the -- it's assault in

6

the second degree which requires -- itself requires use

7

of a deadly weapon.

8

the second degree under Washington law without the jury

finding a deadly weapon.

10

So it wouldn't even be assault in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you -- so -- so there

11

had to be an instruction that there was an assault in

MS. MILLETT:

There had -- there had to be a

14

deadly weapon to have assault in the second degree, and

15

then -- and I may not get all the nuances of Washington

16

law, but then the jury had to have the sentencing

enhancement, had to make a separate finding that the

18

defendant was armed with a deadly weapon at the time.

19

I'm not sure, again, if it's essentially redundant in

20

21

confusing.

22

It's a little

then dictate the sentence.
And one other point I'd like to make clear is

3

there's been some argument that this case is different

4

from Neder because you have a completed defense.

5

is no different at all.

6

for a non-offense in Neder, and the distinction between

7

a judge making findings that make a verdict that

8

support a non-offense into offense is not one that

9

makes a structural difference.

10

That

You had a completed verdict

And in Carella v. California, Rose v. Clark,

11

you had elements that stood on the fault line between

12

lesser included offenses and greater included offenses.

13

And now, there they weren't missing -- they weren't

14

technically missing elements, but they were elements that

15

were subject to mandatory presumptions by the jury.

16

yet, this Court said that they're subject to harmless

17

error analysis.

18

And

Now, obviously, the type of the element is

19

going to affect the government's ability to prevail

20

under harmless error analysis, and there may well be

21

times when the government will not succeed in that

22

process, especially as you get elements that are more

23

central to, you know, the -- the crime and -- and

24

traditional elements like the intent issues that were

25

at issue in both Carella and in Rose v. Clark.

1

The other point I wanted -- I wanted to make

2

is that the fact that the jury verdict form here came

3

back consistent with -- with the -- or the jury verdict

4

form in Neder came back with the completed crime

5

shouldn't make a difference.

6

jury verdict only came back because of a second

7

mistake.

8

if it found elements A, B, and C, it would -- it would

establish a -- a completed crime.

10

The change in the -- that

The jury was wrongly and mistakenly told that

The fact that in this case you don't have

of courts to analyze this error is the same.

1

The Washington Supreme Court correctly held

2

that as a matter of Federal and State law, the error in

3

this case, as in Blakely cases generally, could not be

4

subjected to harmless error analysis.

5

I think it's important to clarify that as a

6

matter of State law and -- and as recognized by the

7

Washington Supreme Court in its decision in Recuenco,

8

the deadly weapon enhancement and the firearm

9

enhancement are, in fact, lesser and greater offenses

10

of one another.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, do you think in this

18

case you'd be entitled to a lesser included offense

19

instruction as a matter of law?

20

MR. LINK:

I believe that as a matter of

21

Washington law, the answer would be yes.

22

think it turns on the fact that there's this additional

23

factor, additional element, of capacity to fire that

24

differentiates a handgun from a firearm.

MR. LINK:

There was no evidence, I think, to

suggest that it did.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You're not entitled to --

5

you're not entitled to a lesser included offense

6

instruction for which there's no evidence.

7

MR. LINK:

Under Washington law, a defendant

8

gets a lesser included instruction so long as the

9

evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to him,

10

would support the fact that the lesser was -- was

11

included.

12

Now, it can't turn on whether or not the

13

State -- or whether the jury simply disbelieves the

14

State's proof, but it can -- when looking at the -- the

15

evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant,

16

look at holes in the State's evidence, such as the fact

17

that there is no evidence before this jury about this

18

gun's capacity to fire.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but there -- there is

20

evidence from which the jury could find that it was a

21

real gun, and in the absence of any indication to the

22

contrary, that is competent evidence for the jury to

23

use in concluding that it would function like a real

doubt that the handgun was what it purported to be,

there would be no reason to -- there would be no

But in the absence of any reason to

MR. LINK:

As a matter of Washington law and

as of the fact that this is, indeed, an element of a

fire.

authority?

regardless of the manner in which it's used.

2

individual, and in that context would be a deadly

3

weapon regardless of whether it was likely to cause a

4

serious bodily harm.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No -- no question.

But if

there -- but if there is no reason to question its

apparent functionality, I mean, you know, it's a

It looks like a handgun.

Somebody is holding

seems to me, as a matter of fact or based on the

statute to doubt that it would be functional.

12

therefore, it would seem to me that the proof would be

13

competent that it was a functioning handgun in the

14

absence of any question raised.

15

MR. LINK:

And

Again, if we compare the

16

definition of a deadly weapon under Washington law with

17

the definition of a firearm under Washington law, a

18

handgun is by definition a deadly weapon.

handgun is not by definition a firearm.

MR. LINK:

No.

5

he asks -- an individual could ask for an instruction

6

in that case and still maintain that the State hasn't

met the proof of -- of establishing even the lesser.

8

And there's nothing tactically contradictory about

9

doing so.

If -- if one -- if an attorney can convince

10

the court to -- to allow the jury to consider a lesser,

11

and then still challenge that -- the proof of that

12

lesser --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if the firearm

14

were not operable, you would not have been entitled to

a jury instruction on the lesser offense of aiming a

Correct?
MR. LINK:

If the firearm -- if looking at

18

the evidence in the light most favorable to the State,

19

he may not have been entitled under the -- the factual

prong that -- that the Washington courts use on lesser

21

and greater offenses.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let's say a new case comes up

Would that -- could that be harmless error?

MR. LINK:

I think that if the parties

litigate the question of whether or not it was an

assault with -- with a firearm, as opposed to litigate

the offense of assault with a deadly weapon, and then

there's merely an omission from the elements, I think

closer to Neder, but I think that's a different

18

scenario than what we have here.

reason why it's different here is because the jury

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

hypothetical to matter is the one thing happens before

11

the jury goes out, and the other happens after.

12

why does that matter?

13

MR. LINK:

And

I think it matters because in a

14

scenario like this, as opposed to either Neder or -- or

15

the hypothetical, the only offense that has ever been

16

litigated to the parties -- or by the parties to the

17

jury was the lesser offense.

18

that only the lesser offense was at issue, and we know

19

that because in response to Mr. Recuenco's motion to

20

vacate, the State told the judge you aren't required to

21

give the firearm instruction because that's not an

22

element of either the substantive charge or the

23

enhancement.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

So this is not a case, as I think you were suggesting,

in which there has never been a charge of the offense

problem was in the jury verdict, not in the charge, not

in notice to the defendant.

It is.

Isn't the

natural reading of -- or understanding of the word

20

isn't that what people would normally take it to mean?

21

MR. LINK:

That may be, but as a matter of

arguing that you ought to win because if you don't win,

as a matter of Federal constitutional law, we would be

condoning a verdict for an offense that was never

charged.

But if, in fact, handgun is properly read,

properly understood to mean a pistol or a revolver, and

that's what a firearm -- that's -- that's what a

law, then in fact the offense has been charged.

11

to be enough to bring it within Neder regardless of

law, Mr. Recuenco's jury was properly charged and

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, when you say it's not

representation that nobody had an idea that they were

trying this under the theory of a firearm.

4

It seems inconsistent with your

MR. LINK:

I think it's -- it would be

5

equally inconsistent with the State's current position

6

if we look at JA 35 where the prosecutor's response was

we didn't need that instruction because firearm was not

an element of the crime charged.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you think it would have

10

been error in this case based on the evidence presented

11

and the way the -- the case was argued -- would it have

12

been error for the judge to instruct the jury that if

13

they found that there was a firearm involved, they

14

should make a -- they could make a -- a finding on

15

that?

16

MR. LINK:

Well, it's interesting because

17

post Recuenco, after the Washington Supreme Court's

18

ruling in this case, yes, that would be an error

19

because after the Washington Supreme Court's decision

20

in this case, what they said is that --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But as a constitutional

22

matter, would it have been error for the judge to

instruct the jury in this case, based on this evidence,

used as part of the assault?

MR. LINK:

As a matter of constitutional

-- but under Washington law, it was a verdict they

4

couldn't -- as we know from Recuenco now, it's a

5

verdict they couldn't have returned.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But as

Ms. Millett tells us

7

that that only applies on remand under -- under the

8

Hughes case.

9

MR. LINK:

Under Washington law, when a court

10

-- as I think is common under Federal law, whenever a

11

court interprets a statute, determines what it means,

12

that is what the statute has always mean -- means, and

13

-- and that is what that statute will mean in the

14

future until such time as the legislature amends it.

15

As of this date, while the -- the legislature

16

has amended the statutes at issue in Hughes, it has

17

done nothing with respect to this statute.

18

stands now, based on the recognition of the Washington

19

Supreme Court that at the time of the entry of that

20

decision, there was no provision to submit that

21

question to a jury in Mr. Recuenco's case.

22

also no provision to submit it to a jury in another

23

case because prior to Recuenco, the only means by which

24

the firearm enhancement could be obtained was pursuant

25

to the decisions in Meggyesy, Rai, and Olney.

Would that also have been assault in the second degree?

10

actually two elements of assault two.

14

and also an element of the -- but to allege a firearm,

back to our earlier exchange, if we accept the

proposition that charging that he used a handgun was

sufficient to charge a firearm, then the charge against

him was assault in the second degree with the maximum

enhancement for use of a firearm.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Again, had -You -- you and I may

then the charge was assault two with the maximum

enhancement.

12

Isn't that correct?

MR. LINK:

I think if the information and --

13

and the instructions were read in that manner, the

14

State was wrong to concede that there was Blakely error

15

here at all because, if as a matter of law, a handgun

is automatically a firearm, there would have been no

Blakely violation at all.

But that's not the case.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I thought the -- I

19

thought the reason they conceded the Blakely violation

20

was that in the instructions to the jury, the

21

instruction only went to deadly weapon and the

instruction did not specifically refer to firearm.

thought that's why they -- they stipulated that there

application of harmless error simply eviscerates what

Blakely sought to draw as the limits -- or excuse me --

as the -- as the outer boundaries of the jury's right.

And in fact, it -- it's the equivalent of a second

13

the trial court's assessment of the proper charge.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the other way

15

of looking at it is it's based on trying to understand

16

what the jury meant when it said deadly weapon when the

17

only evidence of a deadly weapon they were presented

18

was a firearm.

19

MR. LINK:

It assumes, I think, that -- that

the -- it assumes the correctness of the judge's -- of

simply accept the -- the jury's verdict for what it was

And again, as a matter of -- of Sixth

Amendment jurisprudence, even had the State put

together evidence establishing the capacity of the

weapon, even if it were to contradict Washington law on

that point.

The jury would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in Neder, even if

10

the jury had been asked to rule on materiality, it

11

could have decided not to rule according to the

12

evidence.

13

The same argument applies in Neder.
MR. LINK:

But -- but, again, in Neder, the

14

jury returned a verdict of guilty on the offense that

15

was litigated to it and based on the parties'

understanding of what offense was at issue.

case, that doesn't happen.

18

illustrated by the prosecutor's response to Mr.

19

Recuenco's motion to vacate, and it's illustrated by

20

the court's judgment and sentence, which is at page 14

21

of the joint appendix, where it specifically finds that

22

the only verdict -- and -- and again, doesn't question

23

the verdict -- that the only verdict returned was

24

deadly weapon other than a firearm.

25

that the jury found that it was the firearm verdict.

Washington law, which Recuenco overturned, it concluded

it had to impose the firearm enhancement.

5

It recognizes that

But based on then-existing

So there's no suggestion by either the

6

parties or the trial court or the Washington Supreme

7

Court, for that matter, that there was anything wrong

8

with the jury returning a verdict of deadly weapon

9

because, as a matter of Washington law and as

10

recognized by each of those -- those entities, the jury

11

-- the jury could do that, and they did.

12

Refusing to apply harmless error in this case

13

doesn't require a single retrial of a single

14

individual.

15

itself, in -- in those cases, had harmless error not

16

applied, the defendants would have been entitled to a

new trial.

18

what would happen is -- is defendants would be remanded

MR. LINK:

As it exists now and based on the

Recuenco, those individuals sentenced before the

11

entitled to have their cases remanded back for entry of

12

a conviction based on the jury's verdict.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What I'm saying, you don't

14

concede, do you, that Washington would have the option

15

to retry him to try to obtain the 3-year enhancement.

MR. LINK:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. LINK:

I -- I certainly don't.
I wouldn't think so.

And both as a matter of double

jeopardy and as a matter of Washington law, I don't

20

think that -- that would -- could occur.

21

The Washington Supreme Court correctly held

22

that harmless error analysis could not apply where the

23

trial court has set aside the jury's complete verdict

24

greater, both as a matter of State and Federal law.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. WHISMAN

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Whisman, can I -- can I

8

ask you a hypothetical which I think puts in starker

9

form what the -- what your colleague here says this

10
11

case involves?
Suppose that -- that you have a statute, a

12

murder statute, which applies to the murder of a single

13

individual, but -- but you have another statute with a

14

death penalty called aggravated murder.

15

different crime and it -- it requires the -- the

16

killing of more than one person in -- in the same -- in

17

the same event.

18

And it's a

Let's assume a trial in which somebody came

19

into a bank with a machine gun.

20

in, and five people were killed.

21

only brought a prosecution for simple murder.

22

And the jury comes back with a verdict for -- for

23

simple murder.

Only one person came
But the prosecution
Okay?

24

Certainly a judge would not be able to say,

25

well, no jury could possibly have found simple murder

54
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

here without also thinking that this person was guilty

2

of -- of this greater offense of -- of aggravated

3

murder and, therefore, I'm going to enter a judgment of

4

aggravated murder.

5

That's what the -- the defense says happened

6

here, that there was just a verdict of -- of the lesser

7

offense.

8

found more and maybe -- maybe in finding that, it -- it

9

must have thought that the greater offense also

That's all the jury found.

It could have

10

existed, but it never came in with a verdict for the

11

greater offense.

12
13
14

Now, tell me why what happened here is
different from -- from the hypothetical.
MR. WHISMAN:

I think the key difference is

15

the charging part of your hypothetical.

16

hypothetical assumes this defendant was never put on

17

notice that he was facing aggravated murder, and if

18

that were true, then under your cases and under --

19

under our Washington law, we would analyze that as a

20

failure of notice.

21

of implications for a defendant, including the evidence

22

that they marshal at trial, but also including perhaps

23

his interest in negotiating a plea agreement if a

24

defendant doesn't know that he's facing aggravated

25

murder at the end.

Your

The -- and it could have any number

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose under Justice

2

Scalia's hypothetical, aggravated murder is -- is in

3

the charging documents, but the judge doesn't say

4

aggravated murder when he submits it to the jury.

5

MR. WHISMAN:

Then I think that is

6

susceptible to harmless error analysis, Your Honor.

7

And it would be -- there would be an open question as

8

to whether or not, of course, it is harmless, but then

9

I think that we're back to the Neder situation.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But then we'd have Justice

11

Scalia's case if this information left out the words,

12

to wit, a handgun.

13

MR. WHISMAN:

You would be closer to Justice

14

Scalia's case, Justice Stevens, yes.

15

Washington law, we analyze the charging document and

16

the sufficiency of it and ask whether or not it was --

17

the words used sufficiently appraised the defendant.

18

But I think the defendant would have a stronger

19

argument for the fact that he didn't know what he was

20

facing if you had that hypothetical.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Although under

2

MR. WHISMAN:

They can be a component of the

3

harmless error analysis.

4

would handle that as a charging document challenge.

5

other words, the defendant would say I was never

6

charged with this crime and therefore I didn't marshal

7

my evidence, et cetera.

8
9

Ordinarily in Washington, we
In

It's a due process violation.

Either way, I don't think that the -- the conviction
stands much chance of surviving.

10

I did want to answer, first, a question that

11

had been raised by pointing the Court to JA 18 where

12

the defendant says, my proposed instruction makes clear

13

that the deadly weapon in question is the firearm, that

14

-- not that some other kind of weapon might have been

15

deadly.

16

appropriately.

17

So I think that focuses the issue

I also wanted to point out that Justice

18

Alito's hypothetical is really the State v. Williams

19

case that we cited at page 14 in our reply brief where

20

the defendant was expressly charged firearm and the

21

victim was shot during the course of the crime.

22

the issue didn't go -- the -- the same verdict form as

23

we have here -- in other words, it said only deadly

24

weapon -- was given to the jury, and the Washington

25

court of appeals, feeling itself bound by Recuenco,

And

57
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

reversed that finding.

2

So I think that the opinion of the Washington

3

Supreme Court is unduly broad and should be overturned.
