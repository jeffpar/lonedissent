ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

IN NOS. 04-1528 AND 04-1530

10

12

MR. BOPP:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
As this Court made clear recently in

13

Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, since political

14

candidates are the ones who take office, it is

15

imperative that they be allowed freely to express

16

themselves on matters of current public importance.

17

a result, this Court has never allowed the government

18

to prohibit candidates from communicating relevant

19

information to voters during an election.

20

As

Vermont, however, has adopted low expenditure

21

and contribution limits for the opposite purpose,

22

reducing overall candidate campaign spending, and these

23

limits would have that effect.

24

incompatible with any reasonable interpretation of the

25

First Amendment and is not justified by any truly

This is fundamentally

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

compelling governmental interest.

2

are unconstitutional.

3

As a result, they

Now, Vermont's expenditure limits are an

4

unprecedented, direct restraint on candidate speech.

5

Once these low expenditure limits are exhausted, a

6

candidate may not drive to the village green to address

7

a rally, may not return the phone call from a reporter

8

at the local newspaper, and may not call a neighbor to

9

urge her to get out to vote.

This Court has never

10

allowed the government to prohibit candidates from

11

communicating this sort of relevant information during

12

a campaign.

13

Further, this Court has long held that more

14

speech is better than less speech.

15

contribution limits are available to address any

16

realistic concerns about corruption, the public will

17

benefit from candidates' being allowed to spend all

18

that they can lawfully raise in their campaign.

19

As long as

Now, the record is clear in this case that

20

the expenditure limits will deprive candidates of

21

substantial resources.

22

looked at average spending over the last three

23

elections and found that in all but one category, that

24

is, Senate candidates running in single-member

25

districts, that the average spending for all candidates

The district court erroneously

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in those campaigns were below the limits set by the

2

expenditure limits in Vermont.

3

However, in Buckley, the last case for --

4

where this Court considered candidate expenditure

5

limits, the Court looked at the number of races

6

affected, not the average spending in all races.

7

in Buckley, the Court looked at the expenditures in

8

U.S. Senate races and found that in previous election,

9

that 26 percent were over the mandatory expenditure

And

10

limits considered in Buckley, and in the House, 3

11

percent of the races had spending greater than the --

12

these limits.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

clarify a procedural point?

15

expenditure issue, there is no final decision that has

16

gone back to the district court for further

17

proceedings.

18
19
20

MR. BOPP:

Mr. Bopp, would you
As I understand it, on the

Well, there were -- that is

correct, that there is a remand.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it may -- the district

21

court might -- may well find that nothing passes

22

constitutional muster in the end.

23
24
25

MR. BOPP:

Well, they could potentially, yes.

However, the -- the Second Circuit did -- did make
decisions of law.

They found that these two interests

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that the State is alleging, that is, in preventing

2

corruption and in conserving incumbent time, were

3

together a compelling governmental interest, and we --

4

we allege that they are not and that on this record,

5

this Court can determine that they are not -- they are

6

not together a compelling governmental interest.

7
8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you arguing now then

that there may be no limits on expenditures?

9

MR. BOPP:

Well, the -- this Court has now

10

considered, including this case, a dozen times in which

11

the government has sought to limit expenditures, either

12

of candidates or PAC's or political parties, and

13

despite the work of the most brilliant lawyers in the

14

United States, they have not come up with any

15

compelling governmental interest that this Court has

16

accepted.

17

that these claimed interests either are not compelling

18

or are not proven.

And we believe that this record demonstrates

19

Now --

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do you -- when -- when you

21

make that point, that on this record the -- the claimed

22

interests are not compelling or not proven, would you

23

have us leave the door open for a greater degree of

24

proof?

25

candidate time.

For example, take the -- the problem of
The lower the donation limits are, the

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- the more donations there have got to be, and -- and

2

there's -- there's plenty of comment, particularly in

3

some of the amicus briefs, on the amount of time that

4

political candidates generally spend scrounging around

5

for money.

6

door be left open for a more impressive and compelling

7

record on this issue?

8
9
10

MR. BOPP:

13

Well, we -- we are asserting that

that is not a compelling interest in and of itself, and
this Court should reject it.

11
12

If we decided the case your way, would the

I -- I just don't see --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you also say, on this

MR. BOPP:

And in addition -- well, the

record.
Yes.

14

-- the point about it not being a compelling interest I

15

think is an analytical point that doesn't have to be --

16

that doesn't rest on this -- strictly on this record.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So I -- I take it your point

18

then on the combined corruption/competition for money

19

problem is that there isn't any record that would

20

support it.

21
22
23

MR. BOPP:

If it were a compelling interest,

there's no record here that is a problem in Vermont.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right, but you're saying

24

this combination cannot be a compelling interest as a

25

matter of law, consistent with the First Amendment.

Is

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that correct?

2

MR. BOPP:

Yes, it is.

I don't see how it is

3

a compelling governmental interest to limit challengers

4

to only fund-raise to the extent that an incumbent

5

finds comfortable or convenient.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Yes.
Well, just -Or at least where -- where

the limitation -- you make a big point of this in your

10

brief as -- as I -- as I recall.

11

reason the candidate would have to spend so much time

12

is the very small contribution limit established by the

13

same statute.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is a contribution

Well, to get back to

22

Justice Souter's questions, could you answer it this

23

way?

And -- and I don't think maybe we can take judicial of

Let's assume that some members of the Court

that, but I -- I think that's a common sense conclusion

2

that we can reach.

3

brief to say that this doesn't happen.

4

that.

5

if -- if we or I were to conclude that, what would

6

follow?

7

And you tend to fight this in your

I tend to think money does buy access.

MR. BOPP:
just access.

access that this Court found in the --

11

It has to be a matter of privileged

All right.

Let's say it's

privileged access.

MR. BOPP:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

that the -- that this is up to the voters.

can see what's going on and throw the legislator out if

17

they choose.

MR. BOPP:

Washington, DC 20005

1

not the blunderbuss approach here.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It -- it is true that all

3

the polls say that there's public disaffection and

4

cynicism.

5

incumbents who take particularly large sums of money?

6

Is there -- is there statistical evidence to show that?

7

Does that translate into action to defeat

MR. BOPP:

I'm not aware of that.

But

8

certainly the press and opponents often, you know,

9

point to examples where they believe that their

10

challenger is under too much of an influence of a

11

particular entity, and the voters, you know, in certain

12

circumstances take that into account in their voting.

13

And furthermore, it is true that there is a

14

general cynicism about politicians and government that

15

has existed since the first colonists came to our

16

country and continues today.

17

system is established on the proposition that we need

18

to limit the -- the government, and we need to have

19

checks and balances because we don't want free rein by

20

politicians because we are concerned about their

21

exercise of power.

In fact, our governmental

But if this is enough --

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May ask you this question,

24

Mr. Bopp?

25

Ginsburg's inquiry, is it your view that there is no

This -- in -- following up on Justice

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

set of facts, no matter how scandalous and so forth and

2

so on, Watergate and all the rest of it, could ever

3

justify an expenditure limit?

4

MR. BOPP:

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That is not our position.
Well, if that's the case,

6

then why -- why would it be inappropriate to have

7

further hearings in this case to see whether they're --

8

they could be justified?

9

MR. BOPP:

Because there have been legal

10

findings by the Second Circuit that we believe are

11

erroneous.

12

previously, is that -- that we do not believe that the

13

-- preserving incumbents' time through expenditure

14

limits can ever be a compelling governmental interest,

15

to limit what challengers can spend -- raise and spend

16

in their own election.

17

expenditure limits don't apply just to incumbents who

18

-- if there is a concern about --

19

The -- the first, as I mentioned

I mean, this interest -- the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, I understand.

I'm just

20

curious to know what sort of -- what sort of evidence

21

could ever support an -- an expenditure limit in your

22

view, if -- if any.

23

MR. BOPP:

24

justifying expenditure limits.

25

I have a -- a very difficult time

I know there's a debate on this Court on

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

whether or not there are per se situations under the

5

about speech that is at the core of the First

6

Amendment, and secondly, we are talking about candidate

8

They are the ones that are going to be exercising

9

governmental power.

If there was ever a candidate for a

In other words, we are talking

Candidates are the ones that go into office.

These low expenditure and

10

contribution limits would have the effect of making

11

candidates a bit player in their own election so that

12

the voters --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, with respect

14

to the contribution limits, what -- what makes this

15

case different from the -- the Shrink PAC case from a

16

few years ago?

17

MR. BOPP:

Well, several things.

First is

18

there was actually a paucity of evidence in the Shrink

19

PAC case.

20

wanted to give one contribution to one candidate, and

21

this Court said that, you know, you didn't need a lot

22

of evidence to combat such a weak -- weak claim.

23

There was only an allegation of one PAC that

So secondly is the novelty and plausibility

24

of a -- adjusted for per election in 1974 dollars of a

25

$50 contribution limit, that that would actually give

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

rise to realistic concern about actual and perceived

2

corruption.

3
4

So, again, in Shrink PAC --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think it --

you think it's the dollar amounts that are involved?

5

MR. BOPP:

Well, one of the decisions that

6

the Court has to make under your jurisprudence is that

7

-- that contribution limits can only eliminate large

8

contributions that give rise to this realistic

9

perception or actuality of corruption.

So it is --

10

whether it's large or not and giving rise to that

11

concern because of the size, that is an integral part

12

of the Shrink analysis.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It -- it was pointed out in

14

-- in one of the briefs -- and I -- I didn't go back

15

and check it myself, but I'd like your comment.

16

pointed out in one of the briefs that the limits in

17

Vermont were substantially close to or even -- even

18

higher than the -- than the limits in the Missouri

19

scheme, out of which the Shrink litigation grew.

20

you know whether that is correct?

21
22

MR. BOPP:
compute it.

23
24
25

It was

Do

Well, it depends on how you -- you

The --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It always -- it always does,

yes.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

The -- well, certainly what the --

2

what the evidence was in Shrink was it was a $1,075

3

limit, again adjusted for inflation, was about $375

4

adjusted for inflation compared to the Buckley limits,

5

and because of the paucity of evidence and the fact

6

that it wasn't really novel to say that a $1,000 limit

7

could give rise to corruption because --

8
9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

limits, Mr. Bopp, and I think that's what Justice
Souter was asking about.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

Yes.
There were the thousand

dollars, but I think it went down as low as $250 in --

14
15

But there were lower

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, take the whole schedule

in Missouri.

16

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

Well, the -- the

17

contribution limits that this Court considered was the

18

$1,075 --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There -- there was a court

20

that subsequently considered the rest and upheld the

21

contribution --

22

MR. BOPP:

Yes, there was.

The Eighth

23

Circuit did so and the -- the lowest limit there was

24

$275 per election, which would be $500 for -- for the

25

-- the entire election cycle.

And the -- and -- but

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

really that -- that was on a -- a record that this

2

Court found to be, frankly, inadequate to -- to raise

3

any serious questions about the -- whether the amounts

4

concerned gave rise to a realistic threat of

5

corruption.

6

And the record here demonstrates that -- that

7

the -- that the only time really there is a actuality

8

or perception of corruption in Vermont is when they --

9

is when we're talking about amounts in excess of

10

$1,000.

11

That was the prior limit.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we -- we didn't send it

back so that more of a record could be made, did we?

There have been criminal convictions.
MR. BOPP:

Well, the -- if it's isolated

3

examples that are unconnected to any perception of

4

corruption at that level, then it would not be adequate

5

on -- on its -- on its -- by itself.

6

Now, of course, in Shrink, the Court cited to

7

both actual and perceived evidence of corruption at the

8

level that the -- you were considering that limit.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -- well, if -- if you

10

-- if you concede and -- and you tend, at least, to

11

back away from the proposition that the case I put

12

would be an inadequate ground or an adequate ground for

13

legislative limits, then I suppose you can say the

14

State has the power to prevent this from happening to

15

begin with.

16

MR. BOPP:

Well, this Court has never

17

approved restrictions on fundamental First Amendment

18

values based purely upon speculation or concern about

19

something that's happening some other place.

words, these are real limits on people in Vermont, and

21

it seems to me that to approve the lowest contribution

22

limits in the Nation and these very low expenditure

limits, the State would have to demonstrate that

24

Vermont is the most corrupt State in the Nation.

25

they're far from it.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Only -- only the most

corruptible.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. BOPP:

Nor corruptible.

The -- the

5

evidence is quite clear.

6

they cite to like the tobacco industry passing out $40

7

checks after a -- a vote defeating a bill.

Of course,

8

that's still legal under this -- this act.

But, you

9

know, even pointing out that they -- that the person

Even in the few examples that

10

who talked about that example made it clear that he

11

didn't believe anybody was -- was influenced by post-

12

contributions after a vote regarding a matter that's

13

not even prohibited by this -- by this act.

14

So it was -- it was a lot of testimony about

15

how truly clean Vermont is, not the most corrupt, where

16

people -- politicians would be tempted at these quite

17

low limits to, you know, sell their honor and -- and

18

personal, you know -- and their -- and affect their

19

own, you know, personal character and reputation.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Bopp, toward the end of

21

your brief, you -- you make the argument that if we

22

accepted the State's position in this case, we

23

implicitly would have accepted the position that

24

totally -- totally publicly funded elections would be

25

constitutional.

And -- and I -- I realize your -- your

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

concern there was with expenditure limits, obviously,

2

not contribution limits.

3

it, but I -- I assume your position is that that would

4

be unconstitutional per se.

5

scheme would be unconstitutional per se.

6
7

MR. BOPP:

You didn't come out and say

The key would be if it's mandated,

voluntary --

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MR. BOPP:

10

A totally publicly funded

Yes.

If it was mandated, yes, it would

be unconstitutional.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And -- and its

12

unconstitutionality would rest on the limitation on

13

expenditure, in effect?

14
15

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

Oh, yes.

Well, there would

be a prohibition in that case if I understand your --

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

MR. BOPP:

Oh, yes, yes.

-- on -- on contributions, and

18

there would be also a -- a mandatory expenditure limit

19

because you could only spend what the government gave

20

you.

21

So that would have all those features.
Now, if it was, of course, voluntary, it

22

would solve the -- the two problems that -- that the

23

State talks about because if you have a voluntary

24

public funding system -- and this is, again, why remand

25

is -- is inappropriate.

You don't need to go back and

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- and determine whether or not the legislature

2

considered providing adequate public funds.

3

it's whether that alternative exists.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I mean,

But on -- on your view, if

5

-- if there were a -- a mandatory publicly funded

6

scheme and the -- the limits on expenditure were very

7

high -- it was a very generous scheme.

8

lots of money -- it would still be unconstitutional

9

because there would be -- I -- I take it on your view,

They gave them

10

because there would be an elimination of any way to

11

participate by contributing.

12

MR. BOPP:

Is that correct?

There would be an absolute

13

prohibition, and this Court in -- in Beaumont reserved

14

that question of whether or not an absolute prohibition

15

-- and -- and then in McConnell, you struck down the

16

absolute prohibition on minors' contributing to

17

campaigns.

18

prohibition on any way for any individual to associate

19

with a campaign through a contribution.

20

So, yes, there would be a absolute

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it would also prevent

21

the candidate himself from expending his entire

22

fortune, if he wishes, in informing people of why he

23

should be elected --

24

MR. BOPP:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, that is true.

MR. BOPP:

And -- and in the record below,

2

plaintiff Donald Brunelle said that he was prepared to

spend considerable sums in support of his State Senate

election, which -- and considerable sums above the

5

expenditure limits that were before -- that were

So the -- the question is an

MR. BOPP:

Well, nor -- nor on fund raising

12

do is write a check.

13

Vermont, they even have an exception for not only just

14

family.

And -- and, of course, in

So, you know -JUSTICE SCALIA:

they have an exception for the wealthy family.
MR. BOPP:

Yes.

To a third degree of

19

consanguinity, people who are related to you to that

20

degree are not subject to the contribution limit.

21

you know, it's hard to justify Vermont's scheme if

22

you're concerned about the influence of the wealthy

23

because they're giving the wealthy carte blanche to

24

fund their own campaigns, even under these limits.

Now, in addition, the expenditure and

Mr. Bopp, may I ask you?

19

You keep -- the way you're discussing this case, one

20

would think that the trial court found there was an

21

evidentiary insufficiency, but I thought, at least on

22

the contributions part, the trial court found that the

23

evidence sufficed to justify those limits.

24
25

MR. BOPP:

They did, but erroneously, and I

Vermont were, quote, suspiciously large, and then they

cited six different witnesses.

simply not true that any of them said that it was

relationship between contributions between the old

22

limits of $1,000 per election and these new, much --

This Court

If a contribution limit acts as

an expenditure limit, then it can -- it will be also be

struck down if the candidates cannot mount effective

campaigns.

13

And here we have demonstrated in the record

14

what an effective campaign amounts to, and the amounts

15

even for the House district of $2,000 would be simply

16

used up by 1 brochure, 100 yard signs, and 1 postcard

mailing.

18

and that would amount to $1,500 to $2,000, almost the

19

entire amount allowed, not allowing even one mailing to

all voters in -- in that House district.

All of these have been valued in the record,

MR. SORRELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, thank you,

Justice Kennedy, you raised the issue of

whether money buys access.

It clearly does.

Counsel --

the record convincingly shows that the ties among donor

groups and elected officials often determine the

positions officials take.

17

of an official who took a position because of the ties

MR. SORRELL:

Can you give me an example

The -- there was testimony that

20

his legislative duties because of that whole lot of

2

money that he had collected in the year before.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

that that official's official positions were determined

State, and I think 73 percent believe that the average

10

citizen --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Would you describe

12

your State as a clean State politically or as a corrupt

13

one?

14

MR. SORRELL:

We have a real problem in

15

Vermont.

16

haven't had legislators tearfully apologizing for

17

having taken bribes, facing an indictment the next day.

18

We haven't had a Governor go to prison.

In over 65

The reality is that these contribution limits

that we had -- we had examples under the old

contribution limits.

4

that in Vermont, a $1,000 contribution -- if you

receive a $1,000 contribution in Vermont -- this is one

of the petitioners -- then Vermonters think that you've

If we translated those into 1974 dollars, they're just

the numbers Justice Scalia mentioned, and I would like

to know why are they -- why does not give incumbents a

tremendous advantage, that if you have the incumbent

plus a newspaper, it's hopeless, that there's no way of

spending as a challenger.

these limits far too low?

MR. SORRELL:

In other words, why aren't

Incumbents had a much more of

an advantage in the pre-Act 64 world.

They could raise

more money and spend more money than --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not going to help to

12

say incumbents had a bigger advantage before.

13

the question is, what we're interested in is -- at

14

least what I've written that I'm interested in, is at

15

what point do these become so low that they really, as

16

a significant matter, shut off the possibility of a

17

challenge.

18

which do not tell me the expenditures in a competitive

19

district, and your numbers, which do not explain all

20

the problems that Judge Winter had with these things,

21

do not help.

And from that point of view, your numbers,

That's why I'm asking you the question.

22

MR. SORRELL:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. SORRELL:

25

That is,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it shows that in the largest urban area in the State,

2

in the Burlington area, you can buy three 30-second TV

3

ads in prime time on tier one cable for $45.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not talking about the

5

expenditure.

6

limits.

7

We don't know who the candidates for State rep are, but

8

we want a Republican slate or we want a Democratic

9

slate.

I'm talking about the contribution

I and my friends have the following thought.

So we get all our $5 together, give them to the

10

Democratic Party or the Republican Party in Vermont,

11

and lo and behold, that party cannot give more than

12

$100 in an election to a State rep, et cetera.

13

Now, to the -- to the ear, that sounds as if

14

a challenger or a slate of challengers or a party that

15

wants to challenge is going to have a really tough

16

time.

17

So I want you to explain it.
MR. SORRELL:

The extensive record below

18

shows that with these contribution limits, attacking

19

the corruption and the appearance of corruption issue,

20

the candidates can amass the resources necessary to run

21

effective campaigns at all levels.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It shows that on average.

23

It doesn't show that in the competitive races, which is

24

where the -- where the shoe pinches.

25

MR. SORRELL:

The -- the reality is that --

32
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that in virtually all classes of races, other than the

2

single-member Senate races, that average spending was

3

below these expenditure limits, and these include

4

contested cases with primaries, without.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's just what I said.

6

Your figures show that the average spending is below,

7

but that's not what's significant.

8

is what Justice Breyer posed, where -- where there is a

9

unseat somebody who's been in there for years.

-- that's where the shoe pinches.

12

MR. SORRELL:

That's

And, Justice Scalia, under our

13

law, the challenger can spend more than the incumbent

because the incumbent has a lid not -- of 85 percent or

My understanding was that a quarter-page ad

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to return to a question that Justice

12

Kennedy asked earlier about why, if there are examples

13

of corruption that the public becomes aware of, why the

14

public doesn't respond simply by voting the individual

15

out of office.

16

that some of the most serious examples of corruption on

17

this record or of the undue influence achieved by

18

monetary concerns were not examples that ever became

19

public except in the course of the trial of this case

20

when we had witnesses come forward to testify about

21

some of their own personal experiences in the

22

legislature.

23

candidates becoming unduly beholden to the interests

24

that can provide the greatest sums for their campaigns,

25

those kinds of incidents are not going to typically be

And I think it's important to point out

Washington, DC 20005

1

a matter of discussion --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but I -- I thought that

3

the point was that the public mistrusts their

4

representatives because of large donations, and I

5

thought the point being made was, well, if that's the

6

case and the public sees that this fellow has gotten a

7

$10,000 donation, the public will say this -- this

8

fellow is in that -- is in that corporation's or that

person's pocket.

the mouth of the candidate, that -- that he voted for

14

the bill because he got $10,000.

15

it's on the public record that he got $10,000, if -- if

16

what you say is correct, that -- that people are

17

worried about, the -- the corruptive effect of such

18

donations, people should logically vote against that

19

candidate who accepts so much money.

20
21

You -- you don't have to show that -- out of

MS. WRIGHT:

The mere fact that

Two points on that, Your Honor.

First of all, the problem of holding candidates

22

accountable in that manner is greatly exacerbated when

23

you have a system of unlimited spending in which all of

24

the candidates involved feel compelled to go out and

25

raise as much as they can in order to forestall the

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

possibility of being outspent.

2

well, why are you doing this, the candidate has a

ready-made answer.

4

maybe I'd rather not, but if I don't, I'm going to be

5

bested in the fund-raising arms race.

reluctantly have come to --

Then when a voter says,

But I thought --

-- understand that that's --- when you look at

10

the -- the record, Vermont would be the last place that

11

you'd be worried about it.

12

we just heard, is that it's easy to go door to door,

13

and that's what the Vermonters expect.

14

take an arms race to get on your feet and go door to

15

door.

16

on the respondents' side of the case between justifying

17

low limits by saying you don't really need money to run

18

effectively and at the same time suggesting that

19

there's a serious problem with too much money.

The political culture, as

And it doesn't

And it seems to me that there's a real dilemma

MS. WRIGHT:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MS. WRIGHT:

Well, but -Which is it?

-- what we do have is candidates

23

-- even though it is possible to run effective

24

campaigns in Vermont for lower amounts, candidates

25

nevertheless go out and raise often much more than what

46

1

they need.

Senate candidate Vincent Illuzzi.

3

$39,000, almost $40,000, for his Senate campaign.

4

challenger was able to raise almost nothing.

5

spent $30,000 worth of that.

6

$39,000 or $30,000 to run an effective Senate campaign,

but an incumbent that builds a war chest has the

ability to deter serious challenges.

campaigns.

2

MS. WRIGHT:

Yes, Your Honor, because this

3

Burlington mayor's race, as an example, was one in

4

which there was no limit on -- on spending, and both

5

candidates were able to raise amounts either similar to

6

what they had raised in the past or at least amounts

7

that met the campaign budget that they had sought to --

8

to follow.

9

I think in looking at the level of the

10

contribution limits, it's important again to understand

11

the scale of politics in Vermont.

12

compare them to Missouri, a $2,000 limit for a

13

gubernatorial race in Missouri was approved by this

14

Court, and in Missouri you had an election in 2000

15

where each candidate was spending $8 million or $9

million in a gubernatorial race.

No, but the --

JUSTICE BREYER:

I have a different question

11

I'd like to ask you which I haven't heard addressed

12

yet.

13

Buckley v. Valeo, and the Court held in that case that

14

expenditure limits are not constitutional.

15

whether I agree with that or don't agree with that, am

16

I not bound by that?

17

On the expenditure limits, there is a case,

Now,

And insofar as you try to distinguish it,

18

you've read what Judge Winter said about your efforts

19

to distinguish it.

20

you think I'm not bound by a past precedent in an

21

important matter, with which I may or may not have

22

agreed at the time.

23

And therefore, I'd like to hear why

MS. WRIGHT:

Yes, Your Honor.

We believe

24

expenditure limits can be upheld without overruling

25

Buckley v. Valeo, and that's for several reasons.

49
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

First, Buckley created a rule of exacting

2

scrutiny that applies to expenditure limits.

3

not a rule of automatic invalidation.

4

That is

And very importantly, when Buckley declared

5

that the interest in deterring corruption and its

6

appearance was not adequate to support the expenditure

7

limits, that was on a record in which neither spending

8

nor contributions had been subject to meaningful limits

9

prior to the time of FECA and the amendments that the

10

Court was considering.

11

show the Court of how contribution limits alone would

12

really work to address the problem of corruption and

13

the appearance of -- of corruption and encouraging

14

public confidence in government.

15

There simply was no record to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now --

I thought -- I thought what

16

that case said and what many of our other cases say,

17

with regard to expenditures in particular, is that

18

you're not talking about money here.

19

about speech.

20

campaigning, you're talking about speech.

21

You're talking

So long as all that money is going to

And when you say you don't need any more

22

speech than this, that's a very odd thing for -- for a

23

-- a United States Government to say.

24

You don't need any more than this.

25

reason the expenditure limits, as opposed to

Enough speech.

And that's the

50
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

contribution limits, were regarded quite differently in

2

Buckley and I think should still be regarded

3

differently today.

4

not money you're constraining.

5

you're constraining money, but when you say you can't

6

expend more than this on your campaign, you're saying,

7

no, no, no, this is enough speech.

8

we, the State, are going to tell you how much you

9

should campaign.

10
11

You're constraining speech.

It's

Contribution limits,

We're going to --

That's very unusual in -- in American

democracy.
MS. WRIGHT:

Your Honor, I think that's

12

certainly why Buckley applied exacting scrutiny.

13

think what Vermont understood is that political

14

spending has inescapably a dual character.

15

campaign spending enables many forms of speech, but it

16

also has another side because higher and higher levels

17

of campaign spending result in candidates who are

18

beholden to the constituencies that can provide the

19

greatest amounts of funds for their campaigns.

20

MS. WRIGHT:

Because the -- the interests

10

that Vermont is seeking to serve are fundamental to the

11

core functions of government, preserving the quality of

12

representative government, preserving the integrity of

13

government, assuring the public that its officeholders

14

can act in the best interests of the public and make

15

decisions on the merits, not simply based on their need

16

for campaign cash.

17

And this question of accountability that's so

18

important is tied to the ability to say, I've -- I've

19

met my spending limits, I've raised all that I need to

We believe that under almost any system,

8

incumbents are going to still have advantages and no

campaign finance system can fully address that.

But we

10

believe that if the challenger now has the ability to

11

outspend the incumbent and the incumbent doesn't have

12

that additional advantage of being able to outspend the

13

challenger, as is most often the case, then competition

14

can only be enhanced.

So as

Now, secondly, as to the effect on

8

challengers, the record demonstrates that challengers

9

-- and there's expert testimony to the fact that

10

challengers are more frequently challenged in primaries

11

than are incumbents, and the Randall brief on pages 16

12

and 17 point out the testimony of people who have been

13

subject to a primary and demonstrates that they are not

14

able to mount an effective campaign in the general.

15

Furthermore, the expenditure limits have the

16

perverse result of depriving challengers of more money

17

than incumbents, probably making them attractive to

18

incumbents.

19

would be deprived of 20 percent of their total

20

resources, while challengers would be deprived of 36

percent of their total resources.

MR. BOPP:

perception is the opposite, but the general perception

3

is not true in Vermont.

-- the fact that the way this law is constructed

5

strongly suggests that is -- it is seeking to favor

6

incumbents.

7

I -- I know that -- that the general

And -- and that points to the

Furthermore, we had expert witness testimony

8

on the effect of contribution limits on competitive

9

races.

The -- we had -- Mr. McNeil testified in

10

examining the competitive races in the 1998 election

11

that the vast majority in both the House and the Senate

12

would not be able to mount an effective campaign with

13

the available resources that would have been available

14

after imposing the contribution limits.

15

course, these were in the amounts of 28 percent in the

16

Senate, 22 percent in the House, which is way beyond

17

the 5.1 percent that this Court in Buckley thought that

18

could be made up by the imposition of a $1,000 limit.

19

And, of

I mean, this -- this law is so constructed

20

that it would make it virtually impossible for, for

21

instance, countywide candidates in Chittenden County, a

22

county of 150,000, the largest county in Vermont --

23

they would be limited to $4,000 for the primary and the

general election.

presumption, actually the -- the statute answers the

question of whether or not this presumption disappears.

If you look at 2809, subsection (e), the last sentence

says, the findings and determination of the court --

9

and this is in this court proceeding by your opponent

10

that is trying to claim that this spending over here is

actually yours -- that the findings and the

determination of the court shall be prima facie

13

evidence in any proceeding brought for violation of the

chapter.

presumption never goes away.

16

-- each candidate and each independent spender can look

at the rebuttable presumption requirement and say, I

have to file a report and that governs my report.
