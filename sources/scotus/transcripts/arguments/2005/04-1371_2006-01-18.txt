ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY B. KASNER

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KASNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In an effort to limit State-law securities

12

class-actions which undermine the market for nationally

13

traded securities, Congress enacted SLUSA, a statute of

14

broad preemption.

15

of Petitioner's blue brief, preempts, subject to three

16

specific statutory extensions, all State-law-covered class

17

actions, quote, "by any private party who alleges

18

misrepresentations, omissions, or fraudulent behavior in

19

connection with the purchase or sale of a covered

20

security."

21

exception, that nowhere appears in the statutory language,

22

and is wholly at odds with the purpose in the enactment of

23

the statute for holders claims, a type of claim in which a

24

plaintiff alleges, "I did not purchase" or "I did not

25

sell, but would have, had I known the allegedly false

SLUSA, which is reprinted at page 8(a)

The Second Circuit erred in implying an

information," a type of claim which this Court, in Blue

2

Chip Stamps, over 30 years ago, recognized as the most

3

vexatious and abusive type of securities class-action

4

claims.

5

The court below erred, for a number of different

6

reasons.

7

natural meaning of the statute.

8

examination of SLUSA, beginning at page 8(a), reflects

9

that no covered class action may be maintained, quote, "by

First and foremost, it completely violated the
As I have mentioned, an

10

any private party," a clause that this Court, time and

11

again, has interpreted as perhaps the broadest way of

12

phrasing "any and all private parties" making certain

13

types of allegations.

14

(b), focusing on the conduct of the defendant in

15

connection with the purchase or sale of a covered

16

security.

17

Those allegations appear in (a) or

Now, Congress could have -- had it intended to

18

inject a purchaser/seller limitation, consistent with what

19

the court below concluded, Congress could have phrased

20

that language differently.

21

both the 1933 and 1934 acts, Congress has made express

22

causes of action, subject to an explicit purchase or

23

seller requirement.

24

act affords a private right of action to purchasers of

25

securities in registered offerings.

As the Court is aware, in the

For example, section 11 of the '33

Section 12 affords a

Washington, DC 20005

1

private right of action to persons from whom an offer or

2

sale of securities.

3

similarly, affords a purchase or seller requirement.

4

Section 9(e) of the '34 act,

Significantly, SLUSA nowhere speaks in terms of

5

a purchase or sale.

6

Congress could have provided that no covered class action

7

by any private party alleging "his or her sale" of a

8

covered security is preempted.

9

private party alleging a misrepresentation or omission of

And it could have.

For example,

It could have said, "Any

10

a material fact in connection with the plaintiff or that

11

party's purchase or sale."

12

It did not.

The decision of the court below is also at odds

13

with this Court's teaching in United States versus

14

O'Hagan, which was decided 1 year before SLUSA was enacted

15

by Congress.

16

concluded that the so-called "misappropriation theory"

17

stated a viable claim in a criminal case brought by the

18

United States Government.

19

the defendant that no one involved that had been defrauded

purchased or -

21

In United States versus O'Hagan, this Court

In responding to an argument by

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just ask you this

22

question about the plain language?

23

1(f)(1)(A) had not been "in connection with the purchase

24

of sale -- sale of security," had been "in connection with

25

his or her purchase or sale," then it would have been

If the word in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

covered, would it not?

2

MR. KASNER:

Justice Stevens, if, by "his or

3

her," it's referencing "any private party," I would agree

4

with that.

5

That would be a different case in -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So, the question is whether we

6

should construe the word "the" to be the functional

7

equivalent of "his or her."

8

MR. KASNER:

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

MR. KASNER:

In essence, Justice Stevens Is that true?

-- that's correct.

And I think

11

that that question has been answered by this Court, on a

12

number of different occasions.

13

versus O'Hagan, this Court concluded that the "in

14

connection with the purchase or sale of a security" does

15

not mean "in connection with the purchase or sale by

16

another party to the securities transaction," but, rather,

17

means "in connection with the purchase or sale by anyone."

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Again, in United States

Mr. Kasner, the -- does the

19

Securities and Exchange Commission have enforcement

20

authority in this -- in this area?

21

MR. KASNER:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

Have they issued any rules or

regulations on this -- on this point?

24
25

It does, Justice Scalia.

MR. KASNER:

The point being, Your Honor,

whether -

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

On the point that you're

2

arguing, whether the critical language means the person's

3

own sale, or not -

4

MR. KASNER:

Yes, Your Honor.

In adjudicatory

5

proceedings referenced in our brief, the SEC has

6

unanimously, and uniformly, taken the position that it

7

does not.

8

prosecutions, in civil prosecutions, the Government has

9

consistently taken the position, as it has in this case,

10
11
12
13

In briefs to this Court in criminal

as an amicus, and as it did in the court below.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it your position that we owe

deference to the interpretation of the SEC?
MR. KASNER:

That is our position, Your Honor.

14

We do take the position that this Court should defer to

15

the views of the SEC on that issue.

16

is, should it be Chevron or Skidmore, is not a question

17

Your Honor has asked.

18

vis-a-vis 10(b)(5) -

19
20

What that deference

I'm happy to say that we believe,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if it's just Skidmore,

forget about it.

21

[Laughter.]

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. KASNER:

I mean, that's -

Well, Your Honor, I actually

24

carefully studied yesterday's opinion, where this Court

25

discussed the Skidmore deference, and, either way, we

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

think that this is -- the statute is so clear that,

2

deference or none, there really is no other way to read

3

the language of the statute.

4

As I say, this Court, in United States versus

5

O'Hagan, concluded squarely that this language does not

6

mean the purchase or sale of the plaintiff's securities.

7

Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion, joined in by

8

Justice Stevens, in the Holmes case makes that same point.

9

Significantly, Your Honors, the "in connection with"

10

language, as a statutory matter, has consistently been

11

construed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and

12

by this Court, as one of incredible breadth.

13

recently, in United States versus Zandford, this Court

14

concluded that the "in connection with the purchase or

15

sale" language means anything that coincides with a

16

securities transaction.

17

case -- it is conceded by the Respondent at page 8 of his

18

brief -- that the conduct alleged by the plaintiff below

19

is in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.

20

There really can be no other conclusion.

21

paragraphs in the pleadings, appearing, among others, at

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kasner, may I just

1

that, for SEC-enforcement purposes, for prosecutorial

2

purposes, the "in connection with" is as broad as you

3

suggest.

same statute, in difference contexts, to mean different

7

things.

8

But for purposes of private actions, it isn't

It is possible for the same words, even in the

MR. KASNER:

Justice Ginsburg, I believe that

9

this Court has answered Your Honor's question in the Blue

10

Chip Stamp case, where it specifically rejected that sort

11

of an approach, and the one that was consistent with the

12

court below.

13

of course, was a civil case involving an alleged holder's

14

claim was a class action -- what this Court said, for

15

purposes of a civil proceeding, is, "purchase or seller

16

requirement nowhere appears in the statutory language."

17

The statute clearly says "in connection with the purchase

18

or sale of securities."

19

Court concluded, Your Honor, that a violation of 10(b)(5)

20

had been alleged, notwithstanding going on to conclude

21

that the plaintiff could not recover, as a matter of

22

private cause of action.

23

What the Court, in Blue Chip Stamp -- which,

But, as a statutory matter, this

So, we understand -- we believe, Your Honor,

24

that it -- and it is undisputed on this record -- that all

25

parties agree, as the court below concluded, that this -

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress intended to impart 10(b)(5) interpretation as a

2

statutory matter into SLUSA.

3

Ginsburg, that, were Your Honors to conclude that somehow

4

"in connection with" means something different in a civil

5

context, a narrower reading than in the broader context,

6

that would, of course, violate, in our view, the rule of

7

lenity that is applied by this Court.

8

what we believe to be the first time, insofar as we have

9

been able to determine -- and Respondent cites no

It would also mark

16

Because, on criminal, it is as broad as can

I didn't know that there was a rule of lenity that

MR. KASNER:

Your Honor, we -- and we have cited

17

authority, including the Leocal decision of this Court,

18

last year, in which, for statutory construction purposes,

19

where you have a civil and a criminal statute that has

20

both elements to it, the rule of lenity would dictate that

21

the narrower reading be the one that is written.

22

other words, if this Court were to have concluded, in Blue

23

Chip -- excuse me -- in United States versus O'Hagan,

24

that, as a criminal matter, the "in connection with"

25

language is not tethered to the purchase or sale by a

particular party in the case, that is a broader reading

2

than the reading that the court below adopted in a civil

3

case.

4

lenity would suggest that, if this Court, in U.S. v.

5

O'Hagan, took the view that the "purchase or sale"

6

requirement does not apply in a criminal context, that

7

should also apply in a civil context, that a narrower

8

reading should not be imparted into a civil context than

9

you would find in a criminal context.

And so, what we're urging is that the rule of

10

We also -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But one reason you might

12

want to adopt a narrower reading, though, is, we're

13

dealing here with the preemption provision.

14

thing to say that, when you're talking about the SEC's

15

enforcement powers, you adopt a broad reading; but it's

16

quite another thing, when you're talking about displacing

17

State law, that you would necessarily adopt the same broad

18

reading.

19

MR. KASNER:

It's one

Mr. Chief Justice, I think, in this

20

case, there is no other purpose to be served by this

21

statute than to preempt.

22

Your Honor's question is a question with respect to the

23

so-called presumption against preemption, we don't think

24

that those concerns, or the concerns to which Your Honor

25

just referred, apply in this case, because the statute is

used, and hence -- and it would have made no sense, Mr.

Chief Justice, for Congress to have -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But there's a lot of -

I think our cases establish that a phrase like "in

No.

And yet, you know, theoretically it

It's a -- there's a lot of ambiguity in

MR. KASNER:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I would

16

agree with you that, in terms of deciding, for -- as a

17

substantive matter, for purposes of 10(b)(5), "in

18

connection with," such as in SEC versus Zandford, how far

19

the outer reaches of the "in connection with" language go

20

may well be susceptible of differences of opinion.

21

is no difference of opinion to which there can be any

22

disagreement, in this case, about the plain language of

23

the preemption, because the conduct -- no matter what the

24

conduct is that is involved "in connection with the

25

purchase or sale of securities," one thing that is totally

There

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

crystal clear, based on this Court's cases and

2

congressional purpose, is that the "in connection with the

3

purchase or sale" language, as used here, does not

4

restrict its application to the purchase or sale by the

5

plaintiff such that -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but that's a normal

7

reading of the words, wouldn't you -- when you say a

8

purchase or -- it normally would be "in connection with

9

the purchase or sale of securities by the party to the

10

litigation."

11

then you say, "Well, we have cases out there that construe

12

it a little more narrowly."

13

unusual -- and I know it's not totally unusual -- for

14

Congress to preempt a State cause of action that without

15

-- where there is no parallel Federal remedy.

16

That would be your first take on it.

MR. KASNER:

But

And is it not somewhat

Justice Stevens, one misimpression

17

I believe that the court below was under, and I believe is

18

perpetuated by Respondent in his amici, this statute does

not preempt a State-law claim.

cases, for example -

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This is not like the

MR. KASNER:

It preempts class actions.

it's significant, because Congress made a policy judgment.

the Commission in concluding that the purchaser/seller

23

rule is not a limitation on the scope of the prohibition

24

in section 10(b).

25

that were adopted, that would not be the case.

And if your interpretation were the one

MR. HUNGAR:

I always thought "the" meant

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And "his or her" means "his or

MR. HUNGAR:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor.

10

MR. HUNGAR:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. HUNGAR:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14
15

"any," right?

And, again -

No, but you --

-- if it -- think it means "any."

I'm sorry?
You think it means

You're reading "the" to mean "any."

MR. HUNGAR:

Right, it's "the" -- well, it's

16

"the," in the sense of "the activity of purchasing and

17

selling securities," yes.

18

Court has interpreted, in the O'Hagan case, for -- if that

19

interpretation -- if "the" were read as "his or her," then

20

it's impossible to see how the SEC could bring an

21

enforcement action, or the Justice Department could bring

22

a prosecution, in a case like O'Hagan, where the -- where

23

the Court specifically said that the purchaser or seller

24

was not defrauded.

25

section 10(b) requires that the purchaser or seller be

It's -- and that's how this

It's not that -- it's not true that

defrauded.

2

And so, we submit that this would be -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, it certainly doesn't

3

require the Commission to be a purchaser or seller,

4

either.

5
6

You know MR. HUNGAR:

Well, we certainly would agree with

that, Your Honor, that -

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

8

MR. HUNGAR:

9

Yes.

But, more generally, it doesn't

require that there be a purchaser or seller who's

10

defrauded, and yet the purchaser/seller rule, for the

11

purpose of implied actions, does require that.

12

Justice Stevens, you asked about whether there

13

is any indication in the legislative history that Congress

14

intended this act to preempt class-action claims where

15

there would be no Federal remedy.

16

absolutely yes.

17

legislative history that Congress knew, and expected, that

18

claims that could be brought under State law as class

19

actions, such as aiding-and-abetting claims or negligent-

20

misrepresentation claims, claims that would not satisfy

21

the Federal -

The answer to that is,

It is perfectly clear from the

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23

MR. HUNGAR:

Right.

-- scienter requirements for -

24

and, of course, the claims that would not satisfy the

25

requirements of the PSLRA.

None of those could be brought

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in Federal court, because they're barred by the various

2

provisions of Federal law.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but they would be at -

4

adjudged under a different standard, you're dead right.

5

As far as the parties involved, the -- that's what I was

6

really asking.

7

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, in cases where the -- where

8

the only claim is against aiders and abetters, those

9

parties would be -- would be out of court; or, likewise,

10

cases where parties could not satisfy the scienter

11

requirement, those parties would be out of court.

12

Congress knew that it would be foreclosing remedies for

13

certain categories of claims, and that was part of the

14

point of the act, as the conference committee report makes

15

clear.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. HUNGAR:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So,

What about the -

Congress was -- the claim that's made

19

here, the second claim, where the broker said, "We lost

20

clients, so -- as a result of this deception -- and we

21

want to be compensated for that," nothing about the

22

inflated price of the security -

MR. HUNGAR:

don't trust us anymore, because we gave them such bad

advice."
MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, the -- that issue is

not before this Court -

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

MR. HUNGAR:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I know, but I -

-- because it was not -- wanted to know what the

7

Government's position was on that claim.

8

brought in a State court -

9

MR. HUNGAR:

Could that be

The -

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. HUNGAR:

-- even as a class action?

The Commission addressed that

12

question in its amicus brief in the Court of Appeals, and

13

took the position that that claim was not in connection

14

with the purchase or sale of securities, because the

15

injury occurs after the fraud has been completed, and is

16

- and has to do with the lost future relationship, rather

17

than fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of

18

securities.

19

here, obviously, but the Commission took the position,

20

below, that that would not be preempted, because it's not

21

in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.

22

And so, we didn't address that in our brief

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you deal with the

23

Court's -- the footnote in the Blue Chip Stamp -- that

24

the court says -- in the Federal court -- "these 10(b)

25

actions have to be limited to actual purchasers and

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

sellers," but that limitation is attenuated, because

2

deserving claims by nontraders would lie under State law,

3

including the very suit that was involved in Blue Chip

4

Stamps and in the Second Circuit case that paved the way

5

for Blue Chip?

6

MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, that was an accurate

7

description of the state of the law, as it existed at the

8

time, at least in theory, although, as a practical matter,

9

Respondents have not been able to point to a single

10

reported case a -- of a holder class action in State court

11

prior to the adoption of the Uniform Standards Act.

12

while it was true, as a theoretical matter, that such

13

claims could be brought under the law of some States,

14

there are -- there is no history of State class actions in

15

this area, which is one of the reasons why we think the

16

reliance on the assumption of nonpreemption makes no sense

17

here.

18

brought in Federal court, and it was only the PSLRA that

19

resulted in cases, such as the type of case at issue here,

20

being brought in State courts.

21

saw that problem, Congress was concerned that the

22

requirements of the PSLRA were being evaded, and it was

23

also concerned, as the conference committee report makes

24

clear, that, now that these securities class actions were

25

being brought in State court, there was the potential

So,

Securities class actions prior to the PSLRA were

And Congress -- once it

22
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

danger of 50 varying State standards being applied, as

2

this very case suggests, and Congress acted to remedy both

3

of those problems, as the conference committee report

4

makes clear, both the risk of nonuniformity in securities

5

class actions that are targeted by the act, and the risk

6

of evasion of the PSLRA.

7

Respondent's position would frustrate both of

8

those objectives, because it would -- it would permit the

9

most abusive category of lawsuits to proceed in State

10

court, and it would permit such holder claims to be

11

brought -- for instance, based on negligence, if State law

12

permitted that; based on conduct that would be protected

13

by the Federal safe harbor for forward-looking statements

14

under the PSLRA.

15

frustrated by their interpretation.

16

So, the PSLRA protections would be

So, the very goals that Congress explicitly

17

sought to achieve, stated in the -- in the text of the

18

statute, in the purposes section and also in the

19

conference committee report, would be frustrated.

20

again, that approach requires the Court to accept an

21

inconsistent interpretation of the text of the "in

22

connection with" requirement, depending on the identity of

23

the plaintiff, which would be an extraordinary way to

24

construe a statute, particularly when there's nothing in

25

the legislative history that provides even a hint of a

And,

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

suggestion that Congress would have intended that result.

2

And with respect to Blue Chip, Your Honor, it's

3

important to remember what Blue Chip was doing.

4

was not a case about the scope of the "in connection with"

5

requirement or the section 10(b) prohibition.

6

was a case about what to infer about what Congress would

7

have wanted to authorize as an -- as a right of action, if

8

it had addressed the question.

9

Chip court made very clear that the conduct at issue there

Blue Chip

Instead, it

And that's why the Blue

10

involving injuries to holders can be a violation of

11

section 10(b) -- i.e., it can be in connection with the

12

purchase or sale of securities -- it's just that they did

13

not think that Congress would have wanted to authorize a

14

private right of action.

15

So, again, when we're talking about the scope of

16

the "in connection with" requirement, which is what is at

17

issue here, that approach is the same approach that should

18

be followed here, the same approach that was in -

19

followed in O'Hagan and in Zandford, and compels the

20

conclusion that, since the conduct at issue here is

21

unquestionably "in connection with the purchase and sale

22

of securities," as this Court has construed that phrase,

23

it is preempted by the Uniform Standards Act.

24
25

If the Court has no further questions, I thank
the Court.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, you want us to interpret

the text two ways, depending on the purpose.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

15

understand what Congress intended.

16

intended, in SLUSA, I think is quite clear if you start at

17

the beginning of the statute and you just start reading

18

your way through it, because what Congress did in SLUSA

19

was attempt to stop a flight of cases that had been

20

brought in Federal court heretofore, but were migrating to

State court, Congress perceived, as a result of the

22

enactment of the PSLRA.

standards.

attempting to ratchet up the pleading requirements for

Federal-law claims.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So -- it's so

23

counterintuitive.

24

holder claims lend themselves to abuse much more than do

25

the narrow purchase-and-sale claims.

that you're talking about, Justice Scalia, would be a

classic purchaser/seller-type claim, and you can bring

that in Federal court.

do about the same thing, when you talk about a person who

to say, "Congress thought -- Congress thought an

findings, are that the particular harm that Congress was

addressing in SLUSA -- this was a narrow -- you know, this

23

was a narrowly framed preemption as to Federal-law claims,

You -

-- one of the strange things

about this case and the SEC's position is that district

courts are going to be put in the rather unusual position

11

of paying a rather high cost, because if they are

confronted with a removal of a case brought under State

13

law, where the defendant asserts that it is preempted

14

under SLUSA, and the SEC hasn't taken any action at all,

15

and has expressed no interest in this particular area, the

16

district court, to determine preemption, has to intuit

17

whether or not this is within the SEC's enforcement

authority.

19

private plaintiffs suing for wrongdoing on the same side

of the case as the SEC, as the public enforcer.

Ultimately, what Merrill Lynch here is asserting

11

is an immunity for a fraud that uniquely affects a certain

law.

14

to get an immunity from an intentional fraud, the party

bears a heavy presumption that that is, in fact, what

Congress intended.

with the language of the statute, the findings that

Congress made in the legislative history, Congress did not

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I agree with that presumption

against preemption, where the question is, Does this

23

Federal statute, which says nothing about preemption,

accidentally preempt some State law? -- that there, the

25

presumption makes sense.
