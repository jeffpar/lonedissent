ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

We'll hear argument

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The complaint in this case actually alleges

11

that Domino's breached its obligations under a contract

12

with JWM.

13

McDonald's own contracts were violated.

14

It does not allege that any of the terms of

The Ninth Circuit, nevertheless, held that

15

Mr. McDonald could recover damages so long as he could

16

show that he had suffered some distinct injury arising

17

out of the violation of the contract between his

18

company and Domino's.

19
20
21

We -- we ask this Court to reverse that
holding for two principal reasons.
First, Mr. McDonald did not hold any rights

22

under the contracts between his company JWM and

23

Domino's, and that's disqualifying under section 1981.

24
25

Second, the injuries that he alleges are
simply too indirect to be cognizable under an implied

right of action.

2

express rights of action, whether RICO or the Clayton

3

Act, has looked to the background principles of the

4

common law to define the scope of a damage recovery.

5

And these kinds of injuries, which are really the

6

classic form of derivative injury, have never been

7

recoverable.

8
9

This Court, even in the context of

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mahoney, just in -- in a case where the person is

damages?

What are the other

MS. MAHONEY:

MS. MAHONEY:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MS. MAHONEY:

If -- if you're

That's correct.
-- in your own behalf.

Absolutely.

There is no

21

standalone cause of action under Federal law simply for

22

emotional distress that is suffered as a result of

23

racially discriminatory conduct.

24

you know, might do that some day, but it has not done

25

so.

Presumably Congress,

And in fact, even under title VII, racially

disparaging comments can cause distress to a worker and

2

they're still not actionable unless it rises to the

3

level of a hostile work environment.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what was the

5

plaintiff's -- it wasn't here.

6

was he asking for?

7

MS. MAHONEY:

What kind of damages

He is asking -- it's -- it's --

8

the complaint is a little unclear, but he's asking for

9

losses that arise out of the company's failure to have

10

revenues that would have passed through the company to

11

him in either his capacity as a shareholder or possibly

12

as an employee.

13

indirect these injuries really are.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In fact, it's important to stress how
The gravamen --

Well, I thought they were --

15

they were essentially, as I guess you said a moment

16

ago, emotional distress kinds of injuries because

17

otherwise he'd be claiming a double recovery.

18

doesn't do that because they -- they settled the

19

contract case with the corporation for what?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So he

$45,000, Your Honor.

understand it, or am I wrong?

that he submitted to the district court, he said that

3

his net worth had declined 8 million dollars and he is

4

saying that he --

5

He doesn't specify them, but in an affidavit

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I -- I guess that's

6

where I went wrong.

7

that he was claiming that he had been distressed

8

emotionally.

12

I thought those were the reasons

MS. MAHONEY:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you're -- you're saying

he wants the -MS. MAHONEY:

But either way, the outcome

13

should be the same because emotional distress is not a

14

standalone claim.

15

rights to make and enforce a contract that were

16

violated, and even if he did that, he still has to show

17

that the damages that -- that were caused by Domino's

were sufficiently direct to be cognizable.

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, I think there's a

2

couple of problems with that.

3

these were contracts where Domino's had rights under

4

these contracts as well, and if it had sued Mr.

5

McDonald under the terms of the contract for failing to

6

perform, he would have rightly said, that's not my

7

contract.

8
9

I mean, first of all,

And I don't think that we can think that
Congress intended this Court to simply disregard those

10

principles that have always governed where you -- if

11

you take the benefits of avoiding liability, you can't

12

turn around and say, well, now that it's time to

13

recover against Domino's, it is my contract.

14

force of the law when he's taken the benefits of the

corporate processes, and he won't be able to have an

independent claim for emotional distress.

It's one that says that the recovery that is owed

2

that that policy interferes with his ability to make

3

contracts with his company to be the CEO?

Couldn't that CEO, the individual, claim

MS. MAHONEY:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

Well -And shouldn't he then

have a right to bring a claim under section 1981?

7

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, if his company

8

fired him because he couldn't make contracts -- in

9

other words, they said, we -- we don't want you to be

10

our CEO.

11

we're going to lose business with these other companies

12

-- then I think under an interference theory, that he

13

probably could sue under 1981, sue both his company and

14

also the third party that induced the interference.

15

We don't want a black CEO because, after all,

If we look to common law principles, the

16

common law of tortious interference established various

17

rules that were designed to provide recovery for

18

interference when the causation was sufficiently

19

direct, and the common law says -- this is section 766

20

of the Restatement and cases that follow that -- that,

21

in essence, if the third party -- or if the defendant

22

induces the breach, essentially, you know, tells them,

23

this is how we want it done, we want you to fire so and

24

so if you want our business, if they induce the breach

25

or induce the violation, then they can be liable as

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but -- but in this

19

case, it's pretty obvious they didn't care about the

20

corporation.

21

They cared about him.

MS. MAHONEY:

He was the target.

Well, he may have been the

22

reason for the discrimination, but the target, in terms

23

of the direct victim of the conduct that is alleged,

24

was clearly JWM.

It's JWM whose contracts were

2

the law has made it clear that simply breaching a

3

contract in a manner that makes it more difficult for

4

somebody else to perform is not a sufficiently direct

5

cause of the -- of the failure to perform all of the

6

succeeding downstream contracts.

7

rules of privity would simply be eroded.

it's a very narrow category of cases where a breach of

19

the plaintiff's contract can be performed or not.

20

in that circumstance, if -- if I deny approval on the

22

the other parties to perform.

If, for instance, there

I mean, looking at the theory of damage in
this case shows just how indirect it is.

If you look

10

at paragraphs 24 through 27 of the complaint, the sole

11

theory of harm here is that Domino's had an obligation

12

to provide a letter to -- to JWM, certifying that JWM

13

wasn't in breach of any terms of the lease, and that it

14

refused to provide that letter, and when it did so, the

15

bank denied some financing on a project, and then that

16

caused JWM not to have money to invest in other

projects.

pay its creditors, and so then it went into -- had to

But in respect to the civil rights law, I

7

guess your position is -- and this is what I want to

8

know -- that whatever those doctrines are, they have to

9

be the same for white people as for black people.

10

MS. MAHONEY:

I think the language of the

11

statute says that it's protecting the -- the right of

12

all -- the same right to make and enforce --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

So -- so it might apply.

14

And one thing you couldn't do if you're a State is have a

15

different rule for black people that treated them worse

16

than white people.

17
18
19

MS. MAHONEY:

I think that's correct, Your

Honor, but -JUSTICE BREYER:

And has there

20

ever been a case in respect, whether it's affirmative

21

action or some other thing, that interprets that --

22

that -- this particular civil rights statute to say

people are entitled to more protection under contract

law than white?

MS. MAHONEY:

though -- I mean, certainly though -- of course, the

Court in McDonald did interpret this statute to -- to

also protect white person -- white -- white people,

6

people of all color, despite the language that says,

MS. MAHONEY:

No, they don't, Your Honor, but

11

all of the courts of appeals have, in effect, imputed

12

race to corporations under circumstances where their --

13

their contractual rights have been violated because of

14

the race of their shareholders or employees.

15

has been well-settled, at least in the courts of

16

appeals.

17
18

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that

So how do we deal with this?

That is to say, do I have to become an expert on

19

contract law, or do I say to the Ninth Circuit or the

20

circuit, look, the -- the question here is not what the

21

contract law is except insofar as it's relevant to

22

whether there's a differential in treatment?

23

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't

24

think you have to be an expert on contract law.

25

think that this Court already held in Patterson, for

I

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

instance, that section 1981 was designed to have its

2

own Federal content, but that when we look at the term,

3

the right to make and enforce contracts, certainly we

4

have to interpret that in light of common law rules.

5

And under the common law of contracts, only parties and

6

third party beneficiaries have -- hold rights under

7

those contracts.

8
9

Under section 302 of the Restatement, it
defines who a third party beneficiary is, and I think

10

that's a good starting place.

11

children, you know, as in this Court's case in Runyon,

12

are third party beneficiaries.

13

party beneficiaries of collective bargaining agreements

14

under that -- under the comments in the Restatement.

15

But the plaintiff acknowledges that the shareholders

16

and employees are not intended third party

17

beneficiaries of the contract.

18

It shows us that

Union members are third

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, maybe not --

19

maybe not shareholders in general, but what if you have

20

a situation, like here, where you're dealing with sole

21

shareholders?

22

that person is a third party beneficiary of the

23

contracts of his corporation?

24
25

Why is that a real stretch to say that

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, the -- for two reasons.

First, the contract has to actually identify third

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

party beneficiaries.

2

agree on who the third -- on who the beneficiaries are

3

supposed to be.

4

in the contracts.

5

anything in the contracts to identify him as that.

In other words, parties need to

And here, of course, there's nothing
They haven't alleged there's

6

And also, if -- if --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There was nothing in

8

these contracts requiring anything in the way of

9

personal guarantees or anything of that sort?

10
11

MS. MAHONEY:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

It's certainly not alleged in the complaint that there

12

is a personal guarantee.

13

because when Domino's sued JWM, it did not sue Mr.

14

McDonald.

15

sure Mr. McDonald would have put up his hand and said,

16

no, thank you, that's not my contract.

17

And -- and I don't think so

And -- and as I say, if -- if they had, I'm

And I -- so I don't -- I think that really

18

what we are asking the Court to do is just to look at

19

the language and -- and read it in light of these well-

20

established principles because that's what Congress

21

would have intended the Court to do, and that he is not

22

a third party beneficiary.

23

the Ninth -- the rationale of the Ninth Circuit would

24

need to be reversed because that's all it relied upon.

25

And then the alternative theory --

He is not a party.

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, I don't think we need to

that Mr. McDonald is not a third party beneficiary

MS. MAHONEY:

I -- I think, Your Honor, that

19

in -- in the prior cases, in Patterson in particular,

20

that the Court rejected the idea that it ought to be

21

the State -- the law of each State that governs the

22

scope of the rights.

23

advanced by the Solicitor General, and this Court said,

24

no, they didn't think that was correct.

25

That argument, I believe, was

And similarly, in Haddle v. Garrison, which

law.

But it -- it said that it's really Federal common

4

So I think it's looking just to -- to State

law principles to inform what Congress may have had in

mind when it -- it allowed for persons to recover for

7

violations of the rights to make and enforce contracts.

Here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But is it State law

today or State law back when section 1981 was passed?

11

MS. MAHONEY:

This Court has looked to both,

12

but in Associated General -- Associated General

13

Contractors, for instance, this Court said that it's

14

not bound by the terms of common law that existed at

15

the time that the statute was adopted, and -- but

16

rather, that common law evolves, and so it's

17

appropriate to -- to look beyond that.

18

I think it bears emphasis, though, that the

19

common law of tortious interference at the time that

20

this statute was adopted in 1866 was narrower than it

21

is today.

22

interference, the plaintiffs concede that they would

23

not be able to recover under those theories, and

24

instead, have said to this Court 1981 should be -- go

25

well beyond the terms of common law interference

But even under the broader views of tortious

this is stronger than some tortious interference claims

because here the target is this -- this party.

MS. MAHONEY:

That's always true in tortious

interference claims, Your Honor, and -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You mean that -- that the

injured party has to be the target?
MS. MAHONEY:

Absolutely.

The injured party

10

has to allege that the defendant knew about the

11

contract and specifically intended to interfere with

12

the performance of the plaintiff's contract.

13

nevertheless, we know of no --

MS. MAHONEY:

But,

To interfere but not

And to injure.

Well, to injure

17

him, to prevent his performance for -- for purposes of

18

injury, yes.

19

And, nevertheless, we are aware of no case

20

that has ever found that an employee of a company or a

21

shareholder of a company could recover under common law

22

tortious interference theory simply because it suffered

23

losses arising out of a breach of contract with its own

24

corporation that made it more difficult or more

25

expensive for the corporation to recover.

1

And I think it -- it is -- also bears

2

emphasis of where this theory would take the Court if

3

it were to recognize this.

4

the core requirement that there not be discrimination

5

in the terms of an employment contract because this --

6

the tortious interference theory, of course, is based

7

solely on the concept that he may have had some sort of

8

implied employment agreement with JWM.

9

It would go far afield from

What this would mean then is that if -- in

10

the case of GM, if a major customer cancels a contract

11

and GM doesn't give raises to its work force, all of

12

the black workers would have causes of action because

13

of the injuries that were intended because the contract

14

was canceled on the basis of race, but their similarly

15

situated white coworkers would not.

16

suffered exactly the same injury, but they would have

17

completely different rights.

18

derivative injury theory just doesn't fit section 1981

19

because at its core, it has to be about preventing

20

discrimination in the terms of the actual contract.

21

And here, there is no allegation that JWM

They would have

2

road to recognize this -- this kind of theory.
So I don't -- I don't think that we are

3

asking the Court to do anything radical, and I think

4

the whole issue of tortious interference can be

5

avoided, if the Court would prefer, because the -- the

6

theory was unquestionably waived.

7

There are 14 paragraphs of facts in this

8

complaint laying out the factual allegations.

Paragraph 11 says that Mr. McDonald is the president,

10

sole shareholder, and operator of the company.

11

in those 14 paragraphs does it say that he had an

employment contract with JWM.

13

Nowhere

Similarly, the cause of action paragraphs --

14

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN LICHTENSTEIN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

5

The issue here is whether, by choosing to

6

operate as a solely owned corporation, John McDonald

7

forfeited his 1981 protection.

8

Rather than federalizing State contract law,

9

section 1981 imposes a nonnegotiable nondiscrimination

10

duty that is neither a contractual provision nor

11

governed by contract law.

12

discrimination is not merely a breach of contract

13

terms.

14

is more akin to a tort.

Intentional racial

As this Court has already noticed -- noted, it

15

Domino's question presented asks that both

16

plaintiff and defendant had to be parties to the

17

contract.

18

privy of contract are also protected, citing third

19

party beneficiaries and the fact there were employers,

20

such as supervisory employees or prime contractors.

21

Thus, even Domino's concedes that the answer to the

22

question presented is no.

23

not limited to parties to the contract.

24
25

Yet, Domino's notes that non-parties without

Section 1981 protection is

There's still, however, the remaining
question of whether John McDonald fits within the

statute's protection.

2

proprietor, there would be no question of stating a

3

cause of action.

based on three grounds:

5

section 1981; two, John McDonald's relationship with

6

Domino's; and three, John McDonald's relationship with

7

JWM.

has been sufficiently raised below.

1

presented was -- was precisely if your client did not

alleging, be enough to confer standing?

5

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Well, it's -- the

6

allegation of both -- well, discrimination is a

personal injury.

8

9

not a contract injury.

It's

So the question presented --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the question is -- I

11

mean, that begs the question, whether there has been a

violation of section 1981, and the argument here is

13

that there's no violation of section 1981 unless you're

14

interfering with a contract of the plaintiff.

15

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

And the response of the --

16

of the respondent is it is not simply your own contract

17

or your contract with the defendant that is subject to

18

1981 protection.

19

we've cited them in our brief -- such as Shaare Tefila

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -Which you didn't allege and

didn't even raise in the brief in opposition here.

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

I -- I think we alleged

that in terms of the ability of Mr. McDonald to perform

on the contract, even though it was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's exactly the issue.

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's --

-- and that's how I

And can you -- can you sustain a lawsuit for the

violation of that contract?

any other contract.

4

back down so you can mention a contract that you

5

haven't even thought of even when you filed the brief

6

in opposition.

7

There was no mention of

I don't know why we should send it

So that's the issue, whether the violation of

8

the contract between McDonald -- between Domino's and

9

your client's corporation will allow your client to get

10

-- to get some damages inasmuch as he was the target.

11

That's how I understood the lawsuit.

12
13

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Well, that is clearly the

main thrust of -- of our position.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, could you tell me when

15

-- the -- the claim was settled when your client's

16

corporation was in bankruptcy.

17

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right?

Yes.

And I assume your client had

19

no -- nothing to say about -- about whether the

20

settlement would be -- would be accepted by the trustee

21

or not.

22
23
24
25

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Absolutely.

He -- it was

out of his hands.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was out of his hands,

which means that, you know, you're -- you're sort of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

pleading the advantage of a corporation, limited

2

liability and all of that, and went through bankruptcy

3

taking that advantage, one of the consequences of which

4

was that you left it to the corporation to settle this

5

claim.

6

And now you want to disclaim the advantage of

7

a corporation and say, oh, although the -- you know,

8

the corporation settled it out -- you know, I was no

9

longer in control of it because of the bankruptcy -- I

10

want to bring the claim on my own.

11

understand why it would be nice for you to get that,

12

but it doesn't seem to me that you should be able to

13

play dog in the manger that way.

14

either accept the corporate form or you don't.

It certainly is not going to protect any

22

at a minimum that now that the corporation has settled

23

the breach of contract claim, that to the extent that

24

the corporation could have recovered under 1981, that's

25

gone too because those two claims were intimately

37
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

related, and you would be precluded from bringing such

2

a claim.

3

face a res judicata bar.

4

So to the extent that there's an overlap, you

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Your Honor, even if that

5

claim had not been precluded by bankruptcy -- and there

6

were two plaintiffs in this case, JWM and McDonald --

7

there certainly couldn't be double recovery.

8

that would be recoverable in any form by JWM clearly

9

cannot be recovered by John McDonald as an individual.

10

And the Ninth Circuit said that.

They were talking

11

about his own separate and distinct injuries.

12

double recovery would never be possible.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Anything

So

So they -- the Ninth

14

Circuit's view is there are two potential plaintiffs in

15

this situation.

16

damages are not identical.

Both can sue and one gets -- the
That's --

17

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

I'm sorry.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The shareholder can sue.

19
20

The sole shareholder can sue.
Both have 1981 claims.

The corporation can sue.

It's not either/or.

21

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Correct.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They both have 1981

23

claims, but the damages are different in the case of

24

the individual than in the case of the corporation.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

individual plaintiff assert the 1981 claim at any time

3

before the settlement of the corporate claim?

4

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Yes, I believe that the --

5

and I would have to check on the timing of this, but I

6

believe that the suit was filed prior to the settlement

7

of the 1981 claim -- of the bankruptcy --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

10

I would have assumed -I'm sorry.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- there wouldn't have been

a settlement first without taking care of the second,

And again, we are looking at this particular

situation.

claims.

There is no one who has a race in this case that is

It was John McDonald.

Here, you have a situation where -- and

discriminated against, can't recover but some other

9

That sort of turns section 1981 on its

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it was his -- it was

his corporation, and until he went bankrupt, any

10

recovery by that corporation would have been a recovery

11

by -- by John McDonald.

12

problem is the fact that -- that the corporation went

13

bankrupt.

14
15

What -- what created your

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Your Honor, I don't think

that's the --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, you know, that's --

17

that's one of the -- one of the consequences of taking

18

advantage of the corporate form.

19

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Your Honor, I don't think

20

that's the case because if there was, for example, this

21

two-party suit, JWM could not recover for dignitary

22

damages.

23

Only an individual can do that.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, can you -- can you do

24

that under a general contract theory?

25

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

I don't believe you can do

it under a general contract --

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you're reporting not

3

merely the -- the tort of tortious interference, but

4

some general, broader concept of tort law as being

5

subsumed with -- under 1981.

6

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Aren't you?
Yes, and I think the --

7

the case law indicates that, that this is not simply

8

just federalization of State law.

9

the history of section 1981, this was designed to

This -- looking at

10

combat not tortious interference claims in common law,

11

but the black codes during Reconstruction that

12

prohibited black individuals, individuals just like

13

John McDonald, from being able to pursue their trades,

14

operate --

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right, but the -- the

16

focus of it is, as -- as I understand it, and the --

17

the kernel of it is -- is the capacity to contract.

18

And we can certainly understand, I guess, how tortious

19

interference with contracts might come under that

20

umbrella, but you're going further and you're saying, I

21

take it, any tort that would give a recovery --

22

recognize a recovery for -- for dignitary injury would

23

be subsumed with -- within the concept of what 1981 was

24

intended to -- to cover, which is a broader

25

proposition.

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

I think that what we are

2

saying I think is what the Court has said -- is that

3

this is a personal injury, and that dignitary claims

4

are subsumed under 1981.

5

I don't think --

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't think it's expand --

Well, contract -- I -- you

7

-- you pointed out the -- the terminology which

8

includes contract damages or -- or contract harm as

9

personal harm, but it doesn't necessarily follow from

10

that that every harm or every injury that is personal

11

falls under -- conceptually under the 1981 umbrella.

12

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

No.

Discrimination is a

13

personal injury.

14

believe in Goodman also.

15

personal injury here, not just contract harm.

16

This Court said that in Burke and I

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So we're talking about

But it doesn't -- it doesn't

17

talk about personal injury that -- that broadly.

18

talks about the right to make and enforce contracts.

19

That's the portion of it you have to be relying upon.

20

It doesn't talk about --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

I believe, Your Honor --

-- dignitary about that.
-- that it goes to your

7

right to not suffer discrimination within the realm of

8

making, performing, and enforcing contracts.

9

is on discrimination, which is a personal injury and a

10

personal harm, and the --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The focus

And you're saying it means

12

discrimination that relates to the making and enforcing

13

of a contract with somebody else.

14

that since the discrimination was targeted at you, even

15

though the contract was with -- was with somebody else,

16

you have a claim under this language of 1981.

17

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

And you're saying

Yes, in this circumstance

19

that was used to target an individual.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

action to -- to every minority employee of General

2

Motors.

3

Isn't that correct?
MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

If there is a

4

circumstance, as I understand the hypothetical, where

5

there is blatant and intentional discrimination, racial

6

discrimination, by a multinational corporation like

7

General Motors, who say we're not going to do business

8

with any company that hires black people -- and clearly

9

there's an uphill battle for any kind of proof, but

10

you'd have to show that there was actual targeting,

11

that it really did interfere with the ability to

12

perform contracts, and that there were specified

13

individual damages.

14

could be proven, that would be pretty egregious and

15

probably something that 1981 should cover.

16

But if that were the case and

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- but when you say

17

damages that can be proven, the only damages you -- you

18

insist upon proving is the fact that you were a target

19

and that it -- it insulted you.

20

know.

21

saying that every -- every minority employee of all of

22

the companies with whom GM, or whoever it is didn't do

23

business, would automatically have a cause of action.

24
25

It -- it was -- you

That's the only damage you require.

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

believe we're saying that because --

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

I don't believe so, and I

12

think that what was pled and what we believe is not just

13

the wages that were not paid, but also the dignitary

14

damages and also the damages specifically aimed at John

15

McDonald in terms of ruining his credit, going to the

16

banks, and in a sense slandering him, and those kinds

17

of damages that were not recoverable by JWM but were

18

specifically John McDonald.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That was -- that was the

20

consequence of the bankruptcy of his corporation.

21

mean, that didn't -- didn't --

22

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

No, sir.

I

There were

23

actually allegations of statements we are going to ruin

24

you personally and actions that went to ruin him

25

personally.

This was not just simply derivative from

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the corporation.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But none of the ruin

3

occurred, as I understand it, until the corporation

4

went bankrupt.

5

the bank, for example, didn't say we're not doing any

6

more business with -- with you, McDonald.

7

understand it, all the -- all the -- leaving dignitary

8

harm aside, all the actual loss was -- was as a

9

consequence of the loss to the corporation.

In other words, there was no direct --

10

11

derivative from the corporate loss.

As I

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

I don't believe so, sir.

13

And the opposition to the motion to dismiss talked very

14

specifically about the statements to the banks that

15

were specific to John McDonald that hurt John McDonald

16

individually that really was not derivative from the

17

bankruptcy --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you have an action --

22

Wouldn't you have an action in the State if somebody

23

goes and deliberately interferes with your credit and

so forth?

25

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

46
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

that Mr. McDonald took was just this, the 1981 action,

2

saying that there was a Federal violation, that this

3

was done to discriminate against him, and this seems to

4

fit in with the 1981 cause of action and the purpose of

5

1981, which is why this case was filed.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If it fits, it's because

7

of some cases.

So to -- to flesh out what

10

that claim is, you must be relying on some decisions of

11

this Court when you talk about dignitary damages.

12

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Well, again, we -- I think

13

we could look at Shaare Tefila as -- as a good example

14

of the kinds of damages.

15

16

This was the Nazi swastika on

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought that didn't

17

go into anything.

18

it was just was there a claim.

19

That was a two-page per curiam, and

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

And it didn't --

Well, the claim was still

20

-- it was certainly not because of any kind of -- of

21

privity.

22

It was damages based on -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that that was

23

about does the -- does the act cover religion or -- or

24

does it cover that situation, or is it limited to race,

25

I thought that's

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

what was all that was decided.

2

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Well, at that time, that

3

-- it said that anti-semitism counted as race, but

4

certainly they were able to recover once that threshold

5

was met because of the dignitary harms.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, I don't see anything

7

in the opinion about -- I just see the issue before the

8

Court was does this come under the heading race.

9
10

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

My reading of that was --

was a bit broader I think.

11

Also, you could look at cases such as

12

Sullivan where the right not to be discriminated

13

against was compensable for the black family that was

14

not allowed into the club.

15

cited --

16

So the cases that we have

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Both Sullivan and

17

Shaare Tefila, of course, though, were 1982 cases.

18

Right?

19

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. LICHTENSTEIN:

Correct.
Not 1981 cases.

Right.

But this Court has

22

said that the language is so similar that they should,

23

for these purposes, be viewed as having the same rules.

24
25

And clearly, it would make no sense to have -- have
different ones.

So they were 1982 claims, but the idea

48
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that discrimination in terms of housing should have

dignitary claims while discrimination in terms of

said.

there is any need for a remand.

14

The district court dismissed the complaint

15

with prejudice, and I think that it's fair to say that

16

at that point, the plaintiff was under an obligation to

seek leave to amend if it had any other alternative

18

theory that it wanted to advance in this case.

19

Otherwise, we're left with the situation where they can

supposedly violated, as well as, you know, the other

2

elements.

3

Second, I think that if this were a harder

4

case about tortious interference principles, even if it

5

hadn't been waived, I might understand the Court's

6

reluctance to get into it.

7

briefing that the plaintiff has conceded that his claim

8

would not be cognizable under the common law of

9

contract, third party beneficiary, or tortious

But we know from the

10

interference, and that is very plain from the brief at

11

pages, I think, 43 through 46 where they acknowledge

12

that under section 76 of the Restatement, they would

13

not be able to -- to recover.

14

This isn't a federalized version of common law of

15

interference.

16

And they say, so what.

So given that concession, I think all this

17

Court would have to say is that the alternative theory

18

that wasn't even pled can't possibly state a claim

19

because it -- it asks us to go far beyond what the

20

common law did.

ask you one brief question that I should have asked on

direct?

I hope you have time for it.
But supposing a fact situation in which a

MS. MAHONEY:

I think the corporation would,

Your Honor.

Would the

You think the corporation

would.

10

MS. MAHONEY:

Absolutely because they -- a

11

refusal to deal -- it covers rights to make and enforce

12

contracts, and if -- if the defendant said, I will not

13

deal with this company, then I think that they have a

14

right.

15

And in this case, there was a claim that was

16

brought by the company for -- based on -- for breach of

17

contract.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

MS. MAHONEY:

But not under 1981.

No, Your Honor, but the trustee

20

makes a finding that the -- the causation -- or reports

21

to the court that causation principles could not be

22

established, and so there was no point in bringing a

23

1981 claim because he actually found in -- in materials

24

that are in the record of the bankruptcy proceeding --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But -- but in your view, to

the extent that racial discrimination might have

2

affected negotiations, that would be an element of the

3

corporation's claim under 1981 rather than an

4

individual claim.

MS. MAHONEY:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, Your Honor.
Yes.

Because if the -- if they were

8

negotiating on behalf of the company, that is the

company's right to contract.

It is not the

individual's right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you attribute the

shareholder's race to the corporation?
MS. MAHONEY:

That's what the courts of

14

appeals all do.

15

Freedom Theater looked at this issue and said that it

16

was the best way to approach this issue, that -- that

17

-- and explained that it doesn't make sense to impute

18

the corporation's contract rights to somebody else,

19

give them power to enforce their contract rights.

20

it wasn't a 1981 case, but it was analogous, and that

21

it made sense to, under those circumstances, impute

22

race, in effect.

And

And I think that the way that courts have

24

done it is also a link to the word discrimination,

25

which appears in 1981(c).

that a -- a male coach had been subjected to

discrimination on the basis of sex, even though he's

obviously not a woman, because it's a form of

discrimination.

that as well.

And I think the courts have looked at

But this -- the -- the -- all of the exact

same issues that are alleged in this complaint were

already raised and litigated through depositions and

all of the problems that this Court addressed in

Associated General Contractors about why there's such a
