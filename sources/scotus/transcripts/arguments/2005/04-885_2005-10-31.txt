ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. THRO

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. THRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

10

This case involves a conflict between two

11

constitutional values.

12

sovereign power to make laws which apply to everyone, including

13

the States.

14

immunity from all aspects of suit.

15

On the one hand, Congress has the

On the other hand, the States have sovereign

In the past, this Court has reconciled this conflict

16

by drawing a line between sovereign power and sovereign

17

immunity.

18

immune from monetary damages for violations of those laws.

19

In the bankruptcy context, this line means the

States are bound by Federal law, but the States are

20

States are bound by the discharge decisions, but that the States

21

are immune from the trustee's attempts to augment the estate

22

through monetary judgment.

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Can you tell us how often States

24

are creditors in bankruptcies around the country?

25

any idea?

Do you have

MR. THRO:

There is some information to that effect

2

in the amicus brief of Ohio and every other State of the Union,

3

Justice O'Connor, but my recollection is that the States are

4

creditors in probably the majority of bankruptcies around the

5

country.

6

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So, if you're correct, how would

7

the result you want affect all the other creditors in these

8

bankruptcies?

9

MR. THRO:

It would have some impact on the other

10

creditors, in that you would not be able to augment the estate

11

by collecting a monetary judgment from the State.

12
13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And probably, on your theory,

States can disregard the automatic stay that issues --

14

MR. THRO:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. THRO:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. THRO:

No, not at all --- when a bankruptcy --

-- Your Honor.

Under our -- under our theory, the

The automatic stay is an exercise of

Well, why don't we say that that's

the exercise of the sovereign power of commerce, just -- of
Congress, just like you said?

11

MR. THRO:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That --

The automatic -I mean, it seems that that answer

13

is just conclusory, that it's an exercise of the sovereign power

14

of Congress, okay.

15

That's not a reason.

16

That's just -- that's just a conclusion.

MR. THRO:

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- this Court's

17

decisions have struck a balance between respecting the need for

18

the States to obey Federal law and, at the same time, respecting

19

the constitutional value of the States' sovereign immunity.

20

What we have here in -- with respect to the automatic stay and

21

with respect to the discharge decisions, is States being bound

22

by Federal law, no different than the States being bound by the

23

minimum wage law, for example.

24

the trustee's attempts to augment the estate by collecting a

25

monetary judgment against the States is an attempt to invade the

But what we have with respect to

barred by sovereign immunity.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Tell me, if you're -- if you're

right -- let's suppose you're right.

5

[Laughter.]

6

MR. THRO:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm over here.

That's --

Sorry, Justice Breyer.
That's all right.

So, it's hard to

8

figure out, because the direction -- you can't tell by the

9

sound.

10

I don't know if there's a modern system that would help

with that, but -- you're right.

11

Suppose that the State -- suppose you're right.

12

What I'd worry about -- and I'd like your response to this -- is

13

that in bankruptcies, or weak firms -- a lot of firms are weak,

14

and they owe a lot of money to the States.

15

figure this out after a while.

16

through, but once they see what they can do, they say, "Here's

17

what we'll do.

So, the States

It takes a few years to seep

Give us

So, they settle it.

A month later, bankrupt.
Now, two things have happened.

The States got 50

22

cents on the dollar, every other creditor gets 5 cents on the

23

dollar, because they were a month ahead of it.

24

that happened is, the creditor -- the firm lost the chance to

25

come in and be rehabilitated.

The second thing

So, the result of this is two bad

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

things: bankruptcy's law's basic purpose, to treat creditors

2

fairly, bankruptcy law's basic purpose, to give firms a chance

3

to rehabilitate, are both seriously undermined.

4

Bankruptcy Clause in the Constitution, how is it possible to say

5

that Congress does not have the power to prevent those two very,

6

very seriously harmful results -- harmful in terms of the basic

7

purpose of the Bankruptcy Clause?

8

MR. THRO:

9

So, given the

Your Honor, the Constitution --

specifically, the eleventh amendment -- confirms that the States

10

are not to be treated like private parties.

11

not immune from contract actions; States are.

12

are not immune from torts -- from tort actions.

13
14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Private parties are
Private parties

But there is not a Tort Clause of

the United States Constitution.

There is not a Contract Clause.

And there is a Bankruptcy Clause.

16

MR. THRO:

There is a Bankruptcy Clause, Your Honor,

17

and that clause empowers Congress to make bankruptcy laws which

18

apply throughout the entire Nation and which apply to the

19

States.

20

Congress to abrogate the State's sovereign immunity from suit.

21

When -- while abrogation can be accomplished using other

22

provisions, it cannot be accomplished using the bankruptcy

23

provision.

24
25

However, the Bankruptcy Clause does not authorize

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Bankruptcy Clause presumably does

not allow Congress to set up the bankruptcy law in such a way

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that it would amount to a taking of property without just

2

compensation, right?

3

violated.

4

constitutional protection of States' sovereign immunity can be

5

taken away by the Bankruptcy Clause; whereas, other provisions

6

clearly can't, right?

7

MR. THRO:

Wouldn't allow another constitution to be

So the only question here is whether the

Yes, Your Honor.

And this Court said, in

8

Seminole Tribe, that the Article 1 powers could not be used to

9

take away, or to abrogate, the States' sovereign immunity.

Now,

10

obviously, section 5 of the fourteenth amendment can be used to

11

do it, but there is no suggestion that Congress used section 5

12

of the fourteenth amendment in enacting its attempt to abrogate

13

sovereign immunity.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But, may I ask, how do you -- how

15

do you reach the conclusion that you're bound by the automatic

16

stay and the discharge?

17

of State sovereignty?

18

MR. THRO:

Why aren't those also an infringement

I think there is a strong argument which

19

can be made that both the automatic stay and the discharge

20

decisions infringe upon State sovereignty.

21

Court's decisions, dating back to at least New York versus

22

Irving Trust in 1933, have made it clear that the States are

23

bound by the provisions of the discharge orders.

24

the automatic stay is something similar to the Ex Parte Young

25

doctrine, in terms of the States being enjoined from doing

However, this

I think, also,

1

something else.

2

However --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To say -- to say that the State

3

can't be sued is not the same thing as saying that the State can

4

sue, is it?

You --

5

MR. THRO:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, it's not, Your Honor.
-- you can prevent the State from

7

suing, even though you can't sue the State.

8

incompatibility, is there?

9
10

MR. THRO:

There's no

No, there's not, Your Honor.

What we

have --

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Now, do you -- do you agree that

12

there are situations where, notwithstanding the sovereign

13

immunity of States, there can be in rem jurisdiction in a court

14

to resolve claims against property --

15

MR. THRO:

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

17

MR. THRO:

Certain --- and bind the State, as well?

Certainly, this Court's decisions

18

indicate that, in some instances, there can be in rem decisions

19

which --

20
21
22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, maybe bankruptcy estates

are one such instance.
MR. THRO:

As this Court noted in Hood, the

23

bankruptcy decisions regarding the discharge are in rem and, of

24

course, are binding upon the State.

25

not an in rem proceeding.

But what we have here is

As this Court noted in Nordic

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Village, an action to recover a preferential transfer claim is

2

not an in rem proceeding.

3

Schoenthal versus Irving Trust in 1932, and Granfinanciera

4

versus Nordberg in 1989, actions to recover preferential

5

transfer are much like actions to recover a contract claim.

6

That is, like a contract claim, they do not involve the core

7

bankruptcy proceedings, but, rather, involve matters that are --

8

or controversies that are tangential to the core bankruptcy

9

proceedings.

10
11

Rather, as this Court noted in

They're nothing more than an attempt to augment

the State.
And where we would draw the line, and where we

12

propose that this Court draws -- draw the line -- and a line

13

that we believe is consistent with this Court's previous

14

decisions -- is that the States are bound by discharge, the

15

States are subject to the automatic stay, but the trustees'

16

attempts to obtain monetary judgments, and thereby augment the

17

value of the estate, are barred by sovereign immunity.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Wouldn't it at least be

19

theoretically possible to differentiate between setting aside a

20

preference, on the one hand, and just bringing a suit for a tort

21

or a breach of contact, on the other?

22

assets that are -- were transferred prematurely -- or hastily,

23

whatever you call it -- as part of the estate.

24

conceptually possible.

25

MR. THRO:

Right.

One could treat the

At least it's

Conceptually, it's possible.

And

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

certainly there is an argument that the bankruptcy code says

2

that preferential transfer is, in fact, property of the State.

3

With respect, however, to a preference to a State, we would say

4

that that particular reading, as applied to the State, is

5

unconstitutional.

6

would require the State to divest money or something to which

7

the State has in its possession in which the State has a

8

colorable claim of ownership.

9

the money is in the State treasury.

I don't believe Congress can make a law which

Here, there is no dispute that
What they are trying to do

10

is to recover a monetary judgment from the State.

11

said in Schoenfeld [sic] and in Granfinanciera, this is very

12

much like a contracts claim.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As this Court

I suppose you could say that a --

14

the intangible of a contract claim is part of the estate, too,

15

right?

16
17
18

It's -MR. THRO:

that.

The current bankruptcy code does not say

In theory, I -JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, I mean, you could be --

19

there's no less reason to say that that's part of the res than

20

there is to say that the preferential transfer is.

21
22

MR. THRO:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And just as

the contract claims are barred, so are the preferential --

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

MR. THRO:

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Except Congress --

-- transfer claims.
-- has drawn that very distinction

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

hadn't it?

2

MR. THRO:

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?
I said Congress has drawn the

4

distinction that -- between the preferential claim and the

5

contract claim.

6

MR. THRO:

Congress has drawn a distinction between

7

preferential transfer claims and contracts claims.

8

this Court has noted that the difference between an action to

9

recover a contract claim in order to augment the estate and an

10

action to recover a preferential transfer in order to augment

11

the estate, that there really is no difference.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

However,

Both are --

But the theory of the second is

13

that you're not augmenting the estate, you're merely preserving

14

the estate, isn't it?

15

MR. THRO:

I think -- Congress has certainly defined

16

the estate so that a preferential transfer is considered

17

property.

18

preferential transfer involves the estate.

19

the effect of Congress, in effect, saying that property which

20

clearly belongs to the State no longer does.

21

probably an affront to tenth amendment federalism concerns.

22

what we do have here is a situation where, like in a breach of

23

contract claim, they are trying to recovery a monetary judgment

24

in order to augment the estate.

25

I'm not sure that Congress can do that when the

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

18

MR. THRO:

That

It is rather odd, Your Honor, but my read

19

of this Court's rules are that there is no mechanism for a

20

Respondent, the party that won below, to, in effect, give up its

21

victory once they get in this Court.

22

they wish to drop the breach of contract claims.

23

feel that by dropping the breach of contract claim, they somehow

obtain a tactical advantage.

this Court should not allow them to rewrite the question

MR. THRO:

That's correct, Your Honor.

In -- this

Court's decisions dealing with what effect happens when a

sovereign, by initiating litigation, certainly exposes itself to

defenses, but does not expose itself to affirmative recoveries.

that had been given to the State, were not a bank transfer, a

sovereign immunity, particularly in the admiralty context, this

14

be in your hypothetical, and, number two, the State has at least

I'm not sure that it has anything to do,

directly, with the theory of sovereign immunity, but
JUSTICE SOUTER:

--

Believe me, I -- I mean, I -- as

19

you know, I'm not a big fan of sovereign immunity in these

20

circumstances, but I'm not quite sure how to get around it,

21

based on the fact that there is no alternative remedy here.

22

MS. LEWIS:

Well, Justice Souter, the thing that I

23

think is very troubling in this case is that there's a very

24

basic bankruptcy policy, and that basic bankruptcy policy on

25

preferences is equality of distribution and to prevent

abusive debt-collection practices on the eve of bankruptcy.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then, basically, you're making the

3

argument from the uniformity phrase -- uniform bankruptcy laws.

4

That's essentially your argument.

5

in this case, that that trumps the sovereign immunity, and that

6

gets you out of Seminole Tribe.

MS. LEWIS:

And you're saying, in the --

I believe that it -- I believe that it

does, Your Honor.

that Virginia Military Institute, on behalf of the Commonwealth

of Virginia, waived its sovereign immunity.

Well, but, of course, that

doesn't hold true for the other agencies, necessarily, unless

14

you think VMI can waive it for all of them.

15

be only a partial argument.

16

MS. LEWIS:

That seems to me to

Justice O'Connor, the -- VMI waived the

17

only sovereign immunity that existed, which was the Commonwealth

18

of Virginia's sovereign immunity.

19

the agencies of the Commonwealth of Virginia served as unitary

20

creditors -- and so, when VMI waived the only sovereign immunity

21

that existed, there was nothing left to waive.

point, the recoveries of the estate -- which were recoveries

23

against other agencies, not only VMI -- were -- the Respondent

is it under 106(b) or 106(c)?

it?

3

MS. LEWIS:

It's beyond both of those, isn't

Chief Justice, it's not under 106(b) or

4

106(c), because the waiver of sovereign immunity -- 106(a)

5

provides that, with respect to preference claims --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's an abrogation, that's

not --

8

MS. LEWIS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That --

10

MS. LEWIS:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- a waiver.

-- that's correct, Your Honor.
Well, my question would be,

12

How can you argue in favor of waiver when you have a statute

13

with a much more limited waiver, the limits in 106(b) and

14

106(c), and you're saying, "Well, they waived it much more

15

broadly"?

16

that there was a waiver under 106(b) or 106(c), but that doesn't

17

get rid of the whole case.

18

It would seem to me that the most you can argue is

MS. LEWIS:

Your Honor, I don't believe that 106(b)

19

or 106(c) limits the waiver in this case, because, again, the

20

sovereign immunity that was waived was the sovereign immunity of

21

the Commonwealth of Virginia.

asserted in that action, the preference actions that are served

against VMI and the other institutions, are preserved, because

106(b) and 106(c), there

So, 106(b) and 106(c) were

And then we looked to the Federal -- this Court's

19

jurisprudence with respect to what constitutes a waiver of

21

Lapides case, in which -- in which a State came into this --

22

removed a case from State to Federal court, and the court said

23

it didn't matter the type of claim that was being asserted, or

24

that there was affirmative recovery that was being asserted,

25

but, in fact, they constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity.

And we would most naturally look at the

28
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

And the State certainly can't say, here, that they

2

didn't know the filing of a proof of claim would constitute a

3

waiver of sovereign immunity, because back in 1947, in the

4

Gardner versus New Jersey case, this Court acknowledged that

5

filing a proof of claim constituted a waiver.

6

And there are ways that a State could avoid this.

7

They could have a process by which they had to go through --

8

whether it be the Attorney General's office, or whomever -- that

9

in order to file a proof of claim, they had to first go

10

somewhere to get authority to do that.

don't know why, in any case, that wouldn't be true.

that are not abrogated under 106(a) of the bankruptcy code.

Okay.

Now, in (b), I guess it's saying that if the

State happens to come in, after he's gone bankrupt, and brought

15

his negligent suit against him, he can respond.

MS. LEWIS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

So, if, in fact, you were to lose

on (a), I guess the whole section would fall, because it

So, then the case

really turns on the extent to which the Government can -- sorry,

they seem to have waived it in (a), whether the Constitution

permits them to do what they did in (a).

MS. LEWIS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right, to abrogate sovereign immunity.
And if you win on that, you win.

5

And if you lose on that, the whole section 106 would probably

fall.

7

MS. LEWIS:

I believe 106 would fall, but, if 106

8

falls, doesn't mean that Respondent would lose, as far as the

waiver argument, because --

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not sure, because if you lose

11

on the whole thing -- suppose you were to say Congress doesn't

have the power to do anything there.

13

(c) would survive, because they may have had something else in

mind.

15

I just wonder if (b) and

But maybe that's too complicated to go into now.
MS. LEWIS:

Well, Justice Breyer, I think that (b)

16

and (c), as pointed out by another one of the Justices, may be a

17

limitation on the general concept of common law waiver.

18

the extent that 106 would be -- this Court were to rule (b) that

would -- unconstitutional, you would look to the general common

law waiver of sovereign immunity, which would be the Gardner

We believe, obviously, Congress had the

right to abrogate sovereign immunity -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

theory, as I read in your brief, as an alternative argument, is

12

that there was a --

The State waived

its immunity by participating through -- in the --

18

How is there an informed waiver if the argument is over the

19

authority to abrogate?

20

MS. LEWIS:

Well, Your Honor, I believe, because

21

this Court has recognized, in Gardner versus New Jersey, that if

22

a State files a proof of claim, it constitutes a waiver, that

23

the State had to have to been informed, it had to know that the

24

actual conduct of filing a proof of claim would have a

25

consequence of a waiver.

That's correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if it turns out that

11

Congress doesn't have that authority, I don't see how you can

12

say the State has made an informed waiver, when their theory is,

13

"Guess what?

14

You don't have that authority to abrogate."

MS. LEWIS:

Well, Your Honor, 106(a) certainly

15

didn't exist back in Gardner versus New Jersey in 1947 either.

16

And I think that the -- the fact that -- if sovereign immunity

17

exists, sovereign immunity can be waived.

I'm not sure --

No, no, no, he's -- so, I'm wrong.

it's unconstitutional for it to do so here, but it could -- it

situation that the State brings a case against the estate, and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you lose on the abrogation

notion, and the Court holds that there is no authority in

Congress to abrogate sovereign immunity, still the bankruptcy

code codifies what is, across the board, the law.

you come to a court and say, "Give me X against D," that D

should be able to come back and say, "Either I want full relief

16

(a).

17

come to court for a claim, you are deemed to have waived any

I can't bring it separately.

I have to bring it

I

So, I don't see why (b) and (c) are not discrete from

(b) and (c) are implementing the idea of a setoff.

MS. LEWIS:

I understand that argument, Justice

Ginsburg, but I believe when Congress enacted 106(a), (b), and

21

(c), that they enacted it -- (a), being those actions which were

22

abrogated, (b) were those actions that remained.

23

actions that remained, there were limitations to that waiver.

24

Because this is not -- there was nothing to waive on sovereign

25

immunity on 106(b) as to preference actions, for example.

And those

Contract claims are different.

Well, it's the same question.

But

5

let's say that the court thinks there might be merit to the

argument of waiver, that the State entity comes in asking to be

treated as a creditor, and its preference is then before the

MR. THRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

The question presented is whether or not Congress

11

may use the Article 1 Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate sovereign

12

immunity.

13

In Alden versus Maine, this Court held that there

14

was a presumption that the States had retained their immunity

15

unless it could be shown by conclusive evidence that the States

16

surrendered their immunity in the plan of convention.

17

Congress can use the Article 1 bankruptcy power to abrogate

18

sovereign immunity, then one would expect there to be

19

discussions to that effect at the constitutional convention, in

20

the federalist and antifederalist writings, and in the ratifying

21

conventions.
