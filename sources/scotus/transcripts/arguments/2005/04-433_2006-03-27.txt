ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

This case concerns use of alleged fraud in

12

the underpayment of taxes as the predicate for a treble

13

damages civil RICO action.

14

concedes that it was not defrauded, but it,

15

nonetheless, claims lost profits when National failed

16

to pay State sales taxes and thereby offered a lower

17

overall price to consumers.

18

Ideal's injury is too indirect as a matter of law under

19

RICO.

20

Respondent Ideal Steel

Our position is that

In reinstating Ideal's RICO claims against

21

National, however, the Second Circuit committed two

22

errors.

23

that credited the plaintiff's allegations of intent

24

instead of applying this Court's test for proximate

25

causation in the Holmes case.

First, it substituted a direct targeting test

And second, the Second

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Circuit permitted Ideal to satisfy the reliance

2

requirement by invoking the State of New York's

3

reliance on the truth of National's allegedly false tax

4

returns.

5

litigation weapon of great destructive force for

6

defendants who will be forced to defend, beyond the

7

pleading stages, damages claims of the most attenuated

8

and indirect character.

9

Both errors transformed civil RICO into a

With respect to our first argument, proximate

10

cause, the court below erred by not applying this

11

Court's test in Holmes and also by failing to take into

12

account the fact that fraud is a statutory violation

13

that -- for which the plaintiff needs to be within the

14

zone of interest.

15

the defrauded party, it is not within the zone of

16

interest protected by the fraud statute.

Quite simply, because Ideal was not

17

With respect to the Holmes factors, for three

18

reasons the -- Ideal Steel is unable to plead proximate

19

cause.

20

First, in Holmes, this Court made clear that

21

where there's an indirect plaintiff, the claims are

22

difficult to prove in terms of ascertaining what the

23

level of damages is.

24

case because of the highly attenuated chain of

25

causation that allege -- that Ideal alleges as a

20

Souter, and here's why.

decision -- in -- in the Court's decision.

that customers that owned the shares in those firms

2

would also suffer direct harm.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure, but they suffered the

4

harm because the firm suffered the harm.

5

there was -- there's a word there.

6

7

you will, between them and -- and the -- and the

8

offending RICO party.

in between the two of them.

10

There was --

There was -- there

Here, there's -- there's nobody

MR. FREDERICK:

That -- that's not so.

There

11

is, and New York is in between them in this respect.

12

If -- Ideal is asserting that because the taxes had not

13

been charged and then paid to the State of New York,

14

that National gained a competitive advantage.

15

think the Court has been clear that the competitive

16

harms -- and this was true in the Associated General

17

Contracting case in which the Court in Holmes relied

18

directly -- is not going to be sufficient when there

19

are multiple steps in the chain.

20

But I

Here, as a factual matter, Justice Souter,

21

they have to be able to link every individual sale for

22

which there was not a tax paid, assert that that person

23

was wrongfully not charged a tax.

under certain circumstances, if a contractor has a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And then they have

Well, why -- why is that

5

true?

6

there was a purpose and an intent to adopt this -- this

7

tax evasion scheme and that the whole object was to

8

undermine and -- and injure the competitor, and they

9

show that this scheme began to work and that their

Let's assume that they could establish that

10

reputation as a lower-cost competitor was -- was well

11

established.

12

Why -- why isn't that enough?

MR. FREDERICK:

Because this Court rejected a

13

similar theory in section 4 of the Clayton Act context

14

where it held that a specific intent to injure is not

15

sufficient as a pleading matter.

16

case held that where an association had a -- an -- a

17

specific intent to harm the unions, that that was not

18

sufficient for invoking section 4 of the Clayton Act.

19

The same analysis applies here because what

The Court in that

20

Ideal is attempting to do is to use artful pleading as

21

a way to get around the proximate cause requirement

22

through their simple assertions that there are no, in

23

fact, other competitors within a three-State area and

24

that National was targeting them for competitive harm.

25

They're attempting to evade the normal requirements

for proximate cause that look to whether or not the

2

direct injury is suffered by the plaintiff.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Frederick, you -- you

4

started by saying how difficult this would be to prove,

5

but could the plaintiff piggyback on New York?

6

York was the defrauded party and taxes are owed to the

7

State, has the State had no proceeding in this?

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

If New

Well, as the briefs indicate

-- and we're somewhat outside the record.

As the case

10

comes to this Court, it's on the pleadings.

11

footnotes in the brief give a little bit of a flavor of

12

what has happened since then, and there are audit

13

proceedings that the State of New York has commenced.

14

It has not commenced any kind of civil or criminal

15

proceeding against National, nor has it brought a RICO

16

action against National.

17

with the State at the level of the auditors as to

18

whether or not any back tax is owed and, if so, in what

19

amount.

20

But the

But there are discussions

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do I understand correctly

21

that the complaint has since been amended to assert a

22

Federal income tax shortfalls?

23

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct, Justice

24

Ginsburg.

25

there are in excess of 500,000 corporate income tax

theory, each of those would be a predicate act for a

RICO case, asserting treble damages where one

competitor could use the in terrorem effect of a RICO

claim simply because of an underpayment of tax notice.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

more focused than that, I think.

There's only one

competitor here, isn't there?
MR. FREDERICK:

We have to assume that for

12

purposes of this pleading except insofar as it

13

acknowledges whether or not a legal requirement is

14

satisfied, and I think that the cases of this Court and

15

certainly the commentators have been clear the Court

16

does not need to assume a fact for purposes of a legal

17

conclusion.

18

has not been borne out by discovery, and there are, in

19

fact, multiple competitors.

20

As the -- as the footnotes indicate, that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But do you think it's fair

21

to interpret the Second Circuit as having, in effect,

22

held that every competitor of anybody who cheats on his

23

taxes has a RICO claim?

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

What the Second Circuit held

was that if the plaintiff pleads that they were a

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

direct target -- and here, other competitors in the

2

market like Colonial, Alimar, Friedel, and Easton

3

Steel, could plead exactly the same thing that they, in

4

fact, were the direct target.

5

Circuit's test, that would be sufficient to override a

6

motion to dismiss and proceed the parties into

7

protracted discovery.

8

General Contracting and in Holmes made clear was that

9

the courts were not designed to be the forums for this

10

kind of long, arduous fact-finding mission in order to

11

determine whether or not indirect injuries should be

12

compensable with treble damages under the RICO statute.

13

Mr. Frederick, I

understand how your arguments work under section

seems that that gets around many of the causation and

17

reliance arguments that you make.

18

MR. FREDERICK:

It

Mr. Chief Justice, the way we

19

get to the proximate cause requirement through Holmes

is through 1964(c)'s use of by reason of a violation of

MR. FREDERICK:

This would be -- it's kind of strange.
It has penalties for

10

held, and I think this Court's decision in Pasquantino,

11

which holds that the tax revenue from a governmental

12

entity can be property within the meaning of the fraud

13

statutes, would support a general notion that a State

14

could, in fact, if it believed that that was necessary

15

to vindicate the law's purposes would be appropriate.

16

Of course, here, the State of New York has got to get

17

to that level through a very long series of steps, and

18

it hasn't even approached, you know, the initial steps

19

in terms of even bringing civil claims against

20

National.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the Second Circuit

think that it should be foreclosed that as your opinion

in Holmes and as footnote 20 of the majority opinion in

Holmes pointed out, how those proximate cause factors

4

get analyzed with the different predicate acts may vary

5

slightly, but we think --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, may -- may I ask you

7

to focus this way, just going one step further than the

8

hypo you've got?

9

defendant engages in extortion against A and makes a

lower price simply because he's getting all this income

from the extortion.

15

analysis be the same as your analysis in this case?

16

As a result of that, in -- in

In that case, wouldn't your

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, it would because there

17

is a better defendant A which got extorted for purpose

18

of vindicating the extortion --

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- but if that's the

20

case, then -- if -- if the relationship between the

parties is the same, then the presence of violence or

nonviolence has nothing to do with your -- your

position.

24
25

Does it?
MR. FREDERICK:

It -- it does in this extent.

I can't think of a hypothetical, off the top of my

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

head or after some consideration, of where the violence

would have been such that there would have been a less

indirect injury than the one in your hypothetical,

4

Justice Souter.

5

possibility, as this Court did not foreclose in

6

footnote 20 of the Holmes opinion, that there could be

7

such a case.

8

because the mail and wire fraud predicate acts are very

9

close to the securities fraud that this Court

10
11

But I would not want to foreclose the

It's not necessary for us to prevail here

considered in the Holmes case.
I would acknowledge that in the extortion and

12

robbery and other carjacking and violence type acts,

13

there could be congressional policies that would be

14

taken into account.

15

history of RICO points to a concern that persons would

16

be using violence in a way that would cause harms.

17

I don't think the Court needs to go there in order to

18

rule in our favor in this case.

19

And certainly the legislative

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this?

But

I assume

20

you would agree that if the defendant had -- had hired

21

a thug to go out and beat up his competitor, the

22

competitor would have a cause of action.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

Yes.
And what if the defendant

bribed a -- an official of the New York revenue

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

department to impose unnecessarily high taxes on the

2

competitor?

3

MR. FREDERICK:

That is starting to get more

4

indirect, but I think that that probably would be

5

sufficient to show injury because the State of New York

6

is not suffering any kind of property loss or any other

7

kind of harm other than honest services.

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what if they -- what if

they somehow or other fraudulently persuaded the

10

revenue agents of the State to impose higher taxes and

11

penalties on the competitor?

12

MR. FREDERICK:

I -- I don't think that that

13

hypothetical in any substantive way is different from

14

the second one, Justice Stevens.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

MR. FREDERICK:

So you think there would be

No.

I -- I think -- I think

18

that the -- the question of how government behaves, for

19

purposes of its discharge of public responsibilities,

20

you know, is treated through a lens that goes to

21

whether or not the law can be properly vindicated

22

there.

2

cause all sorts of nuisance values and so forth.

3

he's a State official, induced to do that by some kind

4

of bribery or fraud on the part of the defendant.

5

Would there be a cause of action there or not?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

But

Not under -- well, I don't

7

think there would be a cause of action by the

8

competitor under RICO because, again, those damages are

9

too indirect.

That's not very different from the

10

Associated General Contracting case where there were --

11

answers because I was thinking you want to draw a

16

rather clear line between where fraud is at issue, and

17

The difficulty, Justice

10

Breyer, as -- as that series of hypotheticals plays out

11

in the real world is that defendants who have to defend

12

against actions are forced to deal with the truth of

13

pleadings for purposes of 12(b)(6).

14

this case, where the plaintiff can, through artful

15

pleading, you know, navigate through these series of

16

proximate cause issues, can plead facts that courts

that the rule as articulated is one that would have

some administration issues.

I think it is certainly an

10

easier case where there is a broad-spread competitive

11

harm as a result of a lowering of a particular

12

competitor's costs or a particular defendant's costs

13

and one where there is a fraud that is specifically

14

directed at a piece of property for which --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. FREDERICK:

17
18

But it's not --

-- the plaintiff asserts a

claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think the reason

19

Justice Breyer's test is a little more administrable

20

than you're willing to admit is that it's not a

21

question of motive.

You're not asking why they did it.

22

You're asking where the predicate act is directed, and

23

if the predicate act is directed to lowering the -- the

24

firm's taxes so that it can compete more aggressively,

25

that's one thing.

If the -- the predicate act is

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

directed to, you know, blowing up the other firm's

2

warehouse or -- or, you know, something like that, it's

3

a different matter altogether.

4

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

5

Justice.

6

easier to ascertain because you know where the damages

7

are.

8

damages among multiple plaintiffs, and there may not be

9

a better plaintiff.

But under the Holmes test, that becomes much

You don't have to worry about apportioning

So I think if you applied the

10

Holmes factors in this test here and to the example

11

that you gave, the answer is a fairly straightforward

12

one.

13

If I could turn to the second point of

14

proximate cause that we have raised, it's that as a

15

matter of zone of interest standing, because Ideal is

16

not the defrauded party, they fall outside the zone of

17

interests protected by the fraud statutes.

18

well accepted at common law and through this Court's

19

incorporation of common law principles as a means of

20

interpreting the RICO statute, that the predicate act

should be viewed in terms of who is designed to be

protected.

MR. RODDY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Ideal Steel asks this Court to affirm the

reasons.

2

First, the Second Circuit's decision in this

3

case is consistent with this Court's decisions in

4

Sedima in 1985 and National Organization for Women in

5

1994.

6

Second, the Second Circuit's decision is

7

entirely consistent with this Court's decision in

8

Holmes in 1992.

9

Third, we submit that reliance is not an

10

element of a civil RICO claim based on predicate acts

11

of mail and wire fraud.

12

But fourth, if reliance is an element, then

13

we agree with the Solicitor General that reliance by a

14

third party not only suffices under RICO, but sufficed

15

at common law.

16

The decision should be affirmed.

That should be the end of the matter.

We agree with the

Here, we have that

Being -- is there any

other case where the defendant is charged with not

paying tax either to the Federal Government or the

State?

Now you have it both because you --

18

MR. RODDY:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
-- you said they haven't

20

paid tax for this -- their income -- Federal income tax

21

either. This seems to be a novel claim, and I don't

22

know of another where failure to pay tax owed to a

23

State or the Federal Government is the basis for a RICO

24

claim.

MR. RODDY:

Justice Ginsburg, as you

correctly pointed out, Ideal's second amended

2

complaint, which is not before this Court in this

3

proceeding, alleged an income tax scheme.

4

Judge Berman in the Southern District of New York

5

permitted that amendment.

6

And -- and

I am not aware of another case involving a

7

competitor bringing a claim on these set of facts.

8

However, as we pointed out in our brief on the merits,

9

there is a discrete set of RICO cases involving

10

competitors as plaintiffs who either allege

11

misrepresentations to third parties, whether customers

12

or government agencies, bribes, or violence and threats

13

of violence.

14

I submit to you that this Court's decision in

15

National Organization for Women in 1994 presents a

16

variation on the theme.

17

case the anti-abortion protestors, the defendants,

18

engaged in violence or threats of violence directed at

19

customers, and the injury was to the health care

20

clinics, the plaintiffs.

That's true here also.

standing and RICO standing, meaning injury plus

If you accept the fact that there are two

say, under the Holmes direct analysis, that so far as

the fraud on New York, which is the RICO violation, the

15

consequence is an indirect one, the consequence to your

client, but so far as the price competition is

concerned, the consequence is a direct one, but price

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
-- the fraud gives

13

him a competitive advantage not just over the, you know

14

-- his -- his brother-in-law's company that he's trying

15

to get at, but over everybody who's in the business.

16

MR. RODDY:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

In that factual scenario, yes.
I mean, if that's so, then

18

go back for a minute, please, to Justice Souter's

19

question.

20

certainly if violence is involved or a direct action

21

against an employee or the competitor himself, then

22

I'll assume you'd win.

23

It doesn't concern violence.

I'm --

But the line I think that he drew very

24

clearly and I think Justice Stevens picked up on, as I

25

heard it, is a -- a fraud where the person defrauded is

2

to lower the cost of the person who is doing the fraud.

Now, if that's so, you either draw Justice

4

Souter's line or you don't.

5

Souter's line, then you stay out of the thicket.

6

you don't, you'll have all the problems that were

mentioned, that there is no way to distinguish between

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Roddy, I thought that

8

the way you got out of this problem was what your

9

opponent has called careful pleading.

I thought that

10

-- that what you were saying was that your client was

11

targeted, that other competitors were not targeted,

12

that this is something of a family -- both of these

13

companies are owned by the same family and there's some

14

bad blood.

15

this?

It's not our position.
I thought it was part of

your complaint that -- that the business here was going

22

after your client in particular.

MR. RODDY:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, that is correct.

have been hurt, but -- but the whole purpose of it was

raised the family feud.

That's not what this case is about.

point.

in a law, particularly in an economic context --

The point is I don't see how it's administrable

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- where people who are

11

interested in making money are prepared to say, look,

12

we want to make the money.

between they'd like to get rid of all of them.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I frankly

Or, in -- in other words,

your -- your targeted argument doesn't really make

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:

I'd like to return to Justice

4

Souter's hypothetical because I think that the point of

5

price competition fits squarely within the Holmes case.

6

If you were to take the fact of bankruptcy, the mere

7

going bankrupt of the brokers in that case, the -- the

8

effect of that on the customers who are attempting to

9

bootstrap in the securities fraud fits perfectly here

10

because the fraud here against the State of New York

11

enables National allegedly to engage in price

12

competition.

13

But as you pointed out in your hypothetical,

14

price competition is not a RICO violation.

12

hypotheticals about how many competitors would be able

and the cigarette hypothetical all point to the fact

that, at bottom, their theory is that any action on the

part of a defendant that leads to an indirect ability

17

to engage in price competition would give rise to a

18

RICO claim.

19

there are literally millions -- just on taxes alone,
