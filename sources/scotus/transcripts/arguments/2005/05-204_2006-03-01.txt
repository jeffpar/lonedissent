ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-276

9

MR. SMITH:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Texas legislature passed a new

12

congressional districting map in 2003 for only one

13

reason:

14

represent the State of Texas in Congress.

15

the existing lawful map already had 20 of 32 districts

16

which strongly favored the Republicans, lawmakers went

17

to extraordinary lengths to lock in control of 22

18

districts, moving around 8 million people into new

19

districts, abandoning concerns about compactness,

20

wherever necessary, and most importantly, segregating

21

the population by race and by politics into 32

22

districts which are extremely noncompetitive.

23

maximizing the number of Republicans who would

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even though

So your -- your

24

statement that it was for one reason only means it

25

wasn't for any discriminatory reason on the grounds of

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

race or ethnicity?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, the finding of the

3

district court, which we're relying on here, was that

4

it was purely for discrimination based on partisanship

5

rather than on the basis of race.

6

Now, they started out by trying to engineer

7

the defeat in the -- in the legislative process,

8

engineer the defeat of the six Democratic Congressmen

9

who had managed to be elected in Republican-leaning

10

districts because they were moderate to conservative

11

and they were, as the district court put it, able to

12

appeal to voters to split their tickets and vote for

13

them in 2002.

14

By the end of the legislative process, they

15

went further and decided to take the risk of

16

eliminating one of only four districts in the State in

17

which African Americans had an opportunity to elect

18

candidates of their choice and also to eliminate one of

19

the Hispanic opportunity districts in south Texas.

20

Now, in the latter case, they did try to replace that

21

with another Hispanic opportunity district, but that

22

was the one that we've called the land bridge district,

23

District 25, which spans 300 miles, linking up urban

24

concentrations of Latinos in Austin and in McAllen down

25

on the Mexican border.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. SMITH:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

You think that's no good.

Your Honor, we -Not -- not even to prevent

retrogression, which would violate section 5.

5

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, the retrogression

6

problem was created by the fact that they had gotten

7

rid of a much more natural -- naturally occurring --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that was done for

political reasons, not racial reasons.

10

MR. SMITH:

Exactly, Your Honor, and that's

11

the argument that was made and rejected expressly by

12

this Court in Bush v. Vera, that we had to make an ugly

13

minority district rather than a compact minority

14

district because if we did it the other way, a nearby

15

incumbent would lose his seat.

16

argument that was made there, that it was really

17

incumbency protection, and we had to make it this ugly

18

district to send that excessive racial message in order

19

to protect other nearby incumbents, an argument which

20

is mirrored here exactly and -- and as to which I

21

notice the -- the State of Texas offers no response.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That was precisely the

But what -- what is your

23

proposal?

24

-- assuming there is a political motivation in drawing

25

its districts, perfectly valid political motivation

What -- what is -- what is a State to do if

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

let's assume, and the result of that redrawing is that

2

it would eliminate a majority minority district, what

3

-- what is the State supposed to do?

4

MR. SMITH:

I think the State has to stay

5

within the constitutional confines of the Shaw v. Reno

6

doctrine which would require it not to go so far in the

7

pursuit of its political agenda that it creates a

8

district -- has to -- has to create a minority

9

opportunity district somewhere that would otherwise

10

violate Shaw.

11

Now --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what's the -- I'm -- as

13

Justice Scalia, I'm interested in the section 25

14

problem.

The briefs --

15

MR. SMITH:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

District.
-- for your co-counsel

17

don't talk much about it, and it's -- it's a problem

18

for me.

19

Justice Scalia's point was let's assume --

20

and I have some doubt about it.

21

there's a valid reason for redoing section 23.

22

means you need another district to avoid retrogression.

23

What is -- what is your position as to district 25 on

24
25

Let's assume that
That

that assumption, based on that assumption?
MR. SMITH:

I don't think that it makes a

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

constitutional difference under this Court's cases

2

whether or not the reason they decided to place the

3

district there and give it that configuration was

4

because they had a political agenda somewhere else.

5

The -- the fact of the matter is they -- they were

6

deliberately trying to create an Hispanic majority

7

district there, and to do it, they had to go all the

8

way up to Austin and grab 300,000 Latinos and link them

9

up with --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Surely, that's not what

11

makes it bad.

12

but with the -- with the intent of creating a majority

13

minority district, that would be a district created for

14

a racial reason.

15

to be not compact doesn't eliminate the motivation, and

16

-- and I don't see how you can avoid that motivation

17

unless you're going to abandon the -- the prohibition

18

against regression.

19

Even if they created a compact district

The mere fact that this one happens

MR. SMITH:

Our point, Your Honor, is that in

20

this situation, doing it this way, the -- the

21

motivation predominates over the other legitimate

22

districting criteria, which I think under Bush and

23

under --

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Which -- which

motivation?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

MR. SMITH:

2

motivation to create a district -- to -- to reach out

3

as far as they did to capture --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, can the -- can the

5

State by its action with one district, i.e., 23, in

effect bootstrap itself in a position where it's

7

entitled to use race where -- in a -- in a predominant

8

and I -- I think insulting way and -- and then have a

9

defense?

10
11

MR. SMITH:
cannot, Your Honor.

12
13

Now, if I could turn to the partisanship
issue, our --

14
15

Our submission is that they

JUSTICE BREYER:

May I just clarify one thing

on that?

16

MR. SMITH:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sure.
I take it your reason was

18

that in Bush v. Vera, the Court said, of course, they

19

can use race to prevent retrogression.

20

can, but if they do, they have to create a compact

21

majority minority district, not an elongated majority

22

--

23

MR. SMITH:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

argument.

Of course, they

Yes.
That's the -- that's the

I have to go back and look at Bush v. Vera.

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, and that they

2

can't say we have to create it in a non-compact way

3

where the race predominates over the other values

4

because we have a political agenda of protecting some

5

other incumbent in a non-minority district.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How -- how does that

7

make any sense to say that what you're objecting to is

8

the consideration of race in one situation, but if it's

9

compact and the predominant motive was the

10

consideration of race, that doesn't bother you?

11

seems to me to be a back-door way to get into a more

12

extensive judicial review of the compactness and based

13

on racial considerations that are, under your view, the

14

predominant factor in each case.

15

MR. SMITH:

That

Well, Your Honor, I think there's

16

a question of what you mean by the word predominance.

17

And I as understand the Court's cases, there are times

18

when the shape and the extra efforts that are made to

19

-- to kind of gather up minority voters as, for

20

example, in Miller v. Johnson where we had a very

21

similar district, where race is said to predominate in

22

a different sense than it does when you simply are

23

creating a minority district to avoid retrogression or

24

to -- to stay in compliance with the Voting Rights Act.

25

Clearly, the Voting Rights Act requires you

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to create minority districts.

2

it makes sense that people make efforts to do that.

3

We're not saying you shouldn't do any of those things.

4

It should require that

We're just saying in this instance, under this Court's

5

cases, you shouldn't be able to use your political

6

agenda to allow you and justify you to do it in a

7

different way which sends this extra message of

8

excessive racial consideration.

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you can take race

11

into account if it's compact as a predominant motive.

12

You can't take race into account if it's not compact.

13
14

MR. SMITH:

I think, Your Honor, you

certainly can --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. SMITH:

As a dominant motive.

You certainly can intentionally

17

create a minority district under section 2 of the

18

Voting Rights Act.

19

with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act if you don't do

20

that in situations where, under the Gingles criteria,

21

that's what you're supposed to do.

22

I don't know how you could comply

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask?

I'm a little

23

puzzled by the -- the questioning.

24

agree that the predominant motive in all the districts

25

was political?

Doesn't everyone

You agree to that, don't you?

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SMITH:

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, Your Honor.
And you don't agree that

3

that necessarily makes it valid, that that's

4

necessarily a defense to section 2.

5
6
7

MR. SMITH:

No, I actually don't agree with

that, Your Honor, and you're right.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

And -- and the problem with

8

section -- with district 23, under section 2 of the

9

Voting Rights Act, is not the motivation.

10

results that have changed.

11

MR. SMITH:

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's the

Isn't that correct?

That's correct, Your Honor.
And the question under the

13

district court's opinion is whether the political

14

motive was an adequate defense to what would otherwise

15

be a violation of section 2.

Is that correct?

16

MR. SMITH:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Well, isn't it

18

correct, though, that a result is -- focus on results

19

is not sufficient if the challenge is an equal

20

protection one and not a section 2 one?

21
22
23
24
25

MR. SMITH:

Right, but -- but our challenge

under the Equal Protection Clause -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm talking about

district 25.
MR. SMITH:

It's a little hard to keep all

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the different arguments straight, but yes.

2

argument is based on intent there, yes, Your Honor.

3

And -- and the argument is that the intent went too far

4

because they had to --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Our

Well, that's why I

6

asked earlier that your -- your statement that all of

7

this was done with a political motive -- I wondered how

8

that satisfied the equal protection requirement, not

9

the section 2 requirement.

10

MR. SMITH:

Well, I think there are

11

situations in which you have a political motive

12

overarching the entire map, and that -- but at the same

13

time, that pushes you to do some things which could

14

violate the Fourteenth Amendment in terms of racial

15

conduct.

16

argument is --

17

And that's what this -- that's what our

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you don't think that's

18

a defense.

19

problem that it claims that it must use race to settle.

20
21
22

It seems to me the State creates the very

MR. SMITH:

That's correct, Your Honor, yes.

We don't think it's a defense in this instance.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, with respect to section

23

2, what is -- what is your position on the relationship

24

between the predominant political motivation and the

25

existence and nonexistence of a section 2 violation?

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, if I understand the

2

question, I -- if the question is is it permissible to

3

have --

4
5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If -- let me put it another

way.

6

MR. SMITH:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.
If -- if you otherwise

8

demonstrate a section 2 violation, is the political

9

motivation a defense?

10

MR. SMITH:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR. SMITH:

13

Now, we have a -- an argument about that too,

No, Your Honor.
No.

Certainly not.

14

which has to do with the district in the Dallas-Fort

15

Worth area, and I think the political defense there

16

doesn't have anything to do with it.

17

Now, if -- if I could, I think that the whole

18

map -- the decision to redraw the whole map violates

19

the Equal Protection Clause for a wholly different

20

reason, which was that it was wholly lacking in any

21

rational, legitimate public purpose.

22

there was a lawful map in place that had the right

23

number of districts, and the district court found as

24

fact that the only reason that this law was even

25

considered, let alone passed, was to help one political

Wow.

That's a surprise.

What about having a -- a

7

plan that was put in place by the legislature instead

8

of a temporary plan put in effect by a court?

9
10

MR. SMITH:

The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't there -- isn't it --

11

you -- you seem to treat this as a redone redistricting

12

instead of as the very first redistricting done by a

13

legislature.

14

MR. SMITH:

It was the first one done by the

15

legislature because they violated the Constitution

16

intentionally when they had an obligation to -- to draw

17

a map 2 years earlier.

18

existence of some power that the legislature may have

19

to -- to alter the remedial map -- and they may well

20

have that power.

21

doesn't justify the map.

22

exercising that power, point to some constitutional

23

basis for which they're acting.

24
25

Our submission is that the

We don't -- we don't question that --

political reasons.

know, something horrible is ridiculous.

acknowledge that political motivation is fine.

Legislatures redraw the maps all the time for

7

MR. SMITH:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. SMITH:

You

Your Honor, we -Don't you?

-- we acknowledge that we

10

tolerate political motivation in the context of map-

11

drawing when there's other legitimate public purposes

12

being served, which is to say at the beginning of the

13

decade when they have to redraw the map anyway.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. SMITH:

I see.

But our position is when it's

16

purely for partisan motivation, which is -- only occurs

17

in mid-decade --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even -- even when the map is

19

so distorted -- you -- you acknowledge that the map that came

20

out, after this -- this realignment of districts, had

21

less of a divergence between the voting strength of the

22

Republican Party and the number of Republican seats

23

than had existed under the previous allocation by the

24

Democrats.

25

MR. SMITH:

That -- that is not, we believe,

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a justification for two reasons, Your Honor.

2

notion that you can have compensatory gerrymandering

3

and that that can be your justification -- I think it's

4

wrong as a matter of law because all it amounts to is

5

another way of saying we like -- we don't like the

6

partisan composition of the delegation that the people

7

voted for and we're going to change it.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm saying less.

This

Less.

It -- there's less of a divergence under the new map

10

than there was under the old one.

11

is this divergence is in favor of the majority.

12

MR. SMITH:

The only difference

Well, Your Honor, as the district

13

court found -- and this is on page 85 of our

14

jurisdictional statement appendix -- it wasn't that

15

there was bias in the map that the court drew.

16

that there were 20 of 32 districts that strongly

17

favored the Republicans in the court-drawn map.

18

just so happened that the voters in those districts, in

19

six of those Republican-leaning districts, happened to

20

like voting for moderate to conservative Democrats who

21

they were comfortable with.

22

-- I find difficulty -- I find it difficult to

23

understand how anyone could say the legislature can, as

24

a matter of -- use the machinery of government to

25

decide that those voters should not have that

It was

It

Now, if you tell me -- I

opportunity to do that again, that that was a mistake.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, counsel, just

3

take it in -- in an abstract way.

4

the prior system has been gerrymandered by the party in

5

power, are you saying that when that shift in power in

6

the statewide offices changes, that the new party in

7

power cannot redress the gerrymandering of its

8

predecessor?

9

MR. SMITH:

If you think that

My -- my answers to that are

10

twofold.

11

should hold that -- if that's the only justification,

12

you ought to wait until you have other public purposes

for redrawing the lines.

14

I think as a matter of law that the Court

But even if that were -- even if the Court is

15

going to allow that kind of justification for mid-decade

16

redistricting, it shouldn't allow it here because it

17

was just factually untrue, as the district court found.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but let's get back to

19

the -- to the principle without just talking about

20

these -- these factfindings.

21

very odd for you to be telling us that partisan

22

gerrymandering is -- is improper when that's the sole

23

or substantial, predominant motivation, but then saying

24

that we can't correct it when it's happened.

25

It -- it seems to me

Let's assume that the 1990 legislative plan

18
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

was one that was done with -- without a wholly partisan

2

intent, but over the years, it -- it now freezes in the

3

Democrats or party X to having a much greater advantage

4

than the general registration would give it.

5

leaves it in for a particularly partisan purpose, why

6

-- why can't it be redone?

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, I think that if

the Court --

And if it

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I just don't understand

that argument.

11

MR. SMITH:

I think it's a dangerous thing to

12

do, to say to the legislatures of the country you can't

13

redistrict for partisan gain, but if you can recouch it

14

as partisan compensation, that's okay.

Let me give you

another parallel.

Can you take race into account in drawing

I think if a map is illegal, Your

21

Honor, then -- then certainly it is within the power of

22

-- of the legislature to --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, well, that's -- but now,

24

in fairness, I think to the red brief argument --

25

you've read the red briefs.

MR. SMITH:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I have, Your Honor.
Yes.

They are filled with

3

factual information that in their opinion shows that

4

previously the Democrats had gerrymandered this much

5

worse, and that what -- this was an effort to create a

6

balance.

7

know really precisely what is your response to that

8

argument.

9

That's what their view is.

MR. SMITH:

Now, I want to

My response is -- is -- factual

10

response is that by the time we got to 2002, the

11

district court's drawn map had 20 of 32 districts,

12

which voted overwhelmingly Republican for every other

13

office, in the range of 60 to 70 percent, so that

14

whatever bias was introduced into the map in 1991, if

15

there was one, had been eradicated because all of these

16

Democrats in those districts had become more

17

Republican.

18

nothing wrong with the lines.

19
20
21

And so the map was not biased.

JUSTICE BREYER:

There was

Now, what do I look to in

the record to verify what you just said?
MR. SMITH:

You look to the court's finding

22

on page 85 which said that 20 of 32 districts favored

23

the Republicans.

24

filed by both sides at the trial that preceded that

25

finding, and the experts for both sides said that the

And you look at the expert reports

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

court-drawn map was a pro-Republican map that favored

2

the Republicans or, at minimum, was fair, and that with

3

the kind of voting patterns that existed in Texas at

4

the time, one would expect the Republicans to carry 20

5

districts in most of the elections.

6

Now, they also said -- and -- and this is a

7

reason why the State didn't actually put their expert

8

on the stand -- that the map that the legislature had

9

drawn instead was wildly biased in favor of the

10

Republicans in that at 52 percent of the vote, they

11

would still get 22 districts, and at 50 percent of the

12

vote, they'd still get 20 districts.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but what percentage did

14

they have?

15

should have gotten 20 districts, and how many districts

16

did the plan give them?

17

I -- I thought that -- you say that they

MR. SMITH:

The plan gave them 20 districts

18

in which they had a strong Republican majority.

19

what that means is that --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now,

But you say that's what they

21

should have had, given -- given the voting in the

22

State.

23

MR. SMITH:

I say they -- that given that

24

opportunity to have 20 districts elect Congressmen,

25

that's -- that's all that anybody could reasonably ask

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

for.

2

even imagine justifying purely partisan redistricting

3

in mid-decade.

That's the only kind of justification that I can

4

The fact of the matter is the large majority

5

of the Members of Congress who went to Washington after

6

the 2002 election were elected by Republicans in

7

Republican districts.

8

they say, well, vestiges of the past gerrymander are

9

still around, but what does that mean?

That's what the facts are.

Now,

The fact is the

10

districts are by now overwhelmingly Republican in the

11

large majority of cases.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have any -- any

13

authority either in the text of the Constitution or in

14

a -- a case for the proposition that the only reason a

15

legislature can reapportion its districts is because

16

there's been a census?

17
18
19

MR. SMITH:

Our -- our position is slightly

different.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but that's your

20

position when you said mid-decade redistricting is bad

21

because your -- your position is the only reason is the

22

census is -- has -- has caused there to be less than --

23

than one man/one vote.

24
25

MR. SMITH:

There may be cases where you

could do mid-decade redistricting for neutral,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

legitimate public purposes.

2

rare in -- in practice, but there certainly could be.

3

I submit they'll be quite

Our position is you can't redraw the lines

4

purely for partisan gain, and the case I would point to

5

that I think most strongly speaks to that is Cox v.

6

Larios.

7

population deviations, sufficiently small that they

8

weren't even usually requiring justifications, didn't

9

pass the rational basis test because the only

In that case, the district court found that

10

explanation you could offer for those deviations was

11

that they were systematically attempting to help the

12

Democrats at the expense of the Republicans.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but are you saying -Well, if you say that mid-

15

decennial districting is suspect or subject to some

16

special rules, then it seems to me that you're --

17

you're taking away a very important deterrent that

18

works on legislatures when they do decennial

19

districting.

20

a decennial districting, that your program is going to

21

be presumptively valid or not subject to partisan

22

gerrymandering, then -- then you're -- then you're

23

liable to overreach.

24

dangerous for this Court to take away that control

25

mechanism that exists so that legislatures know that

If you know as a legislature, when you do

And it -- it seems to me very

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there's a possibility that if they overreach, they can

2

be corrected.

3

MR. SMITH:

That -- that might be a concern,

4

Your Honor.

5

practice supports it because the fact is that while

6

there's been a fair amount of partisan redistricting,

7

whatever one wants to call it, in the last several

8

decades, there have been precious few, if any, examples

9

of anybody trying to convene the legislature before the

I don't think the -- the historical

10

next census to try to fix it.

11

rare.

12

tradition we've established in this country that

13

whatever happens when those lines get drawn, even if

14

it's done by a court, you leave it alone until the next

15

time --

It is extraordinarily

And the reason for it is we -- there's a general

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, there was no --

That -- that little -- even

18

if it's done by the court.

19

that in.

20

you cannot redistrict except after a decennial census,

21

surely there ought to be an exception unless -- which

22

-- which would read, unless the districting you're

23

living under was never decreed by the legislature, but

24

was decreed by a court.

25

here.

I like the way you slipped

I mean, even if you had a general rule that

And that was the situation

Surely, that's a good reason, even if you

1
2

adopted your general proposition.
MR. SMITH:

The -- the reason I -- I slipped

3

it in is that in my description of what I think is the

4

current tradition, Your Honor, is we went and looked

5

and found how many court-drawn congressional district

6

maps have there been in this country in the last 40

7

years, and how many times were they redrawn by the

8

legislature.

9

between 1970 and 2000, there were 36 of them, and only

And the answer is that if you go back

10

two of them were redrawn in very small, technical ways,

11

one in Hawaii where they only have two districts and

12

then the one in Texas, which was changed in Dallas.

13

It's not --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I'd say that's a shame

15

for the democratic process.

16

that -- that there are a lot of districts out there

17

that have never been drawn by the people, which is what

18

the Constitution envisions.

19

MR. SMITH:

I -- I don't like the idea

Well, Your Honor, the other thing

20

I think about this -- this argument about that we have

21

this -- this need to have a legislative plan is you

22

invite an abuse of a different kind.

23

say to the legislature, you can sit on your hands at

24

the time when you have an undisputed constitutional

25

obligation to redraw the lines at the beginning of --

If you -- if you

of the decade, as long -- and you'll know that what

2

that will do is it will give you the right to come

3

along anytime you feel like it when you get your

4

political ducks --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that the reason

these lines were not redrawn at the beginning of the

7

decade, because the majority party sat on its hands?

That's absolutely what happened

They didn't make any serious efforts

of the whole legislature, we were calling special

2

sessions like mad to get the job done.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So --

But the court -- even from

4

the court's perspective, was it the same three judges

5

that did the -- that did the plan, the court-ordered

6

plan?

7

told us in his latest opinion that they never

8

anticipated that as being a permanent plan, and indeed,

9

they tried to stay as close as they could to the then-

10
11

And I thought that the -- the judge who presided

existing plan.
MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, there was some

12

language to that effect.

13

read the opinion that the -- the judges wrote in -- in

14

2001 when they actually were describing in meticulous

15

detail their process of drawing the map, he

16

specifically said then that they didn't follow the old

17

lines, that they used neutral criteria like compactness

18

and following political subdivisions, and that they --

19

this was not an effort to -- to come up with a map that

20

matched the old map.

21

If you go back, though, and

The only thing that I think really fairly can

22

be said about the court-drawn map is it did give a

23

separate district to all of the incumbents, which is

24

what you'd expect a court to do.

25

sit around and decide mutual incumbents ought to have

They're not going to

1

to run against each other.

2

effect, I think, of allowing some incumbency advantage

3

to continue on.

And so it did have that

4

But it is -- it is not true that the -- that

5

the court tried to keep some pattern in the map beyond

6

that.

7

when it drew the map, and then it said in --

8
9

The court specifically said otherwise in 2001

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we're not -- we're

not trying the court for a bad intent.

We're looking

10

at the effect of what it's done, and if the effect of

11

what it's done is to leave in place something that's

12

slanted based on -- on statewide registration in favor

13

of the Democrats, then -- then, it seems to me, there's

14

-- there's a ground for the new legislature to act.

15

And -- and one -- one reason legislatures may

16

not have redrawn plans often is because they always

17

protect incumbents.

18

MR. SMITH:

But, Your Honor, the facts are

19

that it wasn't slanted.

20

testified from both sides at the trial that the map was

21

fair to both parties and that it contained 20

22

Republican districts.

23

25

about vestiges of gerrymanders.

That's true.

I mean, look at the way the

So these were

This was not a gerrymander

Mr. Smith, may -- may I ask

22

you to comment on -- on one problem that I have with

23

your position that has nothing whatever to do with the

24

-- with the fact that there was a -- a judicial

25

redrawing in the first place here?

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

If I understand your argument, you're saying

2

that a -- a districting that takes place prior to the

3

report of a new decennial census, which is done for

4

purely political reasons, maximizing political

5

advantage, is invalid for that reason, I guess under

6

the Equal Protection Clause.

7

MR. SMITH:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

Yes, Your Honor.
And yet, I take it it's also

your position that if the districting is done in

10

response to the new decennial figures so that there's a

11

need to do something to conform to one person/one vote,

12

that there is nothing illegitimate about political

13

motivation, at least up to some point --

14

MR. SMITH:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16
17

Right.
-- in -- in drawing the

lines at that time.
How can we in principle say that the

18

motivation which is legitimate in 1991 is somehow

19

constitutionally illegitimate and dispositive in 1995?

20

MR. SMITH:

It seems to me that one is not

21

saying that it's legitimate in 1991.

22

that in redistricting, which is a messy process, we

23

tolerate a lot of mixed motives.

24

consideration of race.

We -- we ask for some

25

consideration of race.

We tolerate some consideration

One is saying

We tolerate some

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of politics.

2

the rational basis test from a law that is passed

3

solely for political reasons because it doesn't have

4

the other kinds of interests that are being promoted

5

and protected in -- at the beginning of the decade.

6

And so there's a drastic difference, it seems to me,

7

under the rational basis analysis between a law which

8

serves a lot of purposes, some governmental and public,

9

some of them private, and -- and not legitimate bases

10
11

But that is dramatically different under

for governmental action.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you're making the

12

assumption that a mid-decennial districting is not

13

interested in compactness, it's not interested in

14

counties, it's not interested in keeping a university

15

within one -- within one district.

16

just simply not true.

17

MR. SMITH:

That's -- that's

Well, Your Honor, the -- the fact

18

here is that the only reason they decided to change was

19

for partisanship.

20

as a matter of fact.

21

That's what the district court found

Now, the other legal requirements of -- of

22

the map that are -- give you the -- the legitimate

23

bases for redrawing the lines at the beginning of the

24

decade were already satisfied because such a map

25

already existed.

And as this Court said in -- in

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Growe, the -- the court-drawn map, in some sense,

2

changes the status quo.

3

additional governmental interests that are -- that

4

exist and justify going through this process again and

5

changing that map, which already is fully lawful, has

6

been affirmed by this -- this Court as lawful.

7

You have to say what are the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But your answer, both to the

8

Justice Kennedy and -- and to me, ultimately comes

9

down, I guess, to saying that political partisanship

10

alone, undiluted, unadulterated by any other

11

motivations, is per se wrong.

12

MR. SMITH:

It's -- it's not a basis that can

13

justify public conduct, State action.

14

then it would be perfectly okay, I suppose, to have

15

government subsidies for some parties and not for

16

others, or to have -- let some people use public

17

facilities and not others.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

If -- if it was,

Let's -- let's

19

assume that the -- that the partisans who do the mid

20

term redistricting candidly say, we are doing this for

21

partisan reasons, but we recognize limits on what we

22

can do.

23

compactness, et cetera.

24

in fact, evidence of a good faith effort at least to

25

conform to those districting principles.

And the limits are the traditional ones,
Let us assume that there is,

Under those

32
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

circumstances, is the mid-term redistricting equally

2

illegitimate?

3

MR. SMITH:

The question I think you need to

4

pose is what is the justification for doing anything,

5

not -- not for any particular line --

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that may be, but how

7

about the question that I posed?

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. SMITH:

10
11

Well, it seems to me, Your Honor,

that if -- if the -- I was trying to get to an answer.
I really was.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. SMITH:

Okay.

It seems to me that if -- if you

14

can -- if they can legitimately and -- and plausibly

15

say, we are -- we -- we decided to redraw the old map

16

because it was so departed -- it's so departed from

17

these important principles and values like compactness

18

and respect for subdivision -- so if that's our reason

19

--

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

I'm -- in a way, I'm

21

making it easy for you.

22

they're saying we think we can get a better deal for

23

our party, but we are respecting these districting

24

principles.

25

I'm saying, look, they're --

Equally illegitimate?

MR. SMITH:

I think so, Your Honor.

If all

33
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

they're saying is we -- we didn't go as crazy as we

2

could have, but the only reason we did anything is

3

because we want more seats, but we could have done even

4

worse, that seems to me not a -- not a justification

5

for action, but merely a -- a decision not to -- to be

6

more political than purely political.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The difficulty I have with

8

that is that it is -- it is impossible -- I think you

9

would agree.

It is impossible -- and may, indeed --

10

let's assume undesirable -- to take partisanship out of

11

a political process.

12

and simple, even though subject to the discipline of

13

districting principles, is -- is illegitimate, then I

14

don't see why that does not imply the illegitimacy of

15

any districting at any time.

16

MR. SMITH:

And -- and if partisanship pure

Well, Your Honor, our -- our

17

submission is it makes a difference when it's pure

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Before you do that, may I

just ask one short question?
MR. SMITH:

Sure.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You've mainly attacked the

2

plan as a whole in your briefs.

3

often look at particular districts, as you may know.

4

Are there residents of districts 23, district 24 that

5

are plaintiffs?

6

MR. SMITH:

And I'm wondering.

We have plaintiffs in every

7

district, I think, on the whole map, certainly any

8

district that would raise a concern under --

9
10
11

I

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But they're not identified

easily -MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, but -- but I

12

think that there -- there was a -- in the complaint

13

there's allegations about where each of these people

14

live, and I think that -- that we were very careful to

15

make sure anything we were talking about specifically,

16

such as, for example, district 24 in Dallas, we had --

17

we had plaintiffs.

18

there is standing, I think, for all of those arguments.

The -- the list is quite long.

So

19

Now, on -- on district 24, our submission is

20

that under section 2, there ought to be protection for

21

districts where the minority group does not have an

22

absolute majority but where the evidence shows that it

23

can effectively elect a candidate of its choice in --

24

in concert with a -- a predictable group of Anglo or

25

sometimes Hispanic crossover voters, and that we think

35
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

on the facts of this case, this was such a district

2

because the African Americans in every case were a

3

large majority of the voters in the Democratic primary

4

and the Democratic nominee, in virtually every case, is

5

elected in this district regardless of what -- what

6

race that person may be.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What was the

8

percentage of the African American voters in the

district as a whole?

26 percent, Your Honor.

12

The --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but if -- if your --

13

if your test is that section 2 ought to be opened up to

14

any racial group that could influence an -- an election,

I don't see the limits on your principle.

MR. SMITH:

17

election, and --

19

That's not our -- our test, Your

Our test is they -- they have to control the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that if you had a

20

situation where it's 40 percent one group, 40 percent

21

another group, and 20 percent where the 20 percent

22

controlled who was elected by siding with one group or

23

the other group, then you would say that that was an

24

influence district for that small -- the smallest group

25

in the district?

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I don't think that

2

would work because I think the way we -- we view what

3

you have -- you -- the group has to be able to decide

4

who's going to be on the ballot, and then you want to

5

see whether there's enough crossover voting to --

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

Suppose there's a

primary where it works that they can get on the ballot.
Suppose we're looking at the general election.
MR. SMITH:

If -- if that group gets to

decide who gets on the ballot --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Accept the hypothetical.

12

MR. SMITH:

If that group has -- has

Yes.

13

picked who gets on the ballot and their choice always

14

wins the general election, I think that's not an

15

influence district.

16

That's -- that's --

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the answer?

I mean,

17

you've read the briefs.

18

there are many, many districts in the United States

19

where African American voters have a big influence on

20

the Democratic primary.

The obvious reply to that is

21

MR. SMITH:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
A lot.

And there are a lot

23

where the Democrat wins.

24

accepted, says the other side, that means that any

25

district that's drawn here to favor the Democrats can't

So if your principle is

be changed, but all the ones that favor the Republicans

2

can be changed.

3

hard for me to accept, but that's a neutral principle

4

of constitutional law.

5

your response is to that.

6

Now, if that argument is right, it's

MR. SMITH:

So I want to see what -- what

I think there are a number of

7

limiting principles that apply here that -- that

8

suggest we're not just coming in here and asking for

9

the Voting Rights Act to become the -- the pro-

10
11
12

Democratic act -JUSTICE BREYER:
That's why I would like --

13

MR. SMITH:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15
16

Obviously you're not.

And -- and --- you to say what

specifically the answer to that argument is.
MR. SMITH:

The -- the -- first of all, there

17

are not that many districts in which African Americans

18

control the Democratic primary and then have

19

predictable ability to see that person elected in -- in

20

the general election.

21

then have representation of the kind that I think is

22

valuable under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

23
24
25

Where that is the truth, they

Now, of course, there are going to be limits.
One of them is De Grandy.

2

protecting this kind of district, what you do is, in

3

fact, condemn the people, the African Americans in

4

Texas, to less than proportional representation because

5

there is no other way to give them a district in which

6

they have any possibility of -- of participation in the

7

process and electing a candidate of their choice.

8

is the only place in Texas where it can be done.

9

They're -- they are more than an eighth of the

This

10

population, citizen voting age population, and they're

11

only getting 3 districts out of 32 because the State of

12

Texas chose to eliminate this district.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

This would be at -- least

14

your criterion, whether we accept it or not, would --

15

would be more administrable if we're dealing with the

16

elimination of a district than if we were dealing with

17

the question of creating one.

18

that the NAAC brief does that there really should be

19

distinct criteria, depending on whether you're asking

20

to create something new or preserve something which has

21

been in place?

22

MR. SMITH:

Do you take the position

I -- I perhaps have more faith in

23

the ability of courts to predict the future than -- than

24

that brief does, but -- but I certainly can imagine a

25

rule where the court says, we're going to require that

Washington, DC 20005

1

there be experience, not simply predictions by experts,

2

in order to create a district below the majority level.

3

That would be an administrable rule which would give

-- at least give some protection in situations of the

kind that we -- we face here.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-439

12

MS. PERALES:

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I will begin by arguing that Texas violated

15

the Equal Protection Clause by making excessive use of

race in its changes to district 23.

17

100,000 Latinos from district 23, the State used race

18

to craft a razor-thin Latino majority.

population.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

impression of Latino support for that incumbent.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Focus for a minute just on

3

the -- what we can call the removal, the drawing of the

4

lines to exclude some Latino voters.

5

that, not the later justification.

6

found that this was for political reasons, not racial

7

reasons, even though it was a largely racial group that

8

was removed.

9

erroneous?

10

Just focus on
The district court

Do you attack that finding as clearly

MS. PERALES:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, we do

11

attack that finding as clearly erroneous.

12

really the flip side of Easley v. Cromartie because in

13

this case Latino voters supported Republican and

14

Democratic candidates.

15

vigorously, Latino voters voted significantly and

16

substantially --

17

This case is

As the State asserts

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I interrupt you just

18

with one -- one question on district 23?

19

what the intent of the parties was, I'm just wondering

20

why is the district court's finding on intent relevant

21

to the section 2 issue when the test under section 2 is

22

results?

23
24
25

MS. PERALES:

Regardless of

Yes, Justice Stevens.

The --

the test under section 2 is results, and that goes -JUSTICE STEVENS:

So that even if the intent

41
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

was primarily political, it would still violate section

2

2.

3

MS. PERALES:

Yes, and we argue in our brief

4

exactly that.

5

argument at least first on the Fourteenth Amendment

6

violation, which is the intentional use of race both as

7

intentional vote dilution, as well as the analytically

8

distinct claim under Shaw v. Miller.

9

But we hope today to focus in oral

With respect to the question whether Latino

10

voters voted with such a high correlation -- and that's

11

the phrase used from Easley v. Cromartie -- whether

12

there was such a high correlation between Latino voters

13

and Democratic voters, particularly in district 23, to

14

justify removing them because of their race and then

15

saying that they were Democrats, that nexus simply

16

doesn't exist under the facts of this case.

17

Besides the State's arguments and -- and the

18

many assertions that it makes with respect to Latino

19

voting support for Republican candidates and especially

20

Congressman Bonilla, we also have Latino voting for

21

Bonilla that rises and falls.

22

adherents to the Democratic ticket, you wouldn't see

23

fluctuating support for Congressman Bonilla.

24

see low and steady support if Latinos were Democratic

25

voters.

If Latinos were close

You would

Instead, we see something very different,

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

which is Congressman Bonilla gaining support in the

2

Latino community within his district up until 1996

3

where the peak is 30 percent Latino support and then a

4

steady decline over a series of elections, ending in

5

2002 with only 8 percent, as the district court found,

6

Latino support for Congressman Bonilla.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is not --

Does that undermine

8

the assumption that there's -- they're voting as a

9

bloc?

30 percent of the group is voting for one

10

candidate.

11

bloc?

12

Is that sufficient to establish a voting

MS. PERALES:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

Under

13

section 2's question with respect to racially polarized

14

voting, we would contend that voting as a bloc 70

15

percent or subsequently higher than 70 percent to 90-92

16

percent is enough under section 2 to satisfy the test

17

whether Latinos are voting cohesively.

18

Bonilla has never been able to garner a majority of

19

Latino support, not more than 30 percent.

20

Congressman

But with respect to a somewhat different

21

question, which is whether partisanship and race

22

correlate so highly in district 23, that you can remove

23

Latinos and in the hopes of being able to take the

24

Democratic index down, we say that that kind of voting

25

is not tight enough.

In Easley v. Cromartie, of

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

course, the Court found that African American voters

2

voted 95 to 97 percent for Democratic candidates across

3

elections.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand.

Does

5

this go to motive or result?

6

I'm stupid and I think there's the correlation and I

remove it for that reason?

racial reasons.

remove Democrats.

I mean, what if I'm --

I'm not removing them for

And you're saying that if I have

10

made a mistake about how solidly they vote Democratic,

11

that turns my validly non-racial decision into a racial

12

decision?

13

MS. PERALES:

This Court made clear in Bush

14

v. Vera that the State may not make exactly the kind of

15

assumption, Justice Scalia, that you described.

16

the Court held in Bush v. Vera that you cannot use race

17

as a proxy for partisanship.

18

assumption.

19

The --

You cannot make that

So if the State --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but -- but that was

20

because it was deliberate in that case, and that's not

21

the hypothetical that Justice Scalia has posed.

22

MS. PERALES:

In this case, we contend that

23

the State removed Latino voters from district 23

24

because they were Latino and that --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's not the

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

hypothetical that was posed to you by the Justice.

6

That if the State -I'm assuming -As I -- as I understood it.
-- they're removing them

because they're Democrats, but I'm wrong about that.

7

MS. PERALES:

Then it is still wrong to take

8

out 100,000 Latinos using that assumption.

9

-- the act that was done was to slice through the most

10

Latino county in the United States, 95 percent Latino.

11

I mean, the

The people were not removed anywhere else.

Clearly,

12

the State removed Latinos from this district and then

13

said, well, we did it because we were aiming for

14

Democrats.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But is it -- is it wrong

16

under the Equal Protection Clause or is it wrong under

17

section 2?

18
19
20

MS. PERALES:

It's wrong under both, we would

argue in our brief.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

But on Justice --

21

Justice Scalia's hypothesis, there is no intention to

22

remove Latinos as Latinos.

23

that is if you're removing Latinos, it does not matter

24

whether your motivation is invidious or not.

25

know whether that's your position.

And maybe the answer to

I don't

But it -- if that's

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not your position, then I think there's got to be a

2

difference between the -- the Equal Protection Clause

3

analysis and the section 2 analysis.

4

MS. PERALES:

We contend that in this case

5

the removal is invidious because it was Latinos that

6

were identified and taken out and then -- for

7

incumbency protection, similar to what --

8
9
10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, is that because there

were no other Democrats who could have been identified
and taken out?

11

MS. PERALES:

There's no testimony that the

12

State considered ever taking out anybody else but the

13

people in Webb County.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought you said that the

county was 92 percent Latino or something like that.

16

MS. PERALES:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Justice Scalia.
Well, how can you -- how can

18

you possibly take out any substantial number of

19

Democrats without taking out Latinos?

MS. PERALES:

That's exactly our point, that

the State removed --

does it matter whether they're in or out?

13

under the facts of this case, what had happened by 2002

14

was something very, very different.

you're right that the -- the vote is split over time,

No, Mr. Chief Justice, because

We would contend, Mr. Chief

5

highlights that the State was seeking voters, Latino

6

voters, who had withdrawn their support for Congressman

Bonilla as opposed to just seeking Democrats because you

can vote against Congressman Bonilla and still vote

Republican in other races, as Latinos did.

And it, in fact,

10

could have been a former supporter of Congressman

12

that race and partisanship are completely

interchangeable so that the State can scoop in and grab

100,000 people of the same race and then say later,

This Court has held that race

may not be used for its own sake in redistricting, and

18

here race was used most gratuitously and cynically to

19

make sure that the State could say a majority of

20

Latinos in district 23 support Congressman Bonilla.

21

The chief redistricter in the House, Representative

22

Phil King, testified -- and this is expressed motivation

23

-- that they sought to maintain a 50 percent Latino

24

voting age majority in the district while making it

25

safer for Congressman Bonilla, which involved pulling

neighborhoods of the City of Laredo so that we could

2

say it was a Latino majority district.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, isn't -- isn't one

4

answer that we were doing it, number one, because we

5

wanted to protect the incumbent and we also had to use

6

race to avoid a section 5 problem and a section 2

7

claim?

8
9

You've got to use race for those purposes.
MS. PERALES:

Well, under section 5, the

State went ahead and created district 25 as the offset

10

because it seemed fairly clear that district 23 had

11

been dismantled to such a degree it was no longer going

12

to be able to be used for section 5 purposes.

13

Similarly, under section 2, the State saw

14

that it was terribly vulnerable and so again tried to

15

make an offset district which caused its own problems.

16

So the use of race here to achieve the 50.9

17

percent voting age majority was not to satisfy the

18

Voting Rights Act, either section 5 or section 2.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you could have used that

20

reasoning to create a district in the first place, but

21

you cannot use that reasoning to create an offset

22

district in the second place at the same time that

23

you're trying to protect an incumbent.

24

what you're saying.

25

MS. PERALES:

I think that's

State, it would be obvious that you weren't going to

yield an opportunity district.

saying that would be implausible as a section 2/section

to protect minority voters, States will have free rein

to use race to manipulate not only electoral outcomes,

as it did here, but also the complexion of a district

in order to be able to express some kind of symbolic --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

MR. CRUZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The central issue in resolving these various

8

challenges to mid-decade redistricting is determining

9

which institution is constitutionally vested with the

10

primary responsibility for redistricting.

11

legislatures or Federal courts.

12

Elected

In Texas, for the first time in 12 years, the

13

legislature acted to adopt a congressional

14

redistricting map.

15

the most profoundly anti-majoritarian congressional

16

maps in the country with a map that reflects the

17

demonstrated preferences --

18

That map, in turn, replaced one of

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But may I ask, General

19

Cruz, are you talking about replacing the court-ordered

20

map or the preceding Democrat gerrymandered map?

21

MR. CRUZ:

The legislature replaced the

22

court-ordered map, but the court found as a factual

23

matter that the court-ordered map, in the court's

24

words, quote, perpetuated the 1991 Democratic Party

25

gerrymander, and that was the court characterizing its

59

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but you don't think it

really perpetuated the same degree of gerrymandering

4

that was present in the earlier map, do you?

MR. CRUZ:

Well, the court's map, under the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.

MR. CRUZ:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

Do you think it did?

Do

you think --

11

13

I'm asking you.

Yes, we do.
-- the court-ordered map is

just as bad as the Democratic map?
MR. CRUZ:

The district court found that it

15

had blunted some of the most egregious lines, but under

16

the district court's map, 28 of 28 incumbents were

17

reelected. So the identical outcome was yielded.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But is your opponent

19

correct in saying that in six of those districts, the

20

Democrat won even though the district was majority

21

Republican?

22
23
24
25

MR. CRUZ:

That -- that is correct, and then

the district court -JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. CRUZ:

It -- it depends.

The districts

were drawn such that the Democrats who were running

were incumbency.

elections is that incumbency is a tremendous advantage,

5

and in the face of incumbency --

6

And the reality of congressional

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

I was going to say I --

7

if I were gerrymandering, I would absolutely want to

leave majority other party districts in which the

people from the other party were voting for a candidate

10

from my party with some regularity.

11

that.

12

do.

That's exactly what I'd want a gerrymander to

13
14

I'd want to do

MR. CRUZ:

And that's exactly right.

These

districts were drawn to protect incumbents.

15

It is notable that if one looks on a national

16

level, the 2001 map drawn by the court led to the most

17

anti-majoritarian results of any of the 50 States in

18

the Union.

19

than five Members of Congress that saw a minority of

20

voters electing a majority of the delegation, and those

21

were Illinois and Tennessee.

22

percent in Illinois elected one extra seat to Congress;

23

in Tennessee, 48 percent.

24

percent of the two-party vote and 41 percent of the

25

overall State vote elected not just a one-seat

There were only two other States with more

In each of those, 49

In Texas, by contrast, 45

2

national level, the prior map was the most profoundly

3

anti-majoritarian.

4

And so on any

Now, this Court resolved in -- in Vieth that

5

majoritarianism is not a constitutional mandate, but

6

that being said, as Mr. Smith characterized in Vieth,

7

he characterized the fundamental principle of democracy

8

-- and this is Mr. Smith's characterization -- is the

9

principle that a majority can elect a majority of the

10

delegation.

11

And as this Court concluded in Gaffney v.

12

Cummings, achieving political fairness, achieving a

13

rough sense of proportionality, such that a majority

14

can elect a majority of the delegation, is not only

15

legitimate, it is salutary.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is --

All right.

So I -- I wrote

17

an opinion, as you know, where I was agreeing with you

18

on that, and I wonder if -- if then the thing to do

19

would be to say, yes, indeed, a legislature can redraw

20

a map to prevent a minority of the voters electing a

21

majority of the congressional delegation.

22

they do that, there has to be some reasonable assurance

23

that it works the same way for both parties.

24

a standard.

25

guess there wasn't that much agreement, but -- but --

But when

I mean as

I thought my standard worked before.

I

Washington, DC 20005

1

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- from the point of view of

3

-- of taking that standard, which you agree with, I'm

4

glad to say, apparently, and modifying it to be sure it

5

works out the same way for both.

6

MR. CRUZ:

Justice Breyer, under the standard

7

articulated in your opinion in Vieth, in our judgment

8

the result would be a straightforward affirmance here

9

because the map that was adopted is precisely what was

10

advocated in Vieth of a majority of the population

11

electing a majority of the delegation.

12

That being said, the question here is not

13

whether that is required.

14

1992 the Republicans in Texas brought a political

15

gerrymandering challenge to the predecessor map here,

16

and that map was rejected -- that challenge was

17

rejected under Bandemer, and the district court in 1992

18

told the Republican plaintiffs -- said even though this

19

may be tilted against you, there is nothing to prevent

20

you, over the ensuing decade, from running candidates,

21

from building support, and from eventually taking

22

control by electing your candidates to the machinery of

23

government and adopting a map you deem fair.

24
25

Indeed, it is ironic.

In

That -- those words of the district court
prove prescient because that is precisely what happened

63
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

over the ensuing decade, and it is equally true today.

2

There is nothing in Texas to prevent the Democratic

3

Party from doing the exact same thing over the ensuing

4

decade if they can command a majority of votes at the

5

polls.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you this

7

question?

8

plan is well-justified and makes gains and so forth.

9

Does that necessarily mean that every district within

10

the -- the plan is immune from constitutional attack?

11

Assume you're correct that as a whole the

MR. CRUZ:

Of course, it does not, and there

12

are a variety of district-specific attacks.

13

plaintiffs have framed their partisan gerrymandering

14

attack as one that focuses on the map as a whole.

15

-- and the --

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

MR. CRUZ:

The

And

I understand.

-- and the reason for that is that

18

in the Vieth decision, Justice Kennedy's concurrence

19

was the controlling concurrence, and it set out a

20

standard for subsequent partisan gerrymandering cases

21

that litigants should find a, quote, substantive

22

definition of fairness in districting that commands

23

general assent.

24
25

Rather than attempt to meet that challenge,
the plaintiffs have refused to discuss effects at all,

64
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

and that's not by accident because any assessment of

2

effects would yield that the current plan is more fair

3

than the predecessor.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the -- the next

5

question I wanted to ask you is that if it is possible

6

there can be a single-district challenge, what is the

7

justification for the -- the cracking of district 24,

8

which was a majority Democratic district before, into

9

five different districts, none of which would elect a

11
12

Democrat.

at the beginning of the decade any effort to adopt a

map because if they're able to deadlock the system, if

they are able, as happened in Texas, to flee the State

MR. CRUZ:

concerned about section 5, and with respect to the

adjustment in -- in district 23, it was possible that

the Department of Justice might deem the alteration of

2

appellants focus on principally -- the candidate that

ran against Congressman Bonilla was Henry Cuellar, a

4

popular, local politician from Laredo, and he had a

5

very strong following in Laredo.

6

Mr. Cuellar did very well in that election, came within

7

slightly under 4 points of beating Mr. Bonilla and Mr.

Bonilla's percentage of the -- of the Latino vote

dropped to its lowest historic point.

10

And in 2002 -- the race that the GI Forum

And as a consequence,

That, as the district court found, was also

11

aberrational because of Mr. Cuellar's very strong local

12

support, and the clearest evidence of that is under the

13

new map, when half of Webb County was placed in the

14

adjoining district, district 28, Mr. Cuellar ran

15

against the incumbent Democratic Congressman, Ciro

16

Rodriguez, and beat him in the primary, which

17

demonstrates that his success was because the -- the

18

voters in Laredo are supporters of Mr. Cuellar and,

19

accordingly, voted for him against either opponent,

20

Henry Bonilla or Mr. Rodriguez.

21

And so, when the legislature was determining

22

which section of voters to remove for political

23

reasons, the region that voted heavily against Mr.

24

Bonilla in the preceding election, Laredo, Webb County,

25

was a natural place to move voters who had in the last

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course, the reason

the lines are straight is nobody is there.

22

MR. CRUZ:

But those counties have to be

23

placed in some district.

24

call a series of seven whole contiguous counties a land

25

bridge, but those are very sparsely populated counties.

And -- and so the appellants

1

In whatever district they're in, they're going to have

2

to connect with a population zone.

3

district court found as a factual matter is that the

4

elongated nature -- the relatively elongated nature of

5

district 25 was a function of the geography and the

6

fact that you have population along the border and then

7

you have a large space of relatively low population,

8

and then you have to get back up to population.

9

Texas historically has run north-south districts to get

And what the

So

10

enough population to form a congressional district

11

under this Court's one person/one vote precedents.

12

District 25, if one examines -- the district

13

court expressly found that the plaintiffs failed to

14

prove purposeful discrimination.

15

introduced at trial a Cromartie analysis that was

16

precisely drawn from this Court's first Cromartie

17

decision, Hunt v. Cromartie, and it's found on pages

18

331 and 332 of the joint appendix.

19

analysis did is precisely what this Court found in

20

Cromartie I was sufficient on summary judgment to

21

defeat a claim of racial gerrymandering.

22

The State defendants

And what that

It assessed the lines in Travis County, the

23

northern part of district 25, and it asked are the cuts

24

the legislature made driven by politics or driven by

25

race.

And so what the State's expert did is drew a map

85
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that would be based on race that would maximize the

2

Hispanics in district 25 on the northern end of Travis

3

County.

4

legislature had drawn and said what are the differences

5

between what it would look like if the legislature was

6

attempting to maximize race as compared to what it

7

would look like if it was attempting to maximize party.

8

And what the State's expert found is there was on the

9

He then compared that map to the map that the

order of a 1 percent differential which is you're

10

talking between 24 and 25 percent.

11

percent differential of fewer Hispanics in the State's

12

map and more Democrats in the State's map.

13

the State's expert found is precisely along the lines

14

as the evidence in Cromartie I that the legislature had

15

drawn the map looking for Democrats rather than looking

16

for Hispanics.

17

So it was about 4

And so what

In addition, if one examines the two

18

numerical measures of compactness, smallest circle and

19

perimeter to area, smallest circle this map measured

20

8.5, which is smaller than North Carolina's

21

reconfigured district 12 upheld in Cromartie, which was

22

8.6

23

Its perimeter-to-area score, 9.5, is terribly low.

As a -- as a means of comparison, districts 18, 29,

24

and 30 that this Court struck down in Vera had

25

perimeter-to-area scores of 106, 144, and 69, as

JUSTICE STEVENS:

General Cruz, if you've

3

finished your answer -- I didn't want to interrupt you,

4

but that makes -- reminds me of a question I wanted to

5

answer you because -- ask you, rather, because you make

6

a very persuasive argument in your brief, which I found

7

very helpful, that the -- a State should be able to

8

correct a prior gerrymander by -- for -- with political

9

motivations.

10

I would like you to comment on this

11

suggestion.

12

right to do that with one caveat, that any new district

13

has to be more compact -- no more -- no less compact

14

than its predecessor, wouldn't that avoid all sorts of

15

problems?

16

Supposing we said they have an absolute

MR. CRUZ:

That could be a salutary policy

17

goal, and -- and Congress could certainly enact that.

18

But I -- I see no -- no source in the Constitution

19

placing that requirement upon States particularly --

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We have -- we have quite a

21

history, as you just identified in your response to

22

Justice Kennedy, of being concerned about particularly

23

grotesque shapes, and that's why they developed these

24

tests of compactness for use in this very litigation.

25

And the fact that the lawyers have come up with this

87
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

approach to it makes me think maybe it does have some

2

relevance to the whole problem we're trying to

3

confront.

4

MR. CRUZ:

At an extreme level, lack of

5

compactness can indicate something was going on.

6

one looks at the districts this Court has struck down,

7

if you look at Bush v. Vera -- and we have in the joint

8

appendix the silhouettes of those districts that were

9

-- you know, had fingers going out in every direction.

10
11
12

If

There's plainly something questionable going on.
These districts are nothing like that.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

When I -- when I was

13

thinking about this problem, I looked at district 24.

14

The thing that was interesting to me is that most of

15

the neutral justifications that you describe -- and

16

they're certainly in the -- in the five new districts

17

that replaced it, but in the key part of the population

18

that was moved, it becomes much less compact than it

19

was before.

20

MR. CRUZ:

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22
23
24
25

The -- the new map -Which it seems to me quite

significant.
MR. CRUZ:

The -- the new map was somewhat

less compact than the prior map, but it does -JUSTICE STEVENS:

particular reference to the targeted group that was

2

moved out of the district.

3

MR. CRUZ:

But lack of compactness does not

4

-- no one has brought a racial gerrymandering claim

5

with respect to districts other than 25 and, to some

6

extent, 23, although the 23 challenge is not a typical

7

racial gerrymandering claim.

8

10
11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm suggesting the

challenge to 24 should be a political gerrymandering
challenge.
MR. CRUZ:

I understand that, although a

12

majority of the Court in Vieth concluded that in order

13

for a political gerrymandering claim to succeed, that

14

there must be a substantive standard for fairness to

15

measure the map against some baseline.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, Justice Stevens --

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And that's the standard I'm

18

suggesting.

Right.

That's exactly the point.

19

MR. CRUZ:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The compactness standard.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.

22

MR. CRUZ:

But --

But the Court had before it --

23

appellants urged in Vieth compactness, principles of

24

cracking, principles of packing.

25

Justices advocated that standard, and yet, a majority

of the Court -- the plurality explicitly rejected it.

And Justice Kennedy's concurrence explicitly rejected

3

the standards discussed in the dissents, including a

4

standard looking to compactness.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure that Justice

Stevens is suggesting that as a standard.

suggesting it as a disqualifier.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let -- let me ask you this.

Suppose you have a court that's required to

3

redistrict, and the court has two experts.

4

number one says, here is a plan.

5

in its orientation, but it balances the Democratic and

6

the Republican registration.

It gives them exactly

7

proportional representation.

Plan number two gives

8

minimal consideration to this, but it's compact.

9

takes into account geography, communities of interest,

10

and so forth.

11

it adopted the first plan?

12

Expert

It's totally partisan

It

Would the district court be in error if

MR. CRUZ:

Well, that -- that question

13

actually was litigated in this case, the first time in

14

2001, as part of the litigation over how to draw the

15

new map.

16

the district court was that the old map was no longer

17

consistent with how Texas voters were voting.

18

district court concluded that under the Upham case, it

19

lacked the authority to take that into account and to

20

change the demonstrated policy preferences of the last

21

legislative map.

22

case, the district court found although it didn't

23

intend to work partisan bias, that that was the effect

24

of its map.

25

One of the arguments that was presented to

And the

And that's why, on remand in this

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but my hypothetical

91
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is designed to suggest that partisanship, political

2

lines should be certainly a secondary consideration to

3

a valid principled scheme and that perhaps in the

4

hypothetical case, you could reverse a district court

5

for abuse of discretion in -- in overemphasizing

6

political considerations.

7

means that there is some standard lurking out there

8

indicating that political considerations should be of

9

at least secondary importance.

10

MR. CRUZ:

And then if that's true, it

In this case, the district court

11

was presented with maps that would be more fair on --

12

on pretty much any measure of partisanship, and what

13

the district court concluded is it didn't have the

14

ability -- that making that judgment was a political

15

judgment, and it was the legislature's job to do it.

16

And so it drew in the districts it was required to draw

17

because Texas had two new districts.

18

it believed the Voting Rights Act required, and beyond

19

that, it made as few changes as possible.

20

It drew in what

And so the district court recognized that the

21

consequence of that map-drawing technique is whatever

22

partisan bias was there before is reflected in its own

23

map that just neutrally carries over the preexisting

24

bias.

25

perpetuating the prior bias, not because it intended to

And that's why the district court found it was

do so, but because it was consciously restraining

2

itself from doing anything to alter the partisan

3

composition other than to carry over what was already

4

there.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- district 24.

I take

6

it -- it's a long walking stick is what it looks like.

7

And the -- I take it you're saying when I go back to

8

the record here, I'll discover a finding that the

9

district court made.

10

They said this was not an effort

to use race to district.

11

Is that right?

And one of the reasons that you think that is

12

because, although it's not a circle, it's not

13

absolutely terrible.

14

the ultimate conclusion they did not use race.

15

right?

16
17

MR. CRUZ:

That -- that is a supporter of
Is that

Justice Breyer, that's -- that's

exactly correct --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then -- then if I -- if I --

19

so I have to go back, look at the record, and see what

20

it says.

21

Now, suppose I came to a different

22

conclusion.

23

the rationale for using race to district was because we

24

want to avoid a section 2 violation.

25

would lose, however, because you can't use that

Then you might still win on this point if

And there, you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

rationale unless, according to Bush v. Vera, the

2

district that you draw is, in their words, reasonably

3

compact.

4

district that looks like a walking stick is reasonably

5

compact for that other purpose.

6

So, again, you'd have to say that this

MR. CRUZ:

Is that right?

Well, although we would submit

7

this district is reasonably compact.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Yes, so I understand that.

But -- but if -- if I -- you have two bites at this

10

apple with your reasonably compactness.

11

to say it wasn't -- you think this proves it wasn't to

12

use race in the first place, but if I'm wrong on that,

13

it's still a legitimate use of race because it's a

14

reasonably compact effort to conform with section 2.

15

MR. CRUZ:

One, you want

Justice Breyer, you're correct

16

that if the Court concludes this district is not

17

reasonably compact, then under its precedents, it

18

wouldn't be a narrowly tailored way to satisfy a voting

19

rights violation, but --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And is there anything I can

21

look to to decide what reasonably compact means in that

22

second --

23

MR. CRUZ:

Well, the district court's finding

24

was that Texas geography and population dispersion

25

limit the availability of district compactness in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

southern and western regions of the State, and that was

at the Jackson jurisdictional statement, page 154a.

that's -- there's -- there's a challenge in Texas

because you've got these --

JUSTICE BREYER:
MR. CRUZ:

Yes, 25.

25 has seven whole counties and

11

only two county splits, which is unusual.

12

cases that this Court has struck down what it's

13

perceived to be racial gerrymanders have been a number

14

of county splits.

15

those were mandated to -- because we have achieve

16

perfect equipopulosity, so we had to get exactly,

17

within one person, precise lines.

18

between the two, they are whole contiguous counties

19

that are longstanding geographic units.

have been used in Texas.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

General Cruz, why wouldn't

4

it be a -- at least a helpful guide to what is

5

reasonably compact to compare with the preceding

district?

7

understand.

8

reasonable compactness is -- is one of the tests?

9

Now, that fits 24 but not necessarily 25 I
Wouldn't that make -- make sense if the

MR. CRUZ:

One could certainly compare the

10

preceding district, and with respect to the preceding

11

district, the differential is -- is not great.

12

somewhat more compact.

13
14

It is

But there were other policy agendas the
district court --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When you're carved out of a

that test?

I mean, isn't -- isn't that a problem with

MR. CRUZ:

That -- that is a certainly a

challenge.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

I suppose if you have a

plaintiff suing, it would be the one he lives in.
MR. CRUZ:

You know, if you compare, for

example, district 25's perimeter-to-area score is 9.6.
You know, if -- if one looks at, for example, the plan

-- one district, district 28, with a higher perimeter-

3

to-area score of -- of 10.0.

4

court found as a factual matter that the demonstration

5

plan submitted by the GI Forum appellants was -- was

6

less compact and critically would not perform.

7

And indeed, the district

Going back to the section 2 question about

8

district 23, the district court found that one district

9

in the demonstration plan, district 28, had only a bare

10

majority of citizen voting population, 50.3 percent,

11

and there was undisputed testimony that for a district

12

to perform in this region, it had to have --

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
why did have just 50.3 percent?

15
16

Why did they have --

MR. CRUZ:

Because the Hispanic population is

dispersed enough that one can't -- one can't draw --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They're doing that to

18

make it look like whoever was elected had Hispanic

19

support in that district?

20

MR. CRUZ:

Is that --

We did not ascribe motives to

21

them.

22

you could draw a district with a bare majority of

23

citizen voting population, although their experts also

24

testified that a bare majority will not elect in this

25

region because of lower voter -- voter turnout.

They -- they drew it to demonstrate that -- that

can't get out of it by saying it's an effort to cure a

MR. CRUZ:

If it is reasonably

And if it isn't, you

Correct, but with respect to the

8

question of racial gerrymandering, this Court's

9

question is, is race the predominant motivation?

10

There's a direct factual finding by the district court

11

that it was not.

12

the -- that the measures of compactness, examined in

13

relationship to the geography and population, reflect

14

the sheer size and population distribution of this

15

area, rather than a calculated stretch to find voters

16

of a particular ethnic makeup.

17
18
19
20

Indeed, the district court said that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You mean 25 -- the -- the

Latino makeup of 25 is accidental?
MR. CRUZ:

It is a function of the population

in south and west Texas.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

MR. CRUZ:

It's accidental.

The -- it is not accidental in the

23

sense that the legislature was unaware of it, and as this

24

Court has said, whenever a legislature is districting,

25

it is aware of the -- the racial distribution.

But it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

was drawing an additional district there, and the

2

district court found that in drawing those lines, it

3

did not reach out to segregate voters on either side

4

based on race, that that was not its intent and that

5

was not the effect of what it in fact drew.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What -- what do you say to

7

Ms. Perales' argument that the -- the numbers are just

8

too precise to have been reflective of anything but a

racial motivation, and that, therefore, the -- the

13
14
15

Well, that -- that concerns

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Aren't they equally precise

here?
MR. CRUZ:

large majority on Hispanic voting age population and

17

also citizen voting age population.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

MR. CRUZ:

I -- I misspoke.

Okay.

With respect to district 23,

20

there's an unusual aspect to the GI Forum appellants'

21

argument in that it's unlike a typical racial

22

gerrymandering claim where they say you're -- you're

23

seeking to draw lines based on race.

24

they should have been more aggressive drawing lines on

into question the districts in a host of other

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

12

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

13

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEES

14

MR. GARRE:

15
16

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The United States' participation in this case

17

is addressed to the Voting Rights Act issues, and our

18

position is that the district court properly concluded

19

that the 2003 plan does not unlawfully dilute minority

20

voting strength in either the Dallas/Fort Worth area or

21

the south and west region of the State.

22

court based that conclusion on factual findings that

23

are entitled to great respect on appeal and that

24

preclude appellants' section 2 claims under this

25

Court's decisions.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you if you agree

2

with General Cruz, that if the results of the 20 --

3

section -- district 23 violated section 2, it would not

4

be a defense that was politically motivated?

5

MR. GARRE:

6

Justice Stevens, insofar as --

7

I -- I think that's right,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And would you also agree

8

with the second question I asked as to whether if it

9

were a violation -- I understand you don't think it was

10

-- it would not be a defense that they were able to

11

create a district -- a Hispanic district in another

12

part of the State.

13

MR. GARRE:

Well, that's true in the context

14

that the Court said it in the Shaw II case, but we

15

don't think that the principle of Shaw II would apply

16

to the section 2 claim in the south and west part of

17

Texas in this case.

18

Court found a violation in the southern part of the

19

State and considered the question as to whether a

20

creation of a district in a completely different part

21

of the State, the middle of the State with no

22

connection, would remedy the section 2 violation, and

23

the Court said no.

24
25

And that's because in Shaw II, the

This case deals with a section 2 claim which
is addressed to a particular region of the State, a

103

common geography and other factors.

And we know that

Mr. Cruz referred to

It's at page 241 of the GI Forum jurisdictional
That's the plan that they claim they're

and it's addressed to the entire part of the State.

11

So in that situation where you've got a claim

12

where you have a -- a Voting Rights Act section 2 claim

13

addressed to a particular region of the State, we don't

14

think that the Shaw II principle would come into a play.

15

Here, we don't think there's any section 2 violation

16

with respect to the elimination of --

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is that based on the

18

premise that section -- that district 25 and district

19

23 are in the same part of the State?

20

MR. GARRE:

Yes, not just the same part of

21

the State, but a part of the State that falls within

22

the section 2 -- within the focus of the plaintiffs'

23

section 2 claim, and a part of the State that's marked

24

by its high concentration of minority citizen voting

25

age population.

104
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

In -- in the De Grandy case, this Court

2

confronted a very similar problem where you had one

3

part of the State, the Miami-Dade area of Florida,

4

which had a high concentration of Hispanic citizen

5

voting age population, and the State was drawing

6

various districts in that part of the State.

7

Court looked to those districts and considered whether

8

there was a proportional representation of the minority

9

group in that area and -- and found that, under the

And the

10

totality of the circumstances, there was, and

11

therefore, there was no violation of section 2.

12

Here, you have a situation where the district

13

court found that the citizen voting age population in

14

the south and west part of the State was 58 percent,

15

and that under the State's plan, Hispanics enjoyed 85

16

percent majority minority districts in that area, which

17

is to say, six of the seven districts under the State's

18

plans were districts in which Hispanics enjoyed a

19

majority of citizen voting age population.

20

The decision within that area of where to

21

draw district lines is a decision that section 2 and

22

this Court's precedents leaves up to the States.

23

in fact, in the De Grandy case, this Court in -- in

24

particular considered the situation where a district

25

line ran through a minority neighborhood and split up

2

of its decision.

3

district line went through that neighborhood and had an

4

effect on minority voters, in terms of which district

5

they went into, didn't in itself establish a section 2

6

violation.

7

The Court discussed it on page 1015
And it said that the fact that the

And we think the same principle would apply

8

here, where the fact that the district lines separating

9

district 23 and 28 in the southern part of the State

10

near Laredo splits a Hispanic neighborhood, which is,

11

after all, not -- not surprising given that the large

12

percentage of the population in that part of the State

13

is Hispanic, doesn't in itself establish a section 2

14

violation.

15

The plaintiffs' section 2 claim in that part

16

of the State really sounds very much in a section 5

17

retrogression or dismantling claim, and this Court made

18

clear in the Holder v. Hall case that retrogression

19

principles of section 5 are not applicable in section 2

20

cases.

21

holds here and that --

22

And we certainly think that that principle

to the cohesiveness analysis under the Gingles factors.

13

I suppose it would go perhaps

I mean, what -- what is clear under this

14

Court's cases and the text of section 2(b) is that the

15

Court has to take into account the totality of the

16

circumstances in the area, not just the rough

17

proportion -- the existence of proportionality between

18

the Hispanic population and the number of districts in

19

which they enjoy a majority, but all the circumstances

20

that could bear on the region.

21

And the district court in this case conducted

22

that analysis and it found, under the totality of the

23

circumstances, that there was an -- that there was not

24

a section 2 violation in the south and west region of

25

the State.

And we certainly think that that finding is

factual finding unless it is left with the definite and

6

firm conviction that a mistake has been made, and we

don't think the record in this case would support such

8

a conclusion with respect to either the section 2 claim

in the south and west or the section 2 claim in the

Dallas/Fort Worth area.

11

As we have explained in our brief, that claim

12

-- and I'm now turning to the Dallas/Fort Worth claim

13

-- fails because of the district court's finding that

14

African American voters in old congressional district

15

24 lacked the ability to elect candidates of choice in

16

that district in the sense that they would be unable,

17

in a contested election, to put their candidate, the

18

African American candidate, into office.

19

too is supported by ample record evidence and we think

20

could not be set aside under the standard that this

Court applies.

That finding

Answer:

Of course, there is.

Well, the only reason you didn't do it

MR. GARRE:

Well, I don't think that would

8

bear on the typical section 2 analysis this Court

9

would apply.

The -- the plaintiffs bear the burden of

10

coming in in a section 2 case, which is, after all, a

11

claim that the State is forced to draw a district in a

12

particular way, to show the demonstration district in

13

which the three Gingles factors can be met.

14

case is a little bit unusual in that instead of coming

15

up with a -- a new district, they've just pointed to

16

the old district, which in itself is -- is similar to

17

more of a section 5 claim.

18

And this

But with respect to that district, the

19

district court failed -- failed to -- the district

20

court found that plaintiffs failed to meet the first

21

Gingles precondition, which is that they could not show

22

in that district that they had the ability to elect the

23

candidate of their choice because African Americans

24

were 22 percent of the population in that district, the

25

third largest racial group, and because other evidence,

south and west region of the State in a claim that they

It found that that district was not effective

because it only had a 50.3 percent citizen voting age

population, and the district court found, based on the

9

testimony that showed that Hispanics have a

comparatively low turnout rate in elections, that a

that the rational, legitimate governmental purpose that

eliminate an anti-majoritarian map drawn by the Federal

found and as the court itself found, that -- the court-

drawn map was not unfair or biased in any way.

not in any way maldistribute voters in a way that --

5

that hurt -- hurt Republicans' chances to elect Members

of Congress.

with the old map was that a minority of voters were

controlling the delegation, that is factually untrue.

So when Mr. Cruz says that the problem

chose to elect moderate to conservative Members of

Congress who happened to be affiliated with the

13

that does not mean that Democrats were controlling the

14

delegation.

15

The anti-majoritarian name is odd in another

16

way because the map that replaced it, of course, is

terribly anti-majoritarian, as the experts for both

sides agreed.

standard analysis about bias in a map to the point

where it locks in 22 to 10 regardless, essentially, of

Now, we've had three States redo their

There's another particular aspect of this

10

that I think is potentially dangerous, which is as you

11

get further into the decade, the census numbers get

older and older and more and more out-of-date.

13

what the line-drawers then do is they've got the census

numbers over here, they know where the real people are

15

over here, and they can exploit that differential using

16

the old census numbers.
