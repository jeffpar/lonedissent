CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Jett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. CRAIG JETT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. JETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case, the parties agree that Federal

11

courts, including this Court, have addressed

12

nonstatutory defenses for almost 200 years and that

13

Congress, in enacting criminal law statutes, legislate

14

against a background of Anglo-Saxon common law, such

15

that a defense of duress was likely contemplated by

16

Congress when it passed the gun control statutes.

17

is, therefore, required that courts apply defenses,

18

such as the duress defense, based on the background

19

principle of construction that the prosecution must

20

prove criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt.

21

It

The Government would have this Court discount

22

the development of over 110 years of common law that

23

has produced a substantial, well-established, well-

24

reasoned majority rule in both State and in Federal

25

courts that places the burden on the Government to

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

disprove the absence of duress once that defense has

2

been raised by the evidence.

3

The development of the majority rule began

4

with this Court's decision in Davis v. United States in

5

1895.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Jett, do I take it,

7

from what you've just said, that you are recognizing

8

this is a question of Federal common law and not due

9

process, so that if Congress placed the burden on the

10

defendant, there would be no constitutional infirmity?

11

You're just arguing that this is the Federal common

12

law?

13

MR. JETT:

Our -- our first issue and our

14

first contention is that Federal common law will govern

15

the decision in this particular case, but we also have

16

a due process point that we also believe is germane.

17

But --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- you -- then you

19

think that Congress could not say that the defendant

20

has the burden on the question of duress.

21

MR. JETT:

We think that Congress could not

22

under the -- the precedents of this Court and under the

23

-- the basic common law construction that's

24

fundamental, I think, to the -- to the criminal law in

25

this -- in this country.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you do with

Martin against Ohio?

3

MR. JETT:

Well, we understand about Martin

4

v. Ohio, Your Honor, and we think that -- that based on

5

recent precedents, Martin v. Ohio should be

6

reconsidered.

7

duress is based on the fact that there -- that there

8

must be free will, and if free will is dispensed with,

9

in this case by duress, then the -- the defendant

The -- the significant issue is that

10

doesn't have the requisite criminal intent.

11

in our -- and since the beginning of -- since before

12

the beginning of common law in -- in our system, it has

13

been recognized that in order to have a criminal -- a

14

crime, there have to be two things:

15

will and the other an act -- an evil act concurrent

16

with the vicious will.

17

And -- and

one, a vicious

And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there may be --

18

there may be crimes where duress would vitiate an

19

intent element, but there may be other crimes where it

20

wouldn't.

21

to be -- is it that in every case duress negates an

22

element of the crime or only in some cases?

23

And -- and I don't understand your argument

MR. JETT:

Well, we think that in -- that in

24

every criminal case, with possibly the exception of --

25

of public welfare cases, that -- that there is an

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

underlying background construction for our criminal

2

law, which requires the Government to prove beyond a

3

reasonable doubt criminal intent.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Which is the easier of the

5

two cases for the defendant?

6

argument is a burden of proof should be on -- on the --

7

the State as a due process matter or a common law

8

matter in an insanity defense and, B, in a duress

9

defense?

10

MR. JETT:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. JETT:

A, the case where the

Which is easier for the State?
Well, either way.

Well, we -- we contend that in a

13

-- a -- duress is -- is different.

14

really the internal workings of somebody's mind, so

15

that's perhaps more difficult for the State.

16

-- in a duress case, you're dealing not only with the

17

internal workings but also external factors as well --

18

as well that impose somebody else's will upon the

19

defendant.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Insanity deals with

But in a

I would think that it's

21

easier in -- you know, we had -- we had a -- this term

22

another case in which the argument is that you cannot

23

have a separate insanity defense essentially and -- and

24

exclude from the mens rea element of a crime the -- the

25

lack of -- of mental capacity to -- to have that mens

This is the same thing you're arguing before us.

And -- and it seems to me that if it applies to

3

duress, it applies even -- even more strongly to -- to

4

insanity.

5

commit a crime that -- that requires mens rea?

6

How can an insane person form the intent to

MR. JETT:

Well, we -- we agree that -- I

7

agree -- we agree that an insane person cannot form

8

that particular intent.

9

except that the duress case is perhaps easier for the

We think that they are similar

10

-- for the defense because we have external factors

11

that often bear on what the defense is unlike --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but we've held, at

13

least under the M'Naghten version of the defense, that

14

the State -- that the burden can be put on the

15

defendant to show that he was not insane under the

16

M'Naghten test.

17
18
19

MR. JETT:

Well, we -- and we understand

that, and again, our -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And as Justice Scalia said

20

and as I was considering in asking my question, in your

21

case we know that there was a conscious, knowing and

22

intentional, in some sense, act when -- when the person

23

bought -- bought the weapons.

24

course, was induced by -- by the threat.

25

me you have a more difficult case than in the insanity

She says the intent, of

case.

2

MR. JETT:

Well, our -- our -- we think that

3

they're -- that they're similar because both deal with

4

-- with the mental state, and -- and then historically,

5

at least since -- since 1895 in this Court, this Court

6

has said that you've got to have the vicious will in

7

order to constitute a crime.

8

issue here.

9

was she acting under the will of someone else?

10
11

And so you have the same

Did Mrs. Dixon have the vicious will or

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but doesn't vicious

will mean simply the will to commit the crime?

12

MR. JETT:

Actually, no.

It means the -- the

13

criminal intent, not just to commit the crime but

14

having the criminal intent, the vicious mind, to

15

violate the law.

16

Mrs. Dixon's --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, what do you mean by

17

vicious?

18

the person is antisocial or asocial?

I mean, that the person is -- is nasty, that

19

MR. JETT:

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21
22

No.
I don't know what the added

element is.
MR. JETT:

The -- this -- this Court has --

23

has frequently equated the vicious will with moral

24

blameworthiness, that is, the desire to do wrong, that

25

is, the desire to do something -- to -- the free desire

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

based on the -- the choice of having -- being able to

2

do the right thing or do the wrong thing and freely

3

choosing to do the wrong thing, that is, moral

4

blameworthiness.

5
6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The phrase Justice Harlan

used in the Davis case.

7

MR. JETT:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, Your Honor.
But when you -- when you say

9

freely choosing, what you mean, I take it, is choosing

10

with -- without consideration of pressure from a third

11

party.

That's what you mean, isn't it?

12

MR. JETT:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MR. JETT:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's correct.
Okay.

Yes, Your Honor.
But if the -- the third --

16

the third party may, indeed, exert pressure, but I take

17

it you would agree that it is still the decision of the

18

defendant whether to cave in to that pressure or not,

19

whether to commit the crime or not to commit the crime.

20

MR. JETT:

21

voluntary act.

22

decision.

23

We believe that would not be a

Certainly the defendant makes that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I -- I don't want to

24

get lost in -- in rhetoric here.

25

case, even on your theory, that the defendant in these

Isn't it still the

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

circumstances makes a choice?

2

choice, a much more difficult choice to make than it

3

would be otherwise, but the defendant still makes a

4

choice as to whether to cave in to the third party's

5

pressure or not, whether to commit the crime or not.

6

Isn't that true even on your theory?

7

MR. JETT:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MR. JETT:

It may be a troubled

Yes, it is true.
Okay.

But the difference is, as you

10

pointed out, Justice Souter, that the defendant is not

11

acting of her own free will.

12

based on the will of someone else, that that person has

13

overborne her will.

She's -- she's acting

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

the will of someone else.

16

somebody else for her making the choice.

17

MR. JETT:

It was her will to yield to
I mean, you can't blame

Well, we -- we would respectfully

18

disagree, Judge.

19

figuratively a gun at the head of her children, and if

20

somebody puts a gun to the head of my child, you can

21

make me do almost anything that you want.

22

She believed that there was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That may be a very

23

intelligent choice on your part to do what the person

24

with the gun at the head of your children tells you to

25

do.

But to say that it's not your choice, which is

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

what you're arguing here, the only question is whether

2

that has to be brought forward by reason of -- of a

3

defense of -- of coercion or rather, whether it goes to

4

whether you had the intent. That's all we're talking

5

about here.

6

yield to -- to the demand of whoever has the gun at the

7

head of your children.

8

whether the law should punish your yielding like that.

9

And it seems to me you have the intent to

MR. JETT:

10

It's a separate question

Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- but you're telling us

11

that you don't have the intent to -- to yield and --

12

and to do whatever criminal act that person tells you.

13

Right? That just doesn't -- I just don't think it's

14
15

true.
MR. JETT:

What -- what we're saying and what

16

I think that this Court -- the precedents of this Court

17

have said is that you have to have criminal intent.

18

That is the vicious will that -- that the Court --

19

Justice Harlan talked about in Davis and this Court has

20

talked about in Morissette.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what is the statutory

22

-- what is the mens rea under the statute for the

23

offenses that the defendant was charged with?

24

knowingly, isn't it?

25

MR. JETT:

It's

Well, on -- on seven or eight of

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the counts, it's knowingly.

2

first count it's knowingly, but that is defined as --

3

as -- in this case, it was defined as voluntarily and

4

intentionally.

5

simply defined as knowingly.

6

that's -- that is what the Congress said.

7

Well, actually on the

And then in the other counts, it was
And so, indeed, that --

However, based on the -- the precedents of

8

this Court, that even when there is a knowingly

9

culpable mental state provided by Congress, this Court

10

has impart -- imported the -- the criminal intent to --

11

into the statute.

12

Morissette, which was a theft case, what this Court did

13

was the Congress had said knowingly didn't provide a --

14

a criminal intent.

15

that the Court -- that the Government had to prove that

16

beyond a reasonable doubt.

17

raised, it became an element that the Government has to

18

prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so like in -- for instance, in

So this Court imported one and said

Once the defense was

Well, counsel, under

20

your view, how -- how is the Government supposed to

21

prove a negative in every case?

22

to prove the absence of duress?

How are they supposed

MR. JETT:

24

25

It's really no different than any

to prove that -- disprove self-defense beyond a

same way they do in the other case.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They do it in the

The -- the other guy had a

Duress is something that in this case the

12

Government would have no reason to suppose that it was

13

even implicated until it's raised, and then they have

14

no way of getting at what the particulars are because

15

they're all within the control of the defendant.

16

MR. JETT:

17

disagree with that.

18

example of -- of that -- of that circumstance.

19

Government -- early on in this case, they searched Mrs.

20

Dixon's apartment and found evidence.

21

interviewed her.

22

prior to trial before we gave them notice.

23

they were able to investigate her background partially

24

before we gave notice, partially afterwards, so that

25

they were able to -- to investigate her and

2

were able to call as witnesses the seven gun dealers

from which the guns were purchased who witnessed the

purchase and who did provide testimony that she did not

circumstance where that would be hard, but in very many

9

cases, the facts are there just like a self-defense

10

You can certainly imagine a

case or, for that matter, just like --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I thought the

12

gist of her duress defense was not that she was under

13

duress when she was purchasing the guns, but that she

14

had reason to believe that her children were being

15

threatened by accomplices or associates of -- of this

16

-- this individual.

17

of the -- the scene that would lead the Government to

18

have any access to that evidence.

19

MR. JETT:

And there's nothing in the facts

Well, what -- what she was in

20

duress about is she was told at the time that there was

21

somebody at home with a gun who was just a cell phone

22

call away.

23

somebody there with a gun to the head of her children

24

and she was in fear of her children's life.

25

So as far as she was concerned, there was

In terms of what -- what the Government knew

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in this particular case, the Government had notice.

2

The trial judge required that we provide notice of a

3

defense.

4

that if we had an expert, we had to give the Government

5

notice of the expert and the subject matter of the

6

testimony of the expert.

7

well informed prior to trial what the defense was so

8

that they hired their own expert who actually was able

9

to interview the -- the accused without me being there

10

and -- and so was prepared to testify about the issues

11

of duress.

12

The trial judge required that if we -- said

So the Government was very

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what is the

13

threshold test that the defendant has to cross before

14

the judge will give the instruction to the jury?

15

Obviously, the burden of production is with the

16

defendant.

17

-- this is just too flimsy for a duress defense?

18

not going to instruct a jury on that.

19

When can a judge say, well, you know, this

MR. JETT:

I'm

Well, the -- the first thing the

20

judge would have to determine is that has -- has there

21

been evidence of each of the elements of duress, and

22

the trial judge found that we -- we've produced evidence

23

of each of the elements of the duress.

24
25

The -- in -- in the circuit court cases,
they've not been consistent, but we would -- we would

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

suggest that the -- the standard would be that there

2

would be sufficient evidence, when viewed in the light

3

most favorable to the defendant, that would raise a

4

reasonable doubt with a rationale jury, sort of the --

5

the other side of -- of the prosecution's burden that

6

they have to reach in order to get to the jury.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the -- the

8

methodology that you think we should follow in

9

determining where the burden should be allocated under

10

any particular criminal statute?

11

majority rule at the time when that particular statute

12

was enacted or at -- is it -- you don't think it's the

13

-- the old common law rule.

14

what point of time do we look at the -- at what's going

15

on throughout our country?

16

MR. JETT:

Is it the -- the

What -- what is the -- at

Well, I think you've got to look

17

at two points in time.

18

don't look at the old common law because -- because

19

there's been 110 years of -- of development of common

20

law in this country since Davis v. United States.

21

think the Court has got to look at -- at what the

22

common law was at the time that the relevant statute

23

was passed, which in this case was 1968.

24
25

And certainly we agree.

We

So I

But I think in addition to that, there -there have been amendments to the statute.

different under different statutes?

3

MR. JETT:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the burden would be

Well -If we were dealing with a --

5

with a much older criminal statute, the burden might be

6

allocated differently?

7

MR. JETT:

No, because I think the -- I think

8

you have to consider that.

9

have to consider is the development of the common law

But the other thing you'd

10

since that time and what -- what courts have done, what

11

the rationale has been that they have employed over

12

time.

13

And in this particular case, for instance, we

14

have -- we have six Federal circuits and 29 States who

15

have found that the burden of proof -- the burden of

16

production should be on the defendant, but the burden

17

of persuasion should be on -- on the Government to

18

disprove duress once it's raised.

States have not addressed the issue.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Some

Well, that's -- that's sort

4

of a horse race.

5

with your theory, that -- that what the Constitution

6

requires changes on the basis of an evolving common

7

law.

8
9

I'm -- I'm not sure, even if I agreed

Of course, it can only change in one
direction.

Right?

It can only change favorably to --

10

to your client, favorably to the defendant.

11

change to be more harsh to the defendant because the

12

Constitution prohibits that.

13

MR. JETT:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

It can't

We would agree -Right?

So -- so we have a

one-way -- a one-way altering Constitution.

16

MR. JETT:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -But even -- even if I agreed

18

with that, I'm not sure that, you know, 21 versus 14 is

19

-- is an overwhelming demonstration of -- of the new

20

common law.

21
22

MR. JETT:
versus 14.

But, Justice Scalia, it's 29

And -- but it's --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MR. JETT:

25

29 versus 14.

But it's clearly a 2 to 1 majority

in favor of placing the burden of persuasion on the

Government.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But are you making

3

the argument that this number indicates a congressional

4

intent and that what we ought to do is come up with a

5

rule because Congress intended it?

6

the argument that yours is the better rule, and as a

7

matter of common law, which -- which it is our

8

responsibility to develop, we should see it your way?

9

Which argument are you making?

10

MR. JETT:

Or are you making

We're -- we're basing our argument

11

primarily on -- on the common law that has been

12

developed in -- in this country since really Davis v.

13

United States through the present and has -- has --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Jett, there's one

15

piece of this picture that's different -- that

16

distinguishes duress from, say, self-defense.

17

self-defense, you take a snapshot on the scene.

18

know exactly what happened.

19

these gun purchases would have any idea of all of this.

20

And the judge, when asked to give -- to allow

If it's
You

No one taking a picture of

21

the defense of duress, said, it's frankly a close call

22

in my mind, but when it is a close call, better give it

23

than not.

24
25

Now, he thought that the defendant would have
the burden of proof.

Perhaps the judge would call that

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

close question the other way if he thought he was

2

saddling the prosecution with the ultimate burden of

3

persuasion.

4

MR. JETT:

In my mind it would be -- if it's

5

a close question, I don't think the burden of proof in

6

that particular circumstance would make a difference

7

because it still is -- because he would then be taking

8

it away from the jury.

9

are -- are not want to take the questions away from the

10

jury, and they will provide the -- the jury instruction

11

in a close case.

12

do because ultimately we want the jury to make that

13

decision.

14

And in my experience, judges

And that would be the right thing to

But the -- but the judge does have a

15

gatekeeping function in -- in a duress defense, so that

16

a judge -- in any circumstance, if the judge decided

17

that the evidence was insufficient to get to the jury,

18

the judge can make that determination so that you have

19

the trial court acting with the -- the -- to make sure

20

that what the jury is going to hear is -- is an issue

21

for which there is evidence.

22

gatekeeping function that the trial court would --

23

would prevent there from being -- juries making a

24

decision on insufficient facts.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So I think that the

Mr. Jett, a thought occurred

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to me, by reason of your agreement, that -- that it's a

2

one-way ratchet, that when the common law changes in

3

the -- in the direction of favoring the defendant, it

4

becomes the duty of the courts to allow that.

5

course, it can't change in the other direction because

6

the Constitution would prevent it.

7

with that.

8
9

But, of

You sort of agreed

But -- but if -- if you agree with that, how
can you explain our -- our 1895 decision in Davis which

10

held that the insanity defense had to be proved by the

11

Government which was then overridden by a Federal

12

statute.

13

right about what the -- what the common law required,

14

how could Congress possibly have changed that by a

15

statute?

16

of the common law are picked up in the Due Process

17

Clause.

18

-- of proving the mental element of a -- of a crime,

19

even when that mental element is overcome by insanity,

20

why wouldn't that have been embodied in the Due Process

21

Clause so that the congressional statute would have

22

been ineffective?

23

How could -- how could -- if -- if Davis was

I would assume that all of the basic elements

Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't the necessity of

MR. JETT:

Well, two reasons.

One, Davis was

24

a common law case, and -- and subsequently in Leland v.

25

Oregon, this Court said Davis was a common law case.

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And so this Court can decide the common law issue with

2

respect to the Constitution.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

I'm not questioning

4

whether we could do it.

5

Congress could do it, whether Congress could overrule

6

what we did in Davis.

7

was that the Government has to prove -- disprove

8

insanity, wouldn't that have been part -- become part

9

of the Due Process Clause if it was the common law?

10

MR. JETT:

I'm questioning whether

If Davis said that common law

I think -- I think that if it --

11

if it does become part of the Due Process, then

12

obviously Congress cannot overrule it.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. JETT:

Right.

If it simply becomes the common

15

law -- the rule of -- of the Federal courts that this

16

Court has -- has established based on its supervisory

17

powers, then the Congress would be able to do that.

18
19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it makes me suspect

that Davis was wrong.
MR. JETT:

Well, the thing about Davis that

21

even though the -- the insanity holding about Davis was

22

overruled, the core holdings of Davis was not

23

overruled. And one of the things that Davis said was

24

that, again, to constitute a crime against human laws,

25

there must be the vicious will and, secondly, the

22
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

unlawful act.

2

The other thing that Davis said, which was

3

very significant, is that the plea of not guilty is not

4

like in a civil case where there's confession and

5

avoidance.

6

controverts all of the allegations of -- of the State,

7

and so that it controverts the existence of each fact

8

that the State has to prove.

9

does that and what duress does is it negates the evil

What it does is it negates or it

If it -- if it, indeed,

10

-- the evil intent, then -- then the Government has got

11

to prove that there's criminal intent.

12

negate one of the elements that the Government has got

13

to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

14

-- that's part of the holding of Davis, and the

15

Congress has not affected that with its decision on the

16

insanity defense.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's got to

And that's -- that

May I ask, if -- if you

18

know, whether Congress has ever been asked to address

19

this precise issue that we're debating today?

20

MR. JETT:

21

the duress defense.

22

there was a proposal to -- to amend the Federal

23

Criminal Code, and in that particular -- it didn't pass

24

but I think the result of that was that Congress just

25

took out the duress provision and said that the courts

Congress has -- has never ruled on
I think a few years ago, there --

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

should make the decision as to how that would be

2

handled based on -- on all the -- the normal

3

considerations that a court looks at in making those

4

decisions.

5

So that the Congress has had many

6

opportunities to rule on duress.

7

like the Congress has said you have to have notice of

8

alibi and just like they passed the -- this -- the rule

9

about -- I mean, the statute about insanity.

The Congress -- just

The

10

Congress could have -- have abolished the duress

11

defense.

12

constitutionally, but they could have passed a statute

13

and spoken to that, but they've chosen not to.

14

think what that tells us is that the Congress is

15

probably aware of the common law and have chosen not to

16

interfere with the development of the common law in

17

this country.

18

I don't think they could have

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about a defense

23

Does the Government have to disprove that as

MR. JETT:

If that is a defense that is

24

recognized by -- by the common law or -- or by statute,

25

then the Government would have to do that if that

MR. JETT:

Well, the Government could do that

much the way they do like in an entrapment defense.

10

an entrapment defense, the Government has to -- once

11

there's entrapment shown, the Government has to

12

disprove the predisposition of the defendant or prove

13

the defendant has predisposition.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In

And so --

But that's based on the

15

defendant's -- the prosecution's conduct.

Government behaved.

18

MR. JETT:

The

Justice Ginsburg, it does but it

19

still -- that case still deals with somebody overriding

20

the will of the defendant, the Government imposing its

21

own will on the defendant.

22

In that regard --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if the Government is

23

out there trying to achieve that result, it's quite

24

different from the Government having nothing to do --

will of the accused.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10
11

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

For three reasons, the burden of proving

13

duress should be on the defendant, and the Government

14

should not be required to disprove duress beyond a

15

reasonable doubt.

16

First, duress is an affirmative defense that

17

excuses what would otherwise be serious criminal

18

conduct.

19

has engaged in criminal conduct and has done so with

20

the mens rea specified by the crime, it is fair to

21

require the defendant to prove that duress excuses that

22

criminal conduct, so that here, the Government proved

23

that Petitioner knew she was lying when she filled out

24

the forms and that she knew it was unlawful for her to

25

receive firearms.

When the Government proves that a defendant

26
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So there may be cases

2

where the nature of the mens rea required would require

3

the Government to disprove duress.

4

MR. GORNSTEIN:

5

such cases, Mr. Chief Justice.

6
7
8

There could conceivably be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The sort of crimes

where -- where your culpability depends on your motive.
Right?

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, if you had a crime, for

10

example, that said someone who does something while not

11

under -- acting under duress, that would be an obvious

12

example.

13
14

But there are -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It would be an easy

example.

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It would be an easy example.

But there -- there are -Good catch.
What about a -- you

20

know, a hate crime, a bias crime, you know, an act of

21

violence done with a particular motive or intent?

22

the -- and the suggestion is I didn't do this because

23

of a particular motive.

24

gun to the head of my children.

25

MR. GORNSTEIN:

And

I did this because they had a

Right.

In -- in that kind of

27
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

situation, the facts that go to duress could also go to

2

undermining the proof of the motive in that case, and

3

in that situation, the Government always has to prove

4

the element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

5

But if the defendant wants to add to that a duress -- a

6

specific duress defense, then the burden of proof would

7

be on the defendant to prove duress.

8

that --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, normally in

The Government wouldn't --

10

wouldn't have to disprove duress in the hate case.

11

would just have to prove hate.

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Correct.
And to the extent that

14

duress undermines that, it would be a defense

15

considered by the jury on the hate question.

16
17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's correct, Justice

Scalia.

18

Now, the --

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20
21

It

How does self-defense fit

into this equation?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

The Government's position is

22

that on self-defense, the burden of proof is on the

23

defendant, but it recognizes that there are important

24

distinctions between self-defense and duress that could

25

allow the court to reach different conclusions about

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the two defenses.

2

In addition to the point that's already been

3

made about the degree of factual overlap between self-

4

defense on the one hand and duress on the other on the

5

basic crime, there are three additional considerations.

6

One is that the -- the circuits and the

7

States are virtually uniform on self-defense, whereas

8

there is a significant division of authority on the

9

question of duress.

10

Second, self-defense has always been a more

11

favored defense because when the defendant acts

12

legitimately in self-defense, he's not harming an

13

innocent person.

14

under -- acting under duress, that defendant is still

15

endangering or harming innocent third parties.

16

But when a defendant is actually

And the third reason is that there's always

17

been a significant degree of judicial skepticism about

18

claims of duress, but there's never been that same kind

19

of judicial skepticism about self-defense.

20

So while we do take the position that the

21

burden of proof is still on the defendant, the Court

22

could take a different view on that issue and agree

23

with us on duress.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why is the number of

decisions -- number of States that have gone one way or --

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

or the other on the issue relevant?

2

Amendment question -

3

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No.

If it's not an Eighth

I -- I think it's just a

4

Federal common law question here, and it's only as good

5

as the reasoning that underlies it.

6

to see a uniform body or a consensus of opinion on one

7

side of the equation, then there -- it's much more

8

likely that there are certain reasons that are

9

underlying that justify it.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But when you start

What -- what if you're a

11

judge like me who -- who thinks that any significant

12

element of -- of the criminal law, when the Due Process

13

Clause was -- was adopted, remains in effect and it

14

doesn't change with the times as you seem -- as your

15

last comment seems to have said?

case like Davis?

Davis?

when the Due Process Clause was adopted.

20

What do I do with a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. GORNSTEIN:

-- that this was the common

23

law when the Due Process Clause was adopted.

24

took the position that the common law had evolved to

the point where on the specific defense of insanity,

should be a burden of production on the defendant, and

beyond a reasonable doubt.

5

constitutional holding.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I'll have to go back and

look at it.

But Davis was not a

MR. GORNSTEIN:

-- the early common law was

--

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Okay.
-- because it's clear that

16

under -- at the time of the Constitution, the burden of

17

proof on all of these defenses was on the defendant.

18

And that was also true at the time the Fourteenth

19

Amendment was adopted.

20

defendant.

21

The burden of proof was on the

There was some evolution after that.
Now, the -- the other thing I wanted to talk

22

about with respect to Davis is it was based on the

23

understanding that the Court had about the relationship

24

between the insanity defense on the one hand and the

25

mens rea element of the crime on the other hand.

And

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

here, there's simply no corresponding overlap.

2

or not the Petitioner acted under duress, she knew she

3

was lying when she filled out the forms, and she knew

4

it was unlawful for her to purchase firearms.

5

there's simply no relationship between the duress

6

defense and the mens rea element of these crimes.

7

Whether

So

Congress has also overruled Davis by statute,

8

and we don't think it would be appropriate for the

9

Court to extend Davis to a new defense when Congress

10

has rejected it with respect to the only defense that

11

it applied to.

12

Congress acted constitutionally in overruling the Davis

13

decision under this Court's decision in Leland and in

14

other cases like Martin and Patterson, which say that

15

there is no constitutional problem in putting the

16

burden of proof on the defendant for established common

17

law affirmative defenses.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

And -- and there's -- and certainly

And -Is -- is -- I didn't mean to

cut you off.

20

MR. GORNSTEIN:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.
I was -- you have a tougher

22

argument, don't you, when you -- when you face the

23

comparison between duress here and entrapment because

24

it's -- it's quite true in -- in entrapment you're

25

talking about the actions of a -- of a third party

32
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

which is causing something, but the -- the ultimate

2

determination that has to be made is a determination

3

about the -- in effect, the -- the inclination, the

4

willingness, the readiness of the defendant to have

5

committed the act.

6

it's assumed that so far as the entrapment defense is

7

concerned, the burden is on the Government.

8

burden is on the Government in what is a -- a somewhat

9

difficult issue for the Government to carry the burden

And -- and yet, I take it, it's --

So if the

10

on in entrapment, wouldn't coherence suggest that a

11

fortiori it ought to be on -- on duress?

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No, and here's the reason.

The -- the burden of proof on entrapment is actually on

the defendant initially.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

The burden of proof on

That is, there are two

persuasion.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

Burden of persuasion on the

23

element of inducement is on the defendant.

24

defendant has to prove more likely than not that the

25

Government induced this crime in the sense that it took

2

person would have done.

3

shifts to the Government to show that this particular

4

defendant was predisposed.

5

At that point, the burden

Now, that's consistent with background common

6

law principles under which, once it's shown that one

7

party has been engaging in wrongful conduct, i.e.,

8

inducement, then the burden shifts to the wrongdoer to

9

show that its conduct did not have its likely effect in

10

that case.

11

come back and show that with respect to this particular

12

individual, that particular individual was predisposed,

13

even though we took wrongful actions that would have

14

induced an innocent person to do this.

15

And that's why the Government then has to

You could almost argue that

the other way.

predisposition that the defendant knows more about it

18

than the Government does.

19

I mean, it -- it seems to me on

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That -- that's true, but

20

again, if it was just a matter of who has access to the

21

the burden shifts to the defendant -- to the Government

that the Government has difficulties in -- in meeting a

Is -- is there any evidence that -- that we

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It -- there is nothing that I

can point you to that shows there is an empirically

17

evidence that the Government is not going to be able to

18

deal with this burden.

19

But what I would say to you is that you

20

should take the same approach that the Court took in

21

The Diana case many years ago, which is it did not want

22

to establish a regime that invites manufactured claims.

the defendant was the only one now alive present.

There are lots of cases like that.

5

Traditionally in the law, I take it, it's

6

been that most instances where the defendant excuses

his conduct on the ground he wasn't morally culpable,

mistake, accident, self-defense.

that's a different kind of ground.

Now, I've listed about four things here that
I'd like your response to.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

Let -- let me start with -- I

4

go back to The Diana case because I think the way the

5

Court approached the question in The Diana case is the

6

way this Court should approach it because it dealt with

7

the same kind of defense, necessity.

8

wanted -- it said this is a defense where there is a

9

there is a big danger that this can be manufactured in

And what it

10

a way that it is difficult to disprove, and we are

11

going to establish a regime that doesn't invite

12

manufactured claims and that doesn't make it difficult

13

for the Government to disprove something beyond a

14

reasonable doubt.

15

not the regime we want to establish.

16

establish a regime that makes it more unlikely that

17

manufactured claims are going to come forward and that

18

make it -- makes it more unlikely that if such claims

19

do come forward, the Government isn't going to be able

-- unable to disprove them beyond a reasonable doubt,

21

compromising the entire statutory scheme.

22

We have a choice here, and that's

We want to

may want, and it's something the defense lawyer may not

want.

He has to choose.

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But -So when you get into the

14

practicalities of it, I see things both ways, and I'd

15

like to find some evidence of what's actually happened.

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, take a recent case in

17

which a defendant transported drugs from Mexico into

18

the United States, and he claimed that he did that

19

because someone threatened his family members in

20

Mexico.

21

deliberately violated the law would find relatively

22

easy to manufacture that defense.

23

very difficult for the Government to disprove that

beyond a reasonable doubt.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's true, Justice Breyer,

19

to persuade the jury through cross-examination, that

20

that is more -- not more likely than not.

21

another thing to persuade the jury in that kind of

situation that that defense is not true beyond a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's quite

the defendant would plead guilty but for the fact that

4

he has a plausible coercion defense, and so he puts

that coercion defense before the jury, and oh, sure, he

way we could really tell what the consequences are, as

The -- the burden of -- the

presumption of innocence, though, only applies to the

essential elements of the crime under this Court's

decision in In re Winship, et cetera, and not -- it

13

doesn't apply to affirmative defenses, as the Court has

14

consistently held in Martin and in Patterson and in

15

Leland.

16

you can put the burden of proof on the defendant to

17

prove an affirmative defense, and the Constitution has

nothing to say about that.

19

innocence goes to all the things -- the essential

20

elements of the crime.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

-- the Model Penal Code said

that it was expanding the common law defense of duress

10

to a new place where it had never been.

11

surprising that it would also have a different burden

12

of persuasion than the traditional burden of

13

persuasion.

So it's not

14

Now, on -- on the practice of the States, the

don't think that the Court should do that kind of nose

2

counting based on whether a statute was enacted in

1800, 1850, 1900, 1950 and potentially have different

4

rules for each statute.

5

look at the entire --

6

We think that the Court should

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, why not?

Isn't it

7

realistic to assume that Congress looked at the state

8

of the law at the time it's passing a statute and

9

presumably adopted what was the prevailing view?

10

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I don't think it's right to

11

say that it adopted the prevailing view unless it was a

12

consensus view.

13

I don't think, though --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, a consensus view.

It

14

would still be the time of the enactment of the statute

15

is what would be relevant, I would think.

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But I think the -- I think

17

that the problem with that approach is to have a

18

completely different rule for all the different

19

statutes based on when they were enacted is

20

unmanageable and impractical.

21

the same thing in the context of mens rea requirements.

22

And the Court has said

The Court doesn't import into statutes the

23

mens rea requirement that was in vogue at a particular

24

time.

25

statutes that do not specify a mens rea requirement --

What it does now is it imports into all criminal

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

it simply imports in a knowledge requirement, that

2

there has to be knowing action.

3

regardless of whether it's an 1800 statute, an 1850

4

statute, a 1900 statute, or a today statute.

5

think that the reason for that is one of practicality

6

and administrability which the Court has talked about,

7

in fact, in -- in other cases.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that would be true

curiosity, of the 29 States that have the different

it pronounced by the State supreme court?

13

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I -- I'm not sure of the

14

exact breakdown, but I think that there are -- there

are possibly something like 10 or so States on -- that

But we -- and we -- we would take a step back

12

from that, consistent the practice in the circuits that

have put the burden of proof on the defendant and the

and the burden of proof that -- that Congress has

specified when it has thought about what the burden of

proof should be outside the context of insanity --

put a burden on the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt

for entrapment, duress, insanity?

For all of the affirmative

defenses, I think that's the -- the Leland decision

Yes.

Beyond a reasonable

doubt and so that there is -- there would be no

constitutional problem in putting a -- a burden beyond

5

a reasonable doubt on the duress defense either.

6

And in fact, this is a defense that Congress

7

could -- could eliminate altogether, if it wanted to,

8

and just take the position that it's going to -- these

9

-- this kind of excuse would be considered along with

10

all other kinds of excuses in either making a charging

11

decision or -- or making a sentencing decision.

is no constitutional imperative that there be a duress

considered, along with other excuses, in -- by

1

no State has ever taken that position and the Congress

2

hasn't taken that position, and it would be very much

3

against all the traditions that are -- that we have.

4

But if a State made a policy judgment to that effect,

5

that this is the policy -- we want to encourage people

6

to retreat, we do not want to encourage people to take

7

the law into their own hands, but what we will do is we

8

will recognize this and we are sure our prosecutors are

9

going to recognize it, we're sure our judges are going to

10

recognize it as a -- a mitigating factor.

would be constitutional.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mistake is -I thought it was a deer.
Yes.

Mistake is something

4

that negatives the mens rea requirement of knowledge.

5

So, of course, the Government has to prove knowledge

6

beyond a reasonable doubt, and if somebody has mistake,

7

then the Government isn't going to be able to satisfy

8

its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And would you distinguish

10

between instances of duress where it may a negative

11

mens rea and instances where it may not?

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, if it does negative

13

mens rea -- and this is infrequent, but if it does,

14

then the Government, of course, has to prove its

15

element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

16

if duress evidence undermines the Government's ability

17

to do that, then the Government hasn't proven its case

beyond a reasonable doubt.

the sentiment, but she was -- she was threatened by
