ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court of Appeals decision in this case

12

carves out an exception to the categorical prohibition for

13

the Controlled Substances Act in order to permit

14

respondents to import, distribute, and use a Schedule 1

15

controlled substance.

16

exception was justified by the Religious Freedom

17

Restoration Act in order to enable respondents to use

18

hoasca tea, which contains dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, in

19

the substance, for religious purposes.

20

appeals was wrong.

21

interest test, as set forth in prior Federal court

22

decisions.

23

The Court of Appeals believed this

The court of

RFRA carries forward the compelling-

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

May I address a preliminary

24

inquiry that I have?

25

of the injunction by the trial court?

Are we reviewing here the issuance

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, a preliminary injunction.
And we have to find that, for

3

the trial court to have issued it, it was an abuse of

4

discretion?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, with respect to certain

6

aspects of the preliminary injunction question, yes.

7

example, whether a preliminary injunction should -- is the

8

proper remedy if all the other criteria are satisfied.

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

For

You know --

But --- the court found evidence

12

in equipoise and so on and so forth, so I just wondered,

13

at the bottom line, what our legal standard is here.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

We believe that the Court

15

of Appeals erred -- or District Court and Court of Appeals

16

erred, as a matter of law, in entering the injunction --

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

Abused its discretion.

Well, abused -- a court always

19

abuses its discretion if it -- if it commits a legal

20

error.

21

So, that is basically our position here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me your position

22

is that you must -- we must give controlling determinative

23

weight to the fact that it's listed in Schedule 1.

24

the respondents say you don't give it any weight at all,

25

it's all on a case-by-case basis.

And

Is there a middle

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

ground that there -- which I think would allow you to

2

prevail here -- that there is a presumption that there is

3

a compelling governmental interest when it's in Schedule

4

1?

5

that, when it's in Schedule 1, it's a compelling interest.

It's a rebuttable presumption, but it's a presumption

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

Well -The --

-- first of all, our principal

submission is that Congress's designation in Schedule 1 is

10

sufficient unto itself.

11

submission that, if the Court didn't disagree with that,

12

that Congress's -- Congress, in Schedule 1, has said that

13

any mixture containing any amount of a listed

14

hallucinogenic substance is barred.

15

question that this substance contains that.

16

Court was going to look beyond that to the facts of this

17

case, there's also no question in this case that

18

respondents' use of the substance produces the very

19

effects that led Congress to put the substance on Schedule

20

1.

21

would be in direct derogation of Congress's judgment.

22

But we also do include a further

And there's no
But if the

So, to allow the -- to allow the substance to be used

The disagreement, such as there is, goes not to

23

the -- not to that question.

24

the joint appendix -- or the petition appendix.

25

District Court specifically found that those effects are

And that's on page 214(a) of
The

produced.

2

essentially that those effects shouldn't matter, or that

3

those effects should be ignored.

4

inconsistent with Congress's judgment.

5

if you go beyond the text of the statute, it shouldn't be

6

for anything more than to -- for the Court to assure

7

itself that the effects that caused Congress to list the

8

subject, in fact, occur, and --

9
10

Respondents' argument in the lower courts was

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we think that that's
So, my point is,

Mr. Kneedler -Well, but part of the statute

11

is Sherbert and Verner and the test that Congress says we

12

have to apply to its acts here.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

But under -- the Act does

14

say carry forward the prior Federal court decisions.

15

prior to Smith, this Court, on a number of occasions, had

16

recognized the compelling interest in uniform enforcement

17

of important statutes that could not function under a

18

system of individualized religious --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But,

Mr. --

-- exemptions.
-- Mr. Kneedler, I think

22

everyone would concede that there is a compelling

23

interest, governmental interest, to have the Controlled

24

Substances Act on that level, yes.

25

passed another statute that says all laws shall be subject

But then, Congress has

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to RFRA -- shall be subject to RFRA.

2

look at "Is there a compelling State interest for the

3

controlled Substances Act?" in a vacuum.

4

what was a later statute, RFRA, to which the Controlled

5

Substances Act is made subject by Congress.

6

the argument was: Is there a compelling State interest in

7

that context?

8

peyote and, "We're just like the Native American Church in

9

that regard"?

10

So, we can't just

We have to take

And I thought

How can there be, given the situation with

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the argument is not that

11

the Controlled Substances Act is not subject to RFRA.

12

is subject to RFRA.

13

First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause -- and, in this

14

Court's pre-Smith cases, in which the Court -- at least

15

Congress understood the Court to have been applying a

16

compelling-interest test, the Court was applying that

17

compelling-interest test to particular statutes under

18

which individualized religious exemptions would not be

19

feasible, and held, as a categorical matter, that they

20

were not required.

21

the laws against polygamy, the Sunday closing laws, all

22

are -- all of those are ones in which the Court had

23

previously concluded that individualized exceptions were

24

not appropriate.

25

It

But -- just as it was subject to the

The Social Security Act, the tax code,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I would understand that if

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the Government had acted uniformly.

2

situations that seem to be like -- the peyote and this

3

case.

4

not to the other?

5

But we do have two

And if the Government must accommodate to one, why

MR. KNEEDLER:

In the peyote exception, Congress

6

was acting under its distinct constitutionally recognized

7

authority with respect to Indian tribes.

8

Commerce Clause specifically authorizes Congress to

9

legislate with respect to Indian tribes --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Indian

It's --- as -But it still shows -- whatever

13

power they were -- they were proceeding under, it still

14

shows that it's not all that important that nobody be able

15

to use a substance banned by category 1.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean --

Well, I --- whatever power it was under,

18

it's a demonstration that you can make an exception

19

without the sky falling.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I, in no way, think that

21

Congress believed that by enacting the special provision

22

for Indian tribes, it was thereby opening the Controlled

23

Substances Act to individualized --

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well --- religious exceptions.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

2

that.

3

wrong with the argument?

4

-- maybe Congress didn't assume

They probably didn't think about it.

MR. KNEEDLER:

But what's

Well, I think what's wrong with

5

the argument is that what Congress did with respect to

6

Indian tribes was take a look at that distinct context and

7

conclude that, for a variety of reasons -- and,

8

particularly, respecting the autonomous authority of an

9

independent Indian tribe to control its internal affairs

10

this exception applies only to members of recognized

11

Indian tribes -- that, in that context, balancing all of

12

the relevant considerations -- not the sort of balance

13

under RFRA --

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

But it --- but balancing all the

16

considerations under the -- its Indian power, concluded

17

there was --

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But Justice Scalia's point is,

19

no matter what the legal theory, the evidence, historical

20

evidence, seems to indicate that the sky didn't fall.

21

if it didn't fall for the larger number of Native

22

Americans involved who use peyote, and the very small

23

number using this drug, can't we, kind of, think that at

24

least, "Well, maybe it's not all that compelling"?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

And

But that was -- that was a

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

specific judgment made by Congress itself, looking at --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Kneedler, may I --

-- all the factors.
-- may I stop you --

Yes.
-- there?

Because, correct

7

me if I'm wrong, but it was my impression that the DEA was

8

allowing an exemption for peyote use by the Native

9

American Church before Congress passed the law.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

That -- that's correct, but that

11

was understood at the -- at -- back in 1970, or back,

12

actually, in '65, when that was first adopted, to have

13

been consistent with Congress's original intent in passing

14

the statute, and the Controlled Substances Act, which

15

carried forward the schedules.

16

Congress has now addressed the subject by statute,

17

following the enactment of RFRA, following this Court's

18

decision in Smith, and which has brought things into quite

19

different focus.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, in any event,

But if you take it that the

21

Government was right -- before Congress passed the law,

22

the Government was right to give the exemption to allow

23

that ceremonial use of peyote, then I don't see how you

24

get mileage from a congressional act that was passed later

25

than Congress's is saying, "Executive, we agree with you,

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you did right."

2

you can rely on the congressional statute when the

3

Government was doing this even without a --

But it's not -- you -- I don't see how

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, and --- congressional statute.

-- the statute actually, you

7

know, now gives some firm statutory basis for that

8

exception, which may not really have existed so

9

comfortably after this Court's decision in Smith.

And

10

there was, it's true, nothing specific in the statute

11

before.

12

the sort of claim that respondents are arguing for here is

13

that it would turn over to 700 district judges a

14

determination based on particular records, particular

15

credibility determinations, the judgment as to whether --

The critical point, though, to bear in mind for

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

what the Act does?

MR. KNEEDLER:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

-- an exception --- isn't that exactly the --

That's --

20

24

Yes, but --

No --- why they passed it.
With all respect -And that's why we came out the

other way in Smith, by the way.
MR. KNEEDLER:

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

[Laughter.]

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- but even when Congress went

3

back to pre-Smith, again Congress recognized that there

4

are certain statutes in -- that serve a compelling

5

interest that would be undermined by individualized

6

determinations, and the Controlled --

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, it didn't --

-- Substances Act --- say that, did it?

I mean,

10

it did seem to indicate, after the passage of RFRA, courts

11

are supposed to examine, in each case, whether there is a

12

compelling State interest and whether it's closely enough

13

related.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

But it -- but that was the test

15

that the Court was applying, as Congress understood it,

16

prior to Smith, in which, I repeat, the Court said there

17

were certain statutes that categorical judgments could be

18

made about.

19

statute, as this Court recognized in Raich and in Oakland

20

Cannabis --

And the Controlled Substances Act is such a

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I want you --

-- where the Court --- to stay on this point,

24

because it's important, but if this were a Schedule 2

25

substance, would your argument be the same?

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Our argument would be the same,

2

but for an additional reason there, and that is that even

3

where Congress has -- or even where a substance may be

4

distributed and used, it is only for medical purposes,

5

which is in furtherance of, not in derogation of, the

6

health and safety purposes of the statute.

7

it is done to very strict -- pursuant to very strict

8

controls that are really incompatible with sacramental use

9

of a substance.

And even then,

There is a requirement of prescription,

10

or dispensing by a physician under physician control, with

11

recordkeeping -- identifying the dosage, the amount of the

12

sacrament -- recordkeeping of the person who takes it.

13

There is -- there is an incompatibility and potential

14

entanglement problem in how to -- in trying to apply a

15

system like that, even under Schedule 2.

16

Schedule 1, what you have is contraband, as this Court

17

said --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

But under

But suppose we --- in Raich.
-- I grant you that

21

administrative considerations are relevant.

22

they're relevant.

23

determinative.

24

said, absolutely relevant in deciding the compelling

25

interest, but the fact that peyote seems to have been

Of course

But that's far from saying they're

And then we're back to what Justice Souter

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

administered without the sky falling in suggests that,

2

here, they're not determinative.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's all.

Well, if I could go back to the

4

way the Controlled Substances Act operates, it does not

5

permit a rescheduling or use of a drug based on

6

individualized determinations made by individual Federal

7

District Courts making their own judgment about how

8

serious the risk is.

9

from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2, for example, to allow

If a substance is going to be moved

10

medical use, that is done through a centralized

11

administrative determination involving coordination

12

between the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the

13

Attorney General, in which expert opinions are gotten and

14

a judgment is made, but the judgment is made only if there

15

is an accepted medical use.

16

be not -- a consensus, not simply an -- a determination by

17

one religious group or one judge --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In other words, there has to

But --- that something may be so.
-- RFRA overrides all that.
No.

I --

I understand RFRA to be -- to

23

say there can be an exception to all Federal statutes

24

where someone makes a religious objection to compliance

25

and, in the judgment of the court, there's not a

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

compelling State interest in the Government going ahead

2

with the statute.

3

under the drug laws, it seems to me it's subject to this

4

new legislation.

5

So, you know, whatever the scheme was

MR. KNEEDLER:

We're not saying it's not subject

6

to the legislation, but in deciding how the compelling

7

interest applies under the statute -- just as under the

8

First Amendment itself, before RFRA was passed, and the

9

one is to replicate the other -- the court -- there were

10

certain statutes, when the court looked at the way they

11

operated and what was necessary to their effectuation, the

12

court said that individualized exceptions would not be

13

feasible.

14

reason to disbelieve --

15
16
17
18
19

And there's no reason to believe, and every

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, when you talk

about -MR. KNEEDLER:

-- that Congress meant to put

that to one side.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- reasons to believe

20

and disbelieve, we don't have to make a once-and-for-all

21

determination, do we?

22

what's going to happen if this exception is granted.

23

if some of those things come true, can't this issue be

24

revisited?

25

RFRA, you're not saying it's a compelling-interest test.

A lot of your concerns talk about
Now,

I don't regard -- maybe I'm wrong, but, under

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

It may be -- may not be satisfied in this case, but if it

2

turns out there's a lot of diversion of the hallucinogen

3

or the membership of the church expands in a way that

4

leads you to believe it's being abused, I mean, then you'd

5

look at it again, right?

6
7

MR. KNEEDLER:

I have several responses to that.

That sort of approach, putting to the test basically a

8

congregation-by-congregation -- or denomination-by-

9

denomination, to use familiar terms -- test about whether

10

a -- an exception should be recognized for a particular

11

religion, itself, presents difficult questions.

12

if you have a particular religious sect that believes that

13

it is -- that it is important to invite everyone to the

14

table -- not simply a closed group that has gone through

15

screening, but a -- but everyone to their table --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

If you --

But that --- that would be -- but that

18

would -- that -- the -- a court would be in a judgment

19

about -- in saying that that --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Couldn't have said it better.

21

And that's what we said in Smith.

22

like Smith and has enacted this statute obviously to undo,

23

to the extent it can, the effect of our judgment in

24

Smith.

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

But Congress didn't

No, what -- it did not seek

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to undo the judgment in Smith.

2

Congress was responding to was the -- what it understood

3

to be the test.

4

test, but specifically said it was not disagreeing with

5

the outcome of any particular case under that prior test.

6

What the Court was -- what

It reinstated the compelling-interest

And three of those cases -- Hernandez, concerning the tax

7

code; Lee, concerning the Social Security Act; and

8

Braunfeld, regarding the Sunday closing laws -- were all

9

ones that adopted the approach that I have suggested.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

approach is totally categorical.

12

had, once a year, one drop of the hallucinogen involved

13

here, per member, and it was rigorously policed, your

14

position would still be the same --

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17
18

But your -- but your
If you had a group that

Our --- even applying RFRA,

which sets forth a compelling-interest test.
MR. KNEEDLER:

-- our principal position would

19

be the same.

20

consistent with Justice O'Connor's opinion in Smith, which

21

got a lot of prominence in the subsequent debate about

22

RFRA, because, in that -- in that opinion, even though the

23

compelling-interest test was applied, Justice O'Connor

24

the Court applied the usual standards for the granting of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NANCY HOLLANDER

9

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

10
11
12

MS. HOLLANDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Government's position here, that the Court

13

should completely defer to Congress's generalized finding

14

to wholly exempt Schedule 1 of Controlled Substances Act

15

from RFRA's mandate is fundamentally and structurally

16

incompatible with RFRA.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you seem to give the fact

18

that it's listed in Schedule 1 zero weight.

19

me, at the very least, there should be a presumption that

20

this is a compelling interest.

21

MS. HOLLANDER:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to

Yes, Your Honor, and -And when the -- and when the

23

evidence is in equipoise, as the district judge thought it

24

would, that presumption, it seems to me, carries the day

25

for the Government.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. HOLLANDER:

Your Honor, the District Court

2

-- we give it deference, as did the District Court.

3

Parker specifically found, contrary to what the Government

4

says, that he began by looking at Schedule 1, and he

5

specifically says -- I believe it's on page 212(a) of the

6

petitioner's appendix -- that he had to begin there.

7

he said, "This Court must give due regard for the fact

8

that Congress put DMT into Schedule 1."

9

applied RFRA.

Judge

And

But then he

And in applying RFRA, he went on to apply

10

RFRA and to specifically find that applying RFRA, which

11

requires not only a compelling interest, but a compelling

12

interest to the person, that the Government did not meet

13

its burden in this case of showing harm, any risk of harm,

14

to these members, or any risk of diversion.

15

And I'd like to go back, for a moment, to the

16

issue of peyote, because, first of all, if you look at the

17

congressional record in 1965, for what that's worth,

18

there's not one mention -- and it's on page -- starts on

19

page 480 of the joint appendix -- there's no mention of

20

Indian tribes, there's no mention of sovereign issues with

21

the Indian tribes.

22

American Church and the First Amendment and why this

23

exemption has to be made.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

There's a mention of the Native

And, in fact, our record is -Do we know whether you can be a

member of that church without being an Indian?

MS. HOLLANDER:

know that.

mentions of it, the fact that there have been non-Native-

4

American members since the beginning of the Native

5

American Church.

6

one, which is at the joint appendix at page 500, which is

7

a memo from a DEA legal counsel talking about this.

8

in fact, at the hearing in our case, on the very last day

-- it was on November 2nd, 2001, at page 1933 -- Mr. Adam

And it is throughout our brief.

There's many

Zubin, representing the Government, specifically said, and

I quote, "The Federal Government places no restrictions on

12

who can participate in the Native American Church."

15

So, we have two things.

We have the exemption

in 1965 -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, your theory would be

16

if you had a religious group that -- whose doctrine was

17

that you should proselytize through hoasca, and they want

18

everybody to come, and they're aggressive in doing that,

19

and distributing hoasca, that the Government should be in

20

a position of saying, "This religious group can use it,

21

but that religious group can't"?

22

MS. HOLLANDER:

23

again, on the facts of that case.

Your Honor, it would depend,

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

the -- the ones I just gave you.

Yes, they're the kind of
In other words, if

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there's going to be a greater threat of diversion to --

2

it's not limited to the members of a very cohesive and

3

limited group, but it's -- they're -- they aggressively

4

try to reach out, but it's all part of a sincere religious

5

belief, that we should, in applying RFRA, draw

6

distinctions between the group you represent and that

7

hypothetical group?

8
9

MS. HOLLANDER:

The distinctions -- yes and no,

and let me explain, Your Honor -- Mr. Chief Justice -- the

10

distinction is that if the Government could meet a

11

compelling interest and actually show a risk of diversion

12

--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

different facts.

21

would mean that, in that case, the Government would win.

22

Now, I'd like to point out, although I realize

23

you've just presented me with a hypothetical -- however,

24

there are 250,000 members of the Native American Church,

25

and the record in our case is that there's never been any

evidence of any diversion.

2

has --

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And, although the Government

Well, if we -May I just --- think that the Treaty --

6

the Convention entered into in 1971 -- makes clear that

7

hoasca is covered, then does that provide a compelling

8

interest for the Government, because it requires the

9

Government to prohibit the importation?

10
11

If we think, as a

matter of law, the Convention covers hoasca.
MS. HOLLANDER:

No, Your Honor, it doesn't,

12

because, again, the Government has -- we have to look at

13

the Treaty, just like we look at any other law -- RFRA

14

clearly says --

15

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, if we conclude, looking

16

at the Treaty, that it prohibits hoasca, covers it, and

17

that it provides that nations that enter into the

18

Convention must avoid importation of it, then is that a

19

compelling interest under RFRA?

20

MS. HOLLANDER:

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

22

MS. HOLLANDER:

It may -- yes, Your Honor -It is?

-- it may be a compelling

23

interest, but it still may not satisfy RFRA, because RFRA

24

specifically requires that it be a compelling interest to

25

the person.

And we -- the Government would have to put on

31
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

evidence.

2

doesn't preclude the District Court hearing evidence which

3

he has not heard at -- to this point -- put on evidence

4

showing that the -- that the compelling interest the

5

Government has asserted in this case, which is that it

6

would lose its leadership position in the international

7

community, would really be a compelling interest, and that

8

it could not be accommodating.

9

And even though this is a question of law, that

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that isn't the compelling

10

interest.

11

and you follow it.

12

Government wouldn't have a compelling interest in

13

following a Treaty where they -- where they promised to

14

ban the substance?

15

saying RFRA doesn't apply where that's at stake.

16

what's the argument against that?

17

argument against that is, maybe it really isn't a

18

compelling interest?

19

sounds to me as if it would be.

20

have to live up to their word, period.

21

that?

22

The compelling interest is, we signed a Treaty,

issue, I guess.

-- does it require the Government to go further?

concede that if it doesn't require the Government to go

So, that's a

Why doesn't it?

MS. HOLLANDER:

Why doesn't it?

It doesn't.

10

And the -- and, interestingly, the executive took the

11

reverse position that it's taking here throughout the

12

history of this Treaty until this litigation, and it

13

doesn't cover hoasca, because it doesn't cover plants, or

14

infusions from plants.

15

reason why the U.S. would not lose its leadership position

16

is that that's the position of Brazil, which allows

religious use --

The Treaty that the -- the

language that suggests that exception is, first of all, in

Article 32, that talks about the traditional use of

plants.

And so, a --

It is in the fact that plants are not covered.

15

Tea is a solution, and it includes DMT.

MS. HOLLANDER:

Isn't that

No, Your Honor, it isn't.

And

16

the reason it isn't is, if we look -- several places, one

17

is the conduct of our Treaty partners, none of whom agree

18

with that position -- we look at --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What's wrong -- can you tell

me, on the face of it, what's wrong with it?

if I have tea at 5 o'clock, I think I'm drinking a

solution that includes the little things that come out of

the tea leaves.

And the reason

Peyote is not.

Well, I --

-- American --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

because we made a special reservation for peyote.
MS. HOLLANDER:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

We did

13

make a special reservation, but it didn't matter yet,

14

because it's never been covered.

go back and look at what the Senate said at the time, and

what -- there are no plants.

abundance of caution, in case it would be -- in case it

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there's basically an ambiguity in the Treaty, that

2

solutions derived from plants are not covered, but

3

solutions that include DMT are covered, and there --

4

therefore, there is a question?

5

MS. HOLLANDER:

The -- yes, the ambiguity arises

6

because what the Treaty means is that if you were to

7

extract the DMT and then add it to something, which can't

8

be done here and could have no religious meaning for the

9

UDV, and we're not even sure if -- chemically, if it's

10

possible.

11

you would have a solution containing DMT.

12

If you were to extract it and then add it, then

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that's --

But solution is defined by the

13

number of steps in the process that gets the substance

14

into the water?

Is that --

15

MS. HOLLANDER:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

MS. HOLLANDER:

MS. HOLLANDER:

It's not the clear -- the

3

clearest writing, but we know -- we know what its meaning

4

is, and we do have to look at the travaux, which goes into

5

long detail about why they even mention plants, because of

6

their fear, in the future, that plants might be covered.

7

Now, other plants are covered --

But

--

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can I make a suggestion as to

why, even if it is covered by the Treaty, it may not be a

it well-established that statutes trump treaties, that if

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress decides, in a subsequent statute, to ignore a

Treaty.

Now, if this RFRA can trump a

MS. HOLLANDER:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

It can

trump the Treaty, and that -- and that is --

7

10

Yes, it can, Your Honor.

So, compliance --- correct.
-- with a Treaty is not

necessarily a compelling State interest.
MS. HOLLANDER:

It is not.

And -- but we don't

12

even have to go that far, because, if we do the RFRA

13

analysis, the Government must show a compelling interest

14

to the person and, in addition --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MS. HOLLANDER:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But, surely --- the --- surely RFRA doesn't say

18

that you disregard treaties or you disregard statutes in

19

determining what's a compelling interest.

20
21
22

MS. HOLLANDER:

No.

You don't disregard them,

Your Honor, but -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And getting back to the first

23

question that Justice Breyer asked -- and then we got off

24

on what the Treaty really means -- but assuming that the

25

Treaty does prohibit the importation of this substance --

39
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

assuming that -- is there any evidence that the District

2

Court thought that this was a compelling interest?

3
4

MS. HOLLANDER:

Well, the -- no, the District

Court --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

MS. HOLLANDER:

None at all.
-- analyzed the Treaty

7

differently, and analyzed the Treaty to not apply to

8

hoasca, for all the reasons that are -- that are in his

9

opinion in our brief.

10

And, therefore --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, if we disagree with you on

11

the Treaty, then the appellate court's opinion doesn't

12

really even address the point whether or not this and/or

13

the statute, together, can be a compelling interest.

14

MS. HOLLANDER:

That's correct.

If you disagree

15

with the District Court on that, then the case should be

16

remanded for it to -- for additional --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know if there isn't a

18

factual question here.

19

if it were to be up to him, did take into account official

20

commentaries to treaties.

But maybe he doesn't.

21

I take them into account.

And I -- and in respect to

22

that, I read this as saying, specifically, that the plants

-- it doesn't include the substance if it is a substance

24

clearly distinguished from the substance constituting its

25

active principal -- and the example they give is mimosa

even mimosa roots, where they are imported solely for the

Now, the Government has come in with

purpose of extracting DMT.

11

that?

12

And there's a

MS. HOLLANDER:

Now, what's the response to

The response to that, Your

13

Honor, is that there is no DMT extracted in this case.

14

Although the Government said that in their brief, there is

15

no evidence of that, and it is contrary to the evidence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it has to be

extracted at some point to be -- to get into -- I'm right

you would make tea if you mixed chamomile and mint, and

There's further -- there's further --

And what the

12

And that would be a chemical process.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess I -- if I could

13

just go back to the point.

14

Treaty doesn't cover the importation of plants.

15

you're not importing plants, you're --

You're emphasizing that the

16

MS. HOLLANDER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

That --- importing a mixture

18

that must contain the covered hallucinogen or it doesn't

have its effect.

20

MS. HOLLANDER:

That's correct.

However, under

21

the Treaty, it's not -- it's not covered by the Treaty,

22

because it is not separate.

23

it would be covered by the Treaty.

24

look at the 1988 Treaty, going even farther, and its

25

commentary, the commentary in the 1988 Treaty, which has

So, under your --

-- of the drug.

tea would not be covered by the Treaty.
MS. HOLLANDER:

Not by this Treaty.

But that --

8

marijuana, coca leaves and poppies are specifically

9

covered by the 1961 Treaty.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but they're not

11

being imported, they're transformed into this tea.

12

you -- saying the active substance isn't there

13

independently, so it's not covered.

14

to be a -- an erroneous reading of the Treaty.

15

MS. HOLLANDER:

And

And that seems to me

Well, the difference, for

16

example, with marijuana, is that if you look at the 1961

17

Treaty, it says "the plant, all parts of the plant,

18

everything from the plant."

19

1971 Treaty did was different.

20

Treaty and the 1988 Treaty and their commentaries, if I

21

can rely on their commentaries, and the International

22

Narcotics Control Board, what they are expressing is a

23

concern for the traditional religious and mystical use of

24

plants in religion, and that's what they were concerned

25

about, and that's why they didn't put this in, and that's

It's all covered.

why they specifically have, in the commentary, that the

example of mimosa -- and they also have an example of

peyote in the same paragraph 12, where they --

don't mind using them for treaties, so long as they don't

the language of the Treaty?

11

Do we have any case where we use

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not to my -And that's what, it seems to

me, is going on here.

12

MS. HOLLANDER:

No, Your Honor, it's not

13

contradicting the Treaty, because the Government is taking

14

this one sentence preparation, and the Government has a

15

definition of it, for this litigation only, that is

16

contrary to the definition in the Treaty the way it is

17

interpreted by the travaux and by the commentary, and by

18

this executive, which means that the executive's position

19

here is really entitled to no deference; because,

20

otherwise, the tea drunk by the Native American Church,

21

the peyote tea, would also be covered.

more thing that I've been trying to say, and that is that

RFRA requires not just a compelling interest, but a

compelling interest to the person, and it requires least-

5

restrictive means.

that.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

the Government prove, if it proves a compelling interest,

to enforce it against the person, and if it gets there, it

also must prove that it is furthering that compelling

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now --

But if the interest is

defined, as Mr. Kneedler did -- that is, these drugs are

4

"No, absolutely prohibited." -- then how can you have any

5

less restrictive means?

6

understand your argument about a compelling State interest

7

has to be judged in context -- to the person, to this

church.

9

compelling State interest is that this is a proscribed

10

drug, then there can't be any least restrictive means.

11

It seems to me that you can -- I

a bit tangential just a little bit, but going back to the

suggestion was, if they're -- proselyte the religion, you

get all sorts of converts who will just use it in the same

MR. KNEEDLER:

I certainly do.

Government -- the United States has a compelling interest

14

in encouraging this, and section 801(a) --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It has to be
