ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
Respondent alleges in this Bivens action that

12

petitioners, who were postal inspectors, caused him to

13

be prosecuted in retaliation for activity protected by

14

the First Amendment.

15

claim, however, respondent must establish that there

16

was no probable cause for the prosecution.

17

for three mutually reinforcing reasons.

18

In order to make out such a

That is so

First, that requirement accords with the

19

deference this Court has consistently held in Armstrong

20

and other cases must be given to the prosecutorial

21

function because that function is core to the executive

22

branch's operations and because prosecutorial decision-

23

making is ill-suited to judicial second guessing.

24
25

Second, that rule accords a -- an important
objective screen and check against claims of

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

retaliatory prosecution in order to guard against the

2

chilling effect that would otherwise routinely arise

3

from inquiry into the subjective motivations of those

4

involved in the prosecutorial decisionmaking process.

5

And third, that rule is deeply rooted in

6

history.

7

prosecution is but one species of a claim of malicious

8

prosecution, and it has long been required that an

9

essential element of a claim of malicious prosecution

A claim of First Amendment retaliatory

10

is that the plaintiff show an absence of probable cause

11

for the prosecution.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm -- I'm not sure why --

13

why we should make the classification that you did,

14

that -- that retaliatory is simply a species of -- of

15

malicious.

16

but we've also got an entirely separate First Amendment

17

value here which just is not part of the -- the

18

analytical mix when you're talking about malicious

19

prosecution.

20

should classify it as you argue.

21

I mean, I -- I can see the similarities,

So I'm not sure why we should -- we -- we

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- for several

22

reasons.

23

the alleged First Amendment retaliation describes the

24

malice, a form of the malice that would arise in --

25

First of all, the -- the First Amendment --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it's -- it's a peculiar,

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

if you will, a peculiar malice with its own set of

2

constitutional values, and I don't know of anything

3

comparable in -- in malicious prosecution generically.

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, to be sure, what renders

5

it malice or wrongful is the First Amendment, but --

6

but the derivation of -- of the reason for why it's

7

wrongful does not, I think, detract from the essential

8

relevance of the tort of malicious prosecution.

9

And if -- if I may add to that, the -- the

10

reason why the -- the tort of malicious prosecution is

11

highly relevant here is not simply because on the

12

malice side of it, but also because it has long been

13

recognized, beginning with Blackstone before the First

14

Amendment and the Constitution were even adopted, that

15

there are critical interests on the other side, not

16

simply the defendant's interest in avoiding badly

17

motivated prosecutions, but the important

18

countervailing public interest of ensuring that

19

wrongdoers are brought to justice and that those who

20

have information about it will come forward.

21

And -- and that was recognized by Blackstone

22

early on and has been recognized consistent --

23

consistently by this Court in -- in many, many

24

decisions, including recent cases of this Court

25

involving immunity issues, which is what we have here,

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

specifically recognizing that the tort of malicious

2

prosecution is very instructive in deciding how rules

3

should be applied when a Bivens action or a 1983 action

4

is brought in the specific context of prosecution.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But, of course, here --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose there is probable

7

cause for a prosecution, but the prosecutors are

8

extremely busy and they -- they have to select their

9

cases and they select one in which they bring the

10

prosecution against the defendant on account of his

11

speech.

12

Is that a violation of the prosecutorial duty?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, in -- in terms -- in

13

terms of the responsibilities of the prosecutor, there

14

--

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

-- that -- that should not --

17

that should not be a -- a selection criterion in

18

itself, but it --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm -- I'm asking is it a

20

violation of the prosecutor's professional obligations

21

and his professional duties?

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- I would think

23

ordinarily yes, but with this caveat.

24

which is never relevant to the prosecutorial decision-

25

making process, there can often be a prosecution -- and

Unlike race

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

this case is one of them -- in which you might have

2

claims of public corruption.

3

was a guilty plea here on the part of a member of the

4

Postal Service board of directors for receiving

5

payments to -- for his activity on behalf of

6

respondent's corporation and others.

7

involving contracts for $250 million.

8

very important procurement by the Post Office

9

Department and it is understandable that in connection

And -- and in fact, there

This -- this -This was a very,

10

with that prosecution, the prosecutors and the Postal

11

Service investigators would look into issues of

12

respondent's, or people in his behalf, approaching the

13

Government.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just going back to the

15

hypothetical, if -- if you acknowledge -- and I think

16

you must -- that there's a violation of the

17

prosecutorial duty in -- in the instance I suppose,

18

then why shouldn't the law recognize it and -- and give

19

force to that sanction and give force to that rule?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, there -- there are

21

certain restrictions -- certainly restrictions on what

22

the prosecutor may do, but several points about that.

23

First of all, this is not a Bivens action

24

against the prosecutor.

25

immune from suit.

The prosecutor is absolutely

The prosecutor's decision-making

1

process is -- is, in fact, as is the grand jury's, a --

2

a critical protection against malicious prosecution --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

Well, then

4

we'll just change the hypothetical to make it the

5

investigators.

6

based on this speech that they consider unwelcome.

7

The investigators select their case

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the -- the question is

8

whether in that circumstance the -- the Bivens

9

plaintiff, the criminal defendant, has a First

10

Amendment right to be excused from prosecution or,

11

after the prosecution is unsuccessful, to bring a civil

12

action, whether he has a right not to have been

13

prosecuted in those circumstances notwithstanding the

14

existence of probable cause and the independent

15

judgment by the prosecutor.

16
17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, does he have a right

not to be singled out because of his speech?

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

He does -- he does not have a

19

-- he does not have a First Amendment claim in those

20

circumstances where there is probable cause for the

21

violation.

22
23
24
25

The -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I asked does he have a

right not to be singled out because of his speech.
MR. KNEEDLER:

He does not have a First

Amendment right not to be singled out in those

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

circumstances.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In other words, you -- you

3

would advise law enforcement officials that they can

4

single out persons for prosecution based on distasteful

5

speech.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

I'm not endorsing the motivation.

8

saying is what is --

9

I would not.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I'm not --

What I'm -- what I'm

What I want you to do is to

10

agree.

11

principle in the law, and I think your answer has to be

12

even though there's that principle, there's a lot of

13

problems with enforcing it because there are going to

14

be too many suits, it's hard to -- it's difficult for

15

the Government to defend, and -- and so forth and so

16

on.

17

I -- I think you have to concede there is this

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

I -- I'm not disputing

18

that it -- that -- that a -- a prosecution should not

19

be brought or should not be heard --

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And you're not disputing

21

either, as I understand it.

22

we assume the prosecution would not have been brought

23

but for the retaliatory motive.

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

As the case comes to us,

I -- it is -- we certainly

disagree with that with our proposition.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But don't you assume that

2

for the purposes of your argument?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

probable -- probable cause claim, yes.

5
6

For -- for purposes of our

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, that's the only

argument.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

That -- that is true, but

8

that, of course, was also true at common law for -- for

9

malicious prosecution.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the -- one of the

11

differences -- am I not correct, that at common law the

12

prosecutor did not have absolute immunity?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

At common law -- at common

14

law, yes.

15

reformulating the common law principles of -- of

16

immunity, the -- the public prosecutor now has absolute

17

immunity under -- under these --

22

As this Court has recognized in

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Now does, but not at common

law.
MR. KNEEDLER:

-- under these Court's --

under this Court's decisions.
But at common law, the prosecutor did have

23

the protection of malicious prosecution, and as

24

Justice Scalia observed in his concurring opinion in

25

the Kalina decision, the elements of the tort of

4

prosecutor.

5

the complaining witness -- he could not be the subject

6

of a suit for damages if -- if the charges were

7

dismissed, not simply upon a showing -- it required

8

more than simply a showing of malice.

9

showing of an absence of probable cause for reasons

It afforded protection for the

The -- the private citizen who -- who --

It required a

10

that are essentially identical to the qualified

11

immunity and absolute immunity -- the -- the reasons

12

for qualified and absolute immunity.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. -Well, they're not totally

15

identical because you didn't have the First Amendment

16

interest involved in those cases, whereas you do have a

17

First Amendment interest at stake here.

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

But -- but on -- on the -- on

19

the governmental interest side of the balance, the

20

interests are exactly the same in both -- in both

21

circumstances.

22

to create circumstances where people would hold back

23

from coming forward with information of violations of

24

the law because of fear that they would be sued and

25

retaliated against afterward.

And that is not to chill -- not -- not

And that hasn't changed

now that we have public prosecutors.

critical.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's still

Mr. Kneedler, may -- would

4

you clarify just one point about this probable cause?

5

There was a grand jury that indicted this man, and then

6

there was a trial judge who said, I'm throwing this out

7

at the close of the Government's case.

8

enough evidence here to convict this man.

9

There is not

Are you saying that as long as the grand jury

10

indicts, there can be no Bivens claim because in order

11

to indict, the grand jury would have had to find

12

probable cause?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, at -- at common law

14

on the tort of malicious prosecution, the indictment

15

created a presumption because an indictment does have

16

to depend upon probable cause, and under the -- under

17

this Court's decision in Gerstein v. Pugh and other

18

decisions, that can't be reexamined by the court in the

19

prosecution.

20

But at common law, the -- the indictment

21

created a presumption that was subject to rebuttal by

22

the -- by the civil plaintiff.

23

disagreement about what would be necessary, whether you

24

would have to show fraud on the grand jury or whether

25

you could just retry --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, tell me about now,

not at the common law.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

We do not -- we do not

4

think that the existence of the grand -- it has not

5

been our position that the existence of the indictment

6

is dispositive and cannot be challenged, but we do

7

think it --

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
find probable cause.

But the grand jury did

So what would the plaintiff have

10

to show to overcome -- to -- to negate that finding of

11

probable cause?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

We -- we think in a -- in a --

13

it would have to show by at least a preponderance of

14

the evidence, maybe a clear showing, that there was not

15

probable cause.

16

-- to the standard for qualified immunity, which is

17

could a reasonable person in those circumstances have

18

believed that there was probable cause.

19

the grand jury returns an indictment, that that should

20

be pretty persuasive evidence but not compelling

21

evidence -- I mean, not dispositive evidence that there

22

was probable cause.

23

And I think that also ties in to the

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

I think, if

The case that comes

24

closest, as far as I can see, is probably United States

25

v. Armstrong, and in that case, this Court said in the

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

ordinary case, so long as the prosecutor has probable

2

cause to believe the offense was committed, the

3

decision to prosecute or go before a grand jury rests

4

entirely in his discretion.

5

discretion is subject to constitutional constraints,

6

the equal protection component of the Due Process

7

Clause.

8

based on an unjustifiable standard such as race,

9

religion, or other arbitrary classification.

But, of course, the

The decision whether to prosecute may not be

And the

10

standard the Court articulated there was the defendant

11

must present clear evidence --

12
13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, clear evidence, and the

Court stressed that it was a --

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

-- to the contrary.

15

that's different from your proposition of probable

16

cause.

17
18
19
20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- I think several

things may explain that.
In Armstrong, that was a claim of selective
prosecution that was brought --

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Based on race.

Based on race.

That was one

23

of the distinctions I was going to point to.

24

secondly --

25

Now,

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And

So why should that be

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

different than the First Amendment violation?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, as -- as this Court's

3

decision in -- in Johnson, for example, shows, there --

4

distinctions based on race are subject to strict

5

scrutiny no matter what the context, in that case even

6

in the prison context, whereas First Amendment claims

7

often take account of the context in which they are

8

raised.

9

Anti-Discrimination case held that there would -- could

For example, this Court in the American-Arab

10

be no claim at all of selective prosecution in the

11

immigration context because of the important

12

countervailing interest in enforcing the law.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you're willing to

14

acknowledge -- and -- and the Government concedes that

15

you can have a different standard when the -- the basis

16

for the selective prosecution happens to violate the

17

Constitution from the standard you apply where the

18

basis for the selective prosecution doesn't violate the

19

Constitution, such as I'm prosecuting him because he

20

was mean to my brother-in-law.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay?

No.
Are you going to apply a

23

different standard there than you would apply where --

24

where the reason is some First Amendment reason?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, no.

The -- the other

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

distinction -- and -- and I'm not sure if this goes to

2

your point or not.

3

Armstrong the claim was made in the criminal

4

prosecution itself.

5

action after the criminal prosecution is over with, and

6

it's in that -- in that context especially that the

7

analogy to malicious prosecution is very strong and why

8

the element of -- that the person has to -- that the --

9

there has to have been a favorable termination for the

10

The other distinction is that in

Here, the claim is the civil

-- for the plaintiff and there has to be a probable cause.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

But would you answer my

question?

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

16

But that doesn't --

Yes.

I'm -- I'm not sure that I --

maybe -- I guess I --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's going be a different

18

criterion -- you -- you say it's going to be different

19

for the First Amendment and the -- and -- and the Equal

20

Protection Clause, at least where race is involved.

21

What if there's no constitutional violation at all, but

22

I just selectively prosecute him just because I don't

23

like this guy or because he was mean to a relative of

24

mine?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I don't -- I don't --

Is there going to be a

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

There -- there wouldn't

be any -- any constitutional claim and any -- any

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly, and would you apply

7

a different standard because there isn't a

constitutional claim?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

10

claim at all.

11

a claim.

12
13
14

No.

I mean, there wouldn't be any basis for

JUSTICE STEVENS:
claim.

There wouldn't be any

-- a malicious prosecution

You'd have a malicious prosecution claim.
MR. KNEEDLER:

There -- there -- and in the

15

-- in the Federal sphere, if there was a malicious -- a

16

common law malicious prosecution claim, that would have

17

to be brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act against

18

the United States.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But, Mr. Kneedler, I

20

understand your argument to be they should be treated

21

just like a malicious prosecution claim, which is no

22

distinction between a constitutional basis and a common

23

-- and just that he hated his brother-in-law.

24

you're saying they're the same.

25

understand Justice Scalia to be asking you.

I think

MR. KNEEDLER:

3

Well, yes.

I -- I am -- I am

saying that --

4
5

That's what I'm asking.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Which places no weight at

all on the fact the Constitution is involved.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Oh -- oh, it does because the

7

-- because the -- the first -- the existence of the

8

First Amendment claim is what gives you the Bivens

9

cause of action in the first place.

So otherwise,

10

there wouldn't be any Federal cause of action at all

11

without -- without the First Amendment claim.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's how you'd get at

13

least as much protection as if it was an ordinary

14

malicious prosecution claim, but you don't get any more

15

under your view.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, because -- and -- and

17

18

the background of the common law tort of malicious

19

prosecution, which strikes exactly the balance that I

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you really want three

things.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I

11

want to know -- you simply say you need clear and

12

convincing evidence that that was the motive and it

13

wouldn't have been brought otherwise.

14

existence of probable cause is a strong factor, maybe

15

even a presumption, that suggests to the contrary.

And the

Now, have States and other places tried
things like that without the world collapsing?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

My understanding from --

19

from reading the treatises on -- on malicious

20

prosecution, for example, that there has been no

21

watering down of the probable cause requirement because

22

it is understood to be a critical check against --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

So as far as you know, every

24

State and every jurisdiction where -- and investigators

25

if they don't have absolutely immunity, whatever -- in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

all those jurisdictions, nobody has ever said that even

that's the end of it.

the tort of malicious prosecution which is --

I'm not aware that any jurisdiction has done that.
But in response to your proposal, the -- the

-- what -- what's wrong with that is that it would

15

allow extensive inquiry, discovery, other inquiry into

the subjective motivations of persons involved in the

decision-making process with no mechanism analogous to

weed out --

The other question I have, which you might

want to be brief about, is in looking through this

went ahead and prosecuted this man with only two pieces

the fact he owns the company, how is there probable

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Kneedler, I know you're

7

responding to Justice Breyer's question, but I think

8

for purposes of our decision, we're not supposed to

9

decide whether there was probable cause or not, but

10

we're to give you the opportunity to prove there was if

11

-- if you win on your --

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, although I -- I certainly

13

do not want to leave the misimpression that -- and

14

there is -- there is much more.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that's a disputed

16

issue, and we don't have to decide the probable cause

17

issue.

18

Is that not correct?
MR. KNEEDLER:

That -- that -- you do not

19

have -- you do not have to decide it, but I would

20

certainly urge the Court not to proceed on the

21

assumption or make any comments that there is because

22

there were -- there were --

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But because the other side

24

is arguing that even if there is probable cause, the

25

burden shifts when they prove the retaliatory motive,

would have been discharged anyway.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Why isn't it the

What is very different is that

15

this is the prosecutorial function.

16

recognized in Armstrong, that is a core executive

17

branch function and it is one that the courts are ill-

18

suited to second-guess because a whole variety of

19

determinations can enter into whether to prosecute

20

somebody, whether they -- whether the particular

21

conduct -- how culpable the person is, whether the

22

conduct fits into the overall prosecutorial priorities,

23

whether there will be cooperating witnesses, what --

24

what the office's resources are.

2

prosecutor had to --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Wouldn't -- wouldn't all

those considerations justify a rule that makes the

5

burden of proving the retaliatory motive very high,

6

say, maybe it has to be by clear and convincing

7

evidence or something like that?

8

acknowledged -- I don't know if they're really

9

acknowledged here, but there's strong evidence of

But once you have it

10

retaliatory motive -- why shouldn't the burden shift

11

just on that, on the basis of that proof?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well -- oh, not -- we do not

13

think there is strong evidence of retaliatory motive.

14

And I -- I can -- can address that, but --

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if you had a --

-- but --- if you had a heavy

18

burden of proof at that stage of the proceeding,

19

wouldn't that protect the interests that mainly concern

20

you?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

We -- we think the more direct

22

-- I don't think so for -- partly for the reason that I

23

-- that I gave to Justice Breyer is that -- that that

24

would not protect against discovery and -- and the sort

25

of chilling inquiry that this Court has recognized in

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

its immunity cases, and especially in the prosecutorial

2

function where the prosecutor would be required to

3

disclose.

4

immune, the prosecutor's decision-making process and

5

his communication with law enforcement agents would --

6

would be exposed for judicial scrutiny, public scrutiny

7

in a way that could chill the prosecutorial function.

8
9

Even though the prosecutor is absolutely

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Kneedler, the defendant

here is not the prosecutor.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right?

Right.
Just someone who provided

12

information to the prosecutor that -- that was

13

erroneous and allegedly maliciously motivated.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't think erroneous.

15

was allegedly maliciously motivated.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand how you would apply the

19

test, would -- you know, would you have prosecuted

20

anyway, when -- you know, but for the malicious motive,

21

when the person you're -- you're suing is not the

22

prosecutor.

23

would be a prosecution.

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

It wasn't up to this person whether there

I think that's a -- I think

that's a very important point, and before a -- a court

26
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

enters into that, in the end, unknowable question,

2

maybe a court can -- can, in the end, determine

3

probabilities, but before a court undertakes that,

4

which requires looking not simply at the motivation of

5

the -- of the law enforcement officers, but the

6

prosecutor and -- and who knows whether the grand jury

7

would have returned an indictment, and yet a court

8

certainly couldn't be expected to inquire into that.

9

Now, so we -- we think that that's another reason why

10

the probable cause requirement is a critical gateway

11

before a court is -- is going to enter into that

12

determination.

13

And all -- and it's important to remember

14

it's not just proving the question of causation, but

15

these are people who are several steps removed from the

16

-- from the prosecutorial decision.

17

personal liability would be visited on the law

18

enforcement agents who were doing their job and

19

cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office.

And the -- and the

The

Mr. Kneedler, the D.C.

Circuit, looking at this case, looking at the record

closely, typed it one in which the evidence of

2

retaliation was strong and probable cause weak.

3

is on 28a of the appendix to the petition for cert.

4

That was the appraisal of the D.C. Circuit panel.

5

I think you've been arguing that that is not the case,

6

but at least for our purposes at this posture, don't we

7

-- shouldn't we accept that that is the picture here,

8

weak evidence of probable cause, strong indications of

9

retaliation?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

This

And

I -- I don't -- I don't think

11

there's any reason to accept that because there's no

12

factual determinations to that effect.

13

There -- there are really just two snippets

14

of evidence that are primarily relied upon by the court

15

of appeals for the view that there was a retaliatory

16

motive here.

17

observations that the -- that the inspectors made to --

corporation should be indicted.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK F. McCARTAN

10

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

11
12
13

Mr. McCartan.

MR. McCARTAN:

Justice Stevens, if it please

the Court:
If I may, Your Honors, I would like to start

14

with the very pointed inquiry that Justice Kennedy made

15

at the opening of the argument here.

16

The petitioners here do not challenge,

17

because they cannot challenge, as was evident from the

18

concession made here this morning, that a criminal

19

prosecution cannot be based upon the exercise of a

20

constitutional right.

21

to that rule, an exception that would mean, despite the

22

overwhelming evidence of retaliation of record in this

23

case, there would be no violation of the First

24

Amendment here and that would treat any prosecution

25

based solely upon race, religion, or protected speech

What they want is an exception

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the same as a tort for malicious prosecution.

2

accomplish this end, what they are trying to do is to

3

force probable cause as a standard into a framework

4

where it doesn't belong, where it won't work, and

5

which, if done here, is going to be contrary to several

6

existing decisions of this Court.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And to

Mr. McCartan, how does --

8

how does your standard work?

9

Mr. Kneedler.

The same question I asked

The -- the test you would propose is

10

whether but for the retaliatory motive, the prosecution

11

would have been brought anyway?

12
13

MR. McCARTAN:

That would be the test, Your

Honor, for recovery when the matter goes to trial.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. McCARTAN:

Right.

The test that I would propose

16

is the very test that this Court set forth in Harlow

17

against Fitzgerald because we're here really on a very

18

limited issue of qualified immunity.

19

determine whether the defense of qualified immunity is

20

available to the petitioners here.

21

proper standard for making that determination was set

22

forth by this Court in Harlow and it's whether the

23

conduct alleged --

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We have to

The standard, the

But, Mr. McCartan, I don't

mean to interrupt you, but I thought the primary issue

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

was not the qualified immunity issue, but whether we

2

have a cause of action in the first place.

3

MR. McCARTAN:

4

no, I think that the --

5

Well, Your Honor, whether --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And on that, they say you

6

don't have a cause of action unless you're able to

7

prove an absence of probable cause.

8
9

MR. McCARTAN:

I think what they are saying

is the defense of qualified immunity should be

10

available if there should be probable cause for the

11

action that was taken here.

12

the Court is on the very limited issue of whether the

13

defense of qualified immunity is available to the

14

petitioners.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think the case before

No.

I think they would say

16

absolute immunity, not qualified.

17

saying if there's probable cause, the game is over.

18

-- no qualified --

19

MR. McCARTAN:

I -- I think they're

That's exactly what they're

20

saying, and what I'm saying is that is the wrong

21

standard to be applying.

22

No

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, but there are two

23

questions in the cert petition and it's the second one

24

that's the qualified immunity issue, and the first one

25

is whether there's a cause of action.

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. McCARTAN:

All right.

Well, Your Honor,

2

let -- let me -- let me back up for just a moment then

3

with respect to that.

4

Let me say that probable cause is not the

5

proper standard which should be applied here.

6

proper standard is the standard that is set forth by

7

this Court in Harlow and as refined later in Anderson

8

against Creighton and a number of other decisions.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

But the difficulty I think

10

we're all having with it is that the qualified immunity

11

issue and the standard to which you are -- are

12

adverting responds to a question that doesn't arise

13

unless we first assume that there is -- that there is a

14

constitutional violation.

15

MR. McCARTAN:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's correct.
And our questions are, what

17

is the standard for determining the constitutional

18

violation?

19

get to Harlow.

20

Once we get that squared away, then we'll

MR. McCARTAN:

The standard that is to be set

21

forth to determine whether there is a constitutional

22

violation is that that this Court applied in Mt.

23

Healthy City School District against Doyle and in

24

Crawford-El against Britton, and that is if there is

25

illegally or unconstitutionally motivated conduct, it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

will not be excused simply because there may be some

2

objectively valid basis for taking such action.

3

is the conceptual framework that was established in

4

those cases and which should be applied by way of

5

analysis.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

That

If it is applied here, I --

7

I thought we just granted question one.

in the cert petition.

totally cut them off because they have absolute

Now, we're saying at least let's restrict

them, where investigators are involved, to cases where

it turned out there was no probable cause, otherwise

the criminal process itself will be seriously injured.

11

Now, I take it that's the argument.

I'd like

to hear your reply.

12

MR. McCARTAN:

That is exactly the argument,

13

Your Honor, and what it comes down to is whether the

14

burdens of litigation in a situation of this kind will

15

justify judicial alteration of the protection of the

16

First Amendment.

17

from the outset in the first question Justice Kennedy

18

asked.

No, but are you going to --

20

I mean, is there any light you could shed?

there were some jurisdictions somewhere that -- that

MR. McCARTAN:

The prosecutor is not a

judgment, but he can be brought into court when -- when

6

an investigator is sued in -- in order to take his

testimony as to what would have happened?

MR. McCARTAN:

His testimony was taken in

this case and can be taken in this case because at that

point in these proceedings -- and you have to look at

-- there is very clear evidence of retaliation as a

motive for this prosecution.

In Heck against Humphrey, which this Court

6

viewed as a collateral attack on an outstanding

7

conviction, the Court held that there had to be a

8

favorable termination of the criminal proceeding in

9

order to maintain the civil action for damages under

10

section 1983.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. McCARTAN:

Oh, that's 1983.

The Court went on to say,

13

however, that if the civil damage action would not

14

necessarily impugn the conviction, that the case could

15

proceed even though there had not been a favorable

16

termination, reversal, or expungement --

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So what he does

is he --

21

he says here I am 20 years in prison and I agree I'm

guilty, but they never would have prosecuted me without

23

the fact that they hate the Hell's Angels and they, in

18

probable cause is not the appropriate standard is

discovery, and discovery means you not only talk to the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. McCARTAN:

That's why --

Yes.

If there is evidence

7

here with respect to retaliation, then the question of

8

whether the independent act of the prosecutor somehow

9

immunizes that conduct is a question of fact for the

10

trier of fact in the case.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the action -Suppose the prosecutor

12

said, you shouldn't have brought this to me because you

13

-- you're -- you're motivated by the First Amendment.

14

But now that it's here, I have my own independent

15

interest in going ahead.

16

MR. McCARTAN:

That's the evidence the

17

Government can bring forward when the burden of proof

18

shifts upon a showing of an illegal or unconstitutional

19

motive for bringing the prosecution to begin with.

That's the kind of evidence the Government would

present to show that the prosecution would have taken

significant distinction, Your Honor, but I think we

grievance.

We don't say he doesn't have absolute immunity when -when he's been guilty of a constitutional violation.

MR. McCARTAN:

remains that if in the prosecutorial context that the

violation, then that teaches us that the same rule

18

should apply to this case.

With all respect, I don't think that that would really

2

operate under the assumption that if the prosecution

3

fails, they will be subject to civil liability, which

4

is exactly what Blackstone said, as this Court quoted

5

in Dinsman v. Wilkes.

6

The reason for the rule is that it would be a

7

very great discouragement to public justice if

8

prosecutors, who have a tolerable ground of suspicion,

9

were liable to be sued at law whenever their

16

there's no reason to grope for some sort of screen

malicious prosecution is what this Court relied upon in

Heck v. Humphrey for the favorable termination rule,

20

that you could not bring a 1983 suit unless the

conviction had been set aside and the proceeding was

22

terminated in favor of the plaintiff.

2

this Court noticed in -- in the Dinsman case.

is, that it is important not to have law enforcement

4

officers be chilled from the important function of

5

furnishing information to prosecutors.

6

And that

And this Court's decision in Armstrong

7

imposed an important objective test that you have to

How about the judge

granting a motion to quit at the close of the

MR. KNEEDLER:

Why isn't that objective?
Because at -- at common law --

17

and I think this was an important insight.

18

law, it was not even evidence of the absence of

19

probable cause because a judgment of acquittal turns on

20

the determination that a factfinder -- a reasonable

21

fact finder could not find beyond a reasonable doubt

22

that the defendant had actually committed the crime.
