CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Incorporated v. Federal Election Commission.

Mr. Bopp.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. BOPP:

Thank you, and Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case involves the fundamental First

12

Amendment question of whether the Government can shield

13

lawmakers from grassroots lobbying about upcoming votes

14

in Congress through campaign finance laws.

15

This Court has distinguished the regulation

16

of corporate electioneering from efforts to influence

17

lawmaking, finding sufficiently compelling

18

governmental interests in regulating electioneering,

19

but not grassroots lobbying.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Bopp, right -- right

21

there I guess I -- I have a problem with -- with your

22

argument, and I just want to get it out.

23

and looked at some of the examples that were given at

24

-- in -- in the McConnell case for parallels between

25

what we -- what we thought was covered in those cases

I went back

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

and -- and yours -- your case.

2

which I -- I guessed was probably the closest was the --

3

was the advertisements there in -- in the McConnell

4

case on the -- the lobbying on the Chinese trade

5

relations.

6

China uses forced labor.

7

States is about to make it easier for -- for Chinese

8

goods to get in here and for China to have a

9

respectable trade status.

And the -- the one

The basic message in -- in that case was
The Congress of the United

And -- and it said, call

10

Congressman Myrick, I think it was, in any case, a

11

Member of Congress, and -- and say what you think.

12

In this case, you're -- you're talking about

13

a -- a filibuster, and you say, you know, they're

14

filibustering nominees and they're not coming up to --

15

to a vote.

16

and Feingold, that -- that you don't like this.

17

Tell the two Senators in this State, Kohl

The only difference that I could see

18

basically between the two kinds of ads was that in the

19

first one -- in -- in the Myrick ad, they actually gave

20

the number of the -- of the congressional office to

21

call and say, hey, don't do this.

22

In this case, your clients did not give a --

23

a number.

24

Insofar as I know, it doesn't have a number.

25

They gave a Web site to an organization.

Which gets me to the question.

If the -- the

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Chinese trade relations ad was presumably validly

2

subject to the act, I don't see why your client's ad is

3

not, for the same reason, subject to the act and for

4

the further reason that it doesn't even give a phone

5

number to call -- to -- to lobby the people.

6

to me that on stare decisis grounds, unless we're going

7

to go back and simply reexamine McConnell to -- to --

8

from -- from scratch, that your clients fall within the

9

general rule as -- as we held it in McConnell.

10
11

So it seems

So why

doesn't precedent foreclose this?
MR. BOPP:

Well, there -- there is a few

12

specifics about the -- about our ad that -- that I

13

would like to remind the Court of.

14

First, it was not -- the call to action at

15

the end of the ad was not just call them up and tell

16

them what you think.

17

the Senators and ask them to oppose the filibuster.

18

it was specific.

The call to action was to call

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

give their phone numbers.

21

MR. BOPP:

So

Yes, but you didn't even

Well, and then it refers to a Web

22

site, befair.org, which contained prominently on the

23

first page the phone numbers and addresses and all

24

contact information for these two Senators.

25

decision was made by the speaker here that it would be

The

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

more likely that the recipient of the ad would remember

2

the phrase, befair.org, and seek the information on

3

that Web site than to have a -- you know, a -- a phone

4

number that is just simply more difficult to -- to

5

remember.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

So if we accept that

7

extra step, that's -- that gets you -- if -- if we

8

accept the extra step that gets you parallel to the --

9

to the ad that we considered in McConnell.

10

MR. BOPP:

Well, it -- it doesn't, the one

11

that you mentioned, because it was just call them up

12

and --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- if it's the fact that

14

you go to the Web site and that's what's supposed to

15

make this what it was in McConnell which, by the way,

16

we said was illegal, what they -- the first thing

17

they're going to see when they get to the Web site,

18

which I agree with you -- four times in 3 of the 12

19

sentences of this ad -- in 3 of the 12 -- it says,

20

befair.org, visit befair.org, go to befair.org.

21

the first thing that they're going to see when they get

22

to befair.org is a big headline in bold -- gold -- bold

23

letters which says, Feingold and Kohl continue to

24

support unprecedented filibusters of judicial nominees.

25

And

So, in fact, if befair.org is brought into the

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

picture, that makes this ad look much more like an

2

effort to -- to defeat Senator Feingold than the ad

3

that we considered in our previous case.

4

MR. BOPP:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. BOPP:

Well, it --

No.

Doesn't it?
In your previous case, there

7

were certainly genuine issue ads.

8

recognized that it -- that there were genuine issue ads

9

that were not for the purpose of influencing an

This Court

10

election.

11

core of what a genuine issue ad is.

12

pending legislative issue, and the only reference to

13

the Senator -- and it was both Senators, not just the

14

one up for election -- was to contact them about --

15

about how -- whether to support or oppose that specific

16

initiative.

I believe that these ads are at the very

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It involves a -- a

Yes, but in McConnell --

But if you are right --- in McConnell, the Court

20

said corporations and unions may finance genuine issue

21

ads during election blackout periods by simply avoiding

22

any specific reference to Federal candidates or, in

23

doubtful cases, by paying for the ad from a segregated

24

fund.

25

that the Court was saying there are no genuine issue

Now, that language indicates, to me at least,

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

ads meeting the definition as you would have us apply

2

it here.

3

MR. BOPP:

Well, that -- that part of the

4

opinion needs to be read in light of the footnote,

5

which is attached to those very words, which said in

6

footnote 88 that the interests that support regulation

7

of electioneering may not apply to genuine grassroots

8

lobbying and distinguished the McConnell case from

9

Bellotti and McIntyre.

10

So we do have to recognize that there's two

11

things going on here.

12

but also Congress is in session.

13

engaging in its lawmaking function.

14

There -- there is an election,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Government is

Mr. Bopp, to what extent

15

can we take into account the surrounding circumstances?

16

One thing that you advocate is to look at this ad in

17

isolation.

18

made it clear that it opposed the candidacy of Senator

19

Feingold and that it supported his opponents, that your

20

organization also connected, as Justice Breyer just

21

brought out, Senator Feingold with this filibuster, and

22

then if the filibuster was such an important thing for

23

grassroots lobbying, why was it that when the election

24

was over, this ad was not repeated?

25

But if you add to it that your organization

MR. BOPP:

Well, of course, the final point

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is -- is in the record, that -- that is, it was -- the

2

-- it was supposed to come to a head in November and

3

then it did not.

4
5

It was abandoned.

But the -- but the point is you cannot -- I
don't think that the Government can condition --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I don't -- I don't

7

understand what you just said.

8

MR. BOPP:

9

Well -- well, the -- the

filibuster issue, as it related to that session of

10

Congress, it was thought that it was going to come to a

11

head in -- in October -- excuse me -- but it -- but as

12

a -- but it did not.

13

-- it would not have been run after November.

14

So that is the reason why it was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but I mean, once it didn't

15

come to a head in November and it was still an issue, why

16

didn't you continue to run it?

17

MR. BOPP:

Well, each organization has to

18

make an assessment with respect to the different issues

19

that they want to be lobbying on and the -- their

20

pressing nature.

21
22

And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your point

was that it was not an issue after the election.

23

MR. BOPP:

Well -- well, it was in the -- in

24

the next session of Congress and has been an -- an

25

issue.

But each -- a lobby organization makes a

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

decision about the priorities that they have and

2

whether or not their lobbying efforts will most likely

3

affect legislative action.

4

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Were you taking a

5

position on this issue prior to the election time

6

frame?

7

MR. BOPP:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Yes.

The -Had you taken out

advertisements prior to that time frame?

10

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

Yes, and in fact these radio

11

and television ads were continuing up until the

12

blackout period and it was the blackout period that

13

triggered the case.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the basic question I

15

think is this.

16

are here -- spent an entire summer reading through one

17

of the longest set of opinions I've ever seen from the

18

lower courts and going through a record that they had

19

compiled over months reflecting 6 years of

20

congressional effort.

21

dozens, hundreds I think, of examples was the basis for

22

Congress' conclusion that there's simply no way to know

23

whether an ad like yours is a genuine issue ad or

24

isn't.

25

stopping rich people or corporations or labor unions

All of us -- or almost all of us who

And what that record showed with

And the only way that we have a hope of

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

from simply trying to defeat candidates by writing sham

2

ads is to have the rule that we had.

3

Now, you have a very good argument, but it's

4

an argument that I heard right in that case.

5

considered right in that case issues like yours, just

6

ads like yours, ads that were even less sham-like than

7

yours, if you want to call yours a sham -- I don't mean

8

to be pejorative.

9

we used them as an example.

And we

But we considered all that, and then
And of course, it was

10

close.

11

apparently neutral on their face than yours, Congress

12

can impose this requirement.

13

5 to 4 this Court said ads that are even more

Now, what's different about your ad than the

14

ads we put right in that opinion as examples of what

15

we'd allow Congress to control?

16

or are you asking us to go back only a year later and

17

undo what we did?

18

MR. BOPP:

No.

What's different now

I'm asking you to give

19

meaning to the holding of this Court that there were

20

genuine issue ads that were broadcast during that

21

period of time.

22

asked you to do a Broadrick analysis upholding the

23

statute on its face, reserving as-applied challenges to

24

genuine issue ads in subsequent cases.

25

this case is about.

The Government conceded 7 percent,

That is what

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And the difference here is that as Judge Leon

2

-- the record of the case -- in Judge Leon's opinion,

3

he went for a number of pages explaining what genuine

4

issue ads in his view were, and what -- and he said

5

that if the ad discusses a current legislative issue

6

and refers to the Member of Congress in calling on him

7

or her to take a particular action on that issue, that

8

constitutes a genuine issue ad.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MR. BOPP:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can we return to --

These people are lawmaking.
Mr. Bopp, then can we

12

return to my question?

13

and do we discount the connection by your organization

14

of this Senator with the filibuster that you said was

15

a very bad thing?

16
17

MR. BOPP:

Do we view the ad in isolation,

And I'm sorry.

I was interrupted.

I wasn't able to get to that question.

18

And the -- the Government cannot condition

19

the exercise of one right on exercising another.

20

There's a First Amendment right for the PAC of

21

Wisconsin Right to Life to support or oppose

22

candidates.

23

influencing current lawmaking.

25

the First Amendment, petition is separately listed.

That's different than what its lobby group

And so that is why, in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the electorate will

2

know that this issue is presented to them in connection

3

with this Senator and that your organization has linked

4

the two very clearly.

5

MR. BOPP:

But, you know, the -- the effect

6

on an election is remote and speculative and not proven

7

by -- in terms of genuine issue ads in this record.

8

But these people are lawmaking now.

9

pressing need and, indeed, right for people today to

So there's a

10

influence the Government's lawmaking regardless of the

11

incidental, remote, speculative, and unproven effect

12

that that genuine issue ad may have on an election.

13

There -- there is simply -- we just cannot

14

get away from the fact that the most important thing

15

that Government does is lawmaking, and because they've

16

scheduled an election should not immunize the

17

incumbents from being lobbied about that very law

18

making function that they're engaged in today.

19
20
21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then why didn't we have to

go the other way in the Chinese trade relation example?
I mean, everything --

22

MR. BOPP:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I don't think you --- unless I'm missing

24

something in your argument, everything you are saying

25

in this argument could have been said with respect to

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that ad and, as Justice Breyer said, to a couple of

2

others.

3

MR. BOPP:

Well that may very well have been

4

a genuine issue ad in the mind of this Court.

5

cited one ad, which was on page 193, which was the

6

Yellowtail ad, as an example of sham issue advertising.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

MR. BOPP:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You only

Yes.

And there, you know -And -- and we -- we cited

10

some other examples as -- as examples that, on the face

11

of it and on the face of the record, would -- would

12

lawfully fall within the -- the general rule that we

13

said Congress could prescribe.

14

MR. BOPP:

Well -- well, the Yellowtail ad,

15

which you cited and quoted as a example of sham issue

16

ad, said that the -- Mr. Yellowtail had taken a swing

17

at his wife and he justified that because he said he

18

didn't hit her.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

MR. BOPP:

21
22

No, but the point --

And then it said basically call

him up and yell at him.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I -- I don't want to cut

23

you off from your Yellowtail argument, if -- if you

24

want to make it, but it seems to me that the problem in

25

this case is that your ad is very much like a non

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Yellowtail ad.

2

accepting your argument is, number one, a problem of

3

precedent and, number two, the problem that Justice

4

Breyer raised that, again, we had dealt with in the

5

prior case.

And the problem that we would have in

MR. BOPP:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

How could it be -No, no.

Let me just finish

my question.
MR. BOPP:

Sorry.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Once you get out of the

11

sphere of -- of kind of sham ads that just hit you in

12

your face, there isn't a practical way to tell the

13

difference.

14

rejected the magic word, or Congress rejected the magic

15

word's approach.

16

a rule that it did within certain time limits,

17

identified candidates, identified audiences.

18

do it within this period of time unless you do it

19

through a PAC.

There isn't a kind of magic formula.

We

And therefore, Congress came up with

What is different in your case from those
paradigm examples in -- in McConnell?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The -- the -- no one is saying that your ad

in this case is an obviously sham ad like Yellowtail.

15

Your ad in this case is one of those ads that it's

16

difficult to deal with fairly.

know, it's an electioneering ad and you can say it's --

18

it's a lobbying ad.

Did the opinion refer to -Justice Souter.

You can say, well, you

And -- and Congress decided how to

We said that's okay.

20

MR. BOPP:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why doesn't --

Only on a facial challenge.
Yes, but why doesn't your ad

22

fall within the reasoning that we used in approving --

23

on the facial challenge, in approving the statute?

24
25

MR. BOPP:

Because the Broadrick facial

challenge analysis that you engaged in in McConnell is

No -- no question about it.

-- genuine issue ads --- challenge has got to have

something different about it, something unusual that

10

says this is why my ad does not fall within the general

11

rule. And that's what I'm trying to get at.

Are you contending that there is a

There's a category of issue ads and

I think you can create objective

criteria, just like this Court has --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

If you can answer my

question yes or no.

two mutually exclusive categories, or are there ads

18

that fit somewhat in both?

19

MR. BOPP:

adopt objective criteria as you have in the Noerr v.

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

And I'm not saying at the --

8

at the margins there -- there may not be doubtful

9

cases, but what I'm saying is that this Court in Noerr

10

v. Pennington doctrine has recognized and adopted

11

objective criteria to distinguish between genuine

12

efforts to influence the Government, which is not

13

subject to the Sherman Act, and sham issues -- efforts

14

to regulate --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does the -- does the

issue ads?

18

MR. BOPP:

No, the -- no, they haven't.

But

19

right before the 2004 election -- excuse me -- they

20

gave an exception to an auto dealership that wanted to

21

continue to run the name of the owner of the

22

dealership, despite the fact that he was a Senator -- a

23

candidate for United States Senate, during the blackout

period.

incidental effect on the election.

recognized that there is interests which are sufficient

and -- and also that the -- the possible impact on an

election is so remote that -- that the interests are --

JUSTICE BREYER:

So the FEC has

All right.

So what is the

test?

and a half ago is that there was in that testimony

10

political consultants who said if you really want to

11

defeat a Senator, here's how you do it.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Run an ad that just speaks

14

about a group of Senators.

17

even better than saying, vote against.

18

It's plain that they're

They said that's

And then our opinion said there is little

difference between an ad that urges voters to vote

Alderson Reporting Company

issue ad?

2

MR. BOPP:

I think that you would look at,

3

one, whether the -- the ad discusses a current

4

legislative issue; two, whether or not it made any

5

reference to the legislator beyond lobbying him or her

6

about that specific issue.

7

references to the election or the candidacy of the

8

incumbent or any of those type references.

9

had that, you would have a bona fide, genuine effort to

11

So there should not be any

They are voting.

They're taxing us.

They're

12

regulating us.

13

that usually most of the -- of these issues are decided

14

in the context of this blackout period at the end of --

15

end of Congress.

16

And as we know, the record reflects

So I know it is difficult to balance these

17

interests, but there is more interest among the people

18

than simply the remote and speculative effort to

19

influence an election.

20

influence how Government is regulating and taxing us.

21

So that is the interest that is presented here.

22

is the interest that the Court in McConnell recognized

23

when the Court said there are genuine issue ads and --

24

and only engage in what the Government urged was a

25

Broadrick facial challenge analysis.

There is an immediate need to

That

of these genuine issue ads can be dealt with in an as-

having asked the Court and the Court engaging in a

that even though Broadrick would allow as-applied, that

been run by your clients by a segregated fund.
MR. BOPP:

Yes.

Yes, that is true.

And --

and, of course, as -- as this Court has recognized -JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It just ran out of money.

Is that the deal?
MR. BOPP:

Well, that was only part of it.

16

They -- they didn't raise money with the anticipation

17

of doing their lobbying with it.

18

raised all their lobbying money in their -- in their

19

general treasury.

20

their PAC is to advocate the election or defeat of

21

candidates or give money to candidates, which -- which

22

this Court has recognized is a proper way of directly

23

affecting an elections.

24
25

In other words, they

2

Congress, you're going to have to identify that as a

political activity.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

If you can do

5

this, can a labor union do it?

MR. BOPP:

MR. BOPP:

Of course, the prohibition

Well, then --

11

then we're back to -- I mean, I've heard this.

12

very familiar music to me and I think you raise a tough

13

issue.

This is

I just thought we perhaps had decided it.

14

But the -- the reason that this was so tough

15

was then these very, very wealthy individuals -- and

since I once read through the list, I know who they

17

are.

19

they hire this genius political consultant that's there

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

In McConnell against FEC, this Court upheld
title II's definition and regulation of electioneering

10

communications by corporations and unions as defined in

11

the act.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In McConnell against

13

FEC, you stood there and told us that this was a facial

14

challenge and that as-applied challenges could be

15

brought in the future.

16

and now you're telling us that it's already been

17

decided.

18

This is an as-applied challenge

It's a classic bait and switch.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

No.

In -- in fairness, Mr.

19

Chief Justice, in the McConnell case at pages 105 and

20

106 of our brief, we said that as-applied challenges

21

would arguably be available.

22

argument we stressed in the brief and in oral argument

23

was that, in a sense, overbreadth analysis here and

24

even as-applied challenges, though we didn't put it in

25

those terms, are a little bit beside the point because

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there any other

challenge and then later said that an as-applied

challenge was barred by our ruling on the facial

challenge?

like in any of those cases where you have a -- a broad

14

prohibition and you say, yes, there may be situations

where it's unconstitutional, but the statute is valid

on its face.

17

my situation is one where it's unconstitutional.

21

hasn't arisen because generally when this Court clearly

identifies an area where Congress can regulate in

24

try to bring the exact same challenge.

25

give you two examples.

And if I could

If somebody after Burson against Freeman,

2

which you may remember is the case where this Court

3

upheld a 100-foot buffer zone around a polling place --

4

if somebody came in after that decision and said, well,

5

that can't apply to me in an as-applied challenge

6

because I only want to stand 90 feet away, I think they

7

would have gotten laughed out of Court because this

8

Court already said that a 100-foot buffer zone was

9

sufficient.

10

I think in a similar way --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it might have been

12

that 90 feet included a public street and you couldn't

13

go down a public street without -- so -- and so --

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kennedy --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It -- it does seems strange

16

to me in a speech case to say we're foreclosing as-

17

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And -- and, Justice Kennedy,

19

please understand me.

20

McConnell somehow magically jurisdictionally foreclosed

21

as-applied challenges.

22

come in after Burson and give a good reason why their

23

situation is very different, that there's a super

24

highway 90 feet away or that all they were talking

25

about is a bumper sticker on a car, well, then maybe

I don't mean to suggest that

say, yes, you can have an as-applied challenge, but

this one doesn't meet the test.

because the reasoning of this Court in McConnell

forecloses the decision.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's

15

because an election is -- happens to be coming up and

it's illegal the month before the election, even though

it was clearly something that they did without regard

to the election.

19

And they do that every

would be a better as-applied challenge.

that with respect to the ads in the 30 days before the

primary and the 60 days before the -- the general

election, that corporation could look at this Court's

definition of a sham.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, no.

The point would be in

October either -- do exactly what this Court said at

11

page 206 of the McConnell opinion:

12

in terms that doesn't expressly refer to the candidate

13

which, if you're not interested in influencing the

14

candidate election, shouldn't be a problem, or fund

15

that one advertisement through a separate, segregated

16

fund.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But on an issue like

18

this, the filibuster, it's the Senators who are doing

19

it, and their ad referred to not only the Senator who

20

was up for election, but the one who was not.

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I understand that, Mr. Chief

22

Justice, but I think if you focus in on this particular

23

ad, you will see that whatever the true intent of the

24

advertisers here, this is the kind of ad that clearly

25

would have an impact on the election.

I mean, it talks

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

about the -- the filibusters in colorful terms,

2

associates them with gridlock and with a state of

3

emergency, and then associates it with a candidate.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You think Congress has the

5

power to prohibit any First Amendment contact --

6

conduct that might have an impact on the election?

7

mean, is that the criterion for whether it -- it can be

8

prohibited?

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I

No, Justice Scalia, it's not.

10

But I think what this Court very clearly did in

11

McConnell is it rejected an argument that said that the

12

only thing that Congress could regulate is that which

13

was unambiguously targeted at candidate elections.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you think there is a

15

compelling interest in preventing people from thinking

16

about an issue and then calling their Senator during

17

the blackout period.

18

that, in effect, you are arguing for.

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That's the compelling interest

No, Justice Kennedy.

What

20

we're arguing for stems from the observation that this

21

Court made in McConnell, which is that when you get up

22

between 60 days before an election and you look at the

23

ads that are run, most of the ads, in fact, are

24

designed to influence candidate elections.

25

difficult to figure out exactly which ones, and there

No, Justice Kennedy.

I

13

think the fact that there are alternative methods

14

available to communicate these ideas in these ads is a

15

virtue, not a defect with this regulatory structure.

16
17
18

And I would like to focus in on these ads
because while it is true that -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, why -- why not?

19

Suppose -- suppose most people look at the Web site and

20

they don't listen to the -- listen to the radio.

21

think certainly McCain-Feingold should be extended to

22

that under your view.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I

Well, Justice Kennedy, I --

24

I'm not sure you really do think that -- that McCain-

an area where this Court, in fairness, has recognized

that -- that any effort to regulate in this area

effectively has to avoid three pitfalls.

Well, I -- I want to be

5

responsive and I think the way to respond is that this

6

Court's decision recognized that these ads were going

7

to be difficult to classify and that you needed some

8

kind of bright line rule and that the consequences of

9

having a bright line rule in this consequence -- in

10

this area weren't terrible because there were

11

alternative ways for them to communicate either through

12

a separate, segregated fund which served the interests

13

of the statute or by avoiding the kind of references

14

that would raise serious questions about tying the ad

15

to a candidate election.

16

And I think if you look at -- if -- if you

17

want to keep the possibility open of some as-applied

18

challenge and you focus on these ads, these are ads

19

that clearly, I think, would implicate the concerns of

20

Congress.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What was the bright line

24

whether it's an issue ad or -- or, rather, a phony

issue ad.

I thought the bright line rule was

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think all issue ads that

come within the statutory prohibition are permissibly

I think -JUSTICE SCALIA:

No issue ads during the --

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Sure, you can run issue ads

10

as long as you either fund them through a separate,

11

segregated fund or you --

the --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Within -- within the

21

framework of the statute, you think the clear line that

22

is established by the opinion is no issue ads without

23

this special funding during the blackout.

24

that's what the opinion says?

I think this Court recognized --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Why does it speak about sham

issue ads?

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, for one

6

thing, I think it's important to recognize that the

7

discussion about sham versus genuine issue ads was

8

really a factor of the fact that necessarily in looking

9

at the record there, what the Court had to do is look

10

at ads that were run in previous election cycles where

11

this regulatory structure wasn't in place and try to

12

classify those ads.

13

genuine versus sham was a way of capturing whether or

14

not it was an ad that seemed primarily focused on an

15

issue or primarily focused on a candidate election.

16
17

And as I understand it, sort of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why did you say there were 7

percent of these that -- that are probably okay?

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I'm not sure which figure Mr.

19

Bopp is referring to as the 7 percent figure.

20

-- I don't remember conceding that 7 percent of the ads

21

were okay.

22

I don't

And I think what we very clearly said -- and

23

if you go back and look at our briefs, as I did, I

24

think you'll see this.

25

and the Court picked up on it in that line on page 206

What we very clearly said --

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that Justice O'Connor read earlier -- is that whatever

2

was true about a retrospective analysis of ads that

3

were run in an election cycle that wasn't governed by

4

the statute, that in the future corporations could

5

avoid the -- the strictures of the statute by simply

6

doing one of two things:

7

express reference to the candidate, which ought not to

8

be too difficult if you're really just engaged in issue

9

advocacy, not trying to influence a candidate election,

10

or alternatively, you can fund it through the separate,

11

segregated fund.

12

either avoiding making an

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I deny the first thing,

13

that it's easy to do issue ads without naming the

14

candidate.

15

pressure on -- on the candidate that you want to vote

16

your way.

17

not the candidate -- the -- the incumbent that you want

18

to vote your way -- without telling people to call the

19

office of that incumbent, you're not doing very much.

20

The -- the point of an issue ad is to put

Without -- without telling people to call --

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, they

21

didn't even do that in this ad, as has already been

22

pointed out.

23

you can do to stop judicial filibusters, visit

24

befair.org, and avoided a reference to Senator

25

Feingold, they could have run this through their

But they couldn't resist the

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Could they have said in

5

the ad, call your elected representatives, not naming

6

any names?

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

8

also could have done that.

9

Yes, Justice O'Connor, they

And I think that the very fact that they

10

couldn't resist the temptation to link the filibuster

11

issue to Senator Feingold is not that surprising --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

General -That may be because

the people who were doing the filibuster were the

17

It's not -- it's not a surprising thing to

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, and again, Mr. Chief

18

Justice, though, I mean, fair enough, but I think you

19

also have to keep in mind that this is a context where

20

this filibuster issue isn't some idiosyncratic interest

21

of the appellant here.

22

identified as a campaign issue by the -- by -- by the

23

candidates opposing Senator Feingold, by the Wisconsin

Republican Party, and by appellant's own PAC.

2

votes or the election, the timing of this ad strongly

3

suggests it was designed to influence the election.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The fact that it

5

mentions both -- the fact that it mentions both

6

Senators strongly suggests to me that it's concerned

7

about the issue because one of the Senators wasn't up

8

for election.

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that

10

gets back to Justice Stevens' question as to whether or

11

not these categories are mutually exclusive.

12

here to tell you that appellants weren't genuinely

13

issued about -- genuinely interested about the

14

filibuster issue.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's such an odd calculus.

Who is the person more likely to be influenced with an

3

issue ad?

4

not going to run for 4 years?

The person who's running or the person who's

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Obviously --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's -- and that's

7

the one area where the ad is prohibited.

8
9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Obviously, you're right,

Justice Kennedy, but obviously, there are concerns that

10

are implicated when somebody is running in cycle and

11

the ad has targeted the electorate in the immediate

12

run-up to the election that aren't present there with

13

Senator Kohl and, therefore, the Congress has -- has

14

struck a different balance in that case.

15

But just to focus on the timing of these ads,

16

they were run on day 4 of a 45-day August recess of the

17

Senate.

18

do, is to influence a pending legislative vote, is

19

very, very odd timing.

20

on the other hand, you're trying to influence the

21

upcoming election, the timing of that ad makes a great

22

deal of sense.

23

Now, that timing, if what you were trying to

It could hardly be worse.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

perfect timing to influence the Senators who are the

ones engaging in the filibuster --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

I'm not sure I would --- without regard to

whether they're running for election or not.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect, Mr. Chief

7

Justice, I'm not sure I'd pick day 4 of the August

recess to do that.

9

back, something like that, would be an appropriate time

Maybe 14 days before they're going

10

to catch their attention in a -- in a period where

11

they're going to remember it when they go and vote.

12

But I think day 4 of a 45-day recess is probably not

13

when I would pick to start running these ads.

14

I don't suggest, though, the timing factor or

15

any other one factor ought to be dispositive.

what it goes to show is how difficult it would be to

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Have

Well, Justice Breyer, let me

answer both questions.
As to the 527 issue, as I understand it, the

17

commission has decided to proceed on case-by-case

18

inquiries and has not tried to have a broad regulatory

19

approach yet.

20

Now, on to the issue of electioneering

21

communications, you're absolutely right that there is a

22

statutory authorization to create exceptions.

23

regulatory authority of the commission is limited, and

24

it's limited in the sense that they can't approve an

25

exception that would allow for ads that engage -- that

3

And what the FEC has found in practice is

4

that it's very difficult to create that kind of

regulatory exception because, as this Court recognized

in Buckley and in McConnell, one does not want to

naively underestimate the creativity of corporate

spenders or political consultants.

careful.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Clement, if you

could clarify for me some -- a response that Mr. Bopp

18

gave.

19

before the blackout period?

Did this ad run, was it broadcast or televised

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, as I

21

understand the record, the first effort to broadcast

22

this ad was on, I think, July 26th, and that was sort

23

of a few days before the -- the cutoff period would

24

kick in.

25

to broadcast this ad.

So there was an effort by a matter of weeks
But I think, you know, whether

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

one views that as setting the stage for this litigation

2

or being kind of an independent decision, I'll -- I'll

3

leave to others.

4

What I think is important, though, is that

5

although they were engaged on this issue before then,

6

up until that point, they had found it perfectly

7

satisfactory to engage on the issue without engaging in

8

broadcast advertisement.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you one other

10

thing about the setting?

11

to get further information, what was conveyed about

12

Senator Feingold when you went to get that further

13

information?

14

When you went to the Web site

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

15

-- I don't have as good an answer for that as I would

16

like because the -- the Web site is now defunct.

17

so maybe Mr. Bopp can answer that in rebuttal.

18

And

As I understand it, consistent with what

19

Justice Breyer said, that there was sort of additional

20

arguments about the Feingold record on -- on

21

filibusters and Senator Kohl's record on filibusters,

22

and then there was -- there was information about how

23

to contact them.

24
25

But I think, again, as -- as Mr. Bopp has
said, if -- if you don't find the broadcast medium a

46
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

particularly effective way to convey the phone numbers

2

and you have to reference people to the Web site

3

anyways, the very fact that you could reference them to

4

the Web sites without naming the candidates' names and

5

avoid the strictures entirely seems like the kind of

6

thing that this Court had in mind when it said on page

7

206 that there were ways to deal with this problem

8

prospectively and that you didn't need a as-applied

9

challenge like this one.

10
11

And again, I think you can't overestimate the
difficulties here because --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

General Clement, you --

13

you've pointed out the difficulties, but I don't know

14

any other area where we said, well, you know, the --

15

the -- when you're dealing with important -- important

16

freedoms, important guarantees, where we shrug our

17

shoulders and say, well, the only way to accomplish

18

right over those guarantees.

We don't have a scalpel to probe that either.

But

6

we're going to approve 100 feet because it's a basic

way of dealing with this problem, identifying the area

find something on one side or the other.

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well but, Justice Kennedy,

2

precisely because you can't engage in just a formless

3

content-based inquiry and precisely because there isn't

4

any neat division between issue ads and candidate ads,

5

that is why you need to have a different regulatory

6

approach.

7

I mean, this Court recognized -JUSTICE STEVENS:

I think the real bottom

8

line for the -- your opponent is that even a pure

9

election ad should get the same constitutional

10

protection as an issue ad, which is something we've

11

rejected.

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Absolutely, Justice Stevens.

13

And of course, an even position one step intermediary

14

from that or one step backtracking from that would be

15

to say that all Congress can do in this area is

16

regulate those ads that are unambiguously election

17

oriented.

18

ads?

And, of course, what's the class of those

Well, that would be express advocacy.

19

And the one thing that I think is clear from

20

this Court's decision in McConnell is this Court made

21

clear that express advocacy is not a constitutional

22

line.

ads that are -- yes, they have a component of issue

conclusion that a substantial amount of the ads covered

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. BOPP:

13

What this -- what plaintiffs are relying upon

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

14

here is the distinction that this Court has made

15

between lobbying, on the one hand, and political

16

campaigns on the other.

17

Stevens' concurrence in Austin, quote, there is a vast

18

difference between lobbying and debating public issues,

19

on the one hand, and political campaigns for election

20

to public office on the other hand.

21

because that the interests that have justified the

22

regulation of corporate electioneering do not apply to

As summarized by Justice

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And that is

categories.

MR. BOPP:

I think they do, and they drew a

line that was upheld on its face because the vast

majority of ads --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And -- and if we are in a

7

gray area that there's some who could say it's issue

8

and some could say it's electioneering, do we owe any

9

deference to Congress' test that it has drafted?

10

MR. BOPP:

I -- I don't think you owe

11

deference to the test.

12

the fidelity of the Constitution, and the Constitution

So it is a difficult question.

It's fact-

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So your position basically

17

would say we should take all of these cases on a case-

18

by-case basis and not give any presumptive weight to

19

what -- what Congress has done.

20

MR. BOPP:

No.

I think that you can draw a

21

rule that relies on objective criteria, just as you

22

have in the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, to distinguish

23

between illegitimate efforts to -- for predatory

24

anticompetitive practices or monopolies, to distinguish

25

between those and -- and -- the Court has even used the

4

That has been based on objective criteria as

criteria to distinguish lawsuits that fall within the

19

there -- there is a bright line distinction between an

20

election and Parliament actually exercising

governmental power.

when the Constitution demands the recognition of the

right to petition, then that needs to be dealt with in

this as-applied challenge.

individuals have to participate in that Government.

13

It's not just about elections.

about lawmaking and citizens have a robust right to

participate in that lawmaking power, and as a result,

this Court should recognize an as-applied exception for
