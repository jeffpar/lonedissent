ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE BAKER CHATMAN

We'll hear argument

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. CHATMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit decision in the court below

11

was wrong, for three reasons.

12

frustrates Congress's intent to protect Federal Courts

13

from hearing stale claims and to respect the finality

14

of State Court convictions.

15

and arbitrarily adopting a conclusive presumption that

16

misunderstands or ignores State law and practice.

17

it is inconsistent with this Court's decision in Carey

18

versus Saffold.

19

It adopted a rule that

It does so by improperly

And

If the Federal Courts, on the other hand,

20

complete their analysis of the Federal question of

21

tolling the AEDPA statute of limitations by deciding

22

whether a State petition was timely before granting

23

tolling, it can properly dismiss more Federal petitions

24

on statute-of-limitations grounds and can avoid

25

litigating stale claims on the merits.

Any

Alderson Reporting Company

1

difficulties in doing so can be ameliorated by the

2

limited nature of the State-law inquiry and adoption of

3

a 60-day presumption of timeliness.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's something --

5

where would we -- we would just pick that number, that

6

--

7

MS. CHATMAN:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9
10

The 60 days?
Yes.

Because that's a

normal appeal period?
MS. CHATMAN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, when

11

California does look to timeliness in proceeding from

12

one lower court to a higher court, then we see that it

13

contemplates that a -- that a litigant will proceed in

14

60 days or less, because -- and the reason we have to

15

turn to analogies is because nothing in California law

16

requires the appellate courts in State habeas to look

17

to that particular period of time between the lower

18

court decision and proceeding to that court, because

19

they're courts of original jurisdiction.

20

at how long the prisoner proceeded from conviction to

21

their court, as a whole.

22

So, they look

But the reason that we need to figure out

23

this period is because this Court, in Carey versus

24

Saffold, has said that our system functions enough like

25

an appellate system to bring those periods into the

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

tolling provision.

So, when --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. CHATMAN:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, can't --

-- we look --- the -- can't the

5

California courts adopt a -- give us a 60-day rule, or

6

a 30-day rule, or a 90-day rule?

7

it, why should we do it?

8
9

MS. CHATMAN:
done so.

And if they don't do

Up to this point, they have not

And I think that is because, as I said, they

10

are looking at the time from conviction.

11

it take the prisoner to get to their court with their

12

claims?

13

proceeding up the ladder through the courts is just one

14

factor that they look at.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

How long did

And how -- and how long they take properly

And they -I don't know how this came

have had a chance to answer.

opinion on this.

22

I don't know -- did you ask for en banc?

I mean -- I mean, I'm asking both sides the

23
24
25

It'll sound very favorable to you, but

So, I want your honest

I don't know how this happened.

MS. CHATMAN:

And

I'm sorry, how the 3-year delay

happened?
JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

I don't know how the

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

California Court could have read the opinion -- which,

2

of course, I wrote for the Court, so maybe I am reading

3

things into it that weren't there -- but I don't know

4

how any judge could read that opinion we wrote and come

5

to this conclusion.

6

on -- that there are three issues -- what's the word

7

"pending"?

8

period between when the lower court decides a case and

9

you appeal?

I thought that it said, you know,

Does the word "pending" apply to the time

That's typically 20 days or 30 days.

10

MS. CHATMAN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
Are those 20 days or 30 days

12

counted in the tolling period?

13

clearly said the answer is yes.

14

California, and they don't have the words "20 days" or

15

"30 days."

16

said, "Still applies, because 'reasonable time' is

17

probably 20 or 30 days."

18

different rule; it's a similar rule.

19

part three, and it says, "This is 45 days."

20

no 4 and a half months, wasn't it?

Then we looked at

They say "reasonable time."

And then we

They don't have a radically

21

MS. CHATMAN:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

I thought part one

Then we come to
There's --

Uh-huh.
This isn't just 20 or 30

days.

24

MS. CHATMAN:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.
So, is it timely?

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. CHATMAN:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.
And, there, I thought the

3

Court said -- I mean, I was reading it -- say, "Well,

4

it's hard to say, because there might have been excuses

5

for the delay."

6

there, "on the merits"?

What about the words that were written

7

MS. CHATMAN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MS. CHATMAN:

And there was an equitable- -On --

-- -tolling question.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MS. CHATMAN:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that had nothing to --

Right.
-- do with the case.

The

13

lack of diligence had nothing to do with this aspect of

14

the case.

15

And there, what I think the court wrote is that the

16

fact that it says "on the merits" doesn't prove it --

17

what -- it doesn't prove that it was timely.

18

then I listed a bunch of reasons.

19

Sometimes courts say "on the merits," even though it's

20

delayed.

21

because they want to tell the prisoner or -- there are

22

a lot of reasons why, all of which are listed.

23

send it back to see whether this 4-and-a-half-month

24

delay, given the excuses, was still timely.

25

right?

But, what about the words "on the merits"?

All right?

Why?

And

There are reasons.

They say "on the merits."

Or

So, we

MS. CHATMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Now --

Justice --- we now get a case where

it's 3 years.

6

MS. CHATMAN:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.
And the court says, "It's

8

timely, because they used the word 'on the merits.'"

9

But I thought -- I said, in the opinion, I thought the

10

court adopted that the words "on the merits" do not

11

decide the matter.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't it --

ask the Ninth Circuit to say, "Look, this is not --

read the opinion, read what they said.

12

MS. CHATMAN:

Correct it."

This is not the first time that

13

we have tried to take that approach with the Ninth

14

Circuit on this issue.

15

versus Carey, they made the same mistake, and the

16

rehearing has got us nowhere -- asking for a rehearing.

17

And so, we felt that in order to get this clarified as

They -- on remand, in Saffold

18

soon as possible, it seems futile to ask for rehearing

19

when on the -- when we had not been successful before.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MS. CHATMAN:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

Well this --

This is, by the way --- this case is different,

23

actually, from the one that Justice Breyer put,

24

because, in this case, the California Supreme Court

25

didn't say --

MS. CHATMAN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- "on the merits."

nothing at all.

question presented is quite different.

It just disposed of it.

It said

So, the

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's worse.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's whether -- not whether

7

it can be, nonetheless, timely when they say "on the

8

merits," but whether it can be, nonetheless, timely

9

when they don't say anything at all.

10

MS. CHATMAN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

But -I would think it's an a

fortiori case, in other words.

13

MS. CHATMAN:

And the Ninth Circuit is

14

treating it as if it were the same sort of decision

15

that was before this Court in Carey versus Saffold.

16

is a decision on the merits.

17

as excluding any other possible grounds that might have

18

existed for the denial in that case.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

It

And they are reading that

20

attorney general of California, and you have a lot of

litigation in the Ninth Circuit.

think we should do?

1

and they --

2

MS. CHATMAN:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.
-- it seems to perhaps,

4

inadvertently or not -- and the reason I turn to you

5

is, judges are busy, they have huge dockets --

6

MS. CHATMAN:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
And, often, unless it's very

8

clearly pointed out by the lawyers, or the lawyers take

9

action, you get -- waste everybody's time and money.

10

MS. CHATMAN:

Uh-huh.

Well, I think the

11

answer is to instruct the Federal Courts that, when

12

they're undertaking this inquiry of whether an

13

application is pending during the intervals, a Federal

14

question that has a State-law component, then they must

15

apply the State law to figure out if it's timely.

16

you know, as this Court said in Carey the -- versus

17

Saffold -- it's a matter of whether it's timely; it's

18

not a matter of the basis of the State Court decision.

19

And in the context of California, I think the answer

20

is to adopt a presumption of 60 days, because that is

21

the most analogous --

22
23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And,

In -- even if, as he

alleged, he was unable to do anything in --

24

MS. CHATMAN:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Uh-huh.
This is a layperson.

He

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

said, "I tripped in the intermediate appellate court,

2

because I didn't do any research.

3

do better, but they gave me a job where, during the

4

hours that the library was open" --

5

MS. CHATMAN:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

And so, I wanted to

Uh-huh.
-- "I had to be at work.

And that's why it took me all this time."

8

MS. CHATMAN:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Uh-huh.
Now, is that -- suppose

10

the prison locks down someone and says, "You can't go to

11

the library."

12

MS. CHATMAN:

This is an easy decision for

13

the Federal Court, even on these facts.

14

Petitioner has taken longer than 60 days, and he's

15

offered an explanation.

16

explanation, on its face, it's completely inadequate to

17

account for a 3-year delay, because he doesn't take

18

action to get -- to get library access for an entire

19

year after the Court of Appeals decision denying his

20

application is issued.

21

correctly, going through the administrative procedures

of the prison to get a job change.

problems with that assertion; the first being, it

wasn't presented to the State Court, so it's -- it

19

cannot cure his State untimeliness.

20

that he doesn't offer specific dates or explain how it

21

22

problem is that State prisons provide procedures during

large number of these cases disposed of by a postcard.
Would there be anything wrong if the California
Supreme Court said, "We're going to have two postcards.
One says that 'the delay was unreasonable, denied';

5

and the other said, 'there's nothing to the merits,

6

denied'" -- you use two postcards -- wouldn't that solve

7

all the problems?

8

MS. CHATMAN:

The problem with that is --

certainly, it would solve things, but the problem with

that is, it would require the -- require the California

11

courts to make both of those determinations in every

case.

like --

14

And, as it is now, they use a procedure much

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But they could adopt a 60-

15

day rule, or a 90-day rule, and then just, when they

decided to not follow the rule, they'd put a check on -

- say, "Well, we did look at the merits in this case."

MS. CHATMAN:

They could do that -Under our current law, it

3

said, "You know, sometimes 'merits' don't mean merits."

4

But if the State were to revise its procedure and say,

And we said, you know, "That's

5

"We're either going to say A or we're going to say B,

6

and that's our reason," and they said, "It's on the

7

merits" or "it's untimely," wouldn't it make sense for

8

us, even in the light of Carey, to say, "Okay, we'll

9

accept that as the -- as the State's reason"?

10

MS. CHATMAN:

If they were to do that.

11

don't anticipate the State Courts adopting that

12

practice, because it would double their work.

13

would have to make both decisions, merits and

14

untimeliness.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MS. CHATMAN:

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I

They

I don't --

It --- see why.

If they're

18

going to follow something like a prima facie 60-day

19

rule, and it's -- it's on day 65, all they've got to

20

say is, "It's untimely."

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MS. CHATMAN:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, in this --

But the --- in this case, in order to

24

determine it was untimely, they would have presumably

25

had to have gone into the factual analysis of whether

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

the prison was on lockdown, whether he delayed for a

2

year after getting the materials, and all of that

3

stuff.

4

of it seem to them absolutely clear, to simply deny it

5

on the merits and not reach the "timely" question.

So, it's a lot easier for them, when the merits

6

MS. CHATMAN:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that -But the "timely" question is

8

still before Federal Courts.

Carey versus Saffold.

So --

10

MS. CHATMAN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

That's what we said in

I agree.

And they --

-- although they can avoid

it, we can't.

13

MS. CHATMAN:

And that -- and that is the way

14

the State Courts are approaching these cases.

15

for the most part, will look first for a prima facie

16

case, and in -- much like the Federal Courts do in

17

Federal habeas under Rule 4, where they scream for

18

frivolous petitions that can be dismissed outright

19

individual California Courts.

Justice Brown described that as "an abstraction," and

former Justice Moss described it as "vague and

cases.

And that's why former

But that's what the

So, to put it context for a moment, the way
the State Courts do enforce this on a case-by-case

10

basis, to be practical, is, the State Supreme Court

11

often summarily dismisses cases on procedural bars,

12

including timeliness.

13

from the Warden's brief, in 2004 there were 1,223

14

unexplained summary denials -- in other words, just

15

denied -- and there were 1,174 denials with a citation

16

to a case.

17

that, in about half of the cases in 2004 that went to

18

the California Supreme Court, they enforced one of

19

their procedural bars, and, in many of them, it was

20

timeliness.

21

And this is significant, because this means

So, the difficulty

of

looking to that, which may be a good difficulty -- I

35
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

mean, that is a serious problem, but I thought what we

2

wrote in the case -- see, there are two problems here.

3

First, which was bothering me, had to do with our

4

Court's relation to the Ninth Circuit, which may be

5

simple and -- as far as legally is concerned -- but I'm

6

not sure about it.

7

interesting, is what you're talking about.

8
9

The other, which is much more

All right, now, on the first one, I read the
words.

It says the words "on the merits."

The Ninth

10

Circuit thought those three words meant that the

11

California Supreme Court could not have considered the

12

petition too late, for, after all, it decided it on the

13

merits, just as with the cite.

14

words are right or wrong that follow, that's what we

20

or because it wants to give the reviewing court

alternative grounds for decision, or maybe it just

wants to show the prisoner we thought about the claim

24

25

lot of reasons.

Now, whether these

The next words were, "There are many plausible

So, there are a

And it says, "Conclusion."

Given the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

variety of reasons why they might have put the words

2

"on the merits," the fact that they are there, those

3

words cannot, by themselves, show that the petition was

4

timely.

5

wrote is, "When the California Court denies a habeas

6

petition without comment or citation, we have long

7

treated the denial as a decision on the merits."

8
9
10

So, then I read what they wrote.

And then it cites a pre-Carey case.

What they

Okay?

"Therefore, the

summary denial was on the merits, and the petition was
not dismissed as untimely," citing two pre-Carey cases.

11

Now, I don't see how, since I just said the

12

words "on the merits do not end the issue" -- here, the

13

words weren't even there, but they say, "We're treating

14

it as if they were, and that ends the issue."

15

do we do about that?

16

So, what

Then the next question, once I figure that

17

one out, is, What do we do about the issue you're

18

raising, which is quite important and interesting and

19

so forth?

20

MR. STRIS:

Okay.

Well, as to the first

21

question, the explanation that you just provided

22

clearly requires the Federal Courts, when there's some

23

indication from the State Court that it might have been

24

untimely, to look into it.

25

problem with what the Ninth Circuit did in that case.

And that was the very

37
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

It said "on the merits and for lack of diligence."

2

to presume that that was just on the merits, that's

3

flatly wrong.

4

investigation.

5

So,

You'd need to do some further

In light of the context of what's happening

6

in California, however, when the State Court says

7

nothing, there has to be some process by which the

8

Federal Court can make a decision as to what that

9

means, because if, in fact, in that case it was denied

10

on the merits and the State Court thought it was

11

timely, it would be extremely invasive for the Federal

12

Court to re-review the case, potentially come to a

13

different conclusion, and, we would suggest,

14

dramatically alter the landscape of how prisoners

15

exhaust their remedies in California, because now

16

you're developing a Federal body of law that may be

17

very different in deciding what's substantial and

18

what's reasonable than California did.

19

the Ninth Circuit, I believe, did in this case was look

20

to context and come up with the presumption that was

21

most reasonable in light of what's going on.

22
23
24
25

And so, what

So, the first thing that is relevant, from a

MR. STRIS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The answer -- pardon me -It doesn't want to say

"denied on the merits," because that would suggest that

11

it was timely.

12

MR. STRIS:

The answer, I would suggest,

13

Justice Scalia, requires looking to California

14

practice.

15

California Supreme Court's decision in In re Sanders.

16

And in In re Sanders, the Court made clear that after

17

the Supreme Court adopted their policies in 1989

18

regarding certain presumptions in capital cases, and

19

after the seminal In re Clark case in 1993, which

20

asserted -- rather, articulated California's timeliness

21

standards, most petitions -- and these are the

22

California Supreme Court's words -- "Most petitions are

23

timely filed."

24

that half of the California Supreme Court's cases are

25

being denied with a case citation, it's reasonable to

And where I would start is with the

So, with that backdrop and the fact

39
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

conclude that the unexplained denials are not

2

necessarily untimely.

3

Now, I would add to that --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know what it --

5

"most" is 51 percent.

6

don't know whether it was the merits or not, there

7

could be a lot of ones where the timeliness is simply

8

not decided upon.

9

MR. STRIS:

I mean, among those that you

It's certainly the case, Justice

10

Scalia, that the presumptions the Ninth Circuit adopted

Courts would consider to be untimely --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, we could work with

14

that.

say "most are timely filed," then the next question

16

would be, "All right, what period of time is it?"

I can't really answer that, and

that's at the heart of --

MR. STRIS:

Well, the reason I would suggest

2

that -- and answering that is not necessarily

appropriate or helpful in resolving the question -- is

4

because of the series of cases that we quoted in

that there was a paging system, but the documentary

It doesn't suggest changing it for

To do what?

What would it

say?
MR. STRIS:

I believe it replaces the word

"pending" with some replacement.

And so, it

10

essentially changes the tolling provision to account

11

for this problem.

12

now, we have a congressional statute that, on its face,

13

does not require the Federal Courts --

14

But that hasn't happened yet.

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about this?

Right

You might

15

lose under this, but it -- see, so you say -- look, in

16

every other State, the time for appealing from an

17

appeals court to the State Supreme Court, asking them,

18

is 20 days, normally, or sometimes 30.

19

Ninth Circuit gets a case in which it was longer than

20

30 days, then, irrespective of whether they say "on the

21

merits," whether they cite a case, whether they don't

22

say anything and just have a postcard, what the Ninth

23

Circuit should assume that they've done is consider it

24

untimely, in the absence of the kind of excuse that the

25

California Courts might accept as an excuse.

So, if the

future, wants something different -- which I'd be

3

surprised -- they will say that their system means that

4

a 3-year delay, or whatever it is, is actually timely.

5

But, in the absence of some reason to think that, why

6

not use the words, which would give you a chance to go

7

back, and you could say, "This is not a case of total

8

lack of excuse.

9

California would accept."

10

And if California, in the

There is excuse of the kind that

MR. STRIS:

Well, I think the problem with

11

that sort of rule, Justice Breyer, is that it risks

12

error, because California's standard is so

13

indeterminate, and at very little -- it gets very

14

little benefit.

15

harm -- there's no real harm to the Federal interest

16

here just because we have a conclusive presumption.

17

The very nature of a conclusive presumption is that

18

sometimes there will be cases that don't fit the

19

presumption.

20

seen from my review of California procedure, there's

21

nothing to suggest that a -- the Federal interest in

22

avoiding substantial delays is compromised by the

23

specific rule that the Ninth Circuit has adopted.

MR. STRIS:

We do have a Federal rule and a

I would say two things about

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

The first thing is, I would

10

strongly resist your characterization that the State

11

Court is saying nothing.

12

they are saying something, and that, in the cases that

13

involve postcard denials, many of them, the court is

14

saying that they're timely, and, in others, those are

15

the hard questions.

16

characterization to the fact that California is not

17

saying something in some cases.

I think that, in most cases,

So, I would restrict your

18

Now, because the Federal statute necessarily

19

imports a State standard, that's the very problem with

20

the statute.

21

I can conceive of many instances where --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why do you think the

22

Federal statute necessarily imports a State standard?

23

It says that the State postconviction proceeding must

24

be pending.

25

situation, but we interpret that pending is a question

And California presents an unusual

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

of Federal law.

2

It's not a State standard.

MR. STRIS:

That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

But if you took that to its logical conclusion, then,

4

when State Courts made errors -- they didn't see that a

5

case was properly filed, they just missed it -- the

6

Federal Court would go in and review.

7

where they did claim the reverse, the Federal Court

8

could say, "No, there was clear error."

has rejected that in Saffold.

Or in a case

But this Court

It's rejected it in

that the tolling provision was included to encourage

interference.

And the problem is that the rule announced in

And so, the solution that the Ninth Circuit

10

has adopted -- that's our proposal.

11

think that it has a minimal harm to Federal interests,

12

because maybe certain cases will get in that Congress

didn't intend, but if you don't adopt it, there's no

14

alternative.

15

California, you can't certify to the Court of Appeal.

16

You can't certify from a District Court.

17

California State Courts aren't going to change, it's

18

not incumbent upon this Court to read the statute

19

differently than the proper interpretation.

20

concede the arguments that were made in the dissenting

21

opinion in Saffold are very interesting, and they don't

22

compel, in my opinion, a different interpretation of

23

the statute; they recognize the difficulty that the

statute presents.

difficult to deal with.

5

questions about California?

6

discussing, with these long delays, primarily in the

7

application the third range, the application of the

8

California Supreme Court, as opposed to lower courts?

9

MR. STRIS:

Is the problem we're

Well, I wouldn't characterize it

10

as a problem, because, like I said before, I don't

11

think that --

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But is the condition, that

13

there is the long delay, that primarily occurs in the -

14

- in the application of State Supreme Court?

15

MR. STRIS:

Is it --

I have no -- I've seen no

16

specific evidence to be able to answer that with any

17

citation, but my understanding, Justice Stevens, is

18

that that makes sense, because it's the last process

19

that the prisoner is going to be able to engage in,

20

then they'll have to go to the Federal Circuit.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Then my second question is,

22

Have we decided, or is it a matter of common practice

in California, that the application to the California

24

Supreme Court is necessary in order to complete the

exhaustion?
