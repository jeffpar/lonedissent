ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. MORAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Over the last 50 years, courts in virtually

11

every American jurisdiction have suppressed evidence

12

seized inside homes following knock-and-announce

13

violations -- including this Court, on two occasions.

14

Those suppression orders reflect an understanding of

15

two points key to this appeal.

16

that the manner of entry -- and, in particular, a

17

knock-and-announce violation -- is not somehow

18

independent of the police activity that occurs inside

19

the house.

20

Wilson, the reasonableness of police activity inside

21

a home is dependent on the manner of the police

22

entry.

23

The first point is

And, as this Court directly recognized in

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

May I ask you whether

24

there are statutes in various States that allow an

25

officer to get a no-knock warrant?

MR. MORAN:
O'Connor.

4

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. MORAN:

I do not believe so, Justice

O'Connor.

7
8

And does Michigan have

such a statute?

5
6

Yes, there are, Justice

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

How common are those

statutes?

9

MR. MORAN:

I believe about half the States

10

have such no-knock -- no-knock statutes.

11

Michigan, a police officer -- if the -- if the

12

circumstances on the scene justify a no-knock entry,

13

then the officer is permitted, by case law and, of

14

course, by the precedents of this Court, to go ahead

15

and do so.

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So, in

Why would an officer,

17

without such permission, want to make a no-knock

18

entry while possessing a warrant --

19

MR. MORAN:

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

21

MR. MORAN:

Well --- a search warrant?

-- as this case illustrates,

22

sometimes officers believe that it is to their

23

advantage to perform a no-knock entry, or to fail to

24

comply with the knock-and-announce requirement.

25

that is why --

And

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

2

MR. MORAN:

Why?

Well, Officer Good apparently

3

thought that his safety would be better served he if

4

disregarded the knock-and-announce requirement; and

5

so, he candidly testified, at the evidentiary

6

hearing, that it's essentially his policy, in drug

7

cases, to go in without a -- without performing the

8

necessary knock-and-announce.

9

after the -- this Court's decision in Richards,

And that was 1 year

10

saying that there is no per-se exclusion of drug

11

cases from the knock-and-announce requirement.

12

But that brings me to the second reason why

13

courts have almost universally, until the Stevens

14

case in 1999, held that suppression of evidence is

15

necessary, and that is deterrence; because, without

16

the suppression of evidence, there is very little

17

chance that the officers will be deterred from

18

routinely violating the knock-and-announce

19

requirement, from adopting a sort of personal

20

violation of the requirement, just as --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know, I'd be

22

worried -- you know, bust in somebody's door -- that

23

the homeowner wouldn't shoot me.

24

that I'm the police, he had every reason to believe

25

he's under attack.

Without announcing

Isn't that a considerable

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

deterrent?
MR. MORAN:

Yes, that's the one purpose of

3

the knock-and-announce requirement that doesn't

4

protect the homeowner's interest, that protects the

5

officer's interest --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. MORAN:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. MORAN:

Exactly.

-- against being shot.
Right.

However, what we'll see then,

10

if there is no exclusion of evidence following knock-

11

and-announce rules, are entries precisely like the

12

one we have here, where the officers will, in fact,

13

announce -- they yell, "Police, search warrant" --

14

but then they'll immediately go in.

15

said that he went in real fast.

16

took him just a few seconds to get in the door.

17

that's what they'll do.

18

officers will announce, because they'll want the --

Officer Good

He went in, and it
So,

They'll announce -- some

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. MORAN:

Yes.

-- people inside to know that

21

they're police, but they will not wait for a refusal,

22

and they certainly will not wait for a reasonable

23

amount of time for some --

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure I agree with

a point that you make in your brief that civil

the case when we first adopted the exclusionary rule,

3

but our docket is crowded with 1983 cases brought by

4

prisoners, brought by convicted felons, and many of

5

these cases are successful below.

6

there to believe that that wouldn't be an adequate

7

deterrent?

8
9

MR. MORAN:

That might have been

What reason is

Simply, Justice Scalia, that,

as far as we can determine, no one wins a knock-and-

10

announce case, or we haven't been able to find a

11

single case in which someone has actually recovered

12

damages for a knock-and-announce violation.

13

this --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, if

Is that because the

15

damages are slight or because there's a defense that

16

is successful?

17

tort cases?

18

What has been the defense in these

MR. MORAN:

Both, Justice Ginsburg.

First

19

of all, in many cases, such as this one, where the

20

police don't actually destroy the door, it would be

21

very hard to quantify the damages, and it would be

22

very hard to find a lawyer to take a case such as

23

this.

24

immunities, tort immunities.

25

actions, there are qualified immunities that make it

But the second barrier is the various

difficult to win a suit.

2

bright line as to when the police officers have to

3

knock and announce, and when they do not -- that is,

4

Is there a reasonable suspicion that a quick entry or

5

a no-knock entry will be met with violence or that

6

the evidence will be destroyed? -- courts tend to be

7

very generous in granting qualified immunity to

8

officers -- that is, concluding that some reasonable

9

officers might have concluded that it was justified

And because it is not a

10

to dispense with the knock-and-announcement

11

requirement.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, that same

13

problem exists if the consequence is exclusion of

14

evidence.

15
16

Courts are going to view it the same way.

You're not going to avoid that problem by excluding
evidence.

17

MR. MORAN:

Well, there -- but there is not

18

a qualified-immunity defense to the exclusionary

19

rule.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. MORAN:

22
23

Well --

And so, if the Court concluded

-JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I mean, your point

24

is, it's very hard to tell whether they waited long

25

enough, right?

And that's why they don't win a lot

true if the consequence of not waiting long enough is

3

the exclusion of the evidence.

4

be very -- it's going to be very difficult to tell if

5

they waited long enough, and, as you say, the court

6

is likely to say, you know, "Let it go."

7

But the same thing is going to be

MR. MORAN:

The court is going to

That's true, to some extent,

8

Justice Scalia, but, as an empirical matter, I've

9

cited many cases, in my brief, over the last 50 years

10

where courts from a vast majority of American

11

jurisdictions have found knock-and-announce

12

violations in criminal cases, and have, therefore,

13

excluded the evidence, including this Court, on two

14

occasions, 1958 and 1968.

15

and-announce violations in criminal cases.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

did not raise that issue.

18

in those cases, was it?

19
20

MR. MORAN:

So, courts do find knock-

Our two cases did not -The issue was not decided

The issue of a knock-and-

announce violation leading to exclusion of evidence--

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. MORAN:

Right.

-- was decided.

The -- there

23

was not an inevitable-discovery issue raised in those

24

two cases, because those cases predated the

25

inevitable-discovery doctrine.

But, of course, in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

1958 and 1968, this Court was very familiar with the

2

independent-source doctrine.

3

argument that the Michigan Supreme Court has adopted

4

-- they call it an inevitable-discovery argument;

5

it's really an independent-source doctrine.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And, really, the

You don't -- you

7

don't dispute the application of the inevitable-

discovery principle here, do you?

Chief Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. MORAN:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

No, the -And you don't

dispute that the purpose of the knock-and-announce

rule is not to allow the targets of the search to

16

dispose of evidence, or anything of that sort.

17

MR. MORAN:

Absolutely not.

The purpose of

18

the knock-and-announce rule is to protect the

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, how would you

2

describe the privacy interest that the knock-and-

4

MR. MORAN:

Well, I think this Court has

5

described it well in the -- in its most recent cases

6

-- in Banks and Richards, in particular, as well as

7

Ramirez and Wilson -- that it is a right against

8

being terrified by having the police come in.

16

at all to the items that are the target of the

18

MR. MORAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.
And so, why should

20

the remedy for the violation be to exclude those

items?

discovered.

The privacy that's protected isn't the

requirement is also to protect the sanctity and the

work.

-- I think it's --- just on the point of

the causal relation that the Chief Justice was

exploring, I mean, there is a causal relation in a

We know that.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MORAN:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
I suppose the position of

3

the Respondent is that the minute there's an entry

4

after the knock violation -- the no-knock violation -

5

- the minute there's an entry, that injury ceases, so

6

that it's different from a warrantless rummaging-

7

around through drawers and so forth.

8

would be their argument.

9

MR. MORAN:

I suppose that

I think that is their argument,

10

Justice Kennedy, and I respectfully disagree with it.

11

As a historical matter, even the early English cases

12

recognized that when an officer illegally entered --

13

a sheriff illegally entered a home with a valid writ,

14

that officer became a trespasser, and the activity

15

that he performed in the home was, therefore,

16

illegal.

17

American cases, from the 1830s and 1840s, holding

18

that when an officer had a valid writ to seize a

19

debtor's goods, but illegally entered the home, then

20

that writ became no good; and, therefore, the officer

21

-- the sheriff, in those cases -- could be sued, not

22

only for the illegal entry, but also for the seizure

23

of the goods that he had a valid warrant, or a valid

24

writ, to seize, and that that --

25

In the reply brief, I cited several early

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but here it was a

warrant to enter the home, not to seize particular

goods.

The entering of the home was perfectly okay.

6

quite a different issue, and the causality is quite

7

different.

10

So, the entry of the home was not illegal.
What

It seems to me that's quite a different --

MR. MORAN:

Well, Justice Scalia, I

respectfully disagree that the entry was not illegal.
I believe the entry was illegal, because what a

11

warrant authorizes an -- a -- an officer to do is to

12

make a legal entry.

13

enter however he pleases; it allows the officer to

14

make an entry that complies with the law -- in

15

particular, the fourth amendment.

It does not allow the officer to

They could have performed a legal

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that, but the

19

essence of the violation was not the entering;

20

whereas, in the cases, the old common law cases

21

you're talking about, the essence of the violation

22

was the entering.

23

okay; it was the manner of it, the failure to give

24

the advance notice, that made it bad.

25

seems to me, creates a different situation.

Here, the entering was perfectly

MR. MORAN:

I think, starting in Semayne's

2

case, the Court recognized that even if the officer

3

would have a right to knock down the door after a

4

refusal of entry was obtained, that if the officer

5

did not wait for that refusal, then the entry was

6

illegal.

7

support -- the old English common law cases, starting

8

with Semayne's case -- do support the notion that the

9

entry -- the entry does become illegal if the officer

And so, I think the common law cases do

10

does not wait for the refusal.

11

course, the officer did not wait at all for any

12

refusal, candidly admitted that he went in as soon as

13

he could get through the door, as quickly as he

14

could.

you say, as a matter of case law and practice, that

20

can be done in Michigan?

I don't believe so.

But did

I don't

22

believe that Michigan still allows for no-knock

But that's -- that's

15

actually what's disturbing me about this, because I

16

thought the knock-and-announce rule was a rule that

17

would allow a policeman to go in without knocking and

18

announcing when he has reasonable grounds for

19

thinking he might get shot if he didn't.

20

I read the briefs, I thought maybe that's not how

21

it's being implemented, that the policemen are

22

supposed to run the risk of being shot.

think that was the situation.

said that if there are particular facts about this

particular entry that would make an officer have

reasonable suspicions that he is going to be shot at

officer may dispense with the knock-and-announce

There were no such suspicions in this

The officers had no

information about this particular --

Would it be sufficient if

they don't let people into the house whom they don't

know; and, three, they have guns"?

Well, first of all, Justice

6

Kennedy, I think the law presumes that homeowners

will either make an explicit refusal, "No," or will

answer the door; and primarily that they'll do the

9

latter.

The presumption of the homeowner that we're

10

talking about is an innocent homeowner, somebody who

11

is either -- has nothing to do with whatever the

12

police are looking for.

13

the police are looking for goods that are not

There are many cases where

the homes of people who have nothing, or people who -

So, if we wanted to be

faithful to those common law cases, we wouldn't

MR. MORAN:

I think things have changed,

reason.

10

MR. MORAN:

Well, Justice Stevens -- I

in the sense, first of all, that in those days there

16

because all that you have is a tort suit, which you

on the part of the police officer.

20

If one were to

That, of course, was before

And so, the exclusionary rule, of

in part, in response to the changing circumstances of

remedies were necessary in order to assure compliance

6

with constitutional rights.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The police were no longer under the

In the courts that have

8

allowed this action to go forward, has the rationale

9

been that there is no other effective deterrent to

10

ignoring or violating the knock-and-announce rule?

11

MR. MORAN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

At last

12

count now, 11 State and Federal appellate courts have

13

directly rejected the Michigan Supreme Court's

14

reasoning.

15

the list 2 weeks ago, in a -- in a case that I -- is

16

not cited, because it's so recent.

17

uniformly -- I believe all 11 of those cases have

18

said that, "Were we to hold otherwise, the knock-and-

19

announce rule would become meaningless," a worry that

20

this Court expressed in Richards.

21

very concerned, in Richards, that simply excluding

22

drug cases from the knock-and-announce rule would

23

make the knock-and-announce rule meaningless.

24

these courts have noted that statement -- the courts

25

that came out -- this -- the decisions that came out

The Idaho Court of Appeals just joined

3

if we were to exclude the entire knock-and-announce

4

rule from the exclusionary rule, that there would be

5

virtually no reason for police officers ever to

6

comply with a knock-and-announce requirement.

7

And so, I think the deterrence rationale is

8

a large part of this, and that's what distinguishes

this case from the inevitable-discovery cases, which

10
11

the Michigan Supreme Court relied on.

way to stop the police from making the violation.

20

MR. MORAN:

And I suppose we could punish
We
We

No, it is not enough, but what

21

is critical in this case is that the knock-and-

22

announce violation goes to the manner of entry, and

23

the Court has long recognized that the two predicates

24

for seizure of goods inside a home, or arrest inside

25

a home, are authority to enter the home, which is not

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

contested here, and a lawful entry.

2

one of those two predicates is missing, then you have

3

grounds to suppress the evidence; that is, the

4

evidence inside the home is in the fruit of the

5

unlawful entry.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

it please the Court:

2

The metaphor of "fruit of the poisonous

3

tree" is frequently employed when the exclusionary

4

rule is discussed.

5

apt, because the sanction of exclusion, which is not,

6

itself, constitutionally required, is designed to

7

deter, and to deter in a specific way: to deter by

8

depriving the police of the result -- the fruit, the

9

product, the evidentiary advantage that has been

10

gained by their improper conduct.

11
12

And that metaphor is apt.

of causality must be addressed.

And, in the

That,

What do you say the

purpose of knock-and-announce is?

MR. BAUGHMAN:

This Court has identified it

22

on several occasions as to avoid unnecessary violence

23

to the property, avoid unnecessary possible injury to

24

people, both to the officers who are executing the

25

warrant and people inside, and to allow the person

2

indicated, if they might be in a state of undress or

3

something, they could avoid that embarrassment.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So, I take it your

5

argument is that, except in cases in which the people

6

inside the house are not dressed, or cases in which

7

there is, in fact, a gun battle of some sort, that a

8

knock-and-announce violation will, in fact, never be

the cause of any damage at all.

of the discovery of the physical evidence found --

it'll never be the cause of any compensable damage at

all.

Well, if a -Because I take it your

avoid.

And what I mean by "causation" is the

MR. BAUGHMAN:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if the only harms that

23

the rule is intended to avoid is the exposure of

nakedness and violence, once inside, and there are

cases without nakedness or without violence, then, in

5

7

there would be no recovery, in that circumstance;

8

there would be no damages.

this is why not -- I'm not arguing there was no

In a case such as the instant one, where

There may be cases -- and

10

knock-and-announce violation, in that the police

11

shouldn't knock and announce, because, in different

12

cases, the consequences may be dramatic, they may be

13

severe, and damages may be severely assessed.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But, basically, your rule

15

is, the police are entitled to take the chance.

16

they -- if they get inside, and people have got their

17

clothes on and there's no gun battle, no problem;

18

nothing that the police are exposed to, either by an

19

exclusionary rule or by a civil recovery.

20

they want to take that chance, if they want to take

21

the chance that somebody will not be dressed or a gun

22

will be pulled, basically that's their option.

23

MR. BAUGHMAN:

If

And if

I think, as in other

24

situations where this Court does not apply the

25

exclusionary rule, simply on a deterrence basis --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

exclusionary rule, even when there would be

deterrence -- that that is correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's not

5

true.

at least possible, where evidence is going to be a --

causally connected to a violation of the knock-and-

9

is because these people were involved in a shootout

knocked and announced, and "It's the police," they

wouldn't have that statement that's incriminating.

Circuit, in several opinions, has also reached the

And we,

MR. MORAN:

19

First of all, as to the evidence that is

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

causally connected to the knock-and-announce

21

violation, there are two reasons why the remote

22

possibility of such evidence will never deter police

23

officers from violating the knock-and-announce

24

requirement.

25

I'm not aware of a single case in American history

The first is that it's very remote.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

where there has been identified such evidence that is

2

directly causally related only to the knock-and-

3

announce violation.

4

fundamental, is that even if there were such

5

evidence, by definition the possibility of finding

6

such evidence will not deter the police from

7

committing a knock-and-announce violation, because

8

they wouldn't have found that evidence had they

9

complied with the knock-and-announce requirement.

But the second reason, more

In

10

other words, the police would only gain that evidence

11

by committing the knock-and-announce violation, so

12

there would be nothing lost in going ahead and

13

risking an excited utterance that they wouldn't be

14

able to use, because, by definition, they wouldn't be

15

getting that excited utterance, anyway.

16

I think it's important, with the Solicitor

17

General's brief, to rebut the claim that Miller and

18

Sabbath had something to do with the fact that there

19

was no warrant in those cases.

20

decided all these knock-and-announce cases in the

6

7

this Court should have simply said the Petitioners or

relief they are seeking, because the knock-and-

14

There will be virtually no cases, there will be

15

virtually no more development of this rule.

16

17

been wrong in Sabbath, and it was wrong to reach the

18

substantive constitutional questions it reached in

20

other courts, the -- virtually every State currently

21

suppressing evidence seized after a knock-and-

23

And so, a lot of courts, including this Court, have

24

been wrong a lot of times, if my opponent is correct.

25

Finally, one last word on Segura.

2

inevitable-discovery -- in fact, a winning

3

inevitable-discovery or independent-source argument.

4

But the key thing in Segura is, this Court did not

5

disturb the fact that the evidence that was seized

6

during the initial entry was suppressed, because that

7

was directly connected to the unlawful entry.
