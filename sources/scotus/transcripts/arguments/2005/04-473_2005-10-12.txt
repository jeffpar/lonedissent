CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument now

Ms. Lee.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CINDY LEE

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8
9

MS. LEE:

Chief Justice Roberts, and may it

please the Court:

10

The issue presented is whether the first

11

amendment requires protection for all public employee

12

speech that touches on a matter of public concern without

13

any consideration of whether the speech was expressed as a

14

citizen.

15

The Ninth Circuit's approach affords no

16

consideration for the role of the speaker as a citizen or

17

an employee at the time of the speech.

18

however, plants a seed of a constitutional claim in

19

virtually every speech that public employees express while

20

carrying out their regular job duties.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22
23
24
25

This approach,

Well, that's -- I mean, I can

see JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Do you think that the Court

tried to apply the Pickering test?
MS. LEE:

The Ninth Circuit clearly did not

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

apply the Pickering test when they were doing the initial

2

analysis, a threshold analysis, of whether or not the

3

speech at issue was constitutionally protected.

4

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Do you think that the

5

Pickering test, properly applied, would have reached a

6

different result in this case?

7
8

MS. LEE:

Not necessarily, not the way the Ninth

--

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

10

MS. LEE:

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

12

MS. LEE:

It could have -

-- Circuit viewed it.
-- certainly.

Well, in the Ninth Circuit's view, the

13

capacity of an employee at the time of the speech is of

14

some factor.

15

view, it was a factor that should be weighed against

16

finding no constitutional protection.

17

It's a determinative factor.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But, in its

In its view -

Do you think that the proper

18

application of Pickering would yield a different result in

19

this case?

20

MS. LEE:

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

22

MS. LEE:

Our view is that Could it?

-- if the application of the Pickering

23

is rearticulated such that when job-required speech is at

24

issue, like in this case, the employer should invariably

25

win or have a -- an easier time of prevailing.

But, in

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

this case, the Ninth Circuit didn't see it that way.

2

Ninth Circuit took the view that the capacity of an

3

employee at the time of the speech is a factor, but it

4

would be difficult for an employer to justify employment

5

decisions made when the employee is speaking as required

6

by the duties of employment.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

Counsel, you've made the point

8

that if we go the Ninth Circuit way, every time an

9

employee gets in Dutch there's a potential first amendment

10

issue.

11

Ninth Circuit?

I think 1988 was the year of the Circuit's

12

Roth decision.

So, we haven't seen a deluge, and doesn't

13

that rather discount your argument?

14

Why hasn't that been a problem since 1988 in the

MS. LEE:

Well, our view is that if we accept

15

the Ninth Circuit's approach, then speech by public

16

employees expressed while carrying out their assigned job

17

duties would virtually -- invariably be -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

MS. LEE:

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

-- a matter I realize that, but that -- as

21

I understand it, that has been true since the Ninth

22

Circuit's Roth decision in 1988.

23

not seen a deluge of these claims, or we would have had

24

citations to the cases.

25

the concern that you express?

And apparently we have

So, doesn't that rather discount

1

MS. LEE:

Not necessarily.

The Ninth Circuit

2

and the other circuits that have made, primarily, content

3

the determinative factor in finding presumptive first-

4

amendment protection have, in some regards, considered the

5

capacity of an employee as whether or not the speech

6

should be protected under the first amendment, but they've

7

done so in the context of whether or not it is a matter of

8

public concern.

9

addressed squarely whether or not job-required speech

So, the Ninth Circuit is alone in having

10

should not be afforded presumptive first-amendment

11

protection.

12

The other JUSTICE SOUTER:

But didn't -- maybe I'm wrong

13

on my assumption, but didn't the Ninth Circuit take that

14

position, back in 1988?

15

MS. LEE:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's correct.
Okay.
What do you do with a

18

public university professor, who -- is fired for the

19

content of his lectures?

20

employment, that's what he's paid to do.

21

first-amendment protection?

22

MS. LEE:

Certainly, in the course of his
That has no

Well, it would be our view that if the

23

assigned job duties of that university professor was to

24

speak on a particular topic or content, and they were

25

getting paid for doing that, that that is a job-required

speech and that it should not be entitled, presumptively,

2

to first-amendment protection.

3

from -

4

Now, that is a far cry

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

"Should not be entitled,

5

presumptively, to first-amendment protection," what does

6

that mean?

7

protection, in light of the particular context -

That there might be first amendment

8

MS. LEE:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

MS. LEE:

Our -- of the speech?

Well, according to the Ninth Circuit's

11

view, anything -- anytime a public employee speaks, and

12

that speech relates to a matter of public concern, that is

13

presumptively entitled to first-amendment protection, such

14

that the burden is on the employer to justify the

15

decisions for the employment actions taken.

16

Our view is that the employer should not have

17

that burden until the first threshold is made, that the

18

speech is expressed as a citizen on a matter of public

19

concern.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose that, in the

21

situation the Chief Justice mentioned, the professor would

22

still be able to contend that the university fired him

23

because it disagreed with the political content of his

24

speech or because of the university's politics.

25

still make that claim, couldn't he?

He could

MS. LEE:

Our approach would not prohibit that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. LEE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

it would be in most cases -

-- kind of -

7

MS. LEE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. LEE:

10

But the -

-- burden would be on him, as

That's correct, Justice Scalia.
-- to show that that was true.

That's correct.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Whereas, the Ninth Circuit

11

would put it on the -- put the burden on the university to

12

show that it wasn't true.

13

MS. LEE:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's correct.

The ninth -

I would have thought you

15

might have argued that it's speech paid for by the

16

Government, that's what they pay him for, it's their

17

speech; and so, there's no first-amendment issue at all.

18

MS. LEE:

In essence, the principle of our

19

approach is supported by those Government subsidizer

20

cases, like the Rust v. Sullivan.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Our -

But in Rust v. Sullivan, the

22

Government was buying a commodity.

23

Government's program, and it was employing people, funding

24

people to implement that program.

1

If that's part of his job responsibilities, that's quite

2

different from speaking the speech that the Government

3

wants spoken.

4

MS. LEE:

Well, in this case, we think that the

5

job duties are aligned with those subsidizer cases.

6

have a deputy district attorney whose job duty was to

7

assess the merits of the prosecution's case, which he did.

8
9

We

That includes assessing the credibility of a witness.
Because his conclusions in this case were that the

10

prosecution's witness was not very credible does not make

11

that task extraordinary.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess if your job is to speak

13

truth, and you speak falsehood, that's a good reason to

14

fire you, which is what happened here.

credibility of the officer.

I don't think we're going to win on this case."

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but the disposition by

that there was no retaliation.

18

was proper and there was no inefficiency or misconduct on

19

the part of the speaker.

20

MS. LEE:

He assumed that the speech

resulted in the finding that the supervisors did not

retaliate against the deputy district attorney for the --

23

for his job-required duties.

So, we assume, for purposes of

not, itself, provide the basis for saying he was

9

incompetent or something of that -- like that.

10

MS. LEE:

MS. LEE:

performance at issue that's required by the public

employee, it essentially puts the question before a jury

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Lee, is your position

15

that job-required speech -- an assistant district

attorney's obligation is to give his best opinion -- that

job-required speech is outside the first-amendment

protection?

one way.

You say the Ninth Circuit went too far, in

But are you saying that as long as it's related

doesn't come in the door, because he's not speaking as a

current understanding of the Pickering balancing -- which

14

is -- shifts the burden to the employer to justify the

employment decisions made -- that we don't -- I don't

necessarily believe that the Pickering would clearly weigh

17

in favor of the employer in this case, even though the

speech was so connected to the duties of employment -

Because, a moment ago, I thought you answered me,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MS. LEE:

-- "first amendment."

Our -- the -- our view is that job-

12

required speech should not be protected under the first

14

there is no need to go into the weighing of the interests

of the employer versus the interest of the employee.

16

balancing has been required in the -- in the line of cases

17

that the Court has held -- the language that the Court has

18

used in this first-amendment public-employment context is,

Thank you -

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

What's your answer to that

last question, Mr. Himmelfarb?
MR. HIMMELFARB:

A Brady obligation is an

18

obligation of a prosecutor in his capacity as a

19

prosecutor; and a Brady disclosure, like a recommendation

20

to a superior that there should be a Brady disclosure,

21

constitutes the exercise of the prosecutorial function by

22

a prosecutor.

23

it engenders an employment action, should not be

24

sufficient for the employee to get past the first step of

25

the Pickering balancing.

It is employee speech, and that speech, if

So, no free-speech protection

MR. HIMMELFARB:

That's exactly right, Justice

O'Connor.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And how about this case?

6

Could it not be resolved under a proper handling of

7

Pickering?

8
9

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, we think a proper

handling of Pickering is that respondents should not get

10

past step one of the balancing, because the speech is

11

expressed in his capacity as an employee.

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Now, what about retaliation

13

claims that the employee may have?

14

whistleblower-type claims by an employer?

15

they separate from the first-amendment concerns?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if the reason -- what if

3

the reason for the -- for firing him is that he's a

Democrat and it's a Republican Administration, and the

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Justice Scalia, I think that

7

case would be covered by this Court's patronage cases,

8

which would absolutely prohibit that sort of employment

9

action.

But in a case where it's not party affiliation

10

that motivates the employment action, if the speech is

11

expressed in carrying out the employee's duties, he may

12

have a civil-service remedy -- indeed, that's precisely

13

what the civil-service laws were designed to deal with, a

14

situation where the employee is just doing his job, an

15

action is taken again him, and there's a dispute as to

16

whether he was doing his job properly, about whether he

17

was insubordinate, or simply about whether he was -

professional judgment, a Brady disclosure should be made,

15

and if the supervisor disagreed with him, and if

16

reasonable minds could differ as to whether the disclosure

17

should be made, and he made it, nonetheless, he would be

insubordinate.

Can't we

If it's -- if it's a situation

where reasonable minds cannot differ, and the superior

directs him not to make the disclosure, in clear

contravention of the due-process clause as interpreted in

Brady, that is a situation -

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

11
12

But, Mr. Himmelfarb, in that

case he could also be fired if he made the statement in a
speech, could he not?
MR. HIMMELFARB:

If he made the statement in a

public speech -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Right.
-- or in a letter to the editor

15

of a newspaper, we think that speech would be

16

presumptively protected by the first amendment.

17
18
19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But could he not be fired if

the scenario you just described as MR. HIMMELFARB:

Maybe he could, Justice

20

Stevens, but that would be subject to balancing, and it

21

would be the employer's duty to justify the firing, based

22

on workplace disruption.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me odd that the

24

employee has greater protection if he goes outside the

25

regular channels and makes a speech than if he does -- he

25
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

2

what's wrong and should be remedied."

3

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, it's not that odd,

4

Justice Stevens, because if you have an obligation to

5

report misconduct -- take, again, the example of the

constituted the discharge of the employee's assigned work

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Ever since Pickering, it has been the law that

16

the first amendment protects public employees from being

fired or punished for expressing views on matters of

18

public importance where, as here, there is no harm or

disruption to their employers.

Do you -- do you concede -- and maybe you don't -- that

there is any category of first amendment speech, as a

matter of public concern, which an employee cannot direct

to the employer?

6

to which the employer can protect its own interests and

7

stifle the employee's speech?

If the supervisor told Mr.

Ceballos that there was something wrong in the manner in

which he conveyed his speech, and told him to revise the

within his rights to do so.

And

Second, the Court would proceed to a

10

of the -- you know, the tone or the message or because it

was a disagreement, and the supervisor's views ultimately

prevail.

the constant dialogue that is the everyday routine

practice in every governmental agency, local and Federal,

in the United States.

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

With respect, no.

These

20

cases are not that hard to dispose of at summary judgment.

21

Most actions that employers take against the employees

22

are not because of the employees' speech anyway, it's

23

because of how they carry out their job functions.

the policy is not to engage in abortion counseling.

And

10

he wrote a memo to the supervisor saying, "This is a

11

terribly policy.

12

counsel my patients and for me to do my job correctly."

13

That memo would not be the Government's message.

14

Ceballos's memo here to his supervisor was also not the

15

Government's message.

This is inhibiting our ability to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Well, why is that?

In

18

the -- in your hypothetical, the doctor is -- it's not his

19

job to challenge the restriction on the Government grant,

20

but that's what he's doing, so that's not part of his job.

21

Here, it's part of Ceballos's job to explain why the case

22

should be dismissed, and that's what he wrote in his memo.

23

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

But this is a very malleable

24

and manipulable concept, what's part of a job.

that he feels is inhibiting his ability to counsel his

patients is as much part of his job as a prosecutor going

to his supervisor and saying, "There's government

misconduct in this case, and we need to do something about

5

it."

discriminatory practices in the school would be part of a

Just like a teacher in the Givhan case, going to her

her students.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you do with your

12

friend's response to that, that in Connick the Court

13

characterized Givhan as involving a case of a citizen

14

complaining about a particular practice?

15

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:

Well, I think that

16

underscores the point, that the employee in Givhan was

17

speaking both as an employee and as a citizen, and these

18

roles are not mutually exclusive.

19

There's no artificial distinction that the Court has drawn

here.

just that, speaking in both capacities.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your answer to Justice Breyer's

Justice Breyer's question is, look at -- if you want to be

21

sure that, in every case, you know, the good cases fall on

22

this side, the bad cases fall on -- he should buy your

position that every case should go to a balancing test.

application.

rhetorical question.
But, to get back to Justice Breyer's question,

13

there's also -- I think this came up in -- when my

14

opposing counsel was talking, that there's this extra element

15

present here, which is that there is an independent

16

constitutional problem here, in that when you have a --

17

police misconduct, you have someone whose right to fair

18

trial are at stake, and you have a prosecutor who's trying

19

to fulfill his individual ethical and constitutional

obligation -

there's an independent constitutional basis for the speech
