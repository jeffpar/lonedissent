ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

This case involves the somewhat murky concept

11

of an association-in-fact enterprise within the meaning

12

of section 1961(4) of title 18, which is the RICO

13

statute, and actually the specific language in this

14

case, which is reproduced in the Petitioner's brief at

15

page 2, is a group of individuals associated in fact.

16

In this case, there are two fairly obvious

17

enterprises that one might have expected a plaintiff to

18

identify in this -- in its -- in their complaint.

19

first one is Mohawk Industries, which is their

20

employer.

21

serve as an enterprise.

22

if you identify Mohawk as the -- as the enterprise, you

23

then cannot sue Mohawk as the person under this Court's

24

decision in Kushner.

25

enterprise under -- on that -- because of that reason.

The

That is a corporation, clearly eligible to
But, of course, the problem is

And so Mohawk was an unattractive

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Second, there are the recruiting and

2

temporary agencies which are likely corporations and

3

certainly are legal entities and, again, are eligible

4

to be enterprises within the meaning of the statute.

5

But, again, here the problem is that there is no

6

indication that Mohawk in any way directs or conducts

7

the affairs of those agencies, and therefore, under

8

this Court's explicit holding in Reves, there would no

9

-- there would be no basis for liability.

10

And so the plaintiffs have attempted to sort

11

of move around those two substantial obstacles to

12

stating a claim by laying the claim to what is called

13

an association-in-fact enterprise.

14

paragraph 76, which is on page 23 of the joint

15

appendix, states this fairly broadly.

16

participated in an association-in-fact enterprise with

17

third party employment agencies and other recruiters.

18

The question is what is this enterprise and

Their complaint at

Mohawk has

19

does it have legs for purposes of bringing a RICO

20

action.

21

there are two subissues within that.

22

In analyzing that question, it seems to me

The first one is whether or not the language

23

of section 1961(4) precludes using the corporation as

24

part of an association-in-fact enterprise because

25

1961(4) explicitly -- or specifically refers to

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

individuals, and everyone has recognized, including I

2

think the Respondents and the United States, that if --

3

if it were clear that association-in-fact enterprises

4

or that enterprises limited to individuals under these

5

circumstances, given the structure of the statute, the

6

corporation would not be permissibly brought in on this

7

particular theory.

8

not that is a limiting principle under this definition.

9

So you have to get past whether or

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If we were -Before you get to your

11

second point, why is that first point before us?

12

-- you didn't raise it in the courts below.

13

raise it in your petition here.

14

presented it -- I'd like to stretch to reach it, but I

15

don't even find it necessarily included within the

16

question presented.

17

a defendant corporation and its agents engaged in

18

ordinary, arms-length dealings can constitute an

19

enterprise in light of the settled rule that a RICO

20

defendant must conduct or participate in the affairs of

21

some distinct enterprise and not just its own affairs.

22

It seems to me it's only question two you put before

23
24
25

You

You didn't

The question presented is whether

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Scalia, the -- the

answer -- a couple answers.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

First of all, obviously, we could not have

2

raised this before the -- either the district court or

3

the court of appeals because the law was absolutely

4

settled in the Eleventh Circuit.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
circuits.

MR. PHILLIPS:

As it is in nine other

circuits.

10

As it is in nine other

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And all circuits against

you.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To be sure.
And we would have been

13

unlikely to accept cert on -- on point one alone I

14

think.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

But the second -- but the question is not --

Right.

17

the question is whether or not that issue is fairly

18

subsumed within the question that was actually

19

presented, and that --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think it's -- it's a

21

little more difficult in your case because you're

22

pursuing an interlocutory appeal, which you were

23

allowed to do only because you've got double

24

certification and you got certification on the

25

questions that the district court addressed.

You can't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

expand a 1292(b) order to include things that were not

2

decided below.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

The -- the question presented

4

in this case -- and it's the same question that was

5

presented below -- is whether the defendant corporation

6

and its agents under these circumstances can constitute

7

an enterprise.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In light of the settled rule

that a defendant must conduct or participate in the

10

affairs of some distinct enterprise and not just its

11

own affairs.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To be sure.

But the --

If you hadn't included that

14

last part, in light of, but it seems to me you're

15

focusing on the -- on the particular claim that you're

16

making.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

But, Justice Scalia, the in

18

light of certainly raises the secondary issue, but it's

19

still -- I mean, the rule is whether it's fairly

20

subsumed within the question.

21

prior question whether or not the statute extends to

22

this particular situation.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it is a logically

It is logically prior, and I

24

hate to go through all the trouble of figuring out this

25

case if, indeed, corporations are ineligible anyway.

I

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

mean, you know, we're -- we're answering a totally

2

hypothetical, nonexistent question.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

But the situation that's

4

presented here is identical to the situation that

5

existed in McNally v. United States, Justice Scalia.

6

In that case, the question was whether or not an

7

intangible rights theory of mail fraud could be

8

extended to include nongovernment officials.

9

the specific question presented in that case, and

That was

10

that's the -- the question the Court granted.

11

every court of appeals had interpreted that statute to

12

say that intangible rights theories are valid under

13

that statute.

14

to in the petition, and it was briefed in this Court --

And -- and that issue was not adverted

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

And

And they weren't --

-- and it was regarded as

fairly subsumed just as --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- they weren't --

I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.
-- they weren't -- your

21

problem is you don't have a final judgment.

22

way that you can get even to the court of appeals is on

23

that 1292(b) order.

24

1292(b) was to say specify the questions that are so

25

important that they have to be decided and appealed

The only

2

might have -- whatever one might read into a question

3

presented, I don't think that 1292(b) orders have ever

4

been treated that way.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

And whatever there

I -- I don't have any specific

6

authority to the contrary, although the other side

7

didn't argue 1292(b) as in some sense a limitation

here.

question presented.

13

to analyze what is --

But your opponents have cited in your brief

-- in the brief on page 12 that counsel for Mohawk said

to the court, specifically, Mohawk agrees that a

particular concession?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

The -- the clause that

3

introduces that is under current law, and that's

4

absolutely true in the Eleventh Circuit.

law, as it existed in the Eleventh Circuit when we

6

wrote that, there was no question that a corporation

7

can be included within an association-in-fact

8

enterprise.

what the state of the law was in the Eleventh Circuit

Under current

Therefore, all we were doing was conceding

10

and not questioning that, as -- as, candidly, we had no

11

ability to do that.

12

futile gesture to have raised this issue at any point

13

prior to.

14

It would have been an utterly

We could have raised it in the petition for

15

certiorari, to be sure.

16

subsumed within the question presented, and we also

17

think it would be an -- an utterly artificial exercise

18

to try to analyze what is an association-in-fact

19

enterprise without first deciding whether or not a

20

corporation could be included in the first instance

21

because, as Justice Scalia says, if they can't, then it

22

seems to me this is a substantially easier question,

23

and also it is an extraordinarily important one.

24
25

We -- we think it is fairly

It is true that the courts of appeals have
lined up consistently on the other side of this issue,

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

but it is equally true that none of them has analyzed

2

this issue with anything near the kind of care that

3

would at least give me comfort that they've finally and

4

fully resolved the issue.

5

more thorough vetting of it at this point because the

6

circuits are -- are at this -- at this stage

7

essentially lined up.

8

opportunity for the Court is here.

And we're not going to get a

So the right time and

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, unless somebody

10

raises it.

11

it for the rehearing en banc or -- or some other way.

12

Unless somebody raises it below to preserve

MR. PHILLIPS:

But all of those courts are

13

going to say the same thing, which is that this issue

14

has been resolved.

15

might get an en banc review on it, but again, you don't

16

have the question -- you don't have a split anywhere

17

other than some district court decisions that have --

18

that have recognized our interpretation.

19
20
21

It's possible, presumably, you

The issue is squarely posed here at this
point.

It's been fully briefed for this Court.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what -- what sense

22

would it make on the merits to get your interpretation

23

on the merits, which would mean, I guess, that five

24

individuals could be an enterprise because that's a

25

group of individuals.

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

Yes, that's true.
Five labor unions couldn't.

Five corporations couldn't.

One individual and four

4

labor unions couldn't.

One individual and four

5

corporations couldn't.

One individual and three

6

partnerships couldn't.

And -- but what -- what sense

7

would that make?

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because all of those various

combinations can still be attacked under the theory of

10

RICO by just simply structuring your -- your enterprise

11

in the proper way.

12

You can't expand the enterprise definition in order to

13

include a variety of different elements, but there's no

14

way -- I mean, in this case, for instance, they could

15

have named Mohawk as the enterprise.

16

named the -- the recruiting agencies as the enterprise.

It is true you can't broaden it.

They could have

17

They could have named the corporate officers as the

18

enterprise, and they could have dealt with all of them

19

as a conspiracy.

20

precisely the issues that you identify, Justice Breyer.

And all of those are ways to get at

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

If -- if --

And the answer --- if Mohawk were a

partnership instead of a corporation -MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

association of individuals.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- the partnership is an

Well, a partnership is

4

identified specifically under the statute as a -- as a

5

-- as an enterprise -- as eligible for an enterprise.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if the answer is yes,

7

if Mohawk had been a partnership, you would not have

8

this particular objection.

9
10

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

That wouldn't

be this particular --

11
12

That's correct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it's only the corporate

form.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, no.

If we were a

14

partnership, it couldn't be in an enterprise with --

15

with an association of individuals.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

The question is --

That's --

-- does -- can you have an

18

associational enterprise that extends beyond

19

individuals, that gets -- that goes beyond the gangs

20

and their family.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that's why I'm

22

asking you about the partnership because it is an

23

association of individuals.

24

your answer is.

25

like a corporation.

So I'm not clear on what

No partnership could be treated just
They're not an individual?

Or

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

partnerships are okay because there's not a separate

2

entity.

3

It's a -- it's a association of individuals.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, let me be clear on this,

4

that if -- if you just bring an action against the

5

partnership qua partnership you could clearly do that

6

because that's defined as a -- as a legal entity --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

No.

Would the --

-- for purposes -- if you're

trying to take the partnership and tag it to another

10

group of rag-tag individuals, that would not be an

11

enterprise in fact because that's not an -- an

12

association of individuals.

13

has an entity apart from the individuals.

14

It's a partnership which

Now, if you disaggregated all of the

15

individuals within the partnership and called them

16

individuals and said that they group with another group

17

of individuals, then, yes.

18

demonstrate that there is the loose organization,

19

common purpose, and all of the requirements for having

20

an association-in-fact available, sure, that wouldn't

21

be any problem.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think if you could

If this provision is

23

exclusive, as you claim it is -- it's intended to be an

24

exclusive definition, why -- why would they include

25

union, just union and individuals?

1

a union that --

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

Because --- that is not equally magic

about a partnership or a corporation?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

Well, because what they

6

have -- you have to go back to the original list.

7

list starts off with individuals, corporations,

8

partnerships, associations, and other legal entities,

9

unions, which is in addition to that because it's not a

10

legal entity, or at least there was case law at the

11

time --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

entity.

15
16

And then other associations.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

This is just a union.

Or any legal entity.

Right.
A union that is not --

It's just an additional item

in the list.

23

25

This refers to a union that

is not -- is not an association.
MR. PHILLIPS:

24

Oh, I see.

-- that it's not a legal

JUSTICE ALITO:

But why would they use

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

includes in that provision and means in other

2

provisions?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because I think they viewed

4

those as absolutely synonymous, Justice Alito, and --

5

and the reason I think that is because we know that in

6

some instances they use including but not limited to,

7

which reflects that Congress recognized that includes

8

in some contexts is an exhaustive listing, and I think

9

they thought in some contexts, meaning 1961(4), that it

10

was an exhaustive listing.

11

And also, it's important to look at the other

12

definitions of 1961(4), and I think this is the most

13

important element of the other side's submission in

14

this case because they do no business with any of the

15

other definitions.

16

definition of property for forfeiture purposes, those

17

are unquestionably exhaustive lists.

18

the way I -- we argued it.

19

that.

20

includes.

21

The Attorney General, the

At least, that's

They didn't respond to

And yet, those are introduced with the term

So it strikes me that the best contextual

22

evidence of what Congress intended here was that

23

includes would be used exhaustively and that the use of

24

individuals of associated in fact would be used as a

25

limiting principle, not as part of an exhaustive

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

principle that expands the scope of this beyond --

2

beyond -- into a realm where it becomes nothing but a

3

mere conspiracy statute, which is what it is today

4

under this -- under this particular theory.

5

That's -- unless there are further questions

6

about the straight statutory interpretation question,

7

then I would go to the second issue, which is assuming

8

that corporations can, nevertheless, be involved in

9

association-in-fact enterprises, does this state such a

10

thing.

11

And here, you have to go back to the Court's

12

opinion in Reves, and in Reves, what the Court held is

13

that liability depends on showing that the defendants

14

conducted or participated in the conduct of the

15

enterprise's affairs, not just their own affairs.

16

Okay?

17

have to distinguish the -- the corporate defendant's

18

affairs in that case and -- and the affairs of the --

19

of the enterprise in this case.

20

So it is an element of RICO liability that you

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And don't they do that by --

21

don't the allegations do that here by claiming that the

22

corporation was manufacturing or providing false Social

23

Security cards and was giving aid to the immigrants if

24

the -- the law got too close to them?

25

not merely the conduct by a corporation of the normal

I mean, that is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

business of hiring and employing people.

2

the sort of extra that is alleged that takes this out

3

simply of the -- of the category of the -- of the

4

corporation conducting its own affairs?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Isn't that

Justice Souter, that is the

6

only allegation that comes remotely close to suggesting

7

anything along those lines, but I -- my submission to

8

you is that it doesn't get you there because what it

9

says is that the recruiters are sometimes assisted --

10

it does say the recruiters -- by Mohawk employees who

11

carry Social Security cards which they use for

12

prospective or existing employees' needs to assume a

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's when they come to Mohawk as

That's the allegation.

That's

That's not

Well, maybe I misunderstood

19

the thrust of the allegation.

20

the allegation was that Mohawk was acting illegally in

21

providing phony Social Security cards.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

I thought the thrust of

Well, I don't doubt that

23

there's a claim that -- that there's illegality.

24

of this is permeated with claims of illegality.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All

Doesn't -- doesn't that get

1

them at least to -- through the motion to dismiss, and

2

doesn't it at least get them to summary judgment?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't think so because even

4

in Reves, the -- Ernst & Young had been found to have

5

engaged in illegality, that there was -- that there was

6

securities fraud involved there.

7

doesn't distinguish it.

8

make it a conspiracy, but it doesn't demonstrate either

9

what the -- what the association-in-fact enterprise is

So that's -- that

The fact of illegality would

10

and what are its affairs that are distinguished from

11

the affairs of the corporation.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But in -- in Reves -- and if

13

-- and -- and you -- you may well correct me on this

14

because I'm -- I'm -- my memory is not precise.

15

thought in Reves, in effect, what they did was to lie

16

in the course of doing the sort of the thing that they

17

normally do.

18

doing something, providing phony ID's, that employers

19

don't normally do.

20

that's a fine line, but is -- is it not a fine enough

21

line to get it out of Reves and get it beyond the

22

motion to dismiss?

23

But I

Here, the allegation is that they were

Isn't -- and, you know, maybe

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't think so, Justice

24

Souter, because -- because the -- it's a question I

25

think of abstraction.

What we normally do is hire

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

employees and review their applications.

2

process, we've been alleged to engage in illegal acts

3

by providing them with false identifications.

4

don't see how that's any different from the Reves

5

situation where the claim is that you're providing

6

ordinary auditing advice, but in the process you're

7

lying.

8

to me it is precisely the same problem in both

9

situations.

10

Now, in that

You're engaged in illegal activities.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I

It seems

Well, there is -- there is a

11

common element of illegality, but the distinction is

12

that in Reves, you're supposed to be providing these

13

services, making out statements, et cetera, and you put

14

the wrong numbers in them.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Intentionally.
Whereas in -- in this case,

17

an employer does not normally go about providing phony

18

ID's or any ID's for the people it hires.

19

are you?

20

and there's -- there's an affirmative act here.

21

It says, who

What's your Social Security number?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

And --

Justice Souter, I

22

don't doubt that, but the question is what is the legal

23

standard in Reves.

24

engage in illegality, and Reves doesn't say, can we

25

make out a claim of conspiracy.

And Reves doesn't say, did you

Reves says what you

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

have to demonstrate is that you are conducting or

2

directing the operations or affairs of some entity,

3

apart from yourself.

4

giving ID cards to our either actual or potential

5

employees.

6

And here, all we're doing is

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In -- in -- yes, but you're

7

doing it in connection with a -- a joint recruitment

8

activity.

9

hire to get the workers up to the door are not going to

10

succeed very well if -- if all the workers are going to

11

arrive without any papers and without any -- any

12

indication like a Social Security card and so on that

13

they can be part of -- of the legal work force.

14

there's -- there's something extra being done both by

15

the -- the recruiters and by you, and the extra, in

16

effect, is a -- a scheme to provide phony ID's that

17

suggest that these people are -- are lawful rather than

18

-- than unlawful immigrants.

19

In other words, the -- the agencies that you

MR. PHILLIPS:

So

But that still doesn't seem to

20

me, Justice Souter, to satisfy the Reves standard,

21

which is not just that there has to be something more

22

than conducting your own affairs immediately, although

23

that's important, and I don't think that -- I don't

24

think you can show that -- either that we went beyond

25

conducting our affairs or that the recruiters went

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

beyond conducting their affairs.

2

allegations break out that way.

3

All of these

But what Reves says you have to do is

4

demonstrate that you conducted or directed the affairs

5

of whatever this association-in-fact entity is.

So -- so that if you

10

And that's the part that's

I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that if you

11

charged the workers, you know, $10 for their fake ID

12

cards, you think that would be a different case.

13
14

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I don't think either of

those --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Because there, that's

16

-- there, you -- you -- there's a separate enterprise

17

basically selling ID cards, and that's not part of

18

Mohawk's business.

19

way you hire other employees, illegally as it's

20

alleged, that's Mohawk's enterprise if there's some

21

separate illegal activity?

22

But if you're just hiring them the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, see, under those

23

circumstances, I wouldn't have any problem calling

24

Mohawk the enterprise.

25

of this.

I mean, that's the whole point

The -- the logical enterprise here is the

22

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

corporation.

2

create these completely artificial entities.

3

you know, this -- this associational enterprise doesn't

4

exist except in the minds of the plaintiffs.

5

The question is do you go beyond that to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean,

Mr. Phillips, I -- I tend to

6

agree with that, but I -- I just hate to get the lower

7

courts into this business of determining when a

8

corporation is going beyond its business.

9

discussion with Justice Souter I think indicates how --

Your -- your

10

how hard that is, or some of the examples that the

11

Government brings up, such as a drug company that --

12

that sells drugs illegally, violating the drug laws.

13

Is that part of its business or not part of its

14

business?

15

into that.

16

I -- I really don't -- don't want to buy

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think it's a little

17

late in the day, Justice Scalia, because that is

18

precisely the standard the Court articulated in Reves.

19

It said the question is not do you -- are you -- are

20

you conducting the affairs of your own operation,

21

however that's defined.

22

need to -- you need to define.

23

But I'm not sure whether you

I mean, you know, in some ways, this also

24

goes to why it -- it's a mistake to get into this in

25

the first place because if you just said it has to be

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

individuals associated in fact, you don't have to get

2

into any of this inquiry.

3

to evaluate all of these problems in one fell swoop.

4

You could obviate the need

But even assuming that you still want to live

5

in this world, you still -- it seems to me you've got

6

to identify what it is -- what -- what is the nature,

7

what is the loose organization of this separate

8

enterprise, and then what are its functions.

9

you have to evaluate how it is that the defendant is,

And then

10

in fact, operating or conducting or directing the

11

affairs of that enterprise.

12

And that's what's missing, Justice Souter, in

13

-- in footnote -- or excuse me -- in paragraph 76

14

because while it goes to -- you know, it says we paid

15

for illegal aliens to be employed.

16

that's clearly hiring.

17

Okay, well, that --

That's the first one.

The second one is they have temp agencies and

18

they pool their employees and they loan them to us for

19

a fee.

20

That's what they do.

21

they'll have them available in their pool.

22

-- we don't direct any of that.

23

we are -- it's an arms-length deal.

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

Well, that's the business of temp agencies.
They transport employees to -- so
That's not

We -- we are their --

Okay, but I still think

sooner or later we have to come back to something that

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you and I went over a moment ago, and that is the --

2

one function, maybe the function, of -- of the -- of

3

the -- the entity claimed here is -- is providing cover

4

for the illegal status of the aliens.

5

me that there is at least a bare claim here that Mohawk

6

is directing the affairs or the business of -- of this

7

third entity --

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10
11

And it seems to

Well, the -- the --- by -- by the way that it

is -- allegedly provides phony Social Security cards.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, according to the

12

allegation in paragraph 77, it just says obtaining

13

illegal workers.

14

providing them with cover, that the common purpose of

15

this enterprise --

16

It doesn't say anything about

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Where -- where do we --

17

you're going to have to help me out then.

18

where in the -- the pleadings or the -- the papers do

19

we get into the Social -- do we get the allegations of

20

the Social Security card?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24
25

allegation.

Where --

That's paragraph 76.
Okay.

And that's a factual

But -- but it -- but all I'm saying is --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't that factual

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

allegation, as a bare matter, sufficient to satisfy the

2

objection that you raise, that something more than

3

merely the activity -- the conduct of -- of their

4

separate business is going on?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, because what you still

6

need -- there's still a higher -- it's not just the

7

higher threshold that it's got to be something that

8

moves beyond what the corporation does.

9

involve the direction or the conduct of the operation

10
11

It has to

of a separate entity.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if -- if, in fact, it

12

is the case that Mohawk is -- is providing the Social

13

Security cards, isn't it directing the means by which

14

the third -- the third entity is, in effect, illegally

15

-- or supplying illegal workers in -- in this -- this

16

joint enterprise?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, obviously, we're going

18

to disagree about this I think, but at the end of the

19

day, I think the bottom line is what we're doing is

20

when the applicant shows up at our doorstep or when

21

they have, in fact, been hired, if for -- and this is

22

the allegation.

23

this is the allegation.

24

those employees -- our employees and our applicants

25

with these false ID's.

Obviously, none of this is true.

But

That we then -- we then supply

That's part of the process of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

our own hiring.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is it reasonable -- is it

3

reasonable to suppose, on the basis reading the

4

allegations as they have to be read at this stage of

5

the proceeding -- is it reasonable to infer that --

6

from the allegation that there is an understanding

7

between Mohawk and the employment agencies that Mohawk

8

will provide this documentation and therefore make the

9

scheme work?

10
11
12
13
14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it -- the allegation

certainly doesn't say that.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

It doesn't say that in any

-- any black letter statement.
MR. PHILLIPS:

There is only one sentence in

15

the allegation that even remotely says anything about

16

this. And again, Justice Souter, the -- the fundamental

17

assumption here is that if there's something that goes

18

anywhere beyond our affairs, that that by itself is

19

sufficient to take you out of Reves.

20

argue strenuously is that what Reves says is you have

21

to be conducting or directing the operations of the

Thank you, Mr.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FOSTER:

Yes.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
As Mr. Phillips makes quite clear, Mohawk

12

does not like the way the plaintiffs have written their

13

complaint in this case.

14

prefer that the enterprise be Mohawk Industries and

15

certain individuals within the corporation be named

as the RICO persons.

18

complaint, and at this stage, as far as the case has

19

proceeded, which is only up to a motion to dismiss,

20

that's what we are to deal with, whether this states a

21

cause of action under RICO.

22

He would prefer -- they would

But the plaintiffs write their

There seems to be no dispute in the lower

23

courts that corporations can form associations of fact

24

with other entities and that a corporation can be a

25

person conducting the affairs of such an entity.

We

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

have alleged that here.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There may be no

3

dispute about it, but it does seem kind of strange to

4

encompass them under the term individuals when the same

5

statute uses individuals and corporations separately.

6

MR. FOSTER:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

But

7

actually the term -- the definition of enterprise in

8

RICO starts with the word includes and it also states

9

any union or group of individuals associated in fact,

10

though not a legal entity.

11

The word union is not defined.

12

Mohawk, union should be interpreted to mean a labor

13

union, but that makes no sense structurally because the

14

first part of that definition includes legal entities,

15

and if reference were being made by Congress to a labor

16

union, then the union would have been inserted in that

17

part of it because at the time RICO was written in

18

1970, Congress had already enacted the Labor Management

19

Relations Act of 1946, which made labor unions suable

20

entities.

21

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

According to

Well, do you agree that

that's an exhaustive list in subsection (4)?
MR. FOSTER:

I don't think it's an exhaustive

list, Justice Alito.

said in both H.J. v. Northwestern, Russello, and

3

Turkette.

4

This would appear to be that, as the Court

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, would you agree that

5

includes is meant to be exhaustive in many of the other

6

-- in a number of the other subsections of this

7

definitional provision?

8
9

MR. FOSTER:

I -- I don't think so.

I

believe that the way includes is actually used, for

10

example, in the definition of Attorney General, opens a

11

long definition which is itself exhaustive, but leaves

12

room for change.

13

that allowed any official to be designated by the

14

Attorney General to fall within that description.

15

There's room for designations and there's room for

16

change in the Justice Department as it occurs over

17

time.

18

Attorney General was written in a way

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't see how your point

19

regarding union helps you any because if -- if you --

20

if you win the point that union doesn't mean a labor

21

union, you still have, as -- as the end of this

22

definition, any union or group of individuals.

23

MR. FOSTER:

Yes.
A union of individuals or a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. FOSTER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

I would -- Justice Scalia, I

don't believe that union means labor union because --

9

11

MR. FOSTER:
there --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18
19

I'll give you that.

Then --

then it means a union or group of individuals.
MR. FOSTER:

17

Okay.

-- if it meant a labor union

14

16

Either union means labor

union or it means a union or group of individuals.

7
8

I think union is

A union or group of individuals.
Right.

So, you know, you're

just as bad off.
MR. FOSTER:

Well, the word individual is not

defined in the statute either, and -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's not

20

defined in the statute, but the prior list in the same

21

sentence says individual, partnership, corporation.

22

you'd assume whatever an individual is it's different

23

than a corporation or they wouldn't have had to say

24

corporation again.

MR. FOSTER:

So

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

Chief Justice, is actually not a single corporation.

That first list would not encompass a group of

It's because we have a joint

there's a pattern of racketeering activity.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's a pattern

20

MR. FOSTER:

They hired more than one.

Beyond that, there is the -- of course, the

Yes, but Reves demonstrates

that -- that your statement earlier that since it was

MR. FOSTER:

has suggested, that Mr. Phillips has suggested, saying,

for example, their test that Mohawk cannot be

involves hiring because it itself involves hiring would

dramatically change the interpretation of RICO.

the enterprise does.

in Turkette that a common purpose is required for there

to be a RICO enterprise.

22

That just can't be what Congress had in

In conclusion, I do not believe that the

it was startling to return to that issue, that Mr.

If

venture with outside recruiters in order to perpetrate

21

hundreds, if not thousands of violations of Federal

22

immigration law.

23

racketeering activity alleged in the complaint is

24

encompassed by the text of 18 U.S.C. 1962(c) and it

25

directly implicates section 1962(c)'s core purpose.

That sort of concerted, ongoing

1

The judgment of the court of appeals should be

2

affirmed.

3

Now, with respect to the textual question,

4

our argument is not that the collaborative venture

5

alleged in this complaint falls within the terms of

6

section 1961(4).

7

the usual background understanding of the term

8

enterprise and that it's not excluded from the statute

9

by operation of 1961(4).

10

Our argument is that it falls within

To take the first point first, if Congress

11

had not defined the term enterprise at all, but had

12

used the term enterprise in section 1962(c), this --

13

the courts construing the provision would have had to

14

determine whether the term enterprise was naturally

15

encompassed -- was naturally construed to encompass not

16

simply discrete legal entities but collaborations between

17

discrete actors.

18

the term would have been construed to include such

19

ventures.

20

And I think it's pretty clear that

That is, the -- RICO was enacted against the

21

backdrop of the Travel Act which prevented the use of

22

business enterprises to perpetrate particular crimes

23

and it was well established that a business enterprise

24

meant not simply a corporation or similar discrete

legal entity --

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why shouldn't includes here

2

be read to mean means when that seems to be the way

3

it's used in other subsections of this provision and

4

when the only thing that seems to be -- if this is not

5

an exhaustive list, the only thing that seems possibly

6

to be omitted from the list is what's involved here,

7

which is a group consisting of a corporation or other

8

legal -- other legal entity and -- and natural persons.

9
10
11

MR. STEWART:

I think there are several

reasons.
First, this Court's decisions make clear that

12

while includes may be construed as exclusive, if it

13

appears alone, when Congress employs the means/includes

14

structures -- structure and introduces some definitions

15

with the word means and others with the word includes,

16

that choice of verb should be taken as advertent, and

17

the Court shouldn't likely conclude that Congress

18

simply used the terms as interchangeable.

19

Second --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do -- do any of those cases

21

that you allude to that have means in some sections,

22

includes in others -- do any of them have in third

23

sections, includes, comma, without limitation, comma?

24

MR. STEWART:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but the -- the includes -Well, I think that's a big

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

difference.
MR. STEWART:

I think it would be a big

3

difference if the phrase, including but not limited to,

4

appeared in another provision of 1961, but that's not

5

where the phrase appears.

6

believe it's, 1964(c) which deals with the -- the civil

7

remedies provision, and where --

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. STEWART:

The phrase appears in, I

Close enough.

-- where the word includes

10

stood alone within that section, it was natural for

11

Congress to use what we call a -- a belt and suspenders

12

approach, making it clear that the word includes

13

shouldn't be taken as exclusive.

14

The second point I'd make is that the last of

15

-- I believe it's the last provision of 1961(4) is the

16

definition of pattern of racketeering activity.

17

that definition is introduced by the word requires.

18

The term pattern of racketeering activity requires at

19

least two racketeering acts committed not more than 10

20

years apart. And this Court in Sedima and then in H.J.,

21

Incorporated has attached significance to that choice

22

of verbs and has explained that Congress' use of the

23

word requires, rather than the verb means, implies that

24

two are necessary but not necessarily sufficient.

25

when we're construing a provision in which the Court

And

So

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

has already recognized that, at least in some

2

instances, Congress' use of varying verbs to introduce

3

the different subsections will be taken as significant

4

--

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but if we're trying to

6

think of what they were getting at, it's possible that

7

Congress was worried about organized crime taking over

8

the pizza parlor or taking over a trades union or

9

taking over a similar kind of enterprise.

10
11

So that's

what they're thinking about.
Now, if we're thinking about that, they put

12

in the word groups of individuals because they

13

understand that organized crime could take over a group

14

of individuals.

15

vast amounts of conspiracy law.

Now, once you do that, you RICO-ize

16

MR. STEWART:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I don't think -But -- but they had no

18

reason whatsoever for doing the same thing for what we

19

have are associations of trade unions with each other

20

or associations of -- of corporations with each other.

21

And to do that, adding that in when it doesn't say

22

that, would RICO-ize, with its treble damages and

23

private plaintiffs and everything, vast amounts of

24

ordinary commercial activity, not ordinary only in

25

that, but importantly, a certain amount of criminal

2

is involved.

3

that has not to do with organized crime.

have to do with taking over legitimate enterprises.

5

But Congress wouldn't have wanted to -That does not

interacting with each other.

10
11

They're worried about

They're not worried about

And I'm trying to put the argument the other
way, and I wanted see what you respond.

12

MR. STEWART:

I mean, in terms of speculation

13

about Congress's motive, I think you're very likely

14

right that the reason Congress added a specific

15

reference to groups of individuals was that they were

16

thinking in terms of mob families or syndicates,

17

criminal gangs that had no discrete status as a legal

18

entity.

19

unit.

20

they wanted to make sure those were covered even though

21

they were not discrete legal entities.

22

They're not incorporated, but they function as

And they had those in mind, and they intended --

And I think you're likely right that the

23

reason they didn't specifically include groups of

24

corporations is that they didn't have them in mind as

25

likely sources of trouble at the time.

But that

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

doesn't answer the question whether they intended to

2

exclude the coverage of those alliances if they would

3

otherwise be encompassed by the normal meaning of the

4

term enterprise.

5

And if it came to cause the --

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're -- you're willing to

6

go this far with them.

7

groups of individuals, and throw them away.

8

saying after we throw them away, they're still covered,

9

and the reason that they're still covered is even

You say take those words,
And you're

10

though the word enterprise includes any individual,

11

partnership, corporation, the word enterprise also

12

includes groups of legal entities, groups of trades

13

unions, groups of associations, even without that word

14

group of individuals.

15

MR. STEWART:

Exactly.

If -- if the term

16

enterprise appeared in 1962(c) but were an undefined

17

term --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, is there

19

any indication in the legislative history or anywhere

20

else in the statute that this meaning of the word

21

enterprise is what is intended, that is, that this

22

meaning of the word enterprise went beyond what it says

23

here, excluding group of individuals?

24
25

MR. STEWART:
legislative history.

There -- there is in the

1-800-FOR-DEPO

describes the coverage of the term enterprise as

2

encompassing any associative group.

3

Now, we don't contend from that stray

4

reference that Congress specifically had in mind

5

alliances between corporations and specifically

6

intended to include them.

7

that legislative history is inconsistent with the

8

hypothesis that Congress anticipated the problem of

9

alliances of corporations and carefully --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What we do contend is that

Mr. Stewart, this -- this

11

thing is at least -- at least -- ambiguous.

12

shouldn't we apply the rule that we normally apply with

13

regard to criminal statutes that where there is an

14

ambiguity, the rule of lenity applies and we shouldn't

give the -- the Government license to -- to ride closer

there are two potential sources of ambiguity.

construed -- nobody is contending --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's irrelevant because

4

it's not taken alone.

5

the only question is what this -- what this definition

means.

7

really the only issue.

MR. STEWART:

9

It is defined.

So the only --

Is it exclusive or not exclusive?

That's

The -- the only question is

whether this list should be taken to exclude things

that are not on the list even though they would

otherwise be encompassed by the normal meaning of the

12

word enterprise.

13

given Congress a template.

14

means/includes dichotomy, we will take that choice to

15

be advertent and we will assume that when you use means

16

that's intended to be exclusive; when you use includes,

17

that's intended to be not exclusive.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And this Court in many decisions has
It said if you use the

Even -- even when it's

19

absolutely clear and -- and as pointed out by -- by

20

your friend, you -- you did not refute the point that

21

in other sections where it says includes, it is

22

unquestionable that it is exclusive.

23

MR. STEWART:

That -- that was part of

24

Justice Alito's question, and I think there are two

25

different senses in which a statutory list could be

would be legal exclusivity.

it prohibited conduct that was classic mob activity,

8

but it wasn't on the list of RICO predicates, we would

say that's out, it's not racketeering within the

That is, one

For instance, the

That definition is legally exclusive in the

10

meaning of the statute even though it would be

racketeering activity within a common understanding.

12

I think with the definition of Attorney

13

General, what we have is a different sort of

14

comprehensiveness.

15

definition of Attorney General is comprehensive in the

16

sense of actually listing all the people who could

17

otherwise plausibly be regarded as standing in the

18

shoes of the Attorney General.

19

Congress, when it promulgated the list, got everything

20

that would have been covered anyway.

21

comprehensive or legally exclusive in the sense of

22

directing courts that even an official who would

otherwise be regarded as an appropriate surrogate for

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, a State attorney -- a

State attorney general wouldn't fall within subsection

10.

4

Would -- would that be the case?
MR. STEWART:

I -- I agree with that, but I

5

don't think that in the context of a Federal statute

6

referring to the Attorney General, a State attorney

7

general would typically be encompassed within the

8

meaning of that provision even if the provision were

9

undefined, whereas I think because executive power is

11

officials standing in the shoes of a cabinet officer

reference to the cabinet officer alone.

with the word includes, then follows a -- a listing, A,

20

B, C, and D, and then it repeats one, but only one, of

21

the items on the list and says groups of these items,

22

i.e., individuals, are included?

23

peculiarity of the definition.

24

appeals come to grips with that?

MR. STEWART:

That's the

Do any of the courts of

I don't know of any court of

1

appeals opinion that really focus on that -- focuses on

2

that aspect of the question.

3

But -- but, again, we can accept kind of the

4

factual premises about what led Congress to draft the

5

legislation as it did, namely that it anticipated the

6

problem of groups of individuals banding together to

7

commit criminal acts and didn't anticipate the problem

8

of groups of corporations banding together for like

9

purposes.

10

But I think the whole point of having a

11

template, having an established rule that means and

12

includes, when they're used in the same statutory

13

provision will be taken as meaning different things, as

14

to give Congress a clue that if you've tried to list

15

everything but you're not sure that you've got it all,

16

here's the way that you can ensure that some new

17

arrangement that would otherwise fall within the

18

defined term is not going to be knocked out, and if you

19

want it to be knocked out, use the words means.

20

With respect to the second argument, that the

21

-- the core of Petitioner's position is that it can't

22

be held liable under RICO because it's simply

23

conducting its own business, and I think that's wrong

24

for two reasons.

25

First, there's no rule that says a

Washington, DC 20005

1

corporation can't simultaneously in a single act be

2

conducting its own business and the business of a

3

separate enterprise, and I think H.J., Incorporated is

4

an example of that.

5

that a utility corporation and its officers had engaged

6

in a systematic pattern of bribing the members of a

7

public utility commission to allow the corporation to

8

charge higher rates.

9

forward on the theory that through the pattern of

The allegation in that case was

And the suit was allowed to go

10

bribery, the utility was, in practical terms,

11

participating in the conduct of the public utility

12

commission's affairs.

13

Now, clearly in attempting to bribe the

14

utility commission members, the utility was, in a

15

sense, conducting its own business.

16

a high level of generality, efforts to persuade rate-

17

setting bodies to allow a utility to charge higher

18

rates are an integral part of the utility's own

19

business.

20

being a means of participating in the conduct of a

21

different entity's business.

22

That is, viewed at

That didn't prevent it from simultaneously

And second, there's more alleged in this

23

complaint, and I think some of the questions brought

24

this out.

25

May I finish my sentence?

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Justice Ginsburg, let me -- let me try to

11

justify having this issue before the Court.

12

all, 1292(b) has never been as narrowly confined as you

13

suggest, and indeed, in this case, you know, what

14

you're entitled to do is to bring up any issues related

15

to the challenged order.

16

raised the RICO issue, but we also raise State law

17

issues in the -- in the Eleventh Circuit which were not

18

within the specific grant and were entertained by the

19

Eleventh Circuit because that's the standard.

21

Kennedy is absolutely right.

22

there's an order to be reviewed.

24

courts of appeals, and therefore, it's -- it's

25

absolutely fair game.

The issue is whether

fairly subsumed within the question presented.

2

Justice Souter, you know, with respect to the

3

ID cards, I think it's very important to recognize that

4

for us to do our business, we have to have an ID card

5

in order to fill out the forms necessary to satisfy the

6

immigration laws.

7

add nothing to the -- to the conduct of our business.

8
9

So that -- you know, those ID cards

And, you know, Mr. Stewart just suggested
that, well, but you know, we do go beyond that and that

10

H.J. allows some a -- a different analysis of this

11

particular point.

12

held in Reves that you have to distinguish between the

13

activities of the enterprise and the activities of the

14

defendant and -- and they've never made any effort to

15

do that.

16

wrongdoing, that our third party recruiters engaged in

17

wrongdoing, and that we're a conspiracy.

18

nothing in there that remotely suggests that there is

19

an existing enterprise.

20

But H.J. preceded Reves.

This Court

All they do is suggest we've engaged in

There's

With respect to the question of how to

21

interpret this particular statute, Justice Scalia is

22

absolutely correct that at the end of the day, this is

23

at most an ambiguous provision, and if it's an

24

ambiguous provision, we ought to be entitled to the

25

rule of lenity.

we're just going to deal with background principles.

what we're talking about here.

this Court has recognized in the past, even on its own
