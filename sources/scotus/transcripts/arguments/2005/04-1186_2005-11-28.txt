CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether, for

11

purposes of Federal diversity jurisdiction, a national

12

bank is a citizen of every State where it has a branch,

13

or perhaps where it has any physical presence, or only

14

a citizen of the State where it was chartered or, if

15

different, where its main office is located.

16

The question turns on the meaning of the word

17

located in 28 U.S.C. 1348, which states that national

18

banking associations shall be deemed citizens of the

19

States in which they are respectively located.

20

Now, before turning to the --

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

22

it not, in 1887?

23

MR. FREY:

24

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

Now, that was enacted, was

That's correct.

The law --

And hasn't the -- the word

hasn't changed --

MR. FREY:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

3

And there were no interstate branches in

4
5

It hasn't changed.
-- in all those years.

1887, I assume.
MR. FREY:

I'm -- I'm not aware of any.

6

There may have been a few State banks that had

7

interstate branches, although they would have been

8

citizens only of the State of their incorporation.

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So it's a little hard to

10

look for congressional intent.

11

MR. FREY:

Well, it -- it -- I don't believe

12

it is, Your Honor, because of the sequence of statutes.

13

You have to start with the 1882 statute and what the

14
15

Supreme Court has said.
But -- but I'd like to make a preliminary

16

comment before I turn to the substantive points here,

17

which is that nobody has ever suggested, not the Fourth

18

Circuit and not the respondent, any reason why Congress

19

would want the result reached by the Fourth Circuit, in

20

-- in 1887 or in 1948 or any other relevant time, to

21

uniquely restrict the access of national banks to

22

Federal diversity jurisdiction.

23

Indeed, the suggestion is incongruous that

24

Congress would want to do that.

25

after all, federally created and federally regulated

National banks are,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Congress makes mistakes

sometimes.
MR. FREY:

Yes, they -- they might have --

they might have done that.

6

And I -- I acknowledge that this

7

consideration is not controlling, standing by itself,

8

on the case.

9

unambiguously called for such an implausible outcome,

That is, if the statute plainly and

10

then we might have a debate about whether an absurd

11

outcome that the plain language calls for is one that

12

should be enforced.

13

consideration that I don't think the Court can put

14

aside or deem irrelevant to the outcome of this case.

15

But this is a background

So the key holding of the Fourth Circuit was

16

that the word located has an unambiguous meaning, and

17

it's -- that it's the one adopted by the Fourth Circuit

18

majority and not by the Fourth Circuit dissent, the

19

Fifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Comptroller of

20

the Currency, or anybody else.

21

The battle of the dictionary definition seems

22

to me plainly inconclusive.

23

definitions is that they are cast in terms of the

24

location of tangible physical things, a table, a lake,

25

a piece of land; whereas we're dealing here with an

The biggest problem with the

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

incorporeal abstraction, a corporation, the location of

2

which is not necessarily tied to any particular

3

physical presence.

4

Both we and the Government have given Ford

5

Motor Company as an example in the brief.

6

somebody where is Ford Motor Company located, I venture

7

to say that most people would say Michigan.

8

you stop and think about it, it's possible that it

9

could be also located every place where it has

10
11

If you ask

But when

manufacturing facilities or sales outlets.
The only dictionary definition that I've seen

12

that is specific to the location of an incorporeal

13

entity, and specifically a bank, is the one that's

14

cited in the Chase -- JPMorgan Chase amicus brief,

15

which was taken from the 1951 edition of Black's Law

16

Dictionary, roughly contemporaneous with the enactment

17

of current section 1348, which states that a bank is,

18

quote, located, close quote, in the place specified in

19

its organization certificate.

20

The term also appears many places in the

21

National Bank Act, sometimes meaning a specific

22

headquarters location and sometimes meaning any place

23

where there are physical facilities.

24
25

And the Court -- this Court itself has given
located -- the word located various meanings.

In the

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Bougas case, which is much discussed in the briefs, the

2

Court said that the term has no enduring rigidity, and

3

the Court did not base its decision on the inherent or

4

natural or ordinary meaning of the word located.

5

In Federal Power Commission v. Texaco, which

6

is 377 U.S. 33, the Court interpreted the words in the

7

venue statute for appeals from Federal Power Commission

8

decisions which said the appeal could be taken to the

9

place where the company seeking review was located.

10

Texaco said, well, we have substantial facilities in

11

the Tenth Circuit.

12

this arose in the Tenth Circuit.

13

at the statute and it said, no, located means where --

14

your place of incorporation.

This matter that is the subject of

15

Now --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the Court looked

Counsel, a -- a

17

national bank charter typically lists the national

18

bank's principal place of business.

MR. FREY:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. FREY:

Correct?

Well, it lists -Its main office.

-- it lists the -- the charter

22

location, where it's established.

23

would have been synonymous with its principal place of

24

business.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And until 1994, that

But isn't that

amended if the principal place of business changes?

2

The charter is amended.

3

MR. FREY:

You can -- just like a corporation

4

could reincorporate in another State, a bank could move

5

its main office, which I think is the term that's used

6

in 12 U.S.C., section 30.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So this would put

8

national banks in a favored position compared to

9

corporations --

10

MR. FREY:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.
-- which are citizens

12

of their State of incorporation and their -- their

13

principal place of business.

14

MR. FREY:

Well, if there's -- I don't know

15

whether there's a divergence between principal place of

16

business and -- and main office, which is what the

17

Comptroller, I think, considers the equivalent of the

18

place of incorporation.

19

It is possible.

But remember, at the time all of these

20

statutes were enacted, there would have been complete

21

parity because principal place of business was not --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

MR. FREY:

My point is just --

A corporation was not a citizen of

24

-- of its principal place of business, only of its

25

State of incorporation.

So there would have been total

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

parity in 1882, 1887, 1911, 1948.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A good bit of your

3

argument is that your friend's interpretation on the

4

other side would put national banks in a disfavored

5

position.

6

MR. FREY:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
Your argument would

8

put them in a favored position compared to a typical

9

corporation.

10

MR. FREY:

Well, not necessarily.

You could

11

interpret located to include principal place of

12

business.

13

because what -- what you have to decide is whether the

14

fact that the bank has a branch in South Carolina means

15

they're located in South Carolina.

16

not Wachovia's principal place of business or --

17

This issue doesn't arise in this case

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

South Carolina is

Well, what would -- what

18

would be your view?

19

us, but suppose we had a question like the principal

20

place of business.

21

MR. FREY:

I know the question is not before

Our -- our view is that it's the

22

main office.

23

from the Government who can speak for the Comptroller

24

on this question, but our view would be that it's the

25

main office.

I would defer somewhat to my colleague

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And -- and I think it's important to

2

understand that when we're interpreting these statutes,

3

at every time when one of these -- when the statute was

4

reenacted, there would have been total parity between

5

our definition of located.

There would have been one

6

place for a national bank.

There would have been one

7

citizenship for a State bank.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Frey, in practice, is

there, as there often is for a corporation, a

10

divergence between those two places?

11

corporations incorporated in Delaware with their

12

principal place of business, say, in Michigan.

13

You have many

In the case of a national bank, is there that

14

similar difference that what you call its main office

15

or where it's chartered is different from where it has

16

its principal place of business?

17

MR. FREY:

It's possible that there would be

18

for some banks, but the main office is the place that

19

-- that the Comptroller that -- that is in their

20

articles of association, which can be amended to change

21

the main office, and it's approved by the Comptroller

22

of the Currency.

23

office.

24
25

And -- and they can move their main

Whether it -- all -- I know that in the case
of Wachovia, there is no divergence.

North Carolina is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

its main office and is its principal place of business.

2

But I can't speak for everything.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you would say that

4

the main office is the place where they're established.

5

Is that what you think the word established refers to?

6

MR. FREY:

No.

I'm not sure what the word

7

established means.

8

Court said in Bougas, it wasn't going there, and I

9

don't know that we need to go there today.

10
11

That would be different.

As the

Established

-JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I -- I think we need

12

to go there, at least -- it seems strange to me that

13

you have two different words and if, indeed,

14

established means the same thing that you're telling us

15

located means, I'm not going to agree with you.

16

mean, they're -- they're two different words --

17

MR. FREY:

I

Well, established could, I

18

suppose, mean the place of the original charter

19

location, and located could mean the place where --

20

where the main office is today.

21

different things.

22

They could mean

Remember that at every -- at every enactment

23

of this statute, there was no difference between

24

25

application because a national bank had only one

The terms had no different

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

location, which was the place where it was established.

2

So as a practical matter, there was total parity with

3

State banks because up until 1958 a corporation was a

4

citizen only of the -- its place of incorporation, and

5

there was total parity with national banks because they

6

were -- they were confined to their original State.

7

They could not branch outside their State until 1994.

8

So we are interpreting statutes that were passed for the

9

purpose of achieving parity and at a time when they

10
11

succeeded in achieving parity.
And -- and the Chief Justice's question and

12

-- and your question suggest that today, with the

13

changes in the map of interstate banking, you might

14

have some small lack of total overlap between State

15

banks or other corporations, on the one hand, and

16

national banks.

17

national banks are citizens of every place where they

18

have any physical presence.

19

But that is not a reason to say that

And one of the problems with the Fourth

20

Circuit's reading is that it injects substantial

21

ambiguity into the question of where a bank is located.

22

It's -- the Fourth Circuit said branches, but what

23

about where it has an office that's not a branch?

24

about where it stores -- where it has warehouses that

25

store its records?

What

What about where it has employees?

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. FREY:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or an ATM.

What about where it has an ATM.
Well, there I think the

4

Fourth Circuit said we -- we had a case that resolved

5

that.

6

MR. FREY:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me?
I think the Fourth Circuit

8

said that we had a case that -- that answered that

9

question, not a case involving this particular

10

provision --

11

MR. FREY:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13
14

I don't -- I don't recall.
-- but a case involving

another provision of -- of the banking laws.
MR. FREY:

I don't recall that.

I don't

15

recall that, but I think the -- I think the question is

16

not at all clear where -- where a bank would be located

17

if it's in a State where it has facilities, property,

18

or employees but not a branch.

19

concurring opinion in Sisson against Ruby, it's not a

20

good idea to have a jurisdictional statute -- reading

21

of a jurisdictional statute that creates ambiguities.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And as you said in your

Mr. Frey, remind me of the

23

State bank.

24

purposes, a citizen of two -- two places or only one?

25

A State bank is, for Federal diversity

MR. FREY:

It depends on how it does

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

business.

A State bank is a corporation and it is --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. FREY:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

-- the same as any corporation.
-- its place of

incorporation and --

MR. FREY:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

business if it's different.

9

So it would be the --

MR. FREY:

Same as any corporation.
-- principal place of

So in 1958, under -- if -- if you

10

follow the Chief Justice's question, in 1958 when it

11

became possible for corporations to be citizens of more

12

than one State, maybe the meaning of this statute that

13

was passed in 1948 changed.

14

makes sense.

15

statute that Congress passed in 1948.

16

there was complete parity.

17

Congress perceived a problem which is not a problem

18

with national banks, where there was a divergence, a

19

serious divergence, between the place of incorporation

20

and the principal place of business that Congress said

21

we've got to deal with this problem.

22

amended section 1332 in 1958 to deal with that

them to change --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you're --

3

you're asking us to interpret a statute that they

4

passed in light of events subsequent to the passage of

5

the statute.

6

MR. FREY:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.
You're saying that

8

when they passed it, national banks were only in one

9

place. Well, they were only located in one place --

10

MR. FREY:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

That's true.
-- even if you adopt

the reading of the Fourth Circuit.

13

MR. FREY:

Well, let me -- let's -- let's go

14

back and -- because Justice O'Connor started me off,

15

and I -- I don't want to fail to get to her question.

16

The first statute was the 1882 statute.

The

17

1882 statute unambiguously stated that the jurisdiction

18

shall be the same as and not other than the

19

jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not

20

organized under any law of the United States.

21

-- the purpose of Congress was to -- to give national

22

banks access to diversity jurisdiction on the same

23

basis as State banks.

24

Manufacturers Bank case, that was recognized by the

25

Court.

So the

And that -- in the Leather

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Then in 1887, Congress went to a different

2

wording totally.

3

-- I should point out that the 1882 statute was in the

4

Bank Act and the 1887 statute was in the Judiciary Act.

5

It injected the word location.

And I

So it was -- it's not clear what they thought they

6

were doing with the 1882 statute when they adopted the

7

1887 statute.

8
9

But it is clear what this Court said they
were doing in the Petri case.

This Court said no

10

reason is perceived why it should be held that Congress

11

intended that national banks should not resort to

12

Federal tribunals as other corporations and individual

13

citizens might.

14

of 142 U.S., the clause was intended to have and must

15

receive the same effect and operation as that of the

16

proviso to the fourth section of the act of July 12,

17

1882.

18

limitation in the regard of access to Federal

19

diversity jurisdiction was intended.

20

It then said further on, on page 651

And finally, they close by saying, no

Then we have the 1911 codification, and in --

21

and after 1911, we have several Supreme Court cases,

22

including the Mitchell case, which again says that the

23

codification worked no change.

24

that as to suits with -- within the specified

25

exceptions, national banks were, by the acts of 1882

It says, the Court held

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

and 1887, put on the same basis in respect of

2

jurisdiction as if they had not been organized under an

3

act of Congress.

4

And then in 1948, you have the reenactment or

5

the codification of the current judicial code, not

6

intended to work any change in the meaning of the

7

statute.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you think a lawyer has

to go back, in order to advise a client, and -- and

10

when he has a word -- two words in -- in a provision --

11

one, established; the other, located -- he has to go

12

back and figure out every one of these reenactments and

13

inquire into, you know, what Congress meant at the

14

time?

15
16
17

MR. FREY:

Well, I don't think it's so

difficult to -JUSTICE SCALIA:

He -- he has -- he has a

18

statute that says established in one part, located in

19

another, and he has a Supreme Court case, which I

20

mentioned, but you apparently disregard, which is

21

Bougas, which --

22

MR. FREY:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't disregard it.
Well, which -- when I asked

24

about it, you -- you drew a blank.

25

case I was referring to.

I mean, that's the

And in -- which had a similar

said that established meant one thing and said what in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

10

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

11
12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

13

For purposes of determining its State

14

citizenship under 28 U.S.C. 1348, a national banking

15

association is located in the State in which its main

16

office is found, not every State in which it may

17

maintain a branch office or other form of physical

18

presence.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about its principal

20

place of business if it's different from its main

21

office?

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24
25

The -Principal place of

business.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

We -- we don't think that a

20
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

national banking association is a citizen of a State in

2

which its principal place of business is found, insofar

3

as that might be different from the State in which its

4

main office is located.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the main office is it,

6

like 1332 before the '58 amendment.

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right, Justice

8

Ginsburg, and in part, that's because of the historical

9

chronology.

The word located was first used in 1887

10

and the current version of section 1348 was enacted in

11

1948, which was 10 years before the concept of

12

principal place of business had any jurisdictional

13

salience.

14

this was in 1958 -- that Congress enacted a specific

15

provision dealing with corporate citizenship, and

16

that's the first time that we see the concept of

17

principal place of business having relevance in the

18

jurisdictional context.

19

That was the first time that Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

argue in Bougas?

21

the case.

22

case?

What did the Government

I -- I didn't look up the briefs in

Did the Government appear in -- in that

23

MR. SRINIVASAN:

24

But -- but Bougas I think is -- shouldn't

25

No.

govern the resolution of this case for several reasons,

21
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

and one that I think is salient with respect to the

2

points that you were raising earlier, Justice Scalia,

3

is that it really is a happenstance of codification

4

that the terms, established and located, appear

5

together in section 1348.

6

established and the paragraph that contained located

7

were enacted in separate years.

8

separate subjects, and they were always treated as

9

separate provisions until the recodification of the

The paragraph that contained

They concerned

10

judicial code in 1911.

11

in its explicit text that the provisions were -- were

12

to continue to carry the substantive meaning that they

13

had beforehand and that the arrangement of the

14

provisions were purely -- was purely for convenience.

15

And so I don't think it's fair to say that because

16

established and located happen to appear in the same

17

provision of section 1348 that they necessarily should

18

be given different meanings.

19

And that recodification stated

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In Bougas, they were there

20

to -- they were put in originally in the original

21

drafting.

22

They were paired, right?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Just about, Justice Souter.

23

I -- the -- the paragraph containing established was

24

in there in the 1863 National Banking Law, and -- and

25

the provision containing located was added to that

22

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

provision in 1864.

2

appeared, they did appear together, which is another

3

distinction from the circumstance that the Court faces

4

with respect to 1348.

5

So the first time that they both

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could I -- could I

6

get your position again on exactly 1348?

7

office is where the bank is located?

8

MR. SRINIVASAN:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

You say main

That's right.
What about if that's

different from the national bank charter?

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It would still be the main

12

office.

13

it's called the organization certificate under the

14

terms of the statute -- is a historic document that

15

documents where the national bank's initial main office

16

was located.

17

relocate its main office under 12 U.S.C. 30.

18

think that when a national bank relocates its main

19

office, it's the current main office that's

20

controlling.

21
22
23

25

The -- the national bank charter -- I think

But, of course, a national bank can

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

You don't.

In fact -- in

4

What you have to do is amend your articles of

5

association if you move the main office -- if you move

6

the main office outside the city or town in which the

7

main office previously was found.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How -- how do you

tell where a bank's main office is?

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, as I was saying, you'd

11

have to amend the articles of association if you move

12

to a different city.

13

of association, and those are on file with the

14

Comptroller.

15

office is located is readily identifiable and it's

16

publicly available information.

17

So you could look at the articles

So I think where a national bank's main

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So its main office

18

would be -- be where its articles of incorporation say,

19

even if it has 90 percent of its branches in another

20

State?

21

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right.

It's -- it's

22

-- the main office is -- is controlled by where the

23

national bank designates its main office to be.

24

Now, it's a little bit different than

25

corporations in the following sense, that with the main

24
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

office of a national bank, it at least has to be a

2

place where the bank is conducting the business of

3

banking.

4

with a corporation, you could conceivably have a

5

situation where they were incorporated in one State --

That's required by the statutes.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Whereas

So you can have these

7

banks -- I don't know -- presumably a State that they

8

bear little or no relation to could offer some

9

favorable treatment of them and they could suddenly

10

say, you know, Wachovia's main office is in Wyoming or

11

something, even though it doesn't -- it has one -- it

12

has one ATM or one branch there.

13

right with you?

14

located?

That would be where -- where they were

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

And that would be all

That's right, for -That would be the

only place that they were located.

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

For purposes of this

19

provision.

20

the word located encompasses branch locations, but for

21

purposes of this provision, we think location is

22

synonymous with main office.

23

There -- there are other provisions where

And I would say that the court of appeals

24

assumed in its opinion, by the way -- and this is at

the Chief Justice's example, say they decided they want

there have been any reason why they couldn't do it?

change.

I -- I think so.

I don't --

I'm not aware of any criterion by which -- substantive

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Does the term, main office,

2

have any significance for -- for any purpose other than

3

this jurisdictional issue in this case?

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Yes.

It -- it has

5

significance in a number of provisions.

6

it determines where the bank is located with respect to

7

what interest rates it might charge under 12 U.S.C. 85,

8

and that's an issue that this Court confronted a few

9

terms ago in the Smiley case and also in the Marquette

10

case.

11

But there are other provisions that refer to

12

the -- the location of a national banking association,

13

and in all of those we think, as a starting point, the

14

location would be the main office, and in some

15

situations, it would also encompass branch locations.

16

For purposes of this provision, we don't

17

think that the location would encompass branch

18

locations.

19

the subject that section 1348 deals with is the State

20

citizenship of a national banking association.

21

concept of citizenship has always been thought to

require a distinctive association with a State and, in

particular, has been thought to require something more

associations as, quote, a body corporate, close quote,

And Congress defined national banking

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you another

7

question that is really a follow-up on the Chief

8

Justice's earlier -- for a private corporation, it's

9

located both where it's incorporated and where it has

10

its principal place of business.

11

a national bank may have two parallel locations or just

12

one?

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Is it your view that

It -- it could have a main

14

office that's different from what one would construe to

15

be its principal place of business under the test that

16

applies to corporations under 1332(c), if -- if that's

17

what you're asking, so that factual circumstances --

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It could -- it could have a

19

-- it could be a citizen of the State where its -- its

20

papers say its main office is and also the State where,

21

in fact, its main office is.

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No.

Well, I -- well, I

23

don't -- in fact, its main office is -- is a creature

24

of statutory designation, but I think what --

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I should use a

28
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

different word.

2

--

Where its principal place of business

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Principal place of business.
-- they have a big

5

operation in New York and a -- and a Delaware

6

headquarters in -- in Dover.

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No.

Our view is that it

8

wouldn't be a citizen of a State simply by virtue of

9

the fact that it has its principal place of business

10
11

there.
Now, I would say, though, that it's not an

12

open and shut case because the Court in a case that

13

specifically raised the issue, which of course this one

14

doesn't, it could construe 1332(c), which is the

15

provision that deals with corporations generally, as

16

also applying to national banking associations insofar

17

as national banking associations are, after all,

18

corporations.

19

But we think the better reading is that the

20

specific governs the general, and therefore, that

21

section 1348, which specifically deals with the

22

question of national bank citizenship, would govern

23

over the 1332(c) which more generally deals with the

24

question of corporate citizenship.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if we did -- if we did

2

interpret 1332(c) that way, there wouldn't be any

3

favoritism for national banks.

4
5
6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right.

It would

entirely eliminate favoritism.
But I think it's important to note that the

7

type of favoritism that we're discussing is the

8

potential inequity as between one State and two States;

9

whereas under the court of appeals' interpretation of

10

section 1348, you could have an inequity that -- and

11

it's not farfetched to think -- that would encompass 50

12

States in the case of a national banking association

13

and one or two States in the case of a State

14

corporation.

15

And so we're --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what do you

16

mean that national banking associations are, after all,

17

corporations?

18

from corporations.

19

I thought they were distinct entities

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No.

They're -- they're not

20

State chartered corporations.

21

chartered corporations, but they are corporate in the

22

-- as -- as distinguished from other sort of forms that

23

an entity, an incorporeal entity, may take.

Congress specifically provided that in 12 U.S.C. 24 --

-- when it defined them as,

makes sense to apply the normal rules that we apply to

They're not

of any State, though.

8
9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

They're not incorporated

under the laws of any State, but they're incorporated

10

under -- under the National Bank Act.

11

federally chartered corporations like other federally

12

chartered corporations.

13

it makes sense to apply the normal rules that apply to

14

corporate citizenship to national banks.

15

They're

And so in that sense, we think

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- I'm sorry.

16

Maybe this is something everybody knows but me.

17

would have thought that a national association is

18

distinct from a corporation in a way, for example, that

19

a partnership is distinct from a corporation.

20

wouldn't have assumed that the laws with respect to

21

corporations automatically applied to national banking

22

associations.

23

4

characteristics of a corporation, i.e., there's limited

5

liability for shareholders -- and that's at 12 U.S.C.

same way that corporations do, and that's at 12 U.S.C.

That -- that's our view, but

13

again, I'm -- I wouldn't characterize it an -- as an

14

open and shut case because 1332(c) refers generally to

corporations, and so one could reach the conclusion

that 1332's reference to principal place of business

should also apply to national banks.

Before I do that, I want -- I want to say so

I'll be sure I don't forget it.

pointed out, Mr. Chief Justice, that a national bank is

9

not a corporation, but it is a association formed under

10

Federal law.

11

can look or anybody can look to determine what their

12

citizenship is.

13

said it was a quasi-public institution, national in

14

character.

15

corporation.

16

So there's no State to which this Court

In fact, in the Langdeau case, they

So it's not a -- it's not a State
It's got no ties to a State corporation.

So if it's going to have citizenship for diversity

17

purposes, Congress has got to say how we going to

18

figure that out.

And that's what they did in 1448.

19

This Court, in a series of cases back in the

20

mid-'80's, was faced with the -- with the issue of how

21

do you determine the citizenship of a corporation, and

22

it went back and forth but finally came down with a

23

doctrine that said a corporation will be deemed a

24

citizen of the State in which it is incorporated.

25

And then in 1958, Congress enacted 1332 and

33
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

added the additional clause of principal place of

2

business.

3

Now, given that it is a national association

4

and it's not a State corporation, it was necessary for

5

Congress to legislate and enact a statute so we could

6

determine how it would have diversity.

7

they did in 28-1448.

8
9

And that's what

And going to the question Justice Scalia
asked, do we have to go back and look at all of this

10

statutory history -- and you can believe I've been

11

looking at it a lot more than I'd like to have lately.

12

It kind of ruined my holiday.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. GILREATH:

But I think I understand it.

15

And my answer to your question is that you do not.

16

When Congress enacts a statute that says you are deemed

right here -- deemed to be a citizen of the State in

which you're respectively located, I don't know how

20

Congress can speak much clearer.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let me -- let me raise the

22

reality check question.

23

is not the only possible reading of that statute, why

24

in the world would Congress have wanted to impose the

25

-- the system that follows from -- from your result in

If -- if we assume that that

34
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

which the -- the national banks are -- are excluded

2

from diversity jurisdiction to a degree that the State

3

banks clearly are not?

4

MR. GILREATH:

I don't think, when Congress

5

enacted section 1448, that they even knew about branch

6

banking.

7

has evolved really since 1994 when the Neal-Riegle Act

8

was enacted.

9

The -- the -- that -- that is something that

So the statute says --

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the -- I guess the

11

problem is if -- if we start with the assumption that I

12

made a second ago that your reading is not a necessity

13

-- it's a possible reading.

14

if -- if we assume that it's not an absolute necessity,

15

we -- we try to avoid freakish results, and this seems

16

like a freakish result.

17

it may be a freakish result.

18

Congress intended it.

19

think, with the problem of a -- a reading which is not

20

absolutely necessary that does produce a freakish

21

result.

22

lose?

23

No question about it.

But

And I take it your answer is
We're not claiming that

But that still leaves us, I

And if that's the case, why shouldn't you

MR. GILREATH:

Well, that assumes that you

24

want to give the -- the -- I'm not suggesting that you

25

-- you want to do this, but that -- that a court would

35
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

want to give the national banks what I say is a free

2

ticket to the Federal courts, to the --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No.

The question is why

4

would Congress -- let's assume we have a choice between

5

two readings.

6

State courts -- the State banks -- State banks --

7

greater access to Federal courts than it gives national

8

banks?

9

wanting to do that?

Why would Congress want to give the

10

What earthly reason would there be for Congress

MR. GILREATH:

I can't -- I can't give you a

11

reason for that.

12

they don't want to give greater access one way or the

13

other, but they've got to write a statute.

14

they wrote the statute, nobody had in mind what the

15

branch banking system was going to be today.

16

now what this Court is faced with is they are looking

17

at a statute that, when you read it literally, says

18

that they ought to be deemed to be a citizen of South

19

Carolina if they have a branch in South Carolina.

20

I -- I would suggest that they --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does that make them located in Wyoming?

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- what about if we go

3

back to 1880 or whatever and they had a messenger?

4

know, they only had one office, but they had depositors

5

in different States, and this messenger went from State

6

to State handing out the cash and collecting a fee.

7

Would Congress at that time have considered that bank

8

to be located in all the States where the messenger

9

showed up?

10

MR. GILREATH:

You

I'm -- I'm not sure that even

11

I could say that located goes quite that far.

even sure that back then the -- the statutes would have

allowed them to have had a messenger, but assuming it

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's all that's --

that's all that's -- and that's all that's in the

Are they located in that State?

9

They've got a presence there

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I think they would

May I ask you -- call your

attention to another word in the statute that seems

10

persuasive to me?

11

statute says all national banking associations shall

12

be, for the purposes of all other actions by or against

13

them, be deemed citizens of the State in which they are

14

respectively located, which I would read as saying in

15

which each of them is located.

16

It's the word respectively.

MR. GILREATH:

The

Isn't that --

That -- that's the way I read

17

it, and we -- we discussed that in our brief, that --

18

that word.

19

away from the position that we've got, but I -- I agree

20

with what you're saying.

21

We -- we said more so that it doesn't take

It could be each State.

And -- and the statute also says States, in

22

the plural, in which they're located.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They're talking about a

24

plural banking associations, not just plural branches

25

of one association.

And it's in which each -- in which

38
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

they are respectively located, which strikes me as

2

saying in -- in which each of those national banking

3

association is located, which seems to me to read as

4

though there's only one location for each bank.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that -- that would be

6

true if it said the State in which they are -- in which

7

they are respectively located, but it does say of the

8

States.

9
10
11
12
13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's what it does say:

the States in which they are respectively located.
JUSTICE SCALIA:
many States.

Yes, so each one could be in

No?

MR. GILREATH:

I read it, because it says

14

States, that it's referring to more than one State in

15

which they could be located.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And of course, it refers to

17

more than one State because it referred to even more

18

than one national bank association.

19

associations, and then it says, each of them shall be

20

deemed a citizen of the State in which -- it says in

21

the plural -- in which they are respectively located.

22

MR. GILREATH:

It's a plural

I think what -- what we said

23

in our brief was that the word respectively is -- is in

24

there so that you are not talking about all the banks,

25

but talking about each bank.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Correct.

That's exactly

right.

MR. GILREATH:

If I could move on.

There are

4

many different business entities that anybody can elect

5

to -- to do business under.

Justice raised earlier, a limited partnership, for

7

instance, is deemed to have the citizenship of all of

8

its various partners.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As I think the Chief

11

MR. GILREATH:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, in other words, the

incorporated and Congress said a principal place of

17

subject matter jurisdiction, that is, which court

18

system you go to, as distinguished from personal

19

jurisdiction or venue, you have a notion that someone

20

is a citizen of every place where it does the business.

21

We have a partnership where each partner is
I don't know of any instance where for

I don't know of any.

It's the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- it's the same for a limited liability company as it

2

is for a partnership I believe, that you have to -- you

3

have to look through it.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

MR. GILREATH:

Its members.

But the point -- the point I

6

was making is that it -- it doesn't necessarily have to

7

be the same rule that it is for a corporation, and --

8

and that -- that's what this Court decided in the

9

Carden case.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but the question that

11

I asked you is, in the realm of subject matter

12

jurisdiction, that is, which court system, Federal or

13

State, as distinguished from where can I grab this

14

person for personal jurisdiction purposes, what are my

15

venue choices, is there any other example in all of

16

title 28 where, for subject matter jurisdiction

17

purposes, this -- every place where it's located

18

counts?

19

MR. GILREATH:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not -- not that I know of.
Do we owe any degree

21

of deference to the Comptroller's interpretation of the

22

provision?

23

MR. GILREATH:

There -- there is some

24

authority that I think is cited in their brief or

25

somebody's brief that the Court should give deference

41
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to -- to their interpretations.

But this Court is not

2

bound by their interpretations.

If -- if this Court

3

concludes that their interpretation is -- is clearly

4

incorrect, then it's not -- it's not bound by it.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This is not a matter of --

6

of -- over which the Comptroller has administrative

7

responsibility, is it?

8

for the courts as to what court these associations can

9

be -- can be sued in.

10

I mean, this is just a matter

And I don't see how the

Comptroller has any business in that area.

11

MR. GILREATH:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -I mean, I -- I guess he

13

deals with these associations all the time, so we

14

should -- we should listen to him, but -- but he -- he

15

is not authoritative as to -- as to who comes into

16

court, is he?

17

MR. GILREATH:

No.

I would agree.

In fact,

18

Congress has the final say-so, and then this Court has

19

got to look at what Congress says to interpret it.

20

Congress said, I say very simply, that they're deemed a

21

citizen of any State wherever they are located.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

What do you do with

23

their -- their hypothetical in both your friend's brief

24

and the Government's brief about Ford Motor Company,

25

not in terms of 1332 but common parlance?

If you ask

42
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

somebody where Ford Motor is located, they're likely to

2

respond by saying, well, what do you mean?

3

their headquarters?

4

the street?

5

suggest that located doesn't have the clear meaning

6

that you rely on.

7

Do you mean

Do you mean the -- the plant down

Do you mean the dealership?

MR. GILREATH:

It does

You -- you can make that

8

argument, but it -- it depends on, like you say, what

9

-- what do you mean when you ask that question.

If

10

you're going out to buy a Ford car, then you obviously

11

would want to know where it's located other than in

12

Michigan.

13

dealership is.

14

You'd want to know where the nearest Ford

Located, obviously, can have several

15

meanings, but that's one of the points, I think, that

16

Judge Luttig made in his opinion, is you've got to look

17

at it in the context in which it is said in the

18

statute.

19

which the word located is there, it says where -- in --

20

in the States where it's located.

21

And looking at the statute, in the context in

Now, there are other places in the statute,

22

which I'm sure they will argue or have argued in their

23

brief, that -- that say, you know, it's located, when

24

they're talking about a bank -- a branch bank where you

25

can do insurance or whatever, that it can -- it can

43
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

sell insurance in any branch where -- where it's

2

located, and that means another meaning to locate.

3

you've got to look at locate in the context in which

4

it's used, and --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But

But the -- the argument here

6

is -- is in the context of deciding which citizen an

7

entity is a citizen -- which State an entity is a

8

citizen of, we normally don't think that entities are

9

citizens of multiple States.

Just as you wouldn't

10

think if -- if you're asking, you know, where does the

11

Ford Motor Company manage its -- its operations from,

12

you wouldn't think from multiple States.

13

So here when you're talking about

14

citizenship, why doesn't this argument of context cut

15

precisely against you?

I mean, that -- that's an extraordinary result

MR. GILREATH:

I -- I agree.

A citizen is a

citizen.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So we should be looking for

one State or maybe two States at most.
MR. GILREATH:

Well, we -- I -- I contend --

24

I can understand why you say that, but if you read the

25

-- the statute the way it's worded and you -- and you

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

look at what's going on out there, I don't see any

2

problem with this Court construing that they are a

3

citizen of a State like South Carolina where they've

4

got 179 branches.

5

think, the ABA or one of the amicus, they've got

6

something like 3,600 branches.

7

The -- according to the brief by, I

Now, they come into South Carolina, they're

taking -- if I bank with them, they're taking my money

9

and the -- and the money of other millions of South

10

Carolinians and -- who -- who are entrusting their

11

money to them, as opposed to entrust it to a State

12

court, and if I'm banking with them, I've got to go sue

13

them in -- in Federal court.

14

with a --

personal jurisdiction is concerned, you have it in

20

South Carolina.

21

The only question is whether they would

MR. GILREATH:

No.

But as far as

I think if -- if we -- if

22

this Court adopts the position the petitioner wants,

23

they would be deemed a -- a citizen of North Carolina,

24

not South Carolina.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

would have to go file court -- file suit in a Federal

2

court to bring them to South Carolina where I would be

3

drawing a jury from 8 or 10 counties as opposed if they

4

were a State bank or --

5
6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
South Carolina.

7
8

But it would still be in

MR. GILREATH:

It would still be in South

Carolina.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the same would be

10

true if you were dealing with a State bank incorporated

11

in North Carolina with its principal place of business

12

in Virginia that had 50 branches in South Carolina.

13

The same thing --

14

MR. GILREATH:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

That's -- that's true.
-- would still be

true.

17

MR. GILREATH:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's exactly true.
And that's the parity

19

that Congress has -- that has been the guiding

20

principle of Congress' enactments in this area since

21

1882.

22

MR. GILREATH:

Well, I don't -- I don't know

23

whether I necessarily agree with that or with this

24

parity argument that they've got.

25

to address that just briefly, if I could, is the parity

I wanted -- I want

46
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

argument -- and -- and all of this parity argument they

2

get they get from -- from these 1882, 1885, 1887

3

statutes.

4

The parity argument is gone.

5

wanted parity, then where is parity in section 1448?

6

It's not there.

7

but those statutes have been repealed.

8

some doctrine or something in the Constitution.

9

think --

10

All of those statutes have been repealed.
If -- if Congress had

It was there in 1882, 1885 and '87,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Parity is not
So I

May I go -- may I go back

11

to the textual argument that Justice Scalia was

12

suggesting a little while ago?

13

normally a citizen is a citizen of only one place --

14

there are multiple -- there are other situations where

15

you have a dual citizen -- and that you would normally

16

assume they're only a citizen in one place, then

17

Congress, in order to solve the problem of corporate

18

headquarters in the private commercial world, corporate

19

headquarters, a main piece of business, went out of its

20

way to say corporations shall be deemed to be a citizen

21

of two places -- they made a special statute when they

22

could be a citizen of two places, which overcomes the

23

presumption that it's a citizen of only one place.

24

there's nothing to overcome the presumption that in

25

1348 they're assuming each citizen has only one place

If we presume that

But

47
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of citizenship because that statute just used the word

2

respectively.

3

respectively citizens of -- of different States.

4

think that's fully consistent with the notion, sort of

5

the basic background notion, that one person has one --

6

one citizenship; one corporation has only one place of

7

citizenship.

8
9
10
11

It talks about many banks but in --

MR. GILREATH:

But I

I can't -- I can't argue with

the logic that you've got.

But I -- I still come back

to the language of the statute.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, this -- I'm -- I'm

12

relying strictly on the statutory language in making

13

this argument.

14

MR. GILREATH:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are you talking about 1448?
Yes, because it doesn't say

16

anything about anybody being a -- capable of being a

17

citizen of two different places, whereas 1332 does,

18

which is the unusual situation.

19

MR. GILREATH:

I agree, but it says they

20

shall be deemed citizens of the States in which they

21

are respectively located.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23

MR. GILREATH:

Respectively.

The statute says State -- says

24

citizens, which to me says the statute is allowing you

25

to find that they can be a citizen of more than one

48
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

State.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

See, but it's clearly

3

unusual to say you can be a citizen of two places.

4

to do that, you had a special statute in 1332.

5

you can be a citizen of 40 or 50 States simultaneously,

6

there really is no precedent for that.

7

MR. GILREATH:

And

To say

I -- I can't argue with you,

8

but I -- I still come back, you know, to the statute.

9

I -- I think -- I think the real problem here is that

10

you've got a statute that was enacted in 1948 that

11

really, if you go back and look, it goes back to 1911.

12

And obviously, in 1911, nobody knew the proliferation

13

of branch banking that was going to take place.

14

knew the proliferation of branch banking that was going

15

to take place in -- in 1948 when it was enacted.

16

Nobody

And I think the real decision that this Court

17

has got to make is whether you -- you read the statute

18

and apply it or either whether you're going to leave it

19

to Congress to -- to make that change.

20

I'm not -- and -- and you may -- you may

21

apply it the way I'm arguing, and I hope you do.

22

it may be -- and -- and if you do, then the national

23

banking associations, with all the clout they've got,

24

can go over here across the street to Congress and they

25

can get it changed.

And

And you can bet they probably will

49
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

be trying.
But I think the real question is -- is are

3

you going to read the statute for what it says or are

4

you going to, you know, give it the reading they want

5

by going back in all this history and twisting and

6

turning to get to the point they want to get to.

7

They even -- I think this is one point I want

8

to make is if you look at their brief, right at the

9

last page of their brief -- and I think this highlights

10

the -- the problem that you've got is they say you

11

don't need to go so far as to determine two places.

12

They just want you to determine one place.

13

that highlights the fact of how far they're trying to

14

stretch the rubber band on this word to -- to get the

15

-- get the meaning that they want.

16

that ought to be left for another day.

17

And I think

They -- they say

And so I come back that the -- the ordinary

18

meaning of the word located should -- should put it in

19

each State.

20

and I think the statute is unambiguous.

21

The -- I -- I think this -- I come back

And that leads me to the -- the Bougas case,

22

which was talked about a little bit.

23

often that you have a statute where this Court has

24

already ruled, as it did in Bougas some 28 years ago, a

25

-- a virtually identical statute dealing with the

banking laws.

2

pari materia doctrine ought not to apply, but I mean,

3

you've got a statute there that's a -- a banking

4

statute, admittedly dealing with venue, where this

5

Court found the same meaning that we would like for it

6

to find here.

7

about established and located completely goes away

8

because the Court said whatever the reason behind the

9

distinction in those two words, it does exist and we

11

They -- they try to say, well, the in

The courts -- and -- and their argument

recognize it.
And -- and even if you say, well, in pari

12

materia doesn't apply -- and that's what they argue.

13

Judge Luttig said, well, it -- it's -- still there's

14

some authority that similar statutes should apply.

15

And here, we have a decision that's

16

construing an almost identical statute.

17

conclusion that -- that we would like.

18

It reaches the

In summary, kind of the way I look at it it's

19

kind of like in 1948 the Congress tailored a

20

citizenship suit of clothes for national banks, and --

21

and that suit of clothes, a pattern of which was laid

22

out even back into the -- the 19th century, still fits

23

the bill today.

may not work the way the banks want it to work, but it

across the street here to Congress and let it make that

enactment.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Frey, you have 2 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11
12

Thank you, counsel.

MR. FREY:
quickly.

13

Thank you, I'll try to speak

I just have a couple of points.
One is with regard to the spread of national

14

banks.

15

For instance, Sun Trust is a bank that's comparable in

16

scope to Wachovia.

17

It has many branches, I assume, in South Carolina.

18

yet, it is a citizen only of its home State, its State

19

of incorporation, or principal place of business.

20

There is a comparable spread of State banks.

It has operations in many States.
And

If there were a problem of abuse of

21

relocation, which I think the Court was a little bit

22

worried about, Congress would deal with it the way they

23

dealt with the abuses of corporate -- stated place of

24

incorporation by passing 1332(c).

25

So let me --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but if there were

2

the problems that you hypothesize here, Congress could

3

have dealt with them by enacting something that dealt

4

with the proliferation of branch banks rather than

5

interpreting the 1948 statute in light of 1980's --

6

MR. FREY:

It could have, but it saw no need.

7

There was a statute that had been consistently on the

8

books for a century that meant the same thing, which is

9

surely what Congress wanted.

Why would Congress bother

10

when it enacted Riegle-Neal and allowed interstate

11

branching, to say, by the way, just like State

12

corporations which conduct business in many States, you

13

know, the rule that we -- we've adopted that banks are

14

located in their main office or their charter location,

15

still applies?

16

That would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that's not

17

a rule that they've adopted.

18

they're citizens of wherever they're located.

MR. FREY:

All they say is that

But it's been interpreted by the

Court.

21

statutes, and each time the Court says it doesn't

22

change from the original 1882 meaning.

23

1882 statute then you have 1887, and the Court says this

24

means the same thing as 1882.

25

Court says this means the same thing as 1911.

It's -- it's been -- you have a series of

I think Langdeau says it means the same thing

Let me just, in the brief time I have left,

on in pari materia, which is at the heart of Justice

5

Scalia's question about the Bougas case.

cite two cases to the Court that I think are

instructive on this, United States against Granderson,

511 U.S. 39, and Fort Stewart Schools, 495 U.S. 641,

both refusing to apply the in pari materia doctrine
