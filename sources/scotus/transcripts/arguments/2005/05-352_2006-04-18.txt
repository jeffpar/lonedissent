ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

This Court has made clear in its

11

jurisprudence concerning the Sixth Amendment right to

12

the assistance of counsel that the core purpose of that

13

right is to secure a fair trial conducted in accordance

14

with adversary procedures.

15

As a result of the Court's analysis of that

16

purpose, this Court has required in its Sixth Amendment

17

assistance of counsel cases either a showing that

18

prejudice be demonstrated in a particular case to show

19

that a fair trial has not been guaranteed or that there

20

is a basis for presuming prejudice.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When did -- when did we

22

first hold that the State had to provide counsel if --

23

if the defendant could not afford his own counsel?

24

MR. DREEBEN:

25

decided in 1963, Justice Scalia.

I believe that Gideon was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's what we generally

2

mean nowadays by the right -- by -- by the right to

3

counsel.

4

objective, you're talking about the objective of that

5

newly discovered right to have counsel appointed.

6

And when you talk about fairness being its

But I don't know that fairness was the -- was

7

the object of the original right to counsel in the --

8

in the Bill of Rights, which -- which only applied to

9

-- to your ability to hire your own counsel, and if you

10

couldn't afford counsel, you didn't get one.

11

think that -- that fairness is the object of that.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

I hardly

Well, Justice Scalia, in fact,

13

this Court has recognized that under the Sixth

14

Amendment, as applied to the Federal Government, even

15

before the Sixth Amendment was made applicable to the

16

States through the Fourteenth Amendment, that it did

17

guarantee the right to appointed counsel if the

18

defendant --

19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:
holding to that effect?

21
22

MR. DREEBEN:

25

Johnson v. Zerbst, I believe,

was in the '30s.

23
24

When -- when was our first

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In the '30s.

Gee, that's

The -- the fact --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- that's hardly -- that's

2

hardly the original purpose and meaning of the Sixth

3

Amendment, and -- and you come here and say that its

4

fundamental purpose is something that is only the

5

purpose of the newly evolved Sixth Amendment and not of

6

the original one.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Scalia, our position on

8

what the purpose of the Assistance of Counsel Clause is

9

-- is drawn from what this Court has said that purpose

10

is in the way that it's elaborated it.

11

that if the Court looks at the spectrum of contexts in

12

which the Court has applied the Sixth Amendment right

13

to counsel, it's apparent that the most fundamental

14

aspect of the guarantee and the one that is most

15

indispensable to protecting the fairness of a trial,

16

which is the overarching goal of the Sixth Amendment,

17

is that the defendant have counsel by his side at all.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I think

I don't think that's the

19

overarching goal of the original.

20

very fundamental, that if you have funds with which you

21

can hire someone to speak for you, you should be able

22

to use all of your -- I mean, your -- no.

23

freedom is at stake.

24

your money to get the best spokesman for you as

25

possible. That's the element of fairness that I think

I think it's -- it's

Your -- your

You should be able to use all of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

2

is there.
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I -- I think that this

3

Court has made clear that the core element of fairness

4

is protecting the defendant's ability to have a lawyer

5

there at all, and if the lawyer is not there, the

6

essential fairness of the trial is in jeopardy.

7

it's for that reason --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. DREEBEN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

But until the 1930s that

element didn't exist.

10

12

And

There were -Until the 1930s, if you

didn't have the money, you didn't have counsel.
MR. DREEBEN:

That's not entirely true,

14

Justice Scalia, because there certainly were many

15

jurisdictions, even at the time of the founding, that

16

provided for the appointment of counsel if the

17

defendant was not able to retain his own counsel.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, excuse me.

As far as

19

the Constitution is concerned, if you didn't have the

20

money, you didn't have counsel.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

What this Court has done I

22

think, in the course of the 20th century jurisprudence

23

that has examined the right to counsel, is establish a

24

hierarchy of the critical rights that are necessary for

25

a fair trial.

The first, of course, is that --

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but what if --

2

just to take an example, let's suppose there are two

3

possible defenses you could raise, entrapment and that

4

you didn't do it.

5

entrapment and the other wants to, you know -- the one

6

that you want is the one who said we'll argue you

7

didn't do it.

8

present the defense along the lines you want presented

9

as opposed to having to take another lawyer that is

10
11

And one lawyer wants to argue

Don't you have a right to have a lawyer

different than your choice?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, within limits, I think

12

that that's certainly true, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

course, this case and many of the cases that raise this

14

issue do not involve a situation in which the defendant

15

is deprived of retained counsel with whom he can

16

consult and whose strategic decisions he can control

17

through his role as the client.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But, of

Well, that was my -- even

19

in the Chief Justice's hypothetical, I -- I take it the

20

client has a right to direct the attorney what defense

21

to present, or am I wrong about it?

22

MR. DREEBEN:

I think within limits, that's

23

absolutely right, Justice Kennedy.

24

counsel of choice, as this Court has articulated it in

25

its Wheat decision, is far from an absolute right.

And the right of

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

It's a qualified right that does yield to interests

2

that are designed to protect the fairness of the trial.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in this -- in this

4

case, Mr. Dreeben, we have a defendant ready, willing,

5

and able to pay for an experienced lawyer in whom he

6

has great trust.

7

rather inexperienced lawyer, and he says, that doesn't

8

fit within my Sixth Amendment right.

9

choose the counsel that I want and not the one that the

10
11

He's instead stuck with a younger,

I have a right to

court forces on me.
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think

12

it's critical in this case that it -- the court never

13

forced a lawyer on Respondent in this case.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it was a junior

15

counsel. As I understand it, the counsel that

16

represented him finally, when the judge wrongfully

17

refused to allow his chosen counsel to proceed, was one

18

chosen as a junior by the more senior counsel, the one

19

that defendant wanted.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

And the Respondent had months

21

after that disqualification was made clear and the

22

court of appeals denied mandamus to retain a different

23

counsel if he chose to retain a different counsel.

24

There's no showing in this record that the Respondent

25

didn't consult with the lawyer who was disqualified and

8

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

with the lawyer who he elected to have represent him at

2

trial and not determine that that was in his best

3

interest at that time.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

-- from his first choice.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9

So he was just disabled from

He was disabled -The court told him you can't

have the counsel you want.
MR. DREEBEN:

Go find somebody else.

That's right, and that's why we

10

are not disagreeing in this case that there's been an

11

infringement of his constitutionally protected interest

12

in having counsel of choice.

13

But the question for this Court is how should

14

that be defined as a denial of a Sixth Amendment right.

15
16
17

Should it be something that is automatically
reversible so that even if Respondent had -JUSTICE STEVENS:

How do you reconcile your

18

position with the right to self-representation, if

19

somebody doesn't want a lawyer at all?

20

the judge insists on him taking a lawyer, that could be

21

reversible error.

22
23
24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

And I guess if

This Court has made clear that

the right to self-representation is unique.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is even a greater right

than the right to pick your own lawyer.

Isn't that a -- an element of autonomy?

MR. DREEBEN:

There's a modest element of

11

autonomy in the right of counsel of choice, but the

12

right of self-representation is complete autonomy.

13

There is no substitute for the individual defendant's

14

voice in the courtroom.

15

that could give him that right.

16

There is no representative

And this Court has also recognized that the

17

right to self-representation is usually a right that

18

redounds negatively for the defendant.

19

produce worse trial outcomes for the defendant.

20

recognition of the autonomy as independent of fair

21

trial interests that are protected by the right of

22

self-representation, this Court has placed it in that

23

very small group of rights in which automatic reversal

24

is appropriate.

Government's position be?

could obtain relief.

the Flanagan decision that there's no automatic right

of interlocutory review from the denial of counsel of

fact that either the right could be vindicated at the

19

end of the trial or it's not totally separable from the

merits.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

seem to me that there would be no need for the

14

extraordinary proceeding.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

The Government doesn't dispute

16

that as in this -- as this Court held in Wheat, there's

17

a presumption in favor of counsel of choice.

court has rules that govern how lawyers are to enter

19

their appearances and represent defendants, and

20

district courts can make --

Every

Would you say that

22

presumption is sufficient so that mandate should be

entertained by a court of appeals anytime this question

MR. DREEBEN:

Not anytime, Justice Kennedy.

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

I think that would effectively overturn this Court's

2

holding in Flanagan, that there's no right of taking a

3

collateral order appeal in every single case involving

4

the disqualification of counsel.

5

But what's critical here, I think, is to

6

compare the position of a defendant who has no counsel

7

at all, the position of a defendant who has counsel

8

who's laboring under a conflict of interest, the

9

position of a defendant who has a counsel who's not

10

performing competently, who's making professionally

11

unreasonable decisions.

12

instances has this Court held that automatic reversal

13

without any showing of prejudice at all is warranted.

14

Only in the first of those

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did Flanagan, the case that

15

denied mandamus on this issue -- did it assume any

16

resolution of the question whether if -- if you can't

17

have counsel of your choice, in order to get your

18

conviction reversed, you have to show -- you have to

19

show that the error was not harmless?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Scalia, Flanagan held

21

that there was no collateral order appeal.

address the mandamus question.

think that it's relevant to the question of whether you

2

allow immediate appeal, what the consequences of not

allowing immediate appeal are.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

What this Court said in

7

Flanagan is that if the defendant, at the end of the

8

day -- and if was the operative word -- could obtain

9

automatic reversal, then the defendant's interests

10

could be vindicated at the end of trial.

11

alternatively, the defendant had to establish

12

prejudice, then the interlocutory appeal would fail the

13

requirement that the issue be totally separate from the

14

merits, and therefore, there was no collateral order

15

appeal.

16

And if,

And Flanagan didn't address this issue, but

17

in addressing it, I suggest that this Court should look

18

at the way that it has protected other criminal

19

defendants' rights under the Sixth Amendment.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Dreeben, did I

21

understand your brief to suggest that the -- I

22

understand your main burden is to overturn the idea of

23

automatic reversal.

MR. DREEBEN:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct.

Our -- our standard of

prejudice, our preferred standard of prejudice, is the

same as under Strickland.

defendant to show that his second-choice retained

7

counsel performed incompetently.

8

retained counsel can perform fully competently and have

made a significantly different strategic course of

We would not require the

Second-choice

10

action than the counsel who actually went to trial, and

11

that could easily be established by having an affidavit

or testimony submitted.

13

conducting a Strickland inquiry because in Strickland,

14

you're looking at the way counsel performed and your

hypothesizing how a competent counsel would perform.

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's actually easier than

Well, why would it be easier

17

than in Strickland?

19

focused inquiry, but in this situation, how are you

going to -- how can a judge assess, after the fact,

whether the strategy that was pursued was inferior to

22

another strategy that's -- that -- that allegedly would

representing the defendant was in some way less

2

skillful than the attorney that the -- the defendant

preferred to have?

4

determination to make.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

That seems like a very difficult

Justice Alito, I don't think

6

that it is that difficult.

7

easier than Strickland because in Strickland, you have

8

to look at one lawyer and decide whether his

9

performance was not competent and then hypothesize what

I think, in fact, it's

10

a competent lawyer would have done, and then conduct

11

the counter-factual inquiry of how it would have

12

affected the trial.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but isn't it almost

14

essential, in one of these inquiries, to -- to invade

15

the attorney-client privilege over and over again to

16

find out what they might have done with a different

17

lawyer?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

This almost invariably occurs

19

in every Strickland case.

20

submission here is that a defendant who is saddled with

21

a lawyer who performs in an unprofessionally

22

incompetent manner cannot overturn his conviction

23

without --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -- I don't want -- I

I would not consider the Twinkie defense an invention

to let them in.

criterion for winning is not how competent is the

lawyer necessarily.

14

I want to win.

MR. DREEBEN:

will make different strategic judgments and assessing

the impact of those on the trial --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, in -- in hindsight,

19

you've always made a mistake if your client is found

20

guilty.

21

I -- I'm just not sure how this inquiry would

22

proceed.

23

automatic reversal on one -- on one hand, or the other

24

rule ought to be incompetency of counsel.

remedy.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the -- the remedy that --

that this Court has chosen when counsel is not

competent requires I think a -- a systematic inquiry.

I wouldn't call it entirely speculative.

8

had counsel performed differently.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's a

The only issue in that case

10

is competent performance, and it seems to me that the

11

-- the difficulty behind a number of our questions this

12

morning is that you are trying to draw an analogy from

13

-- from counsel issues that don't involve an autonomy

14

interest to a counsel issue that does involve an

15

autonomy interest, maybe in theory not as greatly as

16

self-representation, but as -- as everybody agrees, as

17

you've said, it involves some autonomy interest.

18

if we're going to import the rule of prejudice from

19

non-autonomy cases as the -- as the necessary condition

20

in autonomy cases, then it seems to me the autonomy

21

interest is devalued to the point of almost of

22

disappearance.

23

little bit, but not much more than an ineffective

24

assistance case.

25

And

It becomes not much more than -- a

1

considerably more than an ineffective assistance case.

2

And the autonomy interest that's being protected here

3

needs to be viewed in relation to the fact that the

4

defendant can still retain his counsel.

5

he's denied all choice of counsel.

6

first-choice counsel which --

Sure, no harm, no foul.

But that can't be the -- that can't be the criterion

7

for a court and that can't be our criterion in deciding

8

whether he really has a right to his first choice or

9

not.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Souter, I think what it

11

illustrates is that the right to choose counsel is

12

connected with the desirability, as Justice Scalia

13

pointed out, of a favorable outcome.

14

complete --

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And it is not

It's -- it's basically -- in

outcome by using the lawyer he wants.

judgment about what will probably be a favorable

20

outcome, and his judgment about the lawyer who is most

21

likely to bring that about.

MR. DREEBEN:

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, and I'm not suggesting

that the Court apply the criteria in Strickland.

3

this Court has a variety of other standards that it could

4

choose if it concluded that the Eighth Circuit's rule

5

of automatic reversal provides an unjustified windfall

6

for a defendant when it's considered that defendants

who -- this would basically be equating the right of

counsel of choice, which is available only to about 10

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm saying that they have it,

19

but in order for this Court to conclude that reversal

20

of a trial that can be presumed fundamentally fair,

21

because the defendant, in fact, went to trial with

22

counsel who he had chosen, albeit as his second choice,

23

should not occur with all of the societal impacts that

24

that has, the potential for victims to have to go

And that is

why this Court, in construing this right, in the

4

context of what I think is probably the most critical

5

aspect of the right, once you have a lawyer in the

criminal justice system, namely the right to the

to the impact on the fairness of the trial.

24

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think that's accurate,

Justice Scalia, because what the Court made clear in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

its self-representation cases is that there was an

2

important historical tradition that was being

3

protected, and it's being protected independent of the

4

defendant's interest in a successful outcome.

5

allowing the defendant to speak to the jury in his own

6

voice because there's something deemed fundamentally

7

unfair about a system in which a defendant needs to go

8

to prison without ever having been able to speak in his

9

own voice to a courtroom.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's

Why is there a less worthy

11

historical tradition to be honored in a defendant's

2

not a right that proceeds in connection with the

fairness of the trial.

5

Its -- its sole existence is --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

he -- I mean, the -- the whole point here isn't the --

7

isn't the interest in autonomy a separate interest

8

which should be recognized by some means other than

9

merely looking to the fairness of the trial.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that it is a right that

11

should be -- an interest that should be recognized, and

12

it is, of course, recognized in Wheat by saying that

13

it's comprehended within the Sixth Amendment.

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, I think the

2

Court has before it three options for some standard

3

that would not consist of an automatic reversal

4

standard.

5

The first, and the Government's preferred

6

position, is that the defendant should come in and show

7

what counsel of first choice would have done as a

8

matter of strategy and show that if he had pursued

9

that, it would create a reasonable probability of a

10

different outcome, the same test as in Strickland.

11
12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

Does different outcome

More favorable --- if the defendant is

found guilty, he would have been acquitted?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

17

test as in Strickland.

18

more likely than not the defendant would have been

19

acquitted, but it undermines confidence in the outcome.

20
21
22

That's right.

The same -- same

It doesn't require proof that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How do you think that would

work with the Twinkie defense?
MR. DREEBEN:

I think, Justice Scalia, you'd

23

have to actually look at the specific facts of the case

24

and make a determination.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think any court

27
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

would conceivably reverse the -- the disqualification

2

of counsel on the ground that he would have come up

3

with that defense and win.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

And if that's because any court

5

would conclude that that defense was not likely to

6

prevail, then I would submit that the proper

7

accommodation of the societal interest in respecting a

8

final judgment and protecting the interest -- the

9

qualified interest in counsel of choice is properly

10

resolved.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

Let me ask -You said you had -- you

said you had -- your first preference would be --

14

MR. DREEBEN:

-- different strategy and

16

would have been acquitted with that strategy.

17

your other --

18

MR. DREEBEN:

What's

The second option would be the

19

standard that the Seventh Circuit selected in Rodriguez

20

v. Chandler, which requires a showing that the second-

21

choice lawyer was deficient in some important

22

qualification or would -- pursued a different strategic

23

interest and a different strategic approach than first-

24

choice counsel, and that's it.

25

Court's conflicts jurisprudence where, when there is

More analogous to this

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

simultaneous multiple representation, it's sufficient

2

for the defendant to show a different strategic

3

approach that was not taken because the conflict caused

4

the -- the lawyer not to do that, and there's no

5

requirement of outcome determinativeness that goes

6

along with that.

7

And the third alternative would simply be to

8

provide a harmless error standard, instead of deeming

9

this to be structural error, equating it with a biased

10

judge, total denial of counsel, racial discrimination

11

in the grand jury.

12

in which it's the Government's burden to show that the

13

error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, which in

14

cases of overwhelming evidence, the Government could

15

establish.

16

This Court could provide a standard

And although, I acknowledge, Justice Souter,

17

that the autonomy interest would be, to a certain

18

extent, lost in that instance, there are many rights,

19

many interests that are sacrificed and not deemed

20

remediable when the error is found harmless.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't the sacrifice sort

22

of egregious here?

23

representation, we give virtually absolute respect to

24

it, knowing perfectly well that the decision to

25

represent one's self is usually crazy.

Because in the case of self-

this case, when the decision may very well be sound, we

2

give -- we would, on your view, give a -- a much

3

reduced respect to it.

That does not seem consistent.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Souter, I -- I do want

5

to reserve the remainder of my time, but the point is

6

that a defendant who has his second-choice opportunity

7

of counsel is able to express his autonomy interests in

a much more significant way than a defendant who is

body of jurisprudence, beginning with Powell against

discretion in denying a continuance, for example, to

10

choice.

11

we found it when we showed up today because here, it's

able to proceed with the defendant -- I'm sorry -- with

15

As I said, we're not asking to change the

status quo in any respect here because here it's

anything differently.

conviction in that case.

2

MR. FISHER:

Well, it seems -- you know,

3

perhaps we could imagine a scenario, Mr. Chief Justice,

4

where the defendant effectively waives his right, and

5

if he came out and said so much to the court.

6

certainly it is our position that if he's denied the

7

first-choice counsel against his wishes and without any

8

legitimate justification, a Sixth Amendment violation

9

occurs right then and there.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

And -- and if -- if

11

he were not able to afford a -- afford an attorney and

12

one were appointed for him and that lawyer were

13

incompetent, that client would still have to show

14

prejudice.

15

anything at all.

16

But in your case, you don't have to show

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

And that goes to

17

the heart of the kind of right that we're talking about

18

today, and this is the critical difference between the

19

counsel of choice right and the Strickland right.

20

the difference is in -- in the counsel of choice right,

21

the Government has affirmatively acted to interfere

22

with the way the defendant wants to conduct his defense

23

and has every right to conduct his defense --

24

relying on appointed counsel have the same right?

The

--

6

7

MR. FISHER:

Why not?

-- the defendant who has counsel

8

of his -- who's -- who's appointed counsel does have a

9

limited right to control certain fundamental decisions

10

in his defense such as whether he testifies, whether he

11

accepts a plea offer.

12

that resides in the defendant who has appointed

13

counsel.

So there is even some autonomy

14

But the critical distinction --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think he can also

16

reject an appointed counsel.

17

and say, I -- you know, I don't like this counsel?

19

MR. FISHER:

Can't he go to the court

Certainly that happens, Justice

Scalia.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. FISHER:

You know, there are -- there are

be asking too much of the court --

MR. FISHER:

Well, this Court -- I mean, in

11

numerous areas of this Court's jurisprudence, not just

12

in criminal procedure, this Court recognizes that there

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in --

How many lawyers --

you're talking about a very refined assertion of a

constitutional right.

5

hundreds of thousands of lawyers, and what you're

6

saying is that if he doesn't get choice one, choice two

is just not going to do, no matter how close, no matter

8

how similar their approaches are going to be.

9

like he's, you know, wants a Rolls Royce and he gets a

I mean there are hundreds and

It's not

11

12

hundreds of thousands.

13

MR. FISHER:

He could

In some cases, that's true, Mr.

14

Chief Justice, although I would hasten to -- to tell

15

you that even in the context of defendants who can

16

retain counsel, very often, if their retained counsel

17

is disqualified, they're forced, as in this case --

18

they're simply out of money and have to go forward with

19

local counsel.

20

sure that's right.

21

So as practical terms, I'm not quite

But, yes, we are talking about a small

22

universe of people, but it's an important universe of

23

people.

24

this is how I want to conduct my defense.

talking about the self-representation right, this Court

the message in -- in a criminal defendant's case.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, can there not be a case

4

where it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the --

5

the judge's mistaken ruling on a disqualification

6

motion didn't have any effect on the outcome?

7

MR. FISHER:

I think only in the case of an

8

acquittal.

9

we don't have an appeal.

10

And -- and there -- and there, of course,
But, Justice Alito, I think

this goes back --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FISHER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why not?

-- to the Twinkie -Well, why not in the

case of an acquittal?

16

you have a 1983 action.

17

constitutional rights have been violated because,

18

although you won, you didn't win with the counsel of

your choice.

20

interests have been quashed.

21

There's still a violation of the

Maybe you don't have an appeal, but
Right?

Because your

And if -- your personal autonomy

MR. FISHER:

I think you'd have a

22

constitutional violation, but it would, in fact, be

23

harmless, and I don't think you'd have a 1983 action

24

because --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It wouldn't be

Washington, DC 20005

1

harmless under your theory because your theory is that

2

this is giving expression to your personal autonomy.

3

It's not simply for your defense.

4

it would say that it's totally wrapped up in the

5

defense.

6

under your theory.

7

If it were harmless,

But there's another constitutional interest

MR. FISHER:

Okay.

Well, I -- I think what

8

I'll say is then we have an immunity problem with

9

bringing the 1983 case.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let's say the defendant

11

wanted to be represented by a relative whose -- whose

12

specialty is real estate, and for some reason, that

13

lawyer is wrongfully disqualified.

14

defendant ends up with a very experienced criminal

15

practitioner with a national representation -- a

16

national reputation, and still the defendant is

17

convicted.

18

reasonable doubt?

19

And so then the

Could that not be harmless beyond a

MR. FISHER:

Let me say two things to that,

20

Justice Alito.

21

hypotheticals in the United States' brief.

22

we're not aware of that situation ever having occurred.

23
24
25

The first is that's akin to the
We've --

But if it did, yes, you would have a violation.
And it's important to separate the right from
the remedy here.

We would unquestionably have a Sixth

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

Amendment violation when the trial court, for no

2

legitimate reason, said, you cannot go forward with the

3

counsel of choice.

4

you're framing is whether we'd have a Chapman case there.

5

Now, the only question I think

But this just brings up, Justice Scalia's Twinkie

6

case, and to take away --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or -- or my Uncle Vinnie.

8

What about the real -- the real case of my Uncle

9

Vinnie?

There's --

10

MR. FISHER:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

Well -I don't know -- I don't know

whether he was a real estate lawyer or not.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. FISHER:

Well, I'll try to do even better

15

than Uncle Vinnie, and say in our brief we talk about a

16

case, the Euel Lee case, which is a case where a black

17

defendant wanted to go forward with his counsel of

18

choice in -- in the District of Maryland, and he was

19

forced to go ahead with a more experienced,

20

establishment-type counsel and -- and to his detriment.

21

So -- so we proceed at our peril where we say that the

22

defendant doesn't have the right to decide what's best

23

for him.

24
25

The core right, which this Court recognized
in Wheat -- we would submit to the Court that this

39
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Court saying in Wheat there's a presumption that the

2

defendants have the right to proceed with counsel of

3

choice really can't be explained in any other way than

4

saying that the right -- the Sixth Amendment right here

5

goes beyond simply a fair trial and does encompass an

6

autonomy interest.

7

interest within the Sixth Amendment the way that Wheat

8

does is simply to say that the right to counsel of

9

choice is like any number of other Sixth Amendment

And to conceptualize that autonomy

10

rights, which is to say, trial judges have the power to

11

curtail it or qualify it when they have legitimate

12

reasons for things like the integrity of the courts,

13

for things like the efficiency of the docket, Justice

14

Kennedy, and lots of other things.

15

The same is true of self-representation.

A

16

defendant does not have an unqualified right to self-

17

representation.

concerns --

25

A defendant can be forced to have
The defendant can even have his right

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the same kinds of

Well, but -- but this is

all subject challenge as an abuse of discretion.
MR. FISHER:

That's right.

And there is --

the United States raises in its brief the -- the

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

supposed danger that courts and prosecutors will be too

2

hesitant to challenge selected counsel of choice, but

3

you've already taken that fully in consideration in

4

your Wheat decision.

5

Wheat decision is to say these are decisions that have

6

to be made at the outset of trial.

7

we're going to give trial judges substantial latitude

8

and broad discretion to decide when -- when the

9

defendant has to accept a different lawyer.

10

I mean, that's the basis for this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so, therefore,

Counsel, I suppose

11

this -- this right applies on appeal as well.

12

Somebody says, I want Mr. Fisher to argue my case in

13

the Supreme Court.

14

and yet -- and we get motions for admission to our bar

15

pro hac vice.

16

violate the Sixth Amendment?

17

I don't want anybody else.

Right?

And --

If we deny one of those, does that

MR. FISHER:

Well, it's not contested in this

18

case that the -- that the pro hac vice denial did

19

violate the Sixth Amendment.

20

isn't something you have to deal with in this case.

So I'm not sure -- this

21

But, yes, this would be a right that would --

22

that would go forward on appeal, provided the defendant

23

walked into court and said this is the person who I

24

want to go forward with me, and the court, under its

25

rules and practices and in the substantial discretion

41
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that court has in Wheat, if the trial court simply went

2

-- if the court simply went off the reservation and

3

said, no, you can't have this person for no reason,

4

there would be.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

-- trial is -- is one thing.

7

would do the appeal over?

8

argument over?

9

counsel of choice?

10

Are you saying that this
Appeal -- but you say he

He'd do the appellate

Do the petition for cert over with
There's a different stage involved.

MR. FISHER:

It might, Justice Ginsburg.

11

to be frank with you, I haven't thought all the way

12

through the consequences --

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Are you entitled to

represent yourself on appeal?

15

MR. FISHER:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. FISHER:

No, you're not.
So --

So there is a difference, of

18

course, this Court has recognized in its Martinez case,

19

that takes place.

20

But to bring the point home, in -- in Wheat,

21

simply saying that the defendant has the right to

22

counsel of choice unless the trial court has a good

23

reason for saying no, would make this right just like

24

lots of other rights in the Sixth Amendment, the right

25

to self-representation, the right to cross-examination,

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

all the other rights in the Sixth Amendment that can

2

give way for efficiency or integrity concerns.

3

But what the United States is suggesting is

4

something radically different that we submit doesn't

5

exist anywhere else in constitutional law, which is to

6

say that this Court recognizes that a certain right

7

exists, but when it's arbitrarily denied, the defendant

8

simply has no remedy unless he can affirmatively show

9

his own prejudice.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That -- that happens

11

all the time.

12

of incompetent counsel.

13

competent counsel.

14

violated, the defendant still has to show prejudice --

That happens, for example, in the case
There's a right to -- to

If you -- if that right is

15

MR. FISHER:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

It --- before he'll get

relief.

18

MR. FISHER:

19

The critical difference between this and the

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

right to effective assistance of counsel is the

21

affirmative action by the court.

22

itself at page 686, this Court recognized the Geders --

23

the Geders decision, the Brooks decision, the Herring

24

decision, which are all accepted by the Solicitor

25

General in footnote 3 of its brief.

And in Strickland

And the core

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

holding of those cases is when the court interferes

2

with what the defendant wants to do, then a Sixth

3

Amendment violation takes place right then and there,

4

and we don't look at all to whether prejudice took

5

place.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you -- are you relying

7

at all on the effect that you want the Court's decision

8

to have on trial judges and prosecutors, that is, a

9

judge who knows if he disqualifies a lawyer who

10

shouldn't be disqualified, that there will be an

11

automatic new trial?

12

by -- by the way, what did the prosecutor -- did the

13

prosecutor take the position in this case when the

14

judge says, I don't want that lawyer to be in my

15

courtroom?

And the prosecutor who's standing

16

MR. FISHER:

17

facts and on the law.

18

was a pretrial sanction hearing in which the prosecutor

19

showed up unannounced to the defense and actually

20

submitted witnesses and evidence to support the

21

disqualification of Mr. Low.

22

did play a part and support the disqualification in

23

this case.

24
25

Let me answer it both on the
On the facts of this case, there

So, yes, the prosecutor

Now, to answer your question on the law and
the practicalities, we're here today defending the

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

status quo because the rule in every Federal circuit is

2

that on direct appeal if the right to counsel of choice

3

is denied, it's an automatic reversal.

4

we're relying on the practicalities of how things work

5

in the lower courts only to the extent to say it's

6

working fine just now, and this Court ought not to

7

upset that.

8

fewer than one case a year in the Federal courts of

9

appeals where a scenario as rare as this arises.

So we're --

Right now, by our count, you get probably

And

10

so we think that this Court's incentives, which are put

11

in place by the Wheat case, as I was talking about, get

12

it just right.

13

little bit of hesitance, but on the other hand, trial

14

judges have substantial discretion in making these

15

threshold decisions.

16

They get it so that, yes, there's a

And so we submit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there cases in the

17

records where it shows government overreaching or bad

18

faith and so forth in trying to get rid of the counsel?

19

That just doesn't happen?

20

MR. FISHER:

I'm not aware of any case,

21

Justice Kennedy, where an express finding of bad faith

22

is placed on the record.

23

points out one of the -- one of the things about this

24

kind of case is that we just have a record in many

25

ways.

But -- but, of course, that

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

What the United States is suggesting is that

2

we should have these satellite collateral proceedings

3

where we have to not just investigate questions like

4

that perhaps, but also recreate an entire trial.

5

this is much more difficult than the Strickland

6

scenario because, as Justice Alito pointed out, in

7

Strickland we can at least compare the defendant -- the

8

defendant's lawyer's performance against an objective

9

-- an objective counsel.

And

And even -- and it's even

10

easier than that because, because of the performance

11

prong, the first prong of the Strickland test, we

12

winnow out the decisions that lawyer made to probably

13

just two or three.

14

Strickland case, it looks at one or two decisions a

15

trial judge -- the trial counsel made.

I mean, in this Court's typical

16

In this context, we'd have to look not just

17

at an entire trial, but at the entire attorney-client

18

relationship from the moment the -- the counsel would

19

have met the defendant, all of the different decisions

20

that might have taken place in terms of investigation,

21

negotiation, strategy before trial, strategy during

22

trial.

23

choice counsel presumably to take the stand or file

24

some sort of affidavit not saying this is the strategy

25

that would have -- would have necessarily happened

And what you'd be asking is for this first-

46
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

because he didn't get to try the case.

2

you'd be asking this person to do is sort of take the

3

stand and hypothesize what he might have done in all

4

these various situations --

5
6

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. FISHER:

-- with all the problems of

hindsight.

9
10

Would your -- would your rule

--

7
8

What -- what

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would your rule apply in the

case of a guilty plea?

11

MR. FISHER:

Well, I mean, our rule would --

12

would apply in a guilty plea case, provided the

13

defendant didn't waive it, didn't waive the -- the

14

argument in his guilty plea.

15

But the problem with -- you know, to look at

16

the other side, imagine the -- the case where the

17

defendant's first-choice counsel is disqualified and he

18

does plead guilty and he wants to plead guilty, which,

19

of course, happens in over 90 percent of the criminal

20

cases in the country.

21

problem because how is that person supposed to show on

22

appeal what would have happened with his first-choice

23

lawyer?

There, we have an enormous

24

First of all, under the -- under the United

25

States conception, which conflates this -- this right

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

with Strickland, they have the problem of this Court's

2

decision in Hill against Lockhart which holds that a

3

defendant doesn't have an ineffective assistance type

4

claim unless he can show that he wouldn't have pleaded

5

guilty at all but for his counsel's advice.

6

And secondly, we have the problem, once

7

again, of just the crazy kind of predictions that we

8

have start to engage in.

9

guilty plea case, we have to put the -- the first-

We -- I suppose there in a

10

choice lawyer on the stand to testify to all the

11

various things he might have done.

12

have to put the prosecutor on the stand to say, oh,

13

would you have taken the deal if this would have taken

14

place and that would have taken place and the other

15

would have taken place.

16

Then perhaps we

And -- and what we submit is that not only is

17

-- is this fundamentally improper because once we have

18

a constitutional violation, the only -- the only

19

choices on appeal are Chapman error and structural

20

error, and all of this is outside the record.

21

would be impossible to do under Chapman.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it

Mr. Fisher, remind me in

23

bringing up the plea question.

24

reasons why this defendant wanted this particular

25

lawyer is that this lawyer made good bargains with the

I thought one of the

48
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

prosecutor.

2

Was that not so?

MR. FISHER:

That is part of the record,

3

Justice Ginsburg.

4

in this case had appeared in the very same court

5

several months before before the very same judge and

6

stepped in on the eve of trial and negotiated an

7

extremely favorable plea agreement for the defendant in

8

that case.

9

about Mr. Low and that's why he sought him out.

The lawyer that the defendant wanted

And that's how Mr. Gonzalez-Lopez learned
I

10

don't think it's a part of the record whether he wanted

11

to plead guilty or whether he wanted to go to trial.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. FISHER:

14

Some of the --

But that's certainly one of his

considerations.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Some of the concerns

16

about the evidentiary presentation were addressed by

17

the Seventh Circuit and are the reason they adopted a --

18

a lesser standard than the prejudice standard in -- in

19

Strickland.

20

concerns?

21

Why isn't that adequate to meet those

MR. FISHER:

Well, for two reasons, Mr. Chief

22

Justice.

23

respect, simply misconceived the right.

24

fundamental submission here that the right is violated

25

at the moment the trial judge impermissibly

First of all, the Seventh Circuit, with due

2

Circuit didn't understand.

3

violates the right, then your only choices, under this

4

Court's jurisprudence -- what it said in Neder was the

only two choices are structural error or a Chapman

review.

7

Once you say that that

a habeas case.

9

ability to compile an evidentiary record, but once you

10

recognize that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of

11

choice is violated at the moment of the

12

disqualification, then your only choices are Strickland

13

-- I'm sorry -- are Chapman or structural error.

14

It had an evidentiary -- it had the

The Seventh Circuit way of doing things,

15

which the United States to some degree embraces, of

16

having an evidentiary hearing on collateral review

17

proves the point why we can't say this is subject to

18

harmless error review because we don't have the stuff

19

in the record that we need.

20

Seventh Circuit didn't -- didn't -- first of all, it

21

wasn't speaking to it because, of course, it was

22

deciding a habeas case.

23

And that's what the

But it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What are the -- what are

24

the practicalities or impracticalities, as the case may

25

be, of seeking immediate review from the court of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

appeals by writ of mandate?

2

MR. FISHER:

Oh, well, there's -- there's two

3

big problems with what the -- with the United States'

4

position on that point, Justice Kennedy.

5

I -- I think as -- as came out, if mandamus became too

6

common, it would effectively overrule this Court's

7

Flanagan decision.

8
9

The first is,

But there's an even more fundamental problem,
which is to say that mandamus is only available when a

10

defendant can show a clear violation of a right.

11

the way the United States conceives the right, there's

12

no violation of the right until you haven't received a

13

fair trial.

14

on mandamus and saying, my right to counsel of choice

15

has been violated.

16

would be, well, we can't decide that.

17

know whether it's been violated until we see the record

18

that develops in this case and the defense that your --

19

that your replacement counsel puts on.

20

Now,

So imagine the defendant going up pretrial

I think it would be easy

21

for us to make a distinction between the right and the

22

remedy.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm -- I'm not sure you're

24

properly characterizing the -- the Government's

25

position.

I mean, you -- you don't have to assert that

51
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the right is not violated until -- until there's an

2

unfair trial in order to take the position that the

3

Government takes.

4

that are later reviewed for harmless error or for -- to

5

see whether there was prejudice were violated at the

6

time, and not -- not just on the basis of whether there

7

was prejudice or not.

8

MR. FISHER:

9

I mean, the right -- a lot of rights

Justice Scalia, I think I'm

fairly characterizing the Government's position when I

10

say that as a constitutional matter, they say there's

11

no Sixth Amendment violation until we see what happens

12

at the trial.

13
14
15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought they said there

isn't if the question is remedied.
MR. FISHER:

I don't think that's the way

16

that they're presenting their case, Justice Ginsburg,

17

and this is important because what the Government is

18

saying is the right itself is not violated until we

19

have a breakdown in the adversarial process at trial.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but in all events, we

21

could structure the decision to make -- to make sense,

22

and if these instances happen, as you indicate in your

23

brief, very early, it seems to me that the answer is

24

mandate in a court of appeals.

25

MR. FISHER:

Well, you -- if you conceived

52
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the right as one that you made clear there's a

2

violation at the moment the trial court impermissibly

3

denies counsel of choice, and then perhaps to say --

4

and then you went on to say there's either an automatic

5

reversal rule or even a Chapman standard, then you

6

could say that there would be a right for mandamus on

7

appeal.

8

Flanagan.

9
10
11

But then you run into the same problem of

And then -- but if you didn't do that and he
said what the United States -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but then you

12

wouldn't -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.

13

point, the defendant would be well advised to go ahead

14

with trial with his second-choice lawyer.

15

MR. FISHER:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17
18

But at that

Right?

He may well be.
Take his chance and

then if he -- if he loses, he gets automatic reversal.
So why would he do mandamus?

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

MR. FISHER:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right.

Well, because -Unless you compel him to

22

seek mandamus on pain of losing the constitutional

23

claim, your -- every incentive is to go right ahead

24

with the trial.

25

MR. FISHER:

I think in the ordinary case,

53
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

yes, but let me talk about -- let me go back to the

2

facts of this case.

with only very limited funds.

4

only have enough money to pay one lawyer for one trial,

5

and -- and I don't want to depend on this lawyer's good

6

will or something.

7

line to -- to hypotheticals.

8
9

I mean, we have a defendant here
He may decide that I

I mean, so we're getting down the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think the mandamus

solution works unless you compel mandamus, unless you

10

say you lose -- you lose the claim unless you bring

11

mandamus.

12
13
14

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

I mean, I think I'll

accept that mandamus doesn't work.
And Justice Kennedy, even on -- even on this

15

record, if you look at the rule of the Eastern District

16

of Missouri for -- for pro hac vice admission, it's

17

entirely discretionary on its face.

18

to imagine what your mandamus argument would be.

19

of course, here the Eighth Circuit just issued a one-

20

word dismissal.

21

And so it's hard
And,

So it's our position that for -- not only for

22

the legal reasons of the historical grounding of -- of

23

the right to counsel of choice and the logical reasons

24

with the differences between the government interfering

25

with what the defendant wants to do versus the

situation that we have in Strickland where this Court

2

has said that even if -- if the government doesn't do

3

anything at all -- and this Court emphasized in

4

Strickland that -- another difference between

5

Strickland and this case is the -- is that the

6

government is powerless in the Strickland scenario to

7

prevent -- to prevent the constitutional violation.

8

we have the difference here of the government acting to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In the government,

you're including the court in that.

I'm sorry.

When I say the

government, I mean the court or a prosecutor.

That's not always

true in a Strickland case.

objected to and was incompetent in not doing so.

18

When

MR. FISHER:

It's often the court that's

Well, but then those sorts of

19

mistakes aren't necessarily a Sixth Amendment right to

20

counsel arguments, I don't think, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

Those might be different kinds of mistakes.

22

But here, what we're talking about is the

23

court interfering with the right -- the Sixth Amendment

24

right the defendant has.

JUSTICE ALITO:

The

Well, your comment about the

defendant running out of a funds is -- raises a good

10

point.

11

a case like that where the defendant would be

12

represented by appointed counsel?

So the remedy would be an automatic reversal in

13

MR. FISHER:

What we have in -- what we have

14

in this case is a lawyer who was retained and who's --

15

who is willing to go forward under that retainer and in

16

a pro bono sense.

Court's --

So -- so, I mean, even under this

MR. FISHER:

In this case.

in this case.

jurisprudence, Justice Alito, you're right.

22

defendant sometimes may not be able to be put all the

23

way back into the position he -- he would have been.

24

But here, we submit that the lower court's

rule of -- of automatic reversal is the proper rule.

It's the one that's working, and it's the one this

Court should -- should refuse to change today.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How many -- how many

4

circuits are applying that rule?

5

MR. FISHER:

It's roughly -- roughly half the

6

circuits have addressed this issue on direct appeal,

7

and they've all said this is structural error, Justice

8

Scalia.

If there are no further questions, I'll

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Fisher.
Mr. Dreeben, you have 2 minutes remaining.

14

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MR. DREEBEN:

17

Respondent's submission in the Eighth

18

Circuit's holding in this case is fundamentally

19

anomalous in two respects.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

The first is that it is anomalous when

21

compared to the other rights that this Court has

22

acknowledged protection of under the Sixth Amendment

23

because it accords to a defendant who had the full

24

opportunity to select his counsel and to select a

25

backup counsel the same remedy as a defendant who had

57
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

no lawyer at all.
And it's anomalous factually because a

3

defendant who is deprived of his first-choice counsel

4

may have selected that counsel improvidently, may

5

select his second-choice counsel with much greater

6

care, may obtain a lawyer who is far more competent and

7

far more effective, and all of those things have to be

8

discarded on Respondent's view and the Eighth Circuit's

9

holding and automatic reversal ordered, forcing society

10

to bear the costs of a retrial even when there is no

11

reasonable probability or it is a beyond a reasonable

12

doubt that no lawyer could have made a difference.

13

And the proper accommodation of the values

14

that are at stake in this case is to recognize that

15

some form of prejudice inquiry is appropriate before

16

this Court imposes on the judicial system the extreme

17

consequence of automatic reversal.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, Mr. Dreeben, do you

19

agree with his characterization that all the courts of

20

appeals go the other way?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

The Seventh Circuit made

22

perfectly clear in the Rodriguez case that it was

23

rejecting on the merits the view that automatic

24

reversal is warranted.

25

reversal is warranted largely arose from a

And the view that automatic

58
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

misunderstanding of this Court's Flanagan decision in

2

which dictum was quoted as if it were a holding and

3

because the courts failed to triangulate the right in

4

question here with the right that this Court has

5

recognized in the ineffectiveness context and in the

6

conflicts context.

7

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The case is submitted.
