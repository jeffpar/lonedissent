ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. HURD:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

10

As Congress recently reaffirmed, the IDEA was

11

enacted to protect the rights of children with

12

disabilities, and the rights of their parents.

13

Act intended by Congress to remedy a long history of

14

discrimination that once kept these children from the

15

schoolhouse door.

16

said in Rowley, to maximize parental involvement and to

17

ensure that these children have access to an appropriate

18

education.

19

It is an

It is an Act intended, as this Court

Today, the intent of Congress, as shown by the

20

text, structure, and purposes of the Act, calls for the

21

burden of proof in administrative hearings to be placed on

22

the school system, not on the parent.

23

The Fourth Circuit said that placing the burden

24

on the party who initiates proceeding is the traditional

25

rule.

But, there is no single traditional rule.

Instead,

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there is a collection of different rules.

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

3

Now, Congress was silent on

this subject of the burden of proof, was it not?

4

MR. HURD:

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, it was, Justice O'Connor.
Was there -- did you find

6

anything in the legislative history -- I know some members

7

don't care to look at that, but I would be willing --

8

[Laughter.]

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

10
11

-- that shows any discussion

at all about the burden-of-proof question?
MR. HURD:

We are aware of none, Your Honor.

12

What we -- what we have here is a situation where

13

Congress, when it wishes to allocate the burden of proof

14

one way or the other legislatively, knows how to do so.

15

It did so in the APA, for example, while adopting the rule

16

that the Fourth Circuit said applies in this case.

17

Congress did not adopt the rule in this case.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

19

-- why wasn't the APA applicable?

20

MR. HURD:

21

But

Why didn't it?

I

Well, Your Honor, the APA governs

Federal agencies, it doesn't --

MR. HURD:

Act, by the way?

You know --

6

MR. HURD:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

Your Honor, there are --

MR. HURD:

10

-- DOD schools --

JUSTICE SCALIA:
with them?

MR. HURD:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. HURD:

16
17

DOD schools.

What do you do

Are they governed by the APA?

12

15

-- military schools on military

--

9

11

Are they covered by this

We don't believe so, Your Honor.
No?

They are not.

And part of the reason

for that has to do with this unique structure of the Act.
It is a very nontraditional statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is --

Well, you'd be suing some

18

Federal agency.

19

that's running that school, and at least for that kind of

20

a school the burden is clearly going to be on the person

21

challenging the agency action.

22

I mean, it has to be some Federal agency

MR. HURD:

I don't agree, Your Honor, and let

23

me explain why, because of the unique structure of this

24

Act, it creates an equal partnership between parents and

25

the school system, with the purpose of that partnership

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

being to produce an Individualized Education Program for

2

the benefit of the child.

3

in Honig, that IEP is the centerpiece of the entire

4

statute.

5

And, as this Court recognized

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, well, what if you had

6

an IEP that the parents had initially agreed with, and

7

then they decide it isn't working well, they want to

8

challenge it.

9

They shouldn't have a burden of proof?

MR. HURD:

Your Honor, that would be a different

10

situation, and courts below have reached different results

11

on that.

12

We believe that the school system -JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, you mean the court has

13

-- every court faced with this problem is supposed to

14

decide, in that particular case, who has the

15

burden?

16

MR. HURD:

No, Your Honor.

Some courts have

17

decided that, where either party -- the school system or

18

the parents -- challenges an existing IEP or wants to

19

change an existing IEP, some courts have said the burden

20

is always on the school system, some have said the party

21

challenging has the burden.

But --

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

23

MR. HURD:

24

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

Do you --

-- in this case --- do you think it's open to

a State to adopt a general rule on who has the burden of

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

proof under this statute?

2
3

MR. HURD:

Your Honor, we think that it is not.

We believe it is a Federal question that --

4

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

5

adopt a general rule on this?

6

MR. HURD:

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

8

MR. HURD:

9

Have some States purported to

Some have, Your Honor.
And you think that's invalid?

Well, we believe -- yes, Your Honor,

we believe it is a -- it is a Federal-law question.

What

10

we do know, however, is that Maryland has adopted no rule

11

on this question, no statute to allocate the burden, one

12

way or the other.

13

adopt a rule, if it wishes to do so, that still leaves

14

open the question of what rules should apply in the

15

absence of a State-based rule.

16

And even if a State has the ability to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now -Mr. Hurd, do you recognize --

17

to narrow what's at issue -- that the parent objecting

18

to the school's IEP would at least have a burden of coming

19

forward?

20

the ultimate persuasion burden?

21

least be required to come forward with some reason to

22

believe that the State -- the school district's plan is

23

inadequate?

In other words, I -- are you speaking just of

MR. HURD:

-- I would -- Justice O'Connor, I

3

would point, for example, to your opinion in Gebser vs.

5

was not a burden-of-proof case, but, in any event, you

said the general rule must yield to the purposes of the

statute --

-- congressional intent.
-- burden-of-proof cases.

13

What is your closest one where the courts are left to do

14

this?

15

What do we look to?
MR. HURD:

Well, Your Honor, the Court, last

16

year, in Alaska versus EPA, said, there is no single rule,

17

or principle, governing the allocation of the burden.

18

in that case, this Court also said two other things that

19

are important here.

20

Government in that case, regardless of whether the

21

Government was the plaintiff or the defendant.

22

idea of burdening the party who initiates the proceedings

23

was rejected there, and this Court said it looked at the

24

purposes of the statute and saw no reason to place the

25

burden differently, depending upon whether the Government

And

One is, it put the burden on the

came to court as the plaintiff or took unilateral action

forcing the other side to come to court where the

Government would be the defendant.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand the purposes-of-

6

always to provide relief to someone who's been injured.

7

And to conclude, from this, that, therefore, the burden

8

should be on the other side, in order -- in order that

9

people who are injured can get relief, is -- I mean --

The purpose of the statute is

disabilities have available to them a free, appropriate

2

public education.

And --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. HURD:

5

Sure.

-- that purpose is served far more,

Justice Scalia --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the Federal Tort Claims

7

Act, for all I know, says, in its prologue -- or, if it

8

doesn't, it should have, or it could have -- the purpose

9

of this is to assure that every person who's been injured

10

by a -- by a Government tort obtains relief.

11

MR. HURD:

But let me, then, point out the very

12

different paradigm between the ordinary tort claim statute

13

and this statute.

14

your ordinary litigation, the law starts out by being

15

neutral with respect to the status quo.

16

reason why you have this rule -- we don't think it is

17

called "traditional rule" appropriately -- but the general

18

rule that you place the burden on the party who initiates

19

litigation is because the law is neutral with respect to

20

the status quo at the beginning of the lawsuit.

21

law is not neutral, because the status quo before the

22

hearing is: the child has no Individualized Education

23

Program.

24
25

In your ordinary tort claim statute,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

burden-of-proof issue would be of no significance, because

7

the State -- the parents would walk in, and the only thing

8

they'd have to do to satisfy "a" burden of proof would be

9

to say, "They didn't come up with an IEP."

I would understand your argument if the

Throw him into the pot with everybody

Number one, the regulations say that the

Thirdly,

10

this Court said, in Rowley, the purpose of the statute is

11

to maximize parental involvement.

12

Now, if we're equal partners at the table, what

13

sense does it make for the school system to tell the

14

parents that, "We are equal partners here, but, if you

15

disagree with me once we leave the table, I am presumed

16

correct"?

17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

What sense does it make for the

I mean --

In an -- in an equal-

partnership argument, nobody's got the burden of proof.

21

MR. HURD:

argument, nobody has the burden, because they initiated

districts talk to each other -- have a growing body of

data and expertise about IEP.

Again, it makes no

That's a well-established

principle of administrative law.

what happens with the -- if EPA normally does have a

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, you think the ALJ -- or

21

the administrative hearing officer in this case told the

22

State to go first -- the school district to go first

23

because he thought that maybe they had burden of proof,

24

and would not have asked them to go first if he didn't?

There is no general practice

would be that whoever has the burden of proof, the burden

of persuasion, would also be the one to go first and go

last.

believe it also applies here.

17

-- my point is that we are not wedded -- this Court was to

decide that the parents should go first, but the school

with us.

going to be determinative, both sides are going to have

That's the general practice in procedures.

always has the burden in order to the rule -- rule for the

parents in this case and say that, initially, when there

Burlington used that word three times, "IEP proposal,"

18

which we think implies that it was not a real IEP -- this

-- the Court need not decide the other issue in order to

decide that when there is no IEP, only a proposal, and

that it makes no sense to allocate the burden on which one

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

it please the Court:

5

Petitioners rejected the educational plan found

6

appropriate by local school officials, enrolled their

7

child in an expensive private school, and then filed a

8

due-process complaint seeking reimbursement of $21,000 in

9

private tuition expenses.

The Court of Appeals properly

10

held that petitioners bore the burden of proof in that

11

proceeding, just like --

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

it's the parents, as in this case, or the school district,

statute is where a child with a disability acts out in

that we think speak to the question, or at least -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

school district and asked for an IEP.

1

the private school suggested that they find -- the parents

2

find another environment for the child suitable for what

3

they determined to be "special needs."

contacted the local school district, and, at that point,

the school district, in conjunction with the parents,

devised an educational plan for the child.

think was acceptable and, in the interim, placed the child

11

sought reimbursement.

12

MR. GARRE:

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,

13

except that the record does show that, during the time

14

that the IEP was being developed, the parents applied for

15

the child to attend a private school and actually accepted

16

an application fee and enrolled the child in that school,

Why wouldn't it just --

Well, under the statute Congress --- just say, "The child can't

He's too disruptive," period?

MR. GARRE:

The Congress placed on school

16

districts the obligation to identify disabled children

17

within their jurisdiction.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. GARRE:

Right.

And when they have -- they believe

20

they identified such children, and they request the

21

parents to subject them to the evaluation -- Congress

22

placed on the school districts to at least conduct an

23

evaluation in that situation, and if parents disagree --

The second situation is in -- is where children

child if the school district determines that the

misbehavior is a manifestation of the child's disability.

6

The school -- the statute places

In that situation, if the -- if the school district

7

believes that more severe discipline is warranted than

8

would be allowed under the statute, the school district

9

has to initiate the hearing in order to get an ALJ to

10

allow it to take more severe action.

11

And the third situation is where the school

12

district disagrees with a parent's request for an

13

independent educational evaluation.

14

as part of the developmental process of an educational

15

plan, to have an independent educational evaluation

16

conducted on their child, paid for at public expense.

17

Most of the times, that's conducted without incidence.

some situations, if school districts believe that that

expense was not warranted, they could initiate a

proceeding.

think that this spending-clause legislation would allow a

State to adopt a higher standard than the standard that

this Court established in Rowley for free and

standard that would apply in a proceeding.

we think, with the question of the burden of proof.

States wanted to voluntarily assume the burden of proof

for their own school districts in these proceedings, which

that we're concerned about unnecessarily increasing costs

MR. GARRE:

In other words,

-- this establishes a Federal floor

You've

13

of course, there's a difference between the two.

14

was just trying to think, if I were a hearing officer, and

15

I thought, well, the issue in this case is whether the

who's the best person to tell me about it?

MR. GARRE:

Well, Justice Stevens, Congress has

answered that problem, in the sense that it requires, in

MR. GARRE:

States right now is, where, in the jurisdictions where

15

school districts bear the burden of persuasion, they are

required to go first.

17

complexity of these trials for school districts, because

18

the -- before the parents have put on their evidence as to

19

why they think an educational plan is inappropriate or is

20

-- in this case, why they think the school district hasn't

21

properly characterized their child's disability, the

22

school district has to go forward and present its case,

23

which is a more complex -- it's -- there's more guesswork

involved --

15

I mean, it is to allow a sort of doctrine from

MR. GARRE:

No, Your Honor.

We think that what

16

it is to do is to give effect to the traditional

17

presumption of regularity, which is, ultimately -- if you

18

do have a tie, whose judgment ought to be given effect?

19

And under the statute, where Congress recognized that

20

State and local governments would retain the primary

21

authority over educational decisions -- and in the Rowley

22

case, where this Court reaffirmed that -- we think that,

23

combined with the traditional presumption of regularity --

24

which is that the actions and decisions of public

25

officials are presumed to be taken in good faith, and

2

in favor of the traditional rule here.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Petitioners --

Mr. Garre, if you -- if you

4

had a situation, say, under Title 7 -- and you pointed out

5

in your brief that, in most benefit cases, most -- the

6

person -- whether it's Social Security -- the person who

7

is making the claim has the burden of proof.

8

something different about this setup, because the statute

9

does obligate the school district to come up with a plan.

But there is

10

And so, I was thinking, if you have a Title 7 case, and

11

the plaintiff prevails on the merits, and then there's a

12

question of remedy, and the employer said, "I propose this

13

-- these changes to remedy the violation," wouldn't the

14

employer in that case have the burden of establishing the

15

adequacy of the plan that it has come up with to remedy

16

the problem?

17

MR. GARRE:

I think if you're talking about an

18

affirmative defense or something beyond the threshold

19

question of whether there has been discrimination, or as

20

in a Social Security Act case question of whether an

21

eligible person has been denied the benefits --

MR. GARRE:

elements of the claim, whether there's been a violation.

I don't -- in that situation, there

12

may be -- I mean, in the same way that, in the sentencing,

13

in the criminal context, other considerations come into

14

play, it doesn't resolve it here.

Placing the burden of proof on school

17

imposition on the States, and they accept it.

18

imposition is not on the States, it's on the local school

districts.

school district is quite different from the interests of

21

the people, you know, down-State, in the State capital.

22

I'm -- I am loath to think that just because a State

supreme court says that every school district in the State

24

has to bear the burden of proof, that Congress intended

25

that to be the case.

Here, the

No, I don't think -Maryland --

-- Maryland does not.

And I

18

think, in fact, the only thing -- the only question that's

19

truly presented in this case is whether the Federal

20

statute mandates the unusual burden -- shift of placing

21

the burden on the schools in all cases.

22

clearly wasn't what Congress intended.

23

And we think that

And let me point to the provision of the

24

statute we think is the most relevant, and that is the

25

requirement that the parents -- or the complaining party

2

that traditional pleading regime requires that the -- in

3

this context, the parents come forward and identify, with

4

specificity and with supporting facts, the problem with

5

the school's educational program and how they would

6

propose to solve that problem.

7

And

And, in 2004, Congress went even further and

8

mandated that parents cannot even obtain a due-process

9

hearing until they've first complied with this due-process

10

notice requirement, and that the contents of the parents'

11

complaint will strictly define the subjects that can be

12

addressed at the hearing.

13

evidence that Congress intended the traditional allocation

14

of the burden of proof.

15

And we think that is strong

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And may I be sure I didn't

16

misunderstand something you said earlier?

17

that in most jurisdictions the -- by local option, the

MR. SALMONS:

Did you say

-- no, Your Honor, I did not.

22

What I indicated is that one of the unusual aspects of

23

these due-process hearings is that they occur very

24

infrequently, only about 5 for every 10,000 children

25

receiving educational benefits under the Act nationwide.

In certain jurisdictions, there is a very high incidence

of these hearings.

concerned about the costs that those hearings were

imposing, and were diverting funds away from the real

purposes of the Act.

point -- was that mostly -- in those jurisdictions, was it

6

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, I don't have that

information.

8

most of the jurisdictions have the burden on the schools,

9

because that's what the courts -- the Federal courts have

Most, I think, of the jurisdictions were --

10

11

reason I have a difficult time answering that is because

12

the amount of due process hearings varies so widely from

one jurisdiction to another.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. SALMONS:

What -- the

Right.

And part of that is because of the

rules and the ways in which it's been adopted.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

See, this is really a unique

18

statute in so many ways.

19

that discrimination is being treated like everybody else

20

in this -- in this statute, unusual discrimination.

21

I'm just wondering, it's -- I find it surprising and

22

significant that those who have been free to pick the

right rule have picked the rule your opponent --

I think it's -- it's most --

it's more recent than that.

And I think the explosion of

12

litigation under the Act is more recent than that.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

MR. SALMONS:

15

Right.

And Congress has been very

concerned about that.

16

Now, by requiring that the parent's due-process

17

complaint define the contours of the hearing, we think

18

Congress has signaled where the burden of proof should be.

19

And, in addition to that, it seems -- it seems to us that

20

it has addressed the policy and fairness concerns the

21

petitioners rely on so much.

22

Rowley, it's through the procedural protections of the Act

23

that Congress sought to ensure that parents had sufficient

24

information and resources to defend the interests of their

25

child.
