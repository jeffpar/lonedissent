ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The postal inspectors in this case applied

11

for a warrant to search respondent's property.

12

warrant that

13

place to be searched and the things to be seized.

14

was issued based on an affidavit that informed the

15

magistrate judge that a videotape containing child

16

pornography that respondent had ordered through the

17

mail and had paid for in cash was going to be delivered

18

to respondent's house and that the warrant would not be

19

executed until the delivery had taken place.

20

The

they obtained particularly described the
It

The Ninth Circuit held that the execution of

21

this warrant, which occurred after the delivery that

22

the postal inspectors represented would occur had in

23

fact happened, violated the Particularity Clause of the

24

Fourth Amendment.

25

The Ninth Circuit's opinion is wrong because

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the Particularity Clause of the Fourth Amendment

2

addresses two specific topics:

3

searched and the persons or things to be seized.

4

does not address the time of execution of a warrant,

5

which the Ninth Circuit impermissibly read into the

6

Fourth Amendment in violation of its text.

7

the place to be
It

The Ninth Circuit held, therefore, that

8

because the warrant was not in accordance with the

9

Particularity Clause, this search was equivalent to a

10

warrantless search and that all fruits of the search

11

had to be suppressed.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think, Mr. Dreeben, at the

13

end of the day, I agree with you on the particularity

14

argument, but do you take the -- does the Government

15

take the position that the -- that the -- that a valid

16

warrant need not contain an indication of the time

17

within which it may be served, executed?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

That's right, Justice Souter.

19

In the Government's view, the Warrant Clause

20

specifically addresses those things that need to be on

21

the face of the warrant.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As far as -What would prevent the

24

issuance of just a blanket warrant?

25

for this -- for this premises to be searched.

We have a warrant

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DREEBEN:

What would prevent the valid

2

execution of a warrant that had no time limits

3

whatsoever would be the requirement that a warrant must

4

be supported by probable cause.

5

a warrant at a time at which there was no probable

6

cause, for example, because they executed it before the

7

delivery had taken place or they executed it after a

8

time at which probable cause had become stale, the

9

search would be unreasonable and the fruits of the

10

And if agents executed

search would probably have to be suppressed.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose that a warrant

12

like a -- like a contract has a -- a reasonable life.

13

Don't you think a warrant expires if it does not have a

14

concluding date?

15

and ever?

16

reasonable time?

17

You think it goes on forever and ever

Don't you think a warrant just lasts a

MR. DREEBEN:

I think it absolutely just

18

lasts a reasonable time, Justice Scalia, and the reason

19

why there is very little law and very little litigation

20

on this is that since the 1917 statute that Congress

21

originally wrote to provide for the issuance of Federal

22

search warrants, it's provided for a 10-day execution

23

period, and that 10-day limit has been contained and

24

continued in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

25

So in the ordinary --

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Dreeben, I

2

understood you to say a short while ago that if it were

3

executed before the triggering event, it would be

4

invalid because there was no probable cause.

5
6
7
8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I -- I don't want to say

that there's no probable cause for the warrant.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, you don't because

then the warrant shouldn't have issued.
MR. DREEBEN:

No.

There -- there is probable

10

cause that the magistrate has to believe that the

11

videotape, which was one of the items to be seized,

12

would be found at the premises at the time that the

13

search was to be executed, which was represented in the

14

affidavit to be after the delivery takes place.

15

fact, the warrant is executed at a time before the

16

delivery takes place, then the warrant has failed to

17

conform to the probable cause that supported it and the

18

search would be unreasonable.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If, in

Even -- even if the warrant

20

did not specifically say that it was an anticipatory

21

warrant and that -- and that you can only execute it

22

after the delivery?

23

MR. DREEBEN:

That's right, Justice Scalia,

24

because there is an independent requirement that

25

probable cause must exist at the time of the execution

of the warrant.

Officers are --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I thought that's

supposed to be a -- a magistrate's determination.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

There are two separate things

5

that are going on.

6

at the time that he issues the warrant.

7

must find that there is probable cause to believe that

8

offense -- an offense has been committed, is being

9

committed, or is about to be committed, and that the

One is what the magistrate must do
The magistrate

10

items that the warrant is going to request to be seized

11

will be present at the location at the time of

12

execution.

13

able to make those determinations based on the warrant

14

affidavit that was submitted to him.

15

And the magistrate in this case was easily

But there is an additional requirement of

16

reasonableness, that officers may not execute a

17

warrant, even if it was validly issued, if they become

18

aware of facts that would tell a reasonable officer --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If they become aware, but

20

the -- it's a big leap from that to say that they must

21

make their own determination of probable cause.

22
23
24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I -- I think, Justice

Kennedy, the easiest example to -- to see why this -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You -- you indicated a

warrant can't be served unless they determine there's

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

probable cause, but that's for the magistrate to do, as

2

Justice Scalia --

3

MR. DREEBEN:

I -- what I -- I'm making a

4

separate point here, which is that officers have a

5

continuing obligation to act reasonably in the

6

execution of a warrant, and of course, they fulfill

7

that in a variety of ways.

8

in identifying the property that's -- that's specified

9

in the warrant and that they go to search.

They have to be reasonable

They have

10

to be reasonable in conducting the search of places

11

within that property to see that they're looking for

12

the things that are specified in the warrant and not

13

going on a fishing expedition for things that are not.

14

They have to be reasonable in deciding whether they

15

decide to dispense with knock and announce, and they

16

also have to be reasonable in deciding that the basis

17

for probable cause that they used to support the

18

issuance of the warrant has not become so stale that a

19

reasonable officer would know that that warrant should

20

not be executed.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, does that mean that

22

the executing officer must be the same officer who got

23

the warrant?

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

No, it certainly doesn't,

Justice Stevens.

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I don't know why he's going

2

to give a warrant to his -- some just call in a police

3

officer and say I want you to execute this warrant.

4

doesn't know anything about the probable cause.

5

just says he's mandated to carry out the warrant.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

He

He

Well, I -- I think in the

7

ordinary instance, it would be reasonable for the team

8

of executing officers to be responsible for the inquiry

that I'm talking about and any individual officer --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, there's no -- there's

11

no authority for that.

13

the -- the precise reason.

MR. DREEBEN:

I -- I thought warrants were

It's to search the house to
A

Well, the warrant is obtained

based on an affidavit by -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, if you want us to

19

write the opinion with this qualification in it, it

20

seems to me that you're making a big change in the way

21

search warrants are used.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

Oh, I don't think it's a big

23

change at all, Justice Kennedy, and I -- I think what

24

I'm trying to make clear here is that there's an

25

ongoing obligation of reasonableness.

Certainly the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Court does not have to get into that in this case to

2

decide it --

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- but, Mr. Dreeben,

4

there's an ongoing obligation of reasonableness in the

5

manner of which the -- in -- in the manner in which the

6

search is carried out.

7

who acts under the authority of the warrant is aware of

8

the probable cause evidence and can make a judgment

9

when that evidence either is stale or, in this case,

But unless every officer who --

10

has not yet ripened, then in fact there is no way for

11

an officer to make that kind of what you're calling the

12

reasonableness judgment in the execution of the

13

warrant.

14

for it, and that's where the timing -- we'll call it --

15

the timing clause comes in because at least an officer

16

who may not know the probable cause behind it all -- at

17

least an officer who has a warrant that says, you may

18

search between times X and Y, or a warrant that says,

19

upon the occurrence of event X and time Y, has a -- a

20

rough and sound idea of when he can act.

21

not in the warrant, the officer cannot make that

22

judgment.

23

necessarily and he doesn't know the time.

24
25

He simply doesn't have the factual background

But if that's

He doesn't know the probable cause

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, in this case, Justice

2

Ginsburg, the -- the affidavit was on the scene.

3

affiant who secured the warrant was the lead agent who

4

was in charge of the search that was carried out.

5

the -- the contents of the affidavit and the -- the

7

items that were to be searched for and when the search

8

was to take place.

The district court also found that the

in two different places, was incorporated into the

14

The search warrant itself refers to the

19

It was not -- it was not

It was in the possession --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So an officer who picked up

20

the warrant would not be able to tell necessarily.

21

he said, hey, has somebody got the affidavit, they

could have brought it forward and he could have found

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

suppose that that's right, but in -- in the concrete

2

circumstances of this case -- and I think it's

3

consistent with what I was trying to explain is

4

reasonable search warrant execution -- all of the

5

search team was fully familiar with the process that

6

was going on.

7

in which postal inspectors were arranging themselves to

8

make a delivery to the premises of the videotape in

9

question.

This -- this was a controlled delivery

Everyone on the search warrant team knew

10

that until that item had been received and taken inside

11

the house, there would be no warrant execution.

12

fact --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in

Well, but the facts

14

of the triggering event are not always going to be so

15

clean, and in many cases they're going to require an

16

exercise of judgment by the officer.

17

triggering event is a, you know, delivery of a bale of

18

marijuana or something and they see a big box coming

19

in, they're going to have say, well, is that what

20

they're talking about or is -- you know, is that it.

21

And the point is under the Fourth Amendment that those

22

types of judgments are supposed to be made by the

23

magistrate and not by the officers on the scene.

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

I mean, if the

Well, I don't think that is the

point of the Fourth Amendment.

I think what the point

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of the Fourth Amendment is is that the magistrate judge

2

makes a determination whether the facts that are

3

submitted to him rise to the level of probable cause.

4

And then the magistrate writes a warrant that's

5

consistent with what the Fourth Amendment says in terms

6

the Warrant Clause requires.

7

have to be reasonable in executing it.

8

my only point at the outset of the colloquy that I had

9

with Justice Kennedy and with Justice Souter.

10

Then the police officers
That was really

And the classic example that I think shows

11

that certainly officers may use discretion in what they

12

do in determining whether it's certain types of

13

triggering conditions are met are wiretaps because

14

wiretaps are issued on the basis that there is probable

15

cause to believe that criminal conversations will occur

in the future.

17

responsibility to conduct appropriate electronic

18

surveillance that acquires the criminal conversations

19

but not other conversations that are not within the

20

scope of the probable cause that they've obtained.

21

The officers then have the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but doesn't that simply

22

-- isn't the analogy there that when a -- when a search

23

warrant says you may -- you may pick up implements of

24

drug traffic, all it covers is drug traffic.

25

doesn't cover coffee, tea, and -- and milk.

It
In -- in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the case of the electronic surveillance, they're

2

supposed to record criminal conversations and -- but

3

not others.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the point, Justice

5

Souter, is that they have to make a judgment that

6

criminal conversations are what is going to be

7

intercepted.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But those -- those are

judgments about facts that they are finding.

They are

10

not judgments about probable cause or the moment at

11

which the warrant becomes valid.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, they're -- they're not

13

judgments here about probable cause either because the

14

magistrate has --

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it is.

The -- the

16

moment -- the triggering event is the event that

17

determines that the probable cause determination is, in

18

fact, true now.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, that's a separate

20

question, and I think the magistrate's question is, is

21

there probable cause?

22

that the probable cause is true.

23

He doesn't have to determine

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And his judgment, though, is

24

there will be probable cause when the triggering event

25

occurs.

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

3

MR. DREEBEN:

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's right.

No.

And so the triggering -I actually, Justice Souter --- the triggering event has

5

a probable cause implication, which the selection of

6

objects to be seized does not have.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

I -- I have to say that I

8

disagree fundamentally with the suggestion that he's

9

saying there will be probable cause when the triggering

10

event occurs.

11

submitted to me now, the probabilities are such that

12

evidence of this crime will be on the property when the

13

warrant is executed.

14

He's saying, based on the facts that are

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, he's saying two

15

things.

16

we're calling the triggering event will occur, and

17

there is probable -- and when that triggering event

18

occurs, there will be probable cause to believe that

19

evidence of a crime may be found and seized at such and

20

such a place.

21

There is probable cause to believe that what

There are two determinations.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I -- I don't think that

22

there's any reason linguistically to prefer your

23

formulation, Justice Souter, to the formulation that

24

says there's probable cause to believe now that when

25

the warrant is executed, in accordance with the

found.

is now concealed on the premises.

MR. DREEBEN:

The warrant says I'm

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think

8

the warrant should be read as a whole and not, as this

9

Court has indicated in many cases, a technical sense.

10

This search warrant, which is at page 47a of the

11

petition appendix, specifically refers to the attached

12

affidavit.

13

the warrant was intended to incorporate the affidavit.

14

And the district court found as a fact that

The affidavit states quite explicitly in two different

15

places that it would not be executed until the

16

triggering event occurred, and it also makes clear that

17

the triggering event was the delivery of the videotape

there is now concealed a certain person or property.

MR. DREEBEN:

know that the -- this was clearly intended to be an

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Wiretaps, Justice Stevens, are

13

regulated extensively by Federal statute, and under

14

Federal statute, a wiretap order contains a myriad of

15

details that are not specified by the Fourth Amendment.

16
17
18

Among those details are the crimes that are being
investigated and the time period of -JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but I mean in

19

describing the authority of the investigating officer

20

to execute the warrant, does it describe it just in

21

terms of a physical number that can be listened, or one

22

or more numbers, plus a time period, or does -- does it

23

say you may listen only when he's talking about foreign

24

affairs or --

It specifies the crimes that

MR. DREEBEN:

It's a minimization as to

It's a minimization as to what

6

conversations they will intercept if they listen to a

7

conversation and determine that it falls outside the

8

scope of what they're authorized to intercept.

9

the calls that -- that are intercepted in these kinds

10

of wiretaps require a considerable amount of judgment

11

and discretion.

12

Are they talking about crimes in an oblique way that

I'm -- I'm just

Could you elaborate

10

just a little bit for me on why you think this case is

11

different from Justice Scalia's hypothetical with the

12

17 people?

13

once the triggering event takes place, then you do --

14

the probable cause comes to fruition or whatever.

15

is that different than his hypothetical?

16

Because my concern is there -- here you say

MR. DREEBEN:

How

It's -- it's fundamentally

17

different.

18

that hypothetical because the measure of probable cause

19

at the time the warrant is issued is very weak under

20

Justice Scalia's hypothetical.

21

pushing the envelope.

22

some extraordinary national emergency, is probably well

23

outside the envelope for saying we have probable cause

24

to go into any particular place.

25

This case is fundamentally different from

One out of 17 is

One out of 50, at least absent

Justice Scalia's hypothetical illustrates

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that the emergence of later facts can make it very

2

clear that the agents can go in and get probable cause

3

at that moment, but this case is fundamentally

4

different because the agents have probable cause based

5

on probabilities.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is probable that this

7

package will be delivered to this individual.

8

probability exists at the time that the warrant is --

9

is issued.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

That's right.
And that's the probable

cause you're relying on.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

That

That's right.
It is probable that this

package will be delivered to this individual.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's right.

And those fact --

But that probability does

18

not support the truth of the statement that the person

19

or property so described is now concealed at the place

20

for the issuance of the warrant.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I -- I think this takes

22

me back to the fact that this warrant, number one,

23

should be construed as a whole and not -- not by virtue

24

of which box was checked and, number two, that there

25

were many items that were specified in the warrant that

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- and the warrant application that the agent had

2

reason to believe were then concealed at the time.

3

this was really a case where the form warrant was

4

inadequate to the -- to describe fully and accurately

5

what was going on.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So

Of course, if the -- if the

7

stuff was already there that supports the warrant and

8

the search, we don't even reach the question of a -- of

9

the anticipatory warrant.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I think you do in -I should say I -- I've

12

approached the case on the assumption that the only

13

thing we're worried about is whether -- whether the

14

anticipatory part is okay.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And that is -But it doesn't seem to me

17

to be a fair response to say, well, we had other

18

grounds for --

19

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

It's a -- it's a fair

20

response into -- on how the warrant was drawn and why

21

the statements that were made are not laughably wrong.

22
23
24
25

They -- they are partially inaccurate because the
videotape was clearly not on the premises at the time.

1

for rebuttal, and that is the Ninth Circuit's position,

2

even if the Ninth Circuit were correct that the

3

triggering condition needs to be in the warrant, should

4

still not lead to the suppression of evidence because

5

although the Government's submission is that the

6

triggering condition is not required by the

7

Particularity Clause, if some other doctrine under the

8

Fourth Amendment did require it to be in the warrant,

9

the warrant should be treated as one that is at most

10

overbroad as to the time of permissible execution.

11

That is, on its face it would authorize the warrant to

12

be executed from the moment of issuance until 10 days

13

after issuance instead of from the moment that the

14

triggering condition is satisfied until 10 days after

15

issuance.

16

When courts have confronted overbroad

17

warrants, what they have done is ask is there probable

18

cause that supports part of this warrant.

19

answer to that is yes, the next question is, is the

20

evidence that's sought to be suppressed acquired under

21

the part of the warrant that was validly supported by

22

probable cause?

If the answer to that is yes, there's

23

no suppression.

The warrant is, in effect, severed and

the only suppression that can be obtained is as to

the triggering condition was satisfied, the videotape

correlation between probable cause showings that were

Mr. Reichel, it -- it seems

to me it's part of your case that the probable cause

19

the passage of time.

20

Are you --

the mob leader will be in this apartment.

6

can that warrant issue?

7

Okay?

It will take half an hour to get to
The magistrate knows that when it's served,

MR. REICHEL:

Can that --

Yes, because the magistrate has

8

determined that there's probable cause to believe that

9

at the time of the search, the contraband, the purpose

10

of the search, will be present in that particularly

11

described location.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right, and -- and likewise,

13

it -- it would work the other way.

14

had the same facts, the -- the mob leader is going to

15

be there between 6:30 and 6:45, and the warrant is

presented to him at 6:30, he would have to decline it

going to be gone.

19

MR. REICHEL:

looking to the condition when -- when the warrant is

I

Justice Scalia, what the

magistrate is predicting is that there will be receipt,

10

but the magistrate is -- is not predicting that there

11

will be contraband inside of that house at that point.

12

He's actually shipping that discretion to the officer

13

in the field.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but it's probable.

At

15

the time that he issues the warrant, it is probable

16

that this person will be receiving contraband because

17

they showed, you know, this guy sent for it.

Mr. Reichel, one of the

time, is on the lookout for it.

whether or not he'll issue the warrant.

What if the magistrate specified that out of
an abundance of caution?

It's just the same case, but

10

he writes on the warrant, this warrant is not to be

11

served until 6:30.

12

Whereas, it was valid before, it's not valid if he --

13

if he says I am anticipating what will be the situation

14

when the warrant is executed.

15

it can't be served until 6:30.

16

Does that make it invalid?

MR. REICHEL:

He says it explicitly,
Does that make it bad?

Textually he -- textually under

17

the language of the Fourth Amendment, he cannot issue

18

the warrant for service at 6:30 when probable cause --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Doesn't it strike you as --

20

as strange that it's perfectly okay if he issues it at

21

6 o'clock, knowing that it'll be -- won't -- that there

22

isn't probable cause now, but there will be at 6:30

23

when it will be served.

You say that's perfectly okay.

But if he says it on a warrant, not to be served until
6:30, it suddenly becomes bad.

Amendment, that it must be clearly stated that the time

JUSTICE BREYER:

I agree, Your Honor.
All right.

I -- I have a

question that you could just clarify a confusion.

want to bring into this case the question of whether or

not anticipatory warrants are ever valid.

in the First Circuit where I explained my view on that.

You

I had a case

I thought they would be reasonably described.

So I

don't know if that issue should be brought up here.

Maybe.

I can't figure out what issue should be

we ought to read these things in a common sense

Where -- where do you derive this proposition?

MR. REICHEL:

I believe that not for -- for

all cases, I cannot answer the question, but for cases

4

of anticipatory search warrants where the officers are

5

going to finalize the issuing process, the officers are

6

completely in control of the manufacture and completely

7

in control of the completion of the delivery of the

8

contraband, and if a magistrate has allowed them to

9

make that decision in the field, that has to be clearly

10

stated to satisfy the particularity requirement on the

11

front page of the warrant so that any officer executing

12

it, not just those who -- who seek the warrant, but the

13

officer executing it, is keenly aware of his limit to

14

search.

15

the other factors of the particularity requirement that

16

this has announced in --

As well, it puts the homeowner on notice of

also have satisfied the objection of the warrant -- the

argument you make in this Court?

8

made it clear that there is now probable cause to

9

believe it will be there at the time of the execution.

10

Why isn't that sufficient to make the warrant valid?

11
12

Because it would have

MR. REICHEL:

It will make the warrant valid

under the Particularity Clause.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Will it also satisfy the

14

text of the Constitution that says no warrant shall

15

issue except upon probable cause?

16

why is it not adequate probable cause to say we believe

17

that will probably happen when the anticipatory event

18

occurs?

19

MR. REICHEL:

And I'm asking you

Because the text of the -- of

20

the probable cause requirement in the Fourth Amendment

21

has clearly been announced by this Court to always

22

require the magistrate's determination of the facts, as

23

make that determination.

adequate probable cause for issuing that warrant right

pretty hard for me to try to understand what this

warrant is about if I'm supposed to understand it, by

16

reading through about 15 or 20 pages of small print and

17

there discovering somewhere in the back of it some --

18

the post office says I'm not going to execute this

the warrant, the only clue to that fact being the word

anticipatory.

this anxiety, which is going to help you, is connected

to something in the law.

And there we are.

MR. REICHEL:
to abuse by nature.

7

Now, you tell me why

Justice Breyer, they are prone

They are --

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, please don't.

I start

8

with an assumption that an anticipatory warrant is

9

constitutionally valid.

10

I start with that assumption.

I'm assuming that the conditions have to reasonably

11

describe.

12

this warrant doesn't seem to be an anticipatory warrant

13

but for one word, and to know what it's about, you have

14

to look through 28 pages of fine print.

15

connect that anxiety to something in the law.

My anxiety is resting only on the fact that

Now, you

16

MR. REICHEL:

17

In Groh v. Ramirez, this Court set forth very

Thank you, Justice Breyer.

18

clearly that the purpose of the particularity

19

requirement serves two functions.

20

enforcement; the second is for the homeowner.

21

law enforcement, it is very clear in these -- this

22

Court's decisions that that must be so that the officer

23

executing it can simply and quickly and efficiently

24

determine the limits of their power to search.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

what, where, but also when.

4

acknowledge that if you're wrong about that, if you're

5

wrong about the fact that who, what, and where

automatically includes when, the argument you've just

made doesn't get anywhere.

MR. REICHEL:

Right?

I mean, you -- you

Justice Scalia, I -- I can --

it is inherent in the place, the objects, and the
persons to be searched in a particularity --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that's your

12

argument, but you agree that if -- if that argument is

13

wrong, you're done.

14

MR. REICHEL:

That's correct.

With regard to

15

anticipatory warrants, time is part of the

16

particularity requirement.

17

of the warrant,

18

probable cause that contraband will be present, the

19

time of the determination of probable cause, which is

20

the triggering event, which comes from the Fourth

21

Amendment itself --

22

The time of the execution

the time of the determination of

issuance.

MR. REICHEL:

That's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And could it be if the

officer knows that this package -- let's say it's

5

loaded with dynamite or guns or drugs -- is going to be

6

delivered at a certain time and it -- the delivery

7

occurs, and then the officer busts in and says, there's

exigent circumstances.

drugs and they'll be off the premises.

11

They're going to take those
That might

happen.
MR. REICHEL:

That might happen.

Exigent

12

circumstances in the execution of a warrant were not

13

presented in this case.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, my -- my question

15

is, isn't it better to have the police go to the

16

magistrate when there's time for the magistrate to

17

reflect, than to have this scenario where the police

18

will say this was really dangerous stuff, exigent

19

circumstances?

20

in advance for the warrant?

21

Wouldn't you want the officer to apply

MR. REICHEL:

Justice -- Justice Ginsburg,

22

yes, I would.

23

would also have to leave the final determination as to

24

whether probable cause has been completed to the

25

magistrate through the use of many alternatives,

And I think at that point the officers

including a telephonic warrant where the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

magistrate told we've set this whole thing up?

put this package in the mail.

magistrate told that?

MR. REICHEL:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We've

It's going to be
Wasn't the

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.
So why was there a need

for a second call when exactly that happened?

10

MR. REICHEL:

Well, specifically what was

11

highlighted in this case is that the individual

12

receiving the package was his wife, Justice Ginsburg.

13

And it's -- it's clear in the record that she received

14

it.

15

she said to the officers is what is going on here and

16

why are you here?

here?

18

the court of appeals decisions and other court

19

decisions, that this crime, the knowing receipt of the

20

illegal material, had not been completed.

21

been no crime committed at that point.

22

no -- no knowing receipt of the illegality of this.

23

There's never been any evidence --

24
25

Moments later, they rushed in.

The first thing

What is going on here?

they're here.

He was inside the --

MR. REICHEL:

Justice Ginsburg, he was inside

the house, and he walked outside thereafter.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, and they -- and they

7

found other -- other videotapes besides the one that

8

had just been delivered, didn't they, in the course of

9

the search?

10

MR. REICHEL:

11

Now, but they did enter the house prior --

They did, Justice Scalia.

12

they entered the house prior to a lawful triggering

13

condition.

14

contacted the magistrate immediately, advised what had

15

happened, who would have realized at that point that a

16

crime had not been committed, that there was not

17

probable cause that this crime, the knowing receipt,

18

had been committed.

19

In such an example, they could have

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And exactly the same thing

20

would be true if they had stated the triggering event

21

clearly somewhere in -- in the warrant.

22

argument here is that the triggering event was stated

23

in the affidavit.

24
25

MR. REICHEL:

The -- the

But this does -- Justice

Souter, this highlights why the triggering event must

1

be clearly, specifically drawn by a magistrate with

2

studied caution about the exact factors for probable

3

cause which would allow this search.

4

buried in some affidavit somewhere, if it's not on the

5

front of the warrant, or if it's vested in the

6

discretion of the officer to make that determination

7

whether that's close enough, then it is prone to these

8

abuses and it is -- requires the magistrate to make

9

that final legal determination.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Dreeben, a quick yes or

17

no.

18

anticipatory warrant, the warrant is not properly

19

executed until the -- the anticipated event occurs?

Does the Government concede that when you have an

20

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Justice Scalia, because

21

the representations that are made to the magistrate to

22

secure the warrant include the fact that the warrant

23

will not be executed and the agents should --

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:
a little.

But that -- that puzzles me

The -- the affidavit says execution will not

take place until the event.

2

search, which is in the last paragraph, is not limited

3

to the time after the anticipatory event.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

But the authority to

That's true because I think

5

that the magistrate is making the common sense judgment

6

that this will be -- we don't know exactly when --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I mean, not even -- it is

8

not only the warrant, but the affidavit itself doesn't

9

say we merely request permission to search after the --

10

after the event.

11

to search.

12

It's a general request for authority

MR. DREEBEN:

It makes the representation,

13

and I think what draws the link between the conditions

14

that are represented to occur before the warrant will

15

be executed and the warrant itself are paragraphs 1, 2,

16

and 3 of the items that are to be seized because those

17

pertain --

18
19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

I'm drawing your

attention to paragraphs 61 and 64 of the affidavit.

MR. DREEBEN:

I understand that, Justice

21

Stevens.

22

videotape and its containers which are paragraphs 1, 2,

23

and 3.

24
25

But the -- the items to be seized include the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but the authority is

broader than the authority to search for those items.

1

MR. DREEBEN:

That's true.

But those items

2

-- the magistrate can conclude that there's probable

3

cause to believe that they'll be on the premises only

4

after delivery has taken place.

5

issued the warrant, and the three principal items at

6

the top are those things.

7

that the magistrate formed the view that there's

8

probable cause to believe that these items will be on

9

the --

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the magistrate has

So it's logical to conclude

But it takes a step of

11

reasoning beyond merely saying we incorporate the --

12

the affidavit into the warrant.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

I think it takes a very small

14

step of logical inference, but I agree with you,

15

Justice Stevens, that it doesn't say everything that is

16

logically implied in the magistrate's probable cause

17

finding.

18

is predicated on the view that the items will be there

19

because the Postal Service has represented they'll

20

deliver them.

21

But the magistrate's probable cause finding

The burden of the Ninth Circuit's view is

22

that the Particularity Clause applies to the triggering

23

condition and mandates that it be stated in the text

24

even though the Fourth Amendment's text doesn't contain

25

that requirement.

This Court in Dalia v. United States

58
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

rejected a similar effort to add a requirement to a

2

warrant that would authorize surreptitious entry to

3

install a covert bugging device, and the Court's

4

reasoning in Dalia makes clear that the Court was

5

unwilling to go on a progressive path of reading things

6

into the Fourth Amendment's Particularity Clause that

7

are not there.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you just want us to say,

look, the Ninth Circuit is wrong.

They're okay to have

10

conditional warrants like this and there is no absolute

11

rule you always have to have the triggering condition

12

in.

13

confusing, send them back and let them figure it out.

14

As to whether this is too confusing or not too

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I don't want the Court to

15

send it back to the Ninth Circuit to impose yet new

16

requirements on the execution of warrants.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. DREEBEN:

What I want the Court to hold

19

is that the triggering condition in an anticipatory

20

warrant is not subsumed in the Particularity Clause and

21

therefore it need not be in the face of the warrant at

22

all.

23

did, that a warrant that's executed after the

24

triggering condition has occurred, does not require

25

suppression of evidence.

And alternatively, if the Court believed that it
