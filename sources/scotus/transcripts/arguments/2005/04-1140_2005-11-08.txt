CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

Mr. Heldman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL H. HELDMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. HELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

Section 1447(c) provides for fee -- for a

12

fee award -- allows a fee award when a case is

13

remanded to State court.

14

statute providing for a fee award to a defendant who

15

removes, and successfully defends against, a motion

16

to remand.

17

award against a plaintiff who wrongly invokes the

18

original jurisdiction in Federal District courts.

19

This indication that there is something

There is, by contrast, no

There is no statute providing for a fee

20

peculiarly troublesome and problematic about an

21

incorrect removal is borne out in the case law of

22

this Court and other courts and in the experience, I

23

submit, of every practicing lawyer, that incorrect

24

removals have detrimental effects, both private and

25

systemic, yet Respondents would read section 1447(c)

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in a way that would leave it essentially without

2

practical effect in the world of litigation.

3

would give no -- it would not effect litigation

4

behavior to any perceptible degree.

5

text of the statute, when read in context, and in

6

light of the legal landscape, and the large

7

objectives and equitable considerations at stake

8

here, weigh in favor of a standard that would, as

9

the Seventh Circuit put it, make fee awards the norm

10

It

But both the

in cases of improper removal.

11

Turning, first, to the text of the

12

statute, the statute is notable, in that, unlike

13

many fee-shifting statutes, it runs only in one

14

direction.

15

when the case is remanded.

16

indicium of remanding, for two reasons.

17

all, it shows that the concern was with the

18

incorrect removals, and the problems they cause in

19

deterring them, rather than a more general concern

20

about mitigation about questions of jurisdiction.

21

That is, a defendant cannot get a fee award even if

22

the plaintiff's motion to remand was not very

23

strong.

24
25

That is to say, it allows for fees only
This is a good textual
First of

The second thing that the one-way nature
tells us is that this, the statute, would be

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

practically meaningless if read as the Solicitor

2

General suggests, and as Respondents suggest, in all

3

but a little sliver, to allow fees only when the

4

removal is unreasonable.

5

precise duplicate of Rule 11, it would at least be

6

close enough to a precise duplicate of Rule 11.

7
8

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, Rule 11 is about

frivolous arguments and motions, is it not?

9
10

If that would not be a

MR. HELDMAN:

It is -- yes, Your Honor,

that's the shorthand of Rule 11.

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes.

And

12

Christiansburg Garment is about unreasonable

13

arguments.

14

argument could be deemed to be a frivolous one.

15

I suppose that not every unreasonable

MR. HELDMAN:

I would -- I agree with you,

16

Your Honor, there is that -- there is a possible

17

sliver of a distinction, but I -- and, I submit, any

18

lawyer advising a client and any lawyer advising

19

himself or herself -- would have a hard time

20

differentiating between the two standards, in

21

practice, so as actually --

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

23

Don't you think you

know it when you see it?

24

[Laughter.]

25

MR. HELDMAN:

I try to avoid all of them,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Your Honor, the frivolous and the unreasonable,

2

both.

3

And I think we all do.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But, when Congress

4

passed this language, the scope of Rule 11 was not

5

as well defined and understood as it is now.

6

the overlap argument you're making may not really go

7

to what Congress had in mind.

8
9

MR. HELDMAN:

So,

The overlap may not have

been perfect, at least, among other things, in the

10

sense that some courts were still under the

11

misimpression that there was a subjective element to

12

Rule 11, as well.

13

correct in saying that there is that logically

14

possible reason for the enactment of the statute, in

15

that there is not a perfect overlay.

16

that, in light of the other available textual

17

indicia and the policy reasons, that logically

18

possible hypothesis is not the most reasonable

19

hypothesis.

20

So, the Solicitor General is

We submit

We have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you talk

21

about the text, though -- and I understand that the

22

"may" language here has been read by the Court in

23

very different ways, depending upon the statute --

24

but you have a statute that literally alternates

25

sentences between "shall/may," "shall/may," and it

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

seems to me that if your rule is closer to "shall"

2

than "may," it seems that it was an odd choice of

3

words for Congress to employ.

4

MR. HELDMAN:

I think the reason why I

5

would disagree with that, respectfully, Your Honor,

6

is, we are not suggesting that it means "shall" in

7

all instances in which a case is remanded.

8

we are -- or standard we are advocating for deals

9

with that set of cases in which a plaintiff has

The rule

10

successfully sought remand.

11

constitute most of the cases that are remanded, but

12

there is still the -- a separate category of cases,

13

at least one -- the case is remanded sua sponte.

14

could well envision that those would not be governed

15

by a "shall" rule for an award of expenses and fees.

16
17

Now, that may

I

The -JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that -- it could be

18

remanded sua sponte for any number of reasons, so --

19

so, you're saying not that there is some wiggle room

20

to allow "may" to operate, you're simply saying it

21

depends on the party that initiates the remand.

22

I guess my question is, Could you give us an

23

example, or examples, of a remand on a party's

24

motion, on a plaintiff's motion, in which the fees

25

would not be allowed?

And

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HELDMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think

2

the classic example would be if a plaintiff's

3

complaint, for whatever reasons of negligence or

4

error, misalleges the plaintiff's State of

5

residence; thus, making the defendant reasonably

6

believe that there is complete diversity, defendant

7

removes, plaintiff then submits affidavits and

8

property records and everything showing it really

9

was a mistake.

10

And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the

11

plaintiff who waits over a year to move for remand

12

when it appears as though the case is going in the

13

defendant's favor?

14

court discretion to say, "I'm not going to reward a

15

plaintiff, who wants to go back to State court only

16

when he was on the brink of losing in Federal court,

17

with fees."

18

Doesn't "may" give a district

MR. HELDMAN:

I think, even in that

19

hypothetical case, which I will say, next, is not

20

this case -- even in that hypothetical case, it is

21

still the plaintiff who has the cleanest hands of

22

all.

23

of the defendant --

24
25

The plaintiff's hands are cleaner than those

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Just -- you say that

your presumptive fees are included would cover that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

case.

2

because you didn't move to remand until the case was

3

pending in the Federal District court for over a

4

year.

It, in part, is -- resembles your case,

5
6
7

MR. HELDMAN:

And if the Court would like, I could explain a
little bit more about why that occurred.

8
9

That's correct, Your Honor.

When the case was removed -- the
plaintiffs in this case, unlike plaintiffs in many

10

cases, did not have a preference for State court.

11

There was no attempt to plead around removal.

12

the case was removed, and it was an arguably correct

13

removal.

14

position, unfortunately, due to --

15

And plaintiffs' counsel were then in the

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, indeed, wasn't

16

there a change in the law after the case was

17

removed?

18

MR. HELDMAN:

There were relevant changes

19

in law in some circuits, Your Honor.

20

don't believe any dispositive change in Tenth

21

Circuit law --

22

And

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

There was -- I

Well, the Tenth

23

Circuit, I thought, held that the district court was

24

within its discretion to deny the award, because, at

25

the time of the removal, the defendants had

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

objectively reasonable grounds to believe that

2

removal was proper.

3

MR. HELDMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And we do

4

not dispute that standard, because there were out-

5

of-circuit cases, though later overruled by those

6

own circuits.

7

could be aggregated.

8

one of the bases for removal, but not the only one.

9

We've suggested that punitive damages
And that was the -- that was

So, when plaintiffs removed the case,

10

plaintiffs had no incentive, by virtue of 1447(c),

11

in the way it had been interpreted in the Tenth

12

Circuit, to make remand their first order of

13

business, given plaintiffs' experience that these

14

battles can be long and hard and unrewarding.

15

the removal was arguably correct.

16

And

Now, by a year later, that had changed.

17

That calculus of the plaintiffs' counsel had changed

18

when defendant -- one of the defendants -- put in an

19

affidavit suggesting that the named plaintiffs had

20

no damages.

21

changed, because there was, at this point, a very

22

real risk that if plaintiffs ignored the problem now

23

and proceeded to a victory in the district court,

24

then that victory could be vacated at the

25

defendant's interest -- instance, by claiming a lack

At this point, the plaintiffs' calculus

2

the plaintiffs could not take at that point.

3

And this, then, was a risk that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you stated, at the

4

outset -- and, I think, properly so -- that we're

5

interested in what incentives --

MR. HELDMAN:

I -- my basic answer as to

18

why that would be the policy, Your Honor, are,

19

again, the textual reasons and the large objective

20

reasons.

21

textual reasons, if that is satisfactory.

22

Let me go back to the -- finishing up the

The statute previously had said -- had

23

included the word "improvidently."

24

costs could be awarded, and not fees, the statute

25

had used the word "improvidently."

Back when only

Now, many courts -

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

- and I don't vouch for this interpretation, but I

2

note that it was prevalent -- many courts then said

3

costs may be awarded, or should be awarded, only

4

when the removal was improvident, in the sense of

5

being worse than merely incorrect.

6

deleted that word, "improvident" -- "improvidently."

7

And the Congress

Now, this, I submit, is a good indication

8

that the Congress did not mean for there to be a

9

standard of "worse than incorrectness."

Had

10

Congress meant for that to be the standard, then

11

Congress would not have deleted the word that had

12

gotten many courts there, or Congress would have put

13

in some other textual reason.

8

remanding the case may require payment of just costs

9

and any actual expenses, including attorneys fees,

But, "an order

10

incurred as a result of the removal," does that mean

11

that if, after the removal there are substantial

12

proceedings in the trial court, in an appeal, and so

13

on, and then you suddenly discover that the -- there

14

was a mistake and you remand -- you can get fees for

all the litigation work that took place in the

interim?

couldn't it?

fight over whether removal was proper.

19

It could be a very large sum of money,
It's not just fees incident to the

MR. HELDMAN:

I believe that's correct,

20

Your Honor.

21

natural reading of that language is that the

22

district court, at least in the first instance, will

23

have fact-finding authority as to what fees and other

24

expenses were --

25

I believe that -- to me, the most

include all sorts of discovery and arguments on

6

motions and so forth that might actually save time

7

in the subsequent proceeding, if it goes back to the

8

State court.

9

MR. HELDMAN:

My anticipation would be

10

that most courts would use their factfinding

11

authority to try to figure out what work would have

12

to be reduplicated in the

13

compensate that work, or the work that only arose by

14

virtue of it being in Federal court.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

State court, to

So, the judge's

16

discretion includes both whether or not to include

17

any fees, and he also has quite a bit of discretion

18

on what to include in the fee award, I suppose.

19

MR. HELDMAN:

I think that's right, Your

20

Honor.

21

"factfinding authority," I think that's right.

That

22

is a separate question from what we have here.

authority and the main --

I've proposed

11

what I suggest would be the standard, which is,

going back to the text, "what expenses were incurred

14

"what were in -- what costs and fees were incurred

that would not have been recur -- incurred, or would

16

not have been incurred again, had the case been left

in State court."

JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to know what it is

2

you're arguing for.

3

through all these words in the attorneys-fees cases,

4

I've got it in my mind that, like the civil rights

statute, they say, "You normally get fees, unless

6

you shouldn't."

normally gonna to get them.

That is, I -- when I get

All right?

That means you're

Yes.
The plaintiff, anyway.

10

All right?

11

The copyright says it's all the way up to the

12

district court, really, which means a grab-bag, and

13

what the particular judge thinks is fair in the

14

instance.

15

"You hardly ever get fees."

16

it, "Well, who knows?" and, "No, you almost always

17

do," or, "No, you almost always don't."

18

19

of those three are you arguing for?

Then we have a case with a copyright.

And I guess you could have a rule saying,

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, if you

8

want "you always get them," in the civil liberties

9

cases there is a good policy reason, according to

10

the court, underlying that judgment of how Congress

11

wanted to give this to people to vindicate civil

12

liberties.

the Federal court door, because if, in fact, you

14

were to have that rule in this case, it would simply

discourage people from removing it in cases where

with the cases that were incorrectly removed.

the real question, I think, when we get down to the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN T. CHILTON

6

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

7
8

MR. CHILTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

9

Since the first Judiciary Act of 1789,

10

Congress has given defendants the right to remove

11

cases to Federal court.

12

in this case, and there's no dispute about that.

13

The -- both lower courts found that we had

14

reasonable grounds for removal, on two bases --

15

based on the only circuit court decisions then

16

extant on aggregating punitive damages and attorneys

17

fees.

18

morning and also in the trial court, district court,

19

before they moved to remand, a year after removal

20

and after the district court in the same hearing had

21

indicated its tentative decision to rule against

22

them on the merits of a dismissal motion.

23

Respondents did so properly

Petitioners conceded that fact here this

So, the issue before the Court today is

24

whether 1447(c) requires a district court to impose

25

a substantial penalty in the form of attorneys fees

25
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

on Respondents for what is concededly in this case a

2

reasonable, but ultimately unsuccessful, exercise of

3

their statutory right to remove.

4

And we think the answer to that answer to

5

that question is clearly no, for two reasons.

6

first is that Section 1447(c) is not a fee-shifting

7

statute at all.

8

the Act of March 3, 1875, Section 1447(c) just

9

confirms the district court's power to award fees,

The

Like its predecessor, Section 5 of

10

as well as costs, when it lacks subject-matter

11

jurisdiction and, therefore, must remand the case.

12

There was a prior contrary common-law rule, and the

13

Act of March 3, 1875 abrogated it.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

allows Rule 11 fees to be imposed --

16

MR. CHILTON:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're saying that it

Yes, Your Honor.
-- which otherwise

18

wouldn't be imposable.

19

cuts against that interpretation is the fact that it

20

does try to set some standard.

21

remanding the case may require payment of just cause

22

-- just costs and any actual expenses, including

23

attorneys fees."

24

that's a standard.

25

Rule 11 and apply whatever standard Rule 11

It seems to me that what

It says, "An order

Especially the "just costs,"
It's not saying, "You can use

contains."

2

What's your response to that?
MR. CHILTON:

My response would be that,

3

as the questioning already today in the Court has

4

revealed, there are two questions on a fee motion.

5

One is entitlement, the other is amount.

6

costs" refers to amount, not entitlement.

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

"Just

But I'm -- I don't --

8

I'm not sure that I agree with you that Rule 11

reasonable costs, are we not?

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

interest to ask us to apply Rule 11?

22

that, in future cases, it will be less likely that

23

these are awarded?

24
25

MR. CHILTON:

You're hoping

Well, we're proposing our

first argument, because we think it's textually

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

correct and historically correct.

2

same result, in our case, a point I was about to

3

make.

4

construe this statute as a fee-shifting statute, the

5

standard under the fee-shifting statute should be

6

the one that Your Honor just mentioned, which is,

7

it's a multifactor test, but the primary factor is

8

whether the ground for removal is objectively

9

reasonable.

It leads to the

Our second argument is that, even if you

10

And under that standard, we win.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Now, the Solicitor

11

General, I guess, suggests that the Christiansburg

12

Garment standard is the appropriate one.

13

MR. CHILTON:

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

15
16

That is true, he does.
And do you disagree

with that?
MR. CHILTON:

Well, our two standards, I

17

believe, are relatively close.

18

objective reasonableness of the removal.

19

Solicitor General, I believe, is a little bit less -

20

- leaves a little bit less discretion to the

21

district court than we would.

22

Congress, in using the word "may," in using, if you

23

wanted to look at this as a fee-shifting statute,

24

the word "just," meant to leave district courts with

25

considerable range of discretion to deal with cases

We both focus on the
Now, the

1

that come up that are unusual in the way a party can

removal.

4

as the plaintiff did before seeking a remand.

5

Obviously a plaintiff --

10

For example, in this case, waiting as long

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but there had

been case-law changes, hadn't there?
MR. CHILTON:

There had been, but that was

not the reason for their delayed motion for remand.
As they explained in the trial court, the reason

11

they suddenly became aware, supposedly, of the right

12

to remand was this declaration saying that they, the

13

plaintiffs, hadn't paid any money for collateral

14

protection insurance, a fact of which they must have

15

been aware at the time they filed their complaint.

16

Furthermore, in the Tenth Circuit, you cannot look

17

to any document, other than the complaint or notice

18

of removal, to establish the facts for removal

19

jurisdiction.

20

possibly have justified a motion to remand.

21

Therefore, the declaration could not

But, in any case, my more general point,

22

apart from the facts of this case, is that there are

23

cases in which one party or the other uses remand to

24

basically avoid a -- an adverse decision on the

25

substance, and when that party does, whether it's

29
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the defendant or the plaintiff, we feel that the

2

district court ought to have discretion to award

3

fees.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought a

5

comparative advantage of the Solicitor General's

6

approach, and, by the same token, of the

7

Petitioner's contrary approach, is that it avoids a

8

lot of litigation over a collateral issue, like

9

which court you ought to be in.

As soon as you get

10

into a multifactor analysis, then you get briefs on

11

both sides arguing their factors and the other

12

side's factors, and the judge has to decide.

13

there's a presumption that applies in most cases,

14

you don't waste time over jurisdictional squabbles

15

like this.

16

MR. CHILTON:

If

Well, first you have the

17

jurisdictional dispute, of course, resolved.

18

only when there's a remand that you get to the fee

19

issue.

20

obviously a categorical rule will have less

21

litigation than a multifactor test.

22

is, What did Congress want? -- not, What will reduce

23

litigation costs?

24

have wanted, in this situation, and did want, to

25

allow for discretion to be exercised.

It's

But, your more general point is, yes,

The question

And we believe Congress would

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

limited discretion under our test, because if -- in

2

general, if the removal is objectively reasonable,

3

as ours was, we believe Congress would not have

4

allowed an award of fees, except in those

5

circumstances, as I've mentioned, where the system

6

is being gamed by one party or another.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's hard to have three

8

different kinds of standards with attorneys-fees

9

statutes.

I mean, there are quite a few of them,

10

and -- I can understand saying some of those

11

statutes mean you almost always should get it,

12

because of special policies reflected in the history

13

of the statute, et cetera.

14

And I can imagine Fogerty, where you say, "As to an

15

ordinary one, it's ordinary."

16

up to the discretion of the district judge.

17

there may be many reasons.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

[Laughter.]

2

MR. CHILTON:

-- we believe that

3

discretion is not only the better part of valor, but

4

what Congress enacted in this statute.

5

what Fogerty said -- "may" means "may," it doesn't

6

mean "must" -- it connotes discretion -- and that an

7

automatic rule for the award of fees on remand, or

8

even the contrary rule, would pretermit that

9

discretion, so that when, as in this case, there are

10

not overriding public-policy -- public policies that

11

are enforced by one party -- for example, in the

12

civil rights cases, where it is the plaintiff who is

13

the private attorney general enforcing what this

14

Court has said, or Congress's most important

15

policies -- when that's not present, as in this

16

case, then "may" means "may."

17

so when, as in this case, the defendant is not a

18

violator of Federal law, has done nothing that

19

impinges or removes rights from the defendant -- or,

20

excuse me, the plaintiff -- but, in fact, serves

21

Federal interest in seeking removal.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's

Particularly, that's

That --

I suppose that one could

23

assume that to be the congressional intent, if

Congress often has such an intent for such

substantial imposition of financial liability.

financial liability to be subjected to the

MR. CHILTON:

The Freedom of Information

15

Act, Your Honor, which was passed in 1974, which,

interestingly, I think, undermines the Petitioner's

somehow incorporated the "Newman" standard.

MR. CHILTON:

12

Your Honor-- the imposition of fees discourages

when there's more than one-third, and less than two-

complaint was originally filed, they're in the

remand the case, even if it's properly brought in

7

So, my general point is that Congress has

enacted these removal statutes to promote Federal

policy, and that it would be counter to that policy

10

to discourage defendants from removing cases,

11

particularly if the amount of fees that could be

awarded would include all the fees incurred in
