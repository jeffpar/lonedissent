ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Court can decide these cases, as it

11

decided Crawford without testing the outer bounds of

12

the Confrontation Clause, by adopting a simple

13

proposition that is easily understood by and

14

intuitively sensible to ordinary lay people and so

15

capable of being passed on from generation to

16

generation as one of the cornerstones of our

17

fundamental liberties.

18

A criminal conviction cannot be based on an

19

accusation made privately to a known law enforcement

20

officer.

21

be presented in support of a conviction, then it must

22

ensure that the accuser testifies in the manner long

23

required by the common law system of criminal justice,

24

in the presence of the accused, under oath, and subject

25

to cross examination.

If a State wishes that such an accusation

1

As in Crawford, the Court does not need to

2

offer a comprehensive definition of the term

3

testimonial.

4

a known law enforcement officer must be testimonial

5

under any plausible definition.

6

It is enough to say that an accusation to

JUSTICE BREYER:

When, for example, there's

7

an undercover agent, a law enforcement officer -- let's

8

think of the mafia or the Ku Klux Klan reveals himself.

11

One of the co-conspirators during the ongoing
conspiracy switches sides.

But no.

He's still in the conspiracy.

He doesn't switch.

Makes a whole lot of

12

statements.

13

come in now because they would be in the furtherance of

14

the conspiracy.

15
16
17

Those are all inadmissible, though they'd

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Statements in furtherance of a

conspiracy, if I understand -JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

There -- but there's

18

-- in other words, I've got your definition and all

19

I've tried to do is create a circumstance where, while

20

it fits your definition, it's made by a person that is

21

in the conspiracy.

22

enforcement officer.

So if it's --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Yes.

-- if it's an undercover agent

and so it's a statement to an undercover -JUSTICE BREYER:

So you're saying my

10

hypothetical could never come up.

11

do is -- it seems to me that your hypothetical is going

12

to take statements that would come in that are pretty

13

far removed from the prosecution that are in odd

14

circumstances, are not just a testimonial at all in

15

anybody's thought, but it keeps them out.

What I'm trying to

16

MR. FRIEDMAN:

17

fully understand the hypothetical.

18

officer is not known to the declarant as a law

19

enforcement officer, then there's no problem.

20

then the statement could --

I -- I'm afraid I -- I don't

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. FRIEDMAN:

If the -- if the

Then --

He's known.

If he's -- he's known to the

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It's a continuing conspiracy,

2

but -- but that statement to the law enforcement

3

officer saying that somebody else in the conspiracy has

4

committed a crime, would not, in fact, be in

5

furtherance of the conspiracy.

6

conspiracy apart.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

It would blow the

All right.

You've convinced

me I have a bad hypothetical.

9

(Laughter.)

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. FRIEDMAN:

You go ahead.

I -- I don't think it's --

12

Your Honor, I feel duty-bound to say there are no bad

13

hypotheticals, but there are -- there are easy ones,

14

and I think if -- if it's a known officer -- it's -- in

15

that situation, it's going to be accusatorial.

16

not a known officer, it's -- it's not accusatorial --

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

If it's

What if a statement is made

18

to a known law enforcement officer providing

19

information that's -- that's very incriminating against

20

somebody, but it doesn't specifically identify that

21

person?

22

Does that fall within your test?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I -- I believe it does.

Of

23

course, in this case we have both, a description of the

24

crime and an identification of the perpetrator.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it's an accusation even

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

though it doesn't identify the person who is alleged to

2

be the perpetrator?

3

MR. FRIEDMAN:

We could call it what we will.

4

I think -- I think that it still would be within the

5

narrow proposition that we're advocating that a -- that

6

a description of the crime to a known --

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

So really, your test is any

8

evidence that's -- any statement made to the police or

9

-- is an -- is testimony.

10

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, Your Honor.

I think it --

11

it either has to describe a crime or identify the

12

perpetrator or, as in this case, do both.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

to law enforcement is testimonial.

15

MR. FRIEDMAN:

So --

Any relevant evidence given

Well, when you say -- when you

16

say relevant, I think that if the law enforcement

17

officer -- if -- if it's a statement to a known law

18

enforcement officer in the line of duty, it's -- it's

19

almost always going to be testimonial.

20

identifies the -- the perpetrator or describes the

21

crime, I would say it's clearly testimonial, or if it's

22

in response to the -- to the officer's inquiries, it's

23

clearly --

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

If it -- if it

If somebody calls and says, I

just saw a blue Toyota with Ohio plates commit a hit

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

and run, that's testimonial?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I believe -- I believe so.

3

Now -- now, in fact, that would provide some

4

identifying information because it is a person who is

5

associated with that blue -- with that blue Toyota.

6

But if it's simply a officer in the donut shop, I just

7

saw Jack, he's back in town, with no clear relation to

8

any -- any crime, that's presumably just chatter and

9

that wouldn't be testimonial even if it -- even if it

10
11
12
13

later becomes relevant.
JUSTICE ALITO:

But if it's relevant that

Jack is back in town, then that's testimonial.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

If -- if at the moment that

14

it's made, the declarant understands that Jack being

15

back in town might be useful in an investigation, or if

16

a reasonable person in the position of the declarant

17

would understand it, that would be testimonial.

18

Yes, Your Honor.

19

Yes.

So the -- the basic principle for which we're

20

advocating does not lie at the -- outside of the -- of

21

the definition of testimonial.

22

core proposition.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think it's simply a

And the people who are making

24

all these statements are -- are to be understood as

25

witnesses against somebody within the -- the language

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of the Confrontation Clause?

2

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think within the -- within

3

the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, if those

4

statements are allowed at proof -- as proof at trial

5

without the person coming in, then what we have

6

essentially done is created a system by which people

7

can create evidence for use by the legal system, by

8

engaging those statements without coming into court.

9

That's -- that's right.

10

And so I think one of the critical factors

11

here is to imagine what happens if statements, such as

12

the ones in -- in this case, are admitted -- are

13

admissible, and this Court holds -- holds that they

14

are, then basically they always can be admitted.

15

any State is free to create a system in which a

16

statement to a responding officer comes in as proof.

17

There's no need for the -- for the -- the declarant to

18

show up at trial, and there's no doubt that -- that

19

that is what would happen.

20

already adopted such statutes, and -- and my State of

21

Michigan is on the verge of doing so.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

as they are made reasonably freshly -- but they give a

the theory is that prosecutors say that these would be

regard this as a core category of testimonial

listed in Crawford.

to make it testimonial.

We do not propose that this categorical

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Such as in Crawford, but

10

in Crawford, it was the kind of formal statement, the

examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was

statements.

Certainly not the totality,

5

and if you say, well, this statement was informal, it

-- it doesn't make sense and I think it conflicts with

7

a comment in Crawford in footnote 3 to say, well,

8

informal testimony is -- is okay, as the Court said in

9

-- in Crawford.

If -- if sworn out-of-court testimony

10

is invalid, it wouldn't make sense to say that unsworn

11

testimonial statements are perfectly okay.

12

Now, so far as the principle that -- that

13

because the witness is under agitation, the -- the

14

Confrontation Clause doesn't -- doesn't apply, I don't

15

think that's -- that's valid at -- at all.

16

certainly isn't valid historically.

17

we would have seen examples over history in which

18

agitated declarants -- their statements came in.

19

as -- as General Dreeben has indicated, the very -- the

20

very organizing principle of prosecution was that the

21

accuser must come and -- come and testify.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It

If -- if it were,

Did the legislatures that

23

have passed laws of the kind you describe have before

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But in

Well, you -- you have to

19

assume not only that the victim is unwilling or

20

reluctant to testify, you have to assume that the

21

victim has disappeared because the victim, unwilling or

22

not, could be subpoenaed.

23

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Isn't that right?
The -- the victim could be

24

subpoenaed, and in -- in this case, as in Davis, the

25

victim was subpoenaed, but subpoenas have to be

subpoenas.

And -- and I think in some cases the

It's what the Cook County --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right, but I'm saying the scope

of the problem is -- is much more narrow than what is

suggested by simply describing how often it is that the

Justice Scalia.

phenomenon of the last 14 years.

Amy Hammon's oral statements to Officer

Mooney arose in an emergency situation very similar to

evidence in secret with no intention of ever letting

Well, I think it's -- the -- the

officers are present, but in fact, what would happen if

the officers were to do nothing, which is one of the

choices that, I suppose, the officers had.

find out what was going on and address the situation,

situation.

that point told him the story of the argument that had

15

taken place and the resulting physical abuse.

We know that Amy Hammon at

Now, what we know from -- from the accusation

test that is put forth by -- by the petitioner is

18

that the reason that it doesn't apply apparently to all

19

statements to -- to police officers is that it must

20

somehow take account of the co-conspirator statement.

21

But we don't otherwise have any grounding of that test

22

in the history of the Confrontation Clause.

23

The test that we are proposing, the broader

24

test that we are proposing, the resemblance test, flows

25

directly from statements in Crawford suggesting

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that the way that we know what is testimonial and what

2

is not is by examining the lessons of history.

3

we're proposing is that in any particular context, if

4

the statement resembles one of those historical abuses

5

in the civil law tradition, then in that circumstance

6

it's testimonial.

7

What

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't -- isn't the problem,

though -- I mean, as Crawford said, those examples

defined the core.

They were the paradigms, but they

10

didn't purport to cover the whole ground.

11

to me that your argument is to turn the core into the

12

exclusive examples, in which case the Confrontation

13

Clause in the real world is never going to apply.

the -- you know, the -- the fact that -- that the State

4

could corrupt the -- the statement through the

interrogation.

6

I'm not sure that was the only concern.

I -- I think the Founders believed in a judicial

system, at least in criminal cases, where the person

has a right to cross examine his accuser.

fact that the -- I am -- I'll put it this way.

Whether the

I am quite sure that it would have been held

11

a violation of the Confrontation Clause if, as the

prior example I gave, someone wrote out an affidavit

13

and sent it directly to the court, no intervening

14

police interrogation at all, just wrote out an

15

affidavit from -- from France, mailed it to the court,

prohibited, and that's one of the classic forms of

eliciting these affidavits and in using pretrial

testimony.

are you going to draw the distinction between the

-- whether we have the resemblance test doesn't require

us to answer that question because I think that the

examination the Court would undertake would again --

MR. FISHER:

I think it's -- I think it is

very similar to the letter and -- and could well be

3

inadmissible, but I don't know that it's -- if the

4

Court adheres to the test that it set forth in

Crawford, that it's looking for forms of testimony that

were prohibited at common law, certainly that would not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A videotape -- a

videotape of a crime scene is admissible.
MR. FISHER:

Right?

I think that's -- that's right.

11

Now, if it's -- if you have a videotape of someone

12

that -- that's responding to an interrogation, that's

13

an entirely different thing.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. FISHER:

No.

But a videotape of a crime scene

16

again would be -- would be not testimonial.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But a tape recording

18

by the same person who videotaped the crime scene,

19

describing what he saw, you agree would be excluded.

MR. FISHER:

I think that there's a high

21

chance that could be -- be excluded.

call those abuses.

15

MR. FISHER:

As I

not simply in how they were created, but -- but then in

17

how they were later used.

18

talking about trying to -- to craft a rule in part that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why isn't the -- the

bright line that the Government asserts that this is a

to it.

recognize that what the -- what the prosecution did has

law.

21

Amy Hammon to come and testify and, obviously, showing

22

that they would have preferred the live testimony in

23

this case.

24
25

We have here the government issuing a subpoena to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was there -- was there any

showing at all of whether they made the police -- or

39
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the prosecutor made any effort to enforce the subpoena?

2

MR. FISHER:

There was no such effort, Your

3

Honor.

4

beyond the record just a little bit, what we -- what we

5

do know is that the case was continued one time because

6

Amy Hammon did not show up in response to a subpoena,

7

and that the second time, the -- the trial proceeded.

8

But there was no effort to send someone out to -- to

9

enforce it or to bring any sort of contempt sanction.

10

But, well, here, if I may be permitted to go

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, let's assume your --

11

you have here a woman who's sitting down in the kitchen

12

with the police officer, talks to the police officer,

13

and then signs an affidavit.

14

affidavit at that time?

15

MR. FISHER:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

Did she sign the

That's right, yes.
And that affidavit was not

admissible because it's an affidavit.

18

MR. FISHER:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Correct.
But the police officer who

20

testified to what she said and what he wrote down in

21

the affidavit that she signed, that does get in.

22

MR. FISHER:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Correct.
I -- I can't see why that

24

makes any sense at all.

25

testifying when she spoke and then signed the

2

she wasn't testifying, in which case both the affidavit

3

and the oral statement should be in.

4

can't see drawing the line between those two.

5

really seems very strange to me.

6

MR. FISHER:

I can't -- I
It

Well, I think whether you look

7

at it from her perspective or from the officer's

8

perspective, that something did change in the moment

9

between the oral statement and the affidavit.

10

If you look at it from -- from the officer's

11

perspective, once Amy Hammon disclosed to him what had

12

happened and -- and gave him information that he needed

13

to handle the situation, then he could go about

14

handling the situation.

15

to do that.

16

he was transitioning to -- less from an emergency mode

17

and more to an evidence-gathering mode.

18

He didn't need the affidavit

Once he turned to get the affidavit, he --

If you're -- if you are looking at it from

19

the standpoint of Amy Hammon, then at that point, when

20

-- when Officer Mooney is -- is in the house and has

21

her husband, you know, in another room and she's trying

22

to just describe what's going on so that she can be

23

protected, that's a far different mind set.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

it's a classic mixed motive case.

Well, but it's a -We don't know when

41
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the officer is sitting down with her and asking the

2

questions, whether his primary motive is to make sure

3

the guy doesn't come back or if his primary motive is

4

to help make the case against the guy.

5

MR. FISHER:

It's both.

Well, I think it's reasonable to

6

assume that officers, faced with an emergency

7

situation, are primarily going to be working for --

8

from a concern of safety, for their own and for others.

9

And so even if it is a mixed motive, I think that the

10

point is that particular circumstance, it's reasonable

11

to infer where there's an emergency -- ongoing

12

emergency, an ongoing immediate safety concern, that

13

safety and security are going to be the primary motive.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why does his motive matter?

I mean, the -- the issue is whether she is testifying,

16

whether she is a witness, and I don't see how that

17

changes when she tells him these things orally and when

18

she signs the affidavit afterwards.

19

she's testifying as to what events had occurred.

20

MR. FISHER:

It seems to me

Well, let me be clear that we're

21

not suggesting a subjective inquiry into the officer's

22

motive, but what we are saying is that whether a

23

statement is testimonial depends on whether the

24

government is -- is purely collecting evidence, making

25

someone undergo an interrogation, for example, or

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

whether they are performing tasks that really were not

2

part of -- of any type of police function at the

3

founding, which is sort of a community caretaking,

4

public safety function, so that by definition in

5

eliciting statements concerning the immediate safety

6

issue, the police officer could not have been engaged

7

in the kinds of abuses that gave rise --

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

minutes later, says I've heard what you said.

14

15

16

problem, we're going to have to say as to the second,

17

that is even if you don't have the formality, you see,

18

everything is the same, but not the formality.

19

how do we do that?

20
21

I'm imagining the woman saying, he's

Not.

MR. FISHER:

She's in tears.

That's

Then suddenly the officer, 5
Let's

I'm not sure if I'm following.

Not formality --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm making the distinction

23

you're making between she's in tears, excited utterance

24

or res gestae, around there, just what you were talking

25

about.

Now think of the second affidavit -- when he

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reduces it to writing.

2

clearly motive to testify, et cetera.

3

what Mr. Friedman pointed out is if we make it turn

4

solely on the formality, the piece of paper, the stamp,

5

et cetera, they'll just avoid that.

6

have to sweep into the second the circumstance where

7

everything is the same but the formality, and that's

8

where I have the difficulty.

9

MR. FISHER:

That's different, calmer,
Fine.

But now

So we're going to

Well, again, the -- the

10

difficult task of understanding the Confrontation

11

Clause is to figure out what limits there might be, and

12

-- and in Crawford, the methodology was what does

13

history tell us the Framers were concerned about.

14

certainly the formal affidavit was something that they

15

were very concerned about.

16

were not.

And

The less formal forms they

17

And certainly when it comes to something as

18

-- as recent, you know, relatively speaking, as -- as

19

the community caretaking function of the police, that

20

was in no way part of -- of the abuses that the Framers

21

were concerned about.

22

were to limit its decision to that part of the test,

23

resolving the other instances, according to the

24

resemblance test or -- or trying to figure out where to

25

draw that -- you know, that line, could come later,

And so I think even if the Court

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

consistent with its decision in this case.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But your answer, I take it,

3

assumes that the Framers had no concern with the

4

capacity of the court to test the -- the validity or

5

the truth of the statement.

6

MR. FISHER:

Well, I'm not entirely sure if

7

that's the case.

8

operating in a -- in a circumstance where -- where

9

hearsay rules were -- were part of trial process.

I mean, I -- of course, they were

10

Certainly also, to the extent that -- that a particular

11

procedure is -- is outrageous, the -- a due process

12

concern might arise, but --

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but -- no.

But I'm --

14

I'm not talking about outrageous circumstances in which

15

the -- the statement was taken.

16

capacity of the court, by whatever means, to test the

17

truth of that statement once it is placed before the

18

court.

19

Breyer to assume that that testing function was not

20

within the contemplation of the Framers.

21

I'm talking about the

And I understood your argument to Justice

MR. FISHER:

I think it was with respect to

22

-- to the abuses that -- testimony elicited through the

23

abuses that gave rise to the clause, the -- the common

24

-- or I'm sorry -- the civil law type abuses.

25

want to test that, but the concern --

They did

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that your -- your -- you

2

would then say they want a -- they want to test certain

3

-- in certain cases where they think there may have

4

been an abuse in the elicitation of the statement, but

5

if there is -- there is no reason to suspect that the

6

statement was taken under untoward circumstances, they

7

were not concerned to test its validity.

8
9
10

MR. FISHER:

I think that -- that that's

largely accurate, but they were dealing with, I think,
a rather set form.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR. FISHER:

But is that your position?

Well, yes, but -- but if I may

13

add a clarification, which is to say, the reason I

14

think that we could circumscribe affidavits, regardless

15

of whether the elicitation abuses are present, is

16

simply for ease of administration, that abuses known to

17

the Framers would have been arising in a circumstance

18

where there would have been those abuses, and -- and as

19

a form --

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Don't -- don't you think the

21

Framers were aware of the fact that although there were

22

law enforcement abuses, Raleigh's case and so on, there

23

were also abuses every day of the week on the part of

24

people who gave false testimony because they had

25

grudges against the defendant?

Do you think that was

46
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

totally out of the minds of the Framers so as to

2

support the distinction that -- that as a general rule

3

you were suggesting?

4

MR. FISHER:

We don't know exactly all of the

5

details that would have -- that they were

6

contemplating.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But why would -- why would

8

we impute that -- that unconcern to the Framers about

9

the -- the need to test statements which may very well

10

have -- have been given because of envy, grudge, and so

11

on?

12

MR. FISHER:

Because of -- of what we do know

13

and what Crawford said that we do know, which is that

14

we know that they were responding to things like

15

Raleigh's trial and to Stamp Act, you know,

16

enforcement, other --

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but doesn't -- doesn't

18

that get us back to the fact that those examples were

19

given in Crawford as paradigm examples, if, you know,

20

those were -- I think the word poor was used.

21

but Crawford was not limited to that, and if it's not

22

limited to that, why, in effect, does the -- does the

23

-- should we conclude that the concern of the clause

24

stops short of the self-interested witness even though

25

he didn't make an affidavit?

But --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FISHER:

Again, if I may be permitted to

2

finish.

3

is to look for known circumstances of abuse, about

4

which the Framers were concerned, and we don't have

5

that sort of historical evidence more generally.

1

information that he needed to resolve the emergency,

2

and what he was soliciting at that point --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I would suggest the reason

4

it was not admissible is it's very clear that the

that the defendant had a right to confront.

be a line-drawing question, but when you have a

21

situation like this one where you have an officer who's

22

just on the scene in the immediate wake of a -- of a

23

domestic dispute, he asks a single question, what

24

happened, in -- in circumstances in which he needed to

know the answer to that question to make sure he could

back-and-forth and give-and-take and trying to press

to need to draw.

The Confrontation Clause bars

21

situation is one in which we are not going to be able

22

to examine the individual motives of officers in every

23

case and individual declarants in every case.

And the -- the

24

What we are looking for is a categorical rule

25

that is going to capture the likely motivations in both

52
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

cases, and when you have emergency question, you're

2

likely dealing with the situation with -- both from the

3

officer's side and from the declarant's side, you're

4

going to be having people attempting to resolve an

5

immediate danger of harm.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you get -That -- that assumes -- this

7

-- your -- your focus on whether the -- you know, the

8

-- it's an interrogation or not -- it -- it assumes

9

that the only focus of the Confrontation Clause is on

10

prosecutorial abuse somehow.

11

Justice Souter was suggesting, I don't think that was

12

the exclusive --

13

MR. GORNSTEIN:

And -- and as -- as

No, we don't -- we don't

14

think that's the exclusive focus either, and we think

15

interrogation can capture both, too, that when you get

16

to the point of interrogation, what's happening with

17

the witness is getting an increasing understanding that

18

what this is being sought for is to build a case.

19

I think the biggest problem with the -- the

20

two rules that are proposed on the other side, that is,

21

the accusation rule and the reasonable anticipation

22

rule, is it captures within a -- these emergency

23

statements that really don't have -- fall within any

ordinary understanding of what testimony is.

Yet, under his rule --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, the Sixth

Amendment doesn't use the word testimony, does it?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

No, it does not.

But what

9

the Court said in Crawford was that the term witness

10

was referring to -- that people can make testimonial

11

statements --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And maybe that -- and

13

maybe you're not a witness when you make the call, but

14

when that same call is admitted into court, then --

15

then it strikes me that you are a witness.

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But -- but that's not the

17

definition of witness that -- that Crawford adopted.

18

That would be --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As it happens in the other

20

-- in the companion case today, the prosecution itself,

21

in its summation to the jury, referred to the 911 call

22

and said, you have heard the testimony of -- of the

23

victim and referred to it as testimony.

24

MR. GORNSTEIN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Justice Scalia, if he -I mean, it's not beyond the

MR. GORNSTEIN:

a statement about a co-conspirator's statement during

the course of the conspiracy and he had said, we have

12

13

something better, it's a 911 call --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

16
17

And if it -- the prosecutor in the 911

-- of a cry for help, that

wouldn't make it not testimony.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

And I don't think --

Mr. Gornstein, is this a

18

fair summary of your position, if I may?

19

asking who's the witness that's being testified

20

against, and when it's the affidavit, it's clearly the

21

woman that's a witness there where it's inadmissible.

22

But your view, as I understand you, is when it's the

23

officer who is the witness, he's subject to cross

24

examination, and as long as the emergency continues and

25

he's describing what happened during the emergency,

We're really

MR. GORNSTEIN:

that she's not a witness during the emergency period

15

itself.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand what you're

saying.

18

MR. GORNSTEIN:

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It has to be both.
That we focus not on

20

whether it's testimony but whether he's the witness at

21

the critical time or whether she's the witness.

23

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I -- I think that that's one

way of looking at it, Justice Stevens, but -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

the Court looked at it in Crawford.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No.

I -- I think that what

2

you would look to see is if, at the relevant time, that

3

-- that the declarant was acting as a witness.

4

the relevant time, when somebody is answering a

5

question to avert an immediate danger, they're not

6

acting as a witness.

7

8

a prosecution, and so they're not acting as a witness

9

in those circumstances.

And at

They're not making a solemn

10

And -- and it's only later, when the officer

11

turns to soliciting from Ms. Hammon an affidavit, that

12

what he's soliciting at that point is a solemn

13

declaration made for the purpose of proving facts to

14

support a prosecution.

15

Now, that's testimony.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure that the two

16

were -- were as separated as you -- as you claim.

17

I took it that the affidavit -- while he was getting

18

the oral responses, he was writing down what -- what

19

would be put in the affidavit.

20

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I --

I don't think that there's

21

any evidence in the record to support that, Justice

22

Scalia.

23

-- that he listened to her oral statement and then he

24

proceeded to ask for -- her for an affidavit, after he

25

had the information that he needed to resolve the

2

protect this person from an immediate renewed attack if

3

he left the scene.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But under your test, the

5

whole question is whether the emergency continued at

6

the time the witness' words are being repeated.

7

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It's not the whole question

8

because if the statement -- the question has nothing to

9

do with and the answer had nothing to do with the

12

It does not come in under the rule we're

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, I'm not arguing that.

13

I'm trying to figure out -- I think I have a little

14

different angle on it than you actually said in your

15

brief or actually in the text of Crawford.

16

Crawford wasn't confronting this problem.

everything as testimonial, but the real question is

18

who's the witness under the text of the Constitution.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I -- I think that whenever

12

there is a -- an out-of-court accusation repeated,

13

there is a witness in court, but that is not the

14

witness that -- or that doesn't satisfy the

15

confrontation right because there's the -- the --

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but you would agree

17

that the officer could testify to some of the things

18

that happened during the emergency, and he's a witness

19

to that extent.

20
21

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, absolutely, the officer

was --

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23

he can cover this as well.

24
25

MR. FRIEDMAN:

And the question is whether

That's -- that, of course, is

acting as a -- a witness when -- when she made the

2

accusation to -- to the officer, and characterizing it

3

as an emergency I don't think helps anything in -- in

4

this case.

5

The -- the fact is that if we extend the

6

emergency this far it shows -- well, it shows just how

7

capable of expansion the -- the theory is because there

8

is an officer with her and there is an officer with --

9

with him.

So the -- the only question is should the

10

officers leave.

11

there's a victim potentially at large there, the

12

confrontation right wouldn't -- wouldn't apply.

13

That means that whenever there's --

The -- the whole emergency doctrine really

14

distorts incentives because a -- a police officer who

15

has a -- a dual motive of creating -- of protecting

16

people, protecting the safety of -- of people and

17

gathering evidence -- and I think it's clear that they

18

do -- under an emergency doctrine, would have an

19

incentive to preserve the emergency or the appearance

20

of emergency for -- for as long as -- for as long as

21

possible.

22

people to call, which of course they should do, but in

23

part the reason why people are encouraged to call is to

10

emergency doctrine simply -- simply can't -- if -- if

11

there were an emergency doctrine, I think it's just

12

badly founded and couldn't apply here.

13

If it please the Court, I believe Crawford

14

has brought us to a remarkable crossroads.

15

accusation in this case is allowed to secure a

16

conviction without the State providing an opportunity

17

for confrontation, then the Confrontation Clause will

18

be little more than a charade, easily evated by State

19

officers gathering evidence.

20

proclaims that a conviction cannot be based on an

21

accusation made privately to a known police officer,

22

then it will take a long step to ensure that the

23

confrontation right remains robust, as the Framers

24

intended for centuries to come.
