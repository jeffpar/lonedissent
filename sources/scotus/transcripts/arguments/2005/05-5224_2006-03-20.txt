ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Michelle McCottry's statements here were

11

testimonial for the simple reason that she knowingly

12

told a governmental agent associated with law

13

enforcement that someone had committed a crime.

14

Prosecutions based on such ex parte statements in place

15

of live testimony strike at the very heart of the evil

16

the Confrontation Clause is designed to prevent:

17

trials on the basis of out-of-court accusations.

18

Indeed, the trial here really can't be

19

described as anything other than inquisitorial in

20

nature.

21

McCottry's house and assaulted her that day was the 4

22

minute, tape-recorded 911 police incident interview

23

that the State played at Mr. Davis' trial and that it

24

itself described as Ms. McCottry's testimony on the day

25

this happened.

The sole proof that Mr. Davis was at Ms.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

Counsel, when you say -How does the fact that it's

sole proof mean that it's testimonial?

4

MR. FISHER:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It -I -- it -- it adds to the

6

general appeal of your case I -- I suppose, but what

7

does that have to do with whether or not it's

8

testimonial?

9

MR. FISHER:

It doesn't -- it doesn't answer

10

one way or another whether it's testimonial.

11

does and what I'm trying to do for this Court is,

12

first, draw back the lens for a moment and look at the

13

kind of trial that we end up with when statements of

14

the -- like fresh accusations in this case, are able to

15

be used in place of live testimony.

20

initiated by the caller, by the victim, and it's

22

This is not a magistrate judge or a police

MR. FISHER:

This is

Let -- let me address that

23

question in two parts.

24

mentioned, Justice Ginsburg, is whether it matters that

25

the -- that the operator is not a police officer, and

The first part you've

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, I didn't say that.

I'm sorry.
I said that the call was

5

initiated by the victim.

6

officer coming to interview her.

7

MR. FISHER:

It wasn't a -- a police

I see.

Well, we don't believe,

8

under the proper conception of the Confrontation

9

Clause, it matters who the accusatory statement is

10

initiated by.

11

Clause should apply if Ms. McCottry had simply walked

12

out of her house and walked down the street to the

13

police station and voluntarily walked into the

14

sheriff's office and said, I want to report what Mr.

15

Davis just did.

16

is there's no difference if she simply calls on the

17

telephone to a 911 operator, which the State itself in

18

its brief calls a conduit to the police, and so when

19

the -- when the police and when the State have set up a

20

system for people to report calls more expeditiously --

21

I'm sorry -- report crimes more expeditiously, we don't

22

think the answer is any different.

23

Certainly we believe the Confrontation

What we -- what we suggest here today

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You're splitting up two

24

things that I think go together.

25

just a call.

That is, this is not

This is a cry for help.

MR. FISHER:

Well, there -- in -- in a sense,

2

of course, Ms. McCottry is seeking help at the same

3

time she's reporting a crime, but the -- the mere fact

4

that the two are intertwined does not take us outside

5

the Confrontation Clause.

6

case that you're going to hear, you're going to hear

7

the same thing, that the person is asking for help in

8

the same way.

9

might call a mixed motive or a dual purpose call, the

Of course, in the Indiana

So when somebody makes a call, which we

10

question that we think this Court should ask is whether

11

-- whether that's the kind of a statement, first of

12

all, that historically would have been viewed as

13

implicating the Confrontation Clause.

14

at the hue -- the old hue and cry practice that we've

15

referred to in our briefs, Sir Matthew Hale in his

16

treatise explains that when somebody went and got the

17

local constable, what they were doing is they were

18

seeking help, first and foremost, to apprehend a felon,

19

and more than that, they were also reporting the crime

20

in the first instance.

21
22

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if you look

Is it your argument that any

statement made to law enforcement is testimonial?

23

MR. FISHER:

Well, you certainly don't have

24

to go that far in this case, Your Honor, but -- but we

25

believe --

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought that's what you

said in your argument when you started off.

3

MR. FISHER:

Certainly any statement

4

describing criminal activity to a law enforcement

5

officer would be testimonial.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you started out by

7

saying that the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was

8

to keep out the accusations made out of court, but I

9

would have thought that was the purpose of the hearsay

10

rule.

11

how does the Confrontation Clause differ?

And if that's the purpose of the hearsay rule,

12

MR. FISHER:

The purpose of the hearsay rule,

13

Justice Breyer, is to police the reliability of out-of

14

court statements.

15

the Confrontation Clause is something much different.

16

It regulates the manner of taking testimony in criminal

17

trials.

18

What this Court said in Crawford is

JUSTICE BREYER:

Ah, so it's not the purpose

19

of the Confrontation Clause to keep out out-of-court

20

accusations.

21

rule?

22

Only some, and which, and what's the

MR. FISHER:

Well, we believe the rule is, is

23

that any accusatory statement to a law enforcement

24

officer or to an agent of the law -- of law enforcement

25

--

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know you do believe that,

2

but I want to know why in terms of the purposes of not

3

the hearsay --

4

MR. FISHER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. FISHER:

Well, the --- rather the confrontation.

-- the history of the

7

confrontation right, going back even prior to the

8

framer, was to bring the accuser and the accused face

9

to face so that the accuser made his or her accusation

10

in the presence of the accused and subject to cross

11

examination.

12

Clause, which this Court has said itself over and over

13

again is to require the accuser to -- to deliver the

14

accusation in court, and so accusatory statements,

15

those that say he did it, this is what happened, this

16

is what I saw, are different than ordinary hearsay.

17

And -- and I -- to take an example from -- that we

18

talked about in the Crawford argument, Justice Breyer,

19

when somebody says pass the -- pass the pewter urn from

20

the mantle, that's where Bob keeps the drugs, that's

21

the kind of a statement that is very different than

22

pointing the finger at somebody to a law enforcement

23

agent.

24
25

And the very heart of the Confrontation

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Suppose I point the finger

in an affidavit, and I just send the affidavit, you

the case, not to a law enforcement officer, to the

I sign my name.

I'm in a

Absolutely, Justice Scalia, I -So your -- your thesis that

it applies to just accusatory statements to a law
enforcement officer has to be expanded a little.

11

MR. FISHER:

It does, and what I'm giving you

12

is a -- a rule that I think is the kernel, the heart of

13

the confrontation right.

14

more than that if it's --

15

She yells at the next-door neighbor, he's trying to

21

22

It's to the next-door neighbor, but the law enforcement

23

officer overhears it.

24

MR. FISHER:

2

Court's Bourjaily decision, which it cited with

3

approval in Crawford, is if somebody make -- if

4

somebody makes statements that tend out -- that turn

5

out to be incriminating in a criminal case, the mere

6

fact that they're overheard by law enforcement officers

7

or even an undercover officer eliciting the statement

is in a different scenario, Mr. Chief Justice, than

Did she want the police to come over and arrest her

What did she -- what did she want?

tantamount to a call for arrest.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You said -- you said we

13

don't know, but you -- that's slightly in conflict with

14

what you said earlier.

15

long was this telephone conversation between the 911

operator and the victim?

MR. FISHER:

They asked 26 questions.

How

18

Ginsburg.

19

course, we've given you in the joint appendix the

20

structured protocol that the 911 operator was following

in this case, and we submit that it's not mere

22

happenstance that the 911 call was able to establish

23

every element of the crime, right down to Mr. Davis'

birth date that the prosecutor referred to in her

Ms. McCottry.

And, indeed, the only question --

3

was -- I thought that was to determine if there were

outstanding orders and warrants against the individual.

MR. FISHER:

It may be, and that may be

But that's related --

8

that's related to sending people to prevent crime as

9

opposed to gathering evidence to be used to convict.

10

MR. FISHER:

I don't want to dispute that 911

11

operators in this situation, just like responding

12

officers, are gathering information for dual purposes.

13

They may well be trying to resolve an ongoing threat

14

of a felon at large.

15

of the information and training manuals that we've

16

provided to you in the reply brief make it clear that

17

from the initial contact with the alleged victim, they

18

are gathering evidence all the while.

At the same time, of course, all

19

And in fact, the only thing you can think of

20

-- at least, I can't think of a single question that a

21

prosecutor might have asked at a trial that the 911

22

operator didn't ask here.

23

really immediately come to mind are ones that might

24

have been asked in cross examination.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

The only questions that

question -- what if a 911 caller says nothing more

2

than, in a very excited way, someone is attacking me,

3

send a police officer right away to make the person

4

stop attacking me?

5

Is that testimonial?

MR. FISHER:

To the extent that the person is

6

saying someone is attacking me, that kernel may -- may

7

well be testimonial, Justice Alito.

8

somebody calls 911 and says, please send help to 911

9

Main -- or 3312 Main Street, that may well not be

However, if

10

testimonial.

11

this goes to Justice Ginsburg's question as well.

12

simple cry for help may -- may not be testimonial.

13

And that -- a mere cry for help -- and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

A

But a simple cry for help

14

that doesn't say I'm being battered may not elicit an

15

immediate response on the part of the police.

16

kind of call, I need help now, and the information that

17

comes with it is likely to be given priority attention

18

as this very call was.

19

MR. FISHER:

This

I think that's a fair inference,

20

but the -- the priority attention, in terms of going

21

and apprehending Mr. Davis, is exactly what triggers

22

criminal justice system and exactly what makes the kind

23

of a statement, the one that the -- one that the

24

Confrontation Clause should care about.

view that you really ought not be looking or focusing

get into these knotty questions of what exactly were

21

they trying to accomplish.

-- a better default than -- if you can't simply answer

Well, in doing that, do you

3

distinguish, for example, between the -- the

4

expectation that lies behind a merely excited

5

utterance, on the one hand, and the expectation or lack

of expectation that would qualify -- that would be the

strict sense?

on your view under the Confrontation Clause.

14

if in the course of the 911 call, Adrian was battering

15

the -- the -- you know, the victim over the head with

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

it can be important to distinguish between a modern-day

2

excited utterance and what would have been considered a

3

res gestae type statement at common law.

4

Certainly if you take away the 911 call from

5

your hypothetical and she says, please don't hurt me,

6

Adrian, that may well be the kind of a statement that

would be inside the res gestae.

question is there would be no distinction between the

15

MR. FISHER:

We believe that as long as it is

making a report to a third party, there ought not be a

distinction.

18

with that in this case because --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we think the fair -That --

1

MR. FISHER:

It's not exactly on all fours

2

with this case, but we think the fair inference, when

3

you read the treatises and the reasons why those kinds

4

of statements were kept out, is that if they simply --

5

if the police or their agents were able to get the

6

statement just a little bit sooner, the answer would

7

have been the same.

8
9

And we do have cases, Justice Scalia, where
people made fresh accusations or cry-outs to private

10

parties to -- to another -- to a witness who wasn't

11

even associated with law enforcement, and we have a

12

whole section of our brief pointing out that for

13

decades after the founding, even those kinds of

14

statements were kept out of evidence in criminal trials

15

for the reason --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

the Confrontation Clause you think?

18

MR. FISHER:

Because of the -- because of

Well, I -- I think it's a fair

19

inference, Justice Scalia, from reading the historical

20

precedent and the treatises that describe it.

21

they describe these as, in -- in a sense, second-class

22

testimony.

23

this, if they're made even seconds after the event in

24

place, is that they're -- at that point they're nothing

25

more than a narrative and require us to give credit to

They --

They say the problem with statements like

18
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a statement -- and this is the words the treatise

2

writers used to use -- that was not given under the

3

ordinary tests for determining the accuracy of

4

testimony.

5

and they talk about the usual tests and the customary

6

way of testing out-of-court statements, I think the

7

fair inference is they're referring to the right to

8

confrontation.

9

And when they used the word like testimony

Perhaps another way to think about this is to

10

take a step back and say, what if we decide that

11

statements like this are not testimonial?

12

practical -- the practical impact of that is not simply

13

that these statements won't -- will come in, but that

14

prosecutors and -- prosecutors, Federal and State

15

government, will have no incentive whatsoever to ever

16

bring 911 callers into court.

17

State hearsay law across the country, these are deemed

18

excited utterances.

19

The

It -- it is -- across

So if this Court were to say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's not --

20

that's not true at all.

21

witness may be a good witness and compelling on the

22

stand, they may have every incentive to bring her in in

23

person.

24

the witness is unwilling or unable to testify.

25

I mean, if -- if the -- the

This is only addressed to the situations where

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think you

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

got to the heart of the matter when you said that if

2

it's a good witness, the prosecutor will put them on.

3

The flip side of that is that if the witness isn't so

4

good, the prosecutor would have every incentive at

5

least not to put them on the stand.

6

put on a stand -- put somebody on a stand that doesn't

7

seem perhaps credible or maybe subject to impeachment

8

when they have, in a sense, testimony in a sealed tape

9

recorder already?

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why would somebody

Well, I assume the defendant

11

could summon that -- that witness if -- if that

12

witness' location was known.

13

MR. FISHER:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

No?

Well, the defendant -And could find out from the

prosecution where that witness was, I assume.

16

MR. FISHER:

The defendant might be able to

17

do that.

18

case this way would collapse the confrontation right

19

into the Compulsory Process Clause.

20

right is a right not to be able to bring witnesses into

21

court.

22

against --

23

But, of course, that would -- treating the

The confrontation

It's to be confronted with the witnesses

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But Justice Scalia's

24

question raises the -- the point.

have, the particular domestic abuse situation.

3

not the government that is keeping these witnesses out.

4
5

It's -- it's the concern they
It's

They're not relying on the 911 calls as a matter of
preference.

6

MR. FISHER:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

7

your assumption may not be entirely correct.

8

-- there's a portion from, for example, the San Diego

9

prosecutor's office decided, and I believe in the NACDL

There's a

10

brief, that says oftentimes they do prefer to -- to

11

leave the witness off the stand because they have a

12

better case just using the -- the excited utterance

13

type statements.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there -- is there --

15

suppose the defendant procured the witness' absence by

16

a threat.

17

MR. FISHER:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19
20

could come in.

Yes.
Then the 911 statement

Right?

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

That's right.

21

And perhaps -- and this gets back to the Chief

22

Justice's question as well.

23

these kinds of cases into three categories.

24
25

It helps maybe to separate

We first have the category that the
prosecution would prefer not to put the person on the

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

stand.

2

to require them to do so.

We think there the Confrontation Clause ought

3

We -- we next have the category where the

4

defendant, as you say, procures the witness' absence.

5

We don't dispute that in that scenario the forfeiture

6

doctrine kicks in, which this Court reaffirmed in

7

Crawford.

8

this case.

9

We don't have any forfeiture question in

And then we have perhaps the gray area, where

10

a witness goes missing through no fault of anybody's,

11

and this Court has said over and over again that there

12

the confrontation right puts the onus onto the

13

prosecution.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But those are -- those are

15

three neat legal categories.

16

it not so, is that many women in these situations are

17

scared to death of what will happen to them or they're

18

so insecure financially that they think they have to

19

put up with the battering?

20

categories really don't conform to what happens in

21

people's lives who are in this situation.

22

MR. FISHER:

The practical reality, is

So your neat legal

Justice Ginsburg, I don't want

23

to be insensitive to -- to witnesses in this situation.

24

Of course, reluctant witnesses is nothing new, but --

25

but in domestic violence, it's an acute problem.

22
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

However, we believe the proper way to deal

2

with that situation is by this Court developing its

3

forfeiture doctrine.

4

across the board to all criminal cases, Justice

5

Ginsburg, and we've cited, for example, in the appendix

6

to our reply brief about 30 cases from the last couple

7

years that have been handled in a victimless fashion

8

like this that are not domestic violence cases --

9
10

The Sixth Amendment applies

JUSTICE BREYER:

How would you do that?

How

would you do that forfeiture?

11

MR. FISHER:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Pardon me?
How would you do that?

I'm

13

interested in that because I thought it sounded good.

14

Then I thought about it.

15

you'd have to show that this defendant, in fact, forced

16

the wife not to testify.

17

you'd have to prove another crime against the defendant

18

in order to prove the first crime.

19

perhaps that doctrine is not very practical.

20

me why it is.

21

MR. FISHER:

I thought to have forfeiture,

It's a crime to do that.

So

And I thought
You tell

Well, that's already what

22

happens under the Federal Rules of Evidence and under

23

the evidence of many States, that there is a rule of

24

forfeiture by wrongdoing.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so -I understand that.

My point

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is that to prove the wrongdoing would probably be even

2

harder than to prove the original crime.

3

is the wife isn't there.

4

MR. FISHER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

All we know

I'm not -And we suspect that she's

6

afraid of her husband.

7

financial aid, said goodbye, no money, or he may have

8

done worse.

9

because the prosecution can prove that in court and

He may have offered to cut off

I'm just saying you're telling us that

10

only then will it be able to introduce the testimony

11

given beforehand by the missing wife.

12

MR. FISHER:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think -How does it work?

Well, I think we have -- Justice

15

Breyer, like in lots of other scenarios, you have a

16

pretrial hearing, and at that pretrial hearing, of

17

course, the rules of evidence don't strictly apply the

18

way they would in the guilt phase.

19

case, if you look at the joint appendix, when -- when

20

on the eve of trial Ms. McCottry is no longer going to

21

show up for trial, the prosecutor says, I want to

22

subpoena the jail records and I want to talk to the

23

victim's advocate to find out whether she's been

24

intimidated or kept away.

25

tells the court how she's going to look for this

So in this very

evidence.

2

would have presented it and she could have presented it

3

that way.

4

If she had found anything, presumably she

And it's -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe we should just -- just

5

suspend the Confrontation Clause in spousal abuse cases

6

instead of designing the entire application of the

7

Confrontation Clause everywhere on the basis of what

8

seems to be a special problem in spousal abuse cases.

9
10

MR. FISHER:

Well, of course, Justice Scalia,

the Sixth Amendment says all criminal prosecutions --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. FISHER:

13

I understand.

-- and domestic violence cases

are criminal prosecutions.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So we don't think -And I suppose we could also

15

have said that the Sixth Amendment, like some other

16

amendments, doesn't apply to State prosecutions --

17

MR. FISHER:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right, but we've --- or the Confrontation

19

Clause portion of it, anyway --

20

MR. FISHER:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
-- which would exempt spousal

22

abuse cases, by and large, until we -- until we enact a

23

Federal spousal abuse statute, which -- which may well

24

occur.

25

-- to solve this problem than to design the whole

It seems to me there -- there are better ways to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Confrontation Clause jurisprudence on the basis of what

2

happens in spousal abuse cases.

3

MR. FISHER:

4

And let -- let me say there are two -- there

I think that's a fair comment.

5

are many ways that you can do that, Justice Scalia, and

6

two of them were readily available to the State in this

7

case.

8

unwilling to testify in a hard case, there may well be

9

other ways to prove the case.

10
11

One is even when a witness goes missing or is

JUSTICE BREYER:

Here, the caller said --

This is true, but the reason

I thought spousal abuse cases are relevant --

12

MR. FISHER:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Pardon me?
A reason I thought they were

14

relevant is just what you're about to address.

15

evidentiary of the problem that exists when you bring

16

something within the Confrontation Clause.

17

Crawford, even though it was within the clause, if it

18

fell within a well-recognized exception to the hearsay

19

rule, it could come in.

20

conspirators before the conspiracy ended.

21

bring in, for sure, excited utterances.

22

bring in all kinds of things that now, no matter how

23

reliable, you have to keep them out.

24
25

MR. FISHER:

They're

Prior to

So you could bring in co
You could

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so that is a problem

2

that you have to address in respect to drawing a fairly

3

narrow line, and I want to know what that narrow line

4

is with spousal abuse and other cases in mind.

5

MR. FISHER:

Let me give you two ways this

6

case, if -- if we assume the State's version of

7

events is correct, could have easily been proved.

8
9

One is that the caller said that a man named
Mike was at her house during the entire event.

When

10

the police showed up at her house some 5 minutes later,

11

they never even got Mike's last name.

12

Justice Breyer, the reason why is because they were

13

probably thinking of the Roberts framework and that

14

they wouldn't need this witness, but good old-fashioned

15

police work would have presumably found a witness that

16

witnessed the whole event that they could have put on

17

the stand.

18

And, of course,

The second thing the State could have done in

19

this case is they could have filed the case in a way

20

that they obtained a preliminary hearing.

21

State says is correct that Ms. McCottry was cooperating

22

up until the last minute, that's a classic scenario

23

where, by way of having a preliminary hearing and

24

subjecting her to cross examination at the preliminary

25

hearing, they could have preserved her testimony.

If what the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Court in California against Green and Roberts itself

2

said that those kinds of prior pretrial cross

3

examination scenarios are good enough to satisfy the

4

Confrontation Clause.

5
6

And if the Court has no further questions,
I'll reserve the remainder of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. WHISMAN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13

MR. WHISMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

14

In this 911 call, the operator asked a short

15

series of questions, nearly all phrased in the present

16

tense.

17

necessary to respond to an apparent emergency.

18

Each question was objectively and reasonably

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Like what is his name?

I

19

mean, that's the present tense.

20

or what will be his name.

What is his name?

21

that's the present tense.

So that shows that this is

22

all seeking help.

23

MR. WHISMAN:

Not what was his name
You think

No, a number of other

24

questions, Justice Scalia, were answered -- were asked

25

in the present -- present tense too.

And, in fact, the

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

operator, shortly after asking the first questions, one

2

of the first things that she said was help was on the

3

way and then continued with a series of questions.

4

as the interview continued, of course, every single

5

question and every single answer was captured on the

6

tape for a jury or a judge to later hear.

7

ended after the operator knew that Ms. McCottry had her

8

door locked, that Davis had left, and that the

9

officer's arrival was imminent.

10

The call

We ask -- respectfully ask this Court, under

11

these circumstances, to hold that the use of this

12

powerful evidence, without live testimony from the

13

declarant, was constitutionally permissible.

14

But

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know, powerful is part

15

of the problem.

16

evidence is even more powerful than -- than the kind of

17

a signed affidavit that used to be banned because it

18

was testimonial.

19

on the phone makes it, if it is -- if it is

20

impermissible under the Confrontation Clause, it makes

21

it even a more damaging violation than the kind of

22

violation that -- that occurred in -- in Sir Walter

23

Raleigh's case, for example.

24
25

This -- this kind of telephone call

I mean, to hear -- to hear the voice

MR. WHISMAN:

Well, I'd respectfully

disagree, Your Honor, although I'd -- I'd first note

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that -- that I think the if clause in Your Honor's

2

question is telling.

3

doesn't necessarily define whether it's testimonial or

4

not.

And I think if that -- that

But to address --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would you -- would you

6

rather put the woman on -- if you had a choice, would

7

you rather put the woman on the stand?

9

MR. WHISMAN:
and --

10
11

Absolutely, Your Honor, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Rather than have her -- her

voice on the telephone call --

12

MR. WHISMAN:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if I had to --- when she is -- she is in

14

-- in -- supposedly in great fear of -- of her husband

15

and -- and -- I'm sure you'd rather have the telephone

16

call.

17
18

MR. WHISMAN:

If you're asking me which would

I chose --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. WHISMAN:

As a prosecutor.

Well, if I had to chose, that

21

would be a difficult choice, obviously, but our plan,

22

of course, was to --

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think it would be an easy

choice.
MR. WHISMAN:

Our -- our plan was to do both,

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

and it wasn't until the eve of trial that we learned

2

that the complaining witness, Ms. McCottry, wasn't

3

going to appear.

4
5

And I think that the circumstances --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Did -- did you subpoena her

at that point?

6

MR. WHISMAN:

She was already subpoenaed,

7

Your Honor, and the prosecutor brought in the

8

detective.

9

attempts to get a hold of her, checked her last known

The detective attempt -- made numerous

10

address.

11

We had one phone number for her.

12

to the telephone calls pursuant to our calls to that

13

number.

14

documented in the record to get her to court, once we

15

learned that -- that she didn't appear.

The person there didn't know where she was.
She wasn't responding

So we made a number of efforts that are

16

Now, at that point --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, your -- your

18

position is not that anything that she says or anything

19

anyone says in a 911 call is -- is consistent with the

20

Confrontation Clause.

21

MR. WHISMAN:

That's right, Your Honor.

It's

22

conceivable that you could have statements made in the

23

course of a 911 call that wouldn't be testimonial.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
what is your test?

So what is your --

We have your friend saying any

accusatory statement made to a law enforcement officer.

2

What -- what is your proposal?

3

MR. WHISMAN:

Our focus, Your Honor, is, as I

4

think this Court focused in Crawford on whether or not

5

the government's practice resembles the inquisitorial

6

abuses.

7

sense, did you have a structured police interrogation

8

such that the interrogator or the questioner might have

9

in some way shaped the witness' testimony.

In other words, did you have -- in the modern

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Fisher tells us

11

that's exactly what happens, that the 911 operator goes

12

through the elements of the crime in a very structured

13

way.

14

MR. WHISMAN:

Well, I -- I think if you

15

listen to the tape itself, you'll conclude that's not

16

the case.

17

that the operator asked was reasonably and objectively

18

designed to facilitate a quick response and to solve

19

the emergency that was apparent.

20

I mean, in fact, each question that the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's -- let's not overread

21

Crawford.

22

Confrontation Clause was directed at was the kind of

23

abuse that -- that occurred in the case of Sir Walter

24

Raleigh.

25

which it was directed.

Crawford didn't say that the only thing the

It said that that was the principal abuse at
I doubt very much, unless you

32
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

think otherwise, that if somebody, without provocation

2

from the police, wrote up an affidavit, signed the

3

affidavit, and gave it to the police, I doubt whether

4

that would have been allowed under the Confrontation

5

Clause.

6

Do you think it would have?
MR. WHISMAN:

Well, it may not have, Your

7

Honor, but the -- under the test that we're proposing,

8

the -- we're placing the focus on situations like this,

9

situations roughly analogous -- situations that are

10

distinguishable from what you had with Sylvia Crawford.

11

And I think that although -- although our test may not

12

cover every conceivable hypothetical, I think that, as

13

this Court recognized in Crawford, defining testimonial

14

was going to be a -- a task that was going to take some

15

time, and --

16

example I just gave.

Oh, now the person disappears

MR. WHISMAN:

Fair enough.

But it's not an

impression.

9

would admit it, which is really what brings us back to

It's not a present sense

I can't imagine a hearsay exception that

the core of our theory, too, and that is that -- that

under the Confrontation Clause, as defined in Crawford,

12

we now have an absolute rule covering a finite --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I can't imagine that that

14

wouldn't have been covered by the Confrontation Clause

15

--

16

MR. WHISMAN:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well --- such -- such an obvious

18

violation of your right to confront your accuser, and

19

just because it was presented to the police without --

20

without an initial interrogation by the police, I don't

21

think that would have made any difference at common

22

law.

23

MR. WHISMAN:

And -- and, Your Honor, it may

24

be that at some point the Court expands the definition

25

in -- in Crawford of testimonial -- formalized

34
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

testimonial materials to include something like that,

2

but I think that in situations where you have an

3

encounter between police and citizen and statements

4

result, then I think it's fair to focus on the

5

interaction and whether or not the -- the person was

6

trying to shape the testimony.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I agree that that's the

8

extreme, but you're urging us to -- to adopt a test

9

that embraces only the extreme and does not embrace the

10

hypothetical I just gave you.

11

accept that hypothetical without saying that you lose

12

this case, but it seems to me the test you're proposing

13

is -- is really quite extreme.

14

MR. WHISMAN:

And you -- you can

Well, Your Honor, as I say, the

15

test we're proposing I think would cover the majority

16

of cases.

17

-- is -- is itself I think somewhat unusual.

18

do not get statements of that nature.

19

them being offered into evidence.

20

think that if -- if we saw cases like that, if we saw

21

statements that were admitted, there may be other ways

22

under the clause that the Court could interpret the

23

Confrontation Clause to exclude them.

24
25

The hypothetical that Your Honor posed was
We -- we

We do not see

And as I say, I

I'm not arguing for the admissibility of that
evidence.

Quite frankly, I've never in my life even

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

seen a piece of evidence like that offered.

2

saying is that I don't believe it falls under this

3

narrow definition of the Confrontation Clause that you

4

outlined in the Crawford case.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

All I'm

Why don't you incorporate

6

what the Solicitor General has suggested, that is, you

7

draw the line at urgent emergency statements that are

8

calling for -- for immediate help?

9

MR. WHISMAN:

We certainly don't have any

10

objections to the Solicitor General's approach, Your

11

Honor, and -- and in fact, in some ways, because we're

12

analyzing a case like this that arose in an emergency

13

circumstance, I think that it's clear that -- that

14

statements that are made in those circumstances, just

15

by their very nature, aren't going to be testimonial.

16

People don't testify in an emergency.

17

take that approach doctrinally just because we didn't

18

think it was as closely tied to the approach the Court

19

took in Crawford.

20

consistent with the strategy outlined by the Solicitor

21

General.

22

We chose not to

But I think it's certainly

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what do we do about

23

the -- about the fact, which I don't think you -- you

24

deny and -- and the -- the other side points out in

25

both of these cases that, in fact, police departments

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

have their responders to the 911 number intentionally

2

ask a series of questions that gives them all the

3

information they need to conduct a prosecution?

4

other words, they are using 911 as a -- as a

5

prosecutorial device.

6

MR. WHISMAN:

In

Well, I think that overstates

7

the empirical evidence, Your Honor.

8

you look at the training manual in this case that we

9

attached to our briefing in the Supreme Court and refer

I think that if

10

to our briefing, if you look at the way that this

11

interview was conducted, it's clear that these

12

operators are not, as a routine matter, using the 911

13

process to develop evidence.

14

In fact, in this case you'll note that --

15

that after the short 4-minute period, the operator

16

didn't say, well, stay on the line with me a little bit

17

more and let's talk about the background situation

18

here.

19

documented in the training materials from the Valley

20

Communications Center, said don't get caught up in the

21

background information that led to this event because

22

it can distract you in getting the information that

needs to be transferred to the police department right

24

away.

25

and really the -- the better approach for a 911

operator.

So even though -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

after the 4 minutes to call the police, or did she --

4

she have the police on the way after the first minute?

7
8

It sounds as though that she

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

She -- she's just typed

that out on the computer or something like that?

9

MR. WHISMAN:

That's right.

And, in fact,

10

there are some times when you can hear all three voices

11

on the 911 tape, not in this instance.

12

almost immediately after the call began, she said, help

13

is on the way, that's because you can dispatch but

14

still obtain information, for example, the date of

15

birth.

16

birth of the defendant and name, et cetera are

17

extremely important so that in those 4 minutes that it

18

-- coincidentally, it was also 4 minutes before the

19

police officer arrived -- they can be determining

20

whether or not the defendant has criminal history.

21

They can determine whether or not, from their records

22

available to them in their police car, whether or not the

23

defendant has a history of assaults against police

24

officers, whether or not he has a -- a history of

25

carrying weapons, et cetera.

But as I said,

And as Mr. Chief Justice indicated, date of

So that's all information

38
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that the operators are trained to -- to obtain and then

2

to transfer to the police as soon as possible.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And she's -- she's in

4

ongoing -- the operator is in ongoing contact with the

5

people she's -- the operator has dispatched.

6

MR. WHISMAN:

Right?

Correct, Your Honor, and that's

7

why -- that's why ordinarily the operator doesn't

8

terminate the call until the police have arrived on the

9

scene.

Here it appears that she terminated the call

10

somewhat contemporaneously with their arrival.

11

she indicates that the police are there and they'll

look around for him quickly and then come and check

her.

What do you have to say

about the failure to inquire about Mike?
MR. WHISMAN:

that's as significant as Petitioner suggests.

18

look at the record, in the pretrial testimony of

19

Officer Jones, he asked Ms. McCottry, upon arrival,

20

repeatedly did she know who this other person was, and

21

her answer was she didn't know the person's last name.

22

If you

The record isn't fully developed on that point, but it

23

sounds like that -- that Mike was a friend of the

24

defendant's.

25

the defendant.

And we know for sure that Mike left with

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

also came with the defendant, but we didn't have any

2

particular contact or handle on this person Mike.

3

And in fact, if it was a friend of the

4

defendant, you'd think that the Compulsory Process

5

Clause would have given the defendant some basis on

6

which to bring him before the court.

7

that that includes any of the -- that -- that doesn't

way it might if were to force him to bring the

declarant in.

13

I don't think

So I don't think it's as

Your Honor, I -- I do want to return for just

14

one moment to this notion that we don't want witnesses

15

to testify and that we are satisfied with proceeding

16

just on -- on the basis of other pieces of evidence.

17

At least in my practice and at least in our county,

18

that's definitely not true.

19

recanting witness in, for example, the domestic

20

violence abuse scenario -- situation, it is often just

21

as effective for us to go ahead and put -- put the

22

witness up on the stand, let her tell whatever story

23

she's presently telling, and then play the 911 -- 911

24

tape also in conjunction with the testimony of the

25

officers who can describe what -- what condition she

juxtapose the 911 tape, even with the recantation from

3

the witness, frankly sometimes the jurors find it even

4

more illuminating than -- than if she didn't appear.

5

So we do not spend our time trying to put together

6

cases purposely without the victim testifying.

7

so happens that sometimes, at the last minute like this

8

case, we're not able to bring the person in.

9

And I think when you

occurrence in any event.

we're not in a position whereby if we hold against you,

we are, in effect, nullifying the possibility of

enforcing domestic violence laws by criminal process.

15

MR. WHISMAN:

Well, I -- I think the other

16

factor that has to be considered, Your Honor, is as soon

17

-- as soon as defendants realize that merely pressuring

the victim into not appearing will put an end to the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

6

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

7
8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A panic-stricken call for help, which can

10

occur on a 911 call, is not a form of bearing witness

11

within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause that

12

activates the rule in Crawford.

13

statements that are made to 911 operators and to

14

officers at the scene investigating an urgent need to

15

protect a person's safety, do not resemble the classic

16

forms of testimonial evidence that were generated under

17

the Marian statutes and the civil law practice that

18

formed the impetus for the Confrontation Clause.

19

three significant respects, statements that are made in

20

emergency questioning differ from the kind of testimony

21

that prompted the rule in Crawford and the

22

confrontation right that it rests on.

23

Emergency statements,

In

First of all, in the classic examples of

24

someone giving testimony, which this Court noted means

25

a solemn declaration or affirmation for the purpose of

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

proving a fact, people who are on 911 calls or seeking

2

help at the scene of an -- an urgent situation are not

3

making statements for the purpose of providing evidence

4

in a case.

5

of obtaining help, and that distinguishes them

6

significantly from the kinds of subtle desires to shape

7

and influence their statements that occur --

8
9

They are making statements for the purpose

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, maybe.

I mean,

it's easy to imagine a 911 call that doesn't fit your

description.

11

12

time.

I keep calling and I've talked to you about

13

this.

You don't do anything.

14

so this will stop.

15

more like testimony than an immediate call for help.

16

You know, the person is trying to get in

The call is -- you know, this is the fourth

He's got to be locked up

I mean, that's not -- that sounds

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, we would

17

distinguish between those kinds of 911 calls where

18

someone is seeking protection from an imminent or

19

present threat to their safety and a 911 call that's

20

making a more generalized report of criminal activity

21

or a desire for safety and maybe speaking in a

22

narrative form about the past.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the husband had left

24

the house here, as I understand it, when this -- when

25

this call occurred.

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DREEBEN:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3
4

Actually, Justice -She -- she wanted the man

arrested, but he was no longer in the house, was he?
MR. DREEBEN:

Actually, Justice Scalia, I

5

believe when the call begins, the caller is speaking in

6

the present tense and says, he's here jumping on me

7

again. And the 911 operator then begins to elicit

8

information to find out what is the level of the threat

9

to her safety and what actions need to be taken and

10

says, okay, I've got help started.

Help is on the way.

11

Now, tell me what his name is, and she -- the -- the

12

caller tells what the name is of the defendant and, at

13

that point, says, he's running now.

14

after critical information is imparted at the beginning

15

of the call that the caller says that he's leaving.

16

But even --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so, it's only

And then what -- what's your

18

position if she says he beat me 2 minutes ago, he's

19

left, and he's running down the block?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

I think in that situation,

21

Justice Kennedy, there is still an imminent threatened

22

potential of a recurrence.

23

The person could come back.

There's no protection on the scene.

The reason that

24

she's calling 911 and not a friend or -- or a health

25

care provider is that she believes she needs protection

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

right then.

2

such that it exerts a pressure both on the person who

3

is seeking help, as well as the official responder from

4

the government, to solve that urgent problem.

5

evidentiary benefit that may come from that is really

6

an incidental --

7

And the -- the nature of an emergency is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Any

Well, suppose -- suppose

8

it's a thief, and she said he's taken the diamond

11

not fall within the emergency rule that the Government

13

is arguing for today.

14

that deals when people's safety is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What we're arguing for is a rule

So the -- the jewelry store

16

owner who reports to the -- the police is fleeing on a

17

911, that -- that's not -- that's not admissible under

your view?

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

I'm not saying that,

20

Justice Kennedy.

21

confronted in this case with a situation in which

22

threats not to the person but to property or the need

23

to obtain or try to apprehend a fleeing felon are

24

present.

25

I'm saying that the Court isn't

MR. DREEBEN:

We would submit that that is

3

not testimonial within the meaning of Crawford for many

4

of the same reasons that -- that are present in this

5

case.

6

But it is a different case from this.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

What do you mean by seeking

7

help?

8

help means trying to get somebody arrested, trying to

9

get somebody who has harmed you arrested.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

She had gone and

Well -And -- and in the -- in the

15

jeweler case, the guy is running down the street.

16

is the jeweler -- is the jeweler really worried about

17

the guy turning around and coming back to rob some

18

more?

19

What

He wants the man arrested.
MR. DREEBEN:

The urgency certainly in -- in

20

the jewelry thief hypothetical does deal with

21

apprehending the person who has just stolen the goods.

22

And that's why I say that it falls outside of the rule

23

that the Government is arguing for today.

24

But, Justice Scalia, I think --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I'm concerned about the

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

rule you're arguing today because it -- it seems to me

2

there's a good case for allowing the -- the statement

3

by the jewelry store operator.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think there is a good -And -- and I want to know

6

what your position is so that you don't come back next

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I'm not going to say that

we wouldn't, depending on how the Court analyzes this
case, argue for a submission that that's not -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We'd rather you analyze

the case now and then we'll analyze it later.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. DREEBEN:

What the Court needs to analyze

15

today is whether an emergency statement where somebody

16

is seeking protection and there is a threat of imminent

17

recurrence of the very violence that has triggered the

18

call is testimony.

19

sort of risks of government shaping and the declarant

20

focus on providing evidence for use in a criminal case

21

are not present, and the information has, as Justice

22

Scalia pointed out, a unique probative value that's

23

very different from the kind of submission of an

24

affidavit or submitting to a civil law deposition that

25

prompted the confrontation right.

And it's not testimony because the

48
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

The Framers were thinking about things that

2

we all would recognize as testimony, being deposed,

3

submitting an affidavit, appearing before a -- a

4

magistrate in a pretrial proceeding, and they used the

5

word witness in the Confrontation Clause not only to

6

refer to the kinds of statements that were covered, but

7

in connection with knowledge that the same word appears

8

in the Fifth Amendment and in the Sixth Amendment

9

Compulsory Process Clause, where in all of those

10

contexts, its most natural application is to the formal

11

acquisition of evidence.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you say in that

13

respect about the blue brief's reference to 17th

14

century cases, the hue and the cry where someone went

15

out and told the sheriff, help, I'm being beaten up,

16

and that that evidence wasn't admissible?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think what's really

18

striking, Justice Breyer, is that there is no 17th

19

century case law that reflects that.

20

virtual, complete absence on the other side of this

21

case of an affirmative argument supported by decided

22

cases that says that evidence of that character was

23

even known to the Framers, let alone excluded.

24
25

There's really a

If you look closely at their constable cases,
which is the closest cases that they -- they submit,

49
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

one of them is a report from the Old Bailey online

2

source which contains transcripts of criminal trials in

3

-- in England, and one of them, the Radbourne case, is

4

right around the time of the framing, and there's a

5

little line in the transcript where the constable says,

6

well, I bent down and I asked the victim something and

7

then the judge says, well, don't say that.

8

evidence that that was regarded as a -- a legal ruling

9

under confrontation principles.

There's no

There's no evidence

10

that the Framers were aware of the Radbourne Old

11

Bailey report, and there's additional statutory basis

12

in the treason statute, which was applicable there,

13

which said that all evidence had to be given face to

14

face.

So that's their primary authority.

15

Their next authority --

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't have

22

admitted, and there were a lot of them.

MR. DREEBEN:

They -- they

The hue and cry reports,

Justice Scalia, as I think your earlier questioning

suggested, do not necessarily involve the kind of

2

emergency situation what -- that we have here where a

3

person is reaching out from an ongoing present criminal

4

act against them and seeking help.

5

we have very little evidence at all of how 17th century

6

British law handled this is really, I think, persuasive

7

evidence that the Court should not deem the

8

confrontation right as a response to some sort of

9

abuses in this area.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the fact that

I would say that a hue and

11

cry report is not the same as a woman being beaten and

12

-- and picking up the phone while the crime is in

13

progress.

14

jewelry hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you

15

which you're unwilling to say is -- is not covered by

16

the -- is covered by the Confrontation Clause, and I

17

think it's quite similar to a woman, where the husband

18

has left and she's locked the door and she wants the

19

husband arrested.

But I think it's quite similar to the -- the

I think it's quite similar to that.

20

But for the telephone, it's -- it's someone who's been

21

the victim of a crime who goes to a public official, as

22

soon as possible, and says, I've been -- I've been

23

subject to a crime.

24

have the person arrested.

25

I want to report the crime and

MR. DREEBEN:

I think it's very similar.

Justice Scalia, first of all,

51
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there is evidence that the hue and cry practice

2

existed.

3

reports were viewed as a matter of evidence law.

4

very difficult to transpose into 17th and 18th century

5

English practice what we are dealing with now, in part

6

because the system of public prosecutions that we have

7

today where an official prosecutor representing the

8

State carries the ball in a criminal case did not

9

exist.

There is not evidence about how hue and cry
It is

The accuser had to appear in court as the

10

private prosecutor.

11

there was no prosecution, and these prosecutions were

12

simply dismissed because there was no one official on

13

the scene to carry the ball.

14

that's required requires a number of inferential leaps

15

that Petitioners have to make in order to draw an

16

analogy.

17

If the accuser did not appear,

So the -- the speculation

And at the same time, there really is an

18

intuitive difference between the kinds of statements

19

that people make in emergencies and the kind of core

20

testimonial statements that we know prompted the

21

confrontation right, the Sir Walter Raleigh case

22

involving affidavits and letters, the Marian practice

23

under which testimony was formally taken in the calm of

24

a magistrate's rooming house rather than in the

25

immediate aftermath or time when a crime was actually

7

8

Which direction is he running?

the emergency nature of the -- of the call.

He's jumping on me.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

Very little of what
He's beating

What's his name?

I

It doesn't matter.

That's not related to

It is, Mr. Chief Justice, in

11

the sense that it's information that's needed to

12

respond to and resolve the imminent threat to this

13

woman's safety, which would certainly occur if the

14

individual decided to come back and finish what he'd

15

started.

16

911 calls so as not to gather adequate information and

17

this individual had come back and actually beaten or

18

killed the victim, it would certainly be regarded as an

19

inadequate response to the emergency situation of an

20

ongoing violent attack.

21

rule that we're describing here for the Court would

22

deal with not only the present emergency but also its

23

imminent, threatened recurrence.

24
25

And if a law enforcement authority set up its

And so for that reason, the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, rather than build that

into the law, it might be wiser to deal with Justice

Washington, DC 20005

1

Kennedy's case, in whatever system we come up with,

2

explaining it.

diamond necklace?

4

So what is your full explanation of the

MR. DREEBEN:

My -- my view on that is that

5

the kinds of statements that are made in the immediate

6

report of a crime are really in the form of excited

7

utterances that are much different from the kind of

8

dispassionate testimony that occurs after the fact that

9

prompted the confrontation right.

10

Now, the Court could accept that line and say

11

that jewelry thief reports are not testimony within the

12

meaning of the Confrontation Clause, or it could

13

disagree and say that no, when there's not the

14

immediate threatened, imminent potential for a

15

recurrence of the violence, then we're going to treat

16

that as closer to simply a report of a crime and treat

17

it as testimonial. Court could go either way on

18

that without touching the core of what's at issue

19

today, which is namely emergency situations that pose a

20

threat to the safety of the person who's making the

21

call or who's encountered by a law enforcement officer

22

on the scene in the immediate aftermath of an attack.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you wouldn't say that

24

every question asked in that context.

25

do it question by question?

Don't we have to

I mean, what if one of the

How

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that --- as an excited utterance?

-- the more that the -- the

7

questioning begins to delve into a past narrative of

8

past criminal activity, the more there is a reason to

9

think that it serves, in addition to its protection

10

purpose, an evidentiary purpose.

11

I'd hasten to add, Justice Scalia, that that

12

kind of information is very important for the officers

13

to know to gauge the seriousness of the threat, to get

14

the kind of idea of who they are dealing with, and to

15

respond effectively.

16

those kinds of questions and that information to be

17

elicited.

So it is reasonably necessary for

But I also agree with Your Honor's suggestion

19

that not everything that occurs in a 911 call should be

20

regarded as per se non-testimonial.

that happens at the scene of a crime should be regarded

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. FISHER:

12

Let me say a word about the record and then

Thank you.

13

two things about the emergency exception that we've

14

been talking about.

15

First, in the record it's always been

16

accepted in this case that Mr. Davis had left the house

17

when the 911 call started.

18

117, that's what the Washington Supreme Court said, and

19

at page 30 of the evidentiary hearing in the trial

20

court, the prosecutor submitted the case that way as

21

well.

22

In the joint appendix, page

Now let me address the history here because

23

it's important.

24

There's not a single case historically where a

25

aware of one.

JUSTICE BREYER:

We're not

That may be hearsay.

That

may all be hearsay.

MR. FISHER:

It -- it is what it is, Justice

Breyer.

on the other side is White v. Illinois in 1992.

statutes.

treatise.

17

the hue and cry and then the reason we have the Marian

statutes.

courts were not prepared to simply go on the initial

reports.

23

the person pending trial.

24

101 says the problem with the fresh reports the hue

And I'm -- and I want to refer the Court

He talks about the -- both the problem with

The reason we have the Marian statutes was

They don't -- they don't even answer all the questions

2

that we would want answered.

3

So what the United States is asking you to

4

accept is that the kind of evidence that the Framers

5

would not have even been prepared to allow at a

6

pretrial bail hearing -- rather, they wanted to have

7

something more formal -- they would now accept to be

8

used in the trial itself.

9

this turns everything on its head.

And what we think is that
The reason the

10

Marian statutes were abused is because, of course, in

11

continental Europe that was an accepted form of

12

evidence, and so there was some reason to believe these

13

formal statements could be used.

14

the hue and cry could be used.

15

No one ever suggested

operators, it frees the police officers to do what

3

they're supposed to do, which is immediately start

evidence from the moment that a crime is reported.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How do you think Professor Wigmore would have decided

MR. FISHER:

Well, this Court noticed that

Professor Wigmore had the view that the Confrontation

Clause applied only to witnesses that actually took the

stand.

acknowledged to you -- and this is interesting from his
