ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. KLINE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court has never held that a specific

11

structure for weighing aggravating and mitigating

12

factors is required by the eighth amendment.

13

Court has consistently held that all that is required

14

by the eighth amendment is for States to afford an

15

opportunity to jurors to consider all mitigating

16

evidence relevant to determination of a sentence other

17

than death.

18

Yet, this

The Kansas statute, it is undisputed in this

19

case, allowed the respondent to introduce all such

20

evidence and that the jurors, under Kansas law, are

21

specifically instructed to consider all such mitigating

22

evidence on an individualized basis.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

General, may -- may I -- I'd

24

like to pose a question which at least gets to the nub

25

of the issue, as I see it, and -- and get your response

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to it.

2

The premise of my question is this.

We -- we

3

generally regard mitigation evidence as favoring life,

4

aggravation evidence as favoring death.

5

case in which the -- the assumption is that they are

6

evenly balanced.

7

exactly even on that.

8

jury shall return the verdict of death.

9

We've got a

The -- the pans of the scale are
Kansas says in that case the

If we are going to demand, as we have said

10

that we're going to demand, that the determination --

11

that the death penalty determination be one of

12

what we have called reasoned moral judgment, then what

13

has to be supplied in order to make the Kansas

14

provision consistent with reasoned moral justice, it

15

seems to me, is a presumption in favor of death.

16

things being equal, there is a presumption in favor of

17

death.

Other

18

And my question is, am I correct in saying

19

that in order to hold your way, we have to hold that

20

the eighth amendment -- is consistent with the

21

eighth amendment to presume the appropriateness of

22

death, other things being equal?

23
24
25

MR. KLINE:

As the Court -- yes.

As the

Court has done in Walton, the standard in the -JUSTICE SOUTER:

You -- you agree that's --

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that's a proper way to look at the issue then.

2

MR. KLINE:

Well, to take the issue in its

3

total context and refer to the instructions and the

4

totality of what the jury is instructed, I would

5

disagree that there is a presumption of death --

6
7
8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then how do you get off the

dime?
MR. KLINE:

The jury is given in the

instruction, instruction number 4 and instruction

10

number 5, a direction as to the effect of their

11

reasoned moral judgment.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but the -- the

13

direction, as I understand it, is that if mitigation

14

and aggravation are even, then the only way to come to

15

a conclusion is to say, as the statute does, because

16

the mitigation does not outweigh the aggravation, you

17

should return a verdict of death.

18

another way of saying there is a presumption that if

19

aggravation and mitigation are equal, that the penalty

20

should be death.

21

MR. KLINE:

And that seems to me

Instruction number 5 does

22

instruct the juror, Justice Souter, that if the State

23

meets the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt

24

that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the

25

aggravating factors, then the jury shall sentence the

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

defendant to death.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The State has made a

3

judgment that this particular offense -- what's it

4

called?

Aggravated murder, you know, whatever --

5
6

MR. KLINE:

First, they have to be convicted,

Justice Scalia, of capital murder.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Capital murder, as its name

8

implies, warrants a judgment of death unless there are

9

mitigating factors that -- which indicate that that is

10

not proper.

11

MR. KLINE:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

That is correct, Justice Scalia.
That's a moral judgment,

isn't it?

14

MR. KLINE:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That certainly is, and -And even if the State had

16

said the opposite, it -- it is a -- still a State-

17

prescribed moral judgment.

18

capital murder warrants a judgment of death only if the

19

mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors,

20

that's still a State-prescribed moral judgment, isn't

21

it?

22

MR. KLINE:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

If the State had said

That is correct.
And can -- can you go back

24

to Justice Souter's question for a minute?

25

way I'm thinking about this, I'm making two assumptions

Because the

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that I'd like you to make:

2

such a case, which I very much doubt, but -- but this

3

is a lawyer's hypothetical, this whole thing, in a

4

sense.

5

such a case.

6

leaves this open, a matter that can be argued.

7

first, that there could be

But I'll make the assumption there could be
Second, I will assume that our case law

But suppose that we do make that assumption

8

for the moment.

9

made-up case is the case of the following.

Then what I'm thinking of is this
We have

10

aggravating factors and break them down into molecules

11

on a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here,

12

there is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the

13

juror who is very conscientious ends up with the same

14

number of molecules of equal weight on this scale.

15

in our made-up instance, Kansas says, if that's the

16

situation, you must say death.

17

And

Now, if that's the case, how would you

18

reconcile that with a view of the eighth amendment that

19

says if you're going to sentence someone to death,

20

there has to be something special about his case that

21

means it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case

22

because, after all, for every molecule of specialness

23

that warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation

24

that doesn't?

25

So that's where I am, trying to get the cases

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

out of it and trying to take very seriously the

2

hypothetical that is before us.

3

MR. KLINE:

There -- thank you, Justice

4

Breyer.

5

that must be approached and proven by the State before

6

we get to that actual equation.

7

There are several considerations and steps

First of all, the State follows the guided

8

discretion standard of this Court, as laid out in

9

Furman and its progeny, to a very narrow definition of

10

what capital murder is.

11

penalty statute is one of the most narrow in the

12

Nation.

13

In fact, the Kansas death

And then past that point to the sentencing

14

jury, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at

15

least one of eight specific aggravating factors exist

16

with jury unanimity.

17

And then past that point, Kansas has complied

18

with this Court's requirement under the eighth

19

amendment for a juror to consider and give effect to

20

all mitigating evidence relevant to a sentence other

21

than death and that instruction is specifically pointed

22

out in your appendix, pages 23 through 28.

23

Furthermore, the jurors are --

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

The Furman -- the --

it's hard to tell where the voice is coming from, I

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

know.

We ought to get that fixed.

2

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Furman narrowing is

4

produced by the very first part of subsection (e).

5

by a unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable

6

doubt that one or more of the aggravating circumstances

7

enumerated in -- in section 24-4625 and amendments

8

thereto exist -- that's the Furman.

9

MR. KLINE:

10

If,

That is correct, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And then beyond that you say

11

if that is found, then the jury has to find that the

12

existence of such aggravating does not outweigh.

13

MR. KLINE:

That is correct.

And that --

14

that is how it complies with your hypothetical, Justice

15

Breyer.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you see, my

17

hypothetical is designed to cut free of the language of

18

the cases.

19

language and show that.

20

the very point of those cases is you do not send

21

someone to death unless the jury decides that the

22

circumstances here make him somewhat worse, at least

23

one molecule worth of worse, than the typical person.

24

And given the evenness of the balance, I don't see how

25

we can say that, though I grant you, when you go back

I have no doubt you can go through the
And it's designed to say, but

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to those words in the cases, you're right.

2

MR. KLINE:

Well, the guided discretion of

3

this Court has indicated that the State must be able to

4

-- and a juror -- differentiate between a defendant who

5

is convicted of the same crime as to the -- and

6

sentenced to life as the defendant who is sentenced to

7

the same crime and sentenced to death.

8

laid out, as Justice Scalia pointed out, in the

9

definition of capital murder and the requirement of

10

And that is

aggravated factors.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, the -- the

12

instructions don't tell the jury to weigh the

13

molecules.

14

prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating

15

molecules do not outweigh the aggravating molecules.

They tell the jury that the State has to

16

MR. KLINE:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That is correct.
And how likely is it,

18

if you have a jury who thinks the -- a juror, who

19

thinks the molecules are precisely balanced, is going

20

to conclude that the State has carried its burden of

21

proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the 50 here

22

don't outweigh the 50 here?

23

MR. KLINE:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Mr. Chief Justice -It's a theoretical

proposition --

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KLINE:

Mr. Chief Justice, we are dealing

2

with a hypothetical that we believe does not exist in

3

jury deliberations.

4

whether they can live with the decision that is before

5

them and then decides whether the death penalty is

6

warranted.

7

A juror steps back and decides

And in fact, Kansas law leads them to that

8

reasoned moral decision.

9

number 4, which again is laid out in your appendix,

In Kansas law, in instruction

10

instructs the juror that mercy, in and of itself, is

11

sufficient to determine a sentence other than death.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let me ask -- ask you

13

this.

14

this case as a matter of shifting burdens of proof?

15

-- I take it the Constitution does not require the

16

State to introduce mitigating evidence.

17

that's the responsibility of the accused.

As a -- rather than presumptions, can we look at

18

MR. KLINE:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I

That's --

That is correct.
And so what we're saying

20

here is that when a State shows that the mitigators do

21

not outweigh the aggravators, then it's the

22

defendant's/accused's burden to go forward and show

23

that they do.

24
25

MR. KLINE:

Except -- you're correct, Justice

Kennedy, except that the burden on the State is beyond

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a reasonable doubt to demonstrate that, the highest

2

burden allowed by law.

3

in the Arizona statute, which was functionally

4

identical to the Kansas law, that was presented in this

5

-- to this Court in Walton v. Arizona, and this Court

6

rejected that very argument in that case.

7

recall, the Arizona law was that there was a

8

responsibility for the defendant to demonstrate that

9

mitigating factors were sufficiently substantial to

And beyond that burden that was

As you may

10

call for leniency.

11

decided that that meant that the mitigating factors

12

must outweigh the aggravating factors.

13

The Arizona Supreme Court had

And this Court accepted that case because of

14

a conflict between the ninth circuit which held, as the

15

Kansas Supreme Court did, in Adamson v. Ricketts, that

16

that was an unconstitutional violation of the eighth

17

amendment.

18

This Court resolved that conflict, and in

19

fact, States relied on that resolution, as did the

20

Kansas legislature, in articulating the very standard

21

except Kansas goes further and keeps the burden on the

22

State.

23

25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes.

burden was placed on the defendant, was it not -MR. KLINE:

20

relevancy, and Kansas has met the -- the requirements

21

of this Court, as it relates to the specific sentencing

22

or individualized sentencing structure, by allowing the

23

jury to consider all evidence relevant to the

24

determination of a sentence other than death.

25

The standard, though, in introduction is

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, that means they

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

comply with Lockett.

2

I want to ask you one question that goes back

3

to your colloquy with Justice Souter and Justice

4

Scalia.

5

made a moral judgment on a certain state of facts, the

6

death penalty shall be imposed and which you agreed

7

with.

based on the moral judgment of the State in certain

Justice Scalia pointed out that the State has

And that was true in the cases back in 1975 and

There were some State statutes that mandated death

10

circumstances.

11

statute.

I think one was a North Carolina

12

Do you ask us to reexamine those cases?

13

MR. KLINE:

No, Justice Stevens.

Actually

14

the State's position is consistent with the previous

15

decisions of this Court in this fashion.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It -- it does not rely on

17

the proposition that there's a situation in which

18

there's a mandated death penalty which is perfectly

19

okay.

20

MR. KLINE:

No, because there is a

21

requirement upon the State in the sentencing phase to

22

prove factors in aggravation with jury unanimity beyond

23

a reasonable doubt that set aside this particular act

24

in a different framework than those who commit capital

25

murder and are convicted of capital murder.

If the

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

State does not meet that burden --

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but of course, the

3

aggravators -- it would be permissible for a State to

4

include the aggravators necessary to narrow the category

5

in the definition of the crime itself.

6

MR. KLINE:

This Court has held that it does.

7

And Kansas has a very narrow death penalty in the

8

definition of capital murder and also the specified

9

aggravators that the State must prove.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But you would say that if

11

the State met that burden and there was no mitigating

12

or no substantial mitigating evidence, it would be

13

permissible to -- for the State to mandate the death

14

penalty.

15
16

MR. KLINE:

Just as it is in Walton v.

Arizona.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The answer is yes.

18

MR. KLINE:

Yes.

The answer is yes, Justice

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And you think that's fully

19
20
21
22

Stevens.

consistent with the North Carolina case.
MR. KLINE:

It is not fully consistent, I

23

don't believe.

24

in that this Court said a mandatory death penalty is

25

not unconstitutional, as long as the State

It is consistent with the Walton case

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

differentiates between those convicted of the same

2

crime and who are sentenced to life and those who are

3

convicted of the same crime and sentenced to death.

4

Kansas clearly does that in the requirement that the

5

State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one of at

6

least eight specific statutory aggravating factors

7

exist in the case.

8
9

But Kansas goes further.

Unlike in Walton v.

Arizona, the burden remains on the State to also prove

10

that the mitigating evidence proffered by the defendant

11

who has the lowest threshold allowed by law, and all

12

that is required by this Court -- that is relevancy --

13

that all of that evidence does not outweigh --

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, it -- that's the way

15

Justice Blackmun interpreted the majority, but the

16

majority didn't quite say that because it said the

17

burden on the defendant was to prove sufficient

18

mitigation to justify something other than the death

19

penalty.

20

burden with substantial mitigating evidence that came

21

out even.

And conceivably one could have met that

22

MR. KLINE:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, the -Under the majority's

24

opinion -- now, you're dead right about what Justice

25

Blackmun said, but --

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KLINE:

Justice Stevens, you are correct.

2

The majority didn't specifically address that, but

3

they also analyzed the case, much as Justice Kennedy

4

just did, in saying that really what we're talking

5

about is whether the State eventually at some point,

6

once it has met the requirement of the individualized

7

sentencing requirements of this Court, can say that

8

death is appropriate.

9

jurisprudence has been clearly yes once we are able to

And the answer in this Court's

10

set aside this defendant from other defendants

11

convicted of the same crime.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But you would agree that it

13

would be consistent with the -- the text of the

14

majority opinion to say it really meant they have to

15

prove enough mitigating evidence to make death the

16

inappropriate sentence, which could be less than --

17

even a 50/50 balance?

18

MR. KLINE:

Arguably, yes, Justice Stevens.

19

And that is the language of the Arizona statute, but it

20

would fly in the face of the interpretation of the

21

Arizona Supreme Court, as well as the Ninth Circuit

22

Court of Appeals in Adamson v. Ricketts which,

23

subsequent to the Walton decision, held that Walton

24

controlled and allowed the potentiality of equipoise to

25

be constitutional.

1

Now, one thing I would like to --

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Are you going to address

3

the other questions?

4

about whether the Kansas Supreme Court's judgment was

5

adequately supported by an independent State ground.

6

And I'm not sure that this has been adequately

7

addressed.

8
9

I think we added a question

Do we have jurisdiction here?

The -- the

Kansas Supreme Court vacated the capital murder

10

judgment and remanded it and said it would have done it

11

anyway because of the State law evidentiary error

12

concerning admission of third party guilt evidence.

13

does that independent ground mean we don't have

14

jurisdiction here on this thing?

15

MR. KLINE:

So

No, Justice O'Connor, there is

16

not an independent and adequate State ground for this

17

decision.

18

Court relies on this Court's interpretation of the

19

eighth amendment for the interpretation of the cruel or

20

unusual punishment clause of the Kansas constitution.

21
22
23

It is undisputed that the Kansas Supreme

Yes, but it is not adequate and

independent.

arguments are independent and adequate, and by their

2

very nature, they are dependent rather than

3

independent.

4

The Kansas Supreme Court engaged in a -- and

5

I quote from the decision -- a full reexamination of

6

the eighth amendment jurisprudence in coming to the

7

conclusion in paragraph 25 of the syllabus, which is

8

the law of the case in Kansas under Kansas law, that

9

the Kansas death penalty statute is unconstitutional on

10

its face.

11

jurisprudence history finding that determination.

12

That was the first such holding in Kansas

Previously, 3 years earlier, the court had

13

found the death penalty statute constitutional as

14

construed, and as this Court knows, you will not accept

15

jurisdiction of a State court's interpretation or

16

construction of a State law.

17

the first opportunity that the State has had and I

18

would say the last.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So, therefore, this is

this case remanded for a new trial?

21

MR. KLINE:

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It is, Your Honor.
And presumably, if there

23

is a conviction and a sentence, you could come back

24

here again by way of a cross appeal.

25

MR. KLINE:

That would be incorrect, Justice

Kansas is prohibited.

The prosecutors are

And -- and this Court had a similar case in

5

Neville v. South Dakota in which you construed South

6

Dakota law as it relates to limiting the prosecution's

7

ability to appeal and, through that construction,

8

identified in an interlocutory basis, when the lower

9

court passes on a constitutional measure that has

10

import for this Court, that the inability of the State

11

to be able to pursue that case renders jurisdiction

12

under 28, section 1257.

13

So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If I -- if I understand

14

what the situation is, there is no death penalty in

15

Kansas as a result of this decision.

16

MR. KLINE:

That is correct, Justice

17

Ginsburg.

18

court of our State has spoken and stricken it down as

19

unconstitutional on its face.

20

There is no death penalty.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The highest

Has there been any

21

movement in the legislature to change the law so you

22

won't be in this situation where there is no death

23

penalty?

24
25

MR. KLINE:

Justice Ginsburg, there's

significant discussion in the legislature, but that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

discussion is somewhat mixed, as you might imagine, and

2

some were concerned that action might moot this case.

3

Right now there are 12 pending capital murder cases in

4

Kansas which, if this Court does not reverse the Kansas

5

Supreme Court, the State will not be able to seek

6

capital murder charges and the death sentence in those

7

cases.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, that wouldn't be true

if you amended the statute though, would it?

If you -- if

10

they amended the statute to take the 50/50 problem out

11

of it, which wouldn't seem to me all that difficult,

12

you could still impose the death penalty on these other

13

12 people who haven't been tried.

14

MR. KLINE:

It is our position, Justice

15

Stevens, since their crimes were committed prior to any

16

act of the legislature, we would be prohibited from

17

seeking the death penalty.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

20
21
22
23

Because of an ameliorating

position.

That is -- that is our -- our

It would have to take an entire -JUSTICE STEVENS:

I doubt if you'd take that

position if they did it.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. KLINE:

Well, Justice Stevens, if you put

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

me in that position, I will be an advocate for the

2

State.

3

However, it is our position, as Justice

4

Ginsburg alluded to, that the State has no death

5

penalty and it would take a complete reenactment of the

6

death penalty for the State to have one.

7

And that is borne out in case law.

There is

8

no uncertainty as it relates to the ability of the

9

State to seek appeal in charging death once there is no

10

death statute that is available.

11

Kansas law to KSA section 22-3602(b) are a very settled

12

area of the law.

13

(1) of that statute would allow us an opportunity to

14

preserve this issue below.

15

to the State being able to appeal charging documents,

16

and the definitions of those documents are very

17

specific in Kansas law.

18

The references in

The respondent argues that subsection

However, that only relates

Furthermore, subsection (3) states that a

19

prosecutor can reserve an issue, but case law is very

20

clear, and that is only if the Kansas Supreme Court

21

sees that issue as important for the administration of

justice, the uniform administration of justice, in the

23

statutes as Kansas.

It will effectively strike down the laws of

And furthermore, it would effectively call

10

into question the laws of five other States that do not

11

even require any weighing mechanism whatsoever.

12

Court has never gone further and required a specific

13

mechanism of weighing aggravating and mitigating

14

circumstances and has relegated that duty, as it

15

should, to the States as long as the juror has the

16

opportunity to make the reasoned moral decision based

17

on the consideration of all mitigating evidence

18

relevant to a decision other than death that relates to

19

the character, the background of the defendant, or the

circumstances of the offense.

And if you would look in your joint appendix

on pages 25 and 26, you will see the instructions that

bear a greater burden in its consideration -- for the

on paragraph 2 of instruction 4 that mercy in and of

12

itself is sufficient -- is sufficient -- to outweigh

of life.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA E. WOODMAN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13
14

MS. WOODMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to devote the bulk of my time to

15

answering the State's arguments on the merits because

16

the constitutional issue presented by the Kansas

17

capital sentencing statute is actually quite different

18

than the State and its amici would have it appear.

19

Their arguments rest on an erroneous assumption about

20

the way the statute operates and the real issues that

21

its operation raises.

22

Under the Kansas formula, prosecutors can and

23

do urge jurors not to persevere in their decision-

24

making if they are undecided regarding the balance of

25

aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

In other

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

words, if the decision is too hard to make, the

2

sentence must be death.

3

The formula --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But is it reasonable

4

to suppose that one of those cases where it's too hard

5

to decide is when there are 50 molecules on one side

6

and 50 on the other?

7

me that that's an easy case to say that the State has

8

not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt

9

that the mitigating factors don't outweigh the

10

In other words, it would seem to

aggravating ones when the evidence is evenly balanced.

11

MS. WOODMAN:

No, Your Honor.

I think that

12

it's not right to think of this in terms of

13

mathematical formulas, molecules on one side or the

14

other.

15

that the jury makes, and whatever capital sentencing

16

statute a State chooses, States are free to choose

17

whatever structure they see fit to determine whether

18

death is an appropriate sentence.

19

not free to enact a statute that doesn't ensure a

20

reliable determination that death is an appropriate

21

sentence, and that's what we're dealing with here.

22

It's a qualitative judgment and one can imagine, very

23

easily I think, a scenario where jurors are

24

deliberating.

25

they cannot make a determination whether aggravators

This is a subjective, qualitative determination

However, States are

They take their jobs very seriously and

2

outweigh mitigators, or vice versa.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's because the

3

defendant hasn't introduced enough evidence of

4

mitigation and that's the duty of the defendant to come

5

forward with it.

6

MS. WOODMAN:

Well, in -- in a situation of

7

equipoise, by which I mean a state of indecision on

8

whether the relative balance between aggravating and

9

mitigating circumstances, burden of proof is not the

10
11

sticking point there.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you say it's a state

12

of indecision.

13

factors have been established.

14

The jury has decided that aggravating

MS. WOODMAN:

But that -- that's -- that's

15

the problem because that's not a reliable

16

determination.

17

the individual --

18

It's no determination that based upon

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why isn't it a reliable

19

determination that, number one, it's a death-qualified

20

accused in -- in any event, and there have been

21

specific aggravators proved?

22

That has been determined.

It's now for the defendant, in effect, to show that

23

the mitigating circumstances outweigh this.

24

you have the bonus that the State has to prove beyond a

25

reasonable doubt that the mitigators have not

The -- and

27
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

outweighed the aggravators.

2

MS. WOODMAN:

But the jury is specifically

3

instructed under this formula that they have a third

4

option, and that is where they can't make a decision,

5

whether aggravators outweigh mitigators, or vice versa

6

--

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They have made the

8

decision.

9

aggravators are there and have not been outweighed.

10
11

They have made the decision that the

They have made that decision.
MS. WOODMAN:

But the jury is required to

12

impose death at that point, and it is a decision that

13

aggravators are not outweighed by mitigators.

14

Court's eighth amendment jurisprudence requires --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But this

That's because the

16

mitigation case hasn't been made.

17

MS. WOODMAN:

The eighth amendment requires

18

jurors to make a determination, based upon individual

19

characteristics, whether death is an appropriate

20

sentence, whether the defendant deserves death.

21

when the jury is in a situation of equipoise and is

22

required to impose death, they're imposing death

23

without having made that determination that death is an

24

appropriate --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

10

that makes them morally one way, there's a factor that

makes them morally the other way.

13

So they're

Now, that's -- that's what I think this case

14

presents.

15

thinking just what I said.

16

was such a juror, but if there was such a juror, the

17

statute in this instant tells him what to do.

18
19

And I -- I mean, I imagine a juror who's

MS. WOODMAN:
to do.

20

I don't know if there ever

The statute does tell them what

It tells -JUSTICE BREYER:

It says where you think

21

there is an equivalent, but not a moral difference,

22

death.

23

MS. WOODMAN:

Well, but if -- if you think --

24

if you look at the prosecutorial arguments, for

25

example, that have been made in both the Kleypas and

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Marsh cases, those prosecutorial arguments have urged

2

the jurors to do exactly what I described, and that is

3

to abdicate their decision to make a -- a determination

4

based on the -- on individual characteristics on

5

the question of whether death is an appropriate

6

punishment for this individual offender based on the

7

specific circumstances of this crime, and that if

8

they're in equipoise, they have to impose a death

9

sentence.

That is encouraging the jurors to abdicate

10

their decision to determine whether death is an

11

appropriate sentence or not.

12

Then --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. -- Ms. Woodman, you

14

know, I -- I have not, you know, gone along with --

15

with most of our Walton jurisprudence anyway, but --

16

but what I have really always thought it demanded was

17

really nothing more precise than that a jury has to be

18

given the opportunity to grant mercy.

19

sure I would describe any of it as any more precise

20

than that.

21

MS. WOODMAN:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I'm not

Well -The jury has to be given the

23

Well --- and clearly exists

7

that really thinks this person should not go to death

can -- can do it.

9

Any jury that --

In fact, you know, I guess the

10

instruction that says -- what is it?

11

appropriateness of the exercise of mercy can itself be

12

a mitigating factor.

13

what else do you have to do?

14

The

I mean, gee, what -- what else --

MS. WOODMAN:

But that's one factor among

15

many that the jury has to consider.

16

here is that the jury could have all of the information

17

that a defendant has proffered as a basis for a

18

sentence less than death, and a jury could still be

19

unable to decide whether aggravation or mitigation is

20

the weightier in a closely balanced case.

21

the problem here.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the problem

And that is

Any jury that thought this

-- this person did not deserve death would have ample

opportunity to give expression to that determination

And in that case, the prosecutorial

mitigating evidence unless they find that mitigating

State's burden of proof, which is beyond a reasonable

reasonable doubt that the aggravators are not

outweighed by the mitigators.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right.

Okay.

And --

10

and if the jury cannot decide whether the aggravators

11

are outweighed by the mitigators, if they're in perfect

equipoise, who loses?

This is about terminating

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's true I -- I think,

And then the question is, does a State have a

anything else, but to have perhaps the artificial

Put it all

I find it is in equipoise.

22

Next question:

MS. WOODMAN:

what happens?

Well, the statute hasn't

24

assigned a burden of proof, but still that's not the

25

problem here.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, I agree with you.

That's not the problem.
MS. WOODMAN:

Because what the

4

individualization requirement means, in this Court's

5

own jurisprudence, is that mere consideration of

6

mitigating circumstances is not enough.

7

so in Tennard and in many other cases, Penry v.

8

Johnson, that it's not enough that the sentencer be

9

allowed to consider mitigating circumstances.

The Court said

It must

10

be allowed to consider and give effect to those

11

mitigating circumstances.

12

And when a jury cannot decide between

13

aggravating and mitigating circumstances, when that

14

jury is, nevertheless, required under this -- that

15

situation to impose a sentence of death, the sentence

16

of death has been imposed without the jury having made

17

the requisite individualized sentencing decision under

18

the eighth amendment at the selection stage.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I might point out -- I just

20

looked at the question presented.

21

and I guess is drafted by the Kansas Attorney General.

22

It does assume --

The question is what happens when mitigating and

23

aggravating evidence is in equipoise.

24

assumption on which we took the case is that there will

25

be cases in which there's equipoise.

So the

MS. WOODMAN:

That's right.

And the Kansas

2

Supreme Court found that that was a real possibility.

3

And the Kansas Supreme Court found this statute

4

unconstitutional in Kleypas because it violates the

5

individualized sentencing requirement, and the court

6

specifically found that it requires death when jurors

7

are unable to decide the balance between aggravating

8

and mitigating circumstances.

9

was construed in Kleypas.

10

That's how the statute

I would like to address the jurisdictional

11

issue for a few moments, unless there are any further

12

questions from the Court on the equipoise issue, which

13

I'd be happy to answer.

14

to discuss today is the jurisdictional issue on the

15

adequate and independent State law ground, which this

16

Court asked the parties to brief.

17

But one of the things I want

I feel that the State misstates the issue

18

there as well because in the Kansas Supreme Court, the

19

State conceded the Federal unconstitutionality of the

20

Kansas equipoise formula, as decided by the court in

21

the Kleypas case 4 years ago, and defended in this case

22

only on the contested State law ground of severability

23

and bypassed raising a Federal question in a motion for

24

a rehearing, which again relied solely on State law

25

severability grounds.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but the -- the Attorney

2

General said that the -- the fact that in this

3

particular case the issue was focused on, in effect,

4

sort of remedy, severance, and so on, was dependent

5

upon the assumption about what Federal law required.

6

It was dependent upon the earlier case which so held.

7

So I don't -- and -- and what he seem -- says seems

8

plausible to me.

9

the judgment here with the earlier judgment, which

I -- I don't see how we can divorce

10

Kansas -- which the Kansas Supreme Court relied upon

11

here, which was a Federal ground.

12

MS. WOODMAN:

Well, it's clear that the

13

Kansas Supreme Court's decision relies on severability

14

as a basis for its decision, and it's true that the

15

Kansas Supreme Court, in doing so, reiterated the

16

Kleypas holding.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It wouldn't have even raised

18

the issue had it not been for the earlier Federal

19

holding.

20

Isn't that correct?
MS. WOODMAN:

That's right, but Mr. Marsh

21

raised the issue on State law severability grounds.

22

The State conceded that Mr. Marsh was entitled to have

23

his death sentence vacated because of the

24

unconstitutional equipoise provision.

15

But that didn't happen here.

What happened

16

here was that the court merely reiterated a holding

from 4 years ago, and the State law severability

decision, which was the issue in contest in this case

19

and the issue that was decided in this case, the

20

matter of State law, and it was sufficient to support

the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court.

22

And really, what -- what the State is trying

to do here is to -- I mean, these issues were decided

14

they were saying was that the appropriate remedy in

Kleypas was to return the subject to the legislature

16

because the statute was ambiguous and the court had no

authority, under separation of powers grounds and under

18

State law statutory interpretation grounds, to construe

this statute to mean the opposite of what it said.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Wouldn't they have come out

the same way if they never mentioned the Federal issue?

13

MR. KLINE:

This case come out -- no, it

14

would not because the Kleypas court found that the

15

Kansas -- or the Kansas death penalty was

16

constitutional as construed.

17

this case found it unconstitutional on its face.

18

there is a significant difference, and the court raised

19

the issue again.

20

And the Kansas court in
And

I would like to point out to the Court that

21

there are five ways that a juror can, after their

22

reasoned moral decision, give effect to the belief that

23

the mitigating evidence does not warrant the death

24

penalty.

25

The juror can state that they have a

51
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reasonable doubt as to whether the State has met its

2

burden of proving that the mitigating factors do not

3

outweigh the aggravating factors.

4

The juror can simply delay.

Kansas law has a

5

defect -- default for life in its sentence or in its

6

structure, and I would encourage you to read on page 28

7

of your appendix instruction number 12 in which the jury

8

is told that if, after a reasonable time, you are unable

9

to make a decision -- in other words, in a doubtful

10

case -- the judge is required by law to dismiss the

11

jury and sentence the defendant to life.

12

is a default for life, and that is another way that a

13

juror can give effect to their reasoned moral decision

14

that death is not appropriate.

And so there

The juror can give effect to their reasoned

16

moral decision that is not appropriate by determining

17

that the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating

factors.

And the juror under instruction number 5 -JUSTICE STEVENS:

determining that they're in equipoise.

But it cannot do that by

That is correct, Justice Stevens.
Which is the very issue

your -- your petition presents us with.
MR. KLINE:

It is, but the juror does know

what the effect of that decision is and, therefore, is

able to engage in a reasoned moral choice.

What truly happens -- and -- and Justice

3

Breyer alluded to it, I believe, as it relates to this

4

hypothetical about weighing molecules -- is that a

5

juror essentially steps back and decides what is the

6

appropriate sentence --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, do it.

Do it.

8

Make the reasoned moral choice.

9

we have, because of the balancing, molecules or not --

And the facts are that

10

we have by the balancing made a determination that

11

anything for the bad that distinguishes this person

12

from the ordinary is -- is equally balanced by the

13

good.

Now, make the moral choice.

MR. KLINE:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. KLINE:

I think the moral -What is the reason?

I think the moral decision,

17

Justice Breyer, is determined in all the variables of

18

the introduction of the evidence, and as this Court has

19

required under the eighth amendment, that it allow the

20

jury to consider and give effect to all mitigating

21

evidence relevant.

22

And that's in Kansas law.

I would state this in closing, and that is

23

that the Kansas legislature reenacted the death penalty

24

for the first time since this Court struck it down in

25

Furman in the spring of 1994.

And in doing so, it gave

of the meaning of the Constitution.

the instructions and the law that is provided to you in

this case, you will see this Court's words mirrored

back to you in the scheme of the Kansas law as it

relates to the death penalty.

Thank you.
