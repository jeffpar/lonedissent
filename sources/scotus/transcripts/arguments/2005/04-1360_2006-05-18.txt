ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. MORAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

For centuries the knock and announce rule has

11

been a core part of the right of the people to be

12

secure in their houses from unreasonable searches and

13

seizures.

14

government has the right to enter a house, whether to

15

perform an arrest, to search for evidence, or to seize

16

goods, that the people should have the right to answer

17

the door in a dignified manner, except in an emergency,

18

and to avoid the unnecessarily gratuitous embarrassment

19

and shock that often follows a precipitous police

20

entry.

21

It reflects the notion that when the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So wouldn't it be

22

more accurate to say that it's protected the right to

23

be free from unreasonable entry as opposed to

24

unreasonable search and seizure?

25

MR. MORAN:

Well, this Court has recognized

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in Wilson, consistent with the common law authorities,

2

Mr. Chief Justice, that they are connected, that the

3

entry directly affects the reasonableness of the search

4

and seizure that occurs within.

5

Court in Miller and in Sabbath suppressed the evidence

6

following knock and announce violations.

7

Wilson, this Court directly stated that the common law,

8

the Fourth Amendment, -- the common law that informs

9

the Fourth Amendment, directly demonstrates that the

And that's why this

But in

10

Framers thought that the method of entry directly

11

affects whether a search or seizure inside a home is

12

reasonable.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So -- so in your view,

14

there has to be a 4- to 6-hour search for complex

15

financial records, business documents.

16

warrant.

17

to knock.

They say, oh, you know, we are police

18

officers.

There's a discussion for a while.

19

anything seized after that is -- must be suppressed.

There's a

The search is otherwise proper.

20

MR. MORAN:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They forget

But --

If there is -It just seems to me in the

22

hypothetical I put -- and there's obviously a reason I

23

put it -- is there's just no causal link between the --

24

the suppression and -- and the failure to knock.

25

MR. MORAN:

Your Honor, the evidence inside

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- the evidence is seized inside.

2

evidence inside is directly related to the manner of

3

entry, just as there's a direct causal link between

4

when the officers come in without a warrant when they

5

should have gotten a warrant first.

6

was an exigent --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

related.

9

have in mind.

10

The seizure of the

They thought there

Well, but you say directly

That -- that assumes the very point that I
I don't know why it's directly related.

MR. MORAN:

Well, going back to Wilson, this

11

Court said in Wilson, if I might quote from Wilson,

12

that the -- the common law search and seizure leaves no

13

doubt that the reasonableness of a search of a dwelling

14

may depend in part on whether law enforcement officers

15

announce their presence and authority prior to

16

entering.

17
18
19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It depends -- it depends in

part.
MR. MORAN:

It depends in part, certainly.

20

There are other factors as well, but the reasonableness

21

of the search depends in part.

22

The issue --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, what -- what do you

24

do with our opinion in -- in 1986 in Segura v. United

25

States, which seems to me to contradict your assertion

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that you cannot separate, for purposes of the

2

exclusionary rule, the manner of entry from the search?

3

In that case, the -- the policemen entered without a

4
5

search warrant.

So the entry was clearly a violation.

They left two officers in the room and other officers

6

went back and got a search warrant.

7

with the search warrant, the two officers who were in

8

the room proceeded to do a search, and we admitted the

9

evidence.

When they returned

It seems to me that in that case, we -- we

10

did succeed in -- in separating the -- the entry from

11

the subsequent search, and I don't know why -- why we

12

can't do the same thing here.

13
14

MR. MORAN:

circumstances, Justice Scalia, in Segura.

15
16

Because there were exceptional

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what were the

exceptional circumstances?

17

MR. MORAN:

A 19-hour delay and a warrant

18

that was obtained that had nothing to do with the

19

initial entry.

20

initial entry.

21

That was in no way dependent on the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We're still, it would seem

22

to me -- I don't know -- the warrant wasn't dependent

23

on the initial entry?

24

entry wasn't the product of the -- of the later

25

warrant.

You could also say the initial

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MORAN:

The initial entry was not the

2

product of the later warrant, but once this Court ruled

3

--

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. MORAN:

6

entry wasn't lawful.

7
8

And therefore was unlawful.

That's right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The -- the initial

But we didn't hold -- but we

didn't hold that.

9

MR. MORAN:

Well, but this -- the Government

10

in Segura never contested the fact that the evidence

11

that was seen and seized during the initial entry

12

should be suppressed.

13

here.

14
15
16

And that's all we're asking for

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me?

No, I don't

understand that.
MR. MORAN:

When the officers went in

17

initially in Segura, some evidence was seen and seized

18

at that time, and the Government did not contest that

19

that evidence should not --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

I'm talking about only

21

the evidence that -- that was the product of the search

22

conducted after the warrant was delivered.

23

MR. MORAN:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

That's right.
And that evidence was

admitted in.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MORAN:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

Right, but the --

those officers was an unlawful entry.

4

MR. MORAN:

The entry -- the initial entry

5

was an unlawful entry.

6

warrant --

7

When they came back with the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

9

was unlawful.

10

Even though the entry of

Well, no, no.

The -- there

You said the initial entry

Those officers stayed there.

Their

presence there was the product of an unlawful entry.

11

MR. MORAN:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Their presence was, yes.
Their presence was the

13

product of an unlawful entry, and nonetheless, we

14

admitted in the -- the material that they obtained in

15

the search after a warrant had been obtained.

16

MR. MORAN:

I -- I read Segura as saying that

17

the presence -- the later presence of the warrant,

18

which was in no way tainted by the initial entry, made

19

the officers' presence in the home retroactively lawful

20

from that point.

21

which is why the Government did not contest the -- the

22

point that all the evidence that was seized during the

23

initial entry up to the point when the warrant was

24

issued had to be suppressed.

25

for here.

It was unlawful until that point,

That's all we're asking

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

I can imagine hypotheticals in which you have

2

a knock and announce violation and then something

3

happens like in Segura or like in Murray, where you

4

have later action that creates an independent source.

5

But in your typical --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the -- suppose the

7

officer -- excuse me, we forgot to knock, but we are

8

police officers.

9

proceed with a search.

10

We're going to

Please don't be alarmed.

We're

going to -- does that do it?

11
12

We do have a warrant.

MR. MORAN:

That might do it.

That would be

a different case than the case we have here --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but your -- your

14

point is -- is there -- is that they have to go out and

15

come back in again.

16

MR. MORAN:

You would have to create some

17

sort of analogy to Murray and Segura.

18

Segura are exceptional cases.

19

cases when the Government breaks in and then realizes

20

we shouldn't have done that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

forget what it is in torts.

24

supervening, independent cause or something like that.

25

MR. MORAN:

It's kind of a

Yes.

And -- and you can

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

have -- imagine such hypotheticals in the knock and

2

announce context.

3

Circuit, you have one where you have a knock and

4

announce violation committed in the outer door.

5

evidence is found in the outer door, but then the

6

officers properly knock and announce at the inner door,

7

and the Court in the Ninth Circuit held that that was

8

proper to seize that.

9

That -- that seems like a proper result because

And in the Moreno case in the Ninth

No

We have no problem with that.

10

ultimately the purposes of the knock and announce rule

11

were vindicated when the officers knocked and announced

12

at the inner door before -- before forcing entry.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Moran, how -- how

14

long do you think the officers had to wait before they

15

could have entered?

16

MR. MORAN:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

MR. MORAN:

19
20

15 seconds.

In this case?
Yes.

From Banks, somewhere closer to

15 to 20 seconds was considered --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What would -- if they

21

had done that, what would have been different from what

22

happened in this case?

23

MR. MORAN:

Mr. Hudson presumably would have

24

gotten up from his chair, would have come to the door,

25

would have admitted the officers, and then after --

Let's see what they want?

We presume that people act

lawfully in response to commands from the police.

7

do not presume that people will act unlawfully.

8

9

in fact, act unlawfully by trying to dispose the

If the

evidence or by --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't a good sign of

12

what might have happened what actually happened when

13

the police came in, which was there was an effort to

14

hide the evidence?

15

MR. MORAN:

The record does not disclose any

16

effort on Mr. Hudson's part to hide any evidence, Your

17

Honor.

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought -- where --

where were the drugs found?

20

MR. MORAN:

The rocks of crack cocaine, for

21

which he was convicted, were found in his left front

22

pants pocket.

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where was the gun

found?
MR. MORAN:

The gun was in the chair.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

MR. MORAN:

In the chair?

In the chair.

There was no

3

evidence that there was any secreting of evidence in

4

this case.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there any reason

6

to suppose that if the officers had waited 15 seconds

7

instead of the 3 to 4, that they wouldn't have found

8

the same evidence?

9

MR. MORAN:

It's always possible, Your Honor,

10

but we don't presume that.

11

Court said --

12

Just as in Segura, the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the only -- the

13

only reason they wouldn't have found the same evidence,

14

I take it, is if they -- if -- if the defendants had

15

had additional time to dispose of it.

16

MR. MORAN:

We don't contest that they would

17

have found the same evidence, no.

18

Mr. Hudson or any of the other people in the house

19

would have destroyed the evidence.

It's in -- in the chair.
I think it's pretty clear

you don't talk of something as being in the chair.

It's on the chair unless you stuff it in the chair.

11

assume he stuffed it behind a pillow or something.

12
13

MR. MORAN:

I

I'm not completely clear exactly

where in the chair it was.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

said it was in the chair.

49 of the 50 States currently

19

suppress evidence following knock and announce

20

violations, just as this Court did in -- in Miller and

21

Sabbath.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what do you think is

23

the standard for determining what sort of causal

24

connection there has to be in order to have suppression

25

here?

MR. MORAN:

test.

fruit of the violation?

4

clear, logical connection?

Is the evidence that was recovered the direct

5

In other words, is there a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, my opponent -What's the purpose of the

6

causal connection requirement?

7

having it?

8
9

MR. MORAN:

What's the reason for

Well, it's so -- it's so that

there is a -- an obvious connection.

Before the court

10

takes the step of -- of excluding evidence, there

11

should be some connection, some clear connection,

12

between the violation and the evidence recovered.

13

my --

14
15
16

JUSTICE ALITO:

But

And what's the reason for

requiring a clear connection?
MR. MORAN:

I suppose that it's simply the

17

matter of logic, that evidence that's completely

18

unrelated to a violation nobody would think should be

19

-- should be excluded.

But evidence --

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. MORAN:

But why?

Well, it's -- it's unrelated.

So

22

if, for example, the police break into my house and --

23

and find evidence -- find nothing in my house -- they

24

illegally break into my house, but then they -- they do

25

a proper warrant search of my office and find evidence,

Washington, DC 20005

1

I -- I don't -- I don't see any connection between the

2

illegal search of my house and the legal search of my

3

office, assuming that it was not the fruit of the

4

illegal search of my house.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

But why?

Isn't the reason

6

just a -- just a question of crafting an appropriate

7

remedy for -- an appropriate deterrence --

8

MR. MORAN:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

MR. MORAN:

Yes.
-- for violations?

Exactly.

It -- the whole point

11

is deterrence.

12

who illegally broke into my house by excluding the

13

evidence from my office if -- if -- it may even well be

14

different --

15
16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sure you would.

Sure you

would.

17
18

And so you wouldn't deter the officers

MR. MORAN:

Well, it may well even be a

different --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, you'd deterred him

20

more if you threw the whole case out, but we don't do

21

that.

22

MR. MORAN:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. MORAN:

No, we don't.

MR. MORAN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We do.
-- to the -- and -- and the

4

related usually means that the acquisition of the

evidence was the product of the violation.

6

caused by the violation.

7

we keep it out.

8
9

It was

And -- and for that reason,

And here, it's -- it's hard to say that this
was caused by the fact that they -- that they entered

10

in a few seconds too soon.

11

the door and they would have seen the stuff.

12

MR. MORAN:

So he would have answered

What the knock and announce

13

violation causes, Justice Scalia, is the officer to be

14

illegally in the home.

15

authorities, the courts have long recognized --

16

American courts have long recognized that an officer

17

who illegally enters a home, even with a valid writ or

18

a valid piece of paper allowing him to be in the home,

19

if the manner of entry is illegal, he is a trespasser.

20
21
22
23

Going back to the common law

His entry is -- is void ab initio.

And so in that

sense, the entry is the cause of the illegal -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Although you say it can be

retroactively validated.

24

MR. MORAN:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

After Segura -Yes, in Segura, you can

retroactively validate it by -- by getting a warrant

afterwards.

3

Could it be -- have been retroactively

4

validated by knocking and announcing afterwards?

5

-- I'm sorry we came in too soon, and they run back to

6

the door and they knock and announce and wait -- wait

MR. MORAN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. MORAN:

I'm

Again, I -Would that do the job?

I concede that it's possible that

11

you can come up with a Segura-type hypothetical.

12

think the easiest one is the Moreno case from the Ninth

13

Circuit.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

The hypothetical sounds

15

ridiculous only if one accepts your explanation of

Segura, that -- that it was somehow a retroactive

validation.

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Well -Sorry.

Can you hear me all right?

21

MR. MORAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, I can, Justice Breyer.
Why is it retroactive

cases are Silverthorne cases.

An independent chain of

events that almost certainly would have led to the

discovery of the evidence despite -- not without --

MR. MORAN:

And that's exactly right.

And --

13

and the situation we have in Michigan now is that

14

officers know to a certainty that if they violate the

15

knock and announce rule, nothing will happen.

16

that's why in all the other States --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so

That's not true.

18

There are cases where the violation of the knock and

19

announce rule gives rise to evidence that may be

20

admitted and that would presumably be excluded if you

21

can show that the seizure is related to the violation.

22

The problem here is that the evidence that is being

23

suppressed, as -- as you've suggested, that there's no

24

question that it would have been available if the

25

officers had waited 15 seconds as opposed to 4 seconds.

MR. MORAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, none of the

2

parties has been able to identify any cases in which

3

you can point to evidence and say this -- this evidence

4

was produced by the knock and announce violation and

5

nothing else in the house --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The Solicitor General

7

hypothesized one in the amicus briefs.

8

you know, they -- they burst in and someone screams,

9

you know, run away, it's the police, that excited

If somebody --

10

utterance caused by the absence of a knock and announce

11

would presumably be related to the violation and could

12

be suppressed.

13

drugs that are found in the room is in the same

14

category.

15

That doesn't mean that the gun and the

MR. MORAN:

If I may make two responses to

16

that.

17

case but has not identified a single case where that's

18

ever happened.

19

First, the Solicitor General hypothesized such a

It's purely hypothetical.

But the second point is that excluding that

20

evidence would have no deterrent effect whatsoever

21

because by -- by definition, that's evidence that the

22

police would only get by committing the knock and

23

announce violation.

24

risking the possibility that somebody will make an

25

excited utterance and then say, okay, we won't get to

So the police lose nothing by

gotten that excited utterance in the first place.

That's not deterrence, Mr. Chief Justice.

restitution.

5

from stealing something by being told that if I'm

6

caught, I'll have to give it back.

7

That's

That's like saying that I can be deterred

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What it is is

8

recognizing that if there is a fruit of the illegal

9

act, it is suppressed so that there is a cost to the

10

illegal act.

11

that happens after the illegal act is a fruit of the

12

illegal act.

13

What it's saying is that not everything

MR. MORAN:

I think your question, Mr. Chief

14

Justice, really goes to the worst position language in

15

Nix, and the point is, from our brief, is that this

16

Court has placed the prosecution in the worst position

17

than it would have been had the police acted lawfully

18

dozens, possibly scores, of time -- times.

19

All the cases in which the Court has noted

20

that the police easily could have obtained a warrant.

21

Most recently in Georgia v. Randolph, where this Court

22

noted that there were two lawful methods for the police

23

to get the cocaine -- the cocaine residue on the straw,

24

but still suppressed the evidence.

25

prosecution do get placed in a worse position, and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What --

Would it have been

possible for these police to get a no-knock warrant?

MR. MORAN:

It might well have been.

I was

5

asked this question last time, Justice Ginsburg, and

6

I'd like to modify my answer.

7

statute governing no-knock warrants, and there's --

8

there are also no court decisions governing no-knock

9

warrants.

10

In Michigan, there is no

And there never will be under the People v.

Stevens regime.

11

One of the nice things that's happened in --

12

in -- since Wilson v. Arkansas, in fact, before Wilson

13

v. Arkansas in many States, is courts have developed --

14

developed procedures for police officers to get no-

15

knock warrants, to go to the police and ask for a no-

16

knock warrant.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what about in this

18

case, which is Justice Ginsburg's question?

19

police said, we have reasonable grounds to -- to

20

believe that he has a weapon and we're also looking for

21

drugs that are easily disposable, would that be grounds

22

for knocking -- for not -- for dispensing with the

23

knock requirement?

24
25

MR. MORAN:

If the

Could the -- could a judge have

issued such a warrant in Michigan?

Is that your

1

question?

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

step.

4

--

Well, let's take it step by

Suppose the police articulate this at the outset

5

MR. MORAN:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It could well --- and under -- under State

7

procedures, they're allowed to make the on-the-spot

8

judgment.

9

allow them to enter without the knock?

10

Would that -- would those facts suffice to

MR. MORAN:

If they had specific information

11

along those lines, that -- that there was evidence

12

hidden in places or -- or stored in places where it

13

could easily be disposed --

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, is that correct?

I

15

thought in most States, there had to be a statute that

16

authorizes a non-knock warrant.

17

MR. MORAN:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In most States -And that most States do

19

have such statutes.

20

Michigan chooses to go on -- on a separate path.

21

And we had this case because

MR. MORAN:

Most States do have statutes, but

22

a few States by court decision have allowed for the

23

issuance of no-knock warrants.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

My point --

Even -- even if Michigan

doesn't, I mean, that has nothing -- as I understand

22
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it, that -- that doesn't affect the -- the answer to

2

the Federal question that we have because, as I

3

understand it, we -- we can -- we can take as good law

4

that even with a warrant that does not have a no-knock

5

authorization, if the police have a justification for

6

going in without knocking, so far as the Fourth

7

Amendment is concerned, the search is still good.

8

MR. MORAN:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's right.

10

MR. MORAN:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't that correct?

Absolutely.
So what we're really arguing

12

is what -- what is Michigan law on the subject, but the

13

-- the issue we've got is not Michigan law.

14

MR. MORAN:

That's right.

And this case

15

comes to us in the posture in which --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But this is a -- this is a

17

place -- a case in which the warrant was for drugs.

18

that not so?

19

MR. MORAN:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is

It was.
Well, so in -- in this

21

case, they could have entered in your view if they had

22

specific knowledge of the gun and disposable

23

contraband.

24
25

MR. MORAN:

Yes, after Banks and -- and

Richards, especially Richards, if the police had

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reasonable suspicion that you had contraband in a

2

position where it could be easily disposed and if they

3

had information about the weapons that could be used to

4

resist the police entry, then yes, there could have

5

been a -- a legal no-knock entry.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

without the latter?

8

be enough.

9
10
11

What about just the former

I thought the former alone would

MR. MORAN:

Either would be.

That's correct,

Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Going back to my question,

12

isn't it then a reasonable assumption, based on the

13

police experience in case after case, that where there

14

-- where narcotics are housed, there is often a gun and

15

there is ease of disposal, couldn't the police simply

16

say this is a narcotics search and therefore we don't

17

need to knock and announce because those circumstances

18

will be present in most cases?

19

MR. MORAN:

No, because this Court

20

unanimously foreclosed that argument in Richards v.

21

Wisconsin by holding that there must be a

22

particularized showing for the particular case.

23

particularized showing I will gladly concede will be

24

easier to make in a narcotics case than it would be in

25

a -- in a stolen property case.

That

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

But it wasn't made in this case, and this

2

case comes to this Court on the posture that the

3

prosecution has conceded, at every step of the way,

4

that that particularized showing was not made here and

5

that, therefore, there was a knock and announce

6

violation.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

particularized showing of what?

9

MR. MORAN:

I'm sorry.

A

That in this particular case,

10

it's likely that the drugs would be in an easily

11

disposable situation and that the occupants would be

12

armed and ready to resist the police entry.

13

was no such showing made here.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. MORAN:

16

attempt to make such a showing.

17

And there

I --

The prosecution didn't even

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm vaguely recalling

18

cases from the court of appeals in the D.C. Circuit

19

that accepted a presumption that if there are drugs

20

around, there are likely to be firearms around.

21

you saying that that's inconsistent with the Richards

22

decision?

23

MR. MORAN:

Are

That might not be inconsistent,

24

but the -- the -- to follow that up with, therefore,

25

you can do a no-knock entry automatically is

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

inconsistent with the Richards decision.

2

The --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question?

4

As I understand it, the prosecutor conceded a violation

5

of the knock and announce rule.

6

MR. MORAN:

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
And I'm just wondering.

In

8

Michigan, since there's no adverse effect to it, do the

9

prosecutors routinely concede that there's a violation

10

because there's no point in litigating it I suppose?

11

MR. MORAN:

Well, I don't even think we get

12

that far, Justice Stevens.

13

filed.

14

except for the -- the fact that this case is pending in

15

this Court.

16

Motions to suppress aren't

There's no point filing a motion to suppress

There's no point for --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So that if the issue

17

arises, you can assume the prosecutor will always say,

18

yes, we'll assume there was a violation.

19

be no reason not to assume that.

20

MR. MORAN:

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There would

That's right.
So you'll never really

22

litigate in Michigan how far they can go before they

23

violate the rule.

24

MR. MORAN:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a dead letter in Michigan.
But I assume that lawsuits

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

are allowable if -- if knock and announce is -- is not

observed, and if you intrude upon someone in a state of

undress.

MR. MORAN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Michigan -Isn't a civil lawsuit

Michigan has a particularly

effectively impossible to sue for a -- a knock and

12

and announce violation.

I have not found a single Michigan

You can sue in Federal court under section

in which anyone has collected anything other than

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We've not

But those doctrines

22

that you're talking about would be overridden on the

23

hypothetical that you want us to be concerned about.

24

In other words, you're saying if you don't suppress the

evidence, there's going to be no incentive to comply

much.

So they're going to deliberately violate

protect them to the extent that any reasonable officer

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait a minute.

The

government is not arguing here that -- that it's valid.
It's just arguing that though it is invalid, the
punishment for it should not be to let the criminal go.
That's -- that's all they're saying.

17

MR. MORAN:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That -- that is their argument.
The punishment for the

19

invalidity should not be the -- the inadmissibility of

20

all of the evidence of the crime that was found.

21

MR. MORAN:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That -Well, that's quite different

23

from saying that it's -- that it's valid.

I assume -And sometimes he may be

going into the wrong house and the person suing him may

7

not be a criminal, but may be some -- some innocent --

8

innocent bystander.

9

And -- and what about -- you know, you say

10

there's no incentive to knock and announce.

11

there may -- you don't know any Michigan cases in which

12

a -- a civil suit has succeeded, but I know numerous

13

cases in which police who -- who burst in without

14

knocking and announcing expose themselves to danger,

15

that is, to being shot at by a -- by a householder who

16

doesn't know that they are the police.

17

enough of -- of an incentive, the fact that you may

18

lose your life?

19

MR. MORAN:

There --

Isn't that

No, Your Honor, because I think

what some officers will do is exactly what Officer Good

21

did in this case, which is shout police and then burst

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MORAN:

I think as a practical matter,

2

that if the police are just very slightly on the wrong

3

side of the line, the courts are not likely to hold

4

that there was a knock and announce violation.

5

when you have a flagrant violation like here --

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But

Then you're -- you're

contradicting the premise.
MR. MORAN:

Well, in a case like -- in a --

if a court were to hold that the police did violate the

10

knock and announce requirement by coming in -- by

11

coming in, by not giving the person a reasonable amount

12

of time to come to the door or to make himself

13

presentable, then yes, the evidence should be

14

suppressed because those officers need to be deterred.

15

The -- the exclusionary rule is all about deterrence,

16

and is there any method that will deter officers from

17

violating the knock and announce requirement other than

18

excluding the evidence by teaching them through example

19

that next time you need to wait longer?

20

wait a reasonable amount of time for someone to come to

21

the door unless you have facts suggesting that waiting

22

a reasonable amount of time would defeat the purposes

23

of the search.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

assume that -- that police departments, even if you

2

have some maverick officers, that the administration of

3

the police department teaches them that they have to

knock and announce.

5

then you do have a 1983 cause of action against the

6

city, not just the officers.

7

that's a deep pocket.

Or if it doesn't teach them that,

You -- you know, I'm the

A search warrant, a judicial command, must be

5

not the invasion of privacy which should not have

occurred that is commanded by the warrant.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if a valid warrant

And you -- you concede that

8

there was error in execution here?

9

there was a violation because -- technically because

10

You concede that

there was no knock?

11

MR. BAUGHMAN:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.
Why do you concede that?

13

You've got a case in which, as I understand it, not

14

only was the evidence but the warrant itself an

15

indication not only that drugs were present, but that

16

guns were present.

17

general rule that anytime you do a drug search, you can

18

do a no-knock, but in this case you had specific

19

evidence that there were firearms there.

20

what I've seen in the case, I don't know why Michigan

21

did not argue that, in fact, it was justified to go in

22

without knocking.

23

It's perfectly true we don't have a

And based on

And I'll be candid to say you -- to tell you

24

that the fact that Michigan does not make that argument

25

suggests to me that Michigan is trying to structure a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

case in which it's going to have the best shot to -- to

2

get the exclusionary rule out of the way here.

3

don't you claim that the search was lawful?

4

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Why

Well, let me first say this

5

case was not structured to try -- to try to -- to get

6

it here on our -- on our part.

7

prosecutor handling the hearing here reached the

8

conclusion that Richards precluded an argument that a

9

no -- that the failure to knock and announce was

10
11

justified here.

I think initially the

But --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, Richards precluded a

12

general rule, but it didn't preclude you from arguing

13

in a specific case, and it's the fact that the

14

prosecutor and, hence, all the way up the line to you

15

do not argue that is -- is what I don't understand.

16

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, again, I -- I think it

17

would be an interesting argument to revisit Richards on

18

this proposition.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't think we have to

20

revisit Richards.

21

what I'm concerned is that you don't make an argument

22

based on the evidence in this case that you had

23

probable cause to believe that there were going to be

24

guns facing you when -- when you went in the door and

25

therefore the knock was not required.

I -- I think what -- what I'm --

1

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Again, I think the -- the

2

belief of the prosecutors, as the case went forward,

3

was that because that belief, the -- you're correct.

4

Guns were described as things to be seized in the

5

warrant.

6

specific knowledge about a gun in the house.

7

the officer's general experience that when I execute

8

search warrants for drugs, guns tend to be there.

9

Richards seems to say, at least it certainly could be

The probable cause for that was not any
It was

decision based on experience that drugs and guns go

12

together.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You can't make that

Well, are you suggesting --

did -- did the warrant -- I don't know this.

MR. BAUGHMAN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, it did.

Well, are you

19

suggesting that the -- the gun portion of the

20

authorization was, in fact, invalid?

21

I should

MR. BAUGHMAN:

No.

I -- I don't because I

believe probable cause can be based on the experience

of officers --

of the --

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If -- so -- in any case, at

3

-- at the moment that you got the warrant, you -- you

4

had, in fact, a -- a finding by a trial court, or a --

5

whoever the issuing magistrate was, that there was

6

probable cause to believe that you were going to

7

confront guns as well as drugs inside.

8

Richards does not seem to me to be a good reason, under

9

those circumstances, to concede that you didn't have a

10

And -- and

basis for -- for dispensing with the knock.

11

MR. BAUGHMAN:

It may not have been a good

12

reason, but it was the reason in that the prosecutors

13

believed that the rejection of the drugs and guns

14

always go together as a justifying -- not knocking

15

and announcing in Richards meant that the determination

16

in this case that guns were on the premises based on

17

the officer's experience that drugs and guns go

18

together, not any specific knowledge about a gun was

19

inadequate then to forgive knocking and announcing.

20

That may have been a misjudgment, but it was a belief

21

that Richards foreclosed that.

22

to set the case up.

23

25

It was not an attempt

there's known to be guns plus drugs, the police will

that's the case.

that there are guns on the premises, yes, absolutely.

MR. BAUGHMAN:

All right.

I would be happy to -- to, in

6

a different case, make the argument that although

7

Richards says a court cannot say that knock and

8

announce is forgiven every time a drug warrant is

9

executed on the theory that experience teaches that

10

drugs and guns go together.

11

that holding does not apply when a judge determines, in

12

issuing the warrant, that drugs and guns go together,

13

so I'm putting it in the warrant.

argue that case.

At this time --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

about the practice in Michigan?

1

Stevens and People against Vasquez have been decided,

2

are there any cases, other than this one, in which a

3

prosecutor has raised the knock and announce argument

4

that got litigated all the way to the appellate court?

5

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Yes, there have been a handful

6

of cases where defense attorneys have filed a motion,

7

despite People v. Stevens, and then they -- they have

8

lost because of Stevens.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So but there really is no

10

incentive for the prosecutor to fight -- argue about

11

this anymore in Michigan, is there?

12

MR. BAUGHMAN:

No.

Not, in the criminal

case, the prosecutor is responsible -- be, as it was in

14

this case, although the judge refused to follow Stevens

15

--

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, it concedes there's a

violation.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

-- there should be no hearing.

They're not conceding the violation.

They're simply

20

saying the -- a violation is irrelevant to the question

21

of the admission of the evidence, so we should not

22

litigate it.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I think one could also make

that there are not a lot of reported decisions may mean

14

there's not a lot of violations going on, that the

police are not routinely kicking down doors without

why they're not being sued.

found computer monitors in the home, the -- this Court

MR. BAUGHMAN:

-- that I -- that I hope might

make the point.

15

it's common in human experience that things can be

16

accomplished either by command or by permission when

the manner of doing so, the manner in which they end up

18

being accomplished is subject to criticism.

give a couple quick examples.

It is -- and my -- my belief is --

And let me

If, when she was young, I sent my daughter to

21

her room -- and that was rare, but if I sent her to her

22

room and she stomped up the stairs and slammed the

door, she would be in further difficulty not because

24

she carried out my command by going to her room, but

25

because she stomped up the stairs.

If a young athlete is told by his coach,

2

catch the ball with two hands and he catches it with

one, he is admonished not because he caught the ball

And if a football player taunts the opposing

team as he crosses the goal line, he gets a penalty not

7

because he crossed the goal line, but because he

taunted the other team.

It's not

These are not prerequisites.

They're rules of

conduct.

and behave in this manner while doing it.

They are principles of behavior.

It's not do

And if you

don't behave in the manner we have prescribed, the

11

question is what flows from that misbehavior, not from

the achievement of the end.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me that your

15

to knock and announce.

MR. BAUGHMAN:

That's correct, and -- and the

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And so there should be a

20

deterrent for the stomping up the stairs, and you've

21

got no deterrent for the knock and announce.

22

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, and part of what -- part

23

of what I wanted to say also to Justice Breyer and I

24

think also works here is it's -- the suggestion seems

25

to be that knock -- that a Fourth Amendment violation

To me that would be a dramatic
This Court has

We first ask whether there has been a
constitutional violation and then we say -- this Court

10

has said the premise for application of the

11

exclusionary sanction is whether or not the challenged

evidence is the product of the illegal government

activity.

14

constitutional error, the question becomes is the

And the question that I think we face when we

say is the later search the product of the entry, is --

5

is what your -- what -- I think a point that -- that

point.

his answer is -- and I think the -- the answer of the

cases that Justice Breyer was -- was referring to -- is

It's a pragmatic

to respond to it in a way that will deter the no-knock

What is fallacious about that argument?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

There's nothing fallacious

20

about the argument if one accepts that excluding the

21

truth in -- in a criminal proceeding is a fair tradeoff

22

in that circumstance --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We do that every single time

we exclude a piece of evidence in every suppression

17

MR. SALMONS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Suppression would not be an appropriate

18

remedy in this context for two primary reasons.

19

first is if the knock and announce rule does not

20

protect the individual's privacy interest in the

21

underlying items seized and, instead, it seeks to limit

22

discrete risks related to the execution of warrants

23

that property will be damaged, that officers will be

24

mistaken for intruders, or that occupants will be

25

caught in embarrassing situations.

Amendment requirements related to the manner of

executing warrants such as --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, what -- what do you

5

say to Justice Breyer's argument that we haven't

6

previously analyzed suppression by tracing or trying to

7

trace the causal connection between a particular piece

8

of evidence and a particular reason for the rule that

9

was broken?

What we have said in the past is if the

10

rule or the standard is violated and the search is

11

therefore unreasonable, the evidence doesn't come in.

12

You're proposing a -- a different causal

13

analysis.

14

requires the connection between a piece of evidence and

15

the particular reason for one of these standards in

16

every case in which suppression is -- is requested.

17

You're proposing a causal analysis that

Number one, do you agree that that -- that

would be a departure, as Justice Breyer suggested?

It's common, when you have a

chain of causal connection, to say it ends somewhere.

It's common, and in Harris, it ended once they left the

9

MR. SALMONS:

10

But --

JUSTICE BREYER:

This isn't over in the

11

station.

12

but this doesn't interests.

13

This is in the home.

What about Boyd?

You speak of interests,

I mean, the most famous

14

statement in Fourth Amendment history to all invasions

15

on the part of the government and its employees of the

16

sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.

17

is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of

18

his drawers that constitutes the essence of the

19

offense.

20

right of personal security, personal liberty, and

21

private property.

2

it?

3

MR. SALMONS:

I mean, doesn't that describe

No, Your Honor.

I mean,

4

certainly that's -- that is one of the principles

5

underlying the Fourth Amendment, but this Court has

6

looked to the types of considerations I'm discussing,

7

and I will give you some examples.

8

fact, the knock and announce rule is very analogous to

9

-- for example, to a claim of unnecessary property

10

damage or to a claim that the officers brought the

11

media along when they shouldn't or that they used

12

excessive force.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And we think, in

There's no doubt in

14

here that an invasion of the home was authorized by the

15

warrant.

Right?

16

MR. SALMONS:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's correct.
The interest we're

talking about is not the sanctity of the drawers.

That might be --

20

and I don't have a warrant here that allows me to come

21

in without knocking.

22

I don't have a warrant that allows me to

So where's the warrant?

MR. SALMONS:

I think the question in that

23

case, Your Honor, would be about reasonable reliance on

24

the warrant and whether it was a reasonable mistake.

25

And if it wasn't, then it would be a warrantless

search.

2

And if I may just focus the Court --

3

attention on the claim of unnecessary property damage.

4

We think that's quite analogous here in part because

5

the typical -- in the typical case, a premature or

6

unannounced entry will be a forcible entry.

7

whether the claim is that the officers entered a few

8

moments prematurely or that they unnecessarily used a

9

battering ram on the door, in either case the -- the

But

10

violation doesn't relate to the privacy interests and

11

the items to be seized and shouldn't result in

12

suppression.

13

And in addition to that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it does relate to the

14

privacy interests, and we've seen the explanation.

15

of the reasons for requiring the knock is that there is

16

enough respect for a person's home, a person's privacy

17

to say the police should not barge in like an invading

18

army.

19

MR. SALMONS:

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21
22
23

25

One

Well, that certainly is -That is a respect for

privacy.

Your Honor, but that -- that is not a protection -JUSTICE SOUTER:

2

MR. SALMONS:

No, Your Honor.

The point of

3

knock and announce is a more limited privacy.

4

related to the privacy of the items to be seized.

5

That's separate.

6

claim of unnecessary --

7

It's not

And that's why it makes it like the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We're talking about the

8

privacy of individual in his home, and the

9

reasonableness of the search depends upon the

10

reasonableness of invading the individual's privacy in

11

his home.

12

Is that not the general rule?
MR. SALMONS:

No, Your Honor.

I think what

13

-- what focuses in terms of suppression is whether the

14

government has obtained an evidentiary advantage as a

15

consequence of the illegality.

16

was the failure to delay a few additional moments

17

before entry.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Here, the illegality

Then there will never be a

19

suppression of -- of evidence specified in a warrant

20

when the warrant's no-knock component is violated --

21

MR. SALMONS:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But --- because we -- we will say

23

-- in every single time, following your argument, you

24

will -- we will say the -- the violation had nothing to

25

do with the authorization to seize the evidence.

The

60
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

violation simply had to do with the -- with the -- the

2

niceties and the risks involved in entering.

3

accept your argument, no-knock is -- is a dead duck,

4

isn't it?

5

MR. SALMONS:

So if we

I don't think so, Your Honor.

6

If I may try to explain.

7

with regard to physical evidence in the home that's

8

within the scope of the search warrant, that you're --

9

you're probably right.

10
11

I think as a general matter,

Most of the time, that evidence

will come in.
We think that there are probably at least two

12

areas that might lead to suppression in these cases.

13

One is the -- the type of statements that the Chief

14

Justice mentioned earlier.

15

might call proximity evidence, that the officers went

16

in prematurely and as a result, they saw a --

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Another might be what you

this -- this question?

21

would you have conceded that there was a constitutional

22

violation in this case?

-- there may be in the court of appeals.

2

way that the Court would analyze that would be, again,

3

along the same lines.

4

I think the

Now, certainly in jurisdictions that haven't

5

adopted the rule that we're articulating here, the

6

courts may suppress.

7

we're articulating, that suppression probably would not

8

be appropriate there.

9

But we think under the principles

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but apparently you're

10

saying we would not suppress because as long as the

11

warrant specified the items to be seized and they

12

didn't go beyond that, there was no causal connection

13

between the fact that they broke in and disturbed

14

people in the night, when they were not authorized to,

15

and their ultimate obtaining of -- of the evidence.

16

Once again, it seems to me if we follow your -- your

17

reasoning, then the distinction between the nighttime

18

and the daytime warrant is a dead letter.

19

MR. SALMONS:

Well, you know, we respectfully

20

disagree with that.

21

separate questions, what the Constitution requires and

22

whether suppression is an appropriate remedy.

We think that there are two

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The Constitution requires a

2

reasonable search.

3

no-knock, violating nighttime searches when only a

4

daytime search is authorized amounts to an unreasonable

5

search.

6

because there's no causal connection between that

7

violation and the seizure of the particular items that

8

the warrant -- the warrant specified.

9

It is hornbook law that violating

You're saying that's utterly irrelevant

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, if I may.

It's

10

also hornbook law now in this Court that you can't

11

unnecessarily destroy property in executing the warrant

12

or effecting the entry and that you can't bring the

13

media along.

14

This Court in both Ramirez and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'd to get your -- I'd like

15

to get your position.

correct, that under the theory you're arguing to us

17

here, the violation of the daytime warrant rule is not

18

grounds for suppressing evidence.

19

20

MR. SALMONS:

I -- I think Justice Souter is

So we can have

Well, I -- I think that's

21

probably the position that we would take.

22

way the Court would analyze that, as it has done in

these other cases, it would look to two factors.

rule that's violated and how well those purposes fit

that where an authority given by law is exceeded, the
