ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL T. KIRKPATRICK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In Mullane, this Court held that due process

11

requires that notice efforts conform to what a person

12

who actually desires to provide notice would do under

13

the circumstances.

14

blind eye to the return of an initial mailed notice,

15

but would consider reasonable follow-up steps to

16

provide that notice.

17

Such a person would not turn a

Where valuable real property is at stake and

18

the State learns that its initial effort has failed,

19

the State should do two things.

20

search readily available sources for a better mailing

21

address and resend the notice, and second, if a better

22

address cannot be readily ascertained or the second

23

notice also fails, the State should post a notice on

24

the property or contact the occupants.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

First, it should

Mr. Kirkpatrick, I don't

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

recall what -- what the rule is.

2

be given by registered mail?

3

adequate notice in the -- in the ordinary case to send

4

notice by regular mail?

5

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Does notice have to

Would it -- would it be

Justice Scalia, in a case

6

like this where there's valuable real property, regular

7

mail would not be sufficient to comply with due

8

process, and the reason why is this.

9

person who actually desires to give notice will use

A reasonable

10

certified mail for the information that comes back to

11

the sender.

12

has been received and they can stop with confidence, or

13

they know that they have failed and there's still time

14

to take reasonable follow-up steps.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

Then the sender either knows the notice

Yes, but do we have a case

that says that, you have to use registered mail?

17

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, Your Honor.
I didn't think we did.

And

19

it would seem to me that especially when you have the

20

taxpayer's name and address on file, I doubt whether it

21

would be a denial of due process to send notice by

22

regular mail to that address.

23

satisfies due process, the State would never have known

24

that it did not reach the individual.

25

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

And if -- if that

Justice Scalia --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it seems -- it seems

2

mean to punish the State for going the extra mile and

3

sending the notice by registered mail because that

4

informed them that it didn't reach him.

5

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Yes, but Justice Scalia,

6

the State, once informed that the letter had never

7

reached Mr. Jones, did nothing.

8

indifferent to the information that came back.

9

fact, what the State did here was no better than

The State was
So, in

10

sending regular mail because they ignored the

11

information that came back from the use of certified

12

mail.

13

might have been better for Mr. Jones.

14
15

And, in fact, had they used regular mail, it

Now, we're here in this case to discuss what
due process --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

mail.

Why?
Well -In Mullane, it was regular

It wasn't certified mail.

20

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Right?

Yes, that's correct.
And isn't it 100 percent

22

clear that there were a number of those addressees who

23

didn't get the letter?

24
25

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg,

that's correct, but --

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And yet, their interests

2

were cut out by the decision, and the Court said that

3

was okay.

4

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Well, the context was very

5

different in Mullane because in Mullane there was a

6

large number of interested parties with very small

7

interests in a trust, and what they were being given

8

notice of was an accounting to settle those trusts.

9

And as long as some of the people who were similarly

10

situated received notice, they could act in a way that

11

would protect other members of the class.

12

Here, we're talking about real property with

13

just a single owner, and in this case, where we have an

14

$80,000 house that was lost and sold for only $21,000,

15

it would seem to me that due process would require more

16

than just regular mail.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you have another

18

factor here that wasn't present in Mullane; that is,

19

the person who received notice has a statutory

20

obligation to advise government of the current address.

21

The people involved in Mullane had no such obligation

22

to notify anybody of their current address.

23

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

That's correct, Justice

24

Ginsburg.

25

government must use reasonable diligence to ascertain

But what Mullane announced is that the

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

an address where it can be found.

2

don't quarrel --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this case, we

It wasn't the government

in -- in Mullane it wasn't the government.

5

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Well, that's right.

The --

6

the party charged with giving notice in Mullane had an

7

obligation --

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

How do -- how do we -- I

mean, this was the problem I -- I had with -- with your

10

-- your brief here, and it's the same problem Justice

11

Ginsburg has.

12

do we give to this obligation to keep the government

13

informed?

14

What kind of weight, what significance

On the face of it, it seems like a -- an

15

obligation that ought to get considerable weight.

16

Everybody knows that if you own real estate, you've got

17

to pay real estate taxes on it.

18

hard time doing that if they don't know where to send

19

the bill, and so on.

20

reasonable obligation for the government to put on you.

21
22
23

You're going to have a

So it seems like a very

What weight do we give that in -- in the
analysis?
MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Justice Souter, I think it

24

is given weight when we evaluate the reasonableness of

25

the initial notice effort, and we do not quarrel with

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the State first sending notice by certified mail to the

2

last address in the State property records.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And then that would be so

4

even if there were no affirmative obligation on the

5

property owner.

6

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.
You'd say, well, if they --

8

if they send the -- the notice to the last address they

9

had, or if they send it -- since we're talking about

10

real estate, maybe if they send it to the -- to the

11

property, nothing wrong with that.

12

wash.

13
14

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

So that's kind of a

Justice Souter, I think

that there are a couple of points that need to be made.

15

One is that Mr. Jones' failure to update his

16

address did not relieve the State of its constitutional

17

obligation.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

But I want to know what

19

Mr. -- I mean, it does not relieve it of some

20

constitutional obligation, and we're trying to figure

21

out what that is.

22

is in figuring out what it is, what significance do we

23

give to the affirmative obligation on the part of the

24

property owner to keep the government informed of the

25

address?

And -- and the point of my question

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

The answer is once the

2

State was informed that the first mailed notice had

3

failed, it gets no significance.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

Then -- then it

5

has no significance ever because the -- the State has

6

an obligation to use the best address it has, whether

7

he's got an obligation to -- to keep the address

8

updated or not.

9

point for me with your case.

And -- and this is the -- the tough
It seems to me that your

10

case depends on our saying the obligation to keep the

11

-- the address current has absolutely no significance.

12

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Justice Souter, it has no

13

significance once the State is actually informed that

14

the notice has failed because I think the significance

15

of the statute is it increases the State's confidence

16

in the address that it's initially using.

17

certified mail comes back unclaimed, at that point it

18

knows that the address from 1967 in its records and the

19

statutory obligation to update the address, that is

20

outweighed by actual knowledge that in both 2000 and

21

2003 the certified mail notices were not received.

22

But once the

I'd like to go back to Justice Ginsburg's

23

first question about why regular mail might actually

24

have been better in this case.

25

sent, we don't know what would have happened.

Had regular mail been
We might

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not have had a due process challenge because the

2

envelope would have ended up in the mailbox at Bryan

3

Street.

4

occupants, and they may very well have brought it to

5

Mr. Jones' attention, the way they did when they

6

received the eviction notice after the redemption

7

period had closed.

It would have been brought inside by the

8
9

But I think the most important factor, even
if we don't agree on whether certified mail was

10

required by the Constitution in the first instance, is

11

that once the government used certified mail, it cannot

12

then ignore the information that it gained as a result

13

of that choice.

14

This --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And he also had a

15

continuing obligation to inform the government of his

16

address.

17

One fact about this case that -- perhaps it

18

was in the record and I missed it.

19

property was sold, how much did Mr. Jones owe, taking

20

account of the back taxes, the interest, the penalties,

21

all that?

22

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

At the time the

Approximately $6,000

23

because the property was sold for $21,000.

24

bid was the assessed value of the property, which in

25

Arkansas is 20 percent of the fair market value.

The minimum

So

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that was about $14,000.

2

taxes, another 10 percent in interest, and another 10

3

percent in penalties, and some small, in this instance,

4

costs of notice.

5

Plus about $4,000 in back

But that brings us to an important point, is

6

that the cost of notice and the cost of a search to

7

find a better address will not be borne by the State.

8

It will be borne either by the owner as a cost of

9

redeeming the property or it will be borne by the

10

purchaser as a cost of acquiring the property.

11

certainly here where we have an $80,000 house sold for

12

$21,000, there was sufficient margin to allow for some

13

costs to find Mr. Jones so that he could be informed

14

without making this property --

15
16

JUSTICE BREYER:

How did they find him, by

the way?

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

22

So

Would you tell me --- how in your opinion?
Oh, excuse me.
How did they find him?
The purchaser served an

eviction notice to the property --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

I'm not saying how did

24

they?

25

Department or the government have found him?

How in your opinion should the Post Office

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

They should have searched

2

three categories of sources for a better address and

3

then tried mail again.

4

the State's own records, such as the driver's license

5

records or voter registration rolls; second, public

6

directories like the phone book or an Internet search

7

engine; and third, they should have considered using

8

commercial services such as those that are used by

9

creditors.

And those three categories are

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

May I ask -So they find 13 people

12

called Gary Jones or G. Jones in Little Rock.

13

what do they do?

14

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Two things.

Now,

One is they

15

can look for the Gary Jones that has some tie to the

16

Bryan Street address, and certainly --

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18

question?

19

constitutionally mandated?

20

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

21
22
23
24
25

May I interrupt with this

Do you think all those steps were

No.

I think what is

constitutionally -JUSTICE STEVENS:

What was constitutionally

mandated in your view?
MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Reasonably diligent efforts

to ascertain a correct address after the return of the

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

first certified mail and how far --

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you would not include

3

posting on the -- posting a notice on the house as

4

constitutionally mandated.

5

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Justice Stevens, I would.

6

First, I think that the State can search for a better

7

address by mail.

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, they can -- they can do --

9

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Yes.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- a lot things.

11

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

But --

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm trying to decide what

13
14

they must do.
MR. KIRKPATRICK:

With real property, if the

15

owner has not been notified by mail, absolutely I think

16

they should post notice on the property.

17

traditional way --

18
19
20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That is a

Would that be

constitutionally sufficient if they posted a notice?
MR. KIRKPATRICK:

It would be

21

constitutionally sufficient if they posted a notice

22

because they could not ascertain a better address.

23
24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, now so it would not

be constitutionally sufficient if that's all they did.
MR. KIRKPATRICK:

That's correct.

And I

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

think that's --

2
3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

constitutional minimum that would be sufficient?

4
5

So what is the

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Reasonably diligent efforts

to find a better address and if a better address --

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It would be decided on a

7

case-by-case basis depending on the particular facts in

8

the case.

9

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Well, this Court in

10

Schroeder v. City of New York, I think, recognized that

11

it's impossible to have a mechanical rule to apply in

12

every circumstance.

13

I do think, though, that the --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And your opponent argues

14

very persuasively the mechanical rules are very

15

important in this particular area of government

16

business.

17

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Well, they are, but in this

18

case, the State knew within 2 weeks of sending the

19

initial mailed notice that it had not been received.

20

That was 3 years before the taking.

21

sufficient time for the State to take some very minimal

22

efforts to provide notice.

23

So there was

And remember, with regard to posting, in this

24

case the State actually visited the Bryan Street

25

property and they did not post a notice or contact the

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

occupants at that time, although they could have done

2

so for virtually no cost at all, no additional effort.

3

And we know from what happened with the eviction

4

notice that had they taken that very minimal effort to

5

post the notice, it would have worked.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I take it in -- in this

7

case -- I mean, I -- you're probably right that it

8

would have -- it would have worked here, but I -- I

9

take it that in the absence of that -- that hindsight,

10

you would say that in -- in the regular case that

11

simply posting notice on the house, after the letter is

12

returned, would not be enough, that the -- that the

13

posting on the house would be sufficient only if they

14

had exhausted other efforts to get a better address so

15

that in this case, going back to Justice Breyer's

16

example, they -- they'd have to follow up whatever it

17

is, the 18 G. Joneses or Gary Joneses that they could

18

find in the phone book before they could then fall back

19

and resort to posting on the house.

20

understand you correctly?

21

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Is -- do I

Justice Souter, you do.

22

That -- that is our -- our point, but I would like to

23

qualify that slightly.

24
25

In -- if the search does not, with reasonably
diligent efforts, turn up a better address or if

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there's a better address and the letter comes back, I

2

think at that point it's perfectly reasonable to stop

3

searching for an address, to give up on mailed notice,

4

and at that point post the property because getting --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the search of

6

-- the search of what?

7

of Arkansas?

8

They -- he'd be out of luck under your approach then.

9

Just Little Rock or the State

What if this guy had moved to Chicago?

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Well, if they contracted

10

with a credit bureau, for example, or a skip tracer, it

11

is quite easy to find people that have moved across the

12

country, much easier today than it was, you know, years

13

ago because technology has really expanded the amount

14

of information that is readily ascertainable.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How many people -Does -- does it follow from

17

your argument that someone who purchases at a tax sale,

18

before they conclude the purchase, should find out what

19

the State has done?

20
21
22

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Justice Kennedy, that would

be a reasonable way to have a statutory scheme.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the purchaser from that

23

purchaser the same.

24

sold to X, then X has to make the same inquiry because

25

he sees I guess what, a quit claim deed or a tax sale.

In other words, if Flowers had

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

So before a purchaser can purchase from Flowers, that

2

purchaser too must see whether or not they hired an

3

outside agency and so forth.

4
5
6

MR. KIRKPATRICK:
that.

It might be prudent to do

I think that one -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, isn't it required to

7

do that under your title, if you're going to have your

8

title set aside by Jones?

9

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Yes, although if the title

10

is set aside, Ms. Flowers will receive a full refund of

11

all the money that she's paid, and that's under the

12

Arkansas statutory scheme.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14
15
16
17

purchaser from Jones?

Well, what about the

If -- pardon me -- from Flowers.

If Flowers has spent the money, then that purchaser is
out of luck.
MR. KIRKPATRICK:

That may be correct and I

18

think when somebody goes to purchase property and they

19

find out that title insurance is not available because

20

of the tax sale deed, they have to consider the

21

potential exposure.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So one of the consequences

23

of your rule is to devalue any property sold by the

24

government because it is open to this kind of challenge

25

for deficiency in title.

So you've now devalued the

17
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

property in the hands of the State.

2

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

I think only for a

3

temporary period of time because there's a 2-year

4

statute of limitations to challenge the sale and that's

5

why the State tells tax sale purchasers that they

6

should not make expensive improvements to property

7

until that time has closed.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask, Mr. Kirkpatrick?

In Arkansas, is the tax -- tax delinquency a matter of

10

public record so a prospective purchaser would find it

11

by making a title search?

12
13
14
15
16

MR. KIRKPATRICK:
record.

It is a matter of public

I'm not sure whether -JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it could be revealed by

a title search?
MR. KIRKPATRICK:

I don't know, Your Honor,

17

whether a title search would reveal it, but certainly

18

in the county records, all of the delinquent properties

19

are entered and open to the public for inspection.

20

They may have to look in two different places.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would this case come out

22

differently?

23

obligation to keep the State informed of -- of his --

24

his address so that they could send the tax bills to

25

him, suppose the statute, in addition to simply

You know, your client had an

reciting that obligation, said, and if the taxpayer

2

does not keep the State advised of his current address,

3

any notice mailed to the last address that he gave will

4

suffice for all purposes.

5

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

explicitly.

8

come out differently?

9

Justice Scalia, I -Suppose it said that

Would that -- would that make this case

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, it would not because -Why?

I mean, the State can

11

punish people for not doing what the law tells them to

12

do, and here the State is saying we tell you to keep us

13

-- you keep us advised of your -- your address.

14

don't, I guess we could throw you in jail for half a

15

year, but no, we're not going to do that.

16

going to say that -- that your -- your punishment for

17

violating the law is that this kind of a notice will

18

suffice.

19

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

If you

We're just

Justice Scalia, I believe

20

the Federal constitutional obligation would still apply

21

regardless of whether the State of Arkansas tried to

22

legislate its way out of it.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but there -- no, but

24

this is a consequence of violating the law of -- of

25

Arkansas.

Certainly the State can impose consequences

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

for violating its law.

2

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it -You know, and my next

4

question is going to be, if you say it would come out

5

differently, then isn't -- isn't it sort of silly to

6

make the State go on and say that?

7

the same thing by simply reciting what's going to

8

happen, why -- why should we make them do that?

9

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

If they could do

I don't think that --

10

Justice Scalia, I don't think that -- if Arkansas

11

had that kind of statute, that it would make this case

12

come out differently because I think the due process

13

analysis and the application of the Mullane standard to

14

these facts where the initial mailed notice comes back

15

would be the same.

16

we're determining what is reasonable, whether or not

17

the owner complied with that statute, but I don't think

18

that Mr. Jones loses his constitutional right.

19

I think it may be a factor, when

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could they fine him for not

20

-- could they fine him for not -- for not keeping them

21

advised of -- of where -- where his tax address is?

22
23

MR. KIRKPATRICK:
criminal law they could.

24
25

I suppose as a matter of

They could.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Could they fine him $70,000?
That would seem to be a

very harsh penalty.

He lost about $70,000 worth

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's pretty harsh, but do

you think this Court would strike it down?

10

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I do.
You do.
I frankly don't see the

difference between failing to keep the State advised as

knew he had a duty to pay the taxes.

16

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

That's right.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And should not that figure

18

He

into the analysis?

19

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Justice Stevens, it should

20

not figure in at all because he still had a statutory

21

right to redeem the property, and once he had that

22

statutory right to redeem the property, due process --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

that.

25

Well, no, I understand

But doesn't -- he would know whether the taxes

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

In fact, in this case he

did not.

3

this, the mortgage company paid the taxes for 30 years.

4

After the mortgage was retired, Mr. Jones thought that

And while the record is rather sparse on

5

the occupant, Mrs. Jones, was paying the taxes.

6

mistaken in that belief and that's what happened here.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

He was

fact situation.

9

We're trying to announce a rule that
And is it not

10

true that typically the homeowner will know whether or

11

not he's paid his taxes?

12

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Typically the homeowner

13

certainly should, but we all make mistakes and

14

certainly there are lawyers --

15
16
17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But he has to make mistakes

for 2 or 3 years running before it's significant.
MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Arkansas set up a statutory

18

scheme that gave him a right to redeem up until 30 days

19

after the sale of the property.

20

-- he gets due process whether he's innocent or not

21

innocent. And I think in the case where --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That statutory right

No, but how long do the

23

taxes have to be in arrears before they can send him a

24

notice and start the proceeding running?

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

They wait until the taxes

certified from the county to the State.

3

notice saying that 2 years into the future, there will

4

be a tax sale if the property hasn't been redeemed.

5

Even after that public sale, there's a 30-day

6

redemption period.

7

At that time, it's

So then we started an entirely new

10

notice and ultimately the property was sold at

14

So there is sufficient time after the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

of Arkansas Supreme Court, is that there are 18,000 tax

2

But what we do know is that 85 percent of tax

delinquent properties in Arkansas are redeemed by the

owner either before the tax sale or within 30 days

after.

So we don't know how many notices came back

1

letters did not actually come to the house.

2

three delivery attempts for each letter, but the

3

letters themselves -- nobody was at home during the day

4

when the letter carrier came by.

5

themselves were not left.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

There were

So the letters

Did they leave a notice?
If the letter carrier

8

followed proper procedures, a notice would have been

9

left, but there's nothing in the record to indicate one

10

way or the other whether that happened.

11

But at most, that notice would say that there

12

was a certified letter for Gary Jones and it may have

13

said that it was sent by the Commissioner of State

14

Lands.

15

county is who assesses the taxes.

16

might think that the Land Commissioner of Arkansas was

17

writing about the parks or the State forests or any

18

number of things.

19

Jones with knowledge that there was a tax delinquent

20

notice waiting for Mr. Jones just because, if the

21

letter carrier did what he or she should have, a notice

22

of delivery slip would have been left at the house.

23

It didn't say tax delinquent notice.

The

Many lay people

So I don't think we can charge Mrs.

But remember also that after the first notice

24

came back, it was 3 years later when they sent the

25

notice of the negotiated sale, and that was after they

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

knew that it was likely a futile gesture to send

2

certified mail to Mr. Jones at that address, and it was

3

after they had actually gone out and visited the house.

4

So at a minimum, they should have posted a

5

notice at the property.

6

Greene v. Lindsey or Schroeder v. City of New York,

7

posting was inadequate, and the Court said that mail

8

would have been better, at least here, knowing that

9

mail had not worked, even if the State chose not to

And while in some cases like

10

search for a better address, at a minimum they should

11

have posted a notice at the property and that would

12

have made all the difference in this case.

14

If there are no further questions, I'd like
to reserve my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19
20
21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
It's somewhat startling to me that in a case

22

involving the fundamental question of what notice is due

23

under the Due Process Clause, that the phrase,

24

reasonably calculated to provide notice to the affected

25

property owner, was never used in the petitioner's

26
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

submission because at least, as I remember Mullane I

2

suppose from my law school days and -- and since then,

3

that is the fundamental test.

4

State undertaken to -- to make a reasonable calculation

5

to, in fact, provide notice under these circumstances.

6

The question is has the

It's sort of startling to me in the -- in the

7

face of a decision like this Court wrote in Mennonite

8

Board, where it says explicitly, you know, the minor

9

inconvenience and administrative burden of using the

10

regular mails is a complete answer to claims that

11

something less than that should be provided.

12

And again, petitioner's counsel's first answer

13

to the question, would ordinary mail have been

14

sufficient under these circumstances, is no.

15

property like this, that's not sufficient.

16

me that -- that the Dusenbery case answers that because

17

while it was true that the mails that were sent

18

originally to the prison itself were certified, there's

19

no certification process to get the mails --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

For

It seems to

Maybe this day -- in today's

21

world, a registered letter is worse than ordinary mail.

22

That is, I don't think -- my understanding is that the

23

post office, unlike FedEx and unlike UPS, if you're not

24

home, they leave a -- a notice, you know, and you check

25

a box, and if you check the box, they'll leave it off

We've

They have appointments all morning, and

So whatever they did with Mullane and said

18

registered mail is fine, why isn't it unreasonable to

19

use that system rather than use FedEx's system?

20
21
22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, that's a pretty

remarkable due process constitutional -JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why not?

It says

23

calculated.

24

remarkable because I think I could take judicial notice

25

of what life is like for most families in the world

It may be.

Now, you tell me why it's so

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

today, that they don't have butlers, et cetera.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

I may -- I may let Mr. Feldman

3

defend the -- the Postal Service because he is the

4

Solicitor General's lawyer.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

But the reality is that for

7

the vast majority of the mails, the mails do get

8

through.

9

that if you mail something to someone --

And -- and it is a reasonable calculation

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- that it will get there and

12

it will be properly delivered.

13

purpose of the certification.

14

But --

That's the -- the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the whole point

15

-- at least I understand -- of Justice Breyer's

16

question is that you have taken a step to make it more

17

difficult for the mail to get through by insisting that

18

the person be there to sign for it, and it's obviously

19

more likely than not he's not going to be there.

20

if you had just used regular mail and dropped it off, I

21

think more likely he would have gotten it.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

And

Well, the -- the purpose of

23

using certified mail is to make sure that it actually

24

got to the person --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

The purpose of

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

certified mail is to make sure you know if it didn't

2

get to the person.

3

didn't do anything about it.

4

And you knew that and then you

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, now it works both ways,

5

though, Mr. Chief Justice, because if -- if it goes to

6

my neighbor -- let's assume numbers are transposed --

7

it goes to my neighbor and the neighbor is there and

8

sees the information, they'll say that the -- that

9

that's -- that goes to across the street.

And then you

10

take it across the street and you get it signed.

11

That's because you talked to a specific individual.

12

it is, in fact, designed to enhance the likelihood that

13

it will actually get there.

14

But I don't think the issue here is --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Wait.

Let -- let them do

16

that.

17

signs and says, tomorrow leave it at the house, just

18

like FedEx does.

Fine.

Just have a little box and the person

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21
22
23

So

And as a matter of policy, I

wouldn't necessarily disagree with that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is the FedEx rule of

due process.

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm sorry?
This is the FedEx rule of

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

due process.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's exactly what it is.

4

And as I say, as a matter of policy, Justice Breyer, I

5

wouldn't necessarily disagree with it.

6

of what the Constitution strait-jackets States to

7

provide, it strikes me as a -- as a pretty

8

extraordinary rule.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But as a matter

But is the Chief Justice

10

not correct that ordinary mail is more apt to get to

11

the destination than certified mail?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

only at a -- at a marginal number.

Well, if it is, it's probably

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16
17

My guess is --

But even if it's marginal --

-- the percentages are very

small.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- the -- the principal

18

purpose of the certified mail is to let the sender know

19

whether or not the notice was received.

20

that a State that decides to -- to make it necessary in

21

every case to find that answer should have some -- some

22

purpose in doing so and -- and, therefore, some follow-

23

up that would occur when it's not delivered.

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

It would seem

Well, except for this problem

-- I mean, the other problem you have is that we don't

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- all we know is that it wasn't -- it -- it came back

2

unclaimed.

So we don't even know that it didn't get

3

delivered.

All we know is that no one was prepared to

4

sign for it and accept it.

5
6

We don't know, as Justice Breyer's
hypothetical --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, but you also know

8

that nobody got the notice.

9

and took it, nobody read the letter.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

If nobody signed for it

Well, you could look at the --

11

you could look at the outside and say, I'm not going to

12

sign for this, and it's unclaimed.

13
14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, you would know that

the letter was not opened and read by the addressee.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, to be sure, I know that

16

it wasn't opened and read, but all I'm saying is that

17

what we don't -- we don't even know --

18
19

JUSTICE STEVENS:
read --

20
21

And if it isn't opened and

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- that Justice Breyer is

correct.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- if it isn't opened and

23

read, they didn't get notice.

24

notice.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

They didn't get actual

2

that there's no constitutional requirement that they

3

receive actual notice.

And, of course, this Court has routinely said

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask one other

5

question I intended to ask your opponent?

6

States have rules that require something more?

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

How many

I -- I think in their reply

8

brief at least, they make an effort, and we didn't go

9

and -- and do a 50-State survey between a week ago and

10

now to find out.

11

States do.

12

But, you know, a fair number of

I -- I would say 15, 20.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Including -- including

14

requires if you -- if it's unclaimed, they have to do

15

personal service?

demonstrates the wisdom of Justice Brandeis' reference

21

to the small laboratories because what we -- what we

22

have here are a raft of different approaches that the

23

States take to give either more or less notice so long

24

as you satisfy the constitutional minimum.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The problem --

publication in a local newspaper.

MR. PHILLIPS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
Why do you bother

doing that?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, in part because we --

7

we're putting out a notice to the public that we're

8

selling the property.

9

notifies that there's a sale to take place.

So it serves two purposes.

It also

10

identifies the landowner, giving -- or the property

11

owner one more opportunity --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It

You don't -- you

13

don't rely on that as in any way discharging your

constitutional obligation to provide notice to the --

to the homeowner.

wouldn't suffice.

The Court has decided that a long

But I think as an -- as an additional

20

component, if you -- if you really want to get into the

21

totality of the circumstances rather than what I think

22

is the better rule, which is to say, as you evaluate

23

what we did, was it reasonably calculated to provide

24

notice, and conclude, yes, it was reasonably calculated

25

to provide notice under this Court's rulings that

would win there.

3

If you go beyond that and say, well, no, you

4

have to do something-plus, if you go down the

5

reasonably diligent efforts kind of an approach, I

6

would say then don't go any further than say that

7

you're required to publish the fact of the sale itself

because to go beyond that is -- is to open this.

just send ordinary mail?

I think if the Court were to

a rule.

about -- you know, I was thinking precisely the same,

have the FedEx rule or send a letter.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

It sounds like you're

legislating, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, because the purpose is

21

to get reasonably calculated to get notice, and in the

22

world today, there are an awful lot of houses where

23

nobody is home, you know, and there's no convenient way

24

for them to go to the post office without giving up a

25

certain amount of work.

And so they say, forget it.

If it comes from the lands division or something, who

cares?

many there are like that, but it's a question of

4

reasonable calculation now to get the mail through.

5

Now, that -- I don't know how you'd know how

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it seems to me, Justice

6

Breyer, you're adopting a rule that's designed to

7

protect a very, very tiny minority and to impose a

8

burden, a significant burden, on every State.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it a tiny minority --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not even sure it

11

protects that minority.

12

people who won't be home when the -- when the postman

13

comes with the -- with the registered letter, but there

14

are very few who -- who won't take the trouble to -- to

15

pick it up.

16

I think there are a lot of

I mean, it may be --

MR. PHILLIPS:

And -- and the flip side of

17

that is there's nothing that indicates why even -- even

18

the person -- if somebody is unwilling to go -- to take

19

the time to find out what the Commissioner of Lands in

20

the State has sent a certified letter for, why is it --

21

why would you assume that whenever the letter comes in

22

when it's addressed to Mr. Jones, that Mrs. Jones isn't

23

going to toss it aside just as quickly?

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

that indicates one way or the other what -- what is a

2

preferable system to operate.

this is intensely a legislative judgement.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it's, you know, one, not a

But two, I think at the end of the day, the

16

answer is you can't put the burden on the State to

17

understand the -- the precise situation of each of the

18

individual homeowners, that they have some duties

19

because they know, one, they do owe taxes; two, in

20

Arkansas they should know that they owe us a duty to

21

keep us up-to-date with respect to their situation, and

22

where -- and where it is that we can reach them.

23

so it's reasonable to impose those duties --

satisfied because notice will, in fact, be received.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But your -- your

position is, though, when you get the certified

letter returned is you have no obligation to do

anything further.

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's correct, because --

because the difficulty is once you go past that, what

-- what obligation you have becomes completely

10
11

unknowable at that stage.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it seems to me that

12

even you might not have an obligation, it seemed to me

13

you would have a motivation to do more because you want

to collect your taxes.

it's significantly undermines the State's overall

effort in trying to get its money back because it's all

5

well and good to say we can sell the property, but if

6

nobody is going to pay for the property anything that

7

comes close to the value of even getting our liens paid

8

off, then we're not going to get the revenue stream

9

that we would otherwise be entitled to.

And even if

10

you, you know, go through the -- through the kind of

11

machinations of --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, you would get the

13

whole -- you'd just get a little bit less because the

14

cost of notice is borne by the purchaser and if they

15

have to do a Google search or use one of these other

16

services, it's going to add a little bit more to their

cost, and you're just going to get a little bit less.

18

It's not going to interfere with the administration of

19

the program.

worth taking at least 2 seconds to focus on the market

13

immediately.

14

number that was significantly higher than what the

15

value of this property is.

16

And

And so they had every incentive to say a

The best evidence of what the value of this

property is is around the $20,000 that a real purchaser

put on the table in order to purchase it.

here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, no.

That's

-- Mr. Phillips, property bought at -- at delinquent

tax sales is usually bought at far less than its market

$80,000 as the relevant number here is a number that's

picked out of the air for a purpose that has nothing to

to stop the transfer of possession of the property in

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It has to do with the value

Your -- your friend said

11

that the $80,000 comes from the fact that it -- at the

-- at the auction, it -- the opening bid is one-quarter

13

of the fair market value.

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

He said something like that.
Well, it has to be -- I think

15

it has to be a minimum that, but you know, it could be

MR. PHILLIPS:

Exactly.

That -- that's the

only point I was trying to make on that score.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Would your argument be any

7

different if there weren't a statutory obligation to

8

keep the government informed of the -- of one's mailing

9

address?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think I would still make the

11

same argument.

12

extraordinary force when the -- when the petitioner has

13

an obligation to provide us with notice because, again,

14

it goes -- you know, why is this reasonably calculated?

15

It's -- it's in the context of a scheme that says you

I just think the argument has

16

will provide us specific information and we will rely

17

upon that as the mechanism by which we inform you of

18

your obligations to us and that under those

19

circumstances and only those circumstances, do you

20

forfeit your property rights.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it seems to me

22

unrealistic to assume that the average citizen would

know that duty more clearly than he'd know the duty to

pay his taxes.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

would know that duty is because every -- every property

2

tax form has on it a change of address at the very

3

bottom of it that's perforated.

4

a tax form, you get a thing that says change your --

5

let me know if you've changed your address.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So every time you get

Is there a provision of

7

Arkansas law that if in fact they do track down the

8

property owner and he is at an address different from

9

the last address that he had given, that the expense of

10

tracking him down may be charged to him, along with the

11

delinquent taxes, penalties, and so on?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

The -- the statute talks about

13

costs, but the State has never interpreted that term to

14

mean just sort of the out-of-pocket -- those kinds of

15

inchoate costs, and they usually talk about very

16

specific costs like the cost of noticing publication

17

and other -- you know, other items that you can -- you

18

know, where you have a receipt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

4

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

5
6
7
8
9

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The notice that was provided in this case
satisfies the Mullane reasonably calculated test.
First, the State sent it by certified mail.

10

Certified mail -- actually in response to a question

11

that came up earlier, the form -- when certified mail

12

is -- is delivered and the recipient is not there, they

13

leave a form 3849.

14

I think it's probably available from any post office.

15

On the reverse side, it says, we will redeliver or your

16

agent can pick up your mail at the post office, and it

17

has a place for the person to check off a box saying to

18

redeliver and leaves instructions to leave this where

19

the postman can find it.

20
21

That form isn't in the record, but

JUSTICE BREYER:

have to be there to sign for it again.

22

MR. FELDMAN:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

Yes, but redeliver -- you

Right, but they -All right.

Well, then --

then the problem -MR. FELDMAN:

They do need a signature.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- I'm thinking -- what I'm

2

thinking is that where -- where you're trying to reach

3

a person, the means has to be reasonably calculated.

4

I'm simply saying a means today is not reasonably

5

calculated to reach the average person unless it gives

6

him the choice of getting it when he's not home.

7

right?

8
9

All

Now, there are two ways that could happen.
One, you could modify that form or, second, the simple

10

rule would be if it comes back undelivered, mail them a

11

letter.

12

MR. FELDMAN:

The Court -- I believe that

13

certified mail is -- is a more reliable method than

14

first class mail because it requires the mailperson,

15

the carrier, to get to -- get a signature at -- at --

16

he has to go from a particular person.

17

deliver it to the wrong place.

18

itself has means whereby the carrier has to keep track

19

of how many receipts he's supposed to have, whether

20

he's brought them back and so on.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. FELDMAN:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

He can't

Also, the post office

I didn't say all that.

And -I said do either.

What I --

24

what I was thinking of, which isn't clearly I think

25

coming across, is send it certified mail, by all means.

49
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Fine.

He either has to sign and say, leave it off

2

tomorrow, I'm not home, or if the post office doesn't

3

make that available, then if the letter comes back

4

undelivered, the person who's trying to send him notice

5

has to send him an ordinary letter.

6

MR. FELDMAN:

And if the Court were to adopt

7

that rule, it would give States an enormous incentive

8

and people giving notice to just send things by first

9

class mail in the first instance, which this Court has

10

repeatedly said and has -- has said is -- is sufficient

11

to satisfy due process, including in cases involving

12

tax sales in the Mennonite case, condemnation of

13

property in the -- in the City of New York case, and

14

similar kinds of events.

15

Certified -- what the State did here, though,

16

it has always -- it has generally been thought that

17

certified mail is a more reliable means of giving

18

people notice, and that's what the State used here.

19

And I don't -- I don't take petitioner to be arguing

20

that they made a mistake because they used certified

21

mail rather than First class mail.

22

Having said that, the State also sent the

23

mail to the only address, probably the only address

24

anywhere in the public record.

25

they've provided is that where the property owner is in

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, right, but the State

under the Dusenbery case is not obligated to provide

actual notice.

15

notice reasonably calculated to let the person know

16

what's going on, and if the person is not responding to

17

a notice from the Commissioner of State Lands and going

18

to the post office to pick it up or asking for it to be

19

redelivered, I don't think this Court has ever

20

suggested that in those circumstances, the notice is --

21

is inappropriate because the -- the landowner hasn't

22

taken the steps that he should have taken to -- to, in

address because it may well have had the correct

address and he didn't go to the post office to pick it

the right address, it has to take unspecified further

that doesn't work, presumably another address and

Yes, our position is that the

standard is if it was reasonably calculated to provide

that ties him to this property, and their belief that

saying, nobody is claiming this, would have done

something more.

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I don't think that that's

14

necessarily true.

15

what the -- whoever it was who had to provide the

notice in that case had to do was provide notice to the

17

addresses.

18

that it used.

notice came back unclaimed, then the State was entitled

to assume that either it had provided notice and he

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

think that every year, I'm confident that there's home

2

-- there's people throughout the country probably who

3

are notified of -- of tax sales and things like that

4

because someone sees it, someone lets them know.

5

They're keeping an eye on that to see what's happening

6

to their property.

He had left his property without

Now, notice by publication is not preferred,

10

but what -- the line that's drawn in Mullane and the

11

Court's other cases are where the address is very

12

easily ascertainable or readily available or at hand

13

versus where it's not.

14

to say, well, that line has to be -- it's going to

15

overrule cases that -- that have actually drawn that

16

line, such as Mullane itself that permitted publication

17

notice to some people, then I think the result follows

18

here that when the notice came back unclaimed, that was

19

-- the State was permitted to go ahead with the sale.

20

And unless the Court is going

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Mullane, as Mr.

21

Kirkpatrick pointed out, involved masses of people.

22

This was a common trust fund, and the reliance was on

23

that a goodly number of them would get notice and they

24

were kind of stand-ins for the ones who didn't.

here, we're dealing with a single individual.

of publication versus notice by mail at where the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why isn't -- why isn't the

simple answer to that concern to say, look, there's no

16

way to tell in advance or, you know, by any general

17

rule, at least not legislatively, how far they've got

18

to go to try to find the correct address, but they know

19

where the house is and they've got at that point to go

to the house and put a notice on the door?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL T. KIRKPATRICK

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19
20
21

MR. KIRKPATRICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
First, I'd just like to point out that it

22

absolutely is in the State's interest to provide the

23

best notice practicable for three reasons.

24
25

First, redemption of property by the owner is
the most efficient and cost effective means for the

58
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

State to collect the back taxes.

2

Second, the State has an interest in

3

protecting its citizens from a loss of assets in

4

equity, like what was lost by Mr. Jones here.

5

And third, if notice is received because of

6

follow-up efforts or if the State can show that it has

7

made follow-up efforts, then it will not face

8

challenges based on inadequate notice.

9

In terms of the feasibility of doing

10

something more, the question was raised about other

11

States.

12

about five or six States that actually have a statutory

13

scheme that deals with what happens when initial mailed

14

notice comes back.

15

of the reply brief, we indicate States that require

16

posting and States that require notice to occupants.

17

Certainly many States do more.

We've listed

And in footnote 9 and footnote 10

Justice Souter, with regard to your question

18

about the cost of tracking down a better address or

19

providing notice, those costs can be passed on to the

20

redeemer or purchaser of the property.

21

at the statute dealing with notice to homestead owners,

22

it says that where the mail does not work, the

23

additional cost of the notice by personal service of

24

process will be paid by the owner of the homestead who

25

redeems.

And if we look

for a better address just like we do in the Freedom of

3

Information Act context when we charge for Government

5

They could pass along the costs of searching

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

With -- with respect

6

to the fact that your client did not alert the State to

7

its change of address, is there anything in the record

8

about whether that his separation was permanent or is

9

that a gradual thing?

10
11

I mean, did he not know if this

was a permanent change of address or what?
MR. KIRKPATRICK:

There's nothing in the

12

record about that, Your Honor, but certainly when he

13

first moved out, he did not know what the future would

14

hold in terms of the length of that separation.

15

Now, it -- it is also not in the record, but

16

he did, in fact, file a change of address form, a

17

forwarding form, but it had long expired before these

18

certified letters came.

19

the part of the letter carrier not to say, forwarding
