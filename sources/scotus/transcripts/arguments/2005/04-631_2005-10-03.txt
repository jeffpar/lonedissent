ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

We will now hear

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

Kansas imposes a tax on the distributors of

11

motor fuel.

12

explicitly, by statute, imposed on the distributor of the

13

first receipt of the fuel.

14

collected off-reservation from non-Indians.

15

when, and where of the tax is all off-reservation and non-

16

Indian.

17

The legal incidence of that tax is

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The tax is, thus, imposed and

Mr. Olson, may I ask you to go

19

understand from reading the briefs?

20

quick quotations.

21

Let me give you three

First, the court of appeals opinion contains

22

this statement, "An expert on behalf of the tribe reported

23

that basic economic theory teaches that the nation's

24

station cannot charge prices high enough to allow

25

collection of both the Kansas and the nation's fuel

taxes."

2

The red brief says, on page 8, "It is undisputed

3

that enforcing the State tax on fuel sold and delivered to

4

the station would effectively nullify the tribal fuel

5

tax."

6

Finally, the yellow brief, on page 13, says, "By

7

selling its fuel at market prices, respondent" -- the

8

tribe -- "is making both a profit and collecting a tax."

9

My question is, Do we know, from the record,

10

whether the tax that is assessed on the distributor is, in

11

fact, passed through to the tribe so that, in economic

12

effect, the tribe is collecting, via pass-through, the

13

State tax and imposing its own tax and still selling at

14

market prices?

15

MR. OLSON:

I had -- I had the same question,

16

Justice Souter, as I was looking at this yesterday.

17

investigated it.

18

not find this completely in the record, that the

19

distributor is, indeed, paying the tax, and that the tribe

20

is also collecting a tax.

how you reconcile those two points that you've just

22

raised.

not possible, how can it -- how is it that it's being

24

done.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe they make it up on volume.

There is a differential between the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's only a

But I think the

But if -- if I may interrupt

10

you -- if it's getting passed through, and they're still

11

selling their gas, then there's no -- then the tribe

12

cannot make an argument here that their sovereign taxing

13

authority is being compromised or threatened.

14

argument, basically, would boil down to the argument that

15

they want to make a bigger profit.

16
17

MR. OLSON:

Well, I agree with that.

And the

And I also

would point out --

market a product without having to pay the burdens of

taxation all the way upstream.

prevails, then the distributor still sends the truck to

it that's -MR. OLSON:

It's my understanding -- and this is

3

explained -- the details of this are explained in Section

4

3410 -- I can't give you a citation to the record, but the

5

statutes, I'm presuming, are available -- that the

6

distributor pays a -- pays a tax as a result of taking the

7

fuel down from what they call the rack, and then taking it

8

to various service stations --

9
10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, what event triggers, if

you will, the incidence of the tax on the distributor?

11

MR. OLSON:

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It's -Is it -- is it the obligation

13

-- is it the minute the fuel is brought into Kansas?

14

it when it is delivered to the distributor?

15

MR. OLSON:

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

17

MR. OLSON:

Is

It's -Or is it later?

The statute explicitly says, Justice

18

O'Connor -- this is on page 2 of the petition -- the

19

incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor of the

20

first receipt of the motor fuel.

21

that's Section 3408(c) -- Section 3410 then describes, in

22

a little bit more detail, the physical operation of the

23

reports that the distributor has to make, and the

24

distributor has to pay the tax.

25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And then Section --

So, the distributor gets the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

fuel and incurs the obligation at that point, whether or

2

not it's resold.

MR. OLSON:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct.
But doesn't incur it, or gets

5

a credit or get it back, if it sells to the United States

6

or if it sells out-of-State.

7

just the receipt.

8
9

MR. OLSON:

In other words, it's not

It's -- Justice Ginsburg, it is the

receipt that triggers the liability for the tax.

There is

10

a -- an exemption that may be taken in connection with

11

sales to the United States, and that's a part of a massive

12

quid pro quo operation, where fuel is sold to the United

13

States, and the United States pays the State back

14

substantially all of the tax that --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

MR. OLSON:

And out-of-State or abroad --

And out-of-State, there is a

17

deduction for fuel sold out-of-State.

18

because the purpose for the tax is to pay for the roads in

19

Kansas, and it's --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's logical,

Then that's the problem, right

21

there, because I thought -- first, there is a tax -- you

22

get a credit if you don't sell the fuel to anybody.

23

don't think it's quite -- if you just sit there with --

MR. OLSON:

You are Kansas.

You sell --

23

the retailer in Kansas sells it to Nebraska.

Nebraska is,

24

in a sense, a foreign and independent State.

And I guess,

25

at some level, the tribes are arguing, "Well, you sell to

We, too, are a foreign and

Well -Now, what -- now you have the

whole argument that I'm thinking of.
MR. OLSON:

What do you respond?

Well, one of my responses is that

16

the tribe is located entirely within the State.

17

record is clear that most of the fuel purchased at that

18

station is used on highways paid for by Kansas.

19

overwhelming majority of the fuel is not used on a

20

reservation road; its used on the highways of the State of

21

Kansas to get to the casino or to leave the casino.

22

road that's at issue in this case is 1.5 miles long.

23

rest of the driving, according to the record, is on the

24

highways of Kansas.

25

So, there's a clear difference there.

When you sell -- when the distributors market

fuel in Nebraska -JUSTICE STEVENS:

But, Mr. Olson, would it make

3

any difference if all of the driving was inside the

4

reservation?

Would it --

5

MR. OLSON:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7

MR. OLSON:

No, we would --- make any difference?

-- we would argue that it would not

8

make any difference, Justice Stevens, because this is a

9

tax on distributors.

It is -- the Legislature of Kansas

10

followed the specific advice of this Court in its

11

unanimous opinion in the Chickasaw Nation that if there is

12

an issue with respect to the tax being imposed on --

13

arguably burdening the tribe, the State can change the

14

legal incidence of the tax.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's a -Well, that -- that has been

16

what's discussed in the brief, and I think that the court,

17

in Chickasaw, was saying, If the State puts the incidence

18

on the tribe itself, we don't have to look any further.

19

That's what it said.

20

on the tribe or members inside the reservation, no

21

balancing.

22

rests on non-Indians, as here, with the distributor here,

23

then there is no categorical bar, than balancing kicks in.

24

So, all Chickasaw dealt with, with the categorical rule,

25

is when the State says the incidence of the tax is on the

When the State levies a tax directly

But then it also said that if the incidence

MR. OLSON:

I -- that's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.

reservation tax on non-Indians.

5

there's no balancing necessary in this case unless you're

6

going to involve an -- require States to submit to

7

litigation and engage in balancing every time an off-

reservation tax on non-Indians has some downstream

9

economic effect.

But the answer is that this is an entirely offWe're -- we submit that

But what about the tax on the car that

10

brings the casino patron to the reservation?

11

the tax on the cigarettes or the alcohol or the gambling

12

machinery?

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about

Well, Mr. Olson, the

14

Solicitor General tells us that -- and here we have -- you

15

have the statute, but they have the Kaul case that

16

suggests that this tax is imposed on the reservation.

17

MR. OLSON:

But the Kaul case, in the context of

18

deciding whether other retailers there had standing,

19

basically said that there was an economic impact that

20

affected the retailers.

21

referred, Mr. Chief Justice, to the fact that the

22

legislature had -- and this is on page 67 of the Pacific

23

2nd cite of the Kaul opinion -- the legislature amended

24

the statute -- this is at the bottom of the second column

25

-- or the first column -- to clarify the question where

The Kaul case specifically

the incidence of taxation falls.

2

that, unless otherwise specified, the incidence of the tax

3

falls on the distributor.

4

court went on to evaluate the standing question and

5

allowed the distributors the -- to raise the issue,

6

because the economic burden did come through the

7

distributors.

8
9

The legislature provided

Then, Mr. Chief Justice, the

It's important, in that context, to note that
the ultimate burden of any of these taxes is not falling

10

on the retailer, it's falling on the consumer.

11

falling on the consumer of the gasoline.

12

puts the gasoline in the car, and then the car is driven

13

overwhelmingly -- the facts are unquestionable in this

14

case -- overwhelmingly on the highways of the State of

15

Kansas.

It's

The consumer

So that the burden -- ultimately, the burden --

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but, again, that would

17

still be true if the incidence -- the tax was on the

18

retailer rather than the wholesaler.

19

MR. OLSON:

It still would be true.

And -- but

20

the fact is, in this case you have a -- off-reservation

21

tax, on the -- all distributors --

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Which the statute contemplates

23

will be collected when the gas is sold to the -- by the

24

retailer.

25

MR. OLSON:

It -- what the statute specifically

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

says -- this is Section 3409 -- it says that the

2

distributor may pass on -- "may" -- it's a permissive

3

provision -- may pass on the cost of the taxation as a

4

part of the cost of doing business.

5

distributor does that with respect to the cost of its

6

vehicles, the cost of other taxes it pays.

7

those provisions.

8

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But what a strange provision.
Why did

-MR. OLSON:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

It may include

I mean, who would have thought that he couldn't?

And, of course, the

in, unless it means something different from -MR. OLSON:

understand, Justice Scalia, and I -- because I've had the

16

same reaction, "Well, of course he could.

18

business."

19

to make clear one of the factors that distinguishes this

20

case from the Chickasaw Nation case, where the court found

21

that it was significant that the distributor was required

22

to pass on the tax, act as a collection agent for the

23

retailer, and took a 1.5 percent commission.

24

court thought that might be significant.

25

I think, want to make -- wanted to make it very clear that

Why does he

the -- what was happening in the economic chain is cost of

2

production of gasoline, including tax paid by the

3

distributor, could be passed on in the form of cost of

4

business to the retailer.

5
6
7

Now, of course its cost -- it passed on, also,
to the consumer.

The question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Olson, what does it

8

mean when they say, in law, the "incidence of the taxes on

9

the distributor"?

10

he has to pay it?

11

Does that mean anything other than that

MR. OLSON:

It is unclear from this court's

12

decisions precisely what "legal incidence" means.

13

least it was unclear to me as I was looking through the

14

court's decisions.

15

liability for the tax, the responsibility to pay the tax,

16

the fact that -- in this case, the retailer has no

17

liability for the tax.

18

on the distributor.

19

of Kansas and the distributor.

20

together make it clear to me, from this court's previous

21

decisions, that "legal incidence" is a term of art,

22

especially in the field of taxation.

23

pointed out in the Chickasaw Nation case, it's important

24

to have a --

25

At

But I think it's a combination of the

The only liability for the tax is

The relationship is between the State

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And all of those factors

And, as the court

Well, I guess the reason

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

for my question is, they look back at the court's

2

decisions and see that it turns on where the incidence of

3

the tax is.

4

who said, "All we have to do is pass a law saying the

5

incidence is -- of the tax is on the distributor, and

6

we're going to win."

7

MR. OLSON:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10

And so, there's some bright lawyer in Kansas

Well -So, it suggests that we

shouldn't give too much weight to that.
MR. OLSON:

Well, the bright lawyer in Kansas

11

who may have done that was the Kansas Legislature,

12

following the unanimous decision of this court in

13

Chickasaw Nation, saying, "If you want to avoid the

14

potential problems that would exist, change" -- and it's

15

not just the incidence of the tax, it's the legal

16

incidence of the tax, it's -- of course, the economic

17

burden of taxation is spread out throughout the chain of

18

distribution.

19

this court's opinions, are -- is, it is exactly what it is

20

here, the distributor must pay for the tax, the

21

distributor must account for the tax, the distributor is

22

liable and may be penalized if the tax is not paid.

23

Nobody else is liable for it.

24

the tax even if it doesn't sell the gasoline.

25

The legal incidence of the tax, as I read

The distributor has to pay

Here, not only the language is as clear as it

could be -- I mean, the legislature specifically says it

-- but the operation of the statute -- and the two -- the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Olson, in terms of the

2

text of the statute that is -- the incidence is on the

3

distributor of the first receipt, but then there's this

4

language -- and it appears in a few places -- "the tax is

5

hereby imposed on the use, sale, or delivery."

6

-- what does that mean, that the tax is imposed on the

7

use, sale, or delivery?"

8
9

MR. OLSON:

What does

Well, this is -- this is an effort

by the legislature to say that fuel, which is going to be

10

used in Kansas, by and large -- there's always going to be

11

exceptions -- fuel that is used, by and large, in Kansas

12

on the roads of Kansas, shall be subject to a tax so that

13

those roads can be built and maintained.

14

we, mechanically, impose and collect that tax?

15

it on the first receipt by the distributor.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Now, how shall

Does that mean, Mr. Olson,

17

that the tax that the -- the fuel, rather, that's sold to

18

the United States Government, later, out-of-State, when is

19

the credit for the sales out-of-State made?

at the time of the initial delivery, or is -- do they ask

21

for a refund a month later?

It seems to me that might be a

way of identifying whether the term "legal incidence"

really has any significance.

MR. OLSON:

Well, I would say that the -- that

5

if the -- this Court's prior decisions have any consistent

6

meaning, that the person who has the obligation to pay the

7

tax, and who might claim some credits or deductions, like

8

we all do when we file our tax returns, the legal

incidence of the tax is on us, as taxpayers.

10

here is the distributor.

happen to it, or does he have to pay the tax, or accept

the obligation to pay the tax, and then --

-- the statute says it's

first sale, and the first sale is to the distributor, and

that's why the incidence of the tax is on him.

With respect, Your Honor, what

practice, Your Honor, is -- and their form is in the back

of the red brief -- is that the distributor writes down

the number of gallons received, and writes down the number

of gallons sold to the United States, nets that out, and

pays the tax on the net, so that it's -- it's essentially

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- the Constitution and the Federal preemption doctrine

2

prohibit discrimination.

But it also goes to the strength of the State interest

4

here.

5

of-State interest, it has also accommodated the in-State

6

Government interests, other than the tribe.

7

to 40 percent of the fuel revenues to counties and to

8

cities for roads.

9

here except for the tribe, and we think that's exactly

10

what Federal law prohibits and why the strength of the

11

tribal interest here, and the tribe's interest in imposing

12

the tax to fix reservation roads, to advance that Federal

13

interest, is exactly what deserves protection.

And so, it is, in that sense.

concludes that the incidence of the tax is on the
