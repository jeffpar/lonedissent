ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD S. ZAS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ZAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Speedy Trial Act protects the public, as

11

well as the personal interests of defendants, by

12

mandating the prompt disposition of Federal criminal

13

prosecutions.

14

district court failed to comply with the clear

15

requirements of the act.

In this case, the Government and the

16

As relevant here, the act provides that the

trial of a defendant who pleads not guilty and who is

18

released on bail shall commence within 70 days after

The act, however, is not as inflexible

mechanism.

1

This case concerns two periods of delay, that

2

each exceed the 70-day time limit, and I'd like to

3

focus initially on the longer period of delay.

4

This is the delay that took place between

5

2000 and 2001, after a competency proceeding was taken

6

under advisement.

7

competency hearing was held on July 10, 2000.

8

judge solicited post-hearing briefs.

9

taken under advisement on August 23rd, and in our

Just to put this delay in context, a

papers, we asked the judge to find Petitioner competent

11

and to set the matter for trial as soon as possible.

12

We noted that at that point the case was already more

13

than 4 years old.

14

proceed to a bench trial immediately.

15

We offered to waive a jury and

17

days of that period.

18

reasons that have never been explained, the court sat

19

on the proceeding.

Now, the act excludes only the first 30
That's section 3161(h)(1)(J).

20

When 7 months went by, we filed a motion.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

For

What about, Mr. Zas, that

22

the court thought it was home free on the Speedy Trial

23

Act?

24

Isn't that why the 165 days?

25

MR. ZAS:

After all, it had gotten a waiver for all time.

That may be, Justice Ginsburg, but

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- but as of our filing after the competency

2

proceeding, we asked for a trial as soon as possible.

3

So putting aside whether the waiver had any validity at

4

all, which I'll get to shortly, the waiver had no

5

effect when we came in and asked for a trial.

6

Otherwise, defendants would have no right to a speedy

7

trial and --

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but on -- on that one,

9

the -- the Second Circuit said that he was incompetent,

10

and you could have excluded the time on (4) because (4)

11

allows you to exclude time when he's incompetent.

12

if, in fact, the district judge is sitting there

13

thinking he's incompetent, then the failure is simply a

14

failure to write down his reason why it's excluded.

15

guess there's uncertainty here as to what reason

16

was the district judge excluded that time, and it's a

17

little bit hypothetical for the reason that Justice

18

Ginsburg mentioned.

19

And

I

But if you were to lose on the first point,

20

then I guess on this point, the thing to do would be to

21

send it back and determine whether, in fact, the judge

22

intended to exclude on the ground of competency, in

23

which case his failure was simply a failure to note

24

down his reason, which is not required by the act.

25

MR. ZAS:

Well, Justice Breyer, I have

several responses for that.
The court only made a finding that Mr. Zedner

3

was incompetent on March 21, 2001.

4

the competency issue was under advisement.

5

be that Mr. Zedner's incompetency, if it existed before

6

the finding, is what prevented the court from declaring

7

him incompetent.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Prior to that time,
It couldn't

You're not quite through

your answer yet, but is there also a requirement that

10

the competency determination be made within 30 days?

11

Or am I -- am I in error on that point?

12
13
14
15

MR. ZAS:

Your Honor is -- is exactly right.

Any proceeding under section 3161(h)(1)(J) is excluded
but only for 30 days once it's taken under advisement.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm sorry.

My act must read

16

differently.

17

resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally

18

incompetent.

19

My act says in (4), any period of delay

It doesn't say anything about 30 days.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that -- but that's

20

different, I take it, from the judge's delay in making

21

the finding of competency.

22

MR. ZAS:

23

On -- Justice Breyer, on your reading, a -- a

That's right, Your Honor.

Yes.

24

court could sit indefinitely with the competency

25

proceeding under advisement.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, that's why, see, I

2

guess on this point, we'd have to send it back because

3

if, in fact, the judge had determined in his mind

4

within the 30-day period that the person was incompetent

5

or he was incompetent in fact, then that could have been

6

his reason.

7

I'm not sure what to do about this point in

8

any case, and I understand that you think he wasn't

9

incompetent, or at least it hadn't been so found.

10

Second Circuit seemed to think he was incompetent

11

because that was their basis.

12

it's excluded, and if he wasn't, it isn't excluded.

13

And I don't know.

14

maybe you should have another chance to argue this

15

before the Second Circuit.

16

MR. ZAS:

the Second Circuit and then go back to the district

erroneous. There is no -- there is no basis --

MR. ZAS:

That's right, Your Honor, and the

act --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which is what is

6

specifically precluded by the requirement that -- that

7

you act within 30 days, and -- and all the rest of the

8

time, the clock is running.

9

MR. ZAS:

10

That's correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I take it the trial --

11

the Speedy Trial Act doesn't say if the judge is

12

thinking about something, it requires him to make an

13

order.

14

MR. ZAS:

No, Your Honor.

It -- it says that

15

the court has decide the matter within 30 days or the

16

clock will start running.

17

Now, the court, in a particularly difficult

18

or novel question, could -- could enter an order of

19

ends of justice exclusion and exclude perhaps an

20

additional period of time.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I was going to ask

22

you about that.

he wants new evidence or something?

And that

matter would -- would be back to a -- a situation in

which there's examinations or hearings or argument or

long as the judge wants there.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So your view is that we

should say that the Second Circuit's statement that the

10

defendant could not have been tried because, at that

11

time, he was incompetent, that we should simply say

12

that's false, that the Second Circuit is wrong to say

13

that.

14

MR. ZAS:

Well, not quite, Your Honor.

The

15

question -- the question is did more than 70

That's

Now, the Government has abandoned the Second

Circuit's holding to the effect that harmless error

7

analysis applies to a violation of the 70-day limit.

8

That's a wise position for the Government take -- to

9

take, given this Court's holding in Bozeman which

10

interpreted essentially the same language.

11

there held that where the statute says the indictment

12

shall be dismissed, there's no room for harmless error

13

analysis.

14

in this case on the -- on the -- this period of delay

15

we're talking about, more than 70 days elapsed, and the

16

remedy must be dismissal.

That's the remedy that Congress chose.

It's not

harmless because the statute says that if the defendant

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but isn't -- isn't the

16

difference that in the latter period, the court took no

With respect to this earlier period, the court did act.

MR. ZAS:

Justice Souter, I would -- I would

not characterize this as a clerical error.

7

considered this provision the heart of -- of a scheme.

8

Congress

This was where --

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, let's put it this way.

10

It's a failure to speak rather than a failure to act.

11

In -- in the latter case, no action.

In this case,

12

action, in fact, action as more -- it's as requested.

13

But a failure to speak contemporaneously with the

14

action, that's different.

15
16
17

MR. ZAS:

Well, I would disagree, again with

the characterization that it's just a failure to speak.

MR. ZAS:

And that's -- that

Well, Your Honor, I think that the

7

principle -- well-accepted principle that the more

8

specific provision will govern over the general governs

here.

So the remedy provision, the sanctions provision

10

here says that the indictment shall be dismissed

11

whether it's 71 days that elapsed or 200 days or 5

12

years.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But there's always some

14

sanction for error, and the point of the harmless error

15

rule is to determine whether that specific sanction

16

should be applied.

Yes, but there's not always a -- an

express command from Congress as to what the remedy

Mr. Zas, are you going to

talk about estoppel?

Yes, Your Honor.

There are several problems with the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

3

defendant said, okay, I waive.

there's -- there's an affirmative act on the part of

the defendant.

7

court, and subject I guess to cutting down the period

somewhat, he got what he asked for.

I mean, it would cover a situation, for

specific relief requested by him, and he now wants to

That's more than waiver.
MR. ZAS:

with what you've said, but -- but the --

a perpetual waiver?

MR. ZAS:

How is it not correct?

Well, it's not correct because I

would -- I would disagree with the characterization, if

that's what Your Honor is doing, of -- of anything that

happened here as being sandbagging.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not talking about here.

would think, in the most egregious cases.

that is what the statute says.

2

shouldn't -- shouldn't tarry too long about the

3

consequences because if this Court holds, as we ask the

4

Court to hold, that waivers are no good -- waivers have

5

to be treated essentially as a request for a

6

continuance -- this problem goes away.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But Your Honor

Maybe.

I mean, judges are

8

very busy.

very hard to ask district judges to raise something on

Not all the prosecutors get the word.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This -- this was a judge

MR. ZAS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19
20
21

MR. JOSEFFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On the first of the time periods, it might

22

help if I could start by laying out three basic

23

principles.

24
25

The first is that a defendant may not opt out
of the act by waiver.

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

The second is that a -- a defendant is,

2

nonetheless, precluded from challenging the grant of a

3

continuance that he requested if the continuance

4

satisfies the substantive ends of justice standards of

5

the act and the defendant's waiver or other litigation

6

conduct induced the court to commit the procedural

7

error of not recording an ends of justice finding in

8

the record.

9

And the third related point, although it's

10

not presented here, is that the courts of appeals have

11

recognized that if a defendant requests an ends of

12

justice continuance and the court in a procedurally

13

regular manner grants the ends of justice continuance,

14

the defendant cannot later be heard to contend that

15

there was -- the ends of justice were not really

16

satisfied even though he had told the court that they

17

were.

18

We think the reasons for those three rules

19

stems from the reason that defendants cannot opt out of

20

the act in the first place.

21

contain an express anti-waiver or anti-estoppel

22

provision, it does manifest an intent to bind

23

defendants to its requirements in order to protect the

24

public interest in a speedy trial.

25

could opt out of the act altogether and thereby obtain

Although the act does not

If a defendant

26
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

delays that are not authorized by the act, that would

2

thwart the public interest in a speedy trial.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but as we've

4

indicated, the -- the judge was the one that opted out

5

of the act by this regular practice of requiring the

6

perpetual waiver, or whatever we call it.

7

MR. JOSEFFER:

I guess there -- there are

8

couple things there.

9

we are not here relying on the waiver for all time.

One is that we are not -- we --

10

Our point, instead, here is that when defendant

11

requested the continuance at issue here, it was the

12

defendant that said, Your Honor, I -- I need a

13

continuance and I waive my rights so you should give me

14

the continuance and then also said he needed additional

15

preparation time.

16

The court then -- and this -- this is at J.A.

17

from about page 81 to 85.

The court then said, well,

18

why do you need the time?

And the court discussed with

19

him for a while why he really needed additional

20

preparation time, reminded counsel that,

21

notwithstanding the waiver, this was a criminal case

22

and criminal cases do need to be tried, and ended up

23

balancing the defendant's desire for preparation

24

against the need for a speedy trial by granting a much

25

shorter continuance than requested.

And that is

27
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

actually an entirely appropriate ends of justice

2

balancing, ends of justice reasoning.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's pretty hard to read

4

those pages as if they were anything other than what

5

they seemed to be on their face, that he didn't worry

6

about the Speedy Trial Act because he thought that it

7

had been waived.

8
9
10

MR. JOSEFFER:

I think you're absolutely

right that the court was not, at that point, thinking
in terms of applying the Speedy Trial Act.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, then why isn't that

12

the end of that, that the -- if you agree that the

13

defendant can't waive it, well, the reason that he got

14

the continuance is because he waived it, otherwise

15

there would have been something else done and -- or at

16

least might have been.

17

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

No.

Our -- I mean, we

18

think there are two related points.

19

genuine opt-out of the waiver and a general opt-out of

20

the act, an attempt to obtain time that's not

21

excludable under the act is not permissible because

22

that would thwart the public interest in a speedy

23

trial.

24
25

One is that a

But where the error is a purely procedural
one, a failing to record findings in the record

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

regarding a continuance that is permitted under the

2

substantive standards of the act, then holding the

3

defendant to the waiver, under a theory of either

4

waiver or estoppel -- in our view doesn't matter

5

which --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How can we say it's purely

7

procedural with respect to the first time?

8

reason that was given is I have to -- I need this time

9

to find out if these really peculiar looking bonds are

10
11

I mean, the

genuine.
Now, the -- the Second Circuit said -- and I

12

don't understand why they said this -- this is a

13

complex case so that continuance is warranted.

14

this a complex case?

15
16

MR. JOSEFFER:

(Laughter.)

18

MR. JOSEFFER:

20

Complex defendants can make

for complex cases.

17

19

Was

And this is, I think, the

ultimate example of that.
But in addition, it's important to remember

21

that at the end of this 90-day period that was granted,

22

defense counsel withdrew on the ground that his client

23

was still insisting that he present the frivolous

24

defense that -- that the bonds were genuine.

25

before withdrawing and telling the court that, the --

And

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the defense counsel had a very serious duty to his

2

client and the court to continue to investigate what

3

his client was saying was the defense and to continue

4

to try to work with his client and try to come up with

5

a plausible defense strategy.

6

counsel had to withdraw, but I don't think he can be

7

faulted for trying.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, it didn't work and

Did the Government at any

9

point tell the -- tell the court, Your Honor, we think

10

the act requires you to make a specific finding and we

11

request you do that?

12

MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

The Government -- I mean,

13

on the one hand, the Government did not seek these

14

delays, did not encourage the waiver, did not rely on

15

the waiver at the -- at the relevant times.

16

at the time -- I mean --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

However,

Because, I mean, you're --

18

you're coming in and saying, oh, well, he waived, but

19

certainly the Government could -- could have asked the

20

-- asked the district court to make the necessary

21

findings.

22

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right, and at the time of --

23

of this -- this was about 10 years ago now -- the

24

Second Circuit recently held that waiver is not

25

ordinarily appropriate, but sometimes is.

And so

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

everyone in the bar, I mean, has been acting under some

2

-- some confusion, we think, that -- that frankly, to

3

some extent, persists to this day.

4

We think that the best way to clarify matters

5

going forward is -- is a combination of the two things

6

I mentioned earlier, to say, first, defendants cannot

7

opt out of the act by waiver, to just try to discourage

8

waivers.

9

when a -- a continuance -- when a court grants a

But to say that mistakes will happen and that

10

specific continuance that is authorized under the

11

substantive standards of the act, that at that point in

12

time, the defendant's waiver or other conduct that

13

induces a court not to make the findings prevents the

14

defendant from trying to seize on a purely procedural

15

violation on appeal because at that point -- remember,

16

the -- the reason for -- for a -- a partial anti-waiver

17

rule here is not that there's a specific anti-waiver or

18

anti-estoppel provision in the act.

19

has, on the whole, manifested an intent to protect the

20

public interest in a speedy trial.

21

excludable under the substantive standards of the act,

22

a purely procedural error does not diminish the

23

public's interest in a speedy trial because the --

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:
hypothesizing?

6

speaking, all that matters is that the court could

have, and that once --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So --

so we're going to -- why can't life be simple?

We're

going to have to have trials all the time as to

could have been made.

In -- in some instances, it

15

may add to an additional degree of complexity, although

16

I'll say that whatever that might be, it's still less

17

than the complexity of retrying the case.

19

I mean, these -- these determinations can be made.

basic reasoning for doing so.

15

You're

MR. JOSEFFER:

We're saying he's right
I'm having

Well, anytime you're talking

16

about a waiver or estoppel theory, the premise is that

17

there -- there may well have been underlying error, and

18

the question is whether the defendant is precluded.

19

And here, there's no question there was an underlying

20

error because the findings were not required -- were

21

not reported in the act.

22

But the act does -- again, does not contain

23

an express anti-waiver provision, and the speedy trial

24

interests, which are the reason for reading, to some

25

extent, an anti-waiver provision, are -- are not

2

the time from the act.

3

interests would be harmed in that manner for three

4

reasons.

5

And to the contrary, speedy trial

First, it gives defendants every reason to

6

delay in hopes of manufacturing a speedy trial

7

violation.

8
9

Second, waiver and estoppel are generally
important to the efficient and orderly conduct of

10

litigation, and if you take those -- that out, what you

11

will get is less efficient litigation and more delays,

12

which Congress recognized when, as part of the Speedy

13

Trial Act, it required the courts to develop management

14

plans for the efficient handling of cases.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, you know, Congress

16

could have -- could have written it the way -- the way

17

you're proposing it.

know, when there -- when -- when there is good cause

19

for the continuance, the clock won't run.

20

say that.

It -- it said the judge has to make a

21

finding.

I mean, don't we have to give that some

22

effect?

23

Congress could have said, you

It didn't

You're saying it really doesn't matter

whether he makes the finding or not.

2

that will be enough.
MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

Our -- our view is that,

3

I mean, like anytime the waiver or estoppel is at

4

issue, one could say that that's being read into the

5

statute, but the point, as this Court has explained in

6

Hillen and -- and Mezzanatto, is that those are

7

background principles of law that presumptively apply.

8

Our view is this: a court should make the

9

finding, but a -- a defendant may not challenge the

10

finding if a few conditions are satisfied.

defendant was the one requesting the continuance and

12

benefiting from it.

14

defendant is responsible in some way for inducing the

court not to make the finding.

Well, it seems to me the

But let me ask you this.

Probably you can

respond to that as well if you like.

problems with reindicting -- I mean, how -- how is the

it's costly to the system, et cetera.

MR. JOSEFFER:

What are the

But is there

Well, I mean, there are two

concerns.

having to do a brand new jury trial after you've

13

already done a fair one.

14

in this case, the trial was 3 years ago.

15

One is, as you said, the -- the cost of

The second is that -- I mean,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course, I'm -- I'm

16

supposing that after this rule, there would be no trial

because there would be -- if -- if you don't prevail,

18

there wouldn't be a trial.

19

MR. JOSEFFER:

Oh, I -- well, if dismissal

20

was required in this case, I think dismissal would be

21

without prejudice as opposed to with prejudice and

therefore --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

are there severe costs with that when there's been no

The case is dismissed.

I'm hypothesizing that

Right.

I understand.

How costly is that to the

system other than getting the grand jury together?
MR. JOSEFFER:

Sorry.

I understand.

Yes, if

the Government ordinarily could reindict for -- if the

1

2

ordinarily could reindict very quickly, and the cost to

3

the system would not be great.

4

The real cost to the system comes in when the

5

district court does not dismiss and holds the trial

because then the trial has been held and then by the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

statute of limitations problem in -- in these cases if

MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

There's a -- the Judicial

19

Code contains a -- a provision that generally contains

20

a 6-month grace period for limitations following

dismissal by a court.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- the -- the

2

argument you're making is really one of invited error,

3

and I'm not sure it even applies on these facts.

4

mean, the -- the defense lawyer didn't, as you

5

hypothesized in one of your answers, say something to

6

the effect of don't worry, you don't need to make any

7

findings of the ends of justice or anything like that.

8

He just said I'm waiving my speedy trial rights, and

9

I

that may mean he's not gong to argue, you know, that

10

the ends of justice don't justify it or whatever.

11

just saying I don't have any objection.

12

assumed that the judge would go on and say, okay, I'm

13

making the findings required by subsection 8(a).

14

MR. JOSEFFER:

He's

Maybe he

Well, I think that when a --

15

when a litigant expressly waives his rights under an

16

act, that the very natural effect of that is to make

17

the court think he does not have to follow that act and

18

that would include the findings requirement.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, in this case, the

20

judge told the defendant I've got a solution to this.

21

Here's my form.

22

MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

It was the -- I mean, in

23

context, there were two -- at the earlier status

24

conference that does not relate to this hearing, but at

25

the earlier status, it was defendant who said, Your

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Honor, I want a continuance and I want to waive my

2

rights.

3

waiver, the court said, well, if you're going to waive,

4

you have to waive for all time, because the court was

5

concerned the defendant would selectively waive until

6

it was inconvenient for the court to try the case.

7

don't defend the court's response to that, but the

8

point is that even then it was the defendant who raised

9

waiver first.

10

In response to defendant's invocation of a

We

And then at this status conference regarding

11

this particular continuance, it was -- defendant was

12

the only one talking about waiver.

13

defendant initially raised it and said I -- I waive my

14

rights, then came back to it again.

15

just give me the continuance.

16

mean, the court did say that, well, if you've already

17

waived, you don't have to again.

18

that, notwithstanding the waiver, he couldn't give the

19

defendant an open-ended amount of time because this is

20

a criminal trial.

21

was pressing this at all times.

22

Defendant said --

I waive my rights,

And the court said -- I

But he then said

So it was defendant who was -- who

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you have any idea how

often this -- this sort of situation comes up where

there's an alleged violation of the act and then a

1

dismiss?

2

MR. JOSEFFER:

I think that happens with some

3

regularity.

4

case law in which defendants are protesting speedy

5

trial violations.

6

There's quite a lot of court of appeals

I mean, actually quite a lot.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You -- you made an argument

7

a moment ago which included the point that he asked for

8

this particular relief and represented what he needed

9

to do if he got the relief, the continuance.

You --

10

you came right up within a step of -- of making a

11

judicial estoppel claim, although you did not use those

12

terms.

13

I have two questions.
Did the Government raise at least the -- the

14

theory of judicial estoppel in the litigation before it

15

reached this point?

16

And the second question is, even if the

17

Government did not raise that term, asked for -- for

18

estoppel to be applied in those terms, did the

19

Government make the same argument that you have just

20

made which emphasizes the fact that he asked for it and

21

he represented the reasons for -- for needing it?

22

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.

In the -- in the court

23

of -- the answer your first question, in the court of

24

appeals -- we referred to our argument as one of waiver

25

rather than estoppel, in part because that's what the

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Second Circuit had in -- in the past referred to it as

2

being.

3

raised -- I mean, we were raising a similar waiver

4

argument below as the one that we are now.

And yes, in substance, we were -- we -- we

5

We don't think it matters greatly whether one

6

calls it waiver or estoppel, except that we do think

7

that estoppel is the -- is the -- the preferable way of

8

looking at because we're -- as -- as has been pointed

9

out, we're talking here not just about a waiver, but

10

also about a situation where a defendant requests

11

relief --

12
13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

The difference between

acquiescence and -- and potentially sandbagging.

14

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.

I mean, here the -- the

15

defendant is affirmatively requesting relief on the

16

basis of one -- one position and is now seeking

17

dismissal based on the fact that his first position was

18

accepted and received that relief.

19

situation in which judicial estoppel is -- is, frankly,

20

tailor-made for, and I think the fact that judicial

21

estoppel prevents that very situation helps to

22

underscore the -- that if -- if Congress really wanted

23

to --

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's a

Except -- except where

there's a public policy against what you want to estop

him into doing.

2

reason that you don't allow a waiver, you shouldn't

3

allow an estoppel.

4

I mean, it seems to me for the same

There's a public policy against it.

The -- the Congress wanted these things tried

5

promptly, and -- and whether he merely waives or -- or

6

goes further and affirmatively causes the court to do

7

something which it shouldn't have done, you're just as

8

much violating the policy it seems to me.

9

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, I think the -- I mean, I

10

-- I agree that -- I mean, whether it's waiver or it's

11

estoppel, if Congress manifests an affirmative intent

12

to displace those doctrines, they don't apply.

13

doesn't matter which -- which one you're under.

14

And it

But the -- the affirmative intent that

15

Congress manifested here, notwithstanding -- I mean,

16

remember, there's no express anti-waiver or anti-

17

estoppel provision, but the affirmative intent is to

18

protect the public's interest in a speedy trial.

19

that -- that intent is entirely protected when a delay

20

could be -- is permitted by the substantive standards

21

of the act, and the only error is a procedural one that

22

the defendant helped to induce the court to commit.

23

And I mentioned -- in that circumstance, there's not

24

only no delay that was not contemplated by Congress.

25

And

But as I mentioned before there are three

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reasons that permitting a defendant to seek dismissal

2

in that circumstance would actually harm speedy trial

3

rights.

First, the incentive for defendants to delay.

4

Second, the inefficiency, and the third is that,

5

remember, one of the main reasons, if not the main

6

reason, that Congress wanted speedy trials was that it

7

was concerned that defendants out on bail were

8

committing crimes.

9

prevention is not served in the least by letting a

And Congress' concern with crime

10

defendant seek dismissal of an indictment based on a

11

purely procedural error that he helped to cause.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If -- if what you say is

13

true, I don't know why it makes any difference that the

14

defendant led the court into it.

15

believe that this is just a procedural nicety that was

16

not complied with, why shouldn't you do the same thing

17

when -- when the court fails to make the finding but

18

could have made the finding whether or not the

19

defendant was the one that led him into it?

20

MR. JOSEFFER:

If you -- if you

Well, the question then would

21

be harmless error analysis.

made.

25

I mean, we agree the

Therefore, there was an error.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Washington, DC 20005

1

he -- the evidence of guilt was substantial?

2

how does the harmless error work?

3

MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

What --

If -- if one moved beyond

4

the inducement and into harmless error, the question

5

would be -- would be that there here the -- the error

6

-- I think as I mentioned before, the error here would

7

be the failure -- would -- would be the clerical one,

8

the error to record findings in the act.

9

And I think -- and we would agree that the

10

act -- pointing to the second question now.

11

act does expressly say that if a defendant is not tried

12

within 70 relevant days, the indictment shall be

13

dismissed.

14

analysis would not be appropriate to the question

15

whether 71 or 81 days of delay is appropriate because

16

Congress said 70 is 70.

17

But the

And that suggests that harmless error

But when the error is not that, but the error

18

is failing to record something in the record, that's a

19

distinct type of error that's not covered by the

20

mandatory dismissal provision.

21

harmless, especially in circumstances where the record

22

reflects --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it could be considered

Why do you -- why do

24

you put that in a separate category?

25

unusual for Congress to put that type of a requirement

in the statute.

they normally would write it.

interest of justice.

the record of the case.

7

8

sort of a second-class status.

9

They could have normally -- I suspect
You know, you -- you --

But they went further and they

I mean, they set it forth as a
I don't know that we can give it

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, I -- I agree that --

10

that section (h)(8) is different from the incompetency

11

exclusion, for example, which I'll turn to in a minute,

12

in that it does tie the -- the findings to the

13

excludability. And that makes the -- the harmless error

14

argument that we have on that issue, obviously, more

15

difficult than on the -- the incompetency issue.

16

But it's still -- I think it ultimately comes

17

down to how you -- how you view the error.

18

error not trying someone within 70 days, or is the

19

error not recording a finding in the record?

20

if you focus on -- on the findings aspect --

21
22
23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is the

And if --

Or say the error is

not complying with the act.
MR. JOSEFFER:

Right, and then -- but the --

24

but the -- I mean, ordinarily that -- just not

25

complying with the act generally is harmless, and the

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

question would be is -- is that -- because, remember,

2

the -- the only thing that's subject to mandatory

3

dismissal is not trying someone within 70 relevant

4

days.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, within 70 relevant days

6

counted as the statute requires them to be counted,

7

which includes the requirement of this finding set

8

forth in the record before you can stop the clock

9

running for -- you know, for some period.

I don't

10

think that that's -- I don't think that's very

11

complicated.

12

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

And then, I mean, if

13

that's the way it's viewed, then on the first time

14

period, the (h)(8), then we would stand on our -- stand

15

on either of the -- the waiver and estoppel argument or

16

also on the possibility that another middle ground

17

would be if what we're missing is a finding in the

18

record, the other option would be to remand for the

19

court to clarify the record.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22
23

Which court?
Oh, no, that --

pardon?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- is that -- is there

24

any reason to believe that the judge, of course, would

25

clarify it and say the ends of justice, if we took your

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

remand solution.

2

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

And obviously,

3

ordinarily courts would not be doing that.

4

inefficient thing to do in the ordinary course.

5

here, where the transcript does reflect the court

6

actually considered, on the one hand, the defendant's

7

need for additional time and, on the other hand, the

8

interest in trying -- trying criminal cases sooner

9

rather than later and balanced them by granting a lesser

10

But

--

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. JOSEFFER:

13

It's a very

Well --

It does seem more reasonable.

But --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It seems to me that in

15

this case, that -- that all-purpose waiver that the

16

judge, and not for the first time, proposed is -- is what

17

caused all this.

18

knowing that this was the judge's practice -- and

19

indeed, he had written about it -- did the U.S.

20

Attorney's Office try to do something to say, look, the

21

act doesn't permit that kind of thing?

22

And -- and my question that I had is

MR. JOSEFFER:

At -- at the time, I mean,

23

there was -- there was -- especially this was 10 years

24

ago.

25

confusion in the bar on these issues because there's no

There was, in some sense still is, quite a lot of

49
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

express anti-waiver provision.

2

I said, the -- the Second Circuit in Gambino had held

3

waiver is not ordinarily appropriate, but had not said

4

it was never appropriate.

5

There's an end, and as

So there was some confusion.

But what -- what the Government never did was

6

to encourage a waiver or to encourage any of these

7

delays either.

8
9
10

Now, in this -- I blurred to some extent in the
second question presented and talking about the -- the
remand and the harmlessness.

11

On the second question presented, the first

12

question is whether the incompetency exclusion applies

13

in the first place.

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, the -- the act has a

3

lengthy series of these resulting from exclusions, and

4

with the exception of (h)(8), which is unusual in terms

5

of the ends of justice finding, these operate

automatically as this Court said in Henderson.

it's an objective standard.

9

resulted, at least as a concurrent cause, from that.

10

It's --

If -- if the defendant

And there's -- and it's -- it's very

11

important to understand too that in the context of

12

especially the -- the exclusion for when pretrial

13

motions are pending, the courts of appeals have

14

unanimously held that a more complicated causation

15

analysis not only is not required but would throw a

16

wrench into the practical application of the act

17

because what happens, for example, is someone files a

18

pretrial motion and the parties assume that the -- the

19

clock is turned off then for at least some time.

20

defendant later argues that, well, the same delay would

21

have resulted anyway because, say, the judge was on

22

vacation or the judge was planning on recusing himself

23

and reassigning the case.

24

figure out which of several potential causes is -- is

I

And it also, as -- as the -- the other side

13

points out, it -- it puts considerable pressure on the

14

judge when -- when he is in violation of the Speedy Trial

15

Act, to find that the individual is incompetent

16

because, otherwise, there has to be a dismissal.

17

MR. JOSEFFER:

I -- I don't think it's

18

appropriate to presume that an Article III judge would

19

have a defendant imprisoned and committed if he was not

20

actually incompetent.

21

But you are right that the incompetency

22

exclusion is -- is, along with the unavailability of

23

the defendant or witness exclusions, are somewhat

24

unusual in that you could discover, after the fact,

25

that they applied.

But the reason is that if -- if you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

had tried to try him sooner, you would have discovered

the same thing.

defendant when he was legally unable to be tried.

prosecutor was having a difficult pregnancy and she was

MR. JOSEFFER:

We haven't relied on that

13

because that would have been the -- that -- that's an

14

appropriate basis for an ends of justice continuance,

15

but no continuance was ever sought or granted for the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD S. ZAS

25

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Thank you, counsel.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ZAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to pick

2

up on questions that both you and Justice Scalia asked

3

regarding the -- the language of the statute.

4

One of the Court's bedrock principles is that

5

judges are not free to rewrite the statute that

6

Congress has enacted.

7

statutory scheme here speaks very clearly and very

8

precisely, and it would be unwise, even if permitted,

9

for the Court to start tinkering with it because the

This statute and the whole

10

whole system will start to unravel if the -- if the

11

requirement of express findings and reasons turns into

12

a could have/would have/should have contest, in which

13

case trial judges will take the act less seriously

14

knowing that the court of appeals could make the

15

findings for them.

16

appeals' job harder because they'll be guessing after

17

the fact what discretionary decision the trial judge

18

would have made.

19

And it will make the court of

This statute -- the ends of justice provision

20

is very clear.

21

and it controls.

22

whether they could have been made or should have been

23

made or would have been made, they weren't made, and

24

therefore, the time ran and dismissal is required.

25

The Government has cited no ambiguity,
Because the findings were not made,

Now, the Government proceeds under the false

58
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

assumption that but for the waiver, the judge would

2

have granted this continuance on January 31, 1997.

3

There's absolutely no support for that in the record.

4

Even before this occasion, on November 8th, 1996, which

5

was the prior court appearance, the court said you're

6

not getting another adjournment unless you waive for

7

all time.

8

later date the court was about to say, well, forget the

9

waiver, okay, I'll give you 3 months.

So there's no reason to think that at this

It's -- it's the

10

waiver that is providing the basis for the exclusion.

11

The judge, if pushed, would have said, no, we're going

12

to trial soon.

13

false assumption.

14

No waiver, no more time.

So it's a

I'd like to turn to the second period again.

15

The Government again assumes that when the judge found

16

Mr. Zedner incompetent in March of 2001, that that is a

17

retroactive determination that he was incompetent from

18

July, August, September, October, November, et cetera.

19

And as the Court is aware --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It goes back some way

21

because he's looking at reports from those earlier

22

times.

23

the finding.

24
25

It's not only effective as of the date he makes

MR. ZAS:

Well, the -- the finding is

effective from that point forward.

That has to be the

59
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

case because, as Justice Scalia pointed out, it's

2

important for the parties to know, as matters are

3

unfolding, what the speedy trial clock is.

4

the Government knows to push the cases that are

5

approaching the 70-day limit to trial.

6

know that answer if everyone is waiting to find out

7

what the outcome of a pending motion is.

8

defendant, in fact, couldn't move for dismissal under

9

the act until the -- the judge said after 1 or 2 years,

JUSTICE ALITO:

found the defendant competent, had said expressly, and

16

I -- I made this determination in my mind shortly after

17

the hearing and the -- the briefs that were submitted

18

at that time, but now I'm putting it on the record,

19

that wouldn't be sufficient?

20

MR. ZAS:

No, Your Honor.

If the judge had

21

said, I knew this all along back when I heard the

22

evidence that this defendant was incompetent, that

would be an even more egregious violation.

MR. ZAS:

The

10

end, it excludes only delay reasonably attributable to

11

any period not to exceed 30 days during which any

12

proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under

13

advisement by the court.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

So -- so if the -No.

But there's no

15

provision, is there, that says that the finding under

16

(b)(4), that there has to even be a finding under

17

(b)(4), much less when the finding has to be made?

18
19
20

MR. ZAS:

If I may answer the question, Your

Honor.
Well, the only finding that the court has to

21

make under (b)(4) is that the defendant is incompetent.

22

That automatically will exclude the time going forward

23

until the defendant is restored to competency.
