ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. LONG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The search in this case was not based on

11

individualized suspicion, and no other adequate

12

safeguards limited the police officer's discretion to

13

search Petitioner.

14

would not be permitted by virtually any other State or

15

by the Federal Government, was unreasonable.

16

For this reason, the search, which

The Court has reaffirmed many times that the

17

Fourth Amendment does not permit the individual officer

18

in the field to exercise unconstrained discretion to

19

search.

20

is primarily directed at the evil -- it was primarily

21

directed at the evil of general warrants and writs of

22

assistance, and the evil of general warrants and writs

23

of assistance was that they gave individual officers

24

blanket authority to search where they pleased and

25

placed the liberty of every man in the hands of every

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Long -Mr. Long --

liberty, as it -- it's not disputed, is it, that your

client could have had his parole revoked even though

the search was suspicionless?

the difference between revocation of parole, on the one

9

hand, and a separate criminal offense.

So, what we're talking about

Is that right?

Well, a parolee has conditional

liberty.

But, at the time of this search, Mr. Samson

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought that

15

evidence seized could be introduced, could be a basis

16

to revoke parole.

MR. LONG:

Oh, well, the Court held, in the

18

Scott case, that the exclusionary rule does not apply

19

at parole revocation hearings.

Fourth Amendment, the evidence could not be admitted at

separate criminal offense.

7

MR. LONG:

I understand your question.

In

8

California, Justice Ginsburg, a nonviolent drug

9

offense, the possession of a small amount of an illegal

10

substance, is not a basis for revocation of parole.

11

is not possible to revoke parole in California for this

12

offense.

13

possibility here.

14

It

So, parole revocation would not have been a

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

15

suppose, can pursue her own line of questioning, but

this, to me at least.

"Now, look, I'm going to search you.

19

consent, then I'm going to revoke your parole."

20

MR. LONG:

Suppose the parole officer said,

Well, this, of course, was a

21

police officer, not a parole officer.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. LONG:

MR. LONG:

"And, if you don't, I'll revoke

I mean, California has said, the Supreme Court

has said, parole, in the parole search condition, is

No, but it's --

it's a privilege, that you get the privilege of parole

held, in People v. Reyes, and in other cases cited in

our brief, that, in California, parole is not a matter

23

of choice, it is imposed as a matter of law.

are sacrificed.

Do you --

MR. LONG:

And I want to be clear, we are not

15

-- we're arguing there is a broad spectrum of searches

16

that States can undertake of parolees, and I'm, by no

17

means, arguing today that all of them, or even most of

18

them, are unconstitutional.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This is a -What would you say about a

20

condition that you must -- not a regular drug test --

21

you just have to submit yourself to a drug test

22

narrower, because it would simply be a drug test.

1

the randomness of it is often a critical element.

suppose it makes much more sense to say you're subject

to a random drug test than that you have to come in at

refrain from using drugs prior to the test.

about a drug test.

process that doesn't leave it up to each individual

17

officer to decide who gets the drug test or which car

18

to stop to check the driver's license and registration.

19

What the Court has consistently held is really at the

20

core of the Fourth Amendment is this notion of: the

MR. LONG:

I think it's a very different set

of circumstances if we have a parole officer.

This

Court has said, at least twice, in Griffin and in

Scott, that a parole officer has a different function.

that's a pretty powerful demonstration, but we do have,

beyond that, empirically, California was with all the

MR. NIVER:

it was a probation condition, but I think that it --

4

obviously, the same analysis applies here -- that the

imposition or acceptance of a -- of a search condition

diminished expectation of privacy enjoyed by the
