ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
On the date of his death Francis Romani owned

12

13

real property worth about $50,000.

That property was

14

subject to a private judgment lien and to a later-filed

15

Federal tax lien.

16

exceeded the value of the estate, and the estate therefore

17

brought this case to determine whether the claim of the

18

United States or the claim of the private judgment

19

creditor should be paid first.

Both of the liens were for amounts that

The answer to that question appears in the

20
21

direct text of what is known as the absolute priority

22

statute.

23

rule for the narrow category of cases in which the United

24

States seeks to recover a claim against an insolvent

25

estate.

Since 1797, that statute has provided a simple

QUESTION:

Well, the statute is different in

2

this respect.

3

question, which I think was 1982, it talked in terms of

4

debt.

5

and it seems to me that a -- that the word claim may be

6

quite different than debt.

7

the connotation of something that's not -- that's

8

ambulatory, or that hasn't been executed yet, whereas debt

9

sounds as if it's something that's fixed.

10

Until the revision of the statute in

3713(a) at page 2 of your brief talks about claim,

MR. JONES:

Claim sounds to me as -- has

When Congress enacted that provision

11

in 1982 they said it was a formal change of language that

12

was not intended to change the scope of the statute.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. JONES:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. JONES:

But the language still is different.
The language is -One is claim, and the other is debt.
The language is different, but

17

Congress didn't intend it to have a different meaning, but

18

moreover --

QUESTION:

20

MR. JONES:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

How do you know that?
That's -- the legislative history -Well, but, you know we don't always

pay a lot of attention to legislative history.
MR. JONES:

It's -- you may not always pay a lot

24

of attention to it, but in the context where a change has

25

been made to words, and the question is whether that

1

changed the meaning of the statute, it's appropriate to

2

look to the legislative history, especially when Congress

3

says in that history, we're not changing the meaning.

4

That should be authoritative.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. JONES:

7

There is an answer, I think, in any event to

But --

A committee says in that regard.
That's correct.

8

your question apart from that, and that is -- I may be --

9

I may have the wrong case, but I think it's United States

10

v. Moore where the Court said that whether the claim is

11

unliquidated or not, it's still covered by the absolute

12

priority statute.

13

But the importance of the absolute priority

14

statute is that it provides the simple rule that the

15

United States shall be paid first.

16
17

QUESTION:

and 6323(a), which deal specifically with tax liens?

18
19

Well then, what's the point of 6321

MR. JONES:

Yes, that's indeed the ultimate

question in the case.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. JONES:

Yes.
Does that statute change the

22

application of the absolute priority statute for tax

23

claims?

24

and we say it doesn't.

25

The Pennsylvania supreme court said that it did,

The rationale of the Pennsylvania supreme court

1

was that this tax lien statute provides a limitation on

2

the effectiveness of the Federal tax lien, and that by

3

limiting the validity of the lien, you limit the priority

4

of the United States, but in United States v. Key and

5

United States v. Emory the Court said that only the

6

plainest inconsistency between two statutory schemes would

7

justify disregarding this ancient and clear command that

8

the United States be paid first.
There is no claim inconsistency between these

9
10

statutory schemes.

The absolute priority statute is a

11

priority statute.

12

United States.

13

and United States v. Vermont, this Court held exactly

14

that, that the right of the United States under the

15

absolute priority statute exists wholly without regard to

16

the existence of any lien.

It does not require any lien of the

In United States v. City of New Britain,

QUESTION:

17

But in the New Britain case they

18

discussed at great length the tax lien statutes, too, did

19

they not?

20

MR. JONES:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, because that -Well, why would that have been

22

necessary if the only holding of the case was that it's

23

governed by the absolute priority statute?

MR. JONES:

not, by its terms, apply, and the very important part of

2

that opinion for this purpose is what the Court went on to

3

say about how the Tax Lien Act applies in that situation.

4

What the Court said was, the Tax Lien Act only

5

determines the validity of the Federal lien.

by its terms, contain any priority provisions.

7

8

said that to determine priorities we look to the

background common law rule of first in time is first in
10

right, unless that has been modified by statute, and the

11

Court pointed out that in the insolvency situations to

12

which the absolute priority statute applies, it has been

13

modified by statute.

14

Congress provided specifically since 17 7 that

15

in the narrow category of cases involving insolvent

16

estates the United States is to be paid first.

Congress specifically has provided

22

that bankruptcy cases are to be determined not under the

23

absolute priority statute but under the priority

24

provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

in one context and a different apply in different

contexts.

3

QUESTION:

But if the debtor is insolvent and

4

dies, then you say this 3713 has to apply, even if it's a

5

tax that we're talking about.
MR. JONES:

6

Absolutely.

Congress said that, but

7

more important -- well, equally importantly, this Court

8

has said that no less than seven times in the last 180

9

years.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Well, what if under 3713 instead of a

judgment lien there had been a prior recorded mortgage?
MR. JONES:

Well, that takes us to the heart of

13

an ancient dispute that this Court has, by its express

14

statements, never resolved.

15
16

QUESTION:

Well, what's your position?

Suppose

there was a prior recorded mortgage here --

The --- and we were talking about that in

the case of an insolvent who dies --

MR. JONES:

The Court --

21

QUESTION:

-- versus the Government's claim.

22

MR. JONES:

In New York v. Maclay, for example,

23

the Court said a mortgage is more than a lien, that it is

24

closer to a title and possession of the property, and --

25

QUESTION:

Well, do you concede that in the

mortgage situation the mortgage holder would come out

2

ahead of the Government here --

3

MR. JONES:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. JONES:

6

-- if it were a recorded mortgage?
I would concede it to this extent.

The Court so stated that in Thelusson.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. JONES:

9

I would --

Yes.
The Court confirmed that in the

Maclay case, but I believe it was in either Mass -- United

10

States v. Massachusetts or United States v. Texas, in one

11

of those two opinions when they were reciting the well-

12

established rule about we prevail against judgment liens

13

but we may not prevail against mortgages, the Court said

14

something to the effect that if the mortgage cases are

15

still valid.

16

Now -- and so I suppose that what the Court was

17

saying then was, they weren't revisiting to decide whether

18

the mortgage case --

your position is if it were.

They're usually called mechanic's liens, and

here Congress has a specific statute that says, you know,

20

that means is, we get it first.

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

5

MR. JONES:

6

That's not right?
First of all -I was reading 632 -- yes.
-- the absolute priority statute

doesn't create a lien.

7

QUESTION:

I mean, I'm taking -- a lien is just

8

a magic way of saying the Government gets paid first,

9

think.

10

MR. JONES:

I

It's not a -- it's not that kind of

11

a magic word, and this Court has made the very distinction

12

on this subject, and so it's important for me to emphasize

13

it.

14

The right of the United States under the

15

absolute priority statute does not depend upon the

16

existence of any lien, valid or not.

17

what the Court has described in I think seven cases that

18

we've cited.

19

lien, which is a lien that does not -- as the Court said

20

in Thelusson all the way to Gilbert Associates, a general

21

lien does not divest title or possession from the United

22

States.

23

therefore the United States is to be paid first.

24
25

It defeats any --

It defeats anything that is a quote, general

The property remains in the debtor's estate and

And so, is the -- so the question that I believe
was implicit in your remark was, is a mechanic's lien a

general lien covered -- you know, which the United States

2

prevails, or is it a specific lien that might come in

3

ahead of the United States under the absolute priority

4

statute.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. JONES:

Yes.
My perception of that is that if the

7

Court had to reach it, under its precedent it would hold

8

that it was a general lien, although it could hold it was

9

a specific --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. JONES:

12

And not like a mortgage.
It's certainly not exactly like a

mortgage.
QUESTION:

13

So then my question actually is --

14

thank you, that is much clearer, and my question really is

15

what any Congressman or Senator would have had in mind in

16

saying that my goodness, we want to be certain those

17

mechanics who come in and fix the roof are paid before the

18

IRS, and that's what they seem to say in 1623 and, in

19

fact, if we're reading of the statute is correct, every

20

time a person dies insolvent the IRS gets paid before the

21

mechanics.

22

Now, that to me just doesn't make any sense.
MR. JONES:

Well, I'm not -- I'm not saying what

23

our position is on mechanic's liens, because I can hear an

24

argument to be made for saying, oh, that's a specific lien

25

within the context of how the Court uses that term.

But let's take the judgment lien, which is also

1

2

referred to in 6323, and which the Court's opinions say

3

clearly we prevail against under the absolute priority

4

statute.

5

Did Congress intend, in adopting 6323, to repeal

6

the application of the absolute priority statute to

7

judgment liens?

8

at the same -- in terms of intent, at the same time that

9

the repealing legislation was presented for -- I mean,

10

that the Federal tax lien legislation was presented to

11

Congress in 1966, Congress was also presented with three

12

bills designed expressly to repeal the application of this

13

statute to tax claims.

14

The answer to that is no.

Why?

Because

Congress conducted hearings on those

15

legislation, informed itself of the objections, and

16

declined to enact it.

Yes.
I'm normally with you on legislative

21

history, but I'm getting off the train in this instance

22

for the reason that I'd ask before these particular bills,

of what sense it would make?

MR. JONES:

What sense would it make --

like 6323, we normally put all these things ahead of the

7

The sense that it --- we don't put it ahead when the

I'm looking for some sense in that.

MR. JONES:

The sense that it makes is, when the

8

tax lien provisions are applicable, they're applicable

9

within a priority context determined by some other statute

10

or legislation.

In the situation you've described, if he

11

goes into bankruptcy, then it's the Bankruptcy Code that

12

prevails, the Bankruptcy Code that is operative.

13

All that the tax lien provisions say is whether

14

we have a valid lien, and then you should ask, so what if

15

we don't have a valid lien, and the answer under the

16

absolute priority statute is --

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones --

18

MR. JONES:

-- it doesn't matter.

19

QUESTION:

You are presenting the position as

though it's clear and certain this is the Government's

position, the only question mark is what this Court may

have done in some mortgage cases, and yet the red brief

But you

MR. JONES:

1

Well, one of the reasons we don't

all of that portion of their argument relates to an issue

If their reading of the statute is

correct, namely that the -- what you call an absolute

an issue about whether a mortgage takes priority under the

proposition, which --we don't intend to dispute Conard.

These are different rules.

QUESTION:

That's the issue.

Congress -If we were to say

MR. JONES:

That is -- well, I wouldn't think

you'd say that for a variety of reasons.

One is, the

QUESTION:

But are you saying that priorities,

And in the vast majority of those

different priority schemes, because the absolute priority

MR. JONES:

was before, this Court has said it doesn't matter, because

13

in United States v. Moore, and all the way back in 1824, I

14

think, in the Bank of North Carolina case, the Court said

15

that whatever the common law rule is, this priority of the

16

United States arises solely by statute, and it is

17

interpreting that statute that the Court has said, seven

18

times since 1817, that a general lien such as a judgment

lien, or a State and municipal tax lien, or a landlord's

20

lien does not prevail against the absolute priority of the

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

The theory that the Court has is

that to be specific for purposes of the absolute priority

7

statute you have to divest title or possession of the good

8

from the debtor's estate before the claim of the United

9

States arises.

10

QUESTION:

So then in mortgage lien States, as

11

distinguished from title States, then in the lien States

12

the creditor would lose.

MR. JONES:

Justice Cardozo who addressed that

14

very point in New York v. Maclay, and he said, well, I

don't have -- I can't decide now whether a lien State the

I only want

11

make.

12

Going all the way back to 1805, in the first

13

case that this Court decided under the absolute priority

14

statute, Chief Justice Marshall said for this Court that

the inconvenience of the statute did not justify its

question posed by Justice Stevens, which is whether

2

antecedent security interests, traditional security

3

interests survive assertion of the priority of the United

4

States Government under the priority statute.

5

We did not handle this case below, and cannot

6

tell the Court, therefore, why it was not discussed below,

7

but I can and do say that it is clearly embraced within

8

the question presented by the Government in its petition.

9

That is why they argued this issue at pages 9 and 10 of

10

the petition, and why they reargued it at pages 14 and 16

11

of their opening brief on the merits here.
The statute under which the Government claims

12

13

priority had its origins in the prerogative of the Crown

14

for the payment of debts due to the sovereign.

15

was enacted, there was more than a century of English

16

precedent to the effect that antecedent security interests

17

would survive assertion of a priority under the

prerogative of the Crown.

11 years later,

1

this Court decided Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Company,

2

stating, and it was essentially the same Court, that

3

Conard should be limited -- or, excuse me, that Thelusson

4

should be limited to the circumstances of that case, and

5

stating unequivocally that Thelusson did not stand for the

6

proposition that a perfected lien could be displaced by,

7

and I quote, the mere priority of the Government under

8

Revised Code section 3466.

9

Subsequently, this Court, in United States v.

10

Hack and Brent v. Bank of Washington, upheld traditional

11

security interests against assertion of priority under the

12

priority statute.

13

For a period of 75 years thereafter, it was the

14

understanding of the lower Federal courts that traditional

15

security interests would survive assertion of priority by

16

the Government under this statute.

17

The Attorney General of the United States in

18

1857 issued an opinion to the effect that Thelusson was

19

overruled by Conard, and that was the understanding, that

20

was the assumption, that was the premise on which the

lower Federal courts acted from that point on.

Let me address next the question of the

interaction of these two statutes. The Government would

make it appear that the only issue here is whether there

is an implied exception to the priority statute, when in

10

fact the issue is really whether there is an implied

11

exception to one statute or an implied limitation on

12

another, as I think Justice Breyer suggested.
There are really two separate and distinct

13
14

questions presented by this phase of the case.

15

whether the competing statutes are inconsistent within

16

some range of overlapping application.
QUESTION:

logical inconsistency between the two statutes, secondly,

2

would application of the priority statute make the

3

subsequently enacted and more specific statute redundant,

4

or does the legislative history in any way suggest a

5

congressional intention to carve out an exception to the

priority statute?
I submit that while it is doubtful in my mind

7
8

that in a case that didn't even involve an inconsistency

9

the Court was setting forth an overarching test to resolve

10

all of these cases, I submit the situation here does

11

satisfy the test that was set forth in United States v.

12

Key.

13

To begin with, the competing statutes are

14

inconsistent, and they are inconsistent in the very area

15

presented by this case.

claimant as well as a lien-holder, and we would prefer to

20

proceed as the holder of a tax claim rather than as a

21

lien-holder.

22

If you think about that, it's another way of

saying that the Government should stand in a better

position as an unsecured creditor than as a secured

Suppose they're right, then where -- suppose they're

right, in other words, that the priority statute applies.

It couldn't apply to dead people, because

full force when a trustee in bankruptcy, acting under

trustee status of a hypothetical judgment lien creditor at

The trustee would refer to the Tax Lien Act to
determine if a Federal tax lien were involved, it had been

statute would kick in to determine how these payment would

be made and to whom and in what order, and in that

situation, Your Honor, the Government would apply in the

Now, with respect to the legislative history,

the Government points to two proposals that were advanced

to the Federal tax lien -- or, excuse me, to the priority

statute.

is involved in this case.

1

reading of the statute was in the first part of your

2

brief?

3

MR. McCARTAN:

No, Your Honor.

In fact, in the

4

final report of the ABA, which is referred to in the

5

legislative history, I think it is clear that the ABA at

6

that point thought that one of the proposals that was

7

being advanced was really to clarify that traditional

8

security interests have always survived assertion of

9

priority by the Government under the statute.

10

In other words, with respect to that specific

11

proposal, which was part of a much larger package, the ABA

12

was of the view that they were really conforming law to

13

what traditionally it had understood to be, contrary to

14

the suggestion in some cases.

15

If you look at the legislative history of this

16

statute in terms of how the structure of the statute has

17

evolved over time, I think it is also clear that we meet

18

the test set forth in The United States v. Key.

19

statute that started out as a means of facilitating tax

20

collection on the part of the Government.

21

there has been a steady expansion of the protection

22

afforded to competing creditors, and if you look at the

23

committee report of the 1913 statute, Congress was of the

24

view at that time that they were putting these other

25

creditors on an equal footing with the Government in tax

This is a

Over the years,

1

2

matters.
In 1966, the 1966 amendments, which gave even

3

unsecured creditors, Justice Breyer, priority over a

4

properly filed and perfected Federal tax lien, Congress

5

said that these amendments were designed to bring the

6

Federal Tax Lien Act in conformity with the provisions of

7

the Uniform Commercial Code, and under Article 9 of the

8

Uniform Commercial Code, secured claims are always given

9

preference over unsecured claims.

10

So I think that in terms of whether we have

11

satisfied the standards set forth in the United States v.

12

Key, it is clear that we have.

13

With respect to the cases relied upon by the

14

Government, I want to emphasize that in the case of New

15

York v. Maclay you had a situation of a State lien, State

16

franchise tax lien that was designed to cover all property

17

of the debtor that were accrued in advance of the years in

18

which the amount of taxes were due, so you had an amount

19

that was undetermined, you had property that was

20

undetermined.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

It wouldn't have been a perfected

lien under the Uniform Commercial Code.
MR. McCARTAN:

It would not have been a

24

perfected lien under the Uniform Commercial Code or under

25

any other standard, Justice Scalia, that I can consider.

The same was true of United States v. Texas,

2

another case on which the Government relies very heavily.

3

In that case, the amount of the lien was undetermined.

4

required judicial proceedings to determine the amount.

5

The property there was not only all property used in the

6

business, but all property that might thereafter be

7

acquired, far different from the property in this case

8

located within the county in which this judgment was

9

entered, indexed, and perfected as a lien.
Every other case that is relied upon by the

10
11

Government involved -- and which turned on possession of

12

the property involved, was a case involving personal

13

property.

So all of these cases on which the Government

relies, the so-called modern cases, are really just

MR. McCARTAN:

That's right, Your Honor, and all

2

of the cases that the Government relies on have turned on

3

the requirement of possession for the property, as

4

enunciated in Thelusson v. Smith, have involved personal

5

property.

6

QUESTION:

So you're just saying that that

7

feature makes it impossible for the Government to claim

8

authority from those cases, rather than those features

9

should be regarded by us as a basis for present law.
MR. McCARTAN:

10

That's correct, Justice Souter,

11

and I think that, too, is really why stare decisis is not

12

implicated here, in addition to several other reasons, but

13

these cases on which they rely do involve personal

14

property and not real property, and if we're talking about

15

stare decisis we have to go back to Conard v. Atlantic

16

Insurance Company, and there the Court was of the view

17

that Thelusson should be limited to its facts, and that

18

the requirement that the judgment creditor obtain title or

19

possession of the property was limited to the facts in

20

that case.

21

QUESTION:

Was Thelusson personal property?

22

MR. McCARTAN:

No.

Thelusson was real property,

Your Honor, but in Thelusson the judgment creditor was

attempting to reach the proceeds of the sale of the

property and, as the Court pointed out in Conard, what the

the land rather than the proceeds from the sale of the

land, and that is why Thelusson was being limited to what

that a perfected lien could be displaced by the mere

QUESTION:

The Court was very

And that's the position you say the

Attorney General in that 1857 opinion -MR. McCARTAN:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

12

In 1857 the Attorney General's opinion was to the effect

13

that Thelusson had been overruled, not just limited to the

circumstances of the case, and that the priority statute

would not reach back over liens general or specific that

were antecedent to the accrual of the Government's claim.

overrule it.

QUESTION:

But normally a lien attaches to the

proceeds, or I mean -- well, anyway, go ahead.

4

MR. McCARTAN:

You see what I mean, though, that

5

the distinction made in Conard would permit the Court to

6

proceed on the basis of Conard without addressing

7

specifically the issue of whether Thelusson should be

8

overruled.

9

As this Court said in Rankin, the judgment lien

10

does follow the property and can be foreclosed, even in

11

the case where a junior lienholder or unsecured creditor

12

has moved against the property in the first instance.

3

I submit that the Government's position in this

4

case, and we are talking about real property, confuses

5

what is necessary to perfect a lien with respect to that

6

property with satisfaction of the underlying judgment.

7

Requiring a creditor to take possession of the property or

8

to foreclose on the lien is a means of satisfying the

9

underlying obligation.

20

It is not required to perfect the lien under

21

modern recording statutes, and the only cases that would

22

indicate to the contrary are cases that have involved

23

unspecified personal property or real property that could

24

not be identified.

25

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. JONES:

Thank you.

14

There are basically two propositions respondent

15

makes.

16

a distinction that's recognized for 180 years, from

17

Thelusson through Gilbert Associates, between a general

18

lien that does not defeat the absolute priority of the

19

United States and a more specific lien that may.

20

One is that the Court should disclaim reliance on

The Court has held -- I'm repeating myself,

21

probably, but I think seven times that a judgment lien is

22

such a general lien and that the priority of the United

23

States prevails against it.

24

respect to personal property, it's said it at least twice

25

with respect to real property.

It's said it not only with

In United States v. Texas in

1

94

the Court

2

said, and I'm quoting from page 7 of our brief, but I'm

3

quoting the Court's opinion, a general judgment lien upon

4

the land of an insolvent debtor does not take precedence

5

over claims of the United States unless execution of the

6

judgment has proceeded far enough to take the land out of

7

the possession of the debtor.

8

QUESTION:

9
10

was that the lien in that case was not perfected.

The

amount was not even established.
MR. JONES:

11
12

Mr. McCartan's point, as I recall,

He's confusing something that this

Court has made clear shouldn't be confused, and that is

3

the standards for specificity under the Federal Tax Lien

4

Act, as contrasted with the standards for specificity

5

under the absolute priority statute.

6

The Court in Vermont and in New Britain made

7

clear that those are really two entirely different

8

questions.

9

is, is there a State lien, and the answer is yes if it's

The question under the Federal Tax Lien Act

20

become definite in terms of the name of the lienor, the

21

amount of the lien, and the property to which it applies.

22

But as the Court explained in Vermont, the

23

question of whether you have a specific lien for purposes

24

of the absolute priority statute is a different one, and

25

turns on whether, as the Court said in that case, the

1

debtor has been divested of title

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. JONES:

Well, why should they be different?
They are different because the

4

statutes have different scopes and application, which this

5

Court has clearly held in at least two cases this century.

6

QUESTION:

Is it -- was the distinction, or

7

they're saying they're different based on the difference

8

in language in the statutes?

9

MR. JONES:

And the statute's objectives, yes.

10

I mean, it goes back to the language.

11

priority statute simply says we get paid first, and the

12

question is, well, is there something that prevents that

13

from happening, and the Court's answer has been, well, if

14

the property has been taken away from the debtor, then you

15

don't get paid first.

16

The absolute

If it's been taken away from the debtor by

17

something so specific, like a mortgage, then you don't get

18

paid first, but if it's just a general claim against that

19

property, you still get paid first, because it's still in

20

the possession of the debtor, and the statute says, and

21

the Court says we obey the plain language of the statute

22

that the United States gets paid first.
To reach a different conclusion the Court would

23
24

have to overrule no less than seven opinions over the last

25

180 years.

The cases that he says are his best cases for

this proposition were all in the early part of the 19th

2

Century.

3

stand for the proposition that he contends.

They don't -- as our brief describes, they don't

4

This Court has expressly limited the application

5

of those cases to the mortgage situation in the Maclay,

6

New York v. Maclay, that's what Justice Cardozo carefully

7

explained.

8

The second argument that they make is that this

9

statute, this application of the absolute priority statute

10

somehow makes the Federal tax lien provisions meaningless,

11

which if you think about it is a preposterous contention

12

that has absolutely no support for it.

13

The Federal tax lien provisions of course apply

14

in the ordinary situations that the absolute priority

15

statute doesn't apply.

16

they will determine whose lien comes first, where it

17

matters whether your lien came first or not.

In bankruptcy court, for example,
