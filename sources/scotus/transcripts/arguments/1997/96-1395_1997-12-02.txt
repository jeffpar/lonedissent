ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Each of the six Federal employees in this case

12

engaged in sanctionable employment-related misconduct and

13

then knowingly and intentionally falsely denied the

14

misconduct when questioned by agency investigators.

15

The court below held, however, that as a matter

16

of constitutional due process the Government, as employer,

17

may not charge these employees with both misconduct and

18

lying about the misconduct.

19

that to hold that an employee's deliberate falsification

20

may not even be considered in determining the penalty for

21

the separate underlying misconduct.

22

Indeed, the court went beyond

There is nothing whatsoever in the Due Process

23

Clause or anywhere else in the Constitution, for that

24

matter, that prevents a Government agency from sanctioning

25

an employee who deliberately lies in response to questions

1

about employment misconduct, whether or not the employee

2

is also sanctioned for the misconduct itself.

3

When the Government acts as an employer, it has

4

the right to demand that its employees respond honestly to

5

work-related questions and to sanction them if they do

6

not, just as all other employers do.

7

Government has more reason to demand honesty from its

8

employees, as they employ -- as they enjoy a public trust.

9

As this Court held in Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, the

Indeed, the

10

Government has a compelling interest in honest civil

11

service.
The holding of the Federal Circuit in this case

12

13

imposes profound anomalies and perverse incentives.

14

Wrongdoers who tell the truth are required under this

15

holding to be punished just as severely as wrongdoers who

16

then knowingly and intentionally lie about their

17

misconduct when questioned by an investigator or a

18

tribunal.

19

An employee who is questioned about wrongdoing

20

can be punished for lying about it if he didn't do any

21

wrong, but if he did do wrong and lies about it, he can't

22

be separately punished for lying about it.

23

Under the Federal Circuit rule, a rational

24

employee questioned about wrongdoing will always lie,

25

since it's cost-free and perhaps he will fool or dissuade

1

the agency.

2

indeed, I think it's fair to say that the consequences,

3

that the rationale of the Federal Circuit's decision in

4

this case goes beyond just what the individual agency can

5

do and presumably would also prevent the Government in its

6

sovereign capacity from making the false statements

7

"costly" by prosecuting them either under 1001 or, if

8

their statements were under oath, for perjury.

9

He would be irrational to 'fess up and,

So we submit that the decision of the Federal

10

Circuit in this case, which doesn't follow any decisions

11

by this Court or any decisions by any other Federal court,

12

is simply wrong as a matter of constitutional law.

13

QUESTION:

General Waxman, just for purposes of

14

discussion and not to indicate my view on what the Court's

15

likely to do in the preceding case, but let's assume we

16

recognize an exculpatory no doctrine, does that have any

17

spillover effect in this situation?

18

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Boy, the only spillover effect

19

it could have, Justice O'Connor, would be if you found an

20

exculpatory no doctrine required as a matter of

21

constitutional law, because the argument in favor of the

22

exculpatory no doctrine in every court that has adopted

23

some form of it has done so as a matter of statutory

24

construction, trying to define what Congress could have

25

intended.

There's no statute at issue in this case that

QUESTION:

I suppose the moral of that is don't

GENERAL WAXMAN:

That's the moral that we hope

14

people will derive from the long line of cases in which

15

this Court has held that even where there are important

16

constitutional guarantees at issue,

that's one thing, but if it's just an oral translation,

2

how can you be sure that the one who's doing the interview

3

isn't dissembling?

4

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, a couple of answers.

5

First of all, in a number of the cases that are collected

6

in this -- before this Court, the false statements were

7

written.

8

questions, or a series of questions and provided written

9

answers.

That is, the employee was given a list of

In other instances, the employees either

10

11

repeated or made their lies after they were put under

12

oath, so you can't characterize the Federal Circuit's

13

decision in this case as somehow limited to an informal

14

oral question by an investigator.

15

But even if you could, that might go to the

16

question of whether the agency could establish by a

17

preponderance of the evidence that the individual employee

18

had knowingly and with intent to deceive given a false

19

statement.

20

agency to establish that the misconduct had occurred, but

21

as a constitutional matter, I wouldn't think that any a

22

priori rule would be appropriate.

23

That is, it may make it more difficult for the

QUESTION:

Was the -- did the Federal Circuit in

24

this case rest its holding on any statutory ground, or was

25

it a purely constitutional holding?

GENERAL WAXMAN:

1

It is a purely constitutional

2

holding.

3

at issue in this case.

4

Federal Circuit cited the statute, although I may be

5

mistaken -- is 5 U.S.C. section 7513, which provides that

6

an agency may take action against an employee for

7

misconduct "only for such cause as will promote the

8

efficiency of the service."

9

The only statute that's really -- it's not even
I don't even think that the

And one of the things that the agency has to

10

establish by a preponderance of the evidence is not only,

11

of course, that the misconduct occurred, but that there is

12

a nexus between the sanction that the agency has imposed

13

and "the promotion of the efficiency of this -- of the

14

service."

15

decision of law.

That's required both in the statute and by a

QUESTION:

16

As I understand this panel of the

17

Federal Circuit, they were following a precedent already

18

set, and all these MSPB cases nowadays do go to that one

19

circuit.

20

used to get the court to sit en banc and perhaps

21

reconsider the precedent that was relied on in this case?

Was there any procedure that might have been

I -- sure.

We can ask that --

the Federal Circuit to reconsider any panel decision en

1

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

GENERAL WAXMAN:

-- I must say that although

3

several panels of the MSPB itself in several instances in

4

these cases felt that the result that was ultimately

5

reached by the Federal Circuit was dictated by Grubka, but

6

there are other -- there were other MSPB decisions that

7

basically distinguish Grubka.

8

9

I'm not certain, but I believe that we did ask
the Federal Circuit at least in this case to reconsider

10

this panel decision en banc.

11

in Grubka or not.

12

I don't know whether we did

Frankly, I think it's reading a lot into Grubka

13

to conclude that Grubka dictates the result that was

14

reached by the board and the Federal Circuit in this case.

15

That was a highly unusual case which is and was

16

distinguished by the MSPB subsequently on what I think are

17

reasonable grounds.

18

QUESTION:

There was one curiosity in the

19

Federal Circuit's opinion.

20

line between -- they said if it's at the investigative

21

stage then the employee could be punished.

22

GENERAL WAXMAN:

That is, they seemed to draw a

Was the --

They did say that, but it's a

23

little bit curious because all six of the employees in

24

this case were alleged and proven to have made -- to have

25

lied during the investigative stage.

Now, some of them also lied during the

1

2

"administrative stage," but one of the curious things

3

about the Federal Circuit's decision is that in dicta it

4

does say, well, of course due process wouldn't in any way

5

protect lying at the investigative stage, but that's

6

exactly what happened in each one of these cases.

7
8

If there are no further questions, I'd like to
reserve 10 minutes for rebuttal, if I may.

QUESTION:

Very well, General Waxman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL E. MARTH

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MARTH:

13
14

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
If the Court accepts the Government position in

15
16

this case that the Federal Circuit created a broad

17

constitutional right to lie, then the respondents lose,

18

because there is no such right, this Court has adamantly

19

over the years asserted that there is no such right, and

20

the respondents are not advocating that right in this

21

case.

22

If, on the other hand, this Court finds that the

23

Federal Circuit narrowly tailored a right to protect the

24

employee's meaningful right to respond to the charges,

25

then the respondents should prevail.

QUESTION:

Did you tell us that the question

2

presented was not presented in your opposition to the

3

petition, because the question presented surely says what

4

you say is not at issue here, whether the Due Process

5

Clause precludes a Federal -- the Due Process Clause

6

precludes a Federal agency from sanctioning an employee

7

for making false statements to the agency regarding

8

allegations that the employee had engaged in employment-

9

related conduct.

10
11
12

13

I mean, that's what I thought we were here to
talk about, and you're saying it is not.
MR. MARTH:

No, Your Honor, I'm not saying that.

I'm saying that --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. MARTH:

Oh.

I thought that's what you said.

-- that the Government in its brief

16

and in its argument has characterized this as a broad

17

constitutional right to lie, whereas it's the respondents'

18

position that the Federal Circuit said, in a very narrowly

19

tailored situation, to protect an employee's meaningful

20

right to respond, an employee can deny misconduct and put

21

the Government to its proof.

22

QUESTION:

23

QUESTION:

-- the Constitution required that.

24

MR. MARTH:

Your Honor, I disagree with General

Okay.

I see.

Waxman with regard to that issue.

relied on and quoted 5 U.S. Code 7513(b), which is the

2

provision which gives -- and I believe that's on page 11a

3

of the appendix -- which gives the employees certain

4

rights when charges are brought against them, and that

5

includes the right to counsel, the right to a detailed

6

statement of the charges, a right to have a period of time

7

of a minimum of 7 days to respond to those --

8

9
10

QUESTION:

And was that denied to these

respondents?
MR. MARTH:

That was not denied, but what the

11

court of appeals was saying, Your Honor, was that the

12

meaningful right to respond and the meaningful right to

13

have those rights was denied because early on before those

14

rights were ever given, they were -- in effect could be --

15

if an employee was forced to respond affirmatively to the

16

Government charges of misconduct, that that subsequent

17

meaningful right was denied.

18

QUESTION:

Well, if it was simply an

19

interpretation of the statute, why did the court of

20

appeals refer to the Due Process Clause?

21

MR. MARTH:

Well, the Due Process Clause comes

22

in because the court of appeals found that there was a

23

risk of erroneous deprivation in this case of those

24

subsequent rights if an employee was forced to respond

25

without a -- an opportunity to deny the misconduct at the

early stage.
QUESTION:

Let me ask my question again, then.

3

I thought I had an answer, but then -- then you go back

4

and said the same thing again.

5
6

7

Do you agree that the question presented here is
whether the Due Process Clause requires the outcome?
MR. MARTH:

Certainly, but the Due Process

8

Clause, Your Honor, is based on property rights, and the

9

property rights come from the statute.

10

QUESTION:

Well -- okay.

11

QUESTION:

And what in your opinion, Mr. Marth,

12

is the case from this Court that most closely supports the

13

result, the constitutional result reached by the court of

14

appeals here?

15

MR. MARTH:

Well, Your Honor, this Court has

16

never, to my knowledge, dealt with this issue in a Federal

17

employment context, where they have looked at the issues

18

in the context of Federal employment.

19

any case where this precise issue has certainly come

20

before the Court in the past.

21

QUESTION:

I'm not aware of

Well, even if the precise issue

22

hasn't, what is the constitutional decision from this

23

Court that most closely supports your position?

24
25

MR. MARTH:

Well, in Garrity v. State of New

Jersey this Court said that officers who are given the

choice of either answering questions or losing their jobs

2

had their Fourteenth Amendment rights violated, and the

3

statements they gave were not voluntary and could not be

4

used against them.

5

although certainly that is --

6

QUESTION:

That's probably the closest case,

There's no question of using the

7

statements here against these people in some other

8

proceeding, is there?

9
10

MR. MARTH:

You mean, whether or not these

statements could be used in another proceeding?

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. MARTH:

Yes.
Your Honor, I would -- or, Chief

13

Justice, I would say that there is no prohibition against

14

using those statements in another context, but --

15

QUESTION:

The Government isn't trying to use

16

them -- the Government isn't trying to obtain a criminal

17

conviction by using these statements in some sort of a

18

criminal proceeding, is it?

19

in the proceeding in which they were given.

20

MR. MARTH:

The statements were just used

That's correct, Your Honor, but the

21

employees certainly did not know that, and there are

22

several employees in this case, Barrett and Roberts, for

23

example, who could have been charged with taking

2

these employees, when they're brought into the

investigation stage, are not told by the Government

whether or not criminal consequences are contemplated.

QUESTION:

But no criminal consequences resulted

in these cases.

7

MR. MARTH:

That's correct, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

Now --

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Marth, you're drawing a large

10

distinction between the public and private sector, and as

11

I was reading your arguments I was thinking, in the case

12

that we just heard, it's something that can only be

13

between a Government and its citizens, but here we have an

14

employment setting.

15

Employees lie to private employers like they do

16

to public employers, so it seems to me you're extracting

17

from due process a right for a public employee that surely

does not exist in a private employer.

an employee to have to answer the question, but the

2

Federal Circuit and the Merit Systems Protection Board

3

have held that in any type of investigation an employee

4

does not have a right to refuse to cooperate, so --

5

QUESTION:

Oh, but that simply means that if the

In each instance, they're -- it seems to me, they're in

the same position, aren't they --

MR. MARTH:

MR. MARTH:

-- Your Honor, and even this case,

MR. MARTH:

9

What is the line?
The line is that -- the difference

between denying the charges, a simple denial of the

10

charges versus telling false tales or creating a story to

11

cover yourself.
QUESTION:

12

Well, in the case of the employee,

13

Ms. Kye, she asserted that she had lost or torn up her

14

Government credit cards, and yet that is not treated as a

15

false statement.

16

How do you draw the line there?

MR. MARTH:

Your Honor, basically the elements

17

of what the Government had to prove in her case was that

18

she had misused her credit card.

19

were, no I did not misuse my credit card, so that's where

20

the court of appeals came down.

21

look at the material facts that are elements of the

22

charge, in this case, did you misuse your Government

23

credit card, she denied it.

MR. MARTH:

And she also attempted, Your Honor,

2

to correct that later on, and when she attempted to

3

correct it, and that's one of the risks here, that when

4

that employee attempted to correct it she was charged with

falsifying evidence and her entire credibility --

Which, indeed, she had been doing.

That's a risk that she --

her own conduct.

MR. MARTH:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MARTH:

Yes, Your Honor.
So what's wrong with that?
Well, the danger here that if an

14

employee -- for example, in a couple of these cases they

15

were asking questions, in Ms. Walsh's case about some

16

conduct that occurred 3 years before, and in the Barrett

17

and Roberts case they were asking them how were they

18

spending a 2-hour period 14 months before.

19

So if an employee who answers, and blurts out an

20

answer -- when the Government asks, for example, in

21

Barrett and Roberts, were you working on Government

22

business on June 8, 14 months ago, between the hours of

23

1:30 and 3:30, they say, yes, we were.

24

MR. MARTH:

have pointed out in the former argument, what you have

15

here is, for examples, if somebody comes up, an

16

investigator says, were you 5 minutes late to work, and

17

you say, no, I wasn't 5 minutes late to work, well,

18

suddenly what was a 5-minutes-late-to-work charge, which

19

may involve a slap on the wrist, maybe even a written

reprimand, now becomes a removable offense.

3

guilty of perjury, so lying can produce an offense where

4

there was none before.
MR. MARTH:

5

The statute of limitations

That's what Congress has said.
Your Honor, but here Congress has

6

said that employees, when they're going to be disciplined,

7

have certain rights, and the issue is, are those rights to

8

a meaningful opportunity to defend affected when -- before

9

those rights are ever given, and here you have -- I think

10

it's important to understand the context.
For example, in Mr. Erickson's case, the initial

11

12

decision indicated that he was put into a room and

13

questioned and told to fill out certain answers to

14

questions.

15

asked to leave the interview room.

16

He asked for counsel.

He was denied it.
He was denied it.

He put down that he felt that he was under

17

duress and loss of his job if he responded, so what

18

meaningful opportunities does he have subsequently to

19

respond when he has been under all this pressure and

20

coercion early on to respond to the Government's

21

investigation?

QUESTION:

But even this case, how does it fit

Why wasn't what went on part of an

Why doesn't -- shouldn't we read what the

MR. MARTH:

Your Honor, that's the one point I

8

agree with General Waxman on.

I don't know how the court

9

of appeals could say that in light of these facts, unless

10

the court of appeals was saying, when you begin to focus

11

an investigation on a particular respondent similar to a

12

criminal context, certain rights attach.

QUESTION:

Well, but this seems to say just the

14

opposite.

16

It says, of course, when they -- during the

MR. MARTH:

Well, I mean, there's no question

17

that these questions were given during the investigation,

18

but what is evident is that the investigation had focused

19

on the individual respondents in this case.

20

For example, in Ms. Walsh's case, the

21

investigator came and said, we have talked to 10 people,

22

and we have statements showing that basically you've lied

23

to us, or that you are guilty of this misconduct, and you

2

So you're right, Your Honor, that the court of

3

appeals used that phrase about an investigation, and the

4

only way that I can reconcile that phrase is in terms of

5

the fact that the investigation had now focused to the

6

point on these respondents that they were in effect the

7

persons that were going to be put to the charges on.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Marth, can I -- let me express

what -- the trouble I have with your presentation.

You're

10

relying on the Due Process Clause which prevents the

11

deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due

12

process, and your claim here is that the property of this

13

job, this Federal job is unfairly taken away unless the

14

individual is allowed to make misstatements during the

15

administrative proceeding that would result in taking it

16

away.

17

MR. MARTH:

Not exactly, Your Honor.

In terms

18

of the administrative proceeding I'm not taking the

19

position that anyone at a Merit Systems Protection Board

20

hearing has a right to lie.

21

specifically to the contrary.

QUESTION:

MR. MARTH:

In fact, we're saying

about to say is important, and if you lie you are subject

to criminal liability, or the equivalent?

14

MR. MARTH:

I don't think the record is clear on

that, Your Honor, Justice Breyer.

16

the employees were not told anything about that.

17

QUESTION:

As far as I can tell,

I mean, what I -- the difference

between this case and Alger Hiss illustrates the point

19

that when a person commits perjury he is put under oath.

It is made clear to that person how important what he's

about to say is, and what will happen to him if he lies.

context of the law that we're arguing about, and if you

can find a way to do that, I would be interested.

MR. MARTH:

MR. MARTH:

1

Your Honors, we would contend that

2

the due process concerns in this case with regard to risk

3

of erroneous deprivation, basically that there are six

4

potential risks to the employees in these -- in this case.

5

First, there is the chilling effect stemming

6

from the seriousness of the charge, which we've already

7

talked about.
Secondly, an employee who is not represented

8

9

during this process risks being coerced when questioned.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Marth, may I just ask you one

11

question about the relationship of the prior

12

decisionmakers?

13

Federal Circuit's prior decision, or did it originate with

14

the MSPB?

Did the MSPB get this rule from the

MR. MARTH:

15

The Federal Circuit in Grubka came

16

up with the proposition to begin with that a person always

17

has the right to deny a charge and put the Government to

its proof.

QUESTION:

So it wasn't MSPB as -- MSPB was not

the originator.

That's correct.

lie a little bit of the way at the beginning so that he

would be able to make a more effective defense later on

without having given things away.

4

MR. MARTH:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. MARTH:

Well, Your Honor -Isn't that your theory?
Yes, Your Honor, but the risk comes

7

from requiring an employee at that early stage in effect

8

to give up or minimize his later meaningful rights.

9
10

QUESTION:

Yes, but it's not a risk of erroneous

deprivation.
MR. MARTH:

11

Well, if he is required to respond

12

with more than an exculpatory no in effect at that time,

13

then there is that risk that his later rights would be

14

deprived of him, deprived of him from a meaningful point

15

of view.

16

QUESTION:

Well, it's a risk that his later

17

rights will not protect him from a justified deprivation.

Isn't that it?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Mr. Marth may be simply have misunderstood or

17

not know what the facts are with respect to the other five

18

employees before this case, but he surely knows what the

1

facts are with respect to his client, Sergeant Erickson,

20

who was not put in a room and told he had to answer a

21

series of rapid-fire questions.

22

The record in this case reflects that Mr. --

23

that Sergeant Williamson at 7:20 in the morning signed a

24

Kalkind statement acknowledging that he has -- may be

25

asked to provide answers to questions:

13

asked a bunch of rapid-fire questions, it seems to me

14

we've got the same answer under --

15

GENERAL WAXMAN:

That's -- that's right.

He

16

could simply have said, I don't remember, or I'd like to

17

take time to think about it, or he could have confessed,

18

and that was the case with respect to all --

QUESTION:

Which is I suppose what he should

have done, right?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

We have as an -- the Government

as an employer has the right to ask that they do that,

even if we had been "unreasonable" and put him on the spot

and said, look, we're investigating this Mad Laugher

anything about that, but none of the cases before this

2

Court are anything approaching that.

3

Ms. Walsh, who supposedly was asked on the spot

4

to talk about events that happened 3 years before, was

5

accompanied by an attorney, made a long, discursive

6

statement in response to questions, and there was a

7

transcript.

8

It was a long time ago.

9

about a long relationship she had.

10

She could easily have said, I don't remember.
She gave a whole false story

You are right.

It does not matter as a

constitutional matter.

I just wanted the record to be

In fact, I don't suppose she could

even say I don't remember, if she really did.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

That's -- that's right, and the

6

problem that Justice Breyer was suggesting that some

7

people may have with the potential for abuse I think is

8

dealt with very adequately by Congress and by the Office

9

of Personnel Management in the relevant stat -- provisions

20

of the Civil Service Protection Act and the implementing

21

regulations.

22

In 5 U.S.C. section 230 , that is the statutory

23

provision that enunciates the merit systems principles, it

24

states, among other things, that as a matter of statutory

law all employees and applicants for employee -35

employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in

2

all instances of personnel management, and it goes on.

QUESTION:

Is this -- this is a minor -- but I

4

mean, it -- point, but it's crucial, I guess not

5

necessarily to whether you win or lose, but I'm still

6

worried about whether this is a constitutional or a

7

statutory case, and the language on 12a, you see, they

8

say, the question before us is whether doubling up a

9

misconduct charge, et cetera, deprives the employee of the

10

due process that the statute intends, and then they talk

11

about Federal law throughout the rest of it, and they've

12

got the Constitution in there quite a lot, but I -- maybe

13

it's the same answer.

14
15
16

I don't know.

But is this -- what do you think about that
language?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

There is simply no doubt that

the Federal Circuit was ruling as a matter of

constitutional due process.

It says so over and over and

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, you would not be happy, I

don't suppose, with a decision that says we find no

constitutional basis for this decision, but we leave open

23

the question whether it's commanded by the statute.

Well, that's -- you mean by the

court below?

Yes.
That's rather --

We've muscled that around before,

right?
(Laughter.)
GENERAL WAXMAN:

That's rather muscular.

We'll

take it, whatever this Court's judgment is.
The question presented is a constitutional one.

15

I think the reason that there's no statutory question in

16

this case is that there simply is no statutory provision

17

to which this claim could be attached.

18

QUESTION:

Well, he -- they've attached 7513 and

19

to the list in 7511 and they say, for the efficiency of

20

the service, and then they list all these rights and they

21

say, well, obviously, this means that you have a right to

22

say no, and certainly during the hearing, and since you

23

must have a right to exculpatory no during the hearing

24

itself you have this reading.

Yes, it's muscular.

1

It's -- look, it's not how --

2

it isn't how the Government has read the opinion, but it

3

would be wonderful if the Court could so read the opinion

4

and then hold that even as a matter of statutory-

5

construction it simply cannot be that as an a priori

6

matter it doesn't promote the efficiency of the service to

7

sanction employees who deliberately and intentionally lie

8

to their employers.

the Court feels that it could, we'd embrace it.
If there are no further questions, we'll submit.
