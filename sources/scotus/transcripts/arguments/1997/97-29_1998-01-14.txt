ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAVIER AGUILAR

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. AGUILAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The temporary appointment of a master or a

11

management team with limited powers to assist school

12

districts that are not achieving the academic goals set by

13

the State is not a change with respect to voting but,

14

rather, it is a temporary change with respect to

governance.

board.

More precisely, such an appointment does not

MR. AGUILAR:

So why are you here?

MR. AGUILAR:

Well, that they believed that --

Might be.
Might be.

Might be.
More appropriately stated.

So we

7

answered their questions, thinking that once we provided

8

them with answers to their questions, that they would

9

agree with us that in fact they were not election-related.

Well, that is not what happened, Justice Scalia.

They in essence precleared the provisions, and I'm talking

12

about as

15

QUESTION:

They're unwilling to say that none of

these -- none of these might not be?
MR. AGUILAR:

Their unwillingness -- well, I

16

guess what they're saying is that they believe, since they

17

precleared them as enabling legislation, that they -- once

18

we actually put them into effect in those situations when

19

we need them, to utilize them, that they will result in --

20

QUESTION:

Well, is that what it means?

I mean,

21

I interpret that to mean there is nothing in this enabling

22

legislation, in and of itself, that's bad, and we just

23

don't want to say right now whether, as it is later

24

implemented, something might be bad, which seems to me a

25

sober thing for the Justice Department to do.

MR. AGUILAR:

We would probably do the same thing,

I think the

Well, Mr. Aguilar, I share Justice

16

Scalia's concerns.

You want us to say that never, under

17

any circumstance, under any implementation, could this be

18

covered under section 5 of The Voting Rights Act.

MR. AGUILAR:

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

And it isn't even ripe.

It ha. n't

They could always file a suit after

I mean, I don't know why you're here.

6

MR. AGUILAR:

We're here, Your Honor, because we

7

believe that the statute as written, and as limited by

8

provision (e) on page 91a, in essence passes that bright

9

line test that this Court established in Presley.

QUESTION:

11

MR. AGUILAR:

12

Well -There is no way -- there's no --

I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.
QUESTION:

13

You began by reciting many of the

14

things the trustees can do.

15

trustees can do is to appoint other people to exercise all

16

of the power over the board of trustees under subsection

17

(9), as I understand it.

18

MR. AGUILAR:

QUESTION:

One of the things the

That is true.

The master can appoint a board of

20

managers composed of residents that exercises all tue

21

powers and duties of the board of trustees.

subdivision (9), is the one that can appoint a board of

managers, and we did not challenge provisions (9) and

that does not fall within section (5).

We are not here today suggesting that that is --

We have no quarrel

So you would submit to the Attorney

13

authority to select members of the school -- I mean,

14

citizens of the school district, residents of the school

district and appoint them as board of managers to replace

16

the elected board, and they'll have all the power of the

to a de facto replacement, but under no circumstance can

fact that that falls within section (5).
(9) I think falls within the caveat in Presley

about de facto replacement.

satisfies what this Court had in mind.

5

I think that probably

But (7) and (8), that is not a de facto

6

replacement, and that's the only thing we're talking about

7

possibly being a reason for it falling within section (5),

8

because the legislature has said in the limitations found

in subdivision (e) that there are certain things that the

setting of the tax rate, or the amount of money that the

The Texas courts

No, they have not, Your Honor.

So that just what the law does permit

the masters to do is really not clearly established.
MR. AGUILAR:

do is limited by the problem at hand and how they go about

solving it, the creativity of trying to solve that

problem, but that's not where we -- that's not the

18

exclusive of required debt service, from that previously

adopted by the board of trustees.

20

What I was trying to say was that we belie/e

21

that the statute, when reviewed, clearly shows that we're

22

not dealing with section 5 coverage regarding changes in

composition of the electorate, the creation or abolition

sole basis for the preclearance as enabling legislation

was the issue of de facto replacement.

3

It's our position that this statute clearly

4

shows that we can never even get to that point, that in

5

fact -QUESTION:

6

Mr. Aguilar, this is a rather novel

7

procedure as far as I know.

8

where a State or covered jurisdiction has sought to sort

9

of jump the gun this way by bringing a noncoverage claim

10

Has there been any other case

in the D.C. District Court?
MR. AGUILAR:

11

No, Your Honor, and I think

12

there's a good reason for that.

Prior to 1992, before

13

this Court established its bright line test between what

14

is a change with respect to voting and what is a change

15

with respect to governance, I don't think there really was

16

a good -- a good understanding -- anything that affected

17

voting in any way, I believe, is the way I would

18

characterize the pre-'92 law, would be covered by section

19

5.

20

I think the bright line test laid down by this

21

Court in Presley in '92 gave us the opportunity and gave

22

the legislature the opportunity to say, well, how can we

23

effect these provisions to make sure that they're utilized

24

quickly when necessary without having to go through the

25

preclearance route, because it's really not their

2

Mr. Aguilar, what -- this taking over

the operations of the board is sort of a -- in extremis

remedy.

It's the last step.
MR. AGUILAR:

(9) and (10) are the last steps,

yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well -- oh, I'm sorry.

You're right.

8

(9) and (10) are taking over, in your estimation.

What

9

the Government contends might in some circumstances be a

10

taking over, replacing the board with a director as to

11

certain issues, that only comes after other remedies have

12

tried and been failed, right?

MR. AGUILAR:

Basically the master -- the management team went

There's no other way that you can appoint a master, Your

2

Honor, under our scheme.

3

It was not a board of managers, and so it's (a)(7) that

deals with an appointment of a master.

5

QUESTION:

It certainly wasn't an (a)(9).

Could you, before you finish, explain

how you got into this Court?

6

7

As I read the statute it says, when a State -i

8

paraphrasing it, when a State enacts or administers a

9

measure that affects voting, then the State can go to the

10

special three-judge court and ask for a declaration that

11

it doesn't affect voting in a racially discriminatory way.

12

Well, you're saying this is a measure that

13

doesn't affect voting, so if you think it's a measure that

14

doesn't affect voting, how did you get into this Court?

15

How can you say to the Court, we invoke your jurisdiction

16

because we have a measure here that we think affects

17

voting, but we want you to say it doesn't affect voting.

18

MR. AGUILAR:

19

QUESTION:

20

21

Yes, Justice --

How do you get into the Court on that

kind of a theory?
MR. AGUILAR:

Let me explain.

We got into the

22

Court because we were precleared, if you will, against our

23

will, because we didn't think these measures,

24

were affecting voting.

25

(7) and (8),

The Attorney General basically told us that

We think that that -- that that legal
determination can be reviewed by a three-judge panel.
QUESTION:

Why?

I mean, why can't -- if you --

7

maybe you have some regular declaratory judgment action.

8

You can just go file -- I don't know if you do or not, but

9

I don't see how this -- how you get within this statute on

is

10

the theory that you don't affect voting.

11

the trouble that I'm having.

12

At least that's

I don't see why a State -- this seems to be a

statute set up for States that believe they have measures

14

that do affect voting, and they believe that those

15

measures are not discriminatory.

of an instance where a State has gotten a ruling from the

What we're trying -- if we can -- the logic is,

2

if we are entitled to bring an action in the district

court that raises both the predicate question and the

question of purpose and effect, then we believe that we

also have, under the logic of Allen, the right to bring

the coverage question only when we are in a situation

get preclearance by the Attorney General on an issue that

respect voting and those that do not, and we are

Well, we're also concerned

did apparently submit something to preclearance in the

We -- I personally phoned and asked for them to expedite

18

it, and in fact we got, on the sixtieth day, more

19

questions asked, and 30 days later we got a result.

20

The rundamental -- our fundamental position is

21

that when you apply Presley to this statute, to the words

22

of this statute, we -- we're of the opinion that it does

23

not fall within section 5, because it's certainly not

24

election-related, and it's certainly not the abolition or

25

creation of a -- of a office.

1

And finally, the only other thing it could be

2

would be a de facto replacement.

3

is, it can never be a de facto replacement, because the

4

State, in the provisions, has reserved enough, we believe,

5

authority to the school board members -- you see, the

6

school board continues to meet, continues to debate,

7

continues to vote on important items like tax rates, like

8

school bond elections, like the amount of money to be

9

spent on the school for the following years.

And what we're arguing

Those are

10

areas that our master or management team don't have any

11

authority for.
So it is right, from the perspective of we have

12

13

a statute that needs to be interpreted.

14

and the wrong to us is an incorrect determination by the

15

Attorney General that this falls within section 5, seen

16

through the prism of Presley, and the immediate impact on

17

us is that it's a federalism one mixed up with the fact

18

that there is delay in trying to get State processes that

19

our legislature, elected by the people, wanted to put in

place in order to strengthen our schools.

MR. WOLFSON:

I think our view is that the

that this case has to be resolved only within the

Well, in Allen -- in Allen --

In Allen the Court went into 1343.

MR. WOLFSON:

That's right, but again that

was -- I mean, at that time I think the Court did not view

12

actions against the States as raising the same sovereign

13

immunity concerns that -- as it might now or as it does

against suits against the United States.

15

for jurisdiction for this type of claim is section 5

itself, and that, for the reasons we give in our brief,

that's not -- we don't find it to fall within section 5.

QUESTION:

The only basis

No, but Mr. Wolfson, as I understand

19

it, even on your own argument, if they had gone into the

D.C. court and said, we want preclearance, it's quite true

21

we asked for preclearance from the Attorney General and we

got it only, as it were, 90 percent of the way, we're

Because you said, you know, if they

So I take it on your view, the court would have

had jurisdiction if they had simply approached it in that

particularly formal way.

I think if they were doing that

17

before the statute had ever been implemented, or before

there was ever any -- in a situation where there was no

QUESTION:

The only thing that they fail to do, on your theory, is to

precede their request for this declaration with a

statement in the form, please preclear this.
MR. WOLFSON:

9

I think -- well, I think that what

it reflects is that they didn't preclear it -- they didn't

10

ask for preclearance because -- and I can't speak for the

11

State, obviously, why they didn't request preclearance,

12

but that they knew that they weren't going to -- they knew

that it wasn't going to be done immediately, and so there

was nothing to pre -- there was no implementation of it to

I think that the appeal

I think that the perp that -- under that old

3

provision, the Court had to engage in this very elaborate

4

analysis about whether -- was the three-judge court

5

properly convened, because did they -- or did there have

6

to be a three-judge court, and then if the -- the end

7

result under that analysis was basically, if the three;*

8

judge district court ruled on any ground other than
striking down the State statute or upholding it on the

10

merits, then the case had to go back to the three-judge

11

district court, really, and then taken back up the court

12

of appeals.

13

I don't think section 5 provides for such an

14

elaborate provision.

15

section 5 is a factor that indicates that the Court can

16

resolve the cases that were brought up to it directly.

17

I do think that the expedition of

NAACP v. City of New York is the leading case on

18

this point, where in that case there was a motion to

intervene, I think in the -- I think it was in a

preclearance action in the District of Columbia District

21

Court, and the motion to intervene was denied.

That case was brought directly up to this Court,

case is similar.

General have any provision for taking immediate action to

2

allow partial implementation of a law like this pending

3

its decision on the preclearance request?

4

For example, where the bankruptcy proceeding has

5

been initiated and people are in the school district

6

trying to seize assets, and the kids can't go to school,

7

is there any provision for the Attorney General to come in
Ht

8

and say, well look, we're considering this, but right now

9

we're going to let you operate with the management team

10
11

pending our resolution?
MR. WOLFSON:

I'm not aware that the Attorney

12

General's guidelines have anything directly on that point.

13

I mean, we can preclear parts of things, of course, and so

14

if, for example, you know, there were a -- if the State

15

were planning to do two or three different things, say, in

16

several school districts, and there was an emergency in

17

one, and --we could preclear --we could do partial

18

preclearance, or we can say, we think that this provision

19

is precleared, but we need to look a little more closely

20

at another provision under which you are exercising

21

authority, so there is that possibility.

22

QUESTION:

It seems to me rather puzzling and

23

somewhat ironic that you are urging that the State of

and you say, well just go right ahead and take your

chances, but you can't go into the United States District

It seems to me that the Justice Department would

say, of course, go into the district court and we'll

7

answer this question yes or no as to whether or not

8

Presley and Etowah applies to a section 7 proceeding.

9

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, I mean, I think that if

10

there is -- if they're actually implementing it, then that

11

is by far the preferred procedure, to go into the three-

12

judge district court.

13

Congress set up, and -- but I don't think it's correct to

14

say that the State has no options.

15

That's the preferred procedure that

I mean, obviously we prefer that a preclearance

16

action be brought in the three-judge district court, or

17

that a submission be made to the Attorney General, but

18

just as the three -- but in all these situations, we can't

19

resolve all of these questions in advance, before some

20

actual implementation is proposed.

21

I mean, the -- certainly, for the reasons I've

22

explained the three-judge district court can't do that

23

because of Article III concerns, and the Attorney General

24

also -- although the Attorney General may be able to

25

preclear, and often does preclear enabling legislation,

1

the Attorney General often has to wait until some actual

implementation of that is proposed before review -- both

before reviewing that on the merits and also even making a

considered determination as to whether it would be a

Are you going to hit

MR. WOLFSON:

Yes.

I mean, I think in effect

12

the State has asked for an advisory opinion that if the

13

Commissioner of Education at some point decides to appoint

14

a master or a management team for a local school district,

15

then that appointment would not be a change affecting

16

voting, and I think it is significant that, as the State

17

has acknowledged, that it's their policy that when a

18

school district does have performance problems the

19

Commissioner tries to resolve those problems through less

20

intrusive sanctions, and we don't know that in the -- now

21

or in the imminent future the Commissioner will ever need

22

to go so far as to reach the sanctions under sections 7

QUESTION:

May I ask you one question that kind

of troubles me about the

-- your position?

The

10

question -- it seems to me the question of whether the

11

appointment of a management team or a master is -- affects

12

voting depends on what the management team or the master

13

does, exercising -- some of them -- it seems to me some of

14

the things they do clearly would not affect voting, others

15

would, so I'm not sure you're going to have the ripeness

16

the way you've described it until not only the management

17

team's been appointed but also there's some idea of what

18

the management team proposes to do that the school board

19

itself would not have done.

20

MR. WOLFSON:

I think -- well, one thing is that

21

under the Texas law when the Commissioner of Education

22

appoints a master or a management team he Is supposed to

23

delineate the powers of the master or the management team.

24

single thing that that master or management team might do,

might be exercised.

Right, but I think the -- I mean,
