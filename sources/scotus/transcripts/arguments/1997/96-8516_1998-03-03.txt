ORAL ARGUMENT OF L. MARSHALL SMITH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

This is an unusual case in that it may fairly be

12

said that this defendant is in prison for acts that do not

13

amount to a crime.

14

Bailey case made it clear that mere possession of weapons

15

near drugs does not amount to use under the Federal

16

statute under which Mr. Bousley was convicted.

This Court's unanimous opinion in the

17

It is at the core of habeas corpus jurisprudence

18

to release prisoners who are held without legal authority.

19

Mr. Bousley is in this position because at the time he

20

entered his guilty plea to the charge under 924(c) the

21

charges had been explained to him in language of

22

possession.

23

one cannot be convicted of this -- violating this statute

24

lest there's been proof of active employment.

25

However, the Bailey case makes it clear that

somewhat standard argument that the Rule 11 colloquy was

inadequate?

MR. SMITH:

wouldn't say that, Your Honor.

than that.

Your Honor,

Well,

it's not -- no,

I

There's much more to it

I take it that even pre-Bailey

7

you would have this same objection.

8

9

MR. SMITH:

You talk about

That's correct,

the argument would

10

be the same.

11

the colloquy but it's the entire presentation of the

12

nature of the charges to Mr. Bousley led him to believe

13

and,

14

possession crime,

17

caused the reflection that this was a mere
rather than an active employment crime.

As a result, his guilty plea cannot be construed

15
16

indeed,

The difficulty here is that it's not just

as
QUESTION:

Well, but then that goes to the next

18

argument that the law has changed in your view,

19

but if this were pre-Bailey,

20

the books, would you -- you would still say,

21

that the plea was inadequately counseled and that the

22

colloquy under Rule 11 was inadequate.

23

MR. SMITH:

I take it,

MR. SMITH:

3

for a guilty plea to be valid,

4

and it must be intelligent and when the crime is explained

5

as something other than what the statute actually

describes,

because the defendant is not aware and because the

8

presentation does not comply with the statute,

9

more than just a Rule 11 violation.

in order

it must be knowledgeable

the plea cannot be intelligent or knowing,

QUESTION:

10

That's correct, but again,

Well,

so it's

It's --

I think that's a conventional

11

argument and that the plea bargain and the fact that he

12

had the indictment,

13

agreement, did he not?

14

MR. SMITH:

15

QUESTION:

16

the plea -- he signed the plea

He did sign the plea agreement.
And that adequate -- and that sets

forth use.

MR. SMITH:

MR. SMITH:

No.

No, Your Honor.

It did not?
The plea agreement uses the word

That's correct, Your Honor, but

it's -- use is merely the label for the crime.

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

10
11

The critical element of the crime

Well, the statute doesn't talk about

active employment.

7

9

That's not

No, but it -So that the plea agreement, at least,

was in terms of the statute, as was the indictment, of
course.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, the

12

difficulty is, if a defendant is told the label for the

13

crime but not the elements, as in the Henderson and Morgan

14

case, it's not possible to appreciate what actually is

15

involved for a conviction and therefore the plea cannot be

16

knowing and intelligent.

17

QUESTION:

Well, may I ask you this.

When the

18

factual basis for the plea was stated, was that factual

19

basis couched in terms of use, active employment in the

20

sense that Bailey described, or was it couched in terms of

21

mere possession?

22

MR. SMITH:

It was couched in terms of

23

possession, Your Honor and the notion of active employment

24

was not referred to at all during this proceedings.

25

only reference was to possession as being the critical

The

1

element in this charge.
QUESTION:

2

And isn't it the case here that all

3

participants, the judge,

4

all of them in fact understood that the crime was

5

possession, availability of guns and not active use, and

6

that's what the judge explained to the defendant?

7

MR. SMITH:

the prosecutor and the defendant,

Yes, Your Honor,

that's correct.

8

That's what all participants thought.

It turns out that

9

that was incorrect, because, as the Court well knows,

10

section 924 requires proof of active employment rather

11

than mere possession.
QUESTION:

12

Now,

if he hadn't been told this, but

13

was --by the court but was advised to that effect by his

14

lawyer and had his own misimpression as to what the law

15

meant, would you have a solid case?
MR. SMITH:

16

I think that would be a much harder

17

case, Your Honor,

18

test,

19

whether under all of the circumstances there's been an

20

adequate explanation of the crucial elements of the charge

21

and, under your hypothetical,

22

defendant would not have had an adequate explanation even

23

in that situation.

than the one we have here.

However,

as reflected in the Henderson and Morgan case,

But you can't demand that the trial

of the crime that was the generally understood

description.

then you could invoke Rule 11 and say the court wasn't

doing its job.

He gave a description

MR. SMITH:

But here, the court did its best on

Well, Your Honor, I have to disagree

13

with the notion that this was the current law.

14

what the Eighth Circuit had described the law as.

15

However, when section 924(c) was enacted, the Bailey case

16

makes it clear that possession, mere possession was never

17

a crime and, in fact, to the extent that there is any such

18

thing, or ever was any such thing as possession of a

19

weapon near drugs, that's a --

20

QUESTION:

It was

But a decision by this Court, you

21

know, it is -- it speaks finally to what the law means,

22

but it doesn't simply change the legal world that existed

23

3 years before, where several courts of appeals may have

24

said exactly the opposite.

it does do is create a class of defendants who are in

2

prison for acts that Congress has never made into a crime,

4

Well, it seems to me that's an

important substantive argument.

I don't think it means

the plea is involuntary.

8

on the laws that exists at the time.

Voluntariness of the plea should

Then if you want to

say that the law has changed and he should be released
10

anyway because it's substantively retroactive, that's

11

another argument, but I don't think it invalidates the

12

plea.
MR. SMITH:

13

Well, I understand your point, Your

14

Honor, and I would say that in order to test the validity

15

of the plea, the appropriate standard ought to be what the

16

statute actually says.
QUESTION:

17

Once one departs --

May I interrupt?

Isn't the test what

18

the law was at the time, and in your view, what was the

1

law?
MR. SMITH:

20
21

what section

24(c) says.

QUESTION:

22

The law at the time, Your Honor, was

Yes.

The fact that the court of

23

appeals has misconstrued the law didn't make it the law,

24

does it?

25

MR. SMITH:

No, Your Honor.

The law has --

2

Didn't we squarely hold that in

Rivers?

3

MR. SMITH:

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

4

The law has always been, under section

5

possession does not violate that code section.
QUESTION:

6

24(c), that mere

So you wanted this district judge to

7

instruct in the Rule 11 colloquy contrary to the holding

8

of the court of appeals of the circuit in which he sits?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

10

Well -That's what you want these -- I guess

11

each district judge would have to just sit back and figure

12

out what he thinks the law is, never mind what his court

13

of appeals says.

14

MR. SMITH:

Actually, Your Honor, what we're

15

pointing out here is that in these unusual situations,

16

when a Bailey case happens -- and they don't happen very

17

often.

18

in doing a -- in explaining what the congressional intent

1

is and what the statute actually says.

20

Ordinarily the circuit courts are quite effective

QUESTION:

Well, they won't happen very often in

21

the future, because we will be very, very reluctant to set

22

aside a longstanding misinterpretation by the court of

23

appeals if the consequence is going to be that every

24

guilty plea rendered during that period is invalidated.

25

I mean, don't you see that as a risk for the

1

legal system?

2

to setting aside any longstanding misinterpretation by the

3

courts of appeals.

4

I certainly would give great second thought

MR. SMITH:

Certainly, Your Honor, if there had

5

been many of those, but the fact is there have not been

6

many.

This just doesn't happen very often.

7

QUESTION:

But we -- one of the reasons we grant

8

certiorari on a statutory question is there's a difference

9

of opinion among the courts of appeals, so many of the

10

criminal statutes we decide are here solely because one

11

court of appeals takes one position and another court of

12

appeals takes another, so it's not as if this is going to

13

be limited to the Bailey type situation.

14

MR. SMITH:

Well, except for this, Your Honor,

15

and this is an important distinction.

The thing that

16

makes Bailey different from other statutory construction

17

cases is, this is not just any construction of the

18

statute.

19

the statute, which is possession versus active employment.

This is the critical -- the critical element in

20

QUESTION:

Well now, most statutes have several

21

elements, you know.

You have a certain intent, a general

22

intent, mens rea -- now, the next lawyer who comes before

23

us for the city is going to say, well, it's the intent

24

that's the critical element.

25

one element is more critical than the other, can you?

You really can't say that

MR. SMITH:

1

Well, I -- no, Your Honor, I'm not

2

saying that one element is more critical than the other.

3

What I am saying, however, is that when the critical

4

element has been misapplied, as it was in this case -QUESTION:

5

Well, why do you say this -- this

6

particular element, possession, that sort of thing, is

7

critical, whereas there are other elements of the crime,

8

too, the intent with which you have to do it.
MR. SMITH:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SMITH:

12

Yes.

That's correct, Your Honor.

So they're all critical?
Well, I can't say whether they're

all critical until I would see them, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

13

Well, isn't it true that that would

14

be -- of every essential element -- imagine the case going

15

to trial.

16

you must find A, B, and C.

The judge charges the jury, in order to convict

17

MR. SMITH:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
So one is no

more or less important

19

than the other, but it's what the law calls an essential

20

element, something the jury must find.

21

MR. SMITH:

What makes up the crime when you put

22

them together, and I would distinguish this from the

23

situation where a court determines, for example, that an

24

affirmative defense might or might not be recognized.

25

Additionally, Your Honor -- and Justice Scalia,

1

to respond to your concern -- when cases such as this are

2

sought to be reopened at the district court level it's

3

not, certainly, an automatic situation where there would

4

be, the guilty plea would be set aside.

5

judge would have to take into account all of the facts, as

6

he's, or she is entitled to do under 2255, and

7

determine --

8

9

QUESTION:

The district

Well, if your rule is that the plea

is involuntary if he doesn't know all of the correct

10

elements, all of the correct definition of the elements of

11

the crime, then it seems to me the district judge doesn't

12

have much to do.

13

MR. SMITH:

14

QUESTION:

Well, except, Your Honor, what -So I hope we can get beyond this.

15

seems to me that the plea is clearly voluntary based on

16

the law at the time.

17

should be set aside in any event because the law has

18

changed, that's quite a different argument.

19

It

Now, if you want to say that it

And I might just point out, you did not raise

20

the involuntariness point as -- in your petition for

21

certiorari, did you?

22

MR. SMITH:

The invalidity of the plea on the

23

basis of the inaccurate description would, I believe, fit

24

within the second question, although it's not specifically

25

described there, so Your Honor is correct in that regard.

QUESTION:

2

MR. SMITH:

Now,

is he stuck with that waiver?

I would argue that he did not waive

it, but if it were determined that he did based on Your

4

Honor's position,

5

stuck with that for three important reasons.

I would argue that he should not be

6

First,

7

is what it's been labeled,

8

full circle and perhaps makes a somewhat perverse use of

9

the doctrine, because here's a defendant who's attempting

the notion of procedural default, which
in a sense this is bringing it

10

to establish his actual innocence,

11

front of him is a procedural bar that prevents him from

12

establishing that.

13

and what's placed in

When a defendant is in this situation where the

14

statute as interpreted now makes it clear that his conduct

15

simply did not violate the statute, the notion of default

16

should not be applied, and the notion of cause,

as that's

17

been found in this Court's prior jurisprudence,

certainly

18

should be found because of the string of Eighth Circuit

19

opinions which would have prevented Mr. Bousley from

20

knowing that he had the opportunity to bring this,

21

as what the trial court told him.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith,

as well

I think we often apply the

23

doctrine of procedural default when its consequence is to

24

exclude a claim of actual innocence.

25

at all unusual.

I mean, that's not

MR. SMITH:

1

With this case, however, it's

2

different, Your Honor, in that what we're speaking here

3

about is the critical element of the crime.

4

different.

5

That's what's

Those -- the cases that have been -QUESTION:

It's no different.

I mean, in some

6

cases -- let's assume a witness was improperly excluded by

7

the trial court and that witness would have shown the

8

nonexistence of one of the elements of the crime --

9
10

MR. SMITH:

That's -- that's --

QUESTION:

-- and you know, if it hasn't been

11

raised on appeal, and he says I'm innocent, and this

12

witness would have shown I'm innocent because one of the

13

crucial elements of the crime didn't exist, we would say,

14

well, you should have -- you know, we have a trial system

15

and you have to play by the rules.

16

MR. SMITH:

It's quite different, Your Honor,

17

however, when the actual element of the crime is one

18

that's never been enacted by Congress, and which forms the

19

QUESTION:

Because one of the elements that

Congress prescribed was not -- you know, he was not given

a chance to deny it.

4

MR. SMITH:

The difference, however, Your Honor,

5

is that as a matter of process and procedure here it's

6

clear that the district court was applying the improper

7

element from the very beginning and the explanation was

8

improper from the very beginning.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, but the defendant could have

10

taken the position, as many defendants all across the

11

country were doing at that time, that the statute meant

12

something else, and he could have preserved his right to

13

challenge that throughout.

14

I mean, that was happening all over the country,

15

but this defendant didn't do that and I think that leads

16

us to the question whether he should be held to the waiver

17

or the procedural default.

18

MR. SMITH:

I'd say two things.

There's an

19

important principle which is that, because this defendant

20

is actually innocent here of the charge, he ought not be

21

held to the waiver.

22

There's also a very practical problem with

23

taking the position that he should have raised this on

24

appeal when there was uniform Eighth Circuit precedent to

25

the contrary.

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The decision of this Court in Bailey,

7

interpreting the use element of the section 924(c)

8

offense, gives rise to a variety of fairly complicated

9

legal issues involving whether Bailey is a new rule under

20

the Teague decision, would affect the guilty plea the

21

petitioner entered -- has in this case, and whether

22

petitioner is a -- is subject to procedural default that

23

he must overcome in order to get collateral relief.

As the Chief Justice's question suggests,

if the

Government takes the position it has taken on the validity

of the plea agreement,

have to be applied not just in a case like this where the

6

circuits were at one time virtually uniformi, but in the

7

case of any circuit split you would have to invalidate all

8

of the plea agreements in that half of the circuit split

9

that ultimately loses, because the district judges in that

it seems to me that position will

10

half of the circuits will have been instructing the -- in

11

the Rule 11 colloquy according to the law of their

12

circuit, and would not all of those plea agreements be

13

invalid whenever it turns out that the element of the

14

crime in question is as the other circuits have said?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Scalia,

that has,

in fact,

16

been the practice that the lower courts have followed when

17

this Court has rendered a decision that cuts back on the

18

reach of a Federal criminal statute as compared to the

19

view that had prevailed in the lower courts.

20

QUESTION:

Let me put it this way.

Has it been

21

the practice of the district courts uniformly to say that

22

the guilty pleas were involuntary, which is the position

23

you surprisingly take in your brief?

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

That issue has not been litigated

in that fashion, Justice Kennedy,

so I can't say that

there are a huge number of cases that address it in one

MR. DREEBEN:

11

Well, by and large, Justice

12

Kennedy, the lower courts, when confronted with guilty

13

pleas that were entered under a serious misunderstanding

14

of the law, have left the defendant out of the plea

2

understanding of the law with the interests in finality

3

that we share with the courts.

4

Under section 924(c), we advocated for many

years a position that in essence permitted us to obtain

6

convictions based on a showing of possession of a firearm

near guns.

This Court unanimously that position.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. DREEBEN:

10
11
12

Near drugs.
Near drugs.

Near drugs.

Thank

you.
This Court unanimously rejected that position.
We were left with quite a few convictions that we had

obtained without ever proving the essential element of

4

active use and which guilty pleas have been entered with

5

the defendant never having conceded that element and the

6

question is, what happens to those convictions in which

7

the Government has not established and the courts have

8

never determined whether an essential element of the

9

offense was satisfied?

20

In our view,

the progression of analysis here

21

leads to the following conclusion.

22

Court in Bailey says what the statute always meant.

23

doesn't say what the statute meant from the date that this

Court decided it, and we're prepared to accept that

25

consequence, which means that, as to the convictions that

It

we obtained before, there is the possibility, although not

2

a certainty, that defendants may have either been pleaded

guilty or been convicted based on conduct that is not a

Well, that's one way to go, and

at the time.

MR. DREEBEN:

But the circuit law at the time

21

doesn't define what the crime is, and the premise of using

is that the individual has conceded that he is guilty of

I mean, the idea that there's some sort of an

delineated by this Court is -- really doesn't correspond

11

with reality in many senses.
Certainly, this Court is the final expositor of

12

13

the law, but there are all sorts of other courts in the

14

meantime that are handing down decisions saying what a

15

particular statute means, and the idea that when we say it

means this, that everything that happened in the past is

MR. DREEBEN:

means.

in Bailey, so that decision explained what the law was

But petitioner had the burden of bringing that

that the procedure of the law provides for him upon pain

The statutory claim -Well, that's not linked to the actual

MR. DREEBEN:

The first thing that any defendant

needs to show if they want to get in the door on 2255 is

6

either a constitutional claim or a statutory claim that is

7

violation?
MR. DREEBEN:

The constitutional claim is that

in order for a defendant to enter a valid guilty plea

which waives his privilege against compulsory self­

incrimination and his right to a jury trial, he must have

6

an adequate understanding of what elements of the offense

he's admitting to.

8

QUESTION:

So we go back to the very beginning.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

We go back to the premise that

20

when Congress enacts a statute that tells us what the

21

elements of the crime are, and if that defendant didn't

22

get any notice of that, his plea of guilty is not a

23

reliable basis for concluding that he is guilty.

B, and C, do you admit that you did these elements, and he

says

satisfies that, but the statute actually contains element

3

D, which is an element of his conduct that has never been

explained to him and that he does not admit doing, the

5

guilty plea does not represent a reliable determination

6

that he is, indeed, guilty of the offense.

7

yes, I do, judge, there's no question my conduct

QUESTION:

Well, another thing he says in the

8

guilty plea is that he wants to end the criminal process.

9

He wants to begin that necessary reconciliation to return

10

him to civilized society, and it seems to me that you are

11

very much undercutting the whole purpose of a guilty plea

12

by your argument and that your argument also requires such

13

an arcane and abstract course of reasoning that it seems

14

to cast doubt on the whole question of whether or not our

15

decision is retroactive at all to a final judgment.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I agree, Justice Kennedy,

17

that there are a number of fairly arcane questions that

18

are built into the analysis in a case like this because

19

this Court has enunciated a number of doctrines that

20

sharply limit and, we think, appropriately so the

21

availability of relief on habeas corpus.

22

And I am prepared to march through the various

23

doctrines and explain them, but I wanted to state at the

outset and at this point that our basic position is that

What has been the practice?

For example, when this Court

decided the McNalley case and said that the intangible

rights theory of good Government did not fall within the

20

mal fraud statute, there were a lot of defendants who had

21

been convicted, some under guilty pleas, some under trial,

22

as to whom the Government had never shown the kind of

23

fraud that this Court held was in the mail fraud statute.

back into court and attempt to make the case that they

were innocent under the interpretation of the statute that

2

this Court said was correct.

3

in the process of proving an intangible rights violation,

4

we most often did prove some injury to money or property

5

that this Court said was the proper definition of the mail

fraud statute.

7

QUESTION:

Most of them failed, because

I have no problem with the people who

8

were convicted protecting their innocence all along, had

9

the same rule been applied to all those who pleaded guilty

10

to the statute and in my view took their chances as to

11

what the proper meaning of the statute was.
MR. DREEBEN:

12

There are relatively few cases,

13

Justice Scalia, but I have not seen a single case in which

14

a court said because of your guilty plea you are barred

15

meaning changed and what you did is not a crime at the

either a guilty plea or a conviction after a trial and it

had never established the defendant's knowledge of the

law, as this Court said was required under Ratzlaf, we

4

didn't object to giving the defendant an opportunity to

get some form of relief if, indeed, he could establish

6

that he had a colorable claim of innocence.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, you've made out a

8

perfectly good case for saying that we ought to look at

9

the voluntariness of the plea in the light of the final

10

resolution of what the elements of the crime are, but

11

there is a case for looking at it the other way and saying

12

there is no constitutional violation if, at least under

3

the prevailing or the unobjected-to law at the time of the

4

plea, it was properly done.

5

What's the Government's -- what is your best

6

reason for saying we ought to look at it your way rather

7

than look at it the way that if it was okay at the time,

8

no constitutional violation?

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Souter, in most contexts

20

it is the law at the time of the plea that should govern

21

the analysis of the question, and that is because if you

22

look at a case like Brady, in which this Court basically

23

said then-existing law governs the validity of the plea,

24

the question that is being asked is, the defendant has

25

admitted his guilt of the substantive offense and now,

should we let him after the fact say, in hindsight I

2

miscalculated about what the law might have been, if I had

3

known what the law would be, I never would have admitted

4

my guilt.

5

And I think the law quite properly says, that's

6

not the kind of claim you can raise.

You must take your

7

chances with what the consequences of pleading guilty

8

might be, or whether you had a good suppression motion

9

that you forewent, but this case is different, because the

10

requirement for the valid admission of guilt that

11

justifies holding somebody in prison in the first place is

12

that he had an idea of what the crime was that he was

13

pleading guilty to, in other words, as this Court said in

14

Henderson v. Morgan, that he had true knowledge of the

15

charges that he was admitting.

16

This defendant knew that he was admitting

17

possession of a firearm near drugs and he was told that

18

that made him guilty of a criminal offense and he said, I

did that.

21

Those facts are correct.

I'm willing to take a

But in fact, that's not what the law meant, as

22

we now know from Bailey, was required to obtain a valid

23

admission of guilty, so Justice Souter, my distinction is

24

that the core basis for allowing a guilty plea rather than

25

a trial to establish guilt is that the defendant

acknowledges that this conduct either was or can be shown

2

to be satisfying of the elements of the offense under a

3

proper understanding.

4

If he lacks that proper understanding, his

5

admission of the crime is not a valid basis for holding

6

him in prison, and that is distinct from all of the other

7

considerations that he might have viewed in hindsight as

8

impugning whether he would have made that admission.
Here, he never really made it in the first place.

Now, he was told by his lawyer -- and it's in

the record.

Pages 133 to 143 of the appendix in this

6

Court show that there was a dialogue between this

7

defendant and his lawyer about the elements of this

8

particular gun charge and the lawyer said, I have told you

9

repeatedly that section 924(c) requires more than

10

possession, and the petitioner wrote back to his lawyer

and said, I feel so strongly I am not guilty of the use of

a firearm that there is a good chance I would not be

That's at page 138 and 139 of the

part of a plea bargain, the defendant -- the petitioner

decided not to do that.

And what did he get in return?

In addition to

22

the fact that the Government did not appeal on the amount

23

of drugs that were found he got the right to contest the

24

amount of drugs with which he was going to be charged, and

25

less than 1,000 grams, so instead of looking at a level 34

2

sentence, he started out with a base offense level of 30.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Walsh, you're explaining things

4

that went on behind the scenes, but the scene itself in

5

the courtroom was a judge asking the defendant, do you

6

know what you were charged with?

7

possession of a firearm.

Defendant answers,

8

Judge Murphy then says, okay, if -- the

9

indictment charges you with possessing the firearms during

10

a drug trafficking offense.
So in open court he is told by the judge -- he

pleads to something called possession of a firearm.

13

judge affirms that the charge is possessing a firearm.

14

MR. WALSH:

The

And at page 28 of the colloquy, Your

15

Honor, the defendant starts to quarrel with the court

16

about what access he actually had to these guns, and the

17

court explains, if you want a resolution of the gun issue

18

and its relation to the drug issue and whether you used

19

the gun, you have a right to ask for a jury determination

20

of that.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. WALSH:

23

Where did she say use the gun?
Well, she talked about the

relationship of the gun to the drugs.

25

was possession and proximity.

It's what

16

meant the difference between committing a crime and not

committing a crime in Bailey, and in slews of cases that

were backed up behind it, so it's

opinion, actively using the gun.

MR. WALSH:

That's correct.
All right.

Now, let me try a different hypothetical.

Let

me go part-way with your argument, and let me assume that

12

there certainly are some cases in which, if -- I'll take a

3

Holmesian view that the law changed when Bailey came down,

4

and I will assume for the sake of argument that there are

a class of cases in which we shouldn't disturb the plea

simply because the elements were explained improperly, as

7

understood by hindsight.

suppose there are -- you know, there are infinite

varieties of mistakes in the plea colloquys, but one broad

2

distinction would be this.

murder, that sort of thing.
In another class of cases, of which this is

3

supposedly one, there is no other offense, so that if he

4

pleads guilty to this kind of -- under these

5

circumstances, he's pleading guilty to something which

6

under no possible set of legal facts would be punishable.

7
8

Shouldn't a distinction be drawn between those
two kinds of plea cases, the argument being that in the
first class of cases the public has a -- at least an

10

interest in having murderers generally locked up, but

11

there is no discernible public interest, or no serious

12

public interest in locking up people for something which

13

is not a crime by anyone's definition, and for conduct

14

which does not fit within a crime by anybody's definition.

15

Would you admit that distinction?

16

MR. WALSH:

Well, no, Justice Souter.

him two extra levels on his sentence if he's found with

QUESTION:

So you're saying the Government -- I

So are you urging that we extend -- I

mean, you've been candid in saying we haven't -- we -that Teague itself uses the word procedural.
MR. WALSH:

Absolutely.

We think this case

12

should be subject to Teague and should be Teague-barred,

13

and it's a small step in our view from the cases that have

14

applied Teague so far to prisoners on death row, for

15

instance, denying them retroactive application of

16

constitutional provisions, to this case, which simply says

17

that a new statutory rule won't be applied retroactively.

18

But if I could talk for a minute about

19

procedural default, because not only did this petitioner

20

commit what we would call the ultimate act of procedural

21

default by pleading guilty, but then it was compounded by

22

his failure to appeal on the gun charge after he was

23

convicted, and the record again shows that he knew what

24

his rights were, but he waived them.

25

And as Justice O'Connor has indicated, there was

1

plenty of litigation going on around the country, and we

2

agree with the Government that there is no cause for his

3

failure to assert his gun rights on the original appeal.

4

It was not futile, and even perceived futility under Engle

5

v. Isaac and Smith v. Murray is not cause, so he

6

procedurally defaulted --

7

QUESTION:

Would you distinguish a case like --

8

post Lopez, suppose somebody -- direct appeal time is

9

over, applies under 2255 to be released because he was

10

convicted of the crime of carrying a gun within X distance

11

of a school?

12

MR. WALSH:

Well, I think as far as procedural

13

default is concerned I would have the same analysis there.

14

There might be other reasons why someone under that kind

15

of a situation might be --

16

QUESTION:

Well, do you distinguish these two

17

cases, or do you say they're saying too bad, you entered a

18

plea, even though the Supreme Court said that that's

19

not -- that can't -- not only it's not a crime, but can't

20

be a crime?

21

MR. WALSH:

Well, as far as if a statute is held

22

unconstitutional the Blackledge-Menna exception might --

23

might -- give that particular petitioner the right to set

24

aside the guilty plea, but that's -- Blackledge and Menna

25

don't apply to this situation.

QUESTION:

1

How do you deal with the argument

2

made by the Solicitor General's Office that if there --

3

there is, despite the waiver, a gateway for somebody who

4

comes in with a colorable claim of actual innocence?

5

MR. WALSH:

Well, that would be a novel

6

application of the doctrine of actual innocence, Justice

7

O'Connor.

8

applied actual innocence, the gateway or freestanding

9

actual innocence, to a situation in which a man pleaded

10
11

Never has this Court, first of all, ever

guilty.
But -- and the actual innocence paradigm that's

12

been created by this Court most recently in Schlup just

13

simply doesn't fit the situation where you have a plea of

14

guilty, because in that case, for instance, the

15

defendant --

16

QUESTION:

If this defendant had gone to trial

17

and been convicted, would you be here making this same

18

argument, or would you say under these circumstances that

19

person could come in with his claim of actual innocence?

20

MR. WALSH:

Well, he'd --

21

QUESTION:

No guilty plea.

22

MR. WALSH:

He went to trial.

He'd have a better claim, but still,

this isn't actual innocence at the bottom.

innocence means, I didn't do this.

innocence, as mentioned by this Court in one of its cases

is, they got the wrong man.

But what we're talking about here, at best, is

what the Court has described as legal innocence, or

technical innocence.

the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction,

whether obtained by a guilty plea or by jury verdict.

9

QUESTION:

What it really is is a claim that

Well, I think at bottom it's a little

10

more than that.

It was that this statute was

11

misinterpreted by the lower courts.

12

Mackey and in Desist confined the retroactivity to conduct

13

that could not be made a crime, flag-burning and so forth.

14

MR. WALSH:

15

QUESTION:

Justice Harlan in

Right.
Was the reason that he did that

16

because there was an extant body of jurisprudence or

17

understanding that statutory interpretations are not

18

retroactive to final judgments, or was this -- do you

19

think this was just the assumption of the law?

20

MR. WALSH:

I think he just felt that there were

21

certain primary personal rights that were so fundamental

22

that they're beyond the ability of Congress to proscribe.

23

QUESTION:

Neither side has a great case for us

24

on that, on the substantive point of retroactivity of

25

statutory reinterpretations.

some of the lower courts have
