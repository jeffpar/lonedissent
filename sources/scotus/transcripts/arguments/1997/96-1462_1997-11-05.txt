ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER H. LUNDING

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LUNDING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In calendar year 1990 I was a lawyer practicing

10
11

law in the City of New York and residing some 38 miles

12

from my office in the State of Connecticut, some 9,000

13

feet, plus or minus, over the State border.

14

something I did not think of when I moved to the State of

15

Connecticut that I would be here today on my on behalf,

16

challenging a statute of the State of New York as

17

discriminating against me as a nonresident in taxation.

QUESTION:

it is a

nonresidents be allowed to take deductions in proportion

2

that their New York income bears to their total income for

personal expense items.

4

It is not necessary to reach that point in this

5

case, and that's particularly because the nature of

6

alimony is very different from the nature of other

7

personal expense items in several respects.
In the first respect, in the State of

8

9

Connecticut, as well as in other States, the amount of

10

alimony is based, must be based upon the payor's total

11

income from all sources.

Couldn't you say, too, that you

couldn't afford a very nice house in Connecticut which

perhaps you have if you didn't make a good deal of money

in New York, and therefore that New York ought to allow

your property tax in Connecticut to be deducted?

That may be true, but it

Yes, but that would be true even --

supposing your divorce took place while you were getting

10

all your income in Connecticut, and then you later started

11

to practice in New York and had the same alimony, would

12

that make it a different case?

13

MR. LUNDING:

14

QUESTION:

Well, we --

You're relying on the fact that your

15

alimony is partially determined by your New York income,

16

but we'd have the same case before us if that were not the

17

fact.

18

MR. LUNDING:

Right.

I believe I must say that

19

that is correct, and it's because this statute has as its

20

unitary basis for discrimination nonresidents and no other

factor.

elements are extraneous.

they say we're not discriminating based solely on

MR. LUNDING:

QUESTION:

15

MR. LUNDING:

Well, let me --

Perhaps not.
Let me go back and state the

analysis here under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

The first element is, is this statute discriminatory

against nonresidents.

answer your question, but in a long way, if I may.

20

There's a two-prong test.

I will

The first test is to be satisfied is, is this

It has one sole, unique, intentional

That

The State of New York is unclear actually on

that point, but objectively we certainly assert that it's

satisfied.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Lunding, let me ask you about

that.

6

MR. LUNDING:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

Because I had always thought of

8

alimony as an income-splitting between the payor and the

9

ex-spouse.

10

MR. LUNDING:

11

QUESTION:

Correct.

Now, I could see, if you were

12

presenting us with a situation where what -- New York lets

13

you deduct the tax to your ex-spouse so that New York gets

14

the tax on that amount of money that you earned in New

15

York, but you would like to take the deduction while on

16

the income side, if there is any income, it is to the ex­

17

spouse, who is a Connecticut residence, so it seems to me

18

you say, let me take the sweet and New York will be stuck

19

with the bitter.

20

MR. LUNDING:

Well, I would not agree with that

21

conclusion, Your Honor, but I would point out this about

22

the nature of alimony.

23

deduction, and we -- we're talking about personal

24

deductions here.

25

The statute calls alimony a

Alimony is not really a deduction at all.

For

1

Federal purposes and for New York purposes it is an

2

adjustment to income, meaning it is -- and it is taken out

of the income of the payor,

the responsibility to pay tax transferred to the income of

the payee, or the recipient for tax purposes.

resident in New York that's the way it works, and that's

irrespective of where the recipient lives.

QUESTION:

MR. LUNDING:

11

QUESTION:

And in the Federal union that's fine,

because the IRS is going to get it either way.

But when you're in one State and

1

Immunities to say that when New York doesn't get the

2

chance to tax the one who's getting the money, getting the

3

alimony, it shouldn't have to give a deduction to the one

4

who's paying it?

5

MR. LUNDING:

Well, my point there was, if I had

6

been a resident of New York there would have been an

7

adjustment in which I would have been absolved entirely

8

for the tax on the alimony amount, and it would have been

9

transferred to my spouse.
Now, the New York statute doesn't require for

10
11

that operation for a resident that the spouse live in New

12

York.

13

the spouse did not live in New York there would be no tax

14

captured by New York on any part of that transferred

15

income, so this is really, I believe, a factor which is

16

not a motivating factor for New York, and if you look at

17

it in terms of the incidence of the tax as to residence,

18

it apparently is completely irrelevant in the economic

19

analysis.

20

The spouse could live anywhere in the world, and if

In the case of nonresidents, in any event the

21

residence of the recipient is also irrelevant.

22

statute doesn't say, which it could, if the recipient

23

lives in New York, and therefore we tax that money in New

24

York, we let you off the hook, Connecticut taxpayer.

25

hits everybody.

the standard is.

10

MR. LUNDING:

11

QUESTION:

Well --

Does New York have to treat residents

12

precisely the same as nonresidents in every category of

13

taxation?

14

MR. LUNDING:

Well, Austin v. New Hampshire

15

teaches us that New York has to treat nonresidents under a

16

rule of substantial equality of treatment, and --

17

QUESTION:

Can that substantial equality of

18

treatment be based on a theory that the income - - pardon

19

me, that the deduction or the adjustment must be related

20

to the income that's earned in New York, and income-

21

producing activities in New York?

MR. LUNDING:

As regards personal expenses, the

answer is no, because money being fungible, as a practical

There is a higher tax paid by

It is not insubstantial in this instance or in

5

any other, and it is much worse in the case of people with

6

proportionately greater New York-source income in

7

proportion to the whole, and therefore

8

New York may not, the petitioners urge, distinguish

9

between the two in the manner that this statute does.

10

QUESTION:

11

in New York, is that correct?

12

14

Now, you don't earn all your income

MR. LUNDING:

About half of it in my case, year-

That's right.

QUESTION:

New York but lives in Connecticut, strictly the bedroom

17

MR. LUNDING:

18

QUESTION:

19

There are many such people, yes.

As to that person, there would be a

very substantial difference, I suppose.

20

MR. LUNDING:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. LUNDING:

Well, the State has --

If alimony is not deductible.
Or - - well, it would be - - yes,

23

that is correct, and the amount of course, would vary

be paid by the nonresident in New York tax would be

2

greater than the amount that would be paid by a resident

3

of New York.

I mean,

4

to anything.

And this is another problem with the way

5

this statute does operate.

6
7

QUESTION:

in whole dollars, not in proportion

May I ask you a question just for my

own clarification?

8

MR. LUNDING:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

Is it correct that the rate that New

10

York imposes on the nonresident is based in part on the

11

nonresident's non-New York income?
MR. LUNDING:

12

That's correct.

The case that

13

allowed that is named Brady v. State, and they take into

14

account worldwide income in setting the rate, which is

15

progressive.

16
17

QUESTION:

Do you -- did you -- you didn't

challenge that feature of the tax in this case, did you?

18

MR. LUNDING:

No,

I did not, and I - - therefore

19

I don't have the standing to - - I have a view on it, but I

20

don't think it's appropriate necessarily to state it at

21

this time.

But you're --

25

MR. LUNDING:

Yes.

What is the top rate?
I don't really -- 9 percent,

I

1

believe, currently.

2

today, but it's 8 or 9 percent is the -- and I'm thinking

3

about 1990.

4

I don't -- I'm not sure what it is

I frankly don't remember.

But that's ball park, and it is progressive, and

5

they do tax -- they do take into account in setting the

6

rate worldwide income, and that could be another basis

7

upon which it could be said as a matter of the Privileges

8

and Immunities Clause that they also must allow some

9

proportion of worldwide deductions, whatever they may be,

10

or adjustments, because strictly speaking alimony is not a

11

deduction, not subject, for example, to the Federal limit

12

on deductions, but an income transfer, as Justice Ginsburg

13

pointed out.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

But an income transfer that can be

very beneficial.
MR. LUNDING:

Well, the actual effect in any

17

particular case will, of course, vary according to the

18

personal circumstances, where the receiving ex-spouse

19

lives and many other factors, but the effect of this

20

statute in all cases compared to the situation if the

21

statute were not there will be to discriminate against

22

nonresident taxpayers who pay alimony, because this

23

reduction in their income, taxable income, will obviously

24

discriminate.

25

QUESTION:

Well, when you say discriminate, you

mean treat differently, I take it.
MR. LUNDING:

2

Treat differently than residents

3

who pay alimony, yes, that's what I mean, and the amount

4

in this case is $3,724 for the year 1990 in my particular

5

case, or a 15-percent increase in the tax in my case.
QUESTION:

But you deduct if Connecticut has an

Which is the year in question.

The year in issue.

But ordinarily, if a State has an

13

income tax, the resident State, you could then deduct the

14

New York tax from the Connecticut tax.

15

see how much in practice is left when you take into

16

account, well, you have to pay New York more, but then you

17

got a bigger deduction in your home State.

18

MR. LUNDING:

I'm just trying to

Well, looking at the matter

19

currently, the tax rate in Connecticut is 4-1/2 percent.

20

The tax rate in New York is -- I don't remember, 8 or 9

21

percent.

22

Connecticut, and therefore there still is something left

23

over to be discriminatory on that regime, 4-1/2 percent,

24

whatever it is, the difference between the marginal rates

25

in the two States, but --

The deduction in Connecticut is at the rate in

QUESTION:

1

And in figuring the level of

2

discrimination, do we take account at all of the tax

3

that's being paid on these funds by the Connecticut

4

resident who's receiving them?
MR. LUNDING:

5

No, and that is because in Austin

6

v.

New Hampshire this Court held that the

7

constitutionality of one State statute that discriminates

8

against nonresidents may not be - - depend upon the present

9

configuration of the statutes of another State, which is

10

what we're talking about here as to the State of

11

Connecticut.

12

particular time cannot be the basis for holding

13

constitutional this discriminatory statute in the State of

14

New York.

15

What its tax laws may or may not be at any

QUESTION:

Are there some deductions or credits

16

that really are closely tied to the taxpayer's domestic

17

life as opposed to his or her business life?

18

MR. LUNDING:

Well,

there are commentators --

19

Professor Hellerstein in a 1974 article in the Michigan

20

Law Review seems to suggest a possible test in the

21

abstract that there would be some particular deductions

22

which are particularly tied to the particular

23

circumstances of the State of residence, without

24

identifying what they are.

25

QUESTION:

12

New York has a rule, which was stated in a case

called Martin v. Lavine, L-a-v-i-n-e, in 1976 and

elsewhere, including in the intermediate appellate court

15

in Brady v. State, that when a tax statute is challenged

in New York, generally speaking, you cannot have a

this started, you are prohibited from proceeding in a

representative capacity.

3

which involved the question of considering worldwide

4

income and setting the progressive rate in New York, it

5

was brought as a class action, and it was stopped as a

6

class action because of this rule, and the rule is based

7

on the theory as to the Government that an individual who

would win a case on the constitutionality of a statute

gives the benefit to all others by way of stare decisis,

State taxes which impact nonresidents, and the

petitioners' view of the matter is that in this instance

there is a lack of equality.

And therefore, if we were to adopt

to the extent that New York allows the same deduction for

MR. LUNDING:

It can certainly make the

decision not to allow it to its own residents and it need

not give it to nonresidents, and that's true whether it's

QUESTION:

1

Well, I thought our test was

2

something along the following lines, that a statute that

3

discriminates against nonresidents must be justified by a

4

substantial reason for the discrimination against the

5

nonresidents, beyond the mere fact that they're citizens

6

of another State.

7

offered by New York here, and is it substantial?
MR. LUNDING:

8

9

What do you think the reason is that's

Well, there are two reasons.

One

is that there exists untaxed income, meaning they can't

10

reach it because of the Due Process Clause under Shaffer

11

v. Carter, and for that reason they're free to

12

discriminate as they please, which is their actual

13

position as regards personal deductions, adjustments, or

14

whatever.

15

That part of the position is foreclosed by

16

Travis v. Yale & Towne, which says because the statute

17

does not condition its discrimination on the existence of

18

untaxed income, whether that exists or not is irrelevant

19

to the constitutionality of the statute on its face, so

20

that reason number 1, Travis takes out.

21

The only other reason that -- well, my colleague

22

will speak for himself, but the only other reason that I

23

foresee here is the lack of connection argument which

we've been talking about for most of this oral argument,

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is really whether New

York is required by the Privileges and Immunities Clause

14

to afford nonresidents an alimony deduction because it

15

affords the same alimony deduction to residents.

York's view, New York is not so required because the basis

17

upon which New York taxes residents and nonresidents is

18

completely different.

19

In New

New York's taxation of residents is based on the

20

fact that they reside within New York, residence giving

21

New York plenary jurisdiction over their income from every

source worldwide.

It is true that in the case of the

4

however large they may be in relationship to the total

income, which have no relat -- which are not incurred to

produce or to generate that in-State income, are simply

7

not something that New York is required to take into

QUESTION:

Why?

You don't do that for New

Yorkers.

You allow New Yorkers to do that stuff.

It is

11

not incurred in the generation of the New York income.

12

You give them all sorts of personal deductions.

MR. BING:

But again --

14

QUESTION:

What justification is there for not

15

allowing the same treatment to the out-of-Staters?

16

MR. BING:

In the context of the New York

17

resident, again we are looking not only at the New York

18

resident's New York income but the New York resident's

19

worldwide income, and so the New York resident as a

20

general matter is someone who will generally be subject to

21

a burden of taxation which is greater than that of an

22

individual in petitioner's situation.

all his income for purposes of taxes, you're entitled to

2

give him all deductions of any sort, but these people,

3

since they're out - of - Staters and you're not looking at all

4

of their income, except as to the rate, and therefore you

5

don't have to give them all of the deductions.

6

there's a certain parallelism there.

7

MR. BING:

I guess

That is correct, Justice Scalia.

8

Residence also affords the State an opportunity to take

9

into account certain personal activities of its residents

10

that it is not in our view required to take into account

11

for purposes of nonresidents, and under the Privileges and

12

Immunities Clause absolute equality of treatment has never

13

been the hallmark.

14

QUESTION:

But absolute equality of treatment,

I

15

found it awfully easy to construct bizarre examples.

16

is,

17

of New York, and $50,000 alimony, and all you have to do

18

is, you multiply by 4 percent, and that person is paying,

19

what, 4 percent times 50,000 I guess is $2,000, and then

20

apply your formula, and your formula will be $100,000,

21

total income, over Federal, minus the alimony, which will

22

be 50, so you get a multiple of 2, and so you have the New

23

York person paying 2,000, the Connecticut person paying

24

4,000.

25

1

and his income went down to where it was close to the

2

judicial decree for alimony, suppose he had 100,000, his

3

alimony was 90, you're going to get results that are going

4

to be phenomenal.

5

I mean, what will happen is the New York person

6

on $1,000 will pay -- let's say, if it's 10 percent, they

7

pay 1,000.

8

and you would discover that the Connecticut resident has a

9

$10,000 tax in New York, or if it's 8 percent, $8,000, and

10

You'd have to multiply by a multiple of 10,

his real income is 10,000.
Am I wrong in those?

11

I mean, I just -- all I

12

did was apply the formula, you know.

13

It says, he has $100,000, he has 90,000 alimony.

14

York purposes, he has $10,000 income.

15

8 percent, or 10 percent.

16

I took the formula.
For New

He pays, let's say,

That's $1,000.

Then it says you're supposed to take the New

17

York total, which is $100,000, right, and then you have in

18

the -- that's the denominator, his Federal, but not

19

counting alimony, so that's 10.

20

So 100 is 10 X 10, so you multiply 10 times the

21

New York tax, and you discover you've got $10,000 in tax.

22

Wow.

23

I mean, I could create, you know, worse ones, or

24

I suppose there are a lot of better ones, but it seemed to

me that it was pretty easy to create odd examples, and -35

which seem very unfair.
Now, am I wrong about the ease of doing that, or

3

is there some justification for that, or is it just

bizarre that a person would have, say, half his income in

alimony and yet all of his income out of New York, or that

he could have a bad year, or what?

MR. BING:

Your mathematics are entirely

correct, and your application of the formula are correct.
The justification for it that New York has offered is, I

10

guess, twofold.

11

the result that is contemplated by this Court's decision

in Shaffer and by this Court's decisions in the portion of

the same personal exemption, but what is the part that you

18

were relying on?

MR. BING:

I know what they held about

The taxpayer in Travis also

20

specifically challenged a provision of the New York --

21

then New York tax laws, section 360, subdivision 11, which

22

permitted nonresidents the deductions available to

23

residents only if and to the extent connected with New

provision in its brief in this Court arguing that it

worked in New York the deduction for his real property-

taxes while at the same time allowing the New York

resident a deduction for the real property taxes on the

QUESTION:

Was it hypothetical, or was there

something in the case, that this taxpayer said, I want a

deduction for my real property tax or my life insurance

of that case and because of who the taxpayer was that

14

being challenged by the employer rather than by any

particular taxpayer who was pointing to him or herself and

2

the case of nonresidents to those expenses that are

3

connected with the New York income, as settled by the

4

Shaffer case.

5

I think they were referring to that particular

6

contention of the taxpayer in the Travis case, and

7

subsequent to Travis, this Court has repeatedly in summary

8

dismissals in effect permitted States to recognize that

9

the difference in tax treatment which is mandated by the

10

Constitution, the fact that we can only reach the

11

nonresident's State-source income, permits, justifies a

12

State treating personal deductions differently in the case

13

of nonresidents.

14

QUESTION:

You say personal deductions, so I

15

gather that you are making the distinction between

16

expenses for the production of income and personal

17

expenses, and you are not relying to any extent on the

peculiarity of alimony, that it is a two-way thing, one

19

gets a deduction, the other gets income.

MR. BING:

The second one is simply, again, the

concept that New York can do for its residents things that

11

it is not obligated to do for nonresidents, and that --

12

again, the Privileges and Immunities Clause and other

13

provisions of the Constitution have been allowed -- have

been construed to permit certain beneficial residence

1

deductions, personal deductions, and then they changed.

2

What prompted the change?

3

MR. BING:

Well, the treatment of marital income

4

generally was addressed in '87, and at that time New York

5

abolished the filing-separately-on-the-same-return status

6

that married people had previously enjoyed and went to

7

more or less full income-splitting for the first time,

8

which is premised on the assumption that spouses share

9

total marital income equally.

10

Again, that was the assumption underlying

11

treatment of people who are still married to each other,

12

and because alimony, as you pointed out, is a tax-

13

shifting device rather than a true deduction, the

14

treatment of alimony with respect to nonresidents was

15

designed to bring it into congruence with the treatment of

16

income-splitting for people who are still together, still

17

married to each other.

18

QUESTION:

But there's the countervailing

19

consideration, isn't there, in the fact pointed out by

20

your brother that alimony is characteristically assessed

21

on the basis of total income, and therefore there is a

22

very strong relationship between the amount of alimony

ordered and income earned in New York.

if a taxpayer living in Connecticut had a second home on

it does not relate to the production of the New York-

you deduct that.

We'll tax you on your net income, but

9

we're not going to let you take into account either losses

10

or deductions arising from expenses in out-of-State

11

businesses over which we have no jurisdiction, and we're

12

also not going to take into account personal expenses that

13

you may incur in your personal life in some other

14

jurisdiction, even though with respect to people who

15

reside in New York we will allow them.

16

New York has believed and continues to believe

17

that that is a substantial justification and a legitimate

18

reason for what New York has done in this case.

QUESTION:

Why aren't those personal expenses --

I mean, if 20 percent of your income is from New York, why

21

isn't 20 percent of those personal expenses fairly

22

attributable to New York income?

24

come from non-New York State income.

MR. BING:

1

Again, we're not saying that the

2

contention is -- is being argued for in terms of this

3

would be a reasonable approach is not true.

4

saying it's an unreasonable approach, but we are saying

5

that we don't think the Privileges and Immunities

Clause --

We're not

7

QUESTION:

Requires --

8

MR. BING:

-- requires that absolute equality,

9
10

or at least that percentage equality of treatment.
And again, these expense actions have nothing to

11

do with where Mr. Lunding earned his income, and there

12

really is no principle basis, other than just saying,

13

well, 20 percent of the income, 20 percent of the

14

deductions, for looking at what happened in Connecticut.

15

There's no reason for us to say well, it could

16

be 20, but it could be more than 20.

17

with respect to his medical expenses he's entitled to more

18

than that because it was really primarily related to his

19

getting back and forth to New York and dealing with the

20

rush-hour traffic.

21

We could say that

I mean, there's no principled reason, no

22

constitutional principled requirement for New York to be

23

forced under the Privileges and Immunities Clause to adopt

24

a rateable approach, even though, as I said, that is one

25

that New York has followed in the past.

Can I just give you one hypothetical

comment on it?

resident and a New York resident, both of whom make

exactly the same amount of money, both of whom derive all

of their income from New York -- they're commuters.

Supposing you've got a Connecticut

One of them is a commuter and one lives in the

city, and one of them, the one who lives in Connecticut,

donates a substantial amount of money to the law school in

New York and wants a charitable deduction.

18

MR. BING:

In computing the New York-source

19

income portion of the equation, that's correct, but in

20

computing the tax as if a resident, which is the number by

21

which the fraction is multiplied, you do treat the

nonresident as if the nonresident were a resident, so that

QUESTION:

Would they be taxed the same in my

hypothetical as -- would the bottom line be the same?
MR. BING:

I believe that the -- obviously

6

the -- when you computed the New York -- the taxes if a

7

resident, on the part of the New York resident, then

8

obviously you'd stop, because that would be the answer.

9

The percentage of that that would be paid by the

10

nonresident wouldn't be affected by the formula, by the

11

fraction, which is the other thing, because New York-

12

source income is a net number without any reduction for --

13

itemized deduction such as the charitable contribution.

14

QUESTION:

I thought, to oversimplify it, that

15

the New York resident would get the deduction and the

16

Connecticut resident would not, in my hypothetical.

17

MR. BING:

In looking at the New York fraction,

18

Justice Stevens, there's no difference in the New York-

19

source income number -- there would be no deduction in

20

computing New York-source income for the charitable

21

contribution.

22

QUESTION:

That's not a constitutional point, so

23

any constitutional holding that permitted you to do what

24

you've done here would permit Justice Stevens'

25

hypothetical.

QUESTION:

And that's what's worrying me.

12

Of course, if it's constitutionally permissible

13

to do this, the States that are always anxious to get more

14

money could think of, you know, dozens and dozens of ways

15

to produce the kinds of results that we were talking

about.

17

MR. BING:

It's true that I believe our argument

18

would permit -- it doesn't work in New York's particular

19

methodology, but our argument is based on the legitimacy

20

of permitting States to focus solely on the economic

activity within the State and not to look at the

MR. BING:

In fact, as to New York State, that

is a permissible -- in our view, that's all right.

That's

a distinction that we seek to draw.
It's a distinction that New York and other

11
12

States have always, at least since 1920, thought that they

13

had the power to draw, and it's a reasonable distinction

14

based on the fact that we argue that we should not be

required to take into account the fact that yes, Mr.

Lunding does have a personal life, but it's a personal

life that is related to Connecticut, not related to any of
