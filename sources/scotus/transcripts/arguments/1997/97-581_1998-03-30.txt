ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL FISHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

GENERAL FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case is about Pennsylvania's ability to

12

properly supervise the 21,000 prisoners who have been

13

released from jail into the community on parole.

14

case, Keith Scott, the respondent, was a convicted

15

murderer given a 20-year prison sentence and was released

16

on parole in his eleventh -- during his eleventh year.

In this

17

That release was subject to a number of

18

conditions, among them that he not possess or use

19

firearms, that he not possess or use drugs or alcohol,

20

that he reside in an approved residence, and the condition

21

most important for the consideration of this case was a

22

requirement that he consent to a search of his person.

23

QUESTION:

Now, let me ask you a question or

24

two, if I may, General Fisher.

I take it the Pennsylvania

25

courts have determined that the consent provision that was

signed simply did not go beyond consent to search without

2

a warrant and determined that that did not mean that

3

consent was given to a search without reasonable

4

suspicion.

I take it that's the thrust of what the courts

6

GENERAL FISHER:

7

QUESTION:

8

That's correct.

And presumably Pennsylvania can

redraft its consent form to cover that, I suppose.
GENERAL FISHER:

Justice O'Connor, Pennsylvania

10

supreme court interpreted the consent provision to mean

11

that, in this case, that Scott agreed to reasonable

12

searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and

13

to be reasonable the Pennsylvania supreme court said that

14

the search required reasonable suspicion.

15

issue with which we are --

16

QUESTION:

That is the

Well, I -- to get back to my

17

question, I take it they just said that this form that was

18

signed didn't cover the issue of reasonable suspicion,

1

that all it covered was whether it could be without a

20

warrant, and in the absence of a consent, then, they said

21

reasonable suspicion is still required.

22

GENERAL FISHER:

They said that the -- their

23

interpretation was that -- their reading of the Fourth

24

Amendment was that the -- that Scott consented to a

25

reasonable search, and that a reasonable search required

reasonable suspicion.
QUESTION:

We believe -I'm not sure you're right in saying

3

that the Pennsylvania supreme court based its

4

interpretation of the consent form on its reading of the

5

Fourth Amendment.

6

on an interpretation of Pennsylvania law.

7

I thought they might have just based it

GENERAL FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, we argue

8

very strongly that they did, in fact, interpret it based

9

on their reading of the Fourth Amendment, and that is

10

where we disagree.

11

parolee's residence may be without suspicion, or a

12

suspicionless search.

13

QUESTION:

We believe that a search of a

Well, you -- suppose this consent

14

form were redrafted to make clear that the person paroled

15

is consenting to a search without a warrant and to a

16

search without any suspicion whatever.

17

drafted that way.

18

courts would say to that?

19

GENERAL FISHER:

Suppose it were

Now, what do you think the Pennsylvania

It's -- we believe that the

20

Pennsylvania courts would say, based on what they said in

21

this case, that we could not have that kind of consent

22

form, because we believe they have --

23

QUESTION:

24

GENERAL FISHER:

25

-- the Fourth Amendment?
Because the Fourth Amendment

requires reasonable suspicion.

QUESTION:

It just wasn't clear to me whether

2

that's what they said, because they could have meant the

3

consent form just didn't cover it.

No, Justice O'Connor, we think

they said very clearly that the Fourth Amendment requires

reasonable suspicion.

They said it both in the

Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and

because Williams relied on the Arkansas Williams case,

I think it's really hard to get

GENERAL FISHER:

6

Well, we argue, Justice

7

Stevens,

that the issue before this Court is whether or

of the Fourth Amendment gives parole boards and parole

10

agents such as ours the right to conduct these searches

1

QUESTION:

2

GENERAL FISHER:

3
4

-- if it doesn't apply?
-- and Justice O'Connor, I

think that there are two separate questions here.
We believe, as we have argued, that you do not --

5

that you -- that parole agents in our State can conduct

6

suspicionless searches of parolees, but in the event this

7

Court does not agree with our opinion on that, we believe

8

very clearly that the exclusionary rule should not apply.

9

In fact, the Court has always recognized that the

10

exclusionary rule imposes substantial costs on society, as

11

it withholds trustworthy evidence and impedes the search

12

for the truth and, in fact, this Court has never extended

13

the exclusionary rule beyond criminal trials or criminal

14

appeals, and there --we think that the -- in fact the

15

Court has ruled that the exclusionary rule is not

16

applicable to civil proceedings, that the exclusionary

17

rule is not applicable to grand jury proceedings, nor is

18

it applicable to civil deportation proceedings.

19

The exclusionary rule -- parole revocation

20

proceedings are informal, flexible administrative

21

proceedings, as a contrast to a formal criminal trial.

22

That is why we believe this Court has never extended other

23

rights, such as the right to counsel, the right to a jury

24

trial, the right to confront witnesses, or the right to

25

object to hearsay testimony.

QUESTION:

1

One of our concerns with the

2

exclusionary rule in the case of police investigations of

3

crime is that the police have an interest in trying to get

4

a conviction.

5

that parole officers have an equivalent interest in

6

showing that there's been a violation of parole, or is the

7

dynamic, the incentive, the motivation of the parole

8

officer somehow different than the police officer?

Will the respondents tell us in this case

GENERAL FISHER:

We think the motives, and we

10

think the role of parole agents is different than police

11

officers.

12

So the police officer's primary job is to

13

investigate crime, make cases, get convictions, which has

14

been recognized in cases by this Court, but parole

15

officers, their job is a two-part role.

16

the community from people like Scott, convicted murderers

17

who have been put back in the community, but also to

18

rehabilitate the individual.

Parole officers who returned all of their
parolees to jail would be failures, so we think that -QUESTION:

But you don't think the police

22

officer wants to put somebody in jail unless he thinks

23

he's guilty, do you?

24
25

GENERAL FISHER:

Certainly he wouldn't, but

still there's a different standard, and I believe that

1

this Court has recognized that the principal role of a

2

police officer is to enforce the law, to carry out the

3

law, but the parole agent's job is significantly different

4

from a police officer.

5

QUESTION:

Yes, but doesn't the parole agent

6

have a slightly different motivation in this respect.

7

the parolee whom he is supervising goes berserk, or just

8

returns to criminal activity, the -- you know, the outcry

9

is going to be, where was the parole supervision?

10
11

If

Why

didn't they catch this?
Isn't there therefore a sort of built-in

12

motivation on the part of a parole officer to be very

13

cautious, to be careful, and to be looking for signs of

14

trouble, which puts him pretty much in the same position

15

that the police officer is in in looking for signs of

16

trouble, and taking action to cover himself as well as to

17

protect the community if he sees signs of risk?

18

GENERAL FISHER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Certainly the

19

parole officer has a dual role.

20

have to be concerned about the community.

21

like Scott, convicted murderers, are placed back in that

22

community they obviously have a responsibility to try to

23

protect the community, but just as important to that

24

parole officer is rehabilitation.

QUESTION:

Well, he wants to rehabilitate those

3

who are not violating conditions, but I -- it seems to me

4

he has just as much motivation to recommit those who are

5

violating conditions as the police officer does to arrest

6

and see to the conviction of somebody who is violating a

7

statute in the street.

8

9

GENERAL FISHER:

But so, too, we think that the

difference between a formal criminal trial and of

10

revocation proceeding is important in looking at the

11

question of the exclusionary rule.

12

One who stands trial stands before that Court

13

cloaked with the presumption of innocence.

14

here when you're dealing with a convicted murderer who is

15

out on parole is someone who has been convicted, so that I

16

think that the important thing for the parole --

17

QUESTION:

What you have

Which means that the significance of

18

illegally seized evidence is more damning in the parole

19

case than it is, perhaps, in the trial case.

20

GENERAL FISHER:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

I don't --

Because as you say, there's no such

presumption that the evidence has to overcome.
GENERAL FISHER:

But the issue before the parole

24

board at a revocation proceeding is whether or not in fact

25

the parolee has conducted himself pursuant to the
11

1

conditions upon which he was released, and I think the

2

parole board has the right to know all of the reliable

3

evidence which if, in fact, the exclusionary rule were

4

applied would deny that

5

QUESTION:

General Fisher, are other rules of

6

evidence relaxed or foregone in a parole revocation

7

hearing as compared with a criminal trial?

8

9

I mean, here you're asking -- we're discussing a
rule of evidence that applies sometimes in criminal

10

proceedings.

11

evidence different in parole hearings?

12

In what other respects, if any, are rules of

GENERAL FISHER:

Well, yes, Your Honor, the

13

rules of evidence are relaxed in parole revocation

14

proceedings.

15

readily admitted in parole revocation proceedings.

16

is a -- it's an informal process.

17

For instance, the -- hearsay evidence is
There

Normally, the case for the parole board would be

18

presented by a parole agent, not an attorney, not an

19

attorney representing the parole board, but a parole agent

20

who would give his version of the facts, his version of

21

what the parolee has done while out on parole, and there's

22

a vastly different give-and-take in the process of the

23

parole hearing.

24

For instance, parolees generally testify, give

25

testimony as to what they have done, and so it is a very

1

informal, flexible proceeding, and that is why I believe

2

it is important for a parole board to be able to get the

3

benefit of all relevant evidence which goes to the

4

question of whether or not that parolee should be allowed

5

to stay in the community subject to the conditions or to

6

be turned -- to be sent back to jail, so that's why we

7

would ask that the exclusionary rule not be extended to

8

parole revocation proceedings.

9
10
11
12

I would like to get back to the issue involving
the validity of the search.
QUESTION:

In respect to that, could I ask you,

the part that I found most difficult in respect to the

3

question Justice O'Connor asked is on page 9a, in talking

4

about the question of consent, the court cites a -- an

5

earlier case and says that there, I guess, if I'm reading

6

it correctly, we concluded that the parolee's signing of a

7

parole agreement giving the officer permission to conduct

8

a warrantless search does not mean -- and here they say

9

two things.

20

And the first, it's either-or, and the either

21

says, either that the parole officer can conduct a search

22

at any time and for any reason, i.e., it does not consent

23

to random searches, or that he relinquish his Fourth

24

Amendment rights, so it sounds because of that either-or

25

that the Court in Pennsylvania is holding that this

1

consent is not a consent to random searches, and if that

2

is so, how could we reach the issue of whether it is

3

constitutionally permissible for a State to do what you

4

want to do, which is to conduct random searches?

5

GENERAL FISHER:

Justice Breyer, in the court's

6

opinion in the Scott case, from which you read, we believe

7

that a full reading of that opinion, and particularly

8

their holding, makes it clear that they were interpreting
what they believed to be a reasonable search, which was

10
11

that a reasonable search required reasonable suspicion.
That goes back to the Williams case, but an

12

analysis of the Williams case, Williams -- Commonwealth v.

13

Williams in Pennsylvania, as opposed to the other case

14

which Justice Stevens referred to, an analysis of that

15

Williams case goes in quite at length as an analysis of

16

what is required under both the Fourth Amendment of the

17

United States Constitution and what is required under

18

article I, section 8 of the Pennsylvania constitution, and

1

we believe very strongly that the Court couched their

20

opinion in both Williams and in Scott on what they

21

interpreted the requirements of the Fourth Amendment to

22

do, and that is where we disagree.

23

QUESTION:

So in your view if Pennsylvania

24

corrections officials recast this consent and said, I

25

consent to the search not only without a warrant but

1

without reasonable suspicion, the supreme court of

2

Pennsylvania would say, under the Fourth Amendment you

3

can't do that?
GENERAL FISHER:

4

That is correct, Mr. Chief

5

Justice, and that is where we find the major disagreement,

6

and we think that the suspicionless search which we

7

believe is permissible under the Fourth Amendment dealing

8

with parolees is very similar to the kinds of searches

9

that this Court has approved before, in the past.
The analysis to look at is whether or not the

10
11

individual had a diminished expectation of privacy and

12

whether there were special needs.

3

a parolee who was released --

4

QUESTION:

Clearly, we think that

To be more precise, you think the

5

suspicionless search would not violate the Fourth

6

Amendment if the parolee has consented to it, and that if

7

the Pennsylvania supreme court were free to adopt what it

8

though the right reading of that consent form was, it

9

would so interpret it?
GENERAL FISHER:

20

That's correct.

That's

21

correct.

But in the prior cases, where this Court has

22

approved suspicionless searches involving drug tests of

23

student athletes, sobriety checkpoints, the searches of

24

firearm dealers border stops, we think this case --we

25

think this case involving parolees fits right within those

exceptions which the Court has properly made in the past,

approving suspicionless searches.

questions, I will reserve the balance of my time for --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

8

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

9

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

10
11
12

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Although the United States believes that parole

13

may validly be conditioned on the parolee's consent to

14

search, we also believe that this case can be decided on

15

the alternative ground that the Fourth Amendment

16

exclusionary rule should not apply to parole revocation

17

proceedings.

18

This Court, when deciding whether the

19

exclusionary rule should be extended to procedural

20

settings other than the criminal trial, has recognized

21

that that determination turns on a balance of the public

22

and governmental interests at stake against the likely

23

determination of exclusion of unlawfully acquired

24

evidence, and in our view there are two distinct

25

governmental interests that militate against application
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

of the exclusionary rule.
First, and I think the nub of our argument is

2

3

that where an individual has already been convicted of a

4

crime and has been released in the community based upon

5

the condition that he abide by specified terms of release,

6

there is an overriding public and governmental interest in

7

accurate and complete information regarding the question

8

of whether the parolee has, in fact, complied with those

9

terms.

10

At the very premise of parole is that parolees,

11

persons previously convicted of crimes, pose a greater

12

risk of committing further unlawful acts than does the

3

average citizen, and the purpose of the revocation hearing

4

is not simply to punish the parolee for violation of the

5

conditions of his release but rather to determine whether

6

the parolee can safely be left in the community.

7

QUESTION:

Yes, but is that realistic, because I

8

don't know how much longer this individual is going to be

put away as a result of the revocation here, but I assume

20

that in most States a parole revocation can result in a

21

very substantial incarceration.

22

And I am assuming the second thing that you may

23

want to comment on, and that is that if there is a

24

substantial period of reincarceration, the likelihood of

25

an independent criminal prosecution for the acts that led

1

to the commitment, recommitment, is probably very low.

2

The State is probably not going to bother to prosecute if

3

they can put the person away for a substantial period of

4

time on a parole revocation.
So my questions are, isn't it in fact a lot like

5
6

a criminal trial?
MR. STEWART:

7

It is certainly -- it has some of

8

the same consequences of a criminal trial, namely that the

9

individual is incarcerated.
With respect to Mr. Scott, the State has

10
11

represented in its reply brief that Scott was up for

12

reparole I believe in 1997 and reparole was denied, and

13

that he is up for reparole again in 1998, so certainly the

14

finding of parole violations may ultimately have the

15

effect of requiring him to serve his whole term.
On the other hand, they do not preclude the

16
17

possibility that he can convince the State parole board

18

that in fact he warrants rerelease notwithstanding both

19

the prior crime and the subsequent violation of the terms

20

of parole.

21

As to your second question, while parole does

22

have some of the same consequences as the initial criminal

23

conviction, the Court has recognized most emphatically in

24

Morrissey v. Brewer that the parole revocation proceeding

25

need not take on the procedural accoutrements of the

1

criminal trial, that because the individual's initial

2

liberty interest has already been extinguished by the fact

3

of the prior crime and the prior conviction, what is at

4

stake is the conditional liberty interest of somebody who

5

has been released as subject both to conditions that

6

wouldn't be imposed on the citizenry at large and closer

7

supervision and monitoring to make sure that those

8

conditions are met.

9

QUESTION:

I think what I had in the back of my

10

mind was this argument.

11

guess, as I recall, it's made here, that nothing much is

12

to be gained for society at large by applying an

13

exclusionary rule here because it's already gained by

14

applying the exclusionary rule in criminal trials, so that

15

in point of fact, if the officer is not deterred from

16

illegal conduct by knowledge that the evidence so seized

17

cannot be used in a criminal trial, there's not going to

18

be any incremental deterrence by saying well, you can't

19

use it in a parole revocation either.

20

The argument is made, and I

If, on the other hand, the parole revocation is

21

probably going to be the only proceeding in which this

22

evidence is used, if the parole revocation really is

23

functioning like a criminal trial and that's the only

24

trial that there's going to be, then the argument about

25

deterring the police is not a sound -- or the parole

1

officers in this case is not a sound argument.

2

Because in fact the only proceeding in which the

3

evidence is likely to be used to satisfy society's demands

4

is the proceeding for the revocation of parole and

5

therefore it would make sense, if we are going to take the

6

Fourth Amendment to apply here, to say there ought to be

7

an exclusionary rule for the same reason that we do in the

8

case of a normal criminal trial.

9

MR. STEWART:

I think the two answers we would

10

say to that are, first, individual cases may arise in

11

which the primary or even the only use of the evidence

12

acquired is for parole revocation proceedings.

13

But an officer certainly wouldn't know that

14

before he or she began to conduct the search, and the

15

possibility that evidence of very serious additional

16

criminal acts might be discovered and might not be usable

17

at a subsequent criminal prosecution for those acts would

18

be expected to amount to a substantial deterrent to the

19

extent that the individual parole officer was looking at

20

things from a law enforcement perspective.

21

The other thing, the point I would like to make,

22

and I think this follows on the heels of the point that

23

General Fisher was making, is that we expect parole

24

officers to operate under a different incentive structure

25

than do police officers.

(800) FOR DEPO

1

That is not to deny that there is a law

2

enforcement component to what parole officers do.

3

Certainly there is.

4

But the parole officer also develops a

5

continuing relationship with the parolee, thinks of the

6

parolee as a client in some sense, and is expected to

7

balance those two possibly competing obligations.

8

9

And for instance, this Court has said that
magistrates and State legislators don't need the deterrent

10

of the exclusionary rule, because they can be expected to

11

be neutral without it.

12

Presumably the Court didn't mean that

13

magistrates and State legislators have no interest in the

14

apprehension of criminals or the enforcement of the

15

criminal law.

16

Rather, those officials are neutral in the sense

17

that they are institutionally well-positioned to take

18

account both of the societal interest in the enforcement

19

of the law and the individual interest in avoiding

20

unwarranted incursions on personal liberty, and we --

21

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, can I ask you one

question before your time is up?
What is the position of the United States on the

24

other issue in the case, whether there was a violation of

25

the Fourth Amendment, and whether Pennsylvania was

2

following Pennsylvania law or Federal law?
MR. STEWART:

Our position is that if the

3

consent form is construed to authorize searches without

4

individualized suspicion, that that consent form is

5

consistent with the Fourth Amendment.

6

We don't take a position on what the

7

Pennsylvania consent form meant, and we frankly think that

8

the Pennsylvania supreme court's opinion both in this case

9

and in Williams are ambiguous on that score.

10

I think that means on the one hand that there is

11

not the plain statement of independent State law grounds

12

that would preclude this Court's jurisdiction --

3

QUESTION:

So --

4

MR. STEWART:

5

QUESTION:

-- but I think it also means --- you would take the view that if

6

it's ambiguous, then, the Michigan v. Long principle

7

applies, and we assume that they were at least pushed in

8

their direction by the Federal Constitution?

9

MR. STEWART:

I -- we assume for purposes of

20

determining whether this Court has jurisdiction to reach

21

the issue obviously, when the Court has two alternative

22

grounds on which it could decide the case, the relative

23

certainty that the Pennsylvania supreme court's resolution

24

of exclusionary rule issue was based solely on Federal

25

constitutional grounds might cause the Court as a

prudential matter to decide that that's likely to be a

cleaner and more final resolution of the case than

deciding the case on the consent issue.

7

QUESTION:

What would we do if we disagreed with

you on that question?
MR. STEWART:

If you disagreed with us on the

exclusionary rule?

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

MR. STEWART:

If you disagreed with us on the

10

exclusionary rule, then I suppose you would have to

11

determine first whether you had jurisdiction to determine

12

the propriety of the search and, second, if you had

13

jurisdiction whether the search was valid.

14

QUESTION:

15

be constitutional questions?

16

You regard both of those questions to

MR. STEWART:

Well, the Fourth Amendment

17

exclusionary rule question is -- it's a question of

18

Federal law.

19

the Court has said that the exclusionary rule is not

20

constitutionally compelled.

21

It is constitutionally grounded.

Obviously,

The Court has, however, held that State courts

22

are required to employ the Federal -- the Fourth Amendment

23

exclusionary rule in State criminal proceedings, and to

24

that extent this Court has held it has authority to

25

require that procedure of at least some State officials.

Again, going back to what we see as the

1

2

overriding governmental interest here, this Court in

3

Lopez-Mendoza made clear that the exclusionary rule, at

4

least ordinarily, would not be applicable in situations

5

where the purpose of a proceeding was to determine whether

6

an ongoing violation was being committed, as opposed to

7

proceedings where the purpose was to impose a sanction for

8

a prior violation.
I mean, in some sense a parole revocation

9
10

hearing has attributes of both.

11

talking about a violation, possession of firearms, that

12

occurred at a discrete point in time.

On the one hand, we are

On the other hand,

3

the point of the proceeding is, again, to determine not

4

simply whether Mr. Scott should be punished for a prior

5

bad act, but whether he can safely be allowed to remain in

6

the community.

7

And the final thing I'd say is, we do think that

8

the nature of parole revocation hearings is such that

9

imposition of the exclusionary rule would substantially

20

change the character of the proceeding.
That is, in the Federal system, for instance --

21

I'm sorry.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD N. SOSNOV

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4
5

MR. SOSNOV:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As an initial matter I think there are two

6

reasons why the Court should not raise -- reach the issue

7

of whether a parolee can voluntarily consent to

8

suspicionless searches.

9

already mentioned, and that is that there is an

10
11

The first one the Court has

independent and adequate State ground here.
Unlike Michigan v. Long, this case involves a

12

State regulation, a State parole form to construe.

13

Michigan v. Long just involved a free-floating

14

constitutional analysis.

15

Secondly, this Court said in Griffin that when

16

there is a State regulation involved, as in this case, we

17

take the meaning as fixed by the Supreme Court before we

18

get to any constitutional analysis.

19

Thirdly, if you look at the Pennsylvania supreme

20

court in this case, as far as the opinion, the supreme

21

court opinion refers only to one case, Williams. It says,

22

we rely on Williams, the Pennsylvania supreme court case.

23

It says that twice.

24

QUESTION:

25

If this Court -In regard to your second point, Mr.

Sosnov, we do have several cases that say if a State court

in deciding a question before it is mistakenly of the view

2

that its conclusion is required by the Fourth Amendment,

3

then we will --we have jurisdiction to disabuse it of

4

that if we don't think it's required by the Fourth

5

Amendment.
MR. SOSNOV:

6

Correct, if the State felt

7

compelled, and what I'm saying is that the evidence here

8

is not that the State felt compelled, because the

9

Pennsylvania supreme court referred only to a Pennsylvania

10

supreme court decision.
QUESTION:

11

Yes, but it's true, the portion of

12

the Pennsylvania supreme court in Williams, it's under the

13

subhead Fourth Amendment.

MR. SOSNOV:

independently analyzes the Pennsylvania constitution, and

2

reaches the result of that's how we're going to construe

3

that --

4

QUESTION:

And that part of it says that in --

5

lots of times our constitution gives greater protection

6

than the Federal does, but not in this case.

7

MR. SOSNOV:

And it cites no Federal

8

constitutional law in making the independent

9

constitutional analysis.

Under Pennsylvania

10

constitutional analysis this Court's opinions are not

11

referred to.

They look to other States.

QUESTION:

12

They look to --

Don't they say in the opinion, this

13

very opinion, that they're not relying on the Pennsylvania

14

constitution?

15

MR. SOSNOV:

They're not relying on the

16

Pennsylvania constitution in this very case, but in this

17

very case, before they get to the Fourth Amendment issue

18

they're making an independent construction of the State

19

provision.

20

I'd like to point out one other thing, and that

21

is that this Court looks beyond the face of Scott

22

referring to Williams.

23

supreme court case, Commonwealth v. Gibson, cited in my

24

brief, which says as a matter of State Pennsylvania law

25

consent has to be specific and unequivocal, and now that

gets to my second position.
When you read the provision, the provision says,

2

3

I consent to without a warrant.

4

disagrees with me on the adequate independent State ground

issue.

6

this Court construing that provision.

Where does that leave us?

7

Let's say this Court

That leaves us with

If you construe that provision without a

8

warrant, certainly in light of this Court's prior

9

jurisprudence without a warrant doesn't mean without any

objective level of information.

12

13

suspicion.

14

Griffin itself said, you
You

Terry v. Ohio, you need reasonable

You don't need a warrant.
There is nothing on the face of this provision

15

that waives anything, if it's capable of waiving anything,

16

that waives anything except a warrant.

17

QUESTION:

But if you did interpret it -- I

18

mean, I'm not -- I know that you think we shouldn't, but

19

if you did reach the following question, is a random gun

20

search consistent with the Fourth Amendment, I take it on

21

the merits the question would be, if the Fourth Amendment

22

permits random drug searches without consent of persons

23

have been convicted?

Assuming that Pennsylvania thought that the

Constitution, the Fourth Amendment, prohibits a random gun

12

The argument against it, if the Constitution

permits a random gun search without consent of a person

answer?
MR. SOSNOV:

Now, what's the

The answer to that is that this

Court should not find voluntary consent, because as this

Court has interpreted the term before, it certainly should

11

not abandon that interpretation.

13

coercion, explicit or implied.

QUESTION:

What voluntary consent

Now, unless --

Are you saying, then, that a parolee

can't consent to any of the terms of the parole?
MR. SOSNOV:

16

No.

That's not my position at all.

17

What I'm saying is, the State cannot impose an

18

unconstitutional condition as a matter of probation or

19

parole and then try to sustain that on a theory, a

20

fictional theory of consent, as in this case.
QUESTION:

MR. SOSNOV:

QUESTION:

Of course.
That's certainly a violation of the

First Amendment.
MR. SOSNOV:

But it doesn't depend -- the

validity of parole conditions and probation conditions

6

don't depend on the consent, or a fictional notion of

7

consent of the probation of parolee.

8

9
10
11

Every day around the country people are put on
probation, they're put on parole, and nobody asks the
consent of the probationer to particular conditions.
QUESTION:

Well, then what you're saying is that

12

the Pennsylvania parole authorities without calling this a

13

consent form could simply say, here are the conditions

14

under which you must be -- which you will -- your house

15

will be searched.

16

MR. SOSNOV:

That's correct, but as long as they

were constitutional they'd be upheld by this Court, but if

MR. SOSNOV:

This Court would have to determine

that each one, whether it was reasonable or not.
Given all the reasoning of Griffin, the one --

it could set explicitly, your condition of parole is that

you will be subjected to searches of your home without

don't understand your position.

MR. SOSNOV:

Because in neither case does it

In neither case the correct

constitutional analysis is to determine, is it reasonable,

rights of the parolee, whether we talk about First

agree to a prison sentence of 3 years, very coercive.

3

Heavens, look at the power the Government has, and yet I

think we would say it's okay to give up your right to a

those things.

You can consent to that.

7

Now, don't look at the clock.

MR. SOSNOV:

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.
I want to know why somebody can't

paroled and I will consent to these terms and conditions.

Why isn't that perfectly okay?

14

conditions.

15

The person can refuse

I'll serve my time, thank you.

MR. SOSNOV:

I think the answer, Justice

16

O'Connor, is that there's nothing -- this is nothing like

17

the free bargaining process.

18

emphasized in a number of decisions is the plea-bargaining

19

process is bargaining between two roughly equal parties,

20

and that the defendant has a lot of bargaining chips in

21

that situation, so the process is completely different.

What this Court has

22

The defendant can insist on a trial.

23

defendant can insist to be put to the proof of beyond a

24

reasonable doubt, so that every day, defendants reject

25

plea bargains that are offered, because defendant

we may lose entirely and the defendant will go scott-

Here, the process itself, the parolee has no

bargaining chips whatsoever.

constitutional rights that he can bargain with, so the

process is different.
QUESTION:

Well, but the parolee can decline it

and say, I'll serve my time and when I get out I am free.
MR. SOSNOV:

11

If -- the parolee has the ability

12

to say no, and Schneckloth said everybody always has the

13

ability to say no.

That's what

I think Minnesota v. Murphy is a good example of

coercion, where a person has a right to say no.

21

can continue being a police officer, or you can start

QUESTION:

12

-- what is in the back of my mind,

which is, is whether it might be reasonable for a State to

4

say we don't have that many parole officers, we'll let

5

more people out of prison on parole, but they give up all

6

their privacy in prison, and we want them to give up some

7

of their privacy on parole, and the reason is that random

8

checking can catch those who have guns or drugs.

9

So I mean, suppose they're reasoning that way,

20

and so the object is a system that will actually protect

21

people's privacy in a sense.

We're going to parole fewer people if you

2

actually make us have a hearing to determine whether we

3

revoke them or not, and this Court said there's no

4

empirical proof that if people have a hearing and have

5

some rights that they're going to stop paroling people.
And, in fact, most jurisdictions around the

6

7

country right now have interpreted Griffin as -- in fact,

8

every court that has interpreted Griffin has interpreted

9

it to require reasonable suspicion.

However, you have not

10

seen a drop-off of paroles around the country or any

11

disadvantage to the parole system, so there is no

12

demonstrated need.
And getting back to the plea-bargaining question

13

of Justice O'Connor, the other thing that distinguishes

this from a plea bargain is that of course the Government

The consent is a fictional notion.

If this

MR. SOSNOV:

7

This Court said it would be the classic penalty

Let me mention another one.

Morrissey v.

8

Brewer, the rights at a hearing, Pennsylvania under the

fiction of consent could say, in return for you getting

10

probation or parole you hereby agree that if we decide to

11

revoke your parole you won't assert your right to try to

12

cross-examine and confront witnesses.

13

In other words, this Court would be ceding its

14

role as being the ultimate determiner of what's reasonable

under the Constitution if it accepts the fiction of

consent, which it has refused to do in the economic

MR. SOSNOV:

2

The majority of States have ruled,

3

and this Court should rule that the exclusionary rule

4

applies, because it's especially needed in this context.

5

First of all, under Pennsylvania law, what was

6

being performed here was a classic law enforcement

7

function.

8

officers share with police the primary goal of law

enforcement.

Pennsylvania's own manual says that the parole

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SOSNOV:

Why didn't they have suspicion here?
Because the two incidents that I

13

referred to were 5 or 6 months earlier, and the only

14

information conveyed to the searching officer, at page 92a

15

of the appendix, is that one officer said to the other, he

16

may have firearms, and that's all that was communicated,

17

nothing else about a basis for a search, and Pennsylvania

18

has never claimed that there's reasonable suspicion in

19

this case in the lower courts or here.

20

The primary zone of interest, as this Court has

21

defined, looking at the exclusionary rule, the purpose is

22

deterrence.

23

The question is deterrence.

So when the Attorney General talks about the

24

question of we're looking for the truth at a parole

probation revocation hearing, that's what we seek, that's

2

true, but it's talking about constitutional apples and

3

oranges here.

4

There is a cost whenever you apply the

5

exclusionary rule as far as some evidence that might be

helpful to determine the truth if it's going to be

7

excluded from the proceeding.

8

it necessary to enforce Fourth Amendment values?

9

the question.

The question is, though, is

And here, the answer is clear.

10

That's

The parole

officer is even more motivated than a police officer

The police officer in the community has many

The parole officer deals only with the

19

population of convicted criminals, the pressure, the

20

institutional pressure being responsible for convicted

21

criminals and their supervision, and secondly, one-on-one

22

responsibility.

23

That parole agent was assigned to a particular

24

individual, so if that particular individual violates

parole in a serious way, commits a new crime, the

responsibility goes right back to the parole agent, so we

2

start out with great institutional pressures on the parole

3

agent, more so than the policeman, to try to detect

4

violations of parole.
And Pennsylvania, if you look at are there

alternative remedies to the exclusionary rule to try to

provide a disincentive for unconstitutional searches,

8

Pennsylvania has no alternative remedies.

pressures and zeal at doing their job and protecting

QUESTION:

But if being a good parole officer,

2

as Justice Kennedy's question -- means keeping your people

out on parole rather than reincarcerating them, one would

think that the institutional, pressures are in the

5

opposite direction, not to return as many of the people in

6

your charge to prison as possible, but to work with them

7

to keep them out.

8

MR. SOSNOV:

Some work to keep them out, but the

9

pressures to make sure that they're complying with parole

0

regulations, we're talking about now the pressures as far

11

as individuals who may go into somebody's home with no

12

reasonable suspicion whatsoever.

3

We're not talking about parole agents who, in

4

accordance with the reasoning of Griffin, only go in the

5

homes where they have that low objective standard of

6

reasonable suspicion.

7

who may go into their home without that objective basis of

8

reasonable suspicion.

9

We're talking about parole agents

The institutional pressures might be, I don't

20

want to see my name in the newspaper possibly because my

21

parolee got in some kind of trouble, so therefore -- this

22

is going to be some parole officers -- the institutional

pressures are going to cause them to violate the

the need for the exclusionary rule.

Yes, but that's -- a neutral

3

magistrate in that sense is not the same as the person who

4

finally disposes of a case, of a question the way you

5

would have under the exclusionary rule.

6

Do you know of any other situations in which

7

nonlawyers decide whether or not evidence should be

8

excluded pursuant to the exclusionary rule?

9

MR. SOSNOV:

I know that right now there are

10

about eight States that are applying the exclusionary rule

11

either on State constitutional grounds, where they've

12

interpreted it under the Federal Constitution, and not all

13

of them have judges deciding these issues, and there's

14

been no evidence that they've been incapable of making

15

this reasonable suspicion determination as to whether the

16

Constitution has been complied with as far as reasonable

17

suspicion being required for an entry into the home of a

18

parolee and his family.

19

difficulties have been reported.

20

There have been -- no encountered

One of the dangers here, I think, if the

21

exclusionary rule is not recognized in this context, is

22

because the standard is only reasonable suspicion for the

23

intrusion in the first place, if this Court doesn't

24

recognize the exclusionary rule, that means that there's

25

no neutral oversight whatsoever before the parole agents

go into the home, nor is there any kind of neutral

oversight after the fact.

3

The creation is, as the Pennsylvania supreme

4

court said, I think they got it right as far as concluding

5

there will be nothing else to deter parole agents.

will have no neutral oversight before, because only

7

reasonable suspicion is required, you will have no neutral

8

oversight after the fact, the Pennsylvania parole board

has no institutional deterrence mechanisms in force,

there's no punishment for violations -QUESTION:

No worse than the situation that the

MR. SOSNOV:

Well, it hasn't so far, because

QUESTION:

Mr. Sosnov, you don't mean it happens

8

so far in the sense of the real world, because you told me

9

it was correct that most States in their parole revocation

hearings do not exclude unlawfully seized evidence, so

11

it's true that right now, that this happens all the time,

is that not so?
