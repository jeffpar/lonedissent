ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD R. PATTERSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. PATTERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court granted certiorari in this case on one

12

issue only, whether the gender discrimination provisions

13

in 8 U.S.C. section 1409 violate the Constitution.

14

court of appeals felt that this Court's opinion in Fiallo

15

v. Bell was a controlling precedent.

16

that Fiallo can be distinguished, but that if the Court

17

feels that it applies, that Fiallo is out of step with the

18

Court's more recent decisions that refuse to sanction

19

official actions that close a door to opportunity based on

20

overbroad generalizations concerning the abilities, or

21

personalities or such, of males and females.

22

The

It is our position

The Immigration & Nationality Act draws some

23

clear distinctions between the naturalization of an

24

individual about whom alienage is not in dispute and those

25

persons who are citizens at birth.

Naturalization is the

conferring of nationality of a State upon an individual

subsequent to their birth.

3

to a U.S. citizen are citizens and nationals of the United

4

States at birth.

5

QUESTION:

Persons who are born overseas

Am I right, Mr. Patterson, in

6

thinking that your client has never set foot in the United

7

States?

8

9

MR. PATTERSON:

My client has set foot in the

United States, in fact is presently in the United States,

10

but not at the time that this case was filed and

11

originally came forth, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

Thank you.

13

MR. PATTERSON:

Unlike the person who is seeking

14

naturalization or immigration, Ms. Miller seeks to

15

establish her citizenship by virtue of her birth.

16

deference accorded the Congress power over admissions of

17

aliens is inapplicable in dealing with a situation where

18

someone claims citizenship from birth, and we feel there

19

is a clear distinction here, that she has been denied her

20

equal protection rights, and she seeks a finding that she

21

is a citizen at birth, and thus Fiallo can be

22

distinguished.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

The

But how do you say Fiallo is

distinguishable in that regard?
MR. PATTERSON:

Fiallo dealt with a situation

1

where there was no question concerning the alienage of the

2

persons involved.

3

should have been entitled to citizenship at birth, and

4

therefore it is not an immigration matter but a

5

citizenship matter, and could be distinguished on that

6

basis.

7

In this case, we claim that my client

Fiallo could be left to apply in cases in which

8

they were purely immigration.

This case is not so much

9

based on the immigration powers of Congress as it is upon

10

the gender discrimination that is established in this

11

provision.
QUESTION:

12

But you have to have a part of a law

13

of Congress declared unconstitutional in order to

14

establish your client's citizenship, do you not?

15
16

MR. PATTERSON:
feel that --

17
18

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

You say there's no deference to

Congress in this respect?

19

MR. PATTERSON:

Your Honor, while the Court

20

gives deference to Congress in many areas, the Court has

21

held that it does not -- deference does not mean

22

abdication, and that if a statute is violative of the

23

provisions of the Constitution, then that statute cannot

24

stand.

25

QUESTION:

Yes, but I think some of -- there's

We

1

language in some of our cases that say in the field of

2

immigration and nationality we give extraordinary

3

deference to what Congress has decided.

4

Now, you're saying, I guess, that when you're

5

talking about nationality as opposed to immigration the

6

Congress gets no special deference.

7

MR. PATTERSON:

I think Congress always gets a

8

certain amount of deference, Your Honor, in any case,

9

because I think the Court normally approaches that they

10

are -- Congress is entitled to do what is within its

11

realm, but if it violates -- if it provides a provision

12

that deprives people of the equal protection of the

13

Constitution, then that statute cannot stand, and dealing

14

with --

15

QUESTION:

May I just interrupt with a question?

16

I'm not sure I understood.

17

constitutional entitlement to citizenship at birth?

18

MR. PATTERSON:

Are you saying there is a

There is not a constitutional

19

entitlement of citizenship at birth unless you are born in

20

the United States.

21

QUESTION:

Okay.

22

MR. PATTERSON:

However, the Congress has

23

created a statute which provides that children of U.S.

24

citizen parents are entitled to citizenship at birth, but

25

then they have in effect taken away that right as to those

children who are illegitimate in that section 1401

2

establishes a broad general statement that all children

3

born to U.S. citizen parents in the world are U.S.

4

citizens at birth.

5

QUESTION:

Then in 14 -Well, let me just interrupt with a

6

simple question to be sure.

7

for Congress to pass a statute saying that any child born

8

abroad of American parents shall become a citizen at the

9

age of 10, regardless of who the -- which parent was

I think it would be.

Okay.
The Congress has tremendous

Congress probably could decide --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. PATTERSON:

17

Would it be constitutional

Okay.
-- that no one born outside of

the United States was a citizen.

18

QUESTION:

All right.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Patterson, on that line, you

20

don't take issue with Judge Wald's statement, do you, that

21

I see no problem with the requirement that a U.S. citizen

22

parent take some action to acknowledge parentage or

23

responsibility for a child before the child reaches age

24

18?

25

If -- suppose Congress said, mothers, fathers,

they're both parents, and if a child is born abroad, one

of them has to say, I will take responsibility for this

11

QUESTION:

Well --

12

QUESTION:

It's interesting, is it not, that

13

from 1790 till 1934, there was, as I understand the

14

statutes, no way that a mother could fit under them.

15

all depended on fatherhood.

16

MR. PATTERSON:

It

That is my understanding, Your

17

Honor, and as to children born prior to 1934, it's only

18

been recently that Congress has gone back to correct that

19

situation.

found to be unconstitutional.

QUESTION:

We're talking about 1790 to 1934,

under the precedent that then existed --

4

MR. PATTERSON:

Under the precedent that then

5

existed,

but I feel that under the precedents that exist now,

7

would be considered unconstitutional.

I would assume that it was not unconstitutional,

But you're still talking

about the same Constitution.
MR. PATTERSON:

10
11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Mr. Patterson, you mentioned a moment

13

ago that the way you view the relationship between 1401

14

and 1409 is that 1401 first provides citizenship on

15

individuals like your client, and then 1409 in effect

16

takes it away, but that does not seem to me a fair

17

characterization of the statute, because 1409,

18

subsection (a)

19

1401 simply does not apply to individuals like your client

20

in cases of illegitimacy unless certain conditions are

21

satisfied,

22

by assuming that 1401 gives you something which is then

23

taken away on a disparate criterion.

24
25

in its

seems to me to make it pretty clear that

so I don't see how you can start your argument

MR. PATTERSON:

Well, Your Honor, we feel that

1409 as it exists now is an unconstitutional

discrimination based on gender, and -QUESTION:

Well, that's the -- maybe I

3

misunderstand you, but I think that's a separate argument.

4

I thought you -- the question was, you know, how do you

5

get into court in the first place, and you say, well -- or

6

I guess the question was on deference, and you say, well,

7

the deference issue is different here because my client in

8

effect is given citizenship to begin with, so that she

9

starts as a citizen claimant in a way that the other

10
11

plaintiff did not.
But it seems to me that if your reason for that

12

is the provision of 1401, your argument fails, because

13

1409 says 1401 doesn't apply unless you meet these

14

conditions.

15

MR. PATTERSON:

Your Honor, basically, though,

16

1409 we view as being a gender discrimination issue, and

17

that in this situation, that if it did not apply my client

18

would be, under the general terms of 1401, a citizen, and

19

we feel that there is a distinction between a situation

20

where someone is purely an alien, no question about it

21

all, of their alienage, and a situation where there is a

22

relationship, a tie to the United States through a citizen

23

parent, and that the rules as to the citizen parent should

24

be the same whether the parent is a woman or a man.

25

QUESTION:

Let me interrupt you there, because

1

is it not the fact that most of the cases we're concerned

2

with probably are illegitimate children of service people

3

abroad, and isn't it also a fact that the vast -- maybe

4

not the vast majority, but the preponderant number of

5

those would probably be of a male parent rather than a

6

female parent?

7

MR. PATTERSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, Your Honor --

And isn't it also true that at the

time of birth, when it's a female parent there's no

10

question about what's going to happen to that child,

11

whereas at the time of birth of a child of a male parent

12

by a female alien, when the male parent may not be on the

13

spot at all, or even within the general area, there are a

14

lot of questions that have to be resolved in the future?

15

MR. PATTERSON:

All right.

There are some

16

questions, Your Honor, but my understanding is that

17

statistically there are more female U.S. citizens abroad

18

than male U.S. citizens.

19

Forces that now the percentage is somewhere like 13 or 14

20

percent of all the Armed Forces are now female.

MR. PATTERSON:

I do know that within the Armed

Right.
So while we may have had a

problem with one situation in the past, I think the

different from 87 percent.
MR. PATTERSON:

Right.

That is correct, Your

Honor, but I think that also the question or the issue we

have here is that the requirements are placed on the male

All that the woman has to do is be the

11
12

Right.

If there's any hospital

13

QUESTION:

With regard to the male parent, there

14

are a lot of questions that are unanswered at the time of

the male parent can be established with modern technology.

3

QUESTION:

Servicemen being overseas and shipped

back to this country.
MR. PATTERSON:

Right.

There are potential

4

problems, but the problems can be dealt with.

We feel

5

that the only requirement should be that there be proof

6

submitted that this is the child of a U.S. citizen.

7

Now, what that proof may be, because there's --

8

QUESTION:

9

Would you say that it would be fair

to say the proof must be submitted within 36 hours after

10

birth, and if you treat both sexes equally, the only

11

requirement is that parentage must be established within

12

the first 2 weeks after birth?

13

MR. PATTERSON:

14

QUESTION:

I think --

I think --

-- you'd have many, many children of

15

male, unmarried parents who would not be able to comply

16

with that requirement.

17

MR. PATTERSON:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

18

I feel that while there have been some other areas where

19

this Court has determined that it is not necessary to have

20

an immediate determination of the parentage of a child for

21

the child to ultimately be able to proceed in terms of

22

inheritance and this sort of thing, in a sense this is an

23

inheritance.

24

we would like to see the tables leveled as to both the

25

male and female as to what takes place.

This is an inheritance of a citizenship, and

But only in one way, only in one

direction.

Let me ask you this.

Does your client have

4

standing to assert the father's gender discrimination

claim?

6

MR. PATTERSON:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

Your Honor, we feel that she --

I hadn't thought so.

He was in the

case at one point.
MR. PATTERSON:

Right, Your Honor, and the

10

Government in a motion said that the rights and benefits

11

of U.S. citizenship he already enjoys simply have not been

12

injured by the denial of Lorelyn Penero Miller's

13

application.

14

are those of Lorelyn Penero Miller, the true plaintiff in

15

this action.

Government -QUESTION:

Well, the short answer is, the father

is no longer before us, is that right?

20

MR. PATTERSON:

21

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And does this petitioner, can she --

22

does she have standing to raise any claims that he might

23

raise on gender discrimination?

MR. PATTERSON:

We feel that under the criteria

that the Court has set out for third party plaintiffs to

1

proceed are based on third party claims, that there has to

2

be an injury, which there is, there has to be a

3

relationship, which there is.

4

The only issue that the Government has raised in

5

its brief is the issue of a hindrance, and we would say

6

that there is a hindrance created by the Government in

7

their motion to remove him from the case, that they took

8

him out --

9

QUESTION:

When the Government moved to dismiss

10

the father and then coupled that with a motion to transfer

11

the case from Texas to the District of Columbia, I assume

12

that if the Government thought that there was no -- well,

13

what did the Government tell the district court in Texas

14

about why the father had no standing?

15

MR. PATTERSON:

Basically their argument in

16

their motion, Your Honor, was as I said, that he had not

17

made application for U.S. citizenship; he was not denied

18

any rights; he had his citizenship; that the denial --

19
20

QUESTION:

Then the case got shipped to the

district court in D.C.

21

MR. PATTERSON:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

That is correct.

Was there an effort made by the

father to appeal his dismissal from the case?
MR. PATTERSON:

No, Your Honor, there was not an

attempt to appeal.

QUESTION:

Would there have been a -- the

2

problem of the transfer intervening, where would the

3

father have brought that appeal?

4

out of the district court in Texas, they lose -- that

5

circuit loses authority over it.

6

MR. PATTERSON:

Once the case is shipped

I am not certain, Your Honor,

7

and I would think that that was -- one of the factors that

8

entered into us not appealing was the fact that it was

9

moved to another circuit, that the principal issues were

10

still before the court in the District, and we felt that

11

we could go forward and proceed there, that --

12

QUESTION:

I'd like you to clarify one earlier

13

point, because there were references to many, many

14

qualifications, but I think -- am I right about this --

15

that you were relying at least alternately on the prior

16

version of 1409, when there was no requirement of a

17

written acknowledgement of support, when all that was

18

required was an acknowledgement, a legitimation of the

19

child by the father saying yes, I am the father.

20

was not this additional requirement, as there is now,

21

about a written undertaking to support.

22

MR. PATTERSON:

23

QUESTION:

There

That is correct, Your Honor.

So we don't have before us the

24

question of the residency requirement, because he

25

satisfies that, so that's an academic question.

As this Court said in the Ginsberg decision, no

alien has the slightest right to naturalization unless all

statutory conditions are satisfied, and by the same token,

the Court has said in the Rogers v. Belli decision that

was just cited, no United States citizen has a right to

transmit citizenship by dissent.

Now, to be sure, where the interests of the

his statement that he is the father, but of course, under

the State Department.

5

The State Department was not a party to that

case, so insofar as she is applying on the basis of events

7

that happened before age 21, or before age 18, we think

8

she would have to carry that burden of proof before the

9

State Department.

10

The State Department did not reach that

11

question, as you pointed out in this case.

The basis for

12

the State Department's rejection for a claim in this case

13

was really the failure to establish the formal parent-

14

child relationship prior to the age 18 or, under the prior

15

statute, age 21, so really the issue before this Court and

before the district court was whether Congress can

In Rogers,

10

there was a situation where there was a conferral of

citizenship subject to a subsequent loss of divestiture,

on failure to satisfy conditions subsequent, so at that

point we think that the person had her foot in the door,

14

or his foot in the door towards citizenship, in fact was

granted citizenship, and it was about to be taken away.

And this situation is very different.

The

question is whether the petitioner is entitled to

citizenship in the first instance and, as this Court

19

pointed out many years ago in the Wong Kim Ark decision,

20

the conferral of citizenship on anyone who is not born

21

within the United States is an act of naturalization.

is the only subject -- section of the act that deals with

11

the subject of children born out of wedlock, and

12

Congress -- it was a very difficult subject for Congress

13

to address in the Nationality Act of 1940 and ever since

then, and there was considerable debate leading up to the

passage of the 1940 act about how to deal with a situation

No.

Our bottom line is that the

3

Whether that comes from interpreting the word

5

the territorial scope of the Fifth Amendment, I'm not sure

6

much turns on that, but in this Court's decision in

7

Johnson v. Eisentrager, which was reiterated in the

8

Verdugo decision, the Court said that aliens outside the

9

United States have no rights under the Fifth Amendment.
Whether she has since come to the United States

10

11

is irrelevant for these purposes, because -QUESTION:

12

Didn't Johnson v. Eisentrager make a

13

distinction between one who was an alien and, I think the

words of the decision were, if a person makes a claim to

citizenship.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

I believe that was with respect

to access to courts, where another aspect of Johnson v.

Eisentrager was whether habeas corpus jurisdiction would

lie.

We're not suggesting that she has no right of

access to the U.S. courts to make her claim.

saying is that her claim fails on the merits because both,

there's nothing peculiar about the equal protection nature

QUESTION:

No.

Those are my two questions.

First let's think of the noncaretaker parents

why is there any reason in the world to believe that a

noncaretaker mother who's abandoned the child?

They're in the United States, the

And now my second question looks at it just the

20
21

other way.

Let's imagine now that both citizens are

22

caretakers, and what reason in the world is there to think

23

that a caretaker mother has more of a connection with the

24

child than a caretaker father, who after all is trying to

bring up the child by himself?

it seems to me this distinction is irrational, or close to

There may be other --

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, I understand that very

well with respect to your first criterion, where you say

10

you can't claim father status unless you show by clear and

11

convincing evidence that you are the father.

12

But for the rest, for the life of me -- if

13

you're going to say, yes, only the woman can bear the

child, there's no doubt that men will never be able to

have that great joy, but --

QUESTION:

-- just as only women can bear

whether the Government is now retreating from something it

repeated so often at the oral argument and in the brief.

because the law must not restrict men and women by

2

reflecting and reinforcing patterns of historic

3

discrimination.

The Government said that over and over.

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

We have certainly not retreated

5

from that.

You've asked me several questions, if I could

6

just take a moment and respond to them.

7

First of all, in the -- as this Court's decision

8

in Fiallo made clear, Congress' power over immigration and

9

naturalization is quite different from something that

10

would happen in the domestic context, and there are a

11

variety of reasons why that's so.
One of the parties to the transaction is an

12

13

alien abroad, not even protected by the Constitution at

14

all.

15

foreign relations, of Congress taking into account

16

conditions abroad.

are very different.

to do, if he had the sort of relationship that you were

describing, is to take the simple step of making that

question that was asked before in the context of not

know as a matter of statistics that there are many more

white fathers that take responsibility for their children

than nonwhite fathers.

this written acknowledgement of an obligation to support.

13

That will be required of citizen fathers who are nonwhite,

14

but not citizen fathers who are white, and we're basing

15

that on solid, empirical evidence of who provides support

16

for children.

17

Therefore, we're going to have

Would that be constitutional because it's in the

MR. KNEEDLER:

Needless to say, this case

doesn't go that far, but the question under Fiallo, the

21

standard, is whether the justification advanced is one

22

that is facially legitimate and bona fide, and in this

23

country's history of race relations it would be difficult

24

to imagine what a proper justification would be under

QUESTION:

doesn't fit with --

But you -- compelling justification

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I'm saying in terms of what

5

sort of justifications one could imagine, and I -- this

6

country --

7

QUESTION:

The justification is the practical

8

one that I gave you, the statistics will show that

9

disproportionately nonwhite fathers don't accept the

10

support obligation.
MR. KNEEDLER:

11

12

Well, in -- again, given this

country's history of race relations, and if there was a

3

U.S. citizen claiming an effect on his ability to transmit

4

because of that, it may be that under the phrase, facially

5

legitimate, this Court would conclude that that is not a

6

legitimate justification.

7

But there's a very different -- if I may just

8

go -- explain what's different about this case, this -- I

9

think it is clear that at the moment of birth there is a

20

categorical difference between the mother and the father

21

of the U.S. citizen and the mother because, as I described

22

earlier, in the child born out of wedlock, the mother has

a legal relationship with the child from the moment of

birth.

important in its own right.

8

fostering of a deeper personal relationship.

9

It isn't just the question of clear and

QUESTION:

The question is,

It is emblematic and often

Let's go to the emblematic issue,

10

because that's part of your argument with the converse

11

argument with respect to the more lenient treatment of the

12

child of the citizen mother.

13

One step in that argument, as I understand it,

14

is that because the mother is the citizen, the child will

15

be with the mother, the mother has an attachment to the

16

United States, therefore ultimately that will foster an

17

attachment of the child to the United States.

18

My question is, should we take that argument

19

seriously when in fact the statute requires of the

20

citizen's mother that she have an attachment only to the

21

extent of once at any time having lived for 1 year prior

22

to birth in the United States?

23

That doesn't seem to me to be a criterion that

24

calls for very much sense of attachment and if, in fact,

25

that's the low value that the United States is willing to

1

put on this attachment concept, isn't the argument a very-

2

weak argument, if not perhaps a sham?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

No.

With all respect, I

4

think that very situation shows why Congress has

5

particularly broad deference in this area, because what --

6

Congress has to judge not only the situation in the United

7

States and the U.S. citizen who may have a stake in it,

8

but what is the situation abroad in the foreign country

9

where, after all, the child was born?

10

And as we explain in our brief, Congress was

11

very concerned, and the legislative history makes this

12

quite clear, that a child born to a U.S. citizen on

13

foreign soil, and this remains true in the Philippines,

14

that child does not have citizenship of the country where

15

she is born, so there's a very real problem of

16

statelessness.

17

So what Congress is weighing there is perhaps a

18

weaker tie to the United States, but perhaps no legal

19

status at all in the country of birth, and so what

20

Congress did there is to say, in that situation, because

21

we are concerned for the child and for the mother of the

22

child, who is a U.S. citizen, we are prepared to accept a

She would have had all her growing up years in the United

States and yet, under this statute, she could not qualify

22

as the child of a U.S.-born citizen.

All the father had to do during

her minority was to take the step of either legitimating

I'm just asking the question about

the tie to the United States, so that becomes irrelevant.

Even though this child grew up in the United States,

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's conceivable there could be

an as-applied challenge to this statute, but in the

7

immigration area in particular Congress is entitled to

legislate by categories, and Congress is entitled --

QUESTION:
too.

In social and economic legislation,

See, that's really the problem that I have with it.
It used to be for years and years social and

12

economic legislation is anything goes, what Congress wants

13

to do, and yet all the precedent in the gender cases were

14

made in that area which traditionally has been a largely

15

judicial hands-off, so I'm frankly puzzled about why the

16

Government, after saying all gender classifications are

17

subject to heightened scrutiny, now says we found an

18

exception, so I'd like to know, are there other

19

exceptions?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

The exception and whether

21

there might be another one I can't address.

What we have

22

here is a very different context.

domestic context have to be justified as having a

interest, and also applied heightened scrutiny with

respect to illegitimacy.

But right contemporaneously with that -- and

this case is really about children born out of wedlock,

6

and as in this Court's decision in Lehrer v. Robertson,

7

where the Court said the statutory scheme is not likely to

8

omit many responsible parents, we think that is exactly

9

true here.
Anyone who wanted to establish the requisite

10
11

relationship during the child's minority, and that's the

12

period that Congress was focusing on, all that person had

13

to do prior to 1986 was to provide for legitimation of the

child.

Congress in 1986 liberalized that, not requiring a

All he had to do was file a statement with the

18

State Department acknowledging the paternity of the child

19

and assuming an obligation equivalent to that of the

20

mother that flows from that, even in the absence of a

21

legal relationship, the acknowledgment, the promise to

22

support that would flow from the mother's preexisting

legal relationship with the child.

don't think Congress is required to establish a statutory

scheme on the possibility that someone in the other

category may not live up to the legal responsibilities

that the law prescribes, but in any event, this statute

applies equally as to both categories.
