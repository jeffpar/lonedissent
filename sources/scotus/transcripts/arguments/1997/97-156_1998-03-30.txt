ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. MCCARTHY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MCCARTHY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Some risks are acceptable.

11

We know when we

12

build a major bridge or a tunnel that there are risks of

13

death during the course of construction, despite

14

reasonable precautions, but these risks are acceptable

15

because there are benefits to society and because the

16

workers are not compelled to participate.

17

Ms. Abbott and her supporters believe the risk

18

to the lives of dentists is outweighed by providing in­

19

office treatment to HIV-positive patients without

20

additional precautions.

21

provides service in the face of the risk of death, he

22

should be allowed to take additional precautions.

23

Dr. Bragdon believes that when he

claim of discrimination under the Americans With

2

Disabilities Act when the direct threat provisions are

3

implemented?

4

QUESTION:

Mr. McCarthy, may I ask you to

5

clarify at the outset whether you recognize that once the

6

symptoms are visible, what is now described as AIDS, once

7

a person has that disease, that that would constitute a

8

disability?

9

MR. MCCARTHY:

I think that's very likely, Your

10

Honor, but our position is that the definition applies for

11

disability, and the definition is when there's a physical

12

or mental impairment and here we're talking about HIV,

13

that substantial limits a major life activity, if that

14

comes into play, then the person's disabled, then it seems

15

very likely it would come into play if a person had

16

visible symptoms of HIV disease.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

You concede there is a physical

impairment, or don't you?
MR. MCCARTHY:

I don't --we don't concede that,

20

although we see the force of the respondents' argument on

21

that issue.

22

found that there was no physical impairment and we're

23

unwilling to concede that issue when a circuit court of

24

appeals has made that finding.

25

QUESTION:

We note that the Fourth Circuit in Runnebaum

I thought it was curious that the

1

American Medical Association took the position that it is

2

a physical impairment under the act from the beginning,

3

and the dental association, on the other hand, takes the

4

opposite view.

5

MR. MCCARTHY:

Well, I'm not sure what position

6

the dental association takes with regard to physical

7

impairment.

8

the arguments that we are making in this matter.

9

arguments are directed to disability and -- rather than a

10
11

We don't think that it's really essential to
Our

physical impairment.
There was, it appears to us, a great deal of

12

confusion about those terms in Congress, where Congressmen

13

and women sometimes didn't seem to understand the

14

difference between impairment and disability.

15

QUESTION:

Well, the act seems to go further,

16

and say if someone is regarded as having the impairment

17

it's covered.

18

MR. MCCARTHY:

I think that the language of the

19

act says, if someone is regarded as having such

20

impairment, and when they say such impairment they're

21

referring to an impairment that substantially limits a

22

major life activity, so the regarded as only comes into

23

play if you have an impairment that substantially limits a

24

major life activity.

First Circuit, or -MR. MCCARTHY:

3

Was that point argued in the

In our view it wasn't really

4

argued aggressively, but the issue has appeared.

5

Solicitor General, or the Department of Justice raised it

in the First Circuit.
QUESTION:

Had it been raised in the district

court?
MR. MCCARTHY:

15

I believe the respondent believes

that it has, and the record is somewhat ambiguous on that.
QUESTION:

11
12

The

Really a pretty skimpy record on that

point.
MR. MCCARTHY:

There's a very skimpy record on

that issue.
QUESTION:

But you are contending that a

16

rational Congress would draw the line and exclude from

17

this protection a person whose symptoms are not yet

18

visible, yet include someone who would pose perhaps at

1

least equal danger whose symptoms are visible?

20

MR. MCCARTHY:

No.

We do not think that

21

Congress excluded individuals with HIV disease.

22

that congress defined disability, and you have to meet it.

23

Whether you are symptomatic or not symptomatic, you have

24

to have a physical impairment that substantially limits a

25

major life activity, and our argument goes directly to the

We think

1

statute, and there are certainly -- although there may

2

have been efforts to pass legislation that excluded

3

contagious diseases, they were not successful, and we

4

certainly don't take that position.

5

We take the position that you have to meet the

6

definition, and the reason the issue is raised in a case

7

like this is because this particular individual is a

8

classic example of a person who had no symptoms, no

9

difficulties whatsoever.

The record is very clear on

10

that, that she doesn't have any of the sorts of attributes

11

that are attributed to some asymptomatic and certainly

12

some symptomatic HIV individuals.

13

QUESTION:

Well, do you say that we have to

14

focus on daily public and economic life activities, as

15

oppose to the more private activities that are the --

16

really the basis for the respondent's contention?

17

MR. MCCARTHY:

We get to that language when we

18

look at reproduction as a major life activity, and there

19

are sort of two parts of that, and the first part is,

20

well, this -- how do you get away from the idea that it's

21

so major -- obviously reproduction is so major, it must be

22

a major life activity.

23

And we escape from that argument, we believe

24

successfully, by the fact that Congress already narrowed

25

that definition to what's in the regulation, and I say

1

Congress narrowed it to what's in the regulation because

2

they adopted the language, major life activities, from the

3

1973 act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the 1988 Fair

4

Housing Amendments Act, so it was already in place that

5

major life activities is limited to functions such as

6

living, breathing, working.

7

When we get to that, the question then becomes

8

is reproduction on that list of major life activities, and

9

the reason it isn't is precisely for the reason I think

10

you made inquiry with respect to, Your Honor, and that is,

11

you have to look at the context and purposes of the

12

Americans With Disabilities Act in order to determine what

13

goes on that list, and the context and purposes are, day-

14

to-day independent living and economic self-sufficiency.

15

QUESTION:

Are you relying on the regulations

16

issued by the Department of Justice or those issued by

17

EEOC earlier?

18

MR. MCCARTHY:

We're -- I'm making reference to

19

the Department of Justice title III regulations, but it's

20

also important to make reference in the sense that I just

21

described to the regulations that issued under the

22

Rehabilitation Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act.

QUESTION:

Can I ask -- and are they identical

They are either identical or

essentially identical in that regard.
QUESTION:

2

What function does the Justice

3

Department have under title III, other than issuing

regulations?
MR. MCCARTHY:

mean.

MR. MCCARTHY:
QUESTION:

Do they do anything else under title

III?

They issued the regulations -QUESTION:

7

I'm not sure exactly what you

-- under title III.

Do they administer title III in any

sense?
MR. MCCARTHY:

I'm not aware of the Department

of Justice -QUESTION:

Suppose you have a Congress that's

15

been taken over by the Republicans after 40 years of

16

Democratic control and Democratic judicial appointments

17

and Congress, this Republican Congress does not like the

18

kind of decisions that Democratic judges are going to be

19

making, can Congress say that the interpretation of

20

statutes shall be governed by regulations issued by the

21

Department of Justice?

22

MR. MCCARTHY:

I find that extraordinary.
It certainly was unusual, and we

23

don't -- and we don't really rely on it in that sense.

24

Our reliance comes upon -- comes out of the fact that

life activities, that major life activities was already

2

under a term under the Rehabilitation Act that had already

3

had an existing regulation, so it incorporated that, and

4

there are two -- I think you're making a distinction

5

that's worth noting, if I understand it correctly.
There are two different ways they look at that,

6

7

and one is simply knowing that that language already

8

existed, and the other is attempting to say through the

9

Senate and committee reports that they were adopting that

10

language, and those are two different ways of looking

11

at
QUESTION:

the committee report.

The whole Congress said that through

They attempted to say it through

the committee reports.

QUESTION:

MR. MCCARTHY:

--on those reports.
Oh, no, certainly the whole

8

Congress did not, but the committee reports made that

argument.

20

We're not suggesting that those committee

reports are significant.

22

answer to the question of what role does independent --

23

day-to-day independent living and economic self-

24

sufficiency play in defining what is and what is not a

major life activity, and we think we've in a sense solved

What I'm trying to get at is an

1

the riddle to how do you determine what goes on that list,

2

and the riddle and answer is, you have this principle

3

basis now for deciding what should be on the list, and

4

that is these goals of the Americans With Disabilities

5

Act.

6

Once you have those goals in mind and have this

7

principal basis, you then say a major life activity is a

8

activity which, if substantially limited by a physical or

9

a mental impairment, interferes with the ability to

10

achieve day-to-day independent living and economic self-

11

sufficiency, and when you apply that test you'll find

12

reproduction doesn't fit that list in whatever fashion we

13

describe as reproduction, but learning, hearing, working,

14

breathing do.

15

QUESTION:

If you stipulate that 3 or 4 years

16

hence it is highly likely that major life activities of

17

the kind you've been discussing will be affected, is the

18

person disabled, have disability within the meaning of the

19

act in the first year, when we know that it's inevitable

20

that there will be an effect 3 or 4 years down the line?

21
22

MR. MCCARTHY:

we think of it as inevitable, but recent --

QUESTION:

MR. MCCARTHY:

Well, of course, in a sense it --

Let's assume that it's -But if we assume it's inevitable

1

attempt to affect future disabilities, which is the

2

question that that raises.

3

In fact, I believe the EEOC guidelines for title

4

I specifically say they're not addressing -- and now I

5

can't remember the term -- gene-based disabilities, or

6

disabilities that are going to occur in the future in that

7

sense, and the argument that because you know, almost know

8

for sure you're going to have disabilities later on, you

9

should be classified as disabilities now, I think simply

10
11

goes beyond the statute.
The statute not only defines disabilities in a

12

present sense, but if you open up the statute to future

13

disabilities, then you start looking at hypertension,

14

genetic problems, Huntington's chorea disease, whatever

15

might exist in the future.

16

QUESTION:

But it doesn't mean, does it, the

17

major life activity, that the life activity has to be

18

related to the performance of the job?

19

could be blind.

20

not be -- would be not disabled simply because some jobs

21

don't require seeing.

That doesn't mean the blind person would

QUESTION:

1

If that's correct, then let's take a

2

person who had some eating disorder, or couldn't -- that's

3

not on the list, I don't think, eating disorders, but

4

people are terribly frightened of getting it, so he can't

5

eat except in very, very unusual ways, a very serious

6

problem.

7

Does that fall within the act?
MR. MCCARTHY:

8

9

People are frightened to death of getting it.

I think it's entirely possible

that eating is a major life -QUESTION:

10

Well, I would think so.

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

12

And then if that's so, why isn't

13

reproductive activity, which includes the person having a

14

sex life, I take it -- I mean, you'd think perhaps that

15

that is at least regarded in this society as a major

16

activity, portion of human life.

17

MR. MCCARTHY:

But that argument escapes from

18

the idea that the term major life activities incorporates

19

a definition that's already bounded by the regulation.
QUESTION:

20

eating.

Well, the regulation didn't refer to

I didn't see eating on there.

MR. MCCARTHY:

QUESTION:

No.

if

7

you're willing to put in things that relate to feeling,

things that relate to eating, things that relate to those

things which are part of our ordinary human life,

and if

10

you also say that sexual activity is an ordinary part of

list HIV as a physical or mental impairment.
MR. MCCARTHY:

2

And it almost certainly is a

3

physical or mental impairment, but a physical or mental

4

impairment is different than a disability, and we know

5

that it's classified, probably classified as a physical

6

impairment, certainly if you follow the regulations, but

7

the question is, is it a disability, and we get to -- in

8

order for it to be a disability, it has to be a physical

9

impairment that substantially limits a major life

10

activity.
QUESTION:

11

You're saying -- you're -- you're

referring, when you keep referring to the examples in the

MR. MCCARTHY:

In a sense.

They go to

2

sustaining oneself, and reproduction is outside that --

3

doesn't fit with the list.

4

here are the -- and of course that's a loose way of

5

referring to it, but the whole idea here is, we're given

6

this regulation that says what major life activities are,

7

and it defines it in terms of examples, and one must

8

understand why the examples are there to know what else

9

goes on the list.

10

QUESTION:

I mean the -- sort of the game

What about sustaining oneself, the

11

words you just used, including access to ordinary health

care like going to the dentist?

13

regularly than you or I, needs access to medical

monitoring?

MR. MCCARTHY:

This -- a person who has

I think it's arguable that if a

person has a serious disease and the present medical

regimen would include more visits to the office than

MR. MCCARTHY:

I think that's correct, that

the -- you can't get at what is a disability by what is

5

allegedly discrimination, but what I was trying to get at

6

is, we're now talking about reproduction as a -- we're now

7

talking about caring for oneself as a major life activity,

8

and we know it is a major life activity because it's on

9

the list, and the AMA tries to put health care services

10

under that, and our first argument is it really doesn't

belong there.

MR. MCCARTHY:

But the part that I was

getting -- attempting to get at was there is -- you're not

The other part of the major life activity

argument that I wanted to get at is the idea, this idea of

the principal basis in day-to-day independent living and

economic self-sufficiency being the guide.

reproduction doesn't fit within that group is, people who

But even if you put -- and I realize

you're not doing it, but even if you put reproduction

6

let's say, a person who is infertile and a person who

7

simply has HIV.

8

MR. MCCARTHY:

9

QUESTION:

10

Ultimately you do, yes.

Yes.

MR. MCCARTHY:

And what is that distinction?
Well, if we're talking about HIV,

11

the first question is, is it an impairment, and the

12

regulation suggests that it is an impairment, and when

13

we're talking about whether it substantially limits a

14

major life activity, like being impotent or like being

15

infertile, it has no relationship to this concept of day-

16

to-day independent living.

17

Yes, but let's assume we get over

18

that point and we classify this as one of the activities

19

that does, in fact, belong within the series of examples.

MR. MCCARTHY:

Reproduction?
I understood you to make a

courts should normally defer to the reasonable medical

judgments of public health officials.

3

On those standards, assuming, as I think is

4

correct, after 15 years and hundreds of thousands of

5

people dead as a result of this disease, I gather after 15

6

years and hundreds of thousands of deaths, there isn't one

hundreds of thousands of dentists who do treat AIDS

patients, there isn't one case in which one of those

dentists documentedly caught AIDS from a patient.
Now, if that's so, how could we say here that

11

13

MR. MCCARTHY:

Well, there are two parts to that

I have not thought that

And then -- and then, Section

Attorney General to adopt regulations to implement Title

Now, one of the regulations that has been

carried over verbatim, as we were talking about, from the

8

previous regulations, and one that was very much before

Congress because it was quoted, set out in this Court's

opinion in the Arline case, is the definition of physical

impairment, to include any physiological disorder or

condition affecting the hemic or lymphatic systems.

that of course includes HIV infection, as the current

burner, may I ask -- as I understand it, there's no

Yes, that is correct.

And so the only question is whether

some physical impairments that are not disabilities.

18

there are two further questions once it -- it is

and the second is whether it substantially limits that

That, in the very same regulation that I quoted, is really

implicit in that regulation.

3

as a disorder or condition that, among other things,

affects the reproductive system, it is hard to see how

that would have any relevance unless reproduction were a

major life activity, a substantial limitation of which

Since reproductive disease is an impairment,

the -- affecting the ability to reproduce is a disability,

in that automatically the ability to reproduce is a major

because they mention the reproductive system along with

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that

is just one indication, perhaps not a conclusive

indication, but it certainly looks in the direction of

concern about impairment to the reproductive system.
Now, the Court of Appeals approached this

But if the health care worker follows the universal

QUESTION:

So then it would seem to me the

answer to the question is that this doesn't have to be

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the -- the question of

disclosure really is not addressed by this Act.

MR. WALLACE:

There's -- there's nothing in the

Act that I'm aware of that addresses that question.
QUESTION:

Well, let's assume that that would be

a discrimination under the Act.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it's very close to the

21

question that the Court had in Arline, in which you tried

22

to specify some standards to be used to be sure that there

23

24

handicapped individuals within the meaning of the Act, and

found here by the Court of Appeals, after a very careful

review of the evidence, would be used to hold the person

unqualified for protection, because the Act is an

anti-discrimination act, which could be undermined if each

Both the District Court and the

For the Respondent.

And that was

upheld by the Court of Appeals.

Right.

It wasn't at trial, but introduced it in
response to the motion for summary judgment.

claims of violation of the Americans with Disabilities

Act, and have lost every time.
