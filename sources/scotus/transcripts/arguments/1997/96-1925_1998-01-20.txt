ORAL ARGUMENT OF COLUMBUS R. GANGEMI

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11
12

MR. GANGEMI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue for consideration, in a nutshell, is

13

whether it is lawful for an employer and a union to agree

14

that the employer shall pay the wages of a union official,

15

or union officials, for their services as union officials,

16

where the union official used to be an employee of the

17

payor employer.

18

Our position is, is that under section 302 of

19

the Labor Management Relations Act and a fair reading of

20

the plain language of that statute, such an arrangement is

21

clearly unlawful.

22

This Court in Arroyo many years ago said that a

23

literal reading of the language of the statute does no

24

offense -- does no violence, I believe the term was -- to

25

common sense and so I believe it is useful at the

1

threshold to consider for a moment what common sense would

2

suggest is the answer to the question in light of what we

3

all know to be bedrock Federal labor policy and that is,

4

is that notwithstanding the fact that ultimately there is

5

an economic interdependence between labor and management,

6

that the relationship is to be maintained as one of

7

adversarial independence.

8

9

In light of that fundamental policy that has
been expressed by this Court on numerous occasions, from

10

insurance agents on forward, to ask the question, is it

11

lawful for an employer to pay a union official for his

12

services as a union official is to answer the question.

13

QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you this,

14

Mr. Gangemi, do you think the wage payments would be

15

lawful if the employees actually worked for the employer

16

an hour a day and the rest of the time for the union?

17

MR. GANGEMI:

I believe that the statute

18

provides that an employer may pay for the services of that

19

individual as an employee, but may not pay --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. GANGEMI:

22

23

For the hour a day.
For the hour that he works as an

employee of the employer, but for the -QUESTION:

So on the no-docking arrangements,

24

you think a fortiori they would be invalid, where there's

25

been full pay but only part work for the employer.

MR. GANGEMI:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. GANGEMI:

No, Your Honor.

No?
I believe that to understand

4

whether or not a payment is lawful under a no-docking

5

arrangement one must go to the safe harbor language of the

6

8(a)(2) proviso of the National Labor Relations Act, which

7

is from whence the no-docking provision gets its genesis.

8

That language, that section says that notwithstanding

9

anything else, it -- an employer shall not be prohibited

10

from permitting an employee to confer with him during

11

regular hours without loss of pay.
QUESTION:

12

That isn't all -- that isn't all that

13

a shop steward does, unfortunately.

14

appealing to plain language, that would allow the shop

15

steward to be paid only for the time that he spends

16

conferring with the employer and not with consulting the

17

employees who have grievances, and so forth.
MR. GANGEMI:

18

I mean, if you're

The board and the courts have

19

extended that language, rightly or wrongly, to include

20

conferring with each other, conferring with fellow

21

employees, in preparation for or in conjunction with

22

conferring with management.
QUESTION:

Okay.

QUESTION:

-- conferring with other employees

2

and with the employer.

3

MR. GANGEMI:

Again, Your Honor, it depends on

4

the nature of the relationship.

6

full-time agent, or to the extent that he is acting as an

7

officer of the union --

11

QUESTION:

If a steward has ceased

I don't know what you mean, to the

extent that he's acting as an officer.

He spends his full

time on union work.
MR. GANGEMI:

Your Honor, I do not think the

12

distinction is one of full-time versus part-time.

13

the distinction is, is he being paid for his services as a

14

union official, which is unlawful, or is he being paid for

15

his services as an employee, which is lawful.

16

QUESTION:

I think

But that's not the -- I mean, you

17

acknowledge that if he's conferring with the employer on a

18

grievance, that isn't spending his time as an employee of

19

the employer.

20

isn't it, and you concede that that is payable.

21

That's spending his time as a union member,

MR. GANGEMI:

Section 8, the proviso -- Your

22

Honor, the proviso to section 8(a)(2) creates, in our

23

view, a safe harbor --

the harbor?

Is it enough that the steward does nonunion

MR. GANGEMI:

Again, Your Honor, in our judgment

6

the distinction is not the issue -- the issue is not

7

whether the individual works full-time or part-time.

8

you look at the statutory language, it says nothing about

9

whether someone is full-time or part-time.

Is it enough to make him an employee

that he works for the employer 15 minutes a day?
MR. GANGEMI:

Your Honor, I do not think so.

19

do not think that working for a few moments a day for an

20

employer --

21

QUESTION:

Okay.

I

What is the line you're

22

drawing, because I -- I frankly -- I think it's in my view

23

crucial to your case that the no-docking rules are not

24

cast aside, and the Government has really portrayed your

25

argument as an attack upon that.

You say it's not an

attack upon that.

2

MR. GANGEMI:

3

QUESTION:

That's --

I want to know how much of the noÂ­

4

docking law remains.

5

has to be for the employer and he ceases to be an employee

6

if he's not spending most of his time for the employer as

7

opposed to the union?
MR. GANGEMI:

8

9

The majority of the employee's time

I do not think that section

8(a)(2) proviso is a matter of the amount of time.

I

10

believe, and we argue, that it is a function of the nature

11

of the activity that the representative of the union, the

12

employee, is engaging in.
QUESTION:

13

He's engaging in two types of

14

activities.

15

it is as a shop steward, which is not for the employer,

16

okay.

Some of it is for the employer, and some of

He's doing both.

MR. GANGEMI:

MR. GANGEMI:

20

The analysis would be --

And your answer is?
My answer is, is that you go to

the statutory language --

Right.

MR. GANGEMI:

And under 302 (c) (1) he cannot be

QUESTION:

Yes?

2

MR. GANGEMI:

You then go to section 8(a)(2) and

3

if the nature of the activity falls within the ambit of

conduct.

concern.

I have no idea how to answer that question.

You're saying it depends on whether he's really

MR. GANGEMI:

17

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, I --

He's spending all his time as a shop

18

steward and you say you cannot tell me whether that makes

19

him an employee of the employer or of the union.

MR. GANGEMI:

If an individual is spending all

21

of his time and has ceased to -- has ceased to engage in

MR. GANGEMI:

Is that arrangement -- shop steward works 4

them, so it adds up to a total of 8 hours a day, are those

I believe that that type of provision is qualitatively

different from the 4.6 that is at issue here wherein the

MR. GANGEMI:

QUESTION:

There must have been some kind of

judgment that it was legal.

9

MR. GANGEMI:

I think that's an untoward

assumption, that -- or an unjustified assumption, I should

say, Your Honor.
It is very easy to be lulled into a belief that,

13

you know, if you pay a part-timer, or if you pay a shop

steward, you should be able to pay a regular union rep,

that sense that there is no difference when in fact there

is.

MR. SIL3ERMAN:

11
12

Very well, Mr. Gangemi.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

13

Discussion to this point I think has made quite

14

clear that there is no principle basis for distinguishing

15

a collective bargaining agreement that provides an

16

employee who assumes a union position part time off to

17

perform those duties from one that provides full time off,

18

and - QUESTION:

19

Well, one principle I think has been

20

suggested.

It didn't get very far in the argument here

21

but at least, as I understand it, this principle was

22

suggested, that in fact the language in, what is it,

23

(c)(1) was in fact added in an effort to in effect

24

equalize the position of those who are working for an

25

affiliated union and an unaffiliated union.

But the point was to allow, how ill-defined it

2

may have been, some no-docking practice for all of them.

3

Whatever that means, and however facially inconsistent

4

that might be with the general prohibition, it was at

5

least something less than 100 percent of one's time and a

6

payment of 100 percent of one's salary for that time and

7

that, at least on the basis of legislative intent, in

8

construing an ill-drafted statute we should recognize the

9

basic distinction between no docking for some work and

10

full payment for no work for the employer.

11

that distinction?
MR. SILBERMAN:

12

What about

Well, Justice Souter, first, as

13

a historical matter, at the time the statute was enacted

14

there was as much evidence of no -- of payment of the type

15

we had here, where it was recognized that an employee

16

would have full time off to perform certain union

17

functions, representational functions, as part-time

18

positions.

QUESTION:

Can I find that in the record?

industrial unions began in the automotive industry, so

8

this was certainly the lead industry.

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SILBERMAN:

10

And this was specific -- this

11

industry's practice was specifically called to the

12

attention of the 1947 Congress, both the Ford contract,

13

which was a de jure full-time contract and the Chrysler

14

contract which, as we explained in our brief, was de facto

15

full time in that employees were given as much time as

16

they needed and, in fact, the chief steward spent full

time.

18

QUESTION:

What is the significance of having

19

these practices "called to the attention" of the 1947

20

Congress?

MR. SILBERMAN:

Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, I

22

was -- I thought I understood Justice Souter to be

suggesting that a distinction could be drawn between part

time and full time based on historical practice, and that

you could understand the statute as only going as far as

history had taken it, and I'm suggesting that that doesn't

2

provide a basis for distinction.

3

Obviously, the ultimate answer to the question

4

here is going to turn on the language and structure of

this statute as informed by its history.

You can draw a distinction based on

nothing turns on that in terms of interpreting this

that an employee who is on leave to take an educational --

20

pursue a college education or is on sabbatical, that the

21

22

same definition as for the purpose of NRA.

people are employees, but since the statute here is

is they are current employees even though the company has

no control over their --

13

MR. SILBERMAN:

That's right.

We would not say

14

they are currently rendering service to the employer as an

15

employee, but if the question is, do they have the status

16

of an employee, you would answer that in the affirmative.

17

But as I say, whether they are employees or former

18

employees, we turn to this statutory language and the

19

statutory structure to understand the structure --

20

QUESTION:

But the point wouldn't be whether

21

they're an employee.

What is crucial is whether these --

22

whether the company is paying them as compensation for his

that the company is paying while he's on leave is

5

payment is payment by reason of service as an employee

6

just as, in the Bingler case in the tax context, this

7

Court had no trouble saying that an employee who was on

8

full-time leave to pursue a degree, and he's drawing pay

9

from his employer, was getting that pay by reason of his

10
11

service as an employee.
QUESTION:

No, but what that boils down to

12

saying is, he gets it simply because the only people they

13

have contracted to pay it to are those who have the status

14

of employee and therefore the entire issue becomes one of

15

whether the employer has, in fact, recognized this as

16

something it would like or is willing to do to an

17

employee, and that's the substance of it.

QUESTION:

No, I think that's -- I don't think

that is fair.

There's nothing -- the prohibition, the

broad prohibition is a prohibition on payments of money to

Saying that this is what -- how

this system evolved, and it was very well-evolved at the

the district court, having found that these were not?

3

MR. SILBERMAN:

First, Justice Breyer, I don't

4

believe there are any district court findings that bear on

5

the subject at all.

6

this is essentially a legal question we're discussing.

7

We have some legal conclusions, and

And I -- our answer is that we understand the

8

phrase compensation for or by reason of service to cover

9

any payment that is made to someone who is or has been an

10

employee of the employer, and that is a payment that is

11

provided in return for services that were provided to the

12

employer.

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, here they say this

is not in return for services that were provided to the

This is in return for services that are being

no, that is not the case, that these are -- it is true

that one of the conditions to receive these payments is

20

that you must perform these services as a union

21

representative, just as in an educational leave situation

one of the conditions to receive that money is that you

1

precisely, I believe, the reason you indicated in your

2

earlier question, that this is only paid to employees and

3

is paid as part of service to an employee, and I would say

4

that if there are any questions about the language, and

5

certainly one thing that I think has to be clear 60

6

years -- 40 -- 50 years after the statute was enacted it

7

can hardly be said that this language plainly and

8

unmistakably condemns a practice that nobody has thought

9

was illegal for 50 years.
If there's any doubt about what the language

10
11

means -QUESTION:

12

Well, nobody.

The court of appeals

13

though it was illegal till they changed their mind, didn't

14

they?

15

MR. SILBERMAN:

There was -- there were -- the

16

Trailways court held that a particular kind of agreement,

17

not necessarily this agreement, there are a number of

18

courts the other way -- certainly the parties to

19

collective bargaining have been negotiating these things

20

for 50 years without anybody thinking that there was a

21

legal problem.

22

QUESTION:

But on the other side of that

23

argument is a principle that exceptions to a statutory

provision are to be construed narrowly.

1

that that -- whether that principle necessarily applies to

2

a criminal statute.

3

for two reasons.

4

I think it's particularly inapt here

The first is, as I was saying earlier, we have

5

some exceptions to this statute that are crafted in a way

6

to indicate that Congress was making the kinds of

7

legislative and policy judgments that Congress makes in

8

treating with this -- with the subjects of welfare funds

9

and the subject of dues check off in that way.

10

These are much more categorical exceptions which

11

bespeak an effort to pull the entire area outside of the

12

ambit of this criminal statute and leave it for treatment

13

under other law.

14

The second critical point here is that we have

15

very clear legislative history.

16

practices were called to Congress' intention.

17

QUESTION:

These provisions, these

practices were called to its attention.

Here Congress is making substantial

MR. SILBERMAN:

So what?

Well, Justice Rehnquist, let me

22

try to impress you in the following two respects.

First,

23

that we know that this -- in 1947 those who were making

24

these changes were not at all shy about saying this

25

practice that's going on today in collective bargaining is

1

illegal, it's illegitimate, we're trying to change it, and

2

they made that very clear about a number of types of

3

collective bargaining agreements.

4

suggest that this practice was something they were trying

5

to reach.

6

They said nothing to

Perhaps even more important, at the very same

7

time that Congress did that, they enacted the changes to

8

section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act to

9

provide essentially a rule of equality whose purpose, the

10

legislative history tells us, was precisely to allow

11

company unions the same privilege that unions like the UAW

12

already enjoyed under the law to negotiate for lost time

13

arrangements of this sort.

14

QUESTION:

May I ask you just one factual

15

question before your time runs out?

16

in your brief and the Government brief seem clearly to

refer to no-docking arrangements.

It's the strongest example,

Justice Stevens, of this being called to Congress'

attention.

The absence of any congressional response and

establish the legislative intent not to proscribe these

The

It's because the board has held that it

QUESTION:

No, but they're current payments to

current employees for services being performed currently,

preserve the pension benefits of people who work for the

So you're right about the language with respect

to the part-time people, but I'm not so sure you're right

about it with regard to the full-time people.

This only applies to grievance

It wouldn't apply to other union officials?
MS. BRINKMANN:

It would be a very different

inquiry in different circumstances, Your Honor.

13

this is a clear case not only because of this close --

because of this close nexus we do think that.

We think

QUESTION:

Well, if, in fact, you were to

prevail here, would that reasoning that allows you to

prevail also permit the employer to pay for a full-time

employee who is the negotiator for the union in respect to

the collective bargaining agreement?

20

MS. BRINKMANN:

It's certainly one --we would

21

be looking at that.

something that an employer bargains to pay for, which in

the grievance context the answer is yes.

MS. BRINKMANN:

The fact is, Your Honor,

experience shows that there's far less reason to believe

that that is by reason of their service.

there's every reason to believe it.

In this case,

Is there anything in that that --

Your Honor, when we looked at

the case on Caterpillar petitioner had not requested a

remand at that point, and we don't --we believe that

those would be additional factors that could be looked

into to see if there was some kind of sham compensation or

My understanding of the

collective bargaining agreement is that was not to be paid

for.

19

The terms of the collective bargaining agreement

20

omitted paying for negotiation of vacation, things that

21

were not directly related to its office, so the way in

22

which this case comes to the court, I believe it's a

declaratory judgment action, that payments under that

collective bargaining agreement are per se a violation of

QUESTION:

It seems to me that your reference to

the collective bargaining agreement and the inclusion of

the compensation in part of those negotiations cuts

4

against you as much as for you.

5

I should have thought that the very purpose of

this statute was to eliminate this from the collective

bargaining context so that the union could not make

demands that its officials be compensated.

MS. BRINKMANN:

It seems to me that works very much

The whole purpose of this is to take this

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, we don't believe so.

14

Again, there is this -- 302(c) was enacted against this

15

whole backdrop of the National Labor Relations Act which

16

had already been enacted and was amended at the same time,

17

and now provides for unfair labor practices civil

penalties, not criminal sanctions.

19
20
21

302(a) is a broad criminal prohibition against
employers paying union officials.
302(c)(1) is the first exception, carving out an

22

exception recognizing that employers and employees have a

different relationship.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF COLUMBUS R. GANGEMI

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. GANGEMI:

The bottom line, both respondent

4

and the United States conflate the concept of service with

5

the concept of the status of a prior employee.

6

statute allows the employer to pay for the services of an

7

individual as an employee.

8

and the union to agree to pay someone to be a union

9

official because of their former status as an employee of

10

The

It does not allow the company

the employer.

11

The statute sets up a clear dichotomy.

12

pay a union official to be an employee, but you cannot pay

13

an employee to be a union official, and it makes a mockery

14

of that dichotomy for the company and the union to -- or

15

for the union to argue here that you can override that

16

dichotomy by declaring one to be the other, by declaring

17

service as an employ -- service as a union official to be

18

and payment for it to be a benefit for having been an

19

employee of the employer in the past.

20

You can

It collapses, or conflates those two very

21

distinct concepts which the statute recognized, that you

could have a dual capacity employee.
