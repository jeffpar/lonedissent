ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q. WOLFSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WOLFSON:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1982,

10

the United States and about 200 other

11

parties settled complex land litigation by agreeing that

12

the title to the disputed lands would be quieted in the

13

United States and that the defendants would receive

14

substantial sums which they stipulated in the consent

15

judgment were fair and just compensation for their claims.
Over a decade later,

16

the respondents sought to

17

nullify that settlement agreement.

18

public documents in the National Archives showed that the

19

disputed lands on Horn Island had been granted to a

20

private claimant by the Spanish colonial authorities in

21

1781.

22

They contended that

The district court dismissed their challenge to

23

the consent judgment as untimely, and also stated that

24

there was little evidence of fraud or mistake to support

25

their challenge on the merits, but the court of appeals

1

agreed with the respondent that the consent judgment

2

should be set aside, and it also held that the Spanish

3

grant was valid, and it awarded title in the disputed

4

lands to the respondents.

5

The court of appeals decision contravenes

6

important values of finality, repose, and stability in the

7

law which are at their apex in litigation over titles to

8

land, and the lower court's errors also have broad

9

significance for the stability of title to both public and

10

11

private lands.
First, the court of appeals disregarded basic

12

principles of finality of judgments and sovereign immunity

13

when it allowed this case to go forward.

14

QUESTION:

Incidentally -- and I want you to

15

keep on this vein so far as I'm concerned, but do you have

16

to -- in order to prevail, do you have to convince us both

17

of the sovereign immunity point and of the statute of

18

limitations point under the Quiet Title Act?

19

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, they both -- there are

20

two - - I have to turn to the statute of - - the QTA, the

21

Quiet Title Act for a minute.

22

immunity ground, then I think that the quiet title action

23

can't really go anywhere because we would indisputedly

24

have title to the lands.

25

question --

If we win on the sovereign

QUESTION:

2

the settlement, or something.

3

Well, what if they want to set aside

MR. WOLFSON:

I don't -- my -- our position is

4

that the Quiet Title Act would not allow a - - would not

5

allow the settlement to be set aside.

6

I mean, if the -- let's assume that they could

7

get into district court under the Quiet Title Act because

8

the court of appeals said yes, the statute of limitations

9

was tolled.

10

Immediately, we would move for summary judgment

11

or to move to dismiss their claim because it's -- the

12

judgment held - - as a matter of res judicata definitively

13

gave us title, and in the Quiet Title Act, in fact,

14

there's a provision that says that the plaintiff has to

15

set out with particularity the nature of his right title

16

or interest in the disputed lands, as well as the United

17

States, and it would be, I think, a complete defense to

18

any action under the Quiet Title Act that the judgment in

19

the prior action had conclusively found -- determined that

20

title were in the United States.

21

Now, that is -- it may be a separate question

22

from the statute of limitations question under the Quiet

23

Title Act as to --

is this about equitable tolling, statute of limitations?

2

Why didn't the Government just say claim preclusion?

3

already had a quiet title action.

4

MR. WOLFSON:

We

Well, I mean, we of course -- it

5

has to be understood in the district court the respondents

6

relied on the quiet title action -- on the Quiet Title Act

7

not really -- they didn't really want title to the land

8

back.

9

wanted money, and there's various pleadings in the

10
11

They didn't really want their land back.

They

district court in which they say that.
What they said, Your Honor, was that the Quiet

12

Title Act allowed the district court to award them damages

13

because there is a provision that says if it's found that

14

it's their land but -- under the Quiet Title Act, but we

15

elect to keep it anyway, then we can elect to award them

16

compensation.

17

Our argument in the district court was that the

18

district court could not use the Quiet Title Act on that

19

basis because it was essentially a taking claim which had

20

to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims.

21

Now, we went up to the --

22

QUESTION:

Even apart from that, why don't you,

23

as to damages, also have res judicata to plead?

24

they acquired it, there was a judgment, it was so many

25

dollars, and that dollar judgment is it.

Preclusion for that reason.
I have to emphasize that the

No, but what's the answer to my

question?
MR. WOLFSON:

I think that -- well, I think that

if we win on the first question presented, then we have

9

those defenses to plead, but if we lose on the first

10

question presented -QUESTION:

11

But do you say you have that defense

12

to plead not only with respect to the party in whom title

13

has been adjudicated, but that you also have that defense

14

to plead with respect to the amount of money that could

15

possibly be a liability from the Government to the

16

respondents?

I

1

understood you to say, well, the issue really under the

2

Quiet Title Act is not title.

3

my question is, why isn't that also a matter of

4

preclusion, because the damages were the subject of a

5

prior settlement that was reduced to judgment?
MR. WOLFSON:

6

The issue is damages.

And

Right, and my - - I guess what I

7

have to say is, it's an answer that we can give only if

8

that judgment remains closed.

9

QUESTION:

Well, but the judgment remains

10

closed, I presume, because you have won on the first

11

issue.
MR. WOLFSON:

12

Right.

If we win on the first

1

summary judgment, and the district court dismissed it as

2

untimely, which should be reviewed in the court of

3

appeals, I would think, under an abuse of discretion

4

standard, so we strongly feel that we had no call to even

5

address these matters.
It was only when the court of appeals, even

6

7

while excusing the respondents for their 12-year delay in

8

bringing their suit, rushed to the, you know, ultimate

9

merits of the case, reopened the judgment, concluded that

10

everything -- that the land claim was valid, and awarded

11

title to the respondents, that we had to face the issue

12

about whether the Quiet Title Act could be a basis for

13

awarding the title into the respondents' land.

14

I think that that does focus - - return me to my

15

point about why the court of appeals' decisions -- why its

16

rulings are so important.

17

finality of judgments and sovereign immunity, the court of

18

appeals essentially redetermined land title issues in a

19

litigation against the United States that was a collateral

20

attack on a final judgment where there was no waiver of

21

sovereign immunity that would permit such a case to go

22

forward.

First, I mean, in terms of

23

Second, when the court of appeals, on the issue

24

of whether there is tolling of the statute of limitations

25

should be tolled, I think it disregarded two very-

2

important policies about statute of limitations, both

3

generally in the law and especially with regard to land

4

title litigation:

forced to come into court to defend against stale, very

6

stale land claims, and also to encourage plaintiffs who

claim an interest in land to conduct prompt and thorough

research on their claims.

kind of prematurely judging the merits of the case.

11

we submit, was error because it was -- first of all

12

because it was outside of the scope of the court of

13

appeals.

14

QUESTION:

That,

Is it your position the court of

15

appeals was wrong in saying that the independent action

16

was just really a continuation of the earlier action?

17
18

MR. WOLFSON:

Yes, it is.

I think that's --

that is essentially our primary submission.

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

Certainly an independent action

20

is possible under the rules, isn't it, because it says

21

that - MR. WOLFSON:

22

Right.

I mean, I would say this.

23

The rules leave any independent action where they found

24

it.

25

abridge or modify or enlarge any substantive right, and

That is, they do not -- the rules, of course, do not

1

all that -- when Rule 60(b) says there may be an

2

independent action, it doesn't purport to create one, or

3

establish what the substantive law would be for proceeding

4

under one.

5

All it says is, if, under some other body of

6

substantive law there is available to a party an

7

independent action that would allow that party relief from

8

a final judgment, the rules leave that where -- you know,

9

leave that there.

10

What the rules themselves do, however, is they

11

eliminated a kind of a borderland of ancillary forms of

12

action that were neither really inside nor exactly outside

13

the original litigation, that were available in the 19th

14

Century, before law and equity were united in the Federal

15

Rules in 1938 and, as we've explained, there was

16

considerable confusion between 1938 and 1946 as to whether

17

still one could go outside the mechanism that the rules

18

had set up, which was to say, to file a motion for relief

19

from judgment.

20

The reason why I think there was confusion was

21

that as it was originally enacted, Rule 60(b) did not

22

specifically say that a party could get relief from a

23

final judgment because of fraud, and I think there was

24

some speculation that it couldn't have been that the rules

25

had intended to cut off that avenue from relief.

the
QUESTION:

2

Right on that point, supposing -- I

3

know it's not this case, but supposing there had been

4

allegations of fraud here, would there need to be an

5

independent jurisdictional basis for attacking the

6

judgment on fraud grounds?

7

MR. WOLFSON:

Yes, because they're outside the

8

time limit of Rule 60(b), which is 1 year for seeking

9

relief from a final judgment based on fraud, whether

10

intrinsic or extrinsic, as the rule specifically says,

11

so - QUESTION:

12

13

But the sentence describing

independent actions includes fraud as a ground of relief.

14

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, there may be -- there may be

15

some substantive law -- for example, between private

16

parties is one that would come to mind, where one party

17

could seek to - - could bring a lawsuit in Federal district

18

court against another and get relief from a final judgment

19

based on fraud, but when such an independent action is

20

filed in Federal district court,

1

Well, I think -- I mean, we're drawing our reasoning from

2

the Court's recent decision in Kokkonen.

QUESTION:

Yes, but there's no pre-Kokkonen law

that establishes that?

How about that it would undercut

QUESTION:

I think that's right.

-- avoid 60(b) and say, here, we - -

MR. WOLFSON:

Right.

It is truly ancillary

QUESTION:

So --

20

MR. WOLFSON:

-- and I think it would be hard to

21

understand why the drafters of the Federal Rules would

have put in a 1-year time limit for relief from judgment,

motions for relief from judgment based on fraud, among

24

other things, and mistake, if it had -- were also possible

But then it's also puzzling why did

they use the word fraud in subparagraph (3), or clause

MR. WOLFSON:

from fraud perpetrated upon it, but it is a unique and

very, very narrow situation that involves egregious

misconduct like bribing a juror.

6

QUESTION:

Why do you think that?

It

That is, I

7

don't understand the relation of the first parts of the

8

rules to the word independent action.

9

My understanding is there was a classical action

10

in equity called an independent action in equity, and that

11

classical action which existed in the Nineteenth Century

12

was a way of going to a court of equity and asking for

13

relief from a judgment, and you could get it.

14

MR. WOLFSON:

15

QUESTION:

Well --

And if there was a jurisdictional

16

problem, there was no problem, because you went to the

17

same court and they let you in in the same court that you

had the original action in.

MR. WOLFSON:

I think that --

So I grant you, I agree with you, I

don't understand the relation to that.

these independent actions in equity was to set aside an

as to the second, and moreover, since an action in equity,

Well, I think that if -- looking

at those cases, they really -- although they are referred

to as independent actions in equity they really are

devices that courts of equity were trying to fashion in

not reopen its judgments after a few months, and -QUESTION:

15

Well, in Missouri Pacific the second

action was brought as a matter -- in a matter of months,

17

after the original decision came down from this Court,

18

wasn't it?

19

MR. WOLFSON:

Right, and that's -- and in

20

Missouri Pacific there had been a problem because there

21

was no longer complete diversity among the parties, and

the Court said -- now -- said yes, you know, the parties

can go forward.

24

We think that Missouri Pacific is really best
understood as a fraud upon the court case, but if not,

then it probably is best understood as a bill of review

12

MR. WOLFSON:

13

we are back in the 19th Century.

14

the Court is using the term, independent action, it means

15

a new lawsuit, but even if we're back in the 19th Century,

16

I mean, what I think we were talking about is, if there is

17

subject matter jurisdiction and all of the rest of it and

18

you can go and bring a new lawsuit -- for example, parties

19

with diversity of citizenship who go into Federal court to

20

enjoin the effect of a State court judgment, that is a

21

classic independent action in equity, but it would need

all of the requisites of what anybody would need when they

were filing a new case in Federal court.

1

that were available then, if they could have been brought

2

without a new basis of Federal jurisdiction you can't

3

argue, I don't believe, that substituting a category of

4

independent action for all of those limited the court's

5

jurisdiction, because the rules are not intended to change

jurisdiction.

In other words, if there were juris -- you

didn't need new jurisdiction under one of those writs, you

don't need it today if this is the substitute for that.

to make a motion under the rules, and the advisory

On the point about Power's Heirs, which I want

to get to, the Court -- the respondents did not mention

Power's Heirs either in the lower court, and Professor

5

Baade's affidavit, which purports to be a comprehensive

examination of this Court's 1 th Century decisions on the

issue, does not address -- you know, does not discuss

8

Power's Heirs at all, even though it is a - - it is a
controlling decision of Federal law that goes to the

10

ultimate issue on the merits in this case, which is

11

whether the United States obtained title to the lands in

12

the Louisiana Purchase or whether they were -- had already

13

been alienated out of the public domain at that time.

14

Now, two points on how the court of appeals

15

disposed on the case.

16

think that the court of appeals acted outside the scope of

17

appellate jurisdiction under section 12 1 when it reached

18

the ultimate issue in the case.

First, as I mentioned earlier, we

Even if we're wrong on the first two questions

20

presented, or even the first one, and even if the judgment

21

of dismissal was incorrect in the case - - you know, that

22

dismissal should have been reversed -- it seems to me that

23

what the court of appeals should have done was simply

remand the case to the district court for further

proceedings.

The district court did not really look at any of

1

2

the merits issues in this case.

3

that had already been decided already, and all the

4

district court really said about the case was, well, I

5

don't believe that the respondents have brought forth

6

evidence of fraud or mistake that would justify setting

7

aside the judgment even in the alternative, and on that

8

basis it denied the respondents' motion for summary

j udgment.

10

I mean, it thought that

Now, that denial of the motion for summary

11

judgment was not a final decision.

12

have been appealable by itself, and it didn't merge -- the

13

courts often talk about an interlocutory decision merging

14

into the final judgment, and I would submit that it did

15

not merge into the final judgment because it did not in

16

any way affect the ultimate way in which the district

17

court disposed of the case, which was to dismiss for lack

18

of jurisdiction.

19

It certainly wouldn't

So when the court of appeals reversed the

20

dismissal and said the case can go forward, the case was

21

essentially just where it had been in the district court,

22

which was a tentative conclusion that the case should

not -- should go to trial.

Yes, Your Honor.
Without any time limit on doing that?
The limitation that's applicable to

Laches says

that as long as a party is diligent in pursuing his rights

Of course, Your Honor, they do have

QUESTION:

And if the second part simply

part make sense?
MR. TAYLOR:

6

I disagree with your premise, Your

7

Honor, that it swallows the first part.

I believe in

8

order to bring an independent action you've got to show

9

the five elements to bring an independent action that are

10

listed in the Banker's Mortgage case, and that there are

11

more stringent requirements for bringing an independent

12

action after the year has run than are required for

13

bringing the other 60(b) motion within a year.

14

QUESTION:

I think you could reconcile them if

15

you reserve the independent action for particularly

egregious frauds, of which my reading of the Dorasavage

If you're trying to find a difference

between the two, 60(b) is what you use to reopen a

The independent

could bring that any place, not the -- you're not limited

12

to the court that rendered the judgment.

MR. TAYLOR:

14

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
So wouldn't that make sense, the

difference between the two?

that entered the judgment, and if you have 60(b), then you

can't end-run it, and 60(b) has a time limit for mistake,

why you may go into a circuit court as well as an original

Presumably the original court is available, and

I understand what you're saying, and that is that there is

a distinction, because you can go into a separate court

there, rather than filing -- and filing a motion, you

cannot.

9

But I suggest to the Court that the provisions
for an independent action here preserve those equitable

10

grounds that existed in the 19th Century, which was to

11

give the court discretion to have some flexibility in

12

setting aside a judgment when a wrong has been done, the

13

party has been diligent that presented it, and that to

14

weigh those equities and to make an adjustment, as all of

a misrepresentation, let us say as - - I want to say as

small as the one that seems to be at issue here, but

and it was pure mistake, and the court reversed it and

2

corrected that mistake.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Taylor, on the question of

4

finding the mistake, you said that your client was kind of

5

lulled into a sense that there was nothing to be done

6

because the United States had made a representation that

7

there was nothing there, and yet there came a point in

8

time when you were vigorously pursuing Freedom of

9

Information Act, everything that you could.

10
11

You hired

your own researcher.
So why did you shift from trusting the

12

Government and saying, well, I'll accept their

13

representation, and then you took their money -- you were

14

paid, what, $2 00,000 - some-odd -- and then there was a

15

great flurry of activity, much investigation on your part.

16

So why -- well, what made you suddenly get into

17

this highly investigative mode when earlier you said, we

18

relied on the United States?

19

MR. TAYLOR:

Your Honor, the intensity of the

20

investigation slowed down some after the judgment was

21

entered but did increase again, or did recontinue

22

afterwards.

23

The critical point, I believe, so far as the

24

inability to bring this action within 1 year, is that the

25

Beggerlys had looked at archives all around, had hired an

As they got to the very end, after they'd done

not go back there is because -- based on this

Finally, as a last-ditch effort, they said okay,

17

let's take one more look, and they hired this genealogist

18

who went in and did intensive research over a period of

19

several weeks and found the document.

20

But they were directed away from the National

Archives as it got to the close of the litigation because

of the Government's representation, because they had

already deposed the Deputy of that office, who said there

doesn't do it, or that grant doesn't do it.

The other point is, it's a point

that was not presented in the Power's Heirs case.

legal issue was not presented as to the effect of the

treaty.

Your Honor, is that the documentation that was presented

to the court was incomplete.

not it had authentic, genuine evidence before it.

It was from a secondary and

And therefore your alleged

predecessor in title did not have title.
MR. TAYLOR:

Well, but this was Power's Heirs,

and that's a different document from the document we're

dealing with, Your Honor.

to different islands.

QUESTION:

That document was a separate

No, but isn't the crucial point that

17

the issue is the authority of the Governor to make the

grant, and the grant in Power's and the grant in this case

19

were made on the same day?

20

Power's is controlling?

21

MR. TAYLOR:

Isn't that the point on which

They -- the grants were made on the

22

same day, Your Honor, but I believe a reading of the

Power's Heirs case indicates that the court had

questionable evidence before it as to whether or not there

even was a grant - 48

Maybe it did have questionable

evidence - -

But that --

QUESTION:

-- but it's -- I'm sorry.

5

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

6

QUESTION:

I was going to -- regardless of what

7

its evidence was, its conclusion was that the Governor

8

could not make a grant on that day, and that is exactly

9

the fact in - - and the day is the same in your case, so I

10

assume that Power's decided the issue upon which your

11

claim rests.

12

MR. TAYLOR:

Well, the court did say that Galvez

13

did not have authority to make that grant on that day.

14

say that the court on the record very clearly says that we

15

suppose and we presume, and used speculative language

16

about what the history was to reach that conclusion.

17
18
19

I believe, though,

that the court was driven by

the fact that it had questionable documentation before it.
QUESTION:

But that -- but the decision

20

turned -- or, at least, it concluded that Galvez didn't

21

have the authority to make that grant, did it not?

It stated that in the opinion, Your

Honor, no question about that.

That was stated.

you're maintaining isn't consistent with the decision in

MR. TAYLOR:

2

Arguably not, Your Honor, but I

3

think you can distinguish it in this manner, that there

4

were other -- I don't think that -QUESTION:

5

Is this something we want to do in a

6

case involving real property title, where I think the

7

Solicitor General is right, that there stare decisis is

8

regarded as the most --at its greatest peak?
MR. TAYLOR:

9

I do not believe that this -- the

10

Court's affirmance of the Fifth Circuit ruling and

11

therefore finding the validity of the Boudreau grant would

12

do violence to titles, and the reason is, Your Honor, that

13

this -- we're talking about a period in the late 18th

14

Century and the Government raises a specter that we'll

15

have competing titles out there and that the Government

16

may have titles based upon the Louisiana Purchase and

17

authority it gained, which is in conflict with the Spanish

18

titles.

19

20
21

That's not so, Your Honor, because adverse
possession will have long since taken care of any issues.
QUESTION:

But it still undermines the principle

22

to say that this -- it will just have a limited effect

23

because other factors historically soon came into play.

24
25

I don't think that really counsels in favor of
being more lenient with stare decisis here, because the

1

general proposition is that when you're dealing with real

2

property titles you adhere most closely to it.
MR. TAYLOR:

3

I understand that rule of law, Your

4

Honor, and I understand the reason behind it, but I - - my

5

statement is, it is a matter of fact there will not be any

6

conflict with any titles caused by ruling that the

7

Boudreau grant was a valid grant, because adverse

8

possession, whether it's the Government's title, and

9

you've got a national forest, or museum, or whatever it

10

may have on the land, adverse possession will clear up any

11

problems with that, and if there's conflicting,

12

theoretically conflicting private titles, adverse

13

possession again would clean those up.

14

Clearly, the Beggerlys' title itself, they paid

15

taxes for 32 years on this land, and in fact paid quite a

16

bit more money than that initial tax payment, because the

17

tax bills were going up over time.
Nobody was claiming against them.

18

The

19

Government recognized their title itself and negotiated

20

with them for several years and made offers to them to buy

21

it.

22

Government presented him with title opinions.

that the title was in the Beggerlys.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q. WOLFSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

-- Mr. Taylor.

MR. WOLFSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

A

few points.

9

First, on the question of mistake on the West

20

Virginia Oil & Gas decision that my colleague mentioned,

21

first of all let me say we think that case was incorrectly

22

decided.

23
24
25

It's an old Fifth Circuit case.
QUESTION:

Well, and it also requires negligence

on the part - MR. WOLFSON:

Right.

2

QUESTION:

-- the absence of negligence on the

part of the moving party.

3

MR. WOLFSON:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

I --

Do you think we have the authority in

5

this -- based on the issues that are before us, to rule in

6

your favor based on the fact that the misrepresentation is

7

not sufficient to set aside the judgment?

8

MR. WOLFSON:

9

QUESTION:

10

On the facts --

Your brief asks that we remand.

MR. WOLFSON:

Right.

On the -- well -- on the

11

facts of this -- I think that if -- assume we're wrong on

12

the first two questions presented and there is

13

jurisdiction in the district court, I think that the case

14

has to go back to the district court for a determination

15

about the facts of this case, because the -- once the

16

dismissal based on lack of jurisdiction would be wiped

17

out, then the case is no longer really in the court of

18

appeals and the case should go back to the district court

19

for further proceedings.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WOLFSON:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. WOLFSON:

There --

Was there a ruling on laches on - Yes.

-- the independent action?
Yes, there was, Your Honor.

The

24

district court concluded that the respondents'

25

independent -- it recognized that there was a bar of -53

1

there could be a bar of laches, and it ruled that

2

respondents' independent action was barred by laches.
Now, the court of appeals just didn't really

3
4

address that at all, and nonetheless, you know, held for

5

the respondents.
QUESTION:

6

7

Can you go back to Justice Kennedy's

question?

8

MR. WOLFSON:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

I was thinking, maybe if we're trying

10

to reconcile independent action with the first part of the

11

rule, you would do it by saying, independent action of

12

those unusual egregious frauds, et cetera, but you say, if

13

I thought that I couldn't say that here.

14

send it back.

15

MR. WOLFSON:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WOLFSON:

We'd have to

On the facts of this case, yes.

As to whether it is egregious?
As to whether it is egregious, and

18

because the -- it's the district court that is supposed

19

to -- it's the district court that's supposed to make an

20

evaluation, and then when it looked at the case it said,

21

you know, I don't find any evidence here of fraud or

22

mistake that would warrant setting aside the judgment.

23

QUESTION:

But I mean, is -- can we take certain

24

facts -- I mean, they have the record here.

25

look at their facts, which was testimony that was referred

Suppose we

1

2

to, and said that doesn't rise to the level, or it does?
MR. WOLFSON:

Well, of course, we - - I mean, I

3

think if it went back to the district court, we would move

4

for summary judgment, probably, on the grounds that there

5

was no evidence of fraud or mistake on - - and so on the

6

merits the independent action should not go forward.

7

think the court -- once -- all that the court of appeals

8

could have done was decide whether there was jurisdiction.

9

I

A couple of points about the National Archives.

10

I can't agree with the statement that the Government

11

directed the respondents away from the National Archives.

12

I understand that my colleague has relied on

13

Dr. Dorasavage's deposition, but I think it is important

14

that the whole of that deposition and also Mr. Knipfing's

15

deposition did say that the Crawford Commission report is

16

one standard source that we look to and it is in the

17

National Archives, and we did bring the Boudreau grant

18

specifically to the attention of the court.

19

Thank you.
