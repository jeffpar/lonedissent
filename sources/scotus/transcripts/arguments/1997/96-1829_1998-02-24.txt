CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Indians.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLAY RIGGS SMITH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The issue today is whether a Federal court may

11
12

award to respondents, Crow Tribe and the United States,

13

$58 million paid to the petitioners by a third party,

14

Westmoreland Resources.

15

Reduced to its essentials, the respondents'

16

theory is that a Federal court has this discretion and in

17

reality the obligation to make such an award merely

18

because the taxes have been held preempted and the actual

19

taxpayer has no entitlement to their recovery.
QUESTION:

20

Mr. Smith, I'd like to pursue with

21

you what you assert is the underlying cause of action

22

here.

23

sovereignty, some Federal cause of action, or is it

24

limited to a cause of action for money had and received

25

based on an implied contract?

Is it for some kind of breach of tribal

MR. SMITH:

1

Justice O'Connor, we believe the

2

action in this matter is limited to a cause of action for

3

money had and received, a cause --

4

QUESTION:

Well, that's interesting, because I

5

thought it had been determined in earlier litigation that

6

there was a Federal cause of action here based on a -- an

7

invasion of tribal sovereignty and a preemption by Federal

8

law of any State tax law.
MR. SMITH:

9

QUESTION:

10

Your Honor, that is -And I thought we had basically

11

summarily affirmed that notion.

wrong?

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

16

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

19

Your Honor, that is correct in the

Crow II decision, the 1987 Ninth Circuit decision.

15

18

Now, is that right or

Right.
The court of -So are we dealing here in this suit

with what remedy is appropriate based on that theory?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, we are, but I would

20

add, by way of further elaboration, that in determining

21

the appropriate remedy I think the Court is confronted

22

with the question of whether a Federal cause of action or

23

a Federal common law claim should be recognized under

24

these circumstances for --

QUESTION:

Well, if it's been determined that

1

there is some breach of tribal sovereignty by the State of

2

Montana, and if what we at bottom are faced with here is

3

what's the remedy, then I think your argument might focus

4

on what should be the remedy, and it's entirely possible

5

to me that it shouldn't be just a disgorgement of all the

6

taxes but, rather, a requirement that the Court would have

7

to look at what injury was suffered by the tribe in

8

crafting the amount of the remedy.

9

you make, or not?

10
11

MR. SMITH:

Is that an argument

Your Honor, that is not precisely

the argument we make.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SMITH:

No, I didn't think so.
The argument we make, if I may go

14

on, is that in this case we essentially dealt -- played

15

the hand we were dealt in terms of the respondent's theory

16

and their theory of recovery, as set forth in their

17

amended complaints and, indeed, in subsequent pleadings

18

and in the pretrial order, was a theory which sought

19

recovery of taxes paid by Westmoreland Resources.

20

Had -- had the respondents attempted to recover

21

compensatory damages, that is to say, damages directed

22

specifically to the injury that the tribe suffered with

23

respect to the marketability of its coal, we would have an

24

entirely different case than we have before us today.

QUESTION:

And the complaint was amended, as I

recall, after our affirmance in Crow II?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

3

It was amended in 1989 by the tribe, it's fourth amended

complaint, and the United States filed essentially the

5

same complaint 6 months later in 1990.

11

QUESTION:

Is money had and received the same as

restitution?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I would say not.

Restitution is a broader concept which covers a rather
extensive range of potential remedies.
QUESTION:

Why can't they just get restitution?

12

Why couldn't -- I mean, here why can't the -- here's -- I

13

take it there's a person who paid some taxes to the State

14

and the Indian tribe says, well, the State doesn't --

15

isn't entitled to that money, and we're more entitled to

16

it than they are, because probably we would have gotten at

17

least some of it, so we would like it in restitution.

18

shouldn't they have it?

19

MR. SMITH:

20

QUESTION:

Why

The State isn't entitled to it.

Your Honor -I'll add that my law clerk found a

21

bunch of cases that do seem, in restitution, to give one

22

of the two competing entities in taxes -- you pay it to

23

the wrong one, well, the right one has a right in

24

restitution to get it from the wrong one.

MR. SMITH:

Justice Breyer, the claim that is

respondents by Westmoreland.

4

traditional quasi-contract remedy, and it has been the

5

petitioners' position throughout that, given the nature of

6

the quite specific remedy sought, that the traditional

7

standards associated with quasi-contract govern the

8

respondents' entitlement to those moneys.

9

QUESTION:

It seeks, in essence, a

Mr. Smith, may I ask you to clarify

10

in response to Justice Breyer's inquiry?

11

your brief to say it's not a question of one Government

12

receiving the tax versus the other, like one county

13

getting what belonged to another county.

14

I understood

I think your position was that even if there had

15

been no tax by the State of Montana there could not have

16

been a tax by the tribe instead, because it didn't have

17

the requisite Federal permission in the years in question,

18

is that correct?

19

MR. SMITH:

That's correct, Your Honor and,

20

indeed, the district court so found following the 1994

21

trial, the second trial in this matter.

22

QUESTION:

So it's not like getting benefits

23

that should have gone to you that went to somebody else,

24

but your position is that it would have been -- the tribe

25

could not have gotten the tax.

Mr. Smith, judging from the number of

heavily on our decision in United States v. California.

that there was no duty to pay the tribe.

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
And how do you fit that into your

case?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, we believe that

8

California stands for the general proposition that quasi­

9

contract relief is available as a matter of Federal common

20

law only with respect to the entity or person who bears

21

the legal incidence of the tax.

22

Moreover, the facts in California are remarkably

23

similar to the facts here, in the sense that the United

24

States in that case, similar to the tribe in this case,

25

was attempting to enforce in essence an independent

2

contractor in that case and the United States, just as the

tribe in this case is, when you cut through the chaff, is

attempting to enforce real or imagined obligations that

the terms of the

7

976 Tribal Tax Code.

QUESTION:

Well, but the big difference, of

8

course, is that in U.S. v. California the suit was based

9

on money had and received, which this Court said required

10

finding an implied contract, and the tax was found to have

violated State law.

Here, you've got in earlier litigation resolved

in Crow II a determination, affirmed by this Court, that

the Montana law violated tribal sovereignty and was,

indeed, preempted by Federal law.

Now, that is a

I think U.S. v. California on that basis is
distinguishable.

different.
QUESTION:

Well, is it too late?

Maybe what

3

needs to be done is to vacate and remand, so that the

4

Court can address what is the appropriate remedy.

5

Court may well have found an improper remedy, just lumping

6

all the taxes together and saying, fine, you get it, but

7

they're probably entitled to something if they can

establish injury.

MR. SMITH:

The

Your Honor, the respondents in this

case made a very conscious decision not to pursue a

damages claim with respect to Westmoreland.

QUESTION:

No.

Indeed, they

They're talking about some

15

remedy against the State of Montana, which -- and it is

16

the State of Montana by its law that is said to have

17

violated tribal sovereignty, not Westmoreland.

18

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I may have misspoke.

19

The tribe attempted to amend its complaint in

20

1993 to allege, in essence, a damages claim against the

21

State and the county with respect to the nondevelopment of

22

a project on the reservation called Young's Creek, and we

23

loosely call that the Shell issue, and that issue was

24

resolved against it by the district court and by the court

of appeals.

Westmoreland and the tribe, but as -- and it's summarized

perhaps in most detail in our opposition, which is Clerk's

Record 600, to the United States and the tribe's motion to

amend their amended complaints in 1993.

14

We summarized in some detail the conscious

decision by the respondents not to pursue a damages claim,

16

and that description appears on pages 2 through 11 of

17

Clerk's Record 600.

18

There is simply no question, we respectfully

19

submit, in this case that if there in fact could have been

20

a damages claim the respondents made a conscious

21

litigation decision not to pursue it, and that was not an

22

unreasonable determination.

That's correct, Your Honor.
Could I ask, about that settlement --

it really puzzles me.

dollars, as I remember it, and they settled for $50,000.

5

Was there some other consideration given to Westmoreland

in that settlement, other than $50,000?

7

strange.
MR. SMITH:

8

9

They had a claim for millions of

It seems very

No -- there was no other

consideration given, Your Honor.
The -- Westmoreland at that point in time had a

10
11

claim that from the petitioner's view and I believe from

12

Westmoreland's view had zero value, because at that point

3

in time it had long since passed any -- bypassed any

4

opportunity to challenge the State taxes under State law.

QUESTION:

Well, the State statute of

limitations in effect had run on its ability to recover.

MR. SMITH:

MR. SMITH:

And so the $50,000 from its

perspective was approximately $50,000 more than its claim

was worth.

1

made its claim, as you say, worthless?
MR. SMITH:

2

Your Honor, under State law -- first

3

of all, there are two taxes involved in this question, in

4

this case, a gross proceeds tax and a severance tax, and

5

there are actually different protest procedures for each

6

of those taxes, but generally speaking for each tax the --

7

Westmoreland was required within a specific period of time

8

to file a protest and then with respect to the gross

9

proceeds tax and the severance tax for a period of time to

10

initiate a lawsuit in State district court.

11

do that.

12

It failed to

The State procedures for protest with respect to

13

the severance tax changed in 1983 retroactive to 1981,

14

which provided for a protest procedure and then

15

administrative review by the Department of Revenue and a

16

lawsuit if the -- if Westmoreland was dissatisfied with

17

the resolution of its claim.

18

So again, the --by the time the settlement

19

agreement was entered into in 198 -- in 1991,

20

Westmoreland's claim had, I think from its perspective,

21

zero value.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, may I ask you about a

23

possibly different way of looking at the case or

24

characterizing the claim?

25

Up to this point we've been doing it in terms of

One taxed when it shouldn't.

3

in effect wants the money that the first one wrongfully

took.

The other one could have and

But there's another way, I think, to look at

5
6

this, and that is to emphasize what I take is not subject

7

to dispute either as a matter of the record or as a matter

8

of economics, and that was that what the State of Montana

9

took through its taxation was a very substantial

10

percentage of the economic value of the coal.

11

were -- the tribe was able to keep, or Westmoreland was

12

able to keep on selling it with the tax added, but in fact

13

the ultimate party losing was the party that owned the

14

coal.

They

here is a contest between a Government which, through its

taxation, took a substantial interest in the property of

Now the tribe, whether you call it a taxing

We know that the tax was in fact an invalid tax, so as

economic value, and the owner of the property, the owner

1

of the value which was taken, why isn't it fairly clear

2

that the owner of the value taken, the tribe, ought to get

3

it back?

4

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I think there are two

5

reasons why a negative answer is appropriate.

First, the

6

State of Montana did not take value during the period

7

we're really concerned with, 1976 through 1982, from the

8

tribe.

9

of Westmoreland's taxes.

It took value from Westmoreland Resources in terms

Now, at that point in time, the district court

10

11

found, and we believe the record supports the factual and

12

legal conclusion that Westmoreland simply would not have

13

paid the 19 -- paid taxes under the 1976 Tribal Taxation

14

Code, so it was not as if the State of Montana --

15

QUESTION:

Well, it wouldn't have because

16

Westmoreland couldn't have passed it on, either as a

17

matter of the utilities law or as a matter of economics.
What, as I understand it, Westmoreland was doing

18
19

with respect to the Montana tax was simply passing it on

20

to its customers.

21

MR. SMITH:

22

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor, and -Yes.

So Westmoreland was getting the

23

same profit on its contract that it would have been

24

getting if it had, in fact, not been subject to Montana

25

tax.

1

MR. SMITH:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. SMITH:

That's correct.
Okay.
Because, again, the economic

4

incidence of this tax was passed contractually through to

5

Westmoreland's utility customers.

6

QUESTION:

But the fact that the coal was still

an indication of the value that was in the coal and

9

ultimately that value belonged to the owner of the coal

11

who was selling it, and that was the tribe, wasn't it?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, the -- we would suggest

12

that the value of the coal was the value -- from the

13

tribe's perspective was the value that it received under

14

its 1974 lease agreement with Westmoreland.

15

QUESTION:

Well, maybe they didn't make a good

16

lease agreement.

17

if they didn't make a good lease agreement, it doesn't

18

follow that the State of Montana is entitled to take what

19

they should have been getting for themselves.

20

the State of Montana and the tribe, I don't see why the

21

tribe's claim is not the obviously prevailing one, if

22

that's a proper way of looking at the case.

23

I have no idea.

MR. SMITH:

But the fact is, even

As between

24

that the issue in this case is whether the tribe has a

legal entitlement to recovery of those taxes, even when

the taxpayer itself does not.

2

QUESTION:

Well, we're in the position of

3

fashioning a remedy for what was, in fact, a violation of

4

Federal law, and I'm not sure that I agree with you that

5

we are necessarily bound by categories of common law

6

remedial practice in fashioning that remedy.

7

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, if we depart from common

8

law tradition in this regard, one must ask him or herself

9

the question of why the tribe as opposed to Westmoreland,

10

or for that matter Westmoreland's customers, is more

11

entitled to these moneys.

12

Westmoreland, through the legal incidence, and

13

Westmoreland's customers through the economic incidence,

14

actually bore the burden of this tax.

15

QUESTION:

But Mr. Smith, why -- I'm not

16

following this colloquy between you and Justice Souter.

17

It seems -- was the coal contracted for and the price

18

fixed between the tribe and Westmoreland before the taxes

19

were imposed?

20

MR. SMITH:

21

QUESTION:

They were, Your Honor.
So at that point, it seems to me, the

22

value of the coal to the tribe was no more and no less

23

than what it had contracted to sell it for.

24

MR. SMITH:

That's correct.

more in the abstract, but if it made a bad contract its

2

value to the tribe at that point is simply what it

3

contracted to sell it for, I assume.

4
5

MR. SMITH:

That's correct and, Your Honor,

indeed, the tribe did not make a bad contract.
QUESTION:

6

Well, I guess the tribe is saying,

7

though that, but for the subsequently enacted tax, that

8

Westmoreland would have taken more coal out and been able

9

to sell more and they would have gotten more royalties and

10

what's more maybe there was some other land they could

11

have leased out for coal removal, but because of Montana's

12

tax they weren't able to do it.
But that doesn't equate automatically with the

13
14

amount of Montana's tax, it seems to me.

15

need to pursue what really is the injury to the tribe in

16

terms of dollars.

17

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor,

I still think we

I agree, and the injury

18

to the tribe in terms of dollars would, at least in

19

theory, have been best quantified through a compensatory

20

damages kind of claim and, as I've said before, that is

21

not the kind of claim that has ever been maintained in

22

this action and, indeed, it is the kind of claim that the

23

tribe and the United States disclaimed any interest in

24

pursuing.

Yes.
When you say common law authority,

what common law authority?

That is, I found -- I thought

restitution authority is you're supposed to do basically

B and puts it to a use whereby he makes some money out of

it, that money -- you know, person A wrongfully takes the

property of B and makes some money out of its use, and

thought restitution would give it back to the original

owner of the property.

Your Honor, but following that -I mean, is there some common law

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

If the tribe had executed its leases

execution of those mining agreements or leases had then

imposed a tax, would that have been inconsistent with the

18

contract documents?

19

MR. SMITH:

I think Westmoreland, Your Honor,

20

would have said was -- it wasn't consistent, because

21

Westmoreland saw the 1974 lease amendment as the complete

22

economic settlement between the parties.

So it's not at all clear that the

3

from doing so by the Department of Interior.

MR. SMITH:

That's what I thought.
Because the Department had doubted

the authority of the tribe to tax off-reservation

transactions, and the ceded strip is outside -QUESTION:

8

9

Well, was that a matter of the

tribe's sovereign authority, or was part of that decision

10

motive, it was one of the reasons offered in denial of the

11

permission to tax, the fact that the tribe had already

12

made a contract?
MR. SMITH:

13

No, Your Honor.

It was based solely

14

on the tribe's constitution and the Department's

15

interpretation that it did not permit off-reservation

16

taxation.

17

QUESTION:

And there was a subsequent district

QUESTION:

But quite apart from the tribe's

argument that this -- that the imposition of the tax was

inconsistent with its contract negotiations.

assuming is that in the question of, as it were, the value

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS
MR. PELCYGER:

Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and

may it please the Court:

10

I'd like to start by addressing some of the

11

questions that were raised by the Court to Mr. Smith.

12

First, I'd like briefly to refer to Rule 54(c) of the

13

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which states that every

14

final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party

15

in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the

party has not demanded such relief in the party's

Justice, in which the district court denied the motion --

2

this was in 1990, long before the trial in this case, in

3

which the district court denied Montana's motion to

4

dismiss, stating that the current phase of this case was

5

an extension of the district court's previously invoked

6

equity jurisdiction and that, once violations of

7

significant tribal interest were established, the district

8

court had "broad equitable powers" that refers -- broad

9

equitable powers to construct a remedy that refers to

10

State law and is not defeated by it, so it was known

11

throughout this litigation what this case was about, and

12

this is not a pleading case.
QUESTION:

13

Well, Mr. Pelcyger, why shouldn't the

14

remedy be tailored to the damages suffered by the tribe?

15

In other words, the loss to the tribe of royalties that it

16

otherwise would have had if more coal had been taken by

17

Westmoreland and sold, or other revenues that it might

18

have derived if other people had not been discouraged by

19

the amount of Montana's unlawful tax from making lease

20

arrangements with the tribe?
I don't see why the measure of damages should

21

22

automatically be the amount of the taxes collected by

23

Montana.

I think it should be directed to the tribe's

The court of appeals held twice, both in Crow II

Kennedy's question that this Court held in the case of

Well, that's a -- perhaps a

it's viewed.
But what the record shows here clearly and

unmistakably, the first thing, Justice O'Connor, that

clear by a 1976 letter that is in the record in the joint

was subsequently determined that this coal was reservation

QUESTION:

Now, in

Well, not only that, the tribe's tax

Well, under --

I mean, this -- we're just addressing

MR. PELCYGER:

Well, Montana, of course, was

13

free to defend on that ground, that there was a disparity

14

and, indeed, the law of restitution recognizes that if

15

there is a gross disparity between the unlawful gain and

16

the amount -- restitution does not exist in order to give

17

plaintiffs an unjust enrichment, and Montana was free to

18

argue that.

19

In fact, they did not argue that, not at all.

20

What Montana argued was that we provided services to all

the Crow members, the same services they would have

What was violated was the Commerce

MR. PELCYGER:

No.

What was violated -- and the

fact, this Court in Commonwealth-Edison specifically-

6

upheld this same tax as applied to Federal coal.

7

What was violated here was the tribe's

sovereignty and the Indian Mineral Leasing Act under which

MR. PELCYGER:

No.

Westmoreland just got the

5

$50,000 that you referred to.

QUESTION:

MR. PELCYGER:

Okay.
So you have to look at the

8

purpose of the Federal statute.

9

Federal statute was not to confer a benefit on the

11
12

The purpose of the

taxpayer.
Ordinarily, when taxes are held invalid the
automatic assumption is, the taxes were held invalid, the

3

taxpayer gets to get the money back because the taxes were

4

invalid, but here the sole and exclusive intended

5

beneficiary of the laws that were violated was the tribe,

6

it wasn't Westmoreland, and for Westmoreland to escape

7

with no taxes whatsoever would not be a result that is

8

consistent with the purposes of the statute and would not

9

effectuate the purposes of the statute --

QUESTION:

Mr. -- I'm sorry.

Mr. Pelcyger, I want to ask whether the terms of

22

the lease might have a bearing on the answer to Justice

23

O'Connor's question.

Assume that at a given

time the Secretary of the Interior said, you may not tax.

Assume that Westmoreland says, as it did, I don't care who

I pay the money to.

and you guys fight it out.

I can sell the coal at this price,

If the tax at that point had been declared

invalid, as it was, could the tribe -- did the tribe have

6

a right under its lease agreement simply to demand a

7

renegotiation of the price at which it would sell so that

8

it could have gotten as its lease price what the

9

Department of the Interior was not allowing it to get by

10

way of taxation?
MR. PELCYGER:

There was not -- there was a

provision for renegotiation of royalties, but on specific

dates.

MR. PELCYGER:

into in 1974, Your Honor.

are you going to be able to show that if the Montana

They passed on

I know from West -- we're talking

about the damages, and what I'm interested in is whether

7

you think you'd be able to show that in the absence of

8

this unlawful tax, everybody knew it was unlawful.

9

Everybody knew from the year 1800 that they couldn't do

10
11

it.
Now, if they had known that all in advance,

12

would the tribe have been able, even if the Secretary of

13

the Interior made the mistake about the tax, they say,

14

okay, you're right, we can't tax you, Westmoreland, but

15

what we can do is increase our royalties, and we will.

Now, do you think that you can show that that's
what would have happened?

happened under those circumstances.

reveal what I'm thinking, I'm thinking that if this money

MR. PELCYGER:

Well, let me just say, the record

MR. PELCYGER:

1

That's part of the position, Your

2

Honor.

3

here, both of which were found by the lower courts.

4

There are two different discrete claims of injury

The first

discrete claim relates to the coal

5

that was actually produced and sold, and there the claim

6

is the tribe was deprived of its fair share of the

7

economic rent.
In addition to that, there's a claim with regard

8

9

to -- or an injury with regard to the coal that was not

10

sold because the price was too high because of the State's

11

tax.
There's no damages sought now on the basis of

12

13

that second category, but the first category is what we're

14

talking about, and that's what the focus is on.

15

Now, let me just say one other thing.

16

There's

no reason --

17

QUESTION:

But as to that -- as to that, the

18

tribe had entered into an agreement before there were any

19

taxes by either Montana or the tribe, or the amount of the

royalties it wanted and would accept, and so it's hard to

understand how the subsequent imposition of a tax which

There's

QUESTION:

Well, at a time -- at a time when the

to equate that with the direct injury.

MR. PELCYGER:

Well, the reason -- the tribe was

cause of action, and here it does, a violation of a

5

Federal right, but as I read the California opinion, the

Court's reasoning didn't turn on that fact.

7

just address that sometime in your argument.
MR. LAMKEN:

8

9

Yes, Your Honor.

It's

If you'll

Why don't I begin

with that.
California involved a claim that the -- the

10
11

question was whether there was a Federal common law cause

12

of action in the United States against the State of

13

California where California had not violated Federal law

14

and it had not invaded any sovereign right of the United

15

States.

16

was it had voluntarily agreed to indemnify a third party

17

that had paid the tax potentially in violation of State

18

law.

19

The only reason the United States was in the case

This Court held that the United States could not

20

use its voluntary indemnification of that third party to

21

create a Federal common law cause of action out of what

22

was in essence a State law cause of action.

23

the Federal Government did not obtain any greater rights

24

than the third party that had indemnified had to begin

25

with.

In essence,

Federal law, and it did not violate the law -- the rights

Montana violated not State law, but it violated

action.

The United States v. California came up through

the Federal courts, didn't it?

I wonder if your

MR. LAMKEN:

Cause of action can be -- the

QUESTION:

Accordingly, the claim by the

As I understand your theory, if

California taxed a corporation that was doing business in

10

California and Nevada and the corporation said, you know,

11

really, this is interstate commerce, you can't tax our

12

income, and settled with California, under your theory I

13

guess Nevada could say, we don't have a corporate income

14

tax, but you know, you took the tax that really should

15

have been ours, so we'll sue you, State of California.

16

suppose under your theory Nevada would prevail.

17

MR. LAMKEN:

I

No, Your Honor, I don't believe

18

that that case could be brought, and I think this is in

19

part a response to Justice O'Connor's question, and that

20

is that the purpose of a remedy such as restitution is to

21

restore the parties to the position they would have

22

occupied had Federal law been respected to begin with.

23
24
25

Restitution begins that process by forcing the
defendant to disgorge its unlawful gains.
Now, it's important in tax cases to start with a

5

California, it's not yours.
MR. LAMKEN:

The company's

It should be ours.

Well, the next step, however, in

6

the analysis, Your Honor, is, where there's a gross

7

disparity between the two -- between the injury to the

8

plaintiff and the unjust gain to the defendant, the court

9

can deny restitution because the restitution would not --

10

the enrichment was not unjust vis-a-vis the plaintiff.
Another way of looking at it is simply, if the

11
12

plaintiff has no injury whatsoever it cannot seek

13

restitution.

14

QUESTION:

Their point is that, that I take it

15

that the, Montana's point is that in the absence of this

16

unlawful tax of the $58 million, or whatever, the tribe

17

couldn't have gotten the money.

18

It couldn't have gotten the money through a

19

royalty because it had long previously signed a definite

20

contract.

21

because the Secretary of the Interior had said you can't

tax.

It couldn't have gotten the money through a tax

23

So in the absence of their having taken the

24

money, the tribe could never have seen a penny of it,

regardless, and therefore they are not a proper person to

give the money back to.
Now, I take it that that's basically their

3

point, as I've understood it, and so what is your response

4

directly to that?

5

MR. LAMKEN:

Our response to that is the same

6

response that the court below had, which is, it's not

7

supported by the evidence, and there's two reasons why --

8

9
10

QUESTION:

And what does -- and fine, so what

is -- what does the evidence support, in your view?
MR. LAMKEN:

First, the evidence supports that

11

in the absence of the Montana tax, Westmoreland is willing

12

to pay additional royalties to the tribe whether by way of

13

tax or by way of royalty agreements in any amount that it

14

saved from the Montana tax.

15

in the Montana tax would have been -- Westmoreland was

16

willing to pay that to the tribe.

17

QUESTION:

In other words, any reduction

Is that right?

I mean, is that

18

really credible?

19

said, you know, this tax is unlawful, and we know we can't

20

get any more royalties from you, we have a deal, and we

21

know we can't tax you because we've been told by the

22

Secretary of the Interior he won't give permission, and

23

Westmoreland says, oh, that's okay, I'll give you the $38

24

million instead of the State.

says that we have previously negotiated regarding

you will have to be in lieu of the State tax and not in

However, any additional payments to

And in addition, at joint appendix pages 397 and

that they were willing -- any reduction in Montana tax

11

That's a quite different statement,

12

any additional payments to you will have to be in lieu of

instead of in addition to, and you characterize that as a

4

sort of volunteering to give you the money that we save

5

from the tax?

6

MR. LAMKEN:

In light of the negotiations that

7

had occurred, that is what it means, and on page 397 and

they're willing to share any savings that the tribe could

obtain from the Montana tax for them through use of its

governmental authorities with the -QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
That's more plausible, but you've

already cut your claim by 50 percent now.
MR. LAMKEN:

Your Honor, it's not -- I don't

5

think there is a precise one -- necessarily a proven

6

precise one-to-one correspondence between the loss to this

by the court of appeals.

9

QUESTION:

Well, exactly.

10

QUESTION:

Well -- yes.

QUESTION:

I -- this business of equating it automatically
with the amount of tax I just don't understand.
MR. LAMKEN:

Well, I think Your Honor, equity

starts -- restitution starts with the unlawful gain to the

defendant, and the reason it starts there -- and I'll go

to how it can get reduced.

Westmoreland had recovered all the tax itself, then the

2

tribe would not be able to get any money.

3

MR. LAMKEN:

If Westmoreland had recovered the

4

money, under the doctrines of benefits conferred the claim

5

would no longer be against Montana but upon -- the

6

beneficiary of the tax would be Westmoreland, so the

7

tribe's action would have to run against Westmoreland and

8

not the State of Montana.
QUESTION:

9

You mean they would have been able to

10

recover this money from Westmoreland if Westmoreland had

recovered it from Montana?
MR. LAMKEN:

The answer is potentially yes, and

QUESTION:

3

MR. LAMKEN:

That's correct.
-- the Montana tax.
That's correct, and when there

court would be justified in rolling back the

restitutionary remedy and saying, well, the goal here is

to return the parties to the position they would have

occupied if Federal law had been obeyed.

The same would be true for Montana,

then, too, wouldn't it?

11

MR. LAMKEN:

QUESTION:

13

MR. LAMKEN:

That's true.
Okay.
If Montana had raised and proven

14

through evidence that the damages were grossly

15

disproportionate, got much lower than the restitution or

16

remedy, a court would be justified in rolling back the

17

restitution or remedy.

18

QUESTION:

No, but isn't it clear on the record

19

that if the criterion of what the tribe gets looks to the

20

position that the tribe would have been in but for the

21

tax, even on that criterion, the tribe, based on the

22

record we've got, would not have gotten all that Montana

23

took.

point is always the gain to the defendant.

it's the defendant's obligation to come forward and say,

2

assert and prove that this inherent restitutionary remedy,

3

based on its gain, is inequitable --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. LAMKEN:

6

Well, is this --- because it overcompensates the

plaintiff.

7

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Are you making this turn

8

basically on procedure, that although there is indication

9

in the record that the tribe in fact would not have

10

received, either by lease negotiation or by taxation, what

11

dollar-for-dollar Montana took, that somehow Montana

12

nonetheless has got to give it all back because Montana

3

did not go through some procedure of proving that, even

4

though we've got evidence in the record that indicates

that?

6

Is that your position?
MR. LAMKEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

The position is

that if it's not grossly disproportional, a little bit of

difference between the restitutionary measure and the

9

damages measure does not make a difference.

20

QUESTION:

Well, it sounds -- this --

QUESTION:

You're writing all of this from

cases, moreover, in which the restitution is being made to

23

the person from whom the money was taken.

In this case, it would have been the corporation
and not the tribe, and I think to simply use the same

burden of proof rules in this very different situation is

unreasonable.

3

It is, indeed, reasonable to presume that the

4

whole amount of wrongfully acquired money goes back to the

5

person whom you took it from, and the burden would be on

6

Benvenuto Cellini to show that in fact he gave added value

7

to the lump of gold that he had stolen.

8

reasonable.

That's very

But where you're asking us to give the money to

9
10

a third party, not to the person from whom it was taken,

11

it seems to me the burden of proof should be on that third

12

party to show that I was injured by this taking from

13

somebody else.

14

to you?

Don't you -- doesn't that seem reasonable

15

MR. LAMKEN:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

In the abstract -You want us to assume automatically

that the tribe was injured $38 million worth.
MR. LAMKEN:

The cases run exactly that way.

19

Even where the money is not obtained directly from the

20

plaintiff, it is the defendant's obligation to come

21

forward and show that restitution would be unjust or --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Lamken, something happened in the

23

district court, and the district court thought,

I'm

24

supposed to do something equitable, and that seems to have

25

been forgotten by everybody, that here was a district

1

judge, he said, I'm going to consider the factors on both

2

sides.

3

And one of the things that he said he thought

4

might be relevant -- I hope I remember this correctly --

5

was from day one the tribe could have stopped Montana

6

because the tribe is not blocked by the Anti-Injunction

7

Act, so he's kind of mixing all the equities.

8

9

So -- but he did take into account a lot of the
things that we have been talking about.

Where did he go

10

wrong if we don't buy your theory that you start with

11

every penny that Montana got and then, if we don't buy

12

that, what's wrong with what the district judge did?

13

MR. LAMKEN:

The first error the district court

14

committed, Your Honor, is the district court failed to

15

consider additional royalties as a possible source of gain

16

to the tribe.

17

The district court looked simply at the

18

possibility of a tax, and even there the district court

19

had conflicting holdings.

20

the district court had not been approved by the Secretary,

21

so Westmoreland wouldn't have paid it.

22

it held that the tax had been approved by the Secretary

23

because the ceded strip is part of the reservation and the

24

tax was approved as to the -- excuse me, the coal under

25

the ceded strip was part of the reservation and the tax

On the one hand it held that

On the other hand,

1

had been approved as to the reservation.
Accordingly, under that holding, if Westmoreland

2

3

had not paid the money to the State of Montana instead,

4

the tribe would be proceeding against Westmoreland for the

5

money.

6

QUESTION:

But that was much, much later.

7

In the years that we're talking about,

8

'82, none of that was settled.

9

MR. LAMKEN:

'75 to

The district court's holding was

10

from 1990, that's correct, but the court of appeals had

11

the same holding back in 1982 in Crow I.

12

QUESTION:

Even '82 was the end of this period.

13

We're talking about '75 to '82.

14

MR. LAMKEN:

That's correct, Your Honor, but I'm

15

not sure why it would make any difference, because the

16

point of the matter is, if the tax was valid the tribe

17

could go after Westmoreland for the tax.

18

so here because Westmoreland was not the party --

19

QUESTION:

It's not doing

Well, if the United States didn't

20

give the tribe permission to tax in '75, could a decision

21

by a court saying, oh, United States, you should have

22

authorize the tax, that the tribe meant to reach back 7

23

years and say, taxpayer, now cough up?

24
25

MR. LAMKEN:

Actually, the court -- the district

court didn't say you should have given permission.

It

1

said that you in fact did.

2

You may not have intended to, but the moment you

3

said the tax is approved as to the reservation, a fortiori

4

it applied to the coal in the ceded strip, because that is

5

part of the reservation, so when the Secretary wrote down

6

the words, approved --

7

QUESTION:

And where does it say that

8

Westmoreland would have been bound to pay the tribe

9

because all those years later a court said, gee, we got it

10
11
12

13

wrong the first time, or the Secretary got it wrong?
MR. LAMKEN:

There is no district court holding

on that point, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

What about the Tax Injunction Act,

14

that the tribe is in an advantageous position with respect

15

to that, it can do what others can't do?

16

at no point didn't the United States and the tribe think

17

about enjoining Montana from collecting this unlawful tax?

18

MR. LAMKEN:

It did, Your Honor.

It didn't.

The suit was

filed in 1978.

injunction until 1982 was the claim was dismissed for

21

failure to state a claim.

22

The only reason they didn't get an

Until the Ninth Circuit reversed that dismissal

23

there's no chance whatsoever of our -- of obtaining an

24

injunction against the tax.
