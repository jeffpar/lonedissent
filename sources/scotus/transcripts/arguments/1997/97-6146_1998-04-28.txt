ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD GARDNER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GARDNER:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If the judge in this case, or the jury, had

12
13

found sufficient evidence to sustain the charged

14

allegation, and the State court of appeal had affirmed

15

that finding, that judgment as to my client would have

16

been final.

17

new fact-finder, and try it again.
This case arises, or presents the flip side of

18
19

I could not go into State court, empanel a

the question.
QUESTION:

20

Could you in other States, or is that

21

a peculiarity under California law, or is this just a rule

22

of finality that prevails, you think,

23

jurisdictions?

24
25

in most

You just -- no way to reopen it?

MR. GARDNER:

My guess is that it's a rule of

finality.

Well, there could be a collateral

some kind of new evidence.

7
8

QUESTION:

The case would be final on

But any number of collateral attacks

might be possible.

9

MR. GARDNER:

Certainly.

There's a presence of

10

collateral attacks, new evidence if there was suppressed

11

evidence, but this case presents the flip side of the

12

factual scenario I started with, where there's been a

13

finding of insufficient evidence, and the question is,

14

finding by the appellate court, does that finding have any

15

finality?

17

the case.

18

The question in this case is, does double

QUESTION:

Well, does California have -- in your

19

first hypothetical, assuming you lose and you find there

20

was something wrong, there was not really a prior

21

conviction, there's no motion to modify the sentence?

22

After the court has affirmed the conviction, the man has

23

served for a year, and all of a sudden we find out that

24

the three strikes isn't right, he can't go into the

to modify the sentence?
MR. GARDNER:

2

He could seek a writ of habeas

3

corpus, or if the trial court still had jurisdiction,

4

perhaps.

5

on that sentence, absolutely.

6

QUESTION:

There are collateral attacks that could be made

And of course the State can't

7

collaterally attack the sentence.

what happens on direct review.
MR. GARDNER:

9

The State is bound by

There is -- under the Double

10

Jeopardy Clause the State has no right to collaterally

11

attack or direct attack the judgment of acquittal.
QUESTION:

12

Well, but the State, there's simply

13

no proceeding available.

14

client there's no proceeding available whereby the State

15

could appeal and say, probably because of double jeopardy,

16

that this was a wrong result.

17

MR. GARDNER:

If, say, the jury acquits your

I think that's right, because of

18

the Double Jeopardy Clause there is no right to appeal a

19

jury's finding, or a jury verdict of acquittal.

20

question really gets at in this situation is the tension I

21

think that the Court addressed in Burks v. United States,

22

the possible distinction between a judgment of acquittal

23

by an appellate court and a judgment of acquittal by a

24

jury.

25

QUESTION:

What the

Well, of course, it's not just a

1

judgment -- you're saying that a judgment of acquittal is

2

the same thing as a sentencing determination.

3

MR. GARDNER:

Well, for purposes of the

4

distinction between an appellate court's finding and a

5

jury verdict, the distinction that the Court was referring

6

to in Burks, the question is, should those two be treated

7

differently?

8

9
10

There may be other reasons why a sentence
enhancement trial is not subject to double jeopardy and
we're certainly going to talk about those, I --

11

QUESTION:

I hope you will, yes.

12

MR. GARDNER:

-- I suspect, but for purposes of

3

the distinction between a trial acquittal and an appellate

4

acquittal, Burk suggests that there's no rational reason

5

why there should be a difference.

6

treatment should be the same, otherwise the petitioner or

7

the appellant is arbitrarily deprived of some right simply

8

because the trial level fact-finder made the wrong call.

9

QUESTION:

In both situations the

Well now, historically I guess we

20

have not thought that sentencing aspects are covered by

21

the Double Jeopardy Clause for most crimes, have we?

22

MR. GARDNER:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And if there were a judge imposing a

24

sentence in a case and imposes it and then the defendant

25

who is sentenced appeals on the ground that the judge

1

imposed a sentence not authorized by law and prevails,

2

then I suppose it would be remanded for resentencing.

3

MR. GARDNER:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes, it -- I agree.

You wouldn't be arguing double

jeopardy here.
MR. GARDNER:

6

I certainly wouldn't, or certainly

7

not here.

That would not be -- under the Court's

8

precedents double jeopardy plainly does not apply to
decisions made at traditional sentencing hearings.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GARDNER:

12

13

Right.
That's not what this case is all

about.
QUESTION:

But you say that this is different

14

because of the special procedures that California employs

15

in the context of this sentencing.

16

MR. GARDNER:

Yes.

In all respects the

17

sentencing in this case is identical to a trial on guilt

18

or innocence -- proof beyond a reasonable doubt, notice,

1

the right to confrontation, the right to a jury verdict --

20

QUESTION:

California was foolish to provide

21

those protections.

You're saying California should have

22

simply left it up to the judge to find those aggravating

23

factors by a preponderance of the evidence, and in that

24

case if the judge was reversed you'd be able to send it

25

back and have it found again, right?

MR. GARDNER:

1

Well, I don't agree with the

2

predicate that California was foolish for doing it.

3

think there were sound policy reasons that the legislature

4

had for giving these rights.

5

QUESTION:

I

But your argument is so

6

counterintuitive, that the more protection the State gives

7

to the defendant the worse shape the State is in as far as

8

being able to resentence if it's overturned on appeal.
Why do you want to punish the State for being

9
10

more concerned about the prisoner's rights, and instead of

11

letting the judge find it by a preponderance, saying,

12

we're going to insist that it be found by a jury beyond a

13

reasonable doubt?

14

MR. GARDNER:

I don't view it as punishing the

15

State.

This is the argument that's been made by some of

16

the amicus, the so-called no good deed goes unpunished,

17

which is certainly --

18

QUESTION:

I didn't think of that.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. GARDNER:

21

(Laughter.)

22

QUESTION:

Then I'm sorry I suggested it.

But are you accepting -- you are

23

accepting that California, unlike the death situation

24

where there has to be a procedure to present the

25

mitigators and the aggravators and -- that for this kind

1

of sentencing it isn't required to have a trial-type

2

hearing at all?

3

MR. GARDNER:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. GARDNER:

Yes.

You're conceding that?
Well, certainly perhaps 3 weeks

6

ago I could have made a different argument.

In light of

7

Almendarez-Torres I don't think I'm in a position to make

8

that argument, and so I'm not going to make that argument.
What I am saying is that when a State elects to

9
10

treat this just as a trial on guilt or innocence, then

11

there are some consequences, because when the State is

12

enacting this legislation there really are two models,

13

generally,

14

in criminal law.
We have the traditional guilt-or-innocence

15

model, which has all the rights, all the constitutional

16

rights that typically attach to such proceedings, and we

17

have traditional sentencing, and the legislature in this

18

case did not choose the traditional sentencing model,

19

which we -QUESTION:

20

But why is the State locked into two

21

models?

Why can't a State say,

look, we want to give him

22

some kind of hearing, but we don't want it to be -- we

23

don't want to get into the Bullington mode,

24

really saying that as a matter of constitutional law the

25

State is frozen into that stark choice?

so are you

MR. GARDNER:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

No, and I

Either give him no hearing, or give

him the full-dress hearing with the double jeopardy?
MR. GARDNER:

I didn't mean to suggest that.

If

5

I did, then I misspoke.

6

practical matter, when you look at the statutes that the

7

States have enacted, when you look at 50 statutes as to

8

sentence enhancements, what you see is State legislatures

9

choosing from two models.

10

What I'm suggesting is that as a

Now, I agree they don't have to, but as a

11

practical matter, that's what we see.

12

selection of a trial model with all the rights, or we see

3
4

We see either a

selection of a traditional sentencing model.
QUESTION:

But this isn't exactly one or the

5

other, is it, because although you said in a conclusory

6

way a moment ago that this, in fact, is the choice of the

7

trial model, there are at least two respects in which it's

8

different from the usual trial model and different from

9

what was involved in Bullington.

20

Number

, although in one respect there is a so-

21

called binary choice here, the binary choice nonetheless

22

operates in the sentencing proceeding in which there is

23

the traditional judicial discretion to set the base

24

sentence upon which the binary -- the multiplier will be

25

applied and number 2, as I understand it in this case the

1

State has an appeal which the State does not normally have

2

in the traditional model, so we're somewhere in between,

3

it seems to me, here.

4
5

MR. GARDNER:

I don think so, and let me, if I

can, take them one at a time.

6

As to the first point, the point that although

7

the jury is making -- the fact-finder is making a binary

8

determination ultimately there's discretion at sentencing

9

to choose from among the various sentencing options -QUESTION:

10

And in fact I -- perhaps I didn't

11

speak properly on that.

12

than that, isn't it?

13

that can decide for policy reasons that in fact the so-

14

called strike scheme shouldn't apply?

15

The discretion is even greater

I mean, is it the judge or the jury

MR. GARDNER:

One of them can.

Well, with respect to all sentence

16

enhancement allegations in California, whether it's a

17

current conduct enhancement such as firearm use or great

18

bodily injury, or a strikes allegation, there's a right to

19

a jury, and the jury, or the judge if a jury is waived, is

20

the fact-finder for purposes of making the determination

21

as to whether the State has presented in -- sufficient

22

evidence.

23

QUESTION:

But isn't -- even beyond sufficiency

24

of evidence, isn't there also a discretionary element

25

somewhere?

MR. GARDNER:

1

After the fact-finding stage,

2

where the jury or the judge, if a jury is waived, makes

3

the determination that yes, the firearm use has been

4

proved, or yes, the strike allegation has been proved.

5

The judge has discretion under California law, under

6

section 1385, to dismiss that in the interests of justice.

That may be what Your Honor is referring to.
QUESTION:

Okay.

discretion than we find in any trial.

10

MR. GARDNER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GARDNER:

13

Well, actually --

Normal trial scheme.
Actually, under California law it

isn't, judge -- I'm sorry, Your Honor -- because --

14
15

That's a much broader

QUESTION:

Don't worry, I don't regard it an

insult.

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. GARDNER:

It isn't because what we see in

18

trials on substantive offenses in California is that very

19

same power under section 1385.

20

distinguishes a trial on a sentence enhancement allegation

21

from a trial on a substantive offense under California

22

law.

23

QUESTION:

That in no way

You mean, if someone is charged with

24

armed robbery and the case is proved and so on the judge

25

can say, well, I think in the interest of justice this

should be dismissed?
MR. GARDNER:

2

3

The judge, under California law,

can dismiss any allegation in the interests of justice.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. GARDNER:

6

QUESTION:

Really.
So in that sense --

Okay, so we're back to my original

7

two.

8

original two, the two distinctions from the normal --

9
10

I put you off your argument.

MR. GARDNER:

Yes.

We're back to my

You may be, Your Honor, but

I have forgotten.

11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

Okay.

Fair enough.

I said there's

13

discretion in the sentencing function in deciding, sort of

14

the basic sentence to which the multiplier will be

15

applied, and secondly there's a State appeal.

16

MR. GARDNER:

Yes.

As to the first of those,

17

there is discretion, when we come to sentencing, for the

18

trial court to choose among the appropriate sentences, and

19

yes, that is not a binary decision.

20

traditional, normative decision that is made at sentencing

21

hearings, and I'm not suggesting for a moment double

22

jeopardy applies to that situation.

23

That is the

What I am suggesting is that in the separate

24

hearing, and often it's combined directly with the trial

25

on guilt or innocence, when the jury has reached a verdict

1

on a firearm use allegation or on a strike allegation,

2

that binary determination, yes, the defendant had a gun,

3

no, the defendant didn't have a gun, or yes, you've proven

4

the strike, no you didn't, it's that binary determination

5

to which double jeopardy applies.

6

QUESTION:

Okay, so in fact you're --

7

QUESTION:

In -- go ahead.

8

QUESTION:

I was just going to -- you're arguing

9

for something a little different, I guess, from what was

10

involved in Bullington, because I thought -- I thought in

11

Bullington the sentencing proceeding was regarded as one,

12

in effect, unitary proceeding, and you're now saying,

13

well, there are two subparts of the sentencing proceeding.

14

Double jeopardy applies to one but not to the other.

15

QUESTION:

May I --

16

MR. GARDNER:

I think as a -- as a matter of the

17

facts of Bullington, it turned out that they were the

18

same, the jury's sentence, both on -- the factual

19

determination and the sentence was the same, but I think

20

that the critical component, if I had to break them out,

21

would be the binary determination of fact that was made,

22

and that's made here.

It's --

23

QUESTION:

24

were through with your answer.

25

May I -- excuse me.

I thought you

May I ask you, if you can do it in just a

sentence or two, because I don't want to take too much of

2

your time, to state the argument you would have made if we

3

hadn't decided Almendarez the other way a few days ago?

4

MR. GARDNER:

If Almendarez-Torres had been

5

decided differently, or perhaps not been here, I probably

6

would have placed a greater significance on the fact

7

that -- the additional exposure to punishment that a

8

client faces under a three strikes or a firearms

9

allegation is so high that that in itself should --

10

11

QUESTION:

And it cannot be imposed unless this

critical finding is made by the fact-finder.

12

MR. GARDNER:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, that's right, Your Honor.

Mr. Gardner, even though Almendarez-

14

Torres has been decided, isn't it possible -- all that

15

said is that recidiv -- it doesn't say that recidivism

16

laws must be nonelements.

17

and isn't it open to us to find that even if the State

18

calls it a sentencing enhancement, if, in fact, it is

19

treating it with a separate jury trial beyond the

20

reasonable doubt finding and what-not, in fact it's not

21

just a sentencing enhancement.

22

It just says that they may be,

In fact, the State is treating it as an element

23

of the offense, and if it is an element of the offense,

24

then by reason of normal double jeopardy principles and

25

not the invention of some new double jeopardy application

to things that aren't elements of the offense, your client

2

would be entitled not to be tried again.

5

MR. GARDNER:

I agree, and that's precisely the

argument I'm trying to make.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't think you made the

6

argument -- no, you've never come out and confronted the

7

State and said, even though they say it's an enhancement,

8

it's not an enhancement, it's actually an element.
MR. GARDNER:

Then let me state it now, if I

10

haven't before.

11

enhancement, or whether they call it trial, is of no

12

moment to the double jeopardy analysis.

13

The label that's attached, whether it's

What's important in the double jeopardy analysis

14

are three things.

additional punishment, does it have the hallmarks of

trial, particularly proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and

is it a binary determination?

QUESTION:

1

2

So you're not relying on any one

case, then?

3

MR. GARDNER:

No.

I think one of the problems

4

with some of the double jeopardy cases, or the analysis,

5

is that there are a number of different policies on which

6

the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated, so it isn't

7

always possible to rely on one case to establish or set

8

forth a framework.
I'm trying to pull from the Court's precedents

9
10

what I see happening, and that is, in the due process

11

cases, Specht, and Chandler, and Chewning, the Court said,

12

this is a new fact that exposes you to additional

13

punishment, so we're not going to treat it like

14

traditional sentencing, and I'm suggesting that take that

15

analysis into the double jeopardy context, because at some

16

level I think it makes sense.

Well, but what do you do with a due

MR. GARDNER:

Well, I don't think Pearce --

Pearce -QUESTION:

Pearce says you can get a tougher

sentence on resentencing.
MR. GARDNER:

Yes.

I have no problem with that.

24

The difference between this case and Pearce, of course, is

25

what the State is suggesting here is that despite the fact

that it had one full bite at the apple and presented

2

insufficient evidence, which is conceded, they get another

3

trial.

4

QUESTION:

Well, that's not the only difference.

5

Pearce also didn't involve a sentence that -- a fact that

6

increased the sentence to which the defendant was exposed.

7

It was all within the range of the original crime.

8

MR. GARDNER:
QUESTION:

Well, that, too --

That's crucial, that if you're going

10

to say, even though this looks like an enhancement, it

11

smells like an enhancement, it's not an enhancement.

12

seems to me not only because we gave it a jury trial, but

13

also because the effect of the fact found is to increase

14

the criminal liability of the individual.

15

MR. GARDNER:

It

Well, I agree, it is crucial, and

16

that's why the first part --

In no way can a

Oh, so if, in fact, this book had

11

been enacted by Congress rather than delegating the power

12

to the agency, i.e., the commission, then in your view the

Double Jeopardy Clause would apply?

MR. GARDNER:

No.

1

the statute, say, zero to 20 years, and within that, these

2

are factors, and you're saying it's the zero to 20 years

that makes the difference.

MR. GARDNER:

QUESTION:

8

MR. GARDNER:

9

That's part of the difference.

Yes.
That's part of the difference.

What else?
That's the first part.

The second

part is that my understanding of the Sentencing Guidelines

10

is that none of them have the hallmarks of trial in the

11

sense that there's no proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

12

13

Well, that has never been decided, I

mean, I think in this Court.

14

In this Court it hasn't.

The -- all right, hall -- all right.

Now, in

15

California, my understanding is that California did try to

16

adopt a system that they intended to be like the

17

Sentencing Guidelines, but instead of doing it through

18

delegation to a commission, what they did is the set of

19

statutory provisions that we have here.
They give three choices, they -- you know, they

20
21

have low, medium, and high, they build all the things into

22

the statute, just as -- that's my correct understanding,

23

isn't it?

24

MR. GARDNER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

All right.

So why, if this is

1

constitutional, should the effort to -- without double

2

jeopardy, why should the effort of the State legislature

3

to do roughly the same kind of thing through a set of

4

statutes suddenly expose a person to double jeopardy?

5

MR. GARDNER:

Well, the difference isn't between

6

a statute and a regulation, and I'm not suggesting for a

7

moment that the California system of what we call

8

determinate sentencing level, where the judge chooses from

9

2, 3, or 4 years, where choice is within that previously

10
11

prescribed range, are subject to double jeopardy.
What I'm saying is that the very separate

12

factual determination which exposes someone to 25 years to

13

life in addition to that 4 years, that's imposed on top of

14

the 4 years and that could not be imposed in the absence

15

of a finding, that binary determination is subject to the

16

Double Jeopardy Clause.

17

QUESTION:

Can you tell me --

QUESTION:

Mr. Gardner, you don't think that

19

this Court would have permitted judges to participate in

20

the drafting and promulgation of the guidelines if they

21

were functionally the same as legislation, do you?

Actually, I'd rather not express

an opinion on that.

MR. GARDNER:

That's certainly not an issue in

this case.

QUESTION:

May I ask you this.
the trial judge says,

2

defendant is not subject to the anguish, the agony of

3

having to go back before a sentencing judge and think he

4

might get more.

5

MR. GARDNER:

Certainly, I think that there's a

6

component of finality in the Double Jeopardy Clause.

I

7

think it's the primary purpose of the Double Jeopardy

8

Clause, but putting together this Court's decisions in

9

Bullington and DiFrancesco, I think what we get is that

10

one of the things the Double Jeopardy Clause protects is

11

the reasonable expectation of the finality of the parties.

12

On DiFrancesco, the Court looked at the

13

existence of a statute which said, you can -- Government,

you have the right to appeal a sentence.

Mr. Gardner, it would help me to put

Yes, Your Honor.

To a crime called what, assault with

under the California scheme, to additional punishment.

4

What exposes you under the California scheme

as -- what triggers the strike provisions if you have a

prior assault is the question of whether you used,

QUESTION:

Wasn't that charged as part of the

indictment in that prior crime?
10

MR. GARDNER:

QUESTION:

MR. GARDNER:

In the original assault?

Yes.
It was not either charged or

Now, under California law the

That part was never established,

Your Honor, at this trial, absolutely not.

In an informal colloquy before the hearing, the

QUESTION:

was, the judge said, I'm going to take judicial notice of

2

the conviction, and the conviction was for assault with a

3

deadly weapon.

4

That, in and of itself under California law in

5

over a decade, does not provide sufficient evidence,

6

because there could be aiding and abetting, someone else

7

could have used the weapon, or there could have been an

8

infliction of great bodily injury.

9

Then the court said, is there any other

10

evidence?

The prosecutor said yes, I have a piece of

11

evidence.

I have Exhibit 1.

12

defendant had been convicted of assault, but it did not

provide any evidence that a stick was used or that

That showed that the

That was never introduced into evidence at the

He or she does not.

I did want to talk briefly about one other of
the policies underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause.

As

this Court noted, I think in Burks, one of the other chief
10

policies is the idea of preventing the State from refining

11

there are good reasons for reserving or limiting, I should

that Bullington is self-limiting, that Bullington does not

QUESTION:

Right, but if you relied just on

that, and we only decided that, then it would leave open

the question whether your statute would be valid as

because California restricts the aggregating prior

an ordeal that extends until the conclusion of the guilt

determination.

not entirely precise as to the basis of the judge's

There was a charge of a prior assault with a

In our view, however, that entire analysis is

I would also like to describe the nature of this

proceeding, because the petitioner's argument is that if

9

it looks sufficiently like a trial on guilt or innocence,

10

it is a trial on guilt or innocence, notwithstanding the

11

fact that guilt has been resolved prior to the hearing in

12

this case, and therefore and argue the Double Jeopardy

behind the defendant at the time of sentencing.

3

There is no process here that is comparable to

4

the determination of guilt or innocence, and in our view

5

that also distinguishes this case from Bullington v.

6

Missouri, and that is to say that in Bullington, of

7

course, the Court held that the jury's decision to

8

sentence the defendant to life in a capital case
constitutes an acquittal of death.
And Justice Souter, I would agree with your

10

11

observation, or the suggestion in your question, that the

12

inquiry in Bullington ultimately was, is there evidence of

13

the sole issue the jury decides, namely death or life, and

14

I submit that is a fundamentally different issue, because

15

in this case, unlike in the capital context, the jury in

16

the petitioner's case was not the sentencer.

the other side is that it's a fact that must be charged,

it's a fact which is historical in nature as to which the

jury has to say yes or no, it's a fact that has to be

So it seems to me that it's difficult on your

side for that reason to say, we can draw an easy

categorical distinction.

10

MR. GLASSMAN:

The distinction that we would

11

draw, though, Justice Souter, is that in Bullington the

12

Court attaches significance to the fact that the only

13

choice in the sentence is the choice made by that trier of

14

fact, and in this case that is -- it is true that is the

15

only choice the jury makes, but that is not the choice

that ultimately or definitively decides the sentence.

QUESTION:

Well, do you take the position that

19

in California, for example, Bullington wouldn't apply

20

because the sentencer can always say, well, for reasons of

21

justice I'm not going to apply this?

22

MR. GLASSMAN:

Of course not, Your Honor, but

My point

is that it is the judge in California in this noncapital

context who arrives at the sentence.

3

The judge decides to apply either the lower, the

4

middle, or the aggravated term, and the judge decides

5

whether to allow the strike, so it is -- it seems to me

it's fundamentally different than in Bullington, in which

the jury's decision decides the entire event in the

sentencing --

QUESTION:

Well, you're certainly right there.

10

Going back to an earlier colloquy, if the argument had

been made here that in fact that was an element because --

for the reasons I just ticked off, it seems to have some

element characteristics, would you agree that there might

be a reason for - - a very good reason for coming out

15

against you, not on the Bullington reason but, in fact, on

16

the reasoning that what is really being charged here is an

element, whether it's called that or not, so we might get

18

the Bullington result for a different reason?

MR. GLASSMAN:

I think -- I guess that I would

MR. GLASSMAN:

I believe that's the lesson of

Bullington, Your Honor.

4

holding in Bullington is that it is unique to the death

5

penalty process to carry over, or that the offense

6

consideration survives, and returning to the Court's

7

opinion in Caspari v. Bohlen, the Court there has

8

suggested that it is that uniqueness.

I believe that the Court's

It is the

uniqueness that Bullington describes as arising out of

11

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.

12

MR. GLASSMAN:

And the sentencing discretion

13

that is required, or certainly more important in the

14

capital phase, is not at issue in this case, and that is

15

why, in our view, when Justice Blackmun's majority opinion

16

in Bullington described a hallmarks penalty trial as

17

unique, he was referring to the uniqueness of the context

18

of that case.

1

analytically how one could be acquitted of a sentence and

2

that is, of course, the petitioner's argument, that this

3

is somehow an acquittal, as though, if he is correct, the

4

State would be foreclosed from alleging a future

5

recidivism action, for example, or that in the context of

6

a death penalty case, if the sole aggravator was another

7

criminal offense, the acquittal, or the decision of life,

8

would constitute an acquittal of that future crime.

9

For these reasons, because this case fits

10

squarely within the recidivism context, or the sentencing

11

context, I believe that the Court's description in Caspari

12

is significant here, and that is, the Court has observed

13

in Caspari, which has been minimalized as a Teague v. Lane

14

case, but in fact I think the Teague analysis is not

15

irrelevant here when the Court in Caspari says that the

16

determination, the prior determination of a sentence is an

17

objectively verifiable fact, based upon readily available

18

evidence.

QUESTION:

But Teague doesn't apply to a case

coming from a State court, Mr. Glassman.
MR. GLASSMAN:

No, no, I'm not suggesting that

the Teague analysis controls the case or is determinative,

opinion clearly says that the Court's prior precedents had

2

gone in exactly the opposite direction.

3

I think that that observation in Caspari was

4

correct, as was the Court's observation in Caspari, unlike

5

the concerns in the double jeopardy context, that when

6

dealing with noncapital sentencing, and particularly the

7

prior offender, there is an increased accuracy in

8

verifying the record in the prior case.

12

MR. ROBERTS:

They wouldn't be bound

necessarily, because there would be a question of whether

this determination in the sentencing context has all

QUESTION:

No, I mean -- you know, I mean, what

1

determinations, that it's a new -- that the State has a

2

new chance to establish that true finding.

3

traditionally the case that that would bind the State in

4

future cases.

5

QUESTION:

It has been

The State loses the first time in the

6

sentencing proceeding, where the issue is what happened on

7

the night of July 5, 1988, at 6:00 in the morning, did he

8

have a gun or not, and then he commits another crime, and

9

in sentencing it becomes relevant again, and the State

10

isn't bound, they can bring it up again, try and get him

11

again?

12

MR. ROBERTS:

My understanding, from what the

13

California supreme court stated to be the rule, is that

14

that's -- that the case with recidivist findings is that

15

the findings may be alleged again in future proceedings.

16

QUESTION:

Clause issue there?

18

Do you think there's a Due Process

MR. ROBERTS:

There certainly might be

19

limitations under the Due Process Clause on what would be

20

permissible, but that -- you know, obviously that's not

21

the question here.

22

QUESTION:

That hasn't -Well, DiFrancesco talked about an

23

expectation of finality, and pointed out that there the

24

defendant knew that there was a proceeding where the

sentence could be appealed and that there might be more

1

hearings, but if you have a procedure in which the

2

sentence is final, the appellate court affirms the

3

sentence, and then there's some proceeding, new proceeding

4

to reopen it, it seems to me that that does maybe indicate

5

that an expectation of finality is being disappointed.

6

That's not this case, I don't think.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

8

Correct, it's not this case,

Justice Kennedy, and we would submit that the expectation
of finality that's created only goes so far as the State

10
11

law that creates it.
I think it's important to recognize that the

12

rule advanced by petitioner that trial-like hallmarks at

13

sentencing automatically triggers a bar on resentencing

14

places too little value on society's interest in accurate

15

and appropriate punishment, and too great a value on

16

defendant's interest in finality.

17

And it's been pointed out, it might discourage

18

States from providing procedural protections at

1

sentencing, because they wouldn't be free to do so without

20

also triggering double jeopardy protection.

21

Finally, just to briefly address the issue that

22

came up on the question of Almendarez-Torres.

23

to the fact that it hasn't been argued here, I think it

24

would be inappropriate -- for the same reason that it

25

would be inappropriate to have a rule that triggered

In addition

1

double jeopardy by the procedural protections, it would be

2

inappropriate to have a rule that said that the State has

3

to make things an element of the offense when it decides

4

it wants to provide certain procedural protections,

5

because that's forcing it to trade off its interests in

6

accurate and appropriate punishment against its decision

7

to afford defendant certain protections to make the

8

sentencing proceeding more fair.

9

In essence, the reading of Bullington that's

10

advanced by petitioner here is as unworkable and unwise as

11

it is unwarranted by precedent and principle, and we would

12

ask that the Court should affirm the judgment of the

13

California supreme court.
