CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Very well, Mr. Weinhaus.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF S. SHELDON WEINHAUS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WEINHAUS:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case, Mr. Geissal, who is now dead, was

11
12

terminated from his employment by Moore Medical

13

Corporation at a time when he had cancer and was dying of

14

cancer.

15

at the same time his wife had always carried health

16

insurance coverage with her own employer which covered

17

dependents, including Mr. Geissal.

18

He was offered immediately COBRA continuation and

He was allowed to continue to make COBRA

19

payments for 6 months, when all of a sudden Moore Medical

20

announced that it was not responsible for his health

21

insurance coverage, they wrongly accepted COBRA payments,

22

they would pay him back, and they would not pay any of his

23

bills.

24
25

This case was brought, using the wording of the
statute, and the wording is simple, and that's where we

start with, that coverage must be offered to the

2

individual of the same quality as given to employees, and

3

that would be true -- if employees got dual coverage, he

4

would be entitled to dual coverage, required to offer the

5

same policy, and it must extend for at least the period

6

beginning on the date of the qualifying event and ending

7

not earlier than the earliest of the following, and one of

8

them is, when -- the date on which he becomes -- first

9

becomes qualified after the date of election for further

10

insurance.
Now, in this instance, Moore Medical Corporation

11
12

took the position that he first became, after the date of

13

election, covered by the wife's policy and therefore was

14

not entitled to the coverage.

15

ensued.
QUESTION:

16

At that point, litigation

Mr. Weinhaus, would you explain to me

17

what your client stands to recover now?

18

Geissal's medical expenses actually paid by the other

19

policy?

20

MR. WEINHAUS:

Were Mr.

We know some of them were paid.

21

We do not know whether all of them were paid.

22

understanding, some were not paid, but unfortunately in

23

this case what the magistrate judge did is, after denying

24

our motion for summary judgment, turned around and, sua

25

2

so there is no record and, while Moore Medical does

3

continuously argue, in the absence of a record, that we

4

lost nothing, we don't think that's true.

claim?

8

MR. WEINHAUS:

9

QUESTION:

Well --

What is the claimed injury now?

MR. WEINHAUS:

10

Is there no

Well, the claimed injury are,

11

amongst other things, we have at least the deductible that

12

we have to pay for, and we have to face health care

13

providers who may hereafter bill us.

14

In these cases, in the health insurance field,

15

the health providers do not send the bill to the patient,

16

usually, they send them to the health institution which is

17

paying the bills.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WEINHAUS:

20

How long ago did this death occur?
Well, it now occurred a couple of

years ago, but -QUESTION:

21

But you don't have any bills and we

22

don't know if there's any injury.

MR. WEINHAUS:

We have not been told of any

It's just hard to picture what

MR. WEINHAUS:

Well, what also remains of the

there's no double coverage, and at the same time it says

there is double coverage.

There may be, in fact, double coverage.
We have not gotten that far.

I

Moore says

We are entitled, under ERISA -QUESTION:

I thought the argument was you would

11

not be entitled to double coverage and one aspect of this

12

that I hope you will clarify, you're talking about maybe

13

bills coming in later, but there are insurance policies.

14

You have both insurance policies and were told that the

15

only difference is in the deductible, and is there another

16

difference?

17

What about the cap on total benefits?

MR. WEINHAUS:

Well, there's certainly a

18

difference in the cap on total -- well, there's no

19

difference -- there is and there isn't.

survived, or had he lived, or had he been willing to

MR. WEINHAUS:

2

QUESTION:

He did not live.

He's dead now, and that's all

irrelevant, isn't it,

unless, indeed, the bills presented

are over a million dollars, or over whatever the limit

was.

MR. WEINHAUS:

Yes, but the --

Well, we don't --we have not --

that the magistrate handled that, but presuming that they

Is there a realistic possibility that

they are?
MR. WEINHAUS:

for the Greek trip, that there are.
QUESTION:

But wouldn't -- if he took a trip to

the Greek Islands, wouldn't he know how much that cost?

18

MR. WEINHAUS:

19

Aetna did not pay that.

20

There's a realistic possibility,

QUESTION:

Yes, but -- and we know that
Now, whether Moore --

There's another question I had about

21

how this works is, let's assume he's still -- he's just

22

sick, he's not dead, and he's still working, and he's got

23

this dual coverage.

situations, his employer or the other, or is it -- how is

25

that worked out?

Who pays first in these dual coverage

MR. WEINHAUS:

1

Ordinarily, the rule is, his

2

employer and, as pleaded in the case, and as uncontested

3

in the case, Moore was the primary carrier.

4

pay first and, in fact, even in this case, as --

5

notwithstanding their argument, if Moore was required to

6

pay us the benefit, which is all ERISA allows us in any

7

event, if Moore is required to pay the benefit they have

8

promised to us, and if Aetna's entitled to get from us,

9

then, what Moore has paid us in reimbursement, in

Moore would

11

deductible.
Aetna would have to pay us whatever our premiums

cost to make sure that we would not have that.

14

15

Aetna would be -- would have to submit to that.

16

We do have

Even if it's a small claim, it still exists, and

QUESTION:

All right.

Your claim, as I

17

understand it, is, at a minimum, the claim for the Greek

18

Island trip, which Aetna has not yet paid.

19

MR. WEINHAUS:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

And number 2, I think your answer is,

21

assuming, though it didn't get raised explicitly by

22

anybody, that there's nothing in the COBRA act which

23

provides that -- your answer may be assuming that there's

24

nothing in the COBRA act that provides that COBRA coverage

25

will be secondary coverage, necessarily.

MR. WEINHAUS:

2

COBRA coverage will be secondary.

3

must be of the same quality as offered to regular

employees, and the same quality offered to regular

5

employees is that Moore will be primary.
QUESTION:

6

There is nothing that provides

Okay.

In fact, COBRA says it

Then I take it it's fair to

7

say that the situation we're in on standing is this.

QUESTION:

MR. WEINHAUS:

That's a fair statement.

Okay.
It has not been developed because

15

of the decision of the magistrate to grant summary

judgment sua sponte.

QUESTION:

Mr. Weinhaus --

18

QUESTION:

Well, but you claim you have a claim.

19

MR. WEINHAUS:

We certainly claim we have a

20

claim, and we know it's at least of the deductible amount,

21

plus whatever premiums they say we would have had to pay.
QUESTION:

this.

That was his major concern.

But he's now dead, as Justice Scalia

The statute provides for attorney's

5

MR. WEINHAUS:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

Is that an element that stays on,

7

that -- you have the argument that the deductible, you'd

8

have to -- you're out of pocket the extra $350, but then

9

you'd have to pay back the premiums to Moore, which amount

10

to in excess of $2,500, so you net -- you'd be a net

11

loser, unless what you're saying is, if we prevail, then

12

we get our attorney's fees from the beginning of this

13

representation.

14

MR. WEINHAUS:

Well, not only that, but I don't

15

think -- I think we're entitled to the entire benefit.

it comes out to $120,000 --

could you say, yeah, we still have a claim.

If

It's her

It's her claim to get her counsel fees paid.
MR. WEINHAUS:

And in addition to that, though,

21

Your -- that's correct, but in addition to that, she has

22

the right to say, I want the whole benefit, $120,000.

23

It's true, Aetna may say to me, give us back 80, give us

24

back 110, or give us back everything, except we're going

25

to pay you what you had to pay in addition.

No.

This is health insurance

4
5

This was a death benefit?

QUESTION:

Well, why would you be paid $120,000

in a lump sum?
MR. WEINHAUS:

6

Well, it's my understanding --

7

again, these are from off-the-record statements of

8

counsel, is that they paid -- that Aetna paid $120,000.

MR. WEINHAUS:

To health care providers, to

hospitals, to doctors.
QUESTION:

12

13

To whom?

And you think you have a right to

obtain that?

14

MR. WEINHAUS:

What ERISA says is that you're

15

not entitled to any damages.

16

besides fees, and there are penalties too here, that you

17

are entitled to the benefit, and if we're entitled to 120

18

from Moore, we're entitled to 120 from Moore.

19

You are only entitled to --

claim in any way, and every other employee of Moore would

2

have the same right to make that same claim if Moore did

3

not pay the bills and some secondary carrier that they

4

also had paid the bill.

5

that's real -QUESTION:

6

We're the same as them, and

I guess the issue on that would be

7

whether there's standing when somebody brings a claim

8

which is confronted with a counterclaim of a greater

9

amount than the claim, is there still standing to be the

10

claim.

I suppose there is.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WEINHAUS:

13

Well, there are also penalties,

because -QUESTION:

14
15

You mentioned penalties, and are --

Are those penalties that go into the

pocket of the plaintiff?
MR. WEINHAUS:

16

Oh, yes, those are penalties that

17

go into the pocket of -- because our theory is, on that,

18

is that if you do not give a proper notice under the

19

statute you're -- this employer is subject to a penalty of

20

up to $100 a day for not giving a proper notice, and

are correct that they should have continued the policy, at

2

that point in time we are entitled to a penalty of up to

3

$100 a day being assessed, and that goes to the plaintiff,

4

and at the time they announced this, Mr. Geissal was very

5

much alive and very much concerned about having the

6

wherewithal to survive, if he could.

7
8

QUESTION:

Are you going to get to the merits,

do you think?
(Laughter.)

9

MR. WEINHAUS:

10

Well, the merits of it are, of

11

course, in the plain meaning of the statute itself, Your

12

Honor, because he was covered already under the wife's

13

policy, the TWA health insurance plan at the time.

14

Now, we are told by the Eighth Circuit that that

15

plan did not become effective until after his election.

16

Now, that is not correct at all, because under ERISA a

17

plan becomes effective when you're covered.

18

Under ERISA, as he would be a beneficiary in the

19

wife's plan, he would be entitled to sue immediately for

20

any plan violation.

by Moore, or, worse yet, with the date of his election.
QUESTION:

2

3

Why don't you focus on the exact

statutory language that you're relying on, Mr. Weinhaus.

4

MR. WEINHAUS:

Yes.

The exact statutory

5

language is -- appears on page 23 of our brief.

It's --

6

basically says the coverage must extend for at least the

7

period beginning on the date of the qualifying event --

8

now, that is the date of termination -- and ending not

9

earlier than the earliest of the following, the date on

10

which the qualified beneficiary first becomes after the

11

date of election.
Now, he -- therefore, under this statute he is

12

13

immediately covered -- as long as he chooses to elect, he

14

is immediately covered from the date of his termination.

15

Under COBRA, the employer must give you a notice of

16

election, right to elect, within 45 days of the qualifying

17

event.

18

make the election, and then the individual has yet another

19

90 days to pay the premium.

20

The employer must give the individual 60 days to

And, incidentally, COBRA'S not a free gift.

21

Under the statute it's 102 percent of the employer's cost

22

and as a result, upon his death he immediately becomes

23

covered if he ultimately elects, and none of these cases

24

go into the fact that in fact this coverage continues

25

until at least the date of the election, because it says,

here that it retains the status quo, but it really doesn't

always retain the status quo, because it could be that the

additional coverage was acquired after the termination

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, that's correct.

QUESTION:

And you explain this as a glitch.

They just didn't do it quite right.
MR. FELDMAN:

I wouldn't say it's a glitch.

I

16

would say that that was a consequence, a necessary

17

consequence, and one that Congress would have wanted, of

18

their decision to hinge everything from the date of

19

election and not from the date of the termination.

20

The date of termination only sets the notice

21

requirements going in.

It's the date of election that

22

determines -- that you're supposed to look at to determine

23

when coverage -- when you can terminate coverage.

24

Having done that, they can't -- there's no way

25

to be sure that somebody in the position of the decedent

here at the date that -- let's say -- let's take someone

2

who loses their job on day 1.

3

On day 2, they go get another job.

The employer

4

says, do you want health insurance, I don't have much of a

5

policy but we have something to offer you, and the

6

employee says, sure.

7

On -- 30 days later the employee gets a notice

8

that you're entitled to COBRA coverage, and you have 60

9

days to elect, blah, blah, blah.

10

Well, in that case, under respondent's view,

11

because the employee has already accepted coverage under

12

the new job, before he knew the consequences of doing

13

that, he can't get COBRA coverage or at least it would

14

have to terminate right at the day of election.

15

Now, I think that that's a consequence that

16

Congress didn't want.

Congress --

Well --

You posed the case where there was

significantly less insurance under the new policy.
MR. FELDMAN:

Let me -- that is a view -- the

significant gap explanation is one that's been adopted by

the courts of appeals that have agreed with respondent in

the courts below.
And they've done that because they realize that

3

Congress generally didn't intend the harsh consequences of

4

someone who was,

5

and let's say a family may have been relying very heavily

6

on the employee's insurance and had a supplemental policy

7

also that the spouse had, and those courts have felt,

8

well, Congress couldn't have intended that they lose their

9

primary health coverage just because -- when they

let's say relying on their own insurance

10

terminate their job just because they have some very

11

inadequate coverage under the spouse's policy,

look at whether there's a significant gap.

The way that the problem is

QUESTION:

4

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

The way that the

problem is resolved is by giving the employee the

opportunity to elect.

7

other policy is inadequate, the employee will probably

8

elect COBRA coverage and the employee is entitled to get

9

it.

10

If the employee believes that the

If the employee believes that the other coverage

11

is fully adequate, then the employee certainly will not

12

elect COBRA coverage because it's expensive.

15

QUESTION:

But the point is, he is in a position

to assess whether there's a gap or not.
MR. FELDMAN:

Right, and he's also in -- I might

16

add that if you look at the significant gap inquiry, it's

17

very hard to work, because the plan administrator has to

18

make the determination sometime after the date of election

19

of comparing the provisions of the two policies.

20

The plan administrator has to know the

21

provisions of the other policy, which the plan

22

administrator may well not have, has to know the medical

23

condition of the decedent to determine whether, in light

24

of that -- not of the decedent, of the employee in most

25

cases, to determine whether, in light of that, the gap is

significant.
That's an inquiry that's very difficult to make.

3

Under our view, Congress left -- the statute works quite

4

well where those decisions are left up to the employee.

5

In our view also the plain language of the

6

statute is sufficient to resolve the case.

7

says that the employer may terminate coverage on the date

8

on which the qualified beneficiary first becomes, after

9

the date of election, covered under any other plan.

10

QUESTION:

The statute

Would your argument be the same -- it

11

wouldn't be as good, but would you take the same position

12

if it said,

13

first is covered?

MR. FELDMAN:

I think argument would be the

14

same, but I do think that becomes is the word that really

15

makes it unambiguous.

16

becomes is probably stronger than first, but I think when

17

operating together they plainly convey the meaning that

18

Congress intended here.

19

Or, put it the other way,

I think

If you -- if a plan administrator asks, on the

20

date after the date of election says, has this employee

21

today first become covered under any other plan,

22

the only possible answer is no.

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct.

That's correct.

8

But the -- that's correct.

9

the major part of the weight, and I do think first adds to

10
11

It's the becomes is -- carries

it.
But in any event, because on the date after the

12

date of election it cannot be said that the employee has

13

first become covered under the other plan, and that won't

14

be true at any other future date if there's continuous

15

coverage, the employer cannot terminate COBRA coverage

16

on -- just right after the date of election on the basis

17

that the employee has first become covered by a plan that

18

he had, in fact, all along.

19

In our view, that fits well within the purposes

20

of the statute because, as I said, it provides -- it

21

enables employees who are relying on that coverage and who

22

may have had wholly inadequate second coverage to make the

23

decision of what kind of coverage is adequate for them,

24

and to have that for this temporary period of time for up

other plans they wanted.
In response -- I just want to add, because I do

2

3

think that the hardest case for us is the case where the

4

employee -- the case that Justice Scalia raised, which is

5

where the employee gets the coverage during the election

6

period, that really it's necessary to allow that to

7

happen, because that is the only -- the only way that

8

Congress could ensure itself that an employee, when it

9

made an election with respect to the new policy, when it

10

decided it wanted the coverage -- when he decided he

11

wanted coverage under the new policy, it was the only way

12

that Congress could be sure that that was an informed

13

choice.

14

And it's also clear from the general structure

15

of the statute that Congress wanted those -- the employee

16

to have that choice.

17

the 65th day, or the 70th day, long after the date of

18

election, and an employee who is covered under COBRA gets

19

a new job, well, at that point, when the new employer

20

says, do you want health insurance under this job, or

21

health coverage, the employee is not -- just because he's

22

offered the health insurance, COBRA coverage doesn't

23

terminate.

For example, when a -- let's take on

1

new plan, and that shows that Congress wanted people to

2

have the opportunity to make the choice as to whether they

3

wanted the COBRA coverage or whether they wanted the new

4

coverage.

5

If you adopt the view of respondent and the

6

court of appeals, the employees wouldn't have that choice

7

very frequently.

8

I think our view is also supported by related

9

provisions of COBRA which provide, for example, that the

10

coverage that's provided under COBRA has to be identical

11

to the coverage that the employee had while working for

12

the former employer, and it's consistent with that purpose

13

to permit employees who had dual coverage, who felt it was

14

necessary because of extraordinary medical needs, because

15

of the inadequacy of a spouse's plan, or perhaps just

16

because of their own very strong desire to have security

17

with respect to their medical costs, to permit employees

18

who are in that situation who had dual coverage before for

19

sometime, to be able to also continue the dual coverage

20

during the temporary COBRA period so long as they're

21

willing to pay for it.

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, because it is

5

jurisdictional, can you explain why the Eighth Circuit

6

thought the 54(b) issue -- they said it was -- they

7

considered it a close question, and then didn't expand on

8

it, whether there was an immediately appealable judgment,

9

final judgment -MR. FELDMAN:

10

I don't understand why they said

11

that, because in looking at it myself I didn't see why it

12

was a close question, so in my view it was a valid 54(b)

13

certification and therefore it was validly before the

14

court of appeals.

15

QUESTION:

I note that Count IV is discrete.

16

That was for the information reporting.

seemed to me that the issues that were before the court,

II was.

MR. WASHBURN:

10

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I believe that the petitioner's argument in this

14

of course, has already been addressed by the Court's

questions, concerning the blatant attempt at double

I know it concerns you, but our basic

problem is to decide this particular case.

MR. WASHBURN:

4

QUESTION:

5

Right.

And how is it relevant to our

problem?
MR. WASHBURN:

6

Well, I think that you have to

7

look at the statute, and the statute as a whole, and we

8

have to -- based upon a holistic look at the statute, have

9

to determine the intent of Congress, and I don't believe

10

that Congress was trying to protect people and allow them

11

to, in essence, win a medical lottery.
If they're entitled to a double recovery,

12

13

everybody who is sick, or even people who aren't sick

14

really would -- should elect COBRA --

15

QUESTION:

I don't quite see that, because I

16

thought most insurance policies have in them clauses so

17

that you can't get a double recovery, and one way is, they

18

may have to pay the money back.

that prevent that.

That's certainly -- but it is certainly a problem with

this.
The other matter that's so disingenuous to my

3
4

way of thinking is, is complaints about the status of the

5

record.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, if you start out

7

saying, this is disingenuous, they don't want double

recovery, and then you tell us there's not going to be

double recovery, it seems to me that your opening salvo is

10
11

rather ineffective.
MR. WASHBURN:

I'm sorry, Justice.

I think that

12

it is important that they don't be -- that they're not

13

entitled to double recovery, and I'm wanting to make sure

14

that they're not entitled to double recovery, because we

certainly don't want to have to end up paying twice.

7

And nothing to do -- if the statute

the rest of this is relevant, because you're not entitled

10

to more than one policy, as you read it.

11

MR. WASHBURN:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice.

You say this statute just protects

13

the person against the loss of any insurance, and that --

14

so you present a stark question of statutory

15

interpretation on which you divide -- you prevailed on

16

your reading, and the rest of it seems to me, as Justice

17

Breyer suggested, not relevant to the question before us,

18

which is what does this provision mean.

19

MR. WASHBURN:

Okay.

I'll address that,

20

Justice.

The -- what the provision means, and to look at

21

it and also -- I'd like to point to the Court on pages 1

22

and 2 of the reply brief of the respondent, they sat there

23

was seriously flawed, and therefore my analysis of what

MR. WASHBURN:

It's simple.

So -So what the point becomes is, is

5

that the exact date of the obtention of this preexisting

policy really doesn't have a whole lot to do with it, and

7

let me give you a hypothetical that may somewhat clear it

up.

9

slightly.

10

Let's change the facts of this situation only

Mr. Geissal was working for Moore Medical.

His

11

wife, instead of being a long-term employee of TWA, became

12

an employee of TWA only 6 months before Mr. Geissal was

13

terminated, and the TWA plan has a 1-year preexisting

14

condition clause.

15

QUESTION:

Your point basically is, don't pay

16

that much attention to the words become after the date of

17

election and first, for the reason that, until the

18

election, there was nothing in effect, so it's natural for

19

Congress to have used those words, since the election

20

created a nothing into a something.

21

MR. WASHBURN:

22

QUESTION:

23

That's correct.

It really has nothing to do with the

issue before us.

Good.

If I

understand that, then, let's go to the question of why

2

Congress might have wanted it, and I take it that the

3

reason they might have wanted this interpretation that the

petitioners have is because they figure all of us -- you

5

know, many people in this room, hundreds of people have

coverage through their employer, their spouse works, he or

And what Congress is interested in, after all,

11

is that when you lose -- when one spouse loses one job,

12

they want a conscious choice, or otherwise you're covered

13

for 18 months.

14

don't make a conscious choice to go choose something else,

15

you're still covered by your employer.

16

conscious choice, the employer should be off the hook.

So during the 18 months period, if you

What's your response?

MR. WASHBURN:

22

Congress were so concerned about the preservation of the

23

If I may, I'd like to finish my -- the

changed the facts, where -- that Mrs. Geissal only went to

it had a 12-month exclusion, so if you take even the

petitioner's position is, he was terminated and 6 months

preexisting condition clause, because 6 months after the

11

qualifying event there is now no longer a preexisting

limitation in the Aetna or TWA plan.

So now, even using his analogy, he obviously

first becomes covered by another group health plan that

10

for a long time on that, but assuming it's the individual,

11

the ill person who has the right to make that election,

12

essentially that just reads away the sub-subsection that

13

we've been talking about.

14

It makes it a nullity.

It takes away the employer's expansive rights

15

and liberal rights to terminate COBRA coverage.

16

totally in the hands of the ill person, and it's not --

17

they can make the election, and it's not that situation.

18

It's now

The gap has to do with whether there's a gap

19

between the policies.

going to be a gap when you have to drop one policy.

QUESTION:

Obviously, you know, there's always

But if there is a significant gap,

in

your view, what happens?
MR. WASHBURN:

Well, under the status of the law

24

basically in the Eighth Circuit if there is a

25

substantial -- if there were a substantial gap, then COBRA

continuation insurance coverage would have to be offered,

and obviously the -- two courts have now held in this case

3

that there was no significant gap, and there is no

significant gap in this case.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF S. SHELDON WEINHAUS

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WEINHAUS:

10

I only have one answer, Justice

11

Ginsburg, to your question as to what law prevails here in

12

terms of how that -- how the coverage should be read, and

13

that's a decision of this Court some years ago, FMC v.

14

Halliday Corporation, in which you held self-insured funds

15

are not subject to State insurance regulations at all.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Weinhaus, could you -- I meant to

17

ask this of Mr. Feldman, too, but maybe you can satisfy

18

me.

19

it makes sense to read first becomes as you do with regard

20

to (i),

21

(ii), first becomes after the date of the election in the

22

case of a qualified beneficiary other than a qualified

23

beneficiary described in section 11 -- of this title,

24

entitled to benefits under medicare.

25

I -- you and he have given some reasons why this --

but the first becomes clause also applies to

Why does it make any sense to say, well,

1

we're -- the -- we're going to allow medicare benefits to

2

eliminate your -- the employer's continuing obligation to

3

give you this coverage, but only if those medicare

4

benefits first become available after the election?

5

What's the reason for that?
MR. WEINHAUS:

6

I do know -- of course, I can't

7

speak to what Congress intended as to medicare, but I do

8

know in the early history, when COBRA was being discussed,

9

that in fact Congress really carved out -- they said first

10

becomes for other insurance, and they left out the first

11

becomes for medicare, so I tend to believe that Congress

12

always believed there was some slight difference between

13

the two and the way it was going to treat it, but I

14

can't --

15

QUESTION:

But they end up treating the two of

16

them the same, and I must say, it doesn't make any sense

17

to me with respect to medicare, since that's mandatory.

18

mean, it's not something you have the option of taking on

19

or not.

MR. WEINHAUS:

21

Justice, we would rest.

If there are no other questions,

Weinhaus.

Thank you, Mr.

The case is submitted.

entitled matter was submitted.)
