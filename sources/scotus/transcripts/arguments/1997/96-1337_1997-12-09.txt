ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERENCE J. CASSIDY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CASSIDY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Deputy Smith is entitled to qualified immunity

11
12

in this case on the grounds that the law regarding

13

substantive due process claims under the Fourteenth

14

Amendment was not clearly established at the time of the

15

police pursuit in this case in May of 1990.

16

In that regard, the legal standard was not

17

sufficiently well-developed, nor were the factual contours

18

of such a claim developed so as to put a reasonable

19

officer in the position of Deputy Smith on notice of what

20

type of conduct would constitute a violation of

21

substantive due process in the context of a police

22

pursuit.

23

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question right at the

24

start, please, Mr. Cassidy?

25

apparently takes the position that a substantive due

1

process violation does arise from a negligently conducted

2

police chase of someone.

3

I mean, you don't raise the question whether

4

there is a substantive due process violation at all.

5

apparently assume there is, and then just want us to

6

decide what standard to apply.

7

that's your position on behalf of the county?

MR. CASSIDY:

You

Do I understand correctly

Justice O'Connor, no, we do not

concede that a negligent claim would support a violation
of substantive due process.
QUESTION:

In fact, we have --

Well, do you concede that on the

12

facts in this case, the police pursuit case before us,

13

that the only inquiry is what standard to apply, because

14

there would be a substantive due process violation?

15

MR. CASSIDY:

The petitioners in this case have

16

asserted that the proper question presented is whether or

17

not -- what -- the proper legal standard to be applied in

18

a claim for substantive due process.

19

briefs which have asserted that no claim lies in this case

20

because of the accidental nature of the conduct involved.

But that's not the position taken by

the county.

Upon reflection, I would agree

with that position as asserted by amici.

briefing.
QUESTION:

So what am I supposed to do?

I mean,

3

you give me two options, that it's a substantive due

4

process violation if it's -- if it shocks the conscience,

5

or if it's grossly negligent conduct.

6

none of the above?

7

MR. CASSIDY:

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11

What if I think

Justice Scalia --

Do I pick grossly negligent conduct

because that's the closest to not having a substantive due
process violation at all?
MR. CASSIDY:

Well, no, Your Honor.

We would

12

respectfully submit that in the event this Court

13

determines to adopt the type of approach it did in

14

Albright v. Oliver and determine that all claims perhaps

15

involving a seizure fall within the Fourth Amendment

16

standards, then there would be no claim available under

17

the Fourteenth Amendment.

18

QUESTION:

Well,

I certainly thought that's what

19

this case was about when I first read about its facts.

20

mean, we've had a number of cases involving police chases

21

and they always come up as unreasonable seizure cases.

22

MR. CASSIDY:

23

QUESTION:

I

And I would --

Lo and behold,

I read this thing and

24

it's somehow a substantive due process violation put in a

25

whole different category of constitutional analysis, and

the city just goes along with that.

2

record in which somebody has asserted that something like

3

this -- a court has held that something of this sort is a

4

substantive due process violation?

5

MR. CASSIDY:

Is there any case on

I believe that the courts of

6

appeal have analyzed the case law involving police

7

pursuits under substantive due process violations, or

8

alleged violations, but if this Court then looks --

9
10

QUESTION:

Certainly nothing in this Court has.

MR. CASSIDY:

Correct, and if this Court were to

11

look at the recent Mays opinion out of the Seventh

12

Circuit, perhaps, and upon reflection by petitioners we

3

would submit that that may be the correct analysis.

4

If only the Fourth Amendment were to apply in

5

this case, then there would be no violation because, in

6

fact, the means that were used to -- or were involved in

7

this accident were not intentionally applied, so there was

8

no seizure.

9

So if this Court is left to analyze it under the

20

Albright analysis, then there would be no violation.

21

Petitioner would prevail.

22

QUESTION:

I certainly -- you know, you cannot

23

expand the First Amendment, for example, by saying, well,

24

this doesn't violate any of our First Amendment law,

25

however, we think this was a deprivation of liberty under

1

the Due Process Clause, apart from the First Amendment.

2

We wouldn't hear something like that.

3

MR. CASSIDY:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. CASSIDY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Why should we do it for the Fourth?
Upon reflection, petitioners would

6

submit that it should not be so expanded, and that perhaps

7

the analysis by this Court in DeShaney v. Winnebago is the

8

correct analysis, that in fact, if this Court were to

9

allow the claim for substantive due process to go forward,

10
11

it would substantially disrupt the political process.
As this Court's noted in DeShaney as well as in

12

the recent Collins decision and the Washington v.

13

Glucksberg, the political process is extremely important

14

to allow the States to develop the appropriate law.

15

QUESTION:

But could you not have a high speed

16

chase that wouldn't involve the Fourth Amendment?

17

example, think back to the days of the Freedom Riders.

18

Suppose there had been State police involved in just

19

following these people on the road to terrorize them for

20

mile after mile, not for the purpose of seizing them for

21

arrest, but to frighten them.

22

appropriate situation for a due process rather than a

23

Fourth Amendment approach?

1

Court, the Fifth Circuit in the Checki v. Webb case did

2

take that approach, and therein lies the basis for the

3

analysis that potentially there could be such a claim.

4

However, I think that what that demonstrates is

5

the fact that in the context of qualified immunity Deputy

6

Smith could not have known, as a reasonable officer in the

7

field, what type of standards should be applied not only

8

at the present time but back in May of 1990, when this

9

pursuit occurred.
QUESTION:

10

Well, do you -- if we assume for the

11

sake of argument that this is properly a substantive due

12

process case and not a Fourth Amendment case, are we

13

supposed to take the case on the assumption that on at

14

least one of the two alternative standards that has been

15

proposed here there is a substantive due process

16

violation?

17

position, but I may be wrong.

18

That seems to be the assumption of the State's

MR. CASSIDY:

No.

I believe there was no

19

violation of substantive due process, regardless of which

20

standard may be adopted by this Court.

21

QUESTION:

So it's not merely a question of, he

22

didn't know which.

We may assume that in fact it would be

23

findable today that there is no substantive due process

24

violation, even assuming that this is a substantive due

25

process case.

1

MR. CASSIDY:

2

QUESTION:

Well, 1), if you assume --

Because usually we don't get wrapped

3

around problems of qualified immunity unless we are at

4

least assuming that now there's a violation, so that's why

5

I want to know whether you are conceding that now, on at

6

least one of these standards, there would be a substantive

7

due process violation.

8

MR. CASSIDY:

No, we are not.

If the Court

determines to reach the issue and make a determination as
10

to what the proper legal standard is, petitioners do not

11

concede, under either standard that has been posited, that

12

in fact there may have been a violation.

13

QUESTION:

I suppose you take the position that

14

there was -- a) there was no violation, but b) if you

15

should find a violation, there was nonetheless qualified

16

immunity.

17

MR. CASSIDY:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Why wasn't this case disposed of on

1

the basis of qualified immunity?

20

said that the courts should make that inquiry first before

21

they move on to decide the constitutional questions, and

22

even if this is a substantive due process violation, it's

23

surely a brand new one, isn't it?

24
25

MR. CASSIDY:

I think our cases have

Well, in fact, Justice Scalia,

petitioners would heartily agree, and in fact the district

1

court did dispose of this matter on behalf of Deputy Smith

2

with respect to the qualified immunity issue, and we

3

believe correctly did so.
We believe that the Ninth Circuit's analysis

4
5

rejects this Court's prior teachings in Harlow and Malley

6

v. Briggs and determines that, under this very gray area

7

of conduct that is sufficiently egregious, that somehow an

8

officer, in the context of the rubric of the Fourteenth

9

Amendment, should have known that his conduct may violate

10

a constitutional right, and we believe that this case

11

should have been disposed of on qualified immunity

12

grounds.

13

In fact, in the recent Linear case, which

14

analogizes to the qualified immunity context, this Court

15

specifically pointed out that when the case law leaves

16

open the general rule to be applied, then it's necessary

17

that there be a very high degree of factual particularity

18

in order to overcome that immunity.

19

In the context of a police pursuit that occurred

20

in May of 1990, no such factual particularity was present.

21

There were several cases that had analyzed this issue.

22

However, in those cases, excepting the Checki v. Webb

23

case, there were no violations found, and only in Checki

24

was there some suggestion there may have been a violation.

25

But circumstances in that case law had involved

1

excessive speeds, traveling too closely, failing to

2

activate lights and sirens, failing to call in by radio,

3

alleged violations of departmental policies, alleged

4

violations of State law, all of which had resulted in a

5

finding of no liability, so certainly the factual contours

6

were not sufficiently developed in May of 1990 to provide

7

and put a reasonable officer on notice that he could be

8

held liable.

9

But in the Malley case, this Court points out

10

that, specifically, if reasonable officers could disagree

11

as to whether there may have been a violation, then the

12

immunity applies, and petitioners respectfully submit that

13

in fact that's exactly what occurred in this case.

14

Reasonable officers could certainly disagree as

15

to whether there was some potential for liability in May

16

of 1990 arising out of the facts and circumstances of this

17

case and the context of alleged violation of substantive

18

due process, and on that basis petitioners respectfully

19

request that this Court find that there was qualified

20

immunity that Deputy Smith is entitled to, and therefore

21

petitioners prevail.

22

If this Court proceeds to analyze what the

23

proper legal standard is with respect to an alleged

24

violation of substantive due process, then petitioners

25

respectfully submit that the standard should be one that

1

is either arbitrary or shocks the conscience.
In that regard, I think it's important to look

2

3

at the policy considerations which may be affected.

4

Specifically, there should be deference given to the

5

political process and the nature of the interests involved

6

in the type of case in the circumstance or in the context

7

of a police pursuit.

8

There's also the impact --

9

QUESTION:

May I ask, on the political process,

10

is it correct that in California the officers are immune

11

for this kind of conduct, even if it's -- no matter how

12

gross?

13

MR. CASSIDY:

You are correct, Justice Stevens,

14

in that the individual officer is immune.

15

entity may be held liable under appropriate circumstances.

16

QUESTION:

In other words, the city might be

held liable.

Correct.

On a respondeat superior type of

approach, or -MR. CASSIDY:

That's correct.

However, they

22

leave the individual officer out of the context of that

23

civil liability, and there is a specific statutory scheme

24

which has been adopted by California that not only allows

25

for the potential for a municipality to be liable in the

1

context of a Code 3 emergent vehicle operation, but also

2

specifically the legislature has adopted a statute that

3

encourages departments in California to adopt an

4

appropriate police or law enforcement agency policy

5

regarding pursuits so as to potentially avoid liability if

6

the accident results from the vehicle operated by the

7

suspect.
QUESTION:

Now, in this case did the plaintiff

sue the county, too?

MR. CASSIDY:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CASSIDY:

Yes.

On State law grounds?
Correct.

Yes.
And a portion of that was

15

dismissed at the district court level and a portion of

16

that was reserved, specifically whether or not the county

17

of Sacramento would be immune from liability under the

18

vehicle code section that provides for the adoption of an

19

appropriate pursuit policy as well as the issue of whether

20

or not it was an accident that resulted from the operation

21

of the suspect's vehicle in this case.

22

I think that if the less stringent standard is

23

adopted by the Court in this case, then it will

24

effectively remove this type of claim from the political

25

process.

This type of claim is appropriate to be resolved

2

by the States in adopting their State tort laws.
Specifically, the persons directly affected,

3

whether it be the -- in the category of suspects or in the

4

category of innocent bystanders, it is clear that the

5

States and those bystanders, being the very electorate

6

that affect the laws of the State, should have a say in

7

whether or not there should be recovery.

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, of course, we don't ordinarily

say that if there's -- when we're trying to interpret a

10

provision of the Constitution that the public ought to

11

have some input on it.

12

and we try to figure out what those who adopted that

13

provision may mean, but we don't generally say that, let's

14

hear what the people have to say about it.

15

MR. CASSIDY:

I mean, certainly we hear argument

But indirectly, Mr. Chief Justice,

16

we do that through our State legislatures, and that is

17

precisely what this Court has looked to to see whether or

18

not States would adopt and should adopt appropriate laws

19

to govern these types of situations, and that's what the

20

Court referred to in Collins, directing to leave this to

21

the area of the local representatives, rather than an

22

interpretation of the charter of the Government for this

23

entire country.

24

as opposed to a political interpretation.

25

Then it becomes a judicial interpretation

But I think Collins first evaluated

1

whether or not there was a substantive due process

2

violation and said no, and said, therefore this is left to

3

the political process.

4

I mean, I think you first have to do your

5

reasoning on the constitutional point, then the result may

6

be that it's left to the political process.

7

MR. CASSIDY:

I understood that was the analysis

8

in the Collins case.

However, we would respect that there

9

should be some deference given to the State political

10

process as explored in the DeShaney decision, because that

11

is important to determine whether this Court will expand

12

its interpretation of claims for substantive violations of

13

due process.

14

QUESTION:

Well, we do it if we first conclude

15

that it is not arbitrary, that whatever the State action

16

was that caused the injury was not arbitrary in the sense

17

of just being beyond the realm of reason as something the

18

State might choose to do, or a governmental actor might

19

choose to do.

20

Is it your argument here -- I take it ultimately

21

it is -- that you simply cannot say that a high speed

22

chase, assuming there is cause to apprehend in the first

23

place, is so totally beyond the realm of reasonable

24

conduct addressing a legitimate governmental object as

25

ever to fall within that arbitrary character.

Is that

your position?
MR. CASSIDY:

Well, I believe that the

3

initiation and continuing of high speed pursuits are not

4

arbitrary, at least in most circumstances.

5

QUESTION:

They may be unwise, but they are not,

6

as it were, so totally beyond the realm of reason as to

7

rise to the level of a substantive due process violation.

8

9

MR. CASSIDY:

I believe that's correct.

There

is a rational purpose, more often than not, I think,

in

10

the substantial number of police pursuits that allow for

11

those pursuits to take place.

12

QUESTION:

Now, how do you distinguish those --

3

and I -- I know I'm mixing apples and oranges here, but

4

how do you distinguish those, your position there from the

5

analysis that occurs in an unreasonable force situation

6

under the Fourth Amendment?

7

Why is -- why can we not say, let's say in

8

unreasonable force cases that, sure, the force is always

9

directed to the consummation of a legitimate governmental

20

object, which is the apprehension of the suspect, or the

21

person for whom there is a warrant.

22

effect dismiss all of those cases on the same analysis?

MR. CASSIDY:

Why don't we in

Well, because I believe that, in

terms of the Bill of Rights and specifically the Fourth

Amendment, that those are directed toward guaranteeing

that would fall within the Fourth Amendment, and -QUESTION:

But would it be fair to say that the

it's clear that by no stretch of the imagination was the

That's correct.

We believe that

the logical extension of shocks the conscience, in terms

of the framework of defining such a claim, would be that

of the language previously adopted by Judge Friendly in

Johnson v. Glick, whether in fact there was conduct on the

Why isn't an attempted seizure subject to the Fourth

presented on the petitions for the writ before this Court

were exactly the same question presented in the reverse,

3

and this Court declined hearing --

6

QUESTION:

Is a denial of certiorari an implicit

approval of anything?
MR. CASSIDY:

No, certainly not authority, Your

7

Honor, but some indication that this Court has approved of

8

that analysis as opposed to this Court's -- the Ninth

9

Circuit's analysis in this case.

10

QUESTION:

Gee, I hope not.

I have voted to

11

deny certiorari in a lot of cases whose analysis I don't

12

approve of.

13

MR. CASSIDY:

Accepted, Your Honor.

14

Quickly, petitioners would prevail because there

15

was no Fourth Amendment claim in this case, so even if

16

this Court were to determine that the Fourth Amendment

17

applied, not only was there no seizure in this case, but

18

no Fourth Amendment claim was asserted.

19

In terms of the factual circumstances,

20

petitioners respectfully submit Deputy Smith was acting

21

appropriately, and that in fact Mr. Lewis did initiate and

22

cause Mr. Willard to proceed and flee from Deputy Smith.

23

Mr. Willard admitted in deposition that he knew

24

Deputy Smith was trying to stop him initially and during

25

the course of the pursuit and if, in fact, this pursuit

1

was coming to a conclusion because these two individuals

2

decided to stop, you don't yield to lawful authority in

3

the middle of the road.

4

The simple fact of the matter is, they crashed

5

the motor cycle in the middle of the road, because had

6

they made good their left-hand turn about a 150 feet down

7

the road or so there's a barrier that would not let police

8

vehicles through but the motor cycle would make good its

9

escape.

10

I think there is a valid justification in the

11

fact that pursuits are conducted and oftentimes result in

12

finding suspects who have committed more serious crimes,

13

and I think that's an important policy consideration that

14

this Court should look to.

15

In addition, with all the discussion we've had

16

here today, petitioners would respectfully submit that it

17

seems clear that Deputy Smith is entitled to qualified

18

immunity on the grounds that the law was clearly not

19

established sufficiently in May of 1990 to hold Deputy

20

Smith liable.

21

Moreover, if this Court determines that there is

22

potentially a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, then

23

we would submit the appropriate legal standard is conduct

24

that shocks the conscience, and Collins is controlling.

25

The cases which fall in between the cracks, so

to speak, are those to be left for the States to decide.

2

That's specifically the type of policy choices that should

3

be made by the people of the various States through their

4

local representatives, but should not be thrust upon them

5

by the judicial expansion of the Due Process Clause of the

6

Fourteenth Amendment.

Thank you.
