ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN W. PRESSMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. PRESSMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code excepts

12

willful and malicious injuries from discharge and the

13

bankruptcy court's finding here that Paul Geiger

14

intentionally administered substandard care and that his

15

action shocked even a person lacking formal medical

16

training met this Court's standards set out in Tinker v.

17

Colwell because his actions constituted a willful

18

disregard of his duty.

19

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Pressman, when you say that

20

there was a finding that he intentionally administered

21

substandard care,

22

that the -- that his standard,

23

he recognized was negligent?

24
25

is that any different than a finding

MR. PRESSMAN:

the standard of care which

The distinction here, Your Honor,

is that Dr. Geiger knew the standard of care.

Dr. Geiger had reached into his bag and pulled out the

19

procedure, we wouldn't have a case.

MR. PRESSMAN:

Your Honor,

let me address that

point.
In Tinker, when Justice Peckham wrote for the

4

Court, he recognized and he - - recognized that the willful

5

and malicious test had two prongs, willful and malicious.

6

When analyzing whether Mr. Colwell -- Mr. Tinker's action

7

was willful, he said the action is willful, not that the

8

injury was willful.

9

it was willful in the view -- in the idea that it was

10

He referred to the action and he said

intentional and deliberate.

11

Dr. Geiger's actions here were intentional.

12

QUESTION:

Well, but the trouble in Tinker was

13

that the act which the defendant performed could not, as a

14

matter of law or as a matter of definition, be performed

15

without the necessary consequence of the kind of injury

16

for which the law allowed recovery.

17

That is not the case here.

The relationship

18

between any deficiency in the doctor's care and the

19

ultimate loss of the leg was not a relationship as a

20

matter of law or as a matter of definition.

21

contingent factual relationship.

22

It was a

It turned out that way, but you can't say,

I

23

think, that at any given moment when he decided to use an

24

oral antibiotic as opposed to an injection or what-not,

25

that there was any kind of legal inevitability to the

consequence for which the plaintiff is seeking to recover

and that,

I think,

is why you have a problem in relying on

But in fact, the relationship is one of

question and Justice Ginsburg's question is, does the term

so -- if that is so, and I - - it seems so, then either the

word willful means to pick up intentional torts,

you might win.

that the statute would like --be intended to make.

3

Now,

I put that to you because I'd like to hear

your response, since I think it's important.

4

MR. PRESSMAN:

I believe that in order to rule

5

in our favor, one has to look at the term willful as

6

meaning the same thing that this Court held,

7

means voluntary.
Dr. Geiger in this case was asked and he knew

8

9

that willful

what he was doing.

His action was intentional.

10

Therefore, we meet the standard, the standard this Court

11

set out.
I don't believe I've answered your question,

12

13

though.

QUESTION:

25

still the law.

QUESTION:

Yes, but now we have a specific

3

provision doing that and,

4

if malpractice should work the

one would expect a similarly specific provision.
MR. PRESSMAN:

5

Our position, Justice Ginsburg,

6

is that the Congress reenacted the identical language in

7

the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 and therefore the same

8

interpretations apply.
If you look to the legislative history, which my

9
10

colleague relies on,

11

overruled.

problem that Tinker was a deliberate trespass on another

It seems to me we call it willful only when the

QUESTION:

I've won that argument?

Mr. Pressman,

I -- I'd like you to

4

comment on this.

5

had it even after reading Tinker, was whether there was

6

redundancy in the statute unless I read it your way, and I

7

decided that there wasn't redundancy in the statute and

8

this is the way I worked it out, and you tell me whether

9

I'm wrong,

One of the questions that I had, and I

or whether Tinker is inconsistent with this.
It's got to be willful and malicious.

10

We start,

11

I guess, with the definition of malicious as the act whose

12

purpose is to harm the third party.

13

willful adds anything to that sense of malicious.

14

can't be any worse than that.

15

I don't suppose
You

But there's also a sense of malicious in which,

16

although you do not personally have a purpose or an animus

17

to hurt the victim, what you do inevitably will hurt the

18

victim, and I think that's what was going on in Tinker.

19

In that sense of malicious,

the word willful

20

does add something, because if you take willful there to

21

mean,

22

knows the inevitability of it and he does it anyway,

23

knowing that that will be the consequence,

24

it were,

25

seriousness of the act.

he knows it's going to hurt the other person, he

that,

jacks up the moral reprehensibility, the

then, as

1

So in the weaker sense of malicious, willful

2

adds something, and I thought that was consistent with

3

Tinker.

Am I wrong?

4

MR. PRESSMAN:

Your Honor,

in terms of the

5

redundancy of the words, I believe it's difficult to come

6

up with an action which is malicious but not willful.

7

think it's easy to come up with an action that is willful

8

and not malicious.

I

An example of the second action would be if

9
10

someone came in here to harm one of the justices and

11

Marshall Bosley shot him.

12

not malicious.

13

His action would be willful but

He wasn't disregarding his duty.

On -- an example of something which is malicious

14

but not willful might be someone who came from a State

15

where carrying a firearm was perfectly okay, but he knew

16

in the City of Washington, D.C. that carrying one was

17

illegal.

18

here,

19

His action there I think is arguably not willful but it's

20

malicious.

22

23
24
25

He carries it through the airport, makes it

it drops out of his pocket,

He had a duty.

the bullet hits someone.

He disregarded his duty.

I think that's an example of something where you
use both of the words willful and malicious.
If the words willful and malicious both modify
injury, then I think they are redundant, because -QUESTION:

Excuse me.

made the choice to do the various procedures that he did

19

throughout this, his intent was never to injure, nor was

20

his choice governed by any intent to injure.

21

QUESTION:

Nor was the injury, as it were,

22

logically a necessity of whatever deficiency he may have

23

been guilty of.

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
But as you see the case, then,

malpractice actions in general as a category would not

MS. GRANDY:

No, Your Honor, not unless there

was some intent on the part of a doctor to injure and I

don't believe you find that in malpractice cases.

19

Well,

isn't that an element of the

crime of defama -- or the action of defamation itself?

You would have to have an intent to

defame someone?

I believe it is, Your Honor.
I mean -- or can you negligently

I don't know.

QUESTION:

I thought you had to say something

defamatory knowing of its falsity.

MS. GRANDY:

That's correct, Your Honor.
I don't think it's correct, only if

you're defaming a public figure.

Okay.

There are exceptions.

looked for its definition of intent to the Restatement

2

and,

3

is one where the actor desires or believes that the

4

results are going to occur and,

5

definition, the Court determined that Dr. Geiger did not

intend to harm the patient, therefore he had no willful

desire, or therefore there was no willful injury.

11

in doing that,

it determined that an intentional act

Having reached that point, the Eighth Circuit
concluded that section 523(a)(6) did not apply and
therefore the debt was dischargeable.
QUESTION:

Do you know what the practice is in

12

the States with respect to requiring, as a condition of

13

retaining a medical license, malpractice insurance?

14

MS. GRANDY:

No, I don't, Your Honor, but as a

15

policy reason,

16

Court's ruling would have some effect to cause doctors to

17

not carry malpractice insurance, they could govern that by

18

licensing it within their own States and requiring

19

insurance, just as in -- most States are now requiring, or

20

several States are requiring insurance in order to have a

21

driver's license.

22

if the State was concerned that this

Dr. Geiger, as found by the bankruptcy court,

23

had several reasons for his treatment.

He in prescribing

24

various types of medicine at all times 1) believed his

25

patient was getting better, 2)

thought he was -- she had

1

the ability to absorb medicine very well through her

2

stomach, which is why he made the various choices he made,

3

thought her infection had burned out, and thought she had

4

developed a superinfection in determining to stop using

5

antibiotics altogether.

6

So even if you were to take the definition of

7

malice as set forth in the Tinker case, Dr. Geiger would

8

have just cause or excuse for having done what he did.
The legislative history also supports this by

9
10

looking at the language to the extent other cases have

11

relied on Tinker to hold a reckless disregard standard.

12

There,

13

focusing on the intent of the injury itself, because a

14

reckless act would be one that would not require intent.

15

the courts once again are focus -- or Congress is

Within the section 500 of the Restatement is the

16

definition of recklessness and within that subsection (f)

17

of that definition there's a comparison of intentional

18

misconduct to recklessness and, when you compare the two,

19

recklessness does not require an intent.

20

feel reckless conduct, which the Eighth Circuit said at

21

the very worst his conduct was reckless,

22

dischargeable because there's -- you don't have the

23

element of intent in a reckless type of act.

25

That's why we

it would be

with the decision of the Eighth Circuit, because most of

the examples in Tinker appear to require an intent to

injure.

facts in certain situations and Tinker certainly does not

support a reckless disregard standard,

history is not overruling Tinker but basically saying,

The implied malice standard is limited to certain

7

The purposes and policy of the Bankruptcy Code

8

will be furthered by the decision of the Eighth Circuit.

9

This is because the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code overall

10

is to provide a debtor with a fresh start and that is why

11

exceptions to discharge are narrowly reviewed.

12

requiring an intent to cause an injury would lead to such

13

a narrow interpretation and enhance the fresh starts.

14

Intentional act,

The --

if you only require that which

15

results in injury, would lead to virtually everything

16

being nondischargeable, as pointed out by the Eighth

Circuit.

under that theory.

Once again, Justice Peckham's example of driving

into a crowded thoroughfare would be an intentional act

under that definition.

the decision of the Eighth Circuit was correct and

affirming that decision.
