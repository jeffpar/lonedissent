ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUANITA MADOLE

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. MADOLE:

10
11

Ms. Madole.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue presented here today is whether there

12

13

is a general maritime law survival cause of action for the

14

pre-death injuries to a nonseafarer when the conduct that

15

causes the injuries occurs on the high seas and whether,

16

if there is such a survival cause of action under general

17

maritime law, it may be brought independent of but

18

coexisting alongside the death action under the Death on

19

the High Seas Act.
In order to understand the argument, it is

20
21

important to point out the distinctions between the

22

survival cause of action and the wrongful death cause of

23

action.

24

survival cause of action traditionally encompassed --

25

encompasses the injuries that the individual he or herself

As this Court has stated several times, the

1

sustained prior to death from the time of the injury.
Those traditionally encompassed pre-death pain

2

3

and suffering, loss of earnings from the time of injury to

4

the time of death, and any medical or associated expenses

5

relating to the injuries until the time of death.
In the case that is before the Court today, the

6

7

petitioners only have a right to claim for pre-death

8

injuries, for pre-death pain and suffering, for the 12

9

minutes that their decedent suffered from the time the

10

aircraft upon which they were passengers were fired upon

11

until a 12-minute controlled descent into the Sea of Japan

12

and their ultimate deaths.

13

By comparison with survival actions --

14

QUESTION:

The case, of course, since it does

15

survive -- involve the survivor's action, could mean much

16

more than that.

17

people would linger for years with substantial injuries,

18

et cetera.

19

There would be other cases in which

MS. MADOLE:

That's correct, and respondent in

20

their response to the petition for certiorari also agreed

21

that the rule of the Court -- that this Court will lay

22

down will be applied whenever the conduct causes the

23

injuries and ultimately causes the death occurring on the

24

high seas.

25

In a more typical accident, they probably will

be more boat-based fact patterns, but the context in which

2

the case is before the Court is -- does arise out of an

3

airplane accident and does address only pre-death pain and

4

suffering and injuries.

5

P

By comparison with survival action injuries,

6

wrongful death remedies -- excuse me, survival action

7

remedies, by contrast wrongful death remedies, are losses

8

that the family members of the decedent themselves have

9

sustained, those losses that are individual to the family

10

members, are as a result of the death of the decedent and

11

are normally economically based.

12

Normally they are for loss of support, for loss

13

of economic support that the decedent would have provided

14
15

had the decedent continued to live, loss of services,

16

small children, loss of parental services to the small

17

children.

The beneficiaries are different.

cause of action the estate is the beneficiary, as the

20

holder of the individual injured person's claim after his

21

death.

22

In a wrongful death -QUESTION:

Ms. Madole, I think that the Court is

23

generally familiar with the difference between a wrongful

24

death act and a survival act, and getting down to the nub

25

of your problem, as I understand it the FELA originally

P

MS. MADOLE:

It left it to Congress

Why shouldn't we follow the

What occurred is, I believe,

6

Justice Ginsburg, is that the original FELA was patterned

7

after Lord Campbell's Act.

8

that the cause of action exist in the person at the time

9

of the death for there to be a right to recover for

Lord Campbell's Act required

10

survival and for death.

The FELA was amended in 1910 to

11

provide for both causes of action.

12

The Death on the High Seas Act, which is the

13

QUESTION:

But am I wrong in thinking that there

14

was an attempt, before that amendment, to get the courts

15

to recognize a survival claim for railroad workers?
MS. MADOLE:

16

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

17

Central Railway v. Vreeland the Court said you could not

18

have both a survival action and a wrongful death action

19

under the FELA, and that was then amended by Congress in

20

1910 .

21

But the basis for that was because the wrongful

22

death action under FELA was based upon a Lord Campbell's

23

Act type of statute which required the existence of a

24

cause of action in the decedent at the time of the death,

25

and if there had been recovery for survival there could

1

not also be a death recovery.

2

In this circumstance, the statute that we are

3

dealing with is the Death on the High Seas Act, and the

4

argument by respondent and the amicus is that the Death on

5

the High Seas Act precludes the court's traditional

6

development of a survival cause of action.
QUESTION:

7
8

And wasn't the Death on the High Seas

Act -- that wasn't modeled on Lord Campbell's Act?
MS. MADOLE:

9

It does not in that it did not

10

require the existence of the cause of action in the

11

decedent prior to death, so that there is no foreclosure

12

of a survival cause of action alongside a wrongful death

13

cause of action.
The only issue that the respondent and the

14
15

Government bring up with regard to the Death on the High

16

Seas Act is whether, by enacting the wrongful death

17

remedy, that the Congress intended to foreclose this

18

Court's traditional role in maritime actions to develop

19

law as policies change, so there's nothing in the Wrongful

20

Death Act under the Death on the High Seas Act itself that

21

would foreclose -QUESTION:

22

Well, do you consider it significant

23

that Congress was aware of survival provisions under the

24

Federal Employers Liability Act and it did not incorporate

25

them here?

I mean, that's a significant fact in the case,

2

is it not?
MS. MADOLE:

Well, it is to a limited degree,

3

Justice Kennedy, and that is that Congress decided it

4

wanted to provide a remedy from what it felt was the harsh

5

rule of The Harrisburg, that there was no common law right

6

to recover for wrongful death.

7

remedy in a limited area.

They wanted to provide the

8

The debates in the Congressional Record are a)

9

that the Congress wanted to have a remedy and b) how far

10

should that remedy go?

Should the remedy go only from the

11

3-miles limit from the shores of the United States, or

12

should Congress legislate into the territorial waters?

13

Congress decided just to legislate for death

14

action and just to legislate from the 3-mile limit

15

outwards, and just as this Court in Moragne said as long

16

as Congress did not speak to an area that was not within

17

its ambit, the Admiralty Court is free to develop in

18

accordance with its traditional capacity to effectuate the

19

policies of the common law as circumscribed for the

20

circumstances on the sea.

21

QUESTION:

Well, of course, Congress did, in 42

22

U.S. Code section 765, deal with death of a plaintiff and

23

what's recoverable, so to that extent Congress certainly

24

addressed the subject.

the statute of limitations began to run from the date of

the wrongful conduct, other than most typical wrongful

death statutes, where the statute of limitations begin --

6

begins to run from the date of the death.

7

765 should be put in the context of the statute as a
The Death on the High Seas Act was enacted so that

What Congress was attempting to do in section

8

765 was to say that if an injured person lived past the 2-

9

year statute, then the wrongful death right would be

10

abated to his or her beneficiaries because the 2 years had

11

run, because of the peculiarity of it beginning from the

12

date of the wrongful conduct instead of the wrongful

13

death.

14

The courts below in -- not in the case directly

15

in the court below, but other courts below that have

16

addressed these issues, and the commentators both at the

17

time and subsequently, have said that section 765 should

18

best be deemed a non-abatement section and not a survival

19

section, because what happened under section 9 -- or 765

20

was, the remedy was then turned into a wrongful death

21

remedy so that the heirs and the beneficiaries of the

22

decedent could recover wrongful death damages but nothing

23

was said in the statute about what happened to the injured

24

person's pre-death injuries, and that was not addressed.

1

death injuries which is why, if the Court elects to, it

2

has the capacity to develop general maritime law to

3

address pre-death injuries and the survival cause of

4

action.

5

QUESTION:

I guess it's hard for me to see that

6

Congress was entirely silent on what would happen to the

7

claims of pre-death injuries because in 765, if I'm

8

reading it rightly, it converts the pre-existing action

9

for pre-death injuries solely into the kind of death claim

10

that is allowed under the statute, and that sounds to me

11

as though it's saying, everything except the claim allowed

12

under this statute goes away.

13

MS. MADOLE:

And again, it has to be read in the

14

context of what it was attempting to achieve, and what

15

Congress was attempting to achieve was a rights-granting

16

statute.

wrongfulness of the conduct to the one that was injured.

But if that's all it wanted to do, I

would have thought that in 765 it would have said a

MS. MADOLE:

1

Well, it could be read that way,

2

Justice Souter, but I do not believe that if you look into

3

the historical background of what Congress is trying to

4

achieve, that that effectuates the remedial effects --

QUESTION:

But we deal with what Congress wrote,

not with what someone thinks Congress was trying to

8

language of 765 and you deduce what Congress intended from

9

the language of 765.
MS. MADOLE:

10
11

And again, from the legislative

history, it's very hard to decide that.
QUESTION:

I mean, I think you have to deal with the

18

is at Section 763a, which is the new statute of

19

limitations that was enacted in 1980.

20

earlier, the original section 763 provided for a 2-year

21

statute of limitations to begin as of the date of the

22

wrongful conduct.

In 1980, Congress repealed section 763 and

1

QUESTION:

Does that apply to causes of action

2

under than those -- other than those under the Death on

3

the High Seas Act?

4

causes of action, which might well explain that language?

5

Doesn't it cover Jones Act or other

MS. MADOLE:

It does cover causes of action

6

under general maritime law, under the Death on the High

7

Seas Act, and under the Jones Act, and it changed the

8

statute from one in which the statute began to, begin to

9

run from the date of the wrongful conduct until it begins

10

to run from the cause -- the date the cause of action

11

accrues, and it extended the statute to 3 years for all

12

three of those issues.

13

But if anything can be said from the language in

14

that, is that if Congress ever may have indicated in 1920

15

that it didn't recognize that both survival actions and

16

death actions or both can be brought together, at least by

17

1980 they were saying that they knew that there were two

18

kinds of actions and that one and the other could both be

19

brought concurrently with each other.

20

And it is not clear from the legislative history

21

of 7 -- section 763a the prompting mechanism for that, but

22

it's certainly clear that by that time the courts had

23

begun to develop along the lines of -- along the ken of --

24

the rationale of this Court in Moragne that there were

25

general maritime law of survival causes of action, based

1

upon the same rationale that The Harrisburg, whether or

2

not it was rightly decided when it had been decided

3

originally, the underpinnings of it had changed because

4

the policy had changed and the jurisprudence had changed,

5

and that there was a wholesale acceptance of wrongful

6

death causes of action in the United States.

7

Under the same analysis, many of the Federal

8

appellate courts had found that there was a general

9

maritime law of survival cause of action that, it was as a

10

result of the policy change and the jurisprudence in the

11

United States, because of the widespread adoption of

12

survival statutes amongst the States as well as on the

13

Federal level.

14

QUESTION:

Under the Jones Act, which picks up

15

on the FELA, there is both wrongful death relief and

16

survival that's rather circumscribed.

17

has done it all, both the FELA and, borrowing from the

18

FELA, the Jones Act, why should the Court say, well, it's

19

our job to fill in the Survival Act in this DOHSA, Death

20

on the High Seas Act legislation?

21

MS. MADOLE:

Given that Congress

The lower courts and many

22

commentators have said that the legislative history of the

23

Jones Act is not clear, and that the provision of a

24

survival cause of action in the Jones Act is solely

25

because of its wholesale incorporation of the FELA into

1

it.
We have to look at the statute that is arguably

2

3

by the respondent the one that precludes the court from

4

doing a general maritime law analysis to determine if the

5

policy is such that there should be a survival cause of

6

action and, under the Death on the High Seas Act, our

7

argument is there is no survival cause of action.

8

is no survival language in the statute, the statute itself

9

addresses only wrongful death remedies, and therefore

10

there is a void left that the court may fill with a

11

survival cause of action.
QUESTION:

12

There

But one can argue equally well, and I

13

think perhaps better, that Congress has addressed itself

14

to this question.

15

will be recoverable for death on the high seas, and there

16

isn't any void because what Congress has not granted, it

17

withheld.

It has decided what sort of damages

MS. MADOLE:

18

Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress

19

granted certainly was remedies for deaths on the high

20

seas.

21

on the high seas, and if you look to this Court's

22

traditional preemption and preclusion procedures, then

23

unless the congressional statute specifically preempts or

24

precludes the court from developing common law remedies,

25

then the court, particularly in its traditional role in

MS. MADOLE:

Then the closest case that is in

the context of the issue that we're here before is the

Moragne case, where the Court said that Congress had only

legislated as far outward as the 3-mile limit, and that

Yes, but --- in a Federal -Go ahead.

That is the same context in which we are arguing

16

that the Congress did not address the survival cause of

17

action in the Death on the High Seas Act, and since the

18

remedies are so different, and they don't overlap with

19

each other, then the Court has the capacity to develop the

20

common law survival cause of action for pre-death

remedies.

Well, when Congress enacted the

MS. MADOLE:

There are two responses, Justice

11

Scalia, to that inquiry.

The first is that if the person

significant expenses in the medical care, loss of

earnings, and has not had a chance to be compensated for

15

those injuries before his death, which he wouldn't be

because it's a survival action, all the debts are still

part of his estate that have to be paid from his heirs, if

he has any, with no compensation from the wrongdoer.

And the second part of that is that I

action could be superimposed on the Death on the High Seas

QUESTION:

Why isn't what you're doing -- the

bite of what you do is, it provides a somewhat different
class of beneficiaries when a person dies, and it provides
the whole of the beneficiaries with more money, so it

the damages are in respect to the harm caused when a
person dies.

that you used have to do with wrongful death remedies

that argument under 765, which is really a nonabatement

it doesn't change the cause of action into pre-death

regarding the pending legislation, back in 1996, in the

aviation cases from the Death on the High Seas Act.

However, there also was similar legislation

pending in the House of Representatives which would have

9

taken aviation cases but set forth the types of

recoverable damages.

Rather, what they would do is just allow nonpecuniary

QUESTION:

Under the present law, if a victim

lingers, say, for a year and has medical expenses and lost

wages, are those pecuniary losses recoverable when it

7

converts into a Death on the High Seas Act action, or into

a wrongful death action?
MR. HARAKAS:

If it converts into the Death on

the High Seas Act, generally lost wages would not be

recoverable.

those two elements of damages, you in effect get lost

wages and lost future earnings.

What you would recover are -- is loss of

With respect to medical expenses it's kind of an

16

interesting issue, because -- Justice Stevens said, why

hasn't this arisen before.

18

hasn't arisen before is that when you're dealing with

1

these DOHSA-type actions, mostly in a maritime context,

20

there are usually -- there is usually an element of that

21

in a settlement or even in a recovery, because medical

22

expenses can be viewed as a asset of the estate, so if a

23

decedent had $100,000 and $20,000 had to go to pay medical

expenses, well, you're depleting the loss of inheritance

of inheritance award.
I think if you look at Higginbotham,

2

in note 20

3

of Higginbotham they talked about burial expenses and

4

whether they're recoverable, and it makes a similar type

of analogy as to burial and funeral expenses.
QUESTION:

But for pain and suffering for the

there is no recovery.

There is no recovery, that's

correct.
QUESTION:

Now, what's the situation in

13

presumably doesn't govern?

14

MR. HARAKAS:

With respect to the territorial

15

waters the courts have taken two -- well, the courts have

16

basically taken two approaches.

17

Before the Calhoun decision some courts would

18

recognize a general maritime survival action applicable to

19

the territorial waters and allow recovery that way, but in

20

view of the Calhoun decision State statutes have always

21

been applicable and they would allow recovery under the

applicable State statute if it provided a survival statute

with respect to the territorial waters.

3

MR. HARAKAS:

Yes.

You would be able to recover

additional damages in territorial waters, but that's a

5

legislative scheme that exists even in the wrongful death

6

case.

7
8

Higginbotham dealt with that exact situation
with respect to loss of society damages, where the Supreme
Court, the Court in Gaudet had found that those type of

10

damages are recoverable under general maritime law, but

11

when it came to Higginbotham the Court said, you can't get

12

those under general maritime law in a DOHSA case, because

13

Congress has set forth what type of damages you can

14

recover and they've limited those damages to pecuniary

15

losses only.

16

And that's where we get to -- in this case here,

there isn't -- the real situation here is the issue of

Lord Campbell's Act, which didn't contain such a

common law doesn't arise in this situation, because the

Death on the High Seas Act deals with this issue.

3

QUESTION:

But one can argue that the analysis

4

in Moragne was partly based on when there's a hole in the

5

law on the high seas, and when the universal judgment of

6

State legislatures all over the country have changed from

7

what it used to be on the death act, that with regard to

8

survival, the same thing happened.

9

There used to be no survival at common law and

10

all of the State legislatures have now said there'll be

11

survival, and therefore if we wanted to be just as

12

creative as the Court was in Moragne, we would have

13

authority to do the same thing with regard to a survival

14

action, which is not squarely covered.
Arguably it's covered by that one section, by

It was a recognition of a cause

-- to make unseaworthiness a base

of liability uniform within the class.
In addition, again, as Your Honor recognized,

16

Moragne dealt with an issue in the territorial waters, so

17

the Court looked to, what has Congress enacted for

18

territorial waters, and they withheld the remedy of DOHSA

19

from extending into territorial waters, so there was a gap

20

that the Court could come in and fill.

21

But when you look to the decisions subsequent to

22

Moragne, Higginbotham, Miles, and Zicherman, we look --we

And to take the argument here that because

Congress then specifically say we're not going to allow

loss of survival damages, then any time Congress enacts,

they don't enact -- they don't legislate for the entire

MR. HARAKAS:

That's correct.

And the reason that Congress wouldn't

MR. HARAKAS:

Because they affirmatively set

Here, as in Mobil Oil v. Higginbotham, and as in

18

here, because it is clear from the text and the

The plight of an injured person who begins a

Now, Congress could have easily written

21

coordinated with the wrongful death --

22

QUESTION:

But those are all the same kind of

23

questions we get if the plaintiff doesn't die, if it's a

24

slip-and-fall case.

25

MR. MINEAR:

Not necessarily.

At least with

5?

1

regard to the coordination of the wrongful death remedy

2

with the survival remedy, there would still be a

3

requirement.

4

Here, if you're allowing both of those remedies,

5

this Court is going to have to make decisions in terms of

6

what remedies are compensable under each of those two

7

different causes of action, and where there might be an

8

overlap between the type of remedy that's provided --

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. MINEAR:

-- so there will be some, I

11

think -- some additional questions that would come up, and

12

some additional complications.

13

?

Yes.

Now, as I said, I think the legislative history

14

here makes it clear that Congress was making a conscious

15

choice.

16

hearings, indicate that Congress was aware of the

17

difference between a wrongful death action and a survival

18

action.

19

The legislative history, both the reports and the

Furthermore, Congress understood that the

20

statutory remedy here would be exclusive, and Congress was

21

also apparently aware of this Court's decision in Michigan

22

v. Vreeland, the case that Justice Ginsburg alluded to

23

earlier, in which the Court indicated that only Congress,

24

only a legislature could create a survival remedy and,

25

indeed, as has already been discussed, Congress has

created those types of survival remedies in the Jones Act

2

and also under the Federal Employers Liability Act.

3

But Congress nevertheless made a conscious

4

policy decision not to provide a survival remedy here,

5

and - QUESTION:

6

Was Congress aware -- at that time,

7

had Federal courts created new tort remedies in admiralty

8

law, or tort-like remedies on their own at all?
MR. MINEAR:

I think that this Court had

10

followed what was traditionally English practice, which

11

meant that there was an action for maintenance and cure

12

for seamen, and there was also an action for negligence,

13

general negligence for passengers --

14

QUESTION:

What I'm driving at is, would

15

Congress at that time also have been aware of the

16

possibility that Federal admiralty courts could create

17

remedies?

18

MR. MINEAR:

1

QUESTION:

20

MR. MINEAR:

No.

I think it probably --

No.
-- that would have caught it by

21

surprise, but that has changed now with Moragne.

22

Certainly this Court indicated a different view on that

23

matter.

24
25

But again, that was -- Moragne was in response
to the actions of State legislatures, and here I think

1

it's appropriate for this Court to defer to the actions of

2

Congress on this question.
As I said before, this is a legislative policy-

3
4

issue here, and Congress -QUESTION:

5

And can you enlighten -- give us any

6

more enlightenment than we've already had from counsel on

7

legislative policy?

8

what to do with air crashes?
MR. MINEAR:

What is the current thinking about

It's my understanding that the

10

House bill 2005 did pass the House, and that would have

11

simply removed aviation claims from the Death on the High

12

Seas Act.
QUESTION:

13
14

Left it all to State law, then, and

Moragne-type -MR. MINEAR:

15

Yes.

We'd then be faced with a

16

choice-of-law question that was relatively easy after

17

Zicherman, where this Court simply looked to the question

18

of Death on the High Seas Act, that we'd then be faced, in

1

Warsaw cases, of determining what is the appropriate body

20

of law.

21

foreign cause of action.

22

Most likely it would be a State, or perhaps a

There is action pending in the Senate, but I

23

don't believe that anything has passed the Senate at this

24

point, and I believe the provisions are different from the

25

House bill.

1

Now, as I've said, I think that the Court cannot

take action in this case in providing a survival remedy

without overruling, or at least overriding the judgment

that Congress made in 1920.

believe, that is for Congress.
