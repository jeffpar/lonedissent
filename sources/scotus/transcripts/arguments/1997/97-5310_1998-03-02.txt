CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S. ROGOW

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ROGOW:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Ocwen Bank agrees that there is a right of

12

rescission in recoupment after 3 years.

13

says that that right in recoupment is a State safety net,

14

that one can rescind in recoupment only if there is fraud

15

or duress or coercion under State law principles.

16

QUESTION:

Ocwen, however,

Is right of rescission in recoupment,

17

is that a term peculiar to Florida law, or is that how we

18

speak of it generally?

19

as simply being offset to damages, but rescission is an

20

action of an equitable nature.

21
22

23

I always thought it -- recoupment

I don't -- and your brief talks in the same way.
You seem to conflate the two terms.
MR. ROGOW:

Justice Kennedy, rescission in this

24

situation is statutory rescission, and I think it's

25

important to note, too, that the right to rescind within

3 years is not an action in rescission under the truth-

2

in-lending law.

3

rescission within the 3 years.

4

QUESTION:

It is merely sending a notice of

Well, can't we say that without

5

coupling it with the term of recoupment, or does that

6

somehow help your case to talk about recoupment?

7

MR. ROGOW:

It helps our case to talk about

8

recoupment and, indeed, 1635(i)(3) talks about rescission

9

in recoupment, a statute that the supreme court of Florida

10

absolutely ignored in this analysis.
QUESTION:

11
12

The statute itself talks about

rescission in recoupment?
MR. ROGOW:

13

Under State law, but the caption of

14

(i)(3) is the right to recoupment under State law, and

15

then the statute says, nothing in this section shall

16

affect the right to rescission in recoupment under State

17

law.

18

Ocwen suggests that that only means State law

19

rescission for fraud, duress, or coercion, and our

20

position is, is it means more than that.

21

Federal Truth-in-Lending Act right to rescission, and

22

several reasons support our position.

23

It means the

The first is the notion that, when one looks at

24

this statute, the word rescission used throughout the

25

statute is Federal TILA rescission, and this Court's

decision last week in National Credit Union reasserted a

2

principle that, when one looks at statutes and the same

3

words are used throughout the statute, then the word has

4

the same meaning,

5

throughout section 1635 and it is referring to TILA

rescission, Truth-in-Lending Act rescission,

MR. ROGOW:

2

QUESTION:

That is available.

'S.

But your client asserts in addition a

right to rescind and recover all of the interest paid for

wouldn't it --

MR. ROGOW:

QUESTION:

19

MR. ROGOW:

No, it would not --- under your theory?
It wouldn't be enough, Justice

20

O'Connor, because under Congress' construct it would have

21

to be more, but I think the answer to this is -- because I

22

understand --

Congress has said that is right, because the remedy -QUESTION:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, because

I'm not a bit sure that's what they said, but

That is our position, Justice

10

O'Connor, but we think it's informed by how one construes

MR. ROGOW:

You do have to tender back

And your client is here in forma

Yes.
Does he have the money to do that?
Well, at this moment, of course, he

23

doesn't have the money to do that and what happens in

24

these cases generally is, is that if the right to

rescission is invoked, then the borrower is entitled to

the return of the interest, but the borrower has to pay

the principal back.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ROGOW:

Right.
And in some situations, indeed, if

5

one's house has appreciated in value, you can then

6

refinance your house and pay back the principal.

7

But I think the important thing here, Justice

8

Stevens, is is that whatever the remedy is, is a remedy

9

that Congress has constructed not as a penalty to the

10

lender, but to force the lender to conform to the truth-

11

in-lending law.

12

to protect consumers.

The truth-in-lending law, its purpose is

QUESTION:

13

Mr. Rogow, you are so stressing the

14

word rescission -- you say that's used over repeatedly,

15

and yet Congress used such distinctly different language

16

in dealing with the 1-year time limit for damages.

17

says no action should be brought, traditional statute of

18

limitations.

The other, it sounds like expire, dead, over,

25

explain that Congress picked this word expire to describe

the right of rescission, and then talking about the 1-

2

year limitation, used traditional statute of limitations

language?

4

MR. ROGOW:

Two ways, Justice Ginsburg.

The

first is the right that expires is the right to

affirmatively rescind.

7

about is the right within 3 years to say to the lender,

8

am rescinding this transaction.

9

QUESTION:

10

That right that they're talking
I

That is the right that

Well, you say so, but what is there

11

in the statute that indicates that, and anything that

12

indicates that it's only -- the same thing -- what you're

13

saying is, it is the same thing as the extension of the

14

statute of limitations, which doesn't count if you're

15

seeking only to recoup.

16

MR. ROGOW:

Justice Ginsburg,

(i)(3) says the

17

right to rescission in recoupment shall not be affected

18

and is available under State law, so even if one looks at

19

1635(f), the shall expire language, that is revived by

20

(i) (3) .

21
22

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Rogow, can I ask you about that?

Do you want us to determine what Florida law says?
I mean, let's assume we agree with you as to the

24

meaning of (i)(3), should we determine that there is such

25

a right of rescission in recoupment under Florida law?

1

rescission is strictly a State law right of rescission,

and when one reads a supreme court of Florida opinion, it

is driven by its view that Congress has said that there

shall be no right of rescission under Federal law.

the heart of our argument, that was a mistake.

QUESTION:

I understand that.

That's

They say that

under Federal law there can be no State law of -- right of

think this is the kind of matter on which there should be

recoupment?

MR. ROGOW:

Not if they applied neutral

principles of Florida law, because Florida law permits

rescission in recoupment, okay.

QUESTION:

May I clarify one thing, Mr. Rogow,

8

because I think we lost a piece of this that's essential.

9

I think -- you said at the very beginning that the bank

10

agrees there is a right to rescission in recoupment,

11

whatever you --

12

MR. ROGOW:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.
But solely under State law.

That is,

14

as Justice Scalia asked the question, the -- there is a

15

concession, whatever, that whatever Florida law would be

16

apart from TILA, TILA doesn't exist, if there's a right to

17

rescission under State law that would apply here, but I

18

think you're urging the double -- the two things.

19

is, you must get TILA into it, otherwise there's no

20

difference in your position.

21

MR. ROGOW:

That is exactly right.

That

Our position

22

is, is that 1635(i)(3) embraces TILA rescission and State

You've got -- you say that under TILA in 3 years

or 10 years, it doesn't matter, you can rescind if you're

sued.

5

Now, what extra does this add?

If you have your

right under Federal law, then what does the addition of

7

the State law --

8

9

MR. ROGOW:

It makes it clear that Federal law

is not preempting the field, but rescission in recoupment

10

under State law would also be available for fraud, duress,

11

or coercion.

12

QUESTION:

It's not a matter of preemption.

13

It's a matter of ultimate source.

14

that the obligation to make these disclosures and to make

15

these calculations correctly arises under Federal law.

16

MR. ROGOW:

17

QUESTION:

You're saying, I think,

It does, Justice Kennedy.
And it's for that Federal law

18

Congress has provided a remedy for breach, rescission,

19

but it says it can only be for 3 years.

21

MR. ROGOW:
■QUESTION:

It says it can only be - So it seems to me, as Justice

22

Ginsburg is indicating, you're trying to have it both

23

ways, but that's quite different from saying that there is

24

simply a State law cause of action.

Kennedy, is -- and the supreme court of Florida came to

2

the conclusion that there is no Federal right to

3

rescission after 3 years.

4

then their decision is not properly informed, and that's

5

what we're arguing, that they are wrong about that.

6

QUESTION:

If they are wrong about that,

But certainly section -- subsection,

7

or double subsection (3) of 1635(i), which says nothing in

8

this subsection affects a consumer's right of rescission

in recoupment -- that does not give any Federal right.

MR. ROGOW:

It leaves open the door to the

Federal right.
QUESTION:

It leaves -- well, it leaves open the

possibility that the State may give you a right.
MR. ROGOW:

It certainly leaves open the State

15

giving you a right, but it does not preclude, and I think

16

that's the key to this case, is it does not preclude the

17

use of the Federal right.

18

QUESTION:

No, but it seems to me that your

19

Federal right of rescission goes when it says an obligor's

consummation.

MR. ROGOW:

By -It doesn't say affirmatively rescind.
When one reads 1635(a) and 1635(b)

7

in that section, they're talking about sending a notice of

rescission within 3 years, affirmatively rescinding.

are talking about rescinding in recoupment, something that

And that's a State law right.

MR. ROGOW:

1

It was not, and at the time (i)(3)

was not in existence when the petitioner filed his -- his

3

and her affirmative defenses, so they were relying upon

4

the right to rescission, which every court that had

5

addressed this since 1 84 found that there was a right to

6

rescission in recoupment after 3 years.

7

QUESTION:

Why is --

8

QUESTION:

May I -- no, please.

May I go back, though, to an earlier question.
10

Leaving aside the fact that the word affirmative does not

11

appear in 1635(f), how do you explain the distinction

12

between the shall-not-be-brought language with respect to

13

the damages remedy, which sounds like a normal statute of

14

limitations, and the shall-expire language with respect to

15

this rescission right?

16
17

What is the reason, in effect, that I think
you're telling us we should ignore that distinction?

18

MR. ROGOW:

No.

The cases, Bull, Reiter,

1

Western Pacific, clearly make it plain that Congress --

20

only the clearest congressional language would prevent a

21

statute of limitations from being used in recoupment, and

22

the language here, shall expire, is being read now as

23

something other than a statute of limitations.

24

think the nomenclature makes any difference in this

25

situation.

QUESTION:

1

Well, but ray question is, why

2

shouldn't it make some difference?

3

not be brought is standard limitation language.

4

expire is not, and on its face it suggests that in fact a

5

distinction is being made, and I don't know why we should

6

ignore that distinction in language and find it of no

7

significance, and I don't think you've answered that.
MR. ROGOW:

8

9

The shall -- the shall
Shall

I think, Justice Souter, that the

answer lies in (i)(3), that if one views, as is right, as

10

having expired, then (i)(3) revived it by its language

11

that leaves open the notion that there can be rescission

12

in recoupment.

13

QUESTION:

Well,

(i)(3) doesn't have to be read

14

that way.

15

permissions that do not rely upon this Federal statute?

16

Cannot (i)(3) refer to State law recoupment

That is to say, if the same failure to provide

17

information under this Federal statute also constitutes a

18

fraud under State law, this provision can be read to say,

19

recoupment and rescission for that fraud is not affected

20

by our 3-dyear termination of the rescission for violation

21

of this act.

MR. ROGOW:

No, it need not only be read that

4

indication that Justice Souter was just referring to, the

indication that they use language different from the

7

I'm saying, when you put that together with the

MR. ROGOW:

But the supreme court of Florida

8

said it can only be read one way, and that, we think, is

9

their error.

It can be read -- unless there's clear

10

language that says there is no rescission in recoupment

11

under Reiter, Bull, and Western Pacific, then the Court

should conclude that --

affect the right to rescission in recoupment under State

law, so while that -- your reading would be the usual

reading, the fact that (i)(3) is added to this changes

this from being that kind of statute of repose where the

right has expired, died as often is suggested, into

something that now has been revived.

7

QUESTION:

No, but your argument, as I

8

understand it, is that the reason (i) revives it is that

9

(i), in effect -- or State law looks to -- would look to

10

Federal law, and specifically this act, but when

11

Federal -- when State law does look to Federal law under

12

this act, what it sees is what Justice Ginsburg just

13

described.

14

It sees language that seems to say, with respect

15

to the 1635 right, it expires, so whether (i) is there or

16

whether (i) isn't there, you've got to deal with the

17

expire language and I do not see that the formulaic

incorpora -- or reservation of State law has any bearing

one way or the other on the significance of that

First, Justice Breyer, in response to your

problems that arise in the bankruptcy setting and the fact

that there are lots of lenders who end up not being able

to recover anywhere near the full amount of the

outstanding loan in the rescission context, so that's some

evidence of --

QUESTION:

Why would that be?

I mean, that's --

11

I'm trying to figure out legally why would that be?

If,

in order to rescind, the homeowner has to tender back the

principal of the loan, why would the bank not get the

That's what was confusing me.

Again, I think all they wanted to make clear of
was that State law would be protected.

QUESTION:

But is there such an animal in State

law as rescission in recoupment?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

There is a reference to that

6

language in one of the -- actually, one of the earlier

7

Florida cases, where -- it's not actually that language,

8

but there is recoupment action, and they do talk about

9

rescission, but you know, our footnote 6 in our brief goes

10

to great lengths -- we looked in vain for this to try to

11

figure out where Congress came up with this particular

12

animal and frankly couldn't find it.

QUESTION:

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

And what's the answer to that?
Well, I still think that Congress

3

would have meant for State law to apply to both, so it

4

wouldn't have made a difference.

5

QUESTION:

But Mr. Phillips, as I understand

6

your position, you're just saying there's no Federal right

7

here, but I don't think you take the position that if

8

Florida said we're going to treat even a trivial violation

9

of TILA as a ground for State law rescission, you aren't

10

saying that it would be preempted -MR. PHILLIPS:

11

No, I'm not arguing it would be

12

preempted, but I do think it's important in that regard, a

13

la Justice Scalia's question about a remand in this case,

14

is that the first half of the Florida supreme court's

15

opinion analyzes the Federal statutory issue.

16

The second half of it analyzes it as a matter of

17

State recoupment law and conclusively says that in our

18

judgment this kind of a statute is not the kind of a

19

statute in which we would exercise recoupment and

20

therefore, as a matter of State law, there's no basis for

21

recovery.

22

That's over and above the fact that they've

23

never asked for recovery under State law at any time.

Well, that's the other point I was

going to ask is, when did their claim for a State law

QUESTION:

But you think that nonetheless, as

you read the opinion of the Florida supreme court, it

Absolutely.

Absolutely, because

QUESTION:

Even though it wasn't requested.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor,

20

because the question that was certified to the Florida

21

supreme court was whether or not there was this kind of a

22

right under State law, and if you look at the joint

23

appendix on 164 to 165, the last line of 164 says, after

24

analyzing all of the traditional grounds for statutory

interpretation as to why this provision doesn't grant a

Federal right it says, but that does not end our inquiry,

2

and then it turns, in Florida, and I take the rest of that

analysis really --

4

QUESTION:

And you don't think that the Florida

court thought that it was simply not at liberty to confer

some State law right of rescission on the theory that TILA

7

had preempted State law.
MR. PHILLIPS:

8

9
10

I don't see anything in the

Court's opinion that remotely suggested that to be the
case, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

11

Well, the question presented here is,

12

may an action for the statutory right of rescission

13

provided by TILA be revived as a defense in recoupment

14

beyond the 3-year limit on the right of rescission set

15

forth in section 13 -- 1635(f).

16

I'm not sure that even includes that question.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- no question about it,

Mr. Chief Justice, it doesn't include that question,

joint appendix.

3

The courts that have looked at this -- Dawes,

4

Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Illinois --

5

have all decided that there is a right to rescission in

6

recoupment consistent with the Federal TILA right that

7

could be asserted affirmatively within the first 3 years.

8

This Court has talked generally about

recoupment.

It is an equitable remedy.

There is nothing

inequitable here.
