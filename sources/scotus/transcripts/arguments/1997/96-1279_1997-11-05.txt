CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

5

States.

Mr. Rubinstein.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAVIER H. RUBINSTEIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The question before the Court in this case is

12

whether the removal of an element by the trial court of an

13

essential element of the crime with which a defendant is

14

charged from the jury's consideration is the type of error

15

that can be subject to harmless error scrutiny even if the

16

defendant admitted the element by his testimony.

17

this Court to hold that it is not.

18

We urge

In this case, it is undisputed that the trial

19

court completely removed from the jury's consideration an

20

element of the offenses with which petitioner was charged.

21

Although the court of appeals recognized that there was an

22

incomplete verdict, it nonetheless held that the error was

23

subject to harmless error scrutiny because the trial court

24

removed only one element of the offense.

25

QUESTION:

Well, when you say an incomplete

1

verdict, you don't mean that the verdict formed was

2

incomplete, do you?

3

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

What we mean is that the

4

jury -- what the jury found, the elements that the jury

5

found do not constitute a crime, that the jury did not

6

render a verdict on every element.

7

QUESTION:

Let's take a look and -- are you

8

saying that the form of the jury verdict didn't comply

9

with law?
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

10
11

Well, in the sense that every

element of the offense charged was not included.
QUESTION:

12

Well, but that isn't in the form of a

13

jury -- that isn't in an ordinary jury verdict, that they

14

find every element of the offense, is it?

15

find a person guilty or not guilty.

16

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

They simply

That is true.

And that was done here, was it not?
Yes, except that it was done in

19

the context of jury instructions that did not instruct the

20

jury --

21

QUESTION:

Well, yes, but that's a little

22

different than saying the jury rendered a flawed verdict

23

in the sense of some defect in the form of the verdict.

24
25

MR. RUBINSTEIN:
respect to the actual form.

Our contention is not with
It is with respect to the

1

fact that, as this Court held in Gaudin, a verdict of

2

guilty necessarily means a verdict that the defendant is

3

guilty of every element of the crime with which he is

4

charged, and in this case it is undisputed that the -- one

5

of the elements of that crime was explicitly removed by

6

the trial court from the jury's consideration.

7

It is in that respect, and as this Court

8

explained in Gaudin, without an element -- without a jury

9

finding on each element of the crime with which the

10

defendant is charged, there is no verdict within the

11

meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and if there is no verdict

12

within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, as this Court

13

held in Sullivan there is no object upon which the

14

harmless error doctrine --

15
16

QUESTION:

In Sullivan the failure wasn't to

give an instruction about reasonable doubt, was it not?

17

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Yes, it was.

And there, one could say that the

jury had not found anything the way it should have.
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Actually, in our view the error

21

in this case provides an even clearer example of the type

22

of error that cannot be subject to harmless error scrutiny

23

than was present in Sullivan.

24
25

As The Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out in
his concurring opinion in Sullivan, at least in that case

1

the jury, there could be room for some argument as to

2

whether or not the defective reasonable doubt instruction

3

impacted the jury's deliberations, whereas -- and in the

4

concurring opinion, Your Honor drew a distinction with the

5

case in which an element is explicitly removed.

6

In the case of an element that is taken away

7

from the jury, there is no room for speculation, because

8

it is clear that the jury did not, in fact, render a

9

complete verdict within the meaning of the Constitution.

10

QUESTION:

Well, I have trouble with your

11

present articulation of the question, too.

You seem to be

12

shoe-horning it into an incomplete verdict argument, but I

3

thought the question presented related to the failure of

4

the court to give an instruction, and all of a sudden

5

we're hearing some new articulation.

6

you're doing that.

7

case or something?

Is it to try to get it into some other

8

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

9

QUESTION:

No, no.

What happened here was, there isn't

20

an instruction on one element.

21

That he knew it was a silencer?

22

23
24
25

I don't know why

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Yes.

Now, what is that element?

It is the element of mens

rea that this Court required in Staples v. United States.
QUESTION:

And what's the specific crime that

we're talking about here, the possession of a silencer?

1

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Of an unregistered silencer.

Uh-huh.
And in particular, what Staples

4

would require in combination with the knowing possession

5

requirement is that the defendant must knowingly possess

6

an object, and at the time that the defendant knowingly

7

possesses it --

8

9
10

QUESTION:

And you say that that can never be a

harmless error, the failure to instruct?
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

If the trial court fails to

11

instruct the jury on an element of the crime, and the

12

jury's findings on the other elements do not necessarily

13

encompass the element that was omitted --

14

QUESTION:

Well, what if it's clear from the

15

evidence that the defendant says, yeah, I had a silencer.

16

I knew it was a silencer.

17

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

In that particular --

Harmless error possible?
It would depend.

In light of

20

this Court's decision earlier this year in Johnson v.

21

United States, there would have to be a timely objection

22

to the instruction.

23

In other words, the instructional error would

24

have to be preserved for appellate review in order for the

25

harmless error doctrine to even be potentially applicable,

1

otherwise the plain error doctrine would apply and, as

2

this Court held in Johnson, under those circumstances the

3

analysis would be quite different, so in our --

4

QUESTION:

Well, the plain error doctrine as

5

enunciated in Olano refers back to the Atkinson case and

6

says you don't reverse if the reversal would seriously --

7

unless it would seriously affect the fairness and

8

integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

9

How do you think a reversal here would affect the public

10

perception of judicial proceedings where your client

11

admitted the element that you say is missing?

12

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

I --

You know, that's what harmless

error's all about, is technical things like that.
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

I would like to answer your

16

question, Mr. Chief Justice, in two ways.

17

presented a circumstance in which there was no objection

18

and so therefore, as this Court held in Johnson, the

19

constitutional objection is forfeit.

20

analysis is entirely governed by Rule 52.

21

First, Olano

In other words, the

And as far as the second part of your question,

22

though, as far as the public perception, the reason why

23

reversal is required when an element is omitted from the

24

trial court's instructions and where there is a

25

contemporaneous objection to the instructional error is

1

because it is the right to the jury trial itself that is

2

at stake.

3

When the -- and in addition to that, what is

4

also at stake when a trial court removes an element of the

5

offense charged, as occurred in this case, effectively

6

what is happening is that the trial court is directing a

7

verdict in favor of the State as to that element.

8

taking the element away from the jury.

9

It is

And when the appellate court, as occurred in

10

this case, is faced with the removal of an element, and

11

decides that to look at the evidence and make its own

12

finding as to whether the element was established beyond a

13

reasonable doubt.

14

Sullivan, is that the wrong entity is judging the

15

defendant guilty.

16

QUESTION:

The problem, as this Court explained in

Your rule would carry over to the

17

States, too, I suppose, so that any failure on the part of

18

a State court to charge on some element of a crime would

19

be Federal constitutional error.

20
21
22

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

If the jury does not find the

element that was omitted -QUESTION:

Well, ordinarily juries don't find

23

special verdicts.

24

back to the question of what a -- what was charged.

25

They find general verdicts.

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

So it goes

It is certainly true that a

1

jury generally will enter a general verdict, but it is a

2

general verdict that is predicated upon the jury's

3

instructions that tell the jury what the elements are.

4

QUESTION:

So what is your answer to my

5

question?

6

element in all State cases?

7

Would this affect all failures to charge on an

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

It would affect State cases,

8

but it would only do so if the jury does not find that

9

element.
QUESTION:

10

Well, you're not answering my

11

question.

12

charge, the failure of a judge to charge on an element of

3

My question is, would this affect failures to

the crime in all State cases?

4

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

It would not.

It would only

5

apply where the failure is a complete one, where the

6

jury's findings on other elements do not embrace the

7

element that was omitted, and where there is a

8

contemporaneous --

9
20

QUESTION:

Mr. Rubinstein, you're not making any

distinction between Federal trials and State trials.

21

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

22

QUESTION:

I'm not.

So whatever the rule is for the

23

Federal trials you're saying, whatever you're arguing here

24

in the Federal trial would apply to the State trial as

25

well.

1

You mentioned that this is an example of a type

2

of error that is incurable, and the standard categories,

3

the person who is without counsel, the biased judge, and

4

now you say the failure to instruct on an element when

5

there's a request for the instruction.

6

in that category of incurable errors?

7
8

9
10

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

What else belongs

In addition to the type of

error that we are dealing with in this case?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Essentially it would be a

11

situation where the right to the jury trial itself has

12

been denied.

13

QUESTION:

Yes, well, if you could be specific

14

about that, and I gave the two standard ones and added the

15

one you're urging.

16

Is there anything else, or is that it?

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

As far as I am -- I am only

17

prepared in this case to suggest that -- and I realize

18

that the category of errors that this Court has regarded

19

as essentially being immune from harmless error scrutiny

20

are limited, and we accept that.

21

QUESTION:

May I ask you -- you're saying where

22

the essence of the right to a jury trial is denied and, of

23

course, the principal purpose of the jury is to resolve

24

disputed issues of fact, and is it equally important to

25

have the jury pass on an undisputed issue of fact, where

1

everybody agrees what the facts are?

2

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Yes, it is.

And why?
And the reason is that as this

5

Court indicated, for instance, in Estelle v. McGuire,

6

where a defendant concedes an element, the prosecution's

7

burden of proof remains the same, and where a defendant

8

admits an element through testimony the weight of that

9

testimony is for the jury to decide.

10

QUESTION:

Ultimately, what --

Yes, but it's not merely an admission

11

which, sometimes admissions are more probative than

12

others, but it's also the -- as counsel agreed that the

3

facts -- as I remember the record here, that the facts are

4

that he in fact knew that it was a silencer.

5

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Yes.

Ultimately, as this Court

6

explained in Duncan, the purpose of the jury trial and the

7

purpose -- is to ultimately have the jury pass upon the

8

guilt or innocence of the defendant.

9

QUESTION:

I take it that interstate commerce,

20

which is a jurisdictional requisite to many Federal

21

crimes, and I think can be called an element of the

22

offense, has to be charged and considered by the jury in

23

every case, even though it was obvious that interstate

24

commerce is involved.

25

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

I would say the answer is yes,
12

1

assuming that the defendant objects to -- assuming that

2

there is a failure to instruct on the interstate commerce

3

element, it would only be subject to the rule that we are

4

talking about if the defendant timely objects to the trial

5

court's failure to instruct on that element, and --

6

QUESTION:

And defenses, the same thing?

7

Defenses to the mens rea that's necessary for a crime,

8

those are also included in your rule?

9

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

I would think so.

To give an

10

example of entrapment, the burden of production that would

11

be necessary on the part of the defendant to trigger the

12

defendant's entitlement to a defense instruction like

13

entrapment would be subject to appellate review.

14

But if an appellate court concludes that the

15

burden of production was satisfied and that the defendant

16

did have a right to have the instruction given to the

17

jury, it would not be within the power of the appellate

18

court to declare the omission of that instruction harmless

19

because the appellate court has reviewed the evidence and

20

decided that, in fact, no reasonable jury would have found

21

that entrapment existed.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Rubinstein, what if the defendant

23

at his arraignment said -- the judge said, well, how do

24

you plead, and he said, I plead not guilty, except that I

25

perfectly well knew that this object that they're talking

1

about was a silencer.

2

trial on that element then?

3

Would he have the right to a jury-

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

That apparently is an open

4

question within the circuits, and I know that there is --

5

it is a conflict right now as to whether or not a

6

defendant can partially plead guilty.

7

QUESTION:

Well, the -- I mean, I guess it's

8

obvious the theory is that the trial is held to resolve

9

issues which are joined, and that issue is not joined in

10

the hypothesis that I give, so I would suppose there was a

11

pretty good argument there for the propriety of removing

12

that from the jury's consideration.

13

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

If it were permissible to plead

14

to an element in accordance with Rule 11, and all of the

15

normal safeguards are provided to the defendant, that the

16

defendant is waiving his or her right to a jury trial as

17

to that element, and if such a plea were permissible, I

18

think that since we are talking about it --

19

QUESTION:

Then the same thing would be true

20

here, I suppose, if he stands up at a later point and

21

says, look, I know about that.

22

question about that element.

23

That -- there's no

And I take it what your argument would boil down

24

to then would be that the failure here is the failure to

25

conduct a kind of waiver hearing.

In other words, if the

1

judge had said, now, wait a minute, you can admit that if

2

you want to, and we'll take it away from the jury if you

3

understand that you are waiving your jury trial right and

4

there's a burden of proof and so on, the kind of Boykin

5

thing.

6

So I take it you would say that if they'd gone

7

through a Boykin analysis on this element it would be

8

perfectly permissible to take it from the jury.

9

true?

10

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Is that

Let me answer that in two ways.

11

First of all, this Court has said that even where an open

12

concession is made on an element, that that does not

13

reduce the prosecution's burden of proof.

14

where a defendant stipulates --

15

QUESTION:

In fact, even

I was surprised to hear you concede

16

the point that a -- that Justice Souter began with that a

17

trial is held, in criminal cases at least, only to resolve

18

those issues that are joined.

19

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

20

QUESTION:

I --

I mean, suppose the defendant comes

21

in and says, I am pleading not guilty, Your Honor, but of

22

course I committed the crime, does that mean you don't

23

need a trial?

24
25

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Absolutely not, and I did not

mean to concede -15

3

QUESTION:

You still need a trial.

You need a

jury -- a jury verdict that he committed it.
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Absolutely, and it is our

4

position that if the defendant pleads not guilty, it makes

5

no difference whether the defendant concedes an element.

6

It would make no difference if the defendant openly

7

confessed on the stand that he or she committed the crime.

8

9

The Government concedes in its brief that if a
defendant were to break down on the stand and openly

10

concede guilt of the crime it would not be harmless for

11

the judge to discharge the jury and enter a judgment of

12

conviction.

13

QUESTION:

Suppose there are two counts, as

14

there were in this case, submitted to the jury and under

15

the law each count requires knowing that it's a silencer,

16

but as to count 1 the judge instructs that that's not an

17

issue, and as to count 2 -- but then he's convicted on

18

both counts.

19

on both counts?

20

Can you go back and sustain the conviction

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

It would depend -- if the jury

21

could not have found the elements of -- on one count

22

without also finding --

23

QUESTION:

Well, they --

24

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Let me rephrase that.

Suppose they found there was a

silencer on one count which was rather minor so far as the

2

sentence is concerned, but then as to the major count the

3

judge instructs knowledge is not -- this is not for you to

4

consider, what result there?

5

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

In that case the jury will have

haven't had this dynamic of facing the whole crime, which

11

you describe in your reply brief.

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

In that context, and I think

13

that this Court's decision in Pope is instructive on that,

that if the jury could not -- if the jury actually did

make the finding of fact that would be necessary to

establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt --

No, but that's on the same count.

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Right.

See, Pope, it was all one count.
Yes, I understand that, but if

23

no rational jury could have found what they did find as to

count 2 and not find it at the same time as to count 1 --

In other words, that's ambiguous, but it's

certainly able -- and my natural reading is, defendant,

12

you don't have to know that that thing, which you do know

13

is the very thing described in section 5845, you do not

have to know the fact that there's a statute called 5845

Let me answer your question,

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

First, with respect to the

What they conceded was that it

was removed.
QUESTION:

10

Fine, and I say, you can say that if

11

you're prepared to say that the reason it was removed is

12

because the instruction was capable of two possible

13

understandings.
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

14

I would take issue that it is

ambiguous.

In my reading of the instruction the trial

did not have to prove that the defendant knew the

QUESTION:

Which the law requires to be

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

And when the defendant's

counsel objected, he objected on the grounds that it was

necessary for the Government to prove, otherwise the

7

counsel was concerned that the element, without that

8

element, that a jury might be inclined to believe, as this

9

Court was concerned in Staples, that simply knowing

10
11

possession of the object itself was enough to convict.
Ultimately -- and the court of appeals also held

12

that the element was explicitly removed and ultimately,

13

with respect to the question of whether every conviction

14

involving an ambiguous instruction would be subject to

15

reversal, ultimately it will be for the Court to decide

16

whether or not, based on the review of the instructions

17

themselves, whether the element in fact was omitted or not

18

would be incumbent upon defense counsel to object on the

grounds that --

whether the defendant knew there's a statute that makes it

As you read it, you thought it meant something

different, namely that the element's missing, and what

worries me is if the Constitution of the United States

says in respect to that kind of instruction it can never

QUESTION:

Mr. Rubinstein, the question

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Still, if that -- I mean, I'd worry

about lawyers reading an opinion that upheld you in light

of the instruction that was actually given, and even if

4

that weren't so,

could never be harmless error.
That's -- why would the Constitution say that?

I'm still worried about my basic problem,

That's
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

And it is not our contention

11

that it would never be harmless error.

12

where the omission is a true one, and where the jury's

13

findings on other elements do not necessarily embrace the

14

omitted element and, finally, where there is a

contemporaneous objection and where it is brought to the

opportunity to consider whether the element has been

omitted or not.

whether a defendant is entitled to an appellate remedy if

2

the district court erroneously failed to instruct the jury

3

on an element that the defendant admitted in open court.

4

In this case, the question is, at bottom,

5

whether petitioner is entitled to reversal on the ground

6

that the jury was deprived of an opportunity to find that

7

he was not telling the truth when he testified under oath

8

that he knew that a silencer was a silencer.

And you might add in there that he

asked for the instruction to be given and it was denied.

11

He did object to its not being given.

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

13

QUESTION:

Okay.

He did.
And the issue is, you say he's

entitled to have them all given, and even when he objects

when one is not given, the issue is whether it makes any

Sullivan

In Sullivan, it was held to be categorically

reversible if there is no -- if there's no finding beyond

contrast, in the cases where this Court has addressed

13

burden of proof errors that relate only to individual

elements, it has held that harmless error analysis is

applicable.

16

QUESTION:

Sullivan differs from this case in

17

that there was a jury finding of the element.

18

question is whether the jury finding was tainted by the

19

presumption that the judge told the jury to -- that it had

20

to make, but the jury did have a finding there, didn't it?

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

The

That is one distinction, but

22

there is also another, which is that in Sullivan the error

23

spanned the entire trial and affected the entire jury

deliberations, and the Court does distinguish between

total and partial deprivations of a Sixth Amendment right.

Mr. Nuechterlein, what is it that the

The failure to give the jury

What is it

that the judge should have said that he didn't say?

The judge should have said

that you must find that the defendant knew that his

silencer was a silencer.

QUESTION:

I've never heard -- look --

the jury instructions, whether that --

being ambiguous.

QUESTION:

Mr. Nuechterlein, isn't it true that

focus on related to count 3, and there wasn't a similar

description with respect to --

QUESTION:

Count 2.

QUESTION:

Count 2.

9

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Well, there actually was

10

similar language in count 2 also, but the difference is

11

that in count 2 the district court also explicitly said --

12

let me get the exact language.
QUESTION:

13

It explicitly says that you don't

14

have to know it was a firearm within the meaning of the

15

statute.

16

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

QUESTION:

Right.

And that's the instructions he

18

wanted, but that is not the instruction that Staples

requires.

21

Staples requires, did he?

Staples merely requires knowledge that it was a

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

3

No,

I think we have addressed

this issue by giving petitioner the benefit of the doubt.

4

QUESTION:

Right.

5

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

This was an ambiguous

6

instruction, and he did -- if you read through the

7

colloquy he did ask for what appeared to be the Staples

8

element, and the district court did deny that request.
QUESTION:

But that might be redundant,

and

10

certainly what Justice Thomas just read doesn't even seem

11

ambiguous.

12

reasonable doubt is that the defendant knowingly

13

possessed -- knowingly possessed the item as charged.

14

What was charged is that he possessed a

15

silencer.

He says, what must be proved beyond a

That's what he told them.
Now, what else was he supposed to say, other

1
20

-inch by 1-3/4

than that?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

It is possible to construe

22

that assumption -- it's possible to construe that

23

instruction as telling the jury that it had to find that

24

he possessed the item and that he knew that he possessed

25

the item, but it is also possible for the jury, given his

subsequent instruction, to find that he was telling them

2

that he might have thought that the item was a pipe.

3

QUESTION:

So in other words, if you charge the

4

defendant with robbing a federally insured bank, or with

5

robbing a bank, you also have to instruct and by the way,

6

you know that a bank is a bank.

was a bank.

8

was a grocery store.

You have to tell the jury he didn't think it

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

9

I'm not following your

question.
QUESTION:

11

Maybe a Federal bank is a better

12

example.

If the crime is that you must knowingly rob a

13

Federal bank, when you say knowingly rob, does it mean

14

that your knowledge just has to extend to the robbing, or

15

does it also have to extend to the fact that it's a

16

Federal bank, and I think it is ambiguous here.

QUESTION:

At least ambiguous, and maybe less

than that.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

QUESTION:

The Moats case, which you cite at the

5

Moats is easily distinguishable by the petitioner, is it

not?

7

I don't think it really

Moats is not an elements case.

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

principle that a defendant is uniquely ill-positioned to

15

claim on appeal that he was denied -QUESTION:

Well, but it's not an element, it's

not instructional error.

It's just not this case.

If we rule for the petitioner, do we have to
overrule any of our cases?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I don't think you have to

16

overrule them, but what you do have to do is, at least in

17

this context, curtail the principle that there is some

18

important relationship between harmless error analysis and

19

the underlying fairness of the defendant's trial.

20

Again, I think Moats does support the general

21

point that a defendant is uniquely ill-positioned to be

22

claiming on appeal that his trial was unfair because the

23

jury was given an inadequate opportunity to find that he

was lying about some issue, and that's --

your answer.

2

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

3

QUESTION:

That was my answer.

In the normal question when we apply

4

a harmless error analysis, we ask, can it be found beyond

5

a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to

6

the verdict.

7

verdict on the necessary elements despite the fact that

8

there was an error, and sometimes the answer is, sure,

What we are asking is, did they return a

because we can tell from what they found, assuming they
10

followed the rest of the instructions, that they must have

11

covered this point as to which specifically the

12

instruction was inadequate.

13

But we can't do that in the case that at least

14

we're assuming we have here in which there was a complete

15

omission of any reference to the element, and it is not

16

claimed that in finding some other element, or some other

17

subsidiary fact, they must have found this element.
So the harmless error analysis is functioning,

18
1

if it is applied here, I think, in an essentially

20

different way from the way it functions in the normal

21

case.

22

Do you agree with that proposition?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I don't think I do agree with

23

that proposition.

I think -- it is true that in the

24

context of instructional errors in a typical case, it is

25

the appropriate rule.

1

The question is whether or not the error had an

2

effect on the jury's deliberations, but those cases all

3

dealt with contested issues, and the defendant's claim was

4

that the jury wasn't given an adequate opportunity to

5

assess the credibility of the Government's evidence.

6

We have a quite different case here, where the

7

defendant's claim is that the jury wasn't given an

8

adequate opportunity to find that he had lied, in effect,

9

about the element that he admitted under oath.

10

QUESTION:

That it was a directed verdict, I

11

mean, that's the strongest -- to put their case in the

12

strongest terms, you can't direct a verdict in a criminal

3

case, and the way you have agreed that this case is shaped

4

presents that question.

5

You said yes, there was a missing instruction on

6

an essential element, but he admitted that element, not at

7

a plea hearing or anything like that, and so pro tanto

8

there is a directed verdict.

9

Now, that's the case that you agreed is

20

presented here.

21

should not have made that agreement, but you did, so can a

22

trial judge direct a verdict on an element in a criminal

23

case on the basis that the defendant has admitted it but

24

hasn't waived his right to a jury trial?

would be different if there had been a directed verdict on

this element so long as the jury was able to assess all

the other elements that he did not admit under oath, and

that essential jury function is missing on one, why, even

that the jury has a very important role to play.

me, was the judge directing a verdict, not omitting an

element in the chart.

No such directed verdict took place

That is correct.

But even in the harmless error context, this

10

Court has held that mandatory conclusive presumptions can

11

be harmless error if certain conditions are met.

12

no substantive difference from a juror's perspective

13

between an omission of an element and a mandatory

14

conclusive presumption.

15

QUESTION:

There is

When there's a mandatory conclusive

16

presumption, the jury comes in with a finding that that

17

element was met pursuant to the presumption, and when you

18

say certain conditions are met, the conditions are that

19

that -- either some other finding would have inevitably

20

led to that, or that it have been admitted, but the jury

21

would have come in with a finding, nonetheless.

22

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

But I think that that

23

finding, Justice Scalia, is an empty formalism, because

24

the jury has been told that it must conclude that that

25

element has been satisfied if it finds that the predicate

element has been satisfied, so there is -- from a juror's

2

perspective there is absolutely no distinction between a

3

mandatory conclusive presumption and the omission that

4

occurred in this case.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Nuechterlein, can I ask you to

6

comment on a rather broad point that is troubling me about

7

this case.
It's been apparent from some of the questioning

8

9

by Justice Thomas and Justice Breyer in particular that

10

the Government elected not to make what was a fairly

11

strong argument that the issue really isn't presented in

12

this case, and this is a terribly important constitutional

3

question affecting State trials all over the country, and

4

this Court, too, and our normal practice is not to address

5

constitutional questions unless absolutely necessary to

6

resolve the case, and you failed in your opposition to the

7

cert petition to tell us, to even make the argument that

8

this --we didn't have to reach this question to decide

9

this case.

20
21

Did you do that because you thought you might

win a huge victory that would cover all these cases?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

That is not it at all.

In

fact, we looked at the instructions very carefully and we

made the determination that in fact the element was not

QUESTION:

You thought it was so clear that even

2

though some of us are troubled by the instruction you

3

didn't even want to point it out to us.

4

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

No, we didn't think it was

5

clear, but where there is a deep ambiguity and the jury

6

can reasonably construe that ambiguity against the need to

7

find the element, we thought that this case was an

appropriate vehicle for addressing the question presented

the petitioner raised.

QUESTION:

Well, if we go to the merits of it,

I mean,

15

this ambiguity is a slight problem, but the question, the

16

sort of deep -- the question I have on the merits is,

forget to say that they have to find that there was a

problem.

4

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

QUESTION:

Right.

So you agree in that case.

All

6

right.

7

you don't agree and it's never -- you always look for

8

harmless error.

9

Then there are only three possibilities.

One is,

The second possibility is that if it's an

10

element of the offense that's omitted, it's never harmless

11

error, and the third possibility is something in between,

12

where you don't think the first two, so you must think

13

something in between, and as to when the omission of the

14

element is, per se, bad, no matter if it's harmless, and

15

when it isn't.

16

Now, the only standard that I've been able to

17

find that might do it is, you'd look to Olano, which is a

18

different context, and you'd say, it is harm -- you can't

19

look for harmless error.

20

structural -- if it seriously affects the fairness,

21

integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

Otherwise, you look to see if it's harmless.

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

That one or some other.
-- if the defendant admits

that element.

That is not structural error.

QUESTION:

Well, even if he -- in other words,

7

if he admits, under oath, I murdered the victim, and what

8

the judge does is walk in and say to the jury, jury, is

9

the defendant guilty or not guilty, and the jury says, of

10

what, they think to themselves.

11

(Laughter.)
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

12

Huh, I won't tell you.

Well, I think that, you know,

Justice Breyer, is a total deprivation of his right to a

2

element of the offense correctly described under the

3

appropriate burden of proof, then the district court's

4

failure to instruct the jury on an element that the

5

defendant admitted under oath can be harmless error.
QUESTION:

6

Well, part of your discussion with

7

Justice Breyer I think is fairly academic.

8

there's an omission of a central part of the charge,

9

whether you say it's never subject to harmless error

I mean, if

10

review or whether you say it's never harmless under a

11

harmless error review may be a nice question for academic

12

discussion, but it comes out the same way.

13

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I think it does, and the --

14

it is also the case that where the jury has not addressed

15

an issue like that it may very well be that the error is

16

not harmless.

17

in almost all the circumstances, but that's not what we

18

have here.

In fact, I would imagine that is the case

19

What we have here is a defendant who asked the

20

jury to accept his statement of fact with respect to his

21

own state of mind, and then, on appeal, has predicated his

defendant's admitting the element bear on your centrality

analysis?

the jury played a central role in the proceeding.

your position.

That is the limiting

principle on our general theory of this case, but

that's --

QUESTION:

I hope

What does the defendant's having

10

admitted the element as opposed, say, to 10 witnesses

11

having testified to it, have to do with that?

12

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I -- again, I think it comes

13

down to your question of procedural fairness, which is

14

what the harmless error doctrine is all about.

It's one thing for a defendant to argue that his

16

trial was unfair because the district court didn't give

17

the jury enough of an opportunity to assess the

18

credibility of the Government's evidence, no matter how

19

compelling that evidence may seem on appeal, but it's

20

quite another thing for a defendant to claim that his

21

trial wasn't fair because the jury didn't have an adequate

22

opportunity to find that his trial testimony, an issue

23

within his knowledge, was false.

render, I don't know why we shouldn't -- if those are of

3

such significance I don't know why we shouldn't change our

4

standard for harmless error review in a very essential

5

respect.
Because we say now, however overwhelming the

6

7

evidence may have been, however adequate the evidence may

8

have been to convict, despite the fact that the jury

9

certainly, let's say, considered 9 out of the 10 elements

10

clearly, and the instructional error only goes to one

11

element, despite the overwhelming power of the evidence on

12

that element, if we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt

13

in effect that the jury did find what was necessary, we

14

reverse.

It's not a sufficiency of the evidence test.
Why shouldn't a sufficiency of the evidence test

15
16

be appropriate so long as the evidence is so overwhelming

17

that there's no unfairness in sending someone away with a

18

record like that, and number 2, in reaching whatever

19

verdict the jury did reach, it certainly engaged in a

20

substantial amount of fact-finding, even if there was an

21

error with respect to one element.
Why doesn't each of your central conditions get

22

23

satisfied on, we'll say, a sufficiency of the evidence

24

test, whereas in normal harmless error review that isn't

25

enough?

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

1

2

I think that the difference

is with respect to the first of those that you identified.

3

There is an extremely important qualitative

4

difference between a claim that the jury should have been

5

interposed between the Government's proof on some element

6

and the defendant.

7

circumstance that we have here, where the defendant's

8

claim is that the district court should have interposed a

9

jury between the defendant and his own unequivocal

10
11

That is very different from the

testimony.
QUESTION:

It's not in a case in which a

12

stipulation is involved, and yet if a stipulation of fact

13

is involved and nothing more, we don't say sufficiency of

14

the evidence is enough.

15

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I actually think that a

16

defendant's sworn testimony on an issue within his

17

peculiar knowledge should be more binding on appeal than a

18

stipulation would be.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Nuechterlein, can I ask about the

20

sworn testimony here.

21

that he knew that a silencer was a silencer at the time

22

that he possessed it?

23

did -- was it very clear from his testimony that generally

speaking he now knows what silencers are.

couldn't have made such an admission.

Mr. Nuechterlein, before you

conclude, you say admission, and there are admissions and

admissions.

something when he's testifying from the stand.

that.

So the admission comes in many sizes and shapes,
and how, if we adopt your rule, do we guard against the

10

possibility that a defendant will be trapped by an

11

inadvertent admission?

12

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Well, I -- I mean, I think

3

that it is always the role of a reviewing court to

4

determine what the facts of the case are, and there is no

5

particular impediment in determining that he testified

6

about some -- about his own state of mind, which is an

7

issue within his peculiar knowledge, and that he did so

8

under circumstances where there was no question about

9

whether he was telling the truth.

20

In other words, this is a case where, if his

21

admission was false, it was knowingly false.

22

false, it was because he lied on the stand at trial.

If it was

I think it's also -- I mean, it's significant to

think about what would happen if this trial were -- if in

The new trial would not be about this element at all,

because the testimony of his admission here would be

QUESTION:

10

Mr. Nuechterlein, just a couple of

11

clarifications.

In the court of appeals' opinion, the

12

court of appeals says, as discussed above the district

13

court, over defense objection, refused to inform the jury

14

that the Government had the burden of showing Rogers knew

15

the item in questions were firearms under the act.

16

In the question presented in this case, in the

17

cert petition, the petitioner says that the trial court,

18

over the objection of the defense counsel, the timely

1

objection of defense counsel, refused to instruct the jury

20

that the Government as an element of the offense charged

21

was required to prove that petitioner knew the item in

22

question was a firearm within the meaning of the statute.

23

Now, does the Government concede that the

24

failure to object that the silencer was a firearm is an

25

error?

QUESTION:

That's the error that the court of

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I had understood the court of

the jury that it must find that the firearm possessed the
