ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURNES:

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Petitioner Terry Campbell has been improperly

11

denied standing to raise the equal protection, due

12

process, and Sixth Amendment fair cross-section objections

13

to the grand jury which indicted him.

14

acknowledged and undisputed de facto racial discrimination

practiced against African Americans in Evangeline Parish,

petitioner was denied the opportunity to object solely

because he is white.

Despite the

The case is about petitioner's

The case is not about gender, retroactive
application to other cases, or overturning Hobby.
The facts in the case are simple and undisputed.

QUESTION:

Is it true that there's never been a

nonwhite foreman in Evangeline County?

5

MR. BURNES:

I would not know past the evidence

presented to the trial court.

7

presented to the trial court there was never a black

selected.

I don't know historically, back through the

QUESTION:

10

For the period of evidence

But you're saying from the years --

11

what time frame are we talking about that there has been

12

no nonwhite?

13

MR. BURNES:

A 16-1/2 year time period during

14

which generally there are supposed to be two grand juries

15

selected each year.

16

grand jury selected, so it was a string of 35 consecutive

17

white grand jury forepersons.

QUESTION:

19

MR. BURNES:

21

QUESTION:

23

There's a difference in the way the

foreperson is selected in New Orleans, is that right?

22

One year I believe there was only one

I believe there is, Your Honor.
Is the experience any different

there?
MR. BURNES:

I would not know that.

way things are --

MR. BURNES:

I would say, Your Honor, that there

have been cases brought up in a lot of the parishes in

Louisiana, in Sabine Parish, I believe in Lafayette Parish

and Lake Charles.

lot of the parishes there.

MR. BURNES:

The issue of nonselection of whites

I don't have a list of exactly which

So apparently other parishes are

To a greater or lesser extent, yes,

Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

Let me ask you, since you're

17

interrupted, how -- you make a fair-cross-section-of-the-

18

jury claim with regard to the foreperson of the jury?

19

MR. BURNES:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Fair

20

cross-section, Sixth Amendment fair cross-section claims,

21

generally --

22

QUESTION:

How would that work in connection

23

with a single person, a foreperson?

process, but it certainly isn't clear to me how a fair

2

cross-section claim could be made out.

3

MR. BURNES:

You're right, Your Honor, in prior

4

courts -- in prior cases this Court has found problems in

5

applying fair cross-section to a single person.

6

has concentrated on groups that the fair cross-section

7

applies to.

QUESTION:

claim, nonetheless.

10

MR. BURNES:

11

In fact, there are --

12

13
14

QUESTION:

The Court

Right, so -- but you're pursuing that

Oh, yes, Your Honor, definitely.

Well, would you like to justify it,

since you're pursuing it?
MR. BURNES:

Yes, Your Honor.

In fact, there

15

are two groups that the fair cross-section claim can be

16

focused upon.

17

have a grand jury where 11 of them are chose randomly and

18

fairly, we would submit, and then the twelfth member is

19

chosen unfairly, always chosen as a white person.

20

going to distort that group.

21

cross-section in the grand jury itself.

One is a grand jury group as a whole.

You

That's

You don't have the fair

22

But even more importantly, the -- if you look at

23

the grand jury venire, the approximately 300 people called

24

to court that day whose names are going to be drawn and

25

placed on the grand jury, the judge gets to the point

QUESTION:

That effective grand jury

How does this work?

There are 300

people on the big venire that are called?
MR. BURNES:

Your Honor, I'm not 100-percent

sure about the number of 300.

A large number of people

are called, given summons to show up for jury duty.
QUESTION:

And the judge selects someone from

that large number to be the foreperson of the grand jury.

13

MR. BURNES:

14

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
And then subsequently the other

15

members of the grand jury are selected at random by a

16

clerk or something of that sort.

17

MR. BURNES:

Your Honor, that's the way the

18

Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 413 reads.

19

The judge -- I don't know that the code article

20

specifically means that he has to make his selection

21

before the other ones are chosen.

22

When I looked through the minutes for the past

23

16-1/2 years, generally they seemed to indicate that the

24

12 -- the 11 were drawn at random and then the judge

25

selected someone else sitting in there, and again

occasionally minutes are entered very loosely or just from

MR. BURNES:

What does the foreperson of a grand

Your Honor, that is pointed out in

7

the State's brief at page 26.

8

provide that the foreman shall preside over all hearings,

9

may delegate duties to other grand jurors, and may

10
11

The statutory provisions

determine rules or procedures.
This basically means that he leads the

12

discussions, he decides when to vote, how to vote, and

13

what to vote on.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BURNES:

16
17
18
19

Can he cast a vote himself?
Oh, yes, he does.

He is one of the

12 voting members of the grand jury, and that is -QUESTION:

And that was left out of the State's

description of his powers at page 26.
MR. BURNES:

I don't think the State was trying

20

to mislead.

21

attempting to show some of the other powers of the grand

22

jury for --

23

I think the State was at that point in 26

because he has some duties that might be called

3

MR. BURNES:

And that I believe is the very-

important fact in here.

4

Petitioner Campbell takes the position that

this -- this Court has had previous cases saying you

6

cannot pick a grand jury unfairly.

7

member of the grand jury is picked unfairly.
Petitioner Campbell has equal -- has raised

9

equal protection --

10

QUESTION:

11

Is that different, then, from the

situation in the Hobby case that we had?

12

MR. BURNES:

13

QUESTION:

14

Here, one voting

In the Hobby case -Where the Court said the grand jury

foreman in that case had a ministerial role?
MR. BURNES:

15

The basic difference is, in the

16

Hobby case a grand jury, the entire grand jury is selected

17

in a fair manner and then that one person, the grand jury

18

foreman, is given the job of doing the clerk duties for

19

the grand jury, but the point is that whole grand jury was

20

chosen in a fair manner.
QUESTION:

21
22

23
24
25

But in Hobby how was the foreman

chosen?
MR. BURNES:

I believe he was chosen by the

judge, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Why is that different?

Why is that

different from your case?
MR. BURNES:

2

It's different because the judge is

3

looking at the grand jury, the entire grand jury panel who

4

was chosen in a fair fashion.

5

In Louisiana, ll/12ths of the grand jury is

6

chosen in a fair fashion and then the grand jury foreman

7

is chosen not from the panel but from the venire sitting

8

out there, and that choice is made in a discriminatory

9

fashion.

10
11

That choice is always made for a white grand

jury foreperson.
QUESTION:

12

objection, wasn't it?

13

always white.

14

MR. BURNES:

But in Hobby it was the same
The foreman or foreperson was

The objection -- yes, the objection

15

was that the foreperson was always white.

16

here is that the foreperson was always white, but here

17

it's that the voting member was chosen in a discriminatory

18

manner to sit on the grand jury.

20

the grand jury.

QUESTION:

The objection

In Hobby, there was no

But a choice was just made in a

22

discriminatory fashion by people already chosen.

23

the discrimination is still there.

MR. BURNES:

I mean,

Oh, there is a discrimination and

at that point you would look to -- and Hobby focused on

21

result ever been anything other than the conviction got

Your Honor, the conviction was not set aside.

this Court held that the petitioner failed to prove his

prima facie case and did not set aside the conviction, so

3

there are cases, there are times when this Court may find

roadblock in this case.

exact statement, fairly derived from those questions,

QUESTION:

This Court also has rules that

Fairly subsumed, I think.

I think

10

that means that the general -- that the language of the

question includes something that perhaps is lesser, or --

but it seems to me standing and remedy are two very

13

distinct things.

MR. BURNES:

Your Honor is correct, standing and

In this case, Mr. Campbell has been

This Court, if it rules that Mr. Campbell has

question, does it go forward and say what the remedy in

MR. BURNES:

15

That's correct, Your Honor, and I

haven't had a chance to say it yet, but the equal

Are you also raising -- urging that

MR. BURNES:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That

is the second part, the more sophisticated equal

protection claim that comes under the Powers third party

standing, that Mr. Campbell is in a position to adequately

11

put forth their rights, all of the analysis that was in

12

the Powers case, that he has a relationship with the

excluded jurors, so --

QUESTION:

The first equal protection question

15

is sort of -- I mean, it's a very strange assertion of

equal protection.

that the State's brief has attacked whether there's

attention, if I could, to the State's brief.

2

its brief does agree in some forms with the petitioner

3

Campbell's claims on all three grounds.

The State in

With respect to the equal protection ground, at

5

page 22, note 9, the State of Louisiana recognizes this

6

Court's decision that if discrimination in the selection

7

of the grand jury itself occurs, the proper remedy is

8

reversal of the subsequent conviction, and that's what

9

happened here.

There was discrimination in the selection

10

of the grand jury itself.

Grand juror number 12 was

11

chosen in a discriminatory manner.
With respect to the due process claim on page 26

12

13

and note 12, in Guice 2 the Fifth Circuit noted that

14

because the foreman in Louisiana is selected from the

15

venire rather from the grand jury itself, any

16

discrimination in the selection of a foreman necessarily

17

taints the composition of the grand jury as well.

18

of its 12 members were chosen at random.

19

the petitioner may obtain relief by challenging the

20

composition of the grand jury, and this he has failed to

21

do.

22

Only 11

If that is so,

But, in fact, that is what Mr. Campbell has been

doing from the beginning.

discriminatory manner, has always been chosen white.

And on page 30, under the B heading with respect

2

to the Sixth Amendment argument, the State writes, if this

3

Court decides that the Sixth Amendment itself is

4

implicated regardless of whether the judicial body at

5

issue is the grand jury or just the grand jury foreman,

6

then the State concedes that under Holland v. Illinois

7

petitioner has standing to assert a Sixth Amendment

8

challenge.

9

It's the law, the Constitution and its

10

amendments and the prior decisions of this Court, that

11

have forced the State to make concessions on these issues.

12

In the dissent by Justice Scalia, to which Chief Justice

13

Rehnquist joined in the case of Powers v. Ohio, there's a

14

statement.
It would be absurd to -- and this is at page

15
16

1379 in the Supreme Court Recorder 111.

It would be

17

absurd to suppose that a black juror has a right not to be

18

discriminated against through peremptory strike in the

19

trial of a black defendant but not in the trial of a white

20

defendant.

However, this is the absurd position the State

21

has taken.

An African American prospective grand juror

22

has a right not to be discriminated against in the

23

selection of the grand jury foreperson in cases involving

24

black defendants but not in cases involving white

defendants.

That's correct, Your Honor.
Do you concede that at least the

petitioner has third party standing under Powers?
MR. IEYOUB:

6

No, Your Honor, not in any sense

7

and the reason I don't is because, in finding that the

8

petitioner in Powers satisfied the three criteria

9

necessary for third party standing, that is, injury in

10

fact, relationship to the third party, and hindrance to

11

the third party itself being able to bring an action, the

12

Court placed strong emphasis on the importance of the voir

13

dire phase of the trial and the adverse impact that

14

discrimination during voir dire -- the voir dire stage

15

would have on the fairness of the trial itself.
In finding injury in fact, this Court pointed

16
17

out that when there's discrimination during the voir dire

18

stage by the use of peremptory challenges the

19

discrimination is in the body that's going to decide guilt

Peters v. Kiff was such a case, where the entire

Rose v. Mitchell did involve

the same.

One of the points made in Powers was that the

20

person who was excluded from being on the jury in one

case, yes, the grand jury, that is -- was a most unlikely

challenger, so you have to have this kind of surrogate

that, as you said, Your Honor, that it would be very

me if I'm wrong, in Hobby a grand jury was selected.

But look -- look -- I mean, I have no

I do have a

problem on the merits of the due process claim, which is

supposed to be an assertion that the conviction here was

fundamentally unfair.
Your client had a petit jury, fairly chosen --

you made no claim that that wasn't fairly chosen -- which

found your client guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the

crime alleged.
Now, the only function of the grand jury

beforehand is not to find whether he's guilty beyond a

12

reasonable doubt, but to find whether there's reason to

13

believe, adequate reason to believe that he might have

committed it, to have him tried.
Well, my goodness, we've gone beyond that.

I mean, I -- you know, it's a terrible thing to

6

exclude people like that, and maybe somebody had -- I'm

7

sure a black grand juror who has been excluded could set

8

it right, or the Justice Department could bring suit to

9

set it right, but I don't see why your client has been

10

convicted in a fundamentally unfair manner.

11

petit jury that, fairly chosen, found him guilty beyond a

12

reasonable doubt.

13

MR. BURNES:

He's had a

Mr. Campbell was convicted.

14

However, he has the right to have the grand jury look at

15

the evidence and say, we're only going to indict for

16

manslaughter.

17

QUESTION:

He has that right and there was an

18

error made and somebody should correct that, but did that

19

error deprive him of -- make his conviction fundamentally

20

unfair?

21

It's only his conviction.

I mean, if you're

22

asking for something else, money damages or, you know,

23

something different, maybe you've got a claim there, but

24

your client's conviction was fundamentally unfair --

25

MR. BURNES:

Your Honor, we aren't arguing that

1

the conviction was fundamentally unfair.

2

that he was denied his rights at that grand jury stage.

3

QUESTION:

We are arguing

Well, in the Mechanic case in the

4

Federal courts we held that even though a Federal grand

5

jury does not conform to the requirements set up by

6

Congress, nonetheless, if the person is convicted, the

7

shortcomings of the grand jury are harmless error.

8

doesn't the same thing follow in this situation insofar as

9

your due process claim is concerned?

10

MR. BURNES:

Why

Your Honor, there's -- because the

11

long line of cases from this Court which find that racial

12

discrimination at the grand jury --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BURNES:

But those are not due process cases.
Well, with respect to the due

15

process, I believe there is a due process harm there when,

16

in order to be convicted and sentenced to a life sentence

17

in Louisiana, the citizen has a right to the indictment by

18

the grand jury and the grand jury here was not impartial,

19

did not have -- he was not --

20

QUESTION:

Well, when you say not impartial that

21

suggests that some members of the grand jury were

22

prejudiced against your client.

23

of that, is there?

24

MR. BURNES:

25

QUESTION:

Now, there's no evidence

Well, as -Is there?

MR. BURNES:

1

Your Honor, there is no evidence in

2

the record of that and you can't see the evidence in the

3

record of that and that's pointed out very clearly in the

4

Vasquez v. Hillery case, where --

9

Which was an equal protection case.

You're just melding together the

Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and
the Due Process Clause, it seems to me.
MR. BURNES:

11

Well, Your Honor, the analysis, the

12

argument right there that you cannot tell what the harm is

13

because you're not allowed to look at those deliberations

14

and look at those votes is equally as strong in the due

15

process area as in the equal protection area.
QUESTION:

16

You know, this seems to be sort of

17

the gaming theory of criminal justice.

18

a different grand jury, might have been lucky enough to

19

get a jury that didn't find sufficient cause to bring an

20

indictment, might have been that lucky, although it's

21

clear there was sufficient cause to bring an indictment.

22

Indeed, he was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

fairness.

Peters v. Kiff, Your Honor, is a

case involving I believe petit juries.

QUESTION:

And grand jury both, I think.

13

MR. BURNES:

14

Here, the harm is that he's not given a chance

And extended to grand juries.

15

for the grand jury to say, you know, this defendant may or

may not have done that, we're going to only find for

17

manslaughter, and not subject him to that life sentence.

Was there a majority opinion for the

Your Honors, I'd like to address a few more issues.
One is that General Ieyoub raised the point that

1

only 9 votes were needed by the grand jury again on that

2

case that would seem to be urging an issue, urging a rule

3

that we could discriminate on 3 out of the 12 grand jury

4

members, still get 9 votes from the other ones and have a

5

valid indictment.

6

I don't believe that is a good rule.

General Ieyoub has also argued that the

7

Louisiana supreme court has said that the grand jury

8

foreman is ministerial, but you have to look at where the

9

grand jury -- where the Louisiana supreme court said that.

10

That was in this case which is under review here.
The problem here that there was systematic

11
12

exclusion by the judge and that Petitioner Campbell has

13

been denied standing to raise these claims.

14

State has argued against it they start going to the merits

15

of the claims.

16

this or prove that with respect to due process, yet

17

Petitioner Campbell isn't given an opportunity to prove

18

whether there was a due process violation or an equal

19

protection violation or a Sixth Amendment violation when

20

he's not given standing to assert them.

They start saying how he's got to prove

If there's no other questions, I'd yield my
