ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. HUDSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. HUDSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:
Plaintiffs' claims that Brunswick negligently

13

failed to protect against propeller guard injuries in the

14

circumstances of this case should not be preempted for

15

three reasons.

16

in this case do not conflict with any Federal regulation.

17

Under Freightliner,

18

Secondly,

First of all, the claims we are bringing

there's no preemption.
the text of the preemption clause,

19

section 4306 of the act, does not, much less clearly and

20

unambiguously, reach the body of State law of general

21

application, common law damage claims.

22

is consistent, we think, with all of the preemption cases

23

of this Court.

24
25

Our position there

Thirdly, in this case the reading that we submit
for the preemption clause is confirmed by a particular

2

qualification provided that compliance with the Boat

Safety Act regulation is no defense to common law claims.
In this preemption case, as in every case of

signalling that State laws would have a role to play.

It spoke

And then throughout the act Congress over and

over again speaks of the enactment of positive regulations

MR. HUDSON:

Yes, Your Honor, there has a been a

holding that the common law can lead to a requirement.

don't think that --

QUESTION:

Can lead to?

It is.

I mean, they

6

are requirements, and I don't see why we should

7

necessarily create -- treat this statute differently in

8

that regard.

MR. HUDSON:

Well, for a couple of reasons.

The

10

language used in this statute is different than the

11

language used in both Cipollone and in Medtronic.

Miller, Silkwood, has explained that common law is a

18

traditional State area.

In this

In both Cipollone and Medtronic it was

If we were to obtain a judgment in this case,

20

Brunswick would not be required to put a propeller guard

21

on any of its boats in any State, or in any jurisdiction.

It would have the discretion as a manufact --

MR. HUDSON:

2

QUESTION:

3

Even then
Isn't that what you're going to argue

to the jury?

4

MR. HUDSON:

Even then, Your Honor, it may not

5

be necessary that they actually install a propeller guard.

6

It may be enough that a warning be issued putting

7

consumers on notice that if you are thrown or fall out of

8

this boat there's a danger of this type of injury.

9
10

We assert in our complaint that they had this
knowledge, and they had -QUESTION:

11

Well, I take it that the main thrust

12

of your argument below is that the propeller guard should

13

have been installed.

You're going to change the behavior

14

of the manufacturer.

That's the whole justification, at

15

least for your punitive damage award, punitive damage

16

claim.

17

MR. HUDSON:

To award compensation to the

18

injured victim is the first purpose.

19

claim is a heightened incentive to do the steps that are

20

necessary to protect persons who use the boats.

21

have that impact.

22

The punitive damage

It would

But as this Court acknowledged in Silkwood,

23

punitive damage is a customary part of the State common

24

law damage scheme and just because it's a punitive damage

claim married with a claim for general damages does not

create any heightened point of reference to preempt a

2

State law claim.
QUESTION:

3

On that very point, if -- imagine

4

that the Coast Guard here had said what it didn't say, but

5

suppose it said we think that the guards on these

6

propellers are actually a greater danger than an unguarded

7

propeller because somebody can get hit on the head, and

8

that's a bigger chance of harm than the other, so suppose

9

because of that they'd said very clearly, we don't want

10
11

guards.
Now, on your view of the statute a jury would be

12

perfectly free to award punitive damages against the

13

manufacturer because he did the very thing that the Coast

14

Guard told him to do.

15

the statute?

MR. HUDSON:

Now, what sense would that make of

Under that reading it wouldn't make

sense, Justice Breyer, and I'd like to - QUESTION:

So how do you prevent -- how do you

19

read it your way, which is to say, it preserves common law

20

claims, and yet avoid what you've just said is a

21

ridiculous result?

22

MR. HUDSON:

May I assume in your question that

23

you are referring to the Coast Guard adopting a regulation

24

saying thou shalt not have propeller guards, and then not

25

as a matter of preemption, but I think as a matter of the

MR. HUDSON:

MR. HUDSON:

No.

I think it is -- that is a

liability claim under State law, but you asked what is the

23

purpose of the savings clause if you cannot bring a claim

24

that is diametrically opposed to a Federal regulation,

25

which is not our case.

QUESTION:

I'm trying to get your view on it.

3

thought your view was that the common law was simply

preserved.

is simply preserved in the absence of a specific

6

determination by the Coast Guard.

7

That's a different view.

Now I take it your view is that the common law

MR. HUDSON:

8

I

Is that your view?

No, sir, I think that is our view,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

10

So in other words your view is that

11

the savings clause does nothing if the Coast Guard - -

12

it -- the savings clause is necessary, I guess, in your

13

view.

14

the Coast Guard preempts the tort remedy, but other than a

15

straight rule it doesn't, is that the view?

16

It's just that this prempt -- a straight rule of

MR. HUDSON:

Well, it depends on whether or not

17

there's a conflict, because if they say thou shalt not

18

have a propeller guard, then our claim would be barred.

19

QUESTION:

Suppose it simply --

20

QUESTION:

Well, but you told me that State

21

common law couldn't be a requirement and could never have

22

any preemptive effect, so you can't have it both ways.

MR. HUDSON:

No, but before you get to - - I

25

what Congress preempted in the section under question.

4

QUESTION:

These are different from

Of course, that reference to State

5

law might be an indication that the only -- that the

6

general preemption clause should be read to mean that

7

there is no preemption unless there is a positive

8

enactment of Federal law.

9

of -- and that's not the way the Coast Guard read it right

10

after the act, after the passage of act, but it could mean

11

that too, couldn't it?

12

MR. HUDSON:

That might be one indication

I think that is the most logical

13

reading, because when you read 4306 in conjunction with

14

4305, what you are permitted to obtain exemption from if

15

you apply to the Coast Guard is from existing rules and

16

regulations of the Coast Guard.

17

Furthermore, if you read the statute where it

18

says at the conclusion, unless identical to a regulation

19

comprised under section 4302, that's surplus.

20

Congress intended to do was to say the only regulation

21

we're going to have are positive enactments of the Coast

22

Guard, then you don't need that language in the statue

23

that says, unless identical to the regulations prescribed

24

under this section.

1

2

I mean, there's an ambiguity there.
I suppose you could read it as saying, all State

3

law goes unless the Coast Guard has adopted a regulation

4

and State law is identical to that regulation, or you

5

could read it as saying, all State law stays unless there

6

is a Coast Guard regulation and in that case the only

7

State law that stays is that which is identical.

8

could read it either way, I suppose, textually.

9

You

The reference to State law in the savings clause

10

as distinct from common law might be an indication of

11

which of those two possible readings you should take, i.e.

12

that the State law is preserved in the absence of a

13

positive enactment with conflict.

14

MR. HUDSON:

To that I would respond, Justice

15

Souter, that the former reading, why do you need State

16

laws that simply parrot an existing Federal regulation

17

that has been enacted by the Coast Guard.

18

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.

19

MR. HUDSON:

20

I would further say, if you have a statue that

The conduct is being regulated.

21

can be read both ways under the clear and unambiguous

22

standard that this Court cites in every one of its

23

preemption cases, that in itself proves that at the very

24

least this would be an ambiguous statute.

25

QUESTION:

1

You don't -- we don't have to resolve

2

that question, I take it, to decide in your favor, because

3

the Government is taking the position, I assume, that the

4

Coast Guard is right when the Coast Guard says, we're the

5

only ones in the standard-setting business, so to reach

6

your common law claim we don't have to decide -MR. HUDSON:

7

That is correct, because from the

8

time of the enactment of the act and through the present

9

time the Coast Guard has never taken the position that

10

common law claims of general application of State laws are

11

preempted.

12

QUESTION:

May I ask you about the -- whether

the Georgia -- the question of Georgia law of -- to

introduce to this jury the fact that the Coast Guard did

not make a regulation requiring propeller guards would be

16

relevant, wouldn't it?

MR. HUDSON:

At least the underlying facts that

18

caused the Coast Guard not to do anything, and the Coast

19

Guard to decide not to do anything because they couldn't

20

come up with a common solution and it might expensive and

the data was incomplete.

QUESTION:

3

And the fact that the Coast Guard

that has set other standards didn't set this one.
MR. HUDSON:

Yes,

I think that could, because it

will be a very limited application, even when it comes in,

because the Coast Guard's action was very narrow in scope,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:

4
5

and may it please the Court:
Justice Scalia, it's at page 2 of the red brief.

6

7

Actually, sorry, page 1 of the red brief, 4305.
We agree with petitioners that common law claims

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

are not expressly preempted or impliedly preempted by

10

Coast Guard regulations that don't exist in this case.

11

Congress had two very good reasons to differentiate

12

between positive law enactments and common law remedies

13

that might be available.
The first is that common law remedies give

14
15

manufacturers a choice as to whether or not they would

16

change their product design or to install some particular

17

equipment.

18

whether assuming the risk that their product might cause a

19

danger and thereby incur liability is worth the cost of

20

redesigning the equipment or putting on some type of

21

propeller guard, and that --

They could make a cost-benefit analysis of

QUESTION:

What about punitives?

23

QUESTION:

We've heard that argument before.

We

24

heard it in Cipollone.

We hear it in every case where the

25

issue is whether common law remedies are precluded, and we

have not found it persuasive.

2

MR. FREDERICK:

3

QUESTION:

Well, Justice Scalia --

I mean, it's true, you can roll the

4

dice if you like.

5

about an explicit regulatory prohibition and there's

6

especially very little difference when you have punitive

7

damages.

8

I suppose you can say the same thing

I mean, I could ignore a regulation, too, can't
I, and say it's a cost of business.

A cost of doing

10

business is now and then I'll get picked up for violating

11

the regulation.

12

regulation just as well as about a common law liability.

13

It's worth it.

MR. FREDERICK:

I can say that about a

Justice Scalia, I'm trying to

14

set forth the reasons why in 1 71, when Congress enacted

15

this statute, it may have differentiated it.

16

is that it legislated against a backdrop, the historical

17

traditions of the country that if people were injured they

18

would have the ability to bring a tort claim, and so the

1

words that it used in setting out in sections 4302, 4306,

20

and 4311(g) used words that suggest positive law

21

enactments would be preempted in 4306 and that common law

22

liability would be saved --

23

QUESTION:

The second

Is that true even if the Coast Guard

24

has a particular rule?

I mean, suppose the Coast Guard

25

said, look, this is obviously a tough question whether you

should have propeller guards or not.

2

both ways, and if the -- you don't want to make a mistake.

3

So the Coast Guard says, we don't want it.

4

people are killed with the propeller guards than without.

5

People are killed

We think more

Are you saying under those circumstances in your

6

view a State is perfectly free to award $50, $60, $100

7

million in punitive damages for doing the very thing the

8

Coast Guard said not to do?

MR. FREDERICK:

QUESTION:

MR. FREDERICK:

14

We think implied conflict

preemption --

11

13

No.

Ah.
-- principles would be

applicable.
QUESTION:

So in other words it's just the fact

15

they don't have a particular reg here that this turns on,

16

in your opinion.

17

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, the savings clause should

18

not be read to eviscerate the power that Congress gave the

19

Coast Guard to promulgate affirmative regulations, so that

20

if in exercising that power that Congress gave the Coast

21

Guard the Coast Guard promulgates a regulation that

22

prohibits propeller guards, it would be anomalous to read

23

the savings clause to bring it into conflict with that.

24
25

QUESTION:

So if they have a reg -- suppose they

do have a reg.

1

MR. FREDERICK:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

In your view, should we look to see

3

whether that reg, there's a direct conflict with the State

4

law or common law State -- you know, the tort judgment,

5

whether it - - the State tort judgment would defeat an

6

object of the reg, or whether the state judgment would be

7

in an area that the reg clearly intends to reserve to the

8

Coast Guard -- that's your view of it?
MR. FREDERICK:

9

QUESTION:

10

That's correct.

Okay.

All of the --

If that's your view of it, why

11

doesn't that apply -- and I think maybe that is a

12

perfectly good view.

13

to a State positive regulation as it would to a tort

14

action?

Why doesn't that just as much apply

MR. FREDERICK:

15

Because in 4306 the words that

16

Congress used, it started out by saying, unless permitted

17

by the Secretary, and everything else follows.

18

terms that parallel the terms that were used in 4302 which

19

allow the Secretary to prom -- to establish a safety

20

standard.

21

It uses

If you then look at 4306 you see the parallel

22

reference to, a State shall not be allowed to do a law or

23

regulation that establishes a standard or in 4302(a)(2) it

24

says, or impose a requirement or require a - - an

25

associated equipment device.

2

You then look at 4306.

After the or, it says,

or impose a requirement for associated equipment.

3

In our view, the language the Congress used in

4

4302 was to say, these are the things that the Secretary

5

is authorized to issue regulations about, and then in 4306

6

it says, unless the Secretary permits, a State can't do

7

those things which the Secretary is empowered to do in

8

4302, and --

9

QUESTION:

The trouble I find with this

10

analysis, that you rely just on implied preemption for

11

common law, is that would be very peculiar

12

which in 4306 insists that the Statelaw be identical,

13

that the

14

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, to the contrary, Justice

Scalia.
If a regulation that a State promulgates is

20

written in words that are going to be easily compared with

21

a Federal standard it would be very easy to determine

22

whether it was identical or not identical.

23

And the fact that Congress used the phrase,

24

liability under common law inthe savings provisions

25

4311(g), but did not use the phrase, common law to show

1

that which was to be preempted in 4306 is further textual

2

support for our view that those things which were to be

3

preempted in 4306 were positive enactments of State law

4

that would be done by State executive officers because, in

5

fact, they will have to apply to the Secretary for the

6

exemption from a preemption, and they are the ones who

7

have to seek that authority in order to keep that in

8

place, so it is true that --

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Why would a State want to have a

regulation that was identical with the Federal regulation?
MR. FREDERICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, the history

12

of it is that the Coast Guard recognized that it lacked

13

the resources in order to enforce all of these provisions

14

with the tens of millions of boats that were out there, so

15

in fact when the Commandant of the Coast Guard testified

16

he urged Congress to provide a scheme that would allow

17

States to promulgate parallel --an identical regulation

18

so that State enforcement officers could go and help with

19

the enforcement of the safety standards.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

The States couldn't help enforce the

Coast Guard regulation?
MR. FREDERICK:

It wasn't clear at the time

23

whether in the absence of that explicit authority and

24

provision that State officers would have the incentive or

25

necessarily the power to do that, so when the Commandant

1

of the Coast Guard testified before the Senate committee

2

he made very clear that what the concern that the Coast

3

Guard had was the positive enactments that would be

4

conflicting with State law.
And he also made clear in response to a written

5
6

question that was given to him in advance of his testimony

7

so he had additional time to think about it that private

8

remedies would be available to people if they were injured

9

as a result of an unsafe device that was put on a boat.
So we think the legislative history, the

10
11

structure and the text make very clear that what Congress

12

was intending to do in 4306 was to deal with State

13

positive law enactments.

14

I would like to address, briefly address the

15

respondent's theory of the savings clause, because in our

16

view it doesn't really make that much sense.

17

two theories.

They have

The first is that the savings clause was

22

23

published by the American Law Institute in 1965.

24
25

In our view, that is incorrect, because it was
It was in the Second

regulation would not relieve someone of liability if a

1

reasonable person acting under the same or similar

2

circumstances would do otherwise.

3

So that theory for the savings clause really

4

doesn't make much sense.

5

for Congress to have added a specific savings provision.

6

There would have been no need

The second theory that they have is that the

7

savings clause was intended to save against breach of

8

warranty or manufacturing defect claims.

9

theory in our view doesn't make any sense because you

can't read 4306 to preempt those things, so - QUESTION:

Do you think the American Law

of the States?

That hasn't been my experience.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

15

QUESTION:

Well, I think --

I mean, I think there would be real

16

reason to put that in just in case a number of States were

17

following it.

18

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Scalia, even if you were

19

to say that what Congress was intending to do was to put

20

the ALI's view right into law, the words that Congress

21

used made very clear that general provisions of common law

22

liability are to be preserved, because it didn't say

23

liability under common law, especially breach of warranty

24

or product defect claims.

25

textual limitation that the respondents would read into

the savings clause.

2

So I think that if you look at the way that

respondent's theory spells, you know, out what the savings

clause was intended to do,

much of a reason to do it, and --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
We heard 25 minutes of argument this morning
from the plaintiffs and the Solicitor General explaining
why it's perfectly permissible for the State of Georgia
through its common law to impose a requirement that boats
be equipped with propeller guards, but if Georgia can do
this, then presumably South Carolina could through its
common law impose a requirement that boats not be equipped
with propeller guards for the reasons that, as the Coast
Guard found, they make boats less safe.
Now - QUESTION:

Well, excuse me.

the Coast Guard had found that at all.

I didn't know that
The Solicitor

General's brief sets out a portion of the Coast Guard's
letter stating the reason that it was going to take no
actions.

This is on page 7 of the SG's brief.

At least

in the excerpt there the Coast Guard didn't make any such
finding.

Is there more material?

although it did find -- it did agree with the

21

recommendations of the underlying committees that it

22

shouldn't impose a prop guard requirement.

border between South Carolina and Georgia, and the

explain how a manufacturer could possibly build a boat

that could operate on that body of water and still comply

with these divergent State law.

that would be preempted if it did as well.

simply to explain why there's a need for a national

uniform rule here, which Congress recognized in passing

this statute.

My point is

It's so you have one single rule that

MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

But the language -And that may leave open some room for

application of State law.
MR. GELLER:

I think that the language of the

Coast Guard has always interpreted the provision according

to its plain language to preempt State law involving

desire to have uniform national requirements.

In fact, this act was passed in 1971.

after the act was passed -- the day after -- the Coast

Well, of course, that included, as I

understand it, State regulatory requirements in the narrow

sense, so that it did not necessarily imply that the Coast

point is, I don't think you can infer from that that the

Coast Guard ever took the position that a common law

requirement was, in fact, preempted.

15

MR. GELLER:

No.

I'm taking from that the

understanding, which has been in existence since the

beginning of the statute, that even in the absence of a

whether to put on or off the propeller guard, because one

2

jury, the first jury may find it was negligent not to have

3

it, and that -- certainly that finding that it was

4

negligent not to have a propeller guard does not prevent a

5

subsequent South Carolina juror, jury from finding that it

6

was negligent to have a propeller guard, isn't that right?

7

MR. GELLER:

That's true.

That's why it seems

8

completely irrational for Congress to have prohibited

9

State legislatures or State boating commissioners from

10

entering this area, because it was concerned about the

11

need for national uniform regulation, one rule that every

12

manufacturer could follow throughout the United States,

13

and to create an exception for common law rules, which is

14

I think the point that Justice Breyer made last year in

15

his separate opinion in Medtronic, but --

16

QUESTION:

But isn't the argument for exception

17

oddly enough supported by the advisory committee's report

18

here, and that is that the designs of boats vary so

19

enormously that it would be difficult, if not impossible,

20

to have a uniform rule in the sense of saying, all boats

21

should have propeller guards, or all boats should have

22

this kind of propeller guard.

23

The kind of multifarious context here suggests

24

exactly what common law adjudication was intended to

serve, and that is quite fact-specific adjudications when

2

is identical to a regulation promulgated by the Coast

Guard, and the scheme of this is obvious.

4

The Coast Guard is supposed to promulgate the

rules that tell manufacturers

what they have to do in

order to build a boat, a recreational boat in interstate

7

commerce, and the States can enforce -- if the State law

8

is identical to it, the States can participate in the

9

enforcement.

So if a boat is built out of compliance with

10

Federal design requirements, there can be a State law

11

remedy, but the States can't add to the requirement.
So that they -- so that here, for example, you

State law cuts the other way, I - MR. GELLER:

I don't think a fair reading of the

savings clause cuts the other way, Justice O'Connor, but
let's look at that as well.

This is on page 2 of the red

brief.
What it literally says -- what it literally says
is that compliance with a Federal regulation or order does
not relieve a person from liability at common law or under
State law, and the legislative history uses almost the
exact same language to describe what Congress was trying
to do here.
What Congress was trying to do here, quite
specifically, and it says it literally, is that in those
areas where State law still has a role to play, areas that
are not preempted, it is not a defense to that State law
claim that you've complied with the Federal regulation.
That's precisely what this says, and that's all
that this says.

It says nothing about preemption, and if

it were truly a savings clause intended to create a gaping
hole in section 4306, you'd think it would have been put
in section 4306.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. HUDSON:

In regard to the position of the

11

Coast Guard, I think in footnote 2 of the blue brief the

12

statement of the Commandant at the time the legislation

13

was enacted is pretty compelling.

14

Without any qualification, without any cramp

15

reading, the Commandant understood that the usual tort law

16

concerning negligence and warranties would survive the

17

enactment of this law.

18

quoted on page 6 of the blue brief by the executive

19

director of the Boatowners Association, who suggested a

need for a provision in the law to make it clear that

common law claims would survive.

QUESTION:

You consider that to be a position of

MR. HUDSON:

Further evidence of the agency's

position I think, Justice Scalia, is found in those 1971

and 1973 Federal Register provisions that are cited in all

of the briefs where the Coast Guard specifically left in

place all laws enacted by the States prior to 1971.

If they're

going to allow the State law enactments to stay in place,

surely the common law survives as well and, in fact, I

don't know that there's any rescission of those 1971

13

exemptions from preemption.

14

The claims we're making here, the Georgia

15

wrongful death statute is over 100
