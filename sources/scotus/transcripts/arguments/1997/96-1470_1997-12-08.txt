ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN R. SNYDER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SNYDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Members of Congress in
copyright law of

976 who enacted the

976 would be quite surprised to learn

3

from the Ninth Circuit's decision below that Congress

4

allegedly intended section 602 of that law to override the

5

longstanding and fundamental principle in copyright law

6

known as the first sale doctrine and thus to allow a

7

manufacturer to control the import and the subsequent

8

resale of particular copies of goods that the manufacturer

9

itself had already sold.

20

This Ninth Circuit decision is inconsistent not

21

only with the statutory language but also with the

22

legislative history and, indeed, Congress simply has not

23

addressed either in the copyright law or elsewhere

24

respondent's efforts to curtail parallel imports --

25

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Snyder, the Government has

come in and urged us to rely on the section that -- 602,

2

dealing with infringing importation of goods, and they

3

tell us that the United States has entered into treaties

4

on the assumption that that provision governs.

do with that argument made by the Government?

6

MR. SNYDER:

What do we

Justice O'Connor, I believe the

7

issue before the Court is what did Congress say and what

8

did Congress intend in a statute.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, I think so, but I would be very

10

interested to know how you evaluate the extent to which

11

this country has relied on some other interpretation, as

12

the Government argues.

3

MR. SNYDER:

I believe that the Government has

4

shown that in several bilateral trade agreements that were

5

never submitted to Congress either for consideration or

6

for action, the Government has asserted the position in

7

dealing with the Governments of Cambodia, Trinidad and

8

Tobago, and several other countries, that it is the

9

executive branch's position that parallel imports of the

20

2

kind at issue here should be curtailed.
We believe that, to the extent the Government is

22

relying on copyright law for that position, that it is up

23

to Congress to pass the law and set the policy, and it is

24

up to this Court to interpret that position of Congress

25

and what Congress said and meant.

QUESTION:

1

2

Do we owe deference to any Government

agency in interpreting these laws before us?

3

MR. SNYDER:

I believe not, Justice O'Connor.

4

This is not a case where the Government has even alleged

5

Chevron deference.

6

Government has been assigned by Congress any duty under

7

602(a).

8

the Copyright Office or any other agency of the executive

9

branch to administer 602(a).

This is not a case where the

There are no regulations.

There is no role for

It is solely a private right of action, and

10
11

under those circumstances we think there is no deference

12

to be accorded.

13

whatever position it wishes in bilateral negotiations, but

14

if their positions conflict with the position of Congress,

15

we submit they should go to Congress for a change in the

16

law.

17

The executive branch is free to take

QUESTION:

Let me ask you one more question,

18

since I have you interrupted, and then I'll leave it

19

alone.

20

Section 501, dealing with infringement of

21

copyright, says anyone who violates any of the exclusive

22

rights of the copyright owner covered by sections 106

23

through 118, or who imports copies into the United States

24

in violation of section 602, is an infringer.

25

Under your theory, that section wouldn't be

2

needed, I suppose, insofar as it refers to section 602.
MR. SNYDER:

I think it's correct that that

3

particular language could have been omitted.

4

would have raised questions where, in -- for courts to

5

interpret the language, since section 106 obviously deals

6

with distribution to the extent we're discussing it here,

7

and we all agree that importation is not literally the

8

same thing as distribution, Congress chose to make

9

importation part of the distribution right.

10

However, it

Had section 501 not specifically referred to

11

importation, someone could have argued that the reference

12

there to distribution or to section 106 didn't necessarily

13

cover things that were actually dealt with in 602 but not

14

literally in 106.

15

Congress appropriately tried to be sure that their

16

intention was crystal clear.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Snyder, I --

18

QUESTION:

Of course, one of the things they --

19

just on this point.

20

I think it was a situation where

One of the things they wanted to make sure of,

21

perhaps, is that 602 was kept intact as an independent

22

provision, because 602 says, under their reading, that it

23

is an independent act of infringement to import without

24

the consent.

25

MR. SNYDER:

Well, it is an act of infringement.

1

However, I think it's not totally independent in the sense

2

that the language of 602 specifically made importation a

3

violation of the distribution right under 106, so as we

4

interpret the language, Congress was saying that we wish

5

to make importation a separate type of violation of the

6

distribution right.

7

QUESTION:

But Mr. Snyder, if you're right about

8

that, wouldn't it have been more logical to say, in the

9

first part of 501(a), exclusive rights, section 106

10

through, including the right, the 602 right, instead of

11

making it conjunctive, as -- instead of making it

12

separate?

13

Your argument would fit very well if Congress

14

had said 602 belongs with 106A, but it makes it separate,

15

and in that light, going back to Justice O'Connor's point

16

about the representations this Nation has made, the

17

Government isn't making them in the air.

18

this 501(a), and if that's a plausible reading, even if we

19

don't owe Chevron deference, don't we owe some -- don't we

20

give some weight to the representations our Government has

21

made to other Governments?

22

MR. SNYDER:

It does point to

Well, first of all, Justice

23

Ginsburg, 501 obviously is not the section that

24

specifically was dealing with either the distribution

25

right or the importation issue, and I think to determine

1

Congress' intent, the first place that I would urge the

2

Court to look would be the statutes directly on point,

3

including 109, but I take your point that it could have

4

been phrased in a different way.
However, I would suggest respectfully to the

5
6

Court that by referring in 602 to the rights under 106,

7

Congress was doing something that really made quite a bit

8

of sense, and that is that all of the panoply of

9

conditions and exceptions to distribution rights that are

10

contained within 106 and its cross-referenced sections

11

thereby were applied here.
Section 106 begins by saying, subject to

12

13

sections 107 through 120, quote-unquote, there will be

14

certain exclusive rights, including the distribution

15

right.

16

use doctrine, which is a quite fundamental element of

17

American copyright law.

18

Those exceptions include such things as the fair

By making 602 a part of the 106 right and cross-

19

referencing it the way Congress did, it included the fair

20

use doctrine, the first sale doctrine, the other

21

exceptions, into the importation rules just as they're in

22

all the other parts of the copyright law.

23

Section 501 simply provides for the enforcement

24

mechanism for all of the rights, and I would respectfully

25

suggest that, because it lists importation as an

1

additional word in 501, it really doesn't negate, I don't

2

believe, the intent of Congress in the operative sections.

3

And obviously one of the key operative sections

4

here is section 109, and 109, which is the current

5

codification of the first sale doctrine, which is a

6

doctrine that goes back well over 100 years in copyright

7

law, section 109 says that if someone is the owner of a

8

particular copy that was lawfully made under this title,

9

that that owner can sell or otherwise dispose of that

10
11

copy.
And we believe that that is about as broad

12

language as Congress could use and in fact follows a --

13

quite a lengthy history of broad language in the statutes,

14

the predecessor statutes, and in the legislative history,

15

all of which have made clear that Congress intended to say

16

that once a particular copy that's lawfully made under the

17

U.S. copyright law has been sold, the copyright owner's

18

rights cease, and that's the actual language in the

19

legislative history of the '76 act.

the U.S. copyright owner, as to that particular copy.

The rights cease, of

We think that the first sale doctrine, there is

22

nothing in the language of the statute that suggests that

23

the first sale doctrine was being overridden, or that

Congress intended to change it, there's nothing in the

legislative history where Congress was talking about

changing the first sale doctrine, and we think the more

2

natural reading of all of these sections together,

including section 501, the more natural reading, to try to

4

follow the congressional intent, not the policy arguments

5

that each side can make, not the positions that the

6

executive branch might wish to take as a matter of policy

or as a matter of bilateral negotiations, we think that

the fairer way to read the actual language of Congress is

the way we've set forth.

there is no financial liability, and we would respectfully

then if they wish to rely on copyright law or any other

congressional enactment, they should go to Congress.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Snyder, can I ask you another

4

question.

5

your position is correct, what is the function of the

6

three exceptions to the statute?

7

I haven't quite figured out the answer.

MR. SNYDER:

If

The 602 exceptions, Justice

8

Stevens, we believe apply on their terms to very limited

9

situations where people are importing or bringing property

10

in for personal use or for noncommercial use.

11

exceptions, library use, Government use, do not apply to

12

commercial distributions, and they apply generally to very

13

limited numbers.

QUESTION:

We think those

Why wouldn't those exceptions already

18

be protected by the first sale doctrine if it applied?

19

That's what I'm not quite clear.

20

MR. SNYDER:

Justice Stevens, they are not

21

because the language of the 602 exceptions is not limited

22

to copies that are lawfully made under this title.

23

In other words, one of the paradigm situations

24

that the copyright considerations were looking at was

25

where property is copyrighted under a foreign copyright,

and this happens very frequently.

situation, and it was discussed at length in the

3

deliberations leading up to the statute.

4

This is a quite common

If an author gives the British copyright to his

5

or her book to a British company, and the U.S. copyright

6

to his or her book to a U.S. copyright holder, the U.S.

7

copyright holder obviously wishes to avoid having the

8

unrelated British copyright holder ship 1,000 copies of

9

the book here because the U.S. copyright holder has no

10

control over the independent entity, has not been paid

11

anything for those copies, et cetera.

12

That was discussed in the deliberations leading

13

up to the statute, and the phrase in 109, lawfully made

14

under this title, we submit means copies that are made

15

under the U.S. copyright law or made with the

16

authorization of the U.S. copyright holder, whereas,

17

Justice Stevens, under 602, if I'm traveling in Britain,

18

and I pick up a copy of a British book that's been

19

British-copyrighted and I put it in my baggage, I can come

20

home with it.

That's correct.
But it would not be protected under

MR. SNYDER:

6

We agree with that, and we think

that is a very significant distinction between the two

statutes.
QUESTION:

9

Maybe I'll reveal my ignorance about

10

that.

I just want to be sure I understand.

In other

words,

if the author gave the British copyrights to a

12

separate company from the publisher, the American

publisher, the British company then sells to some person

in Britain, abroad, a bunch of copies, those are not

protected by the first sale doctrine?

who's also a licensee in Britain.

MR. SNYDER:

That's correct.

It's quite common

for property -QUESTION:

So British copies would not be

6

lawfully made under this title, within the meaning of 109,

7

in your view.

8

9

MR. SNYDER:

That is our understanding, and that

is exactly the parallel or analogue to what this Court

10

held in the K Mart case, which obviously arose under

11

customs laws and trademark law, but in K Mart the

12

Solicitor General then argued that the first sale doctrine

13

in the trademark law should protect a U.S. mark holder

14

from competition from a totally unrelated entity, such as

15

the kind we're talking about now, but should not protect

16

the U.S. mark holder if the U.S. mark holder is a parent

17

or a subsidiary of the foreign mark holder.

18

That was the position the Government took then,

19

and this Court was unanimous -- while it -- the Court

20

split on several other of the various alternative cases

21

dealt with in K Mart, the case 1 and the case 2A

22

situations that I've just referred to, the Court was

23

unanimous on that.

24
25

The position we are taking is exactly the same
under copyright law as this Court found Congress had

1

authorized under the trademark law, and we think it makes

2

good sense in terms of the interests that are at stake

3

and, most importantly, it follows the language of the

4

statute.

5

QUESTION:

Does the U.S. copyright holder have

6

to have specific authorization from the author to

7

manufacture abroad in order to avoid a violation of 602?

8

MR. SNYDER:

Well, we do not believe that 602

9

limits the question of where you manufacture, and there's

10

a BMG decision from the Ninth Circuit that we cite in our

11

brief that seems to say the opposite, but that decision's

12

been criticized by a number of other courts, including the

3

Ninth Circuit in a later case.

4

language of Congress makes anything turn specifically on

5

where you manufacture.

We don't think the

They all deal with, let's imagine a human being

3

who comes to the border.

4

the border got his book, for example, some way or other.

If the way he got that book was subject to the first sale

medium-sized is beside the point.

It's not the null set.

I think that's correct, Justice

Breyer.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SNYDER:

Is that right?
There could -- there are cases I

14

think where there could be some overlap between the 109

15

protection and 602, but there are a great number of cases

16

where there's not overlap.

There's one other language point that

the Government makes in addition to its 501 argument.

refers to the later provision, the one in the -- what is

includes the word, import, and the argument is, and when

importing and otherwise disposing.
MR. SNYDER:

21

It

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think

22

it's fair to say that this statute, as many other

23

congressional enactments, probably could have been phrased

24

in different ways, some of which would have made our job

25

easier.

1

But, for example, 106A, which we cite, is a

2

statute that specifically says that that provision is an

3

exception, is -- that the first sale doctrine, the other

4

exceptions don't apply to that one.

5

In other words, in 106A Congress made it very

6

clear they were enacting a provision that wasn't going to

7

include the exceptions in 106 that we've relied on, so you

8

know, we've made the assertion that if -- that Congress

9

knows how to make it clear that something is not subject

10
11

to the exceptions.

They did it in 106A.

I think you're correct, the Government is

12

correct that there are other ways that Congress could have

13

phrased several of these provisions that probably would

14

have made them a little bit clearer, but I don't think

15

there's anything in the sections that you just cited,

16

Justice Ginsburg, that's inconsistent with our position.

17

They simply made that section a little clearer than they

18

made 602 and 106.

19

I think it's undisputed by everyone that there

20

is no specific reference in the legislative history to the

21

interplay between 106 -- I'm sorry, between 602 and 109.

22

In other words, no Congress Member ever addressed how

23

these two should go together.

24
25

We believe that the best way to deal with that,
given the language that's in the statutes at issue here,

1

the most relevant statutes, 602 and 109, is to say

2

Congress just hasn't addressed the matter.

3

Congress obviously is free to address it, and

4

the Government can either submit the bilateral agreements

5

that it's negotiated to Congress for review, or it can go

6

in with a statute on parallel imports.

7

have been quite a number of proposed bills to curtail

parallel imports.

QUESTION:

There actually

What is your response to the

10

argument -- I recall it was part of the Ninth Circuit's

11

opinion -- that the predecessor of 602 was worded in a way

12

which would cover many of the examples you gave, and yet

13

they added the terms, acquired outside the United States,

14

so it seems that your arguments give very little weight or

15

significance to the changes between the two -- between the

16

predecessor statute and 602 as now written.

17

MR. SNYDER:

I think the predecessor statute

18

only applied to pirated goods, Justice Kennedy, and the

19

Government and the respondent have both made the -- have

20

both referred to the fact that the new statute in '76 was

21

clearly intended to cover more than just pirated goods,

22

but so-called lawfully made goods as well.

23

We agree with that, and that's exactly the case

24

that I referred to that's analogous to the K Mart

25

situation.

In other words, goods that are lawfully made

1

under foreign copyright laws but not under the U.S. law we

2

think are covered by 602, and the fact that 109 is limited

3

to lawfully made goods under this title we think draws the

4

line between goods made under U.S. copyright law and goods

5

made under foreign copyright law, and we've laid out in

6

our brief quite a number of situations where the new 602

7

does have meaning, because it applies, for example, in the

8

case where an unrelated foreign copyright holder has

9

produced the good, it applies to many other cases.

10

Basically, our position is that 109 applies in

11

the importation situation just as it applies to all other

12

aspects of the distribution right, and 109 limits the

13

distribution right to some extent, and we think the

14

importation rules in 602 have become part of the

15

distribution right, and 109 applies to those as well.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Well, to prevail, do we have to think

that importation is a form of distribution?

I do not believe it is

But Congress, we believe, intended to subsume

it meant by saying that an unauthorized importation is a

violation of the right under 106, that Congress was simply

declaring it to be a -- for legal purposes a form of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND H. GOETTSCH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9
10

MR. GOETTSCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

I think it's important at the outset to note

12

that we believe that the K Mart v. Cartier case is not

13

apposite to this case at all.

14

addressed section 526 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and under

15

section 526, a U.S. entity can record its U.S. trademark

16

with the Customs Service to prevent unauthorized

17

importation of goods, even those with a genuine trademark.

18

In that case, the Court

The protection, however, extends only to goods

19

of foreign manufacture, and the issue before the Court was

20

whether the Customs Service's regulations were based upon

21

a reasonable interpretation of that statute, and a

22

majority of the Court found the phrase, foreign

23

manufacture, to be ambiguous and then as a result found

24

that some of the regulations of the Customs Service were

25

reasonable.

But to the extent that the K Mart case dealt

1

2

with trademark law, it's important to remember that, as

3

this Court recognized in the Sony v. Universal Studios

4

case, the -- there's a difference between the scope and

5

scheme and purpose of the trademark law as opposed to the

6

copyright law, and the courts are not to take principles

7

or doctrines from trademark law and extend them to

8

copyright law.
QUESTION:

9

May I ask, since you've cited the

10

Sony case, which dealt in part with fair use, how, under

11

your reading of the statute, does the fair use doctrine

12

protect the importation of foreign-made goods?
MR. GOETTSCH:

13

Well, I think that in enacting

14

section 602(a) Congress made a decision that the

15

limitations under Chapter 1 of the Copyright Act, which

16

would include the fair use under section 107 as well as

17

the first sale defense under section 109(a), did not apply

18

to section 602 (a) .

19
20

QUESTION:

Oh, so your view is there is no fair

use defense in this -- for imported goods.
MR. GOETTSCH:

21

Yes, except to the extent that we

22

think that the three exceptions that Congress did set out

23

expressly to section 602(a) do have a fair use element to

24

them.

The answer to this question should be

Prior to

Mr. Goettsch, you don't question the

contention of petitioners that there is no need to give

9

any deference to the negotiation -- negotiating position

MR. GOETTSCH:

agree with that.

First of all, I think it's important to

Well, then you say that there is

some -- I thought you just said that we just pay attention

16

to the language used by Congress, but you're saying,

17

though, that that language should be interpreted through

18

the prism of the executive branch deference?

19

MR. GOETTSCH:

No, I'm not saying that.

What

20

I'm saying is that -- first of all, I don't think that the

21

Court needs to reach that issue to interpret this statute.

22

I think the statute is unambiguous on its face.

23

However, if the Court were to consider

24

legislative intent, since the Copyright Office was very

25

much involved in the writing of the 1976 Copyright Act,

then I would simply say that its interpretation of that

act corroborates --

QUESTION:

5

does it?

It has no duties under this section,

I mean, it doesn't administer this act.
MR. GOETTSCH:

No.

Unlike 602(b), where Customs

6

is required to prohibit or bar the import of piratical

7

copies, under section 602(a) it's up to the copyright

8

holder to enforce the bar to entry of unauthorized

9

importation.

10

QUESTION:

Well, on your interpretation of the

11

statute, actually, that it's sort of an import violation

12

rather than a distribution violation, it really ought to

13

be the Customs Service to whom we might defer rather than

14

the Copyright Office.

MR. GOETTSCH:

16

QUESTION:

Well, that could be.

The --

the Court needs to do, that the Copyright Office's role in

of intent, and its current interpretation corroborates the

legislative intent.

QUESTION:

6

Okay.

You don't -- you do not

contend that we owe them deference.

7

MR. GOETTSCH:

Not in that sense, just in the

8

sense that this is corroborative evidence of legislative

9

intent if the Court needs to reach that.
QUESTION:

10

Will you -- just concentrating on the

11

language for a minute, will you explain how you get out of

12

the box that the right that's been infringed is the

13

exclusive right to distribute copies under section 106, a

14

right which is otherwise qualified as a first sale

15

doctrine, fair use doctrine and others.

16

Why, if it's the right granted by 106, why isn't

17

that right qualified by the other provisions between 107

18

and 119?

19

I don't quite understand your answer to that.
MR. GOETTSCH:

Well, there are several reasons.

20

First of all, if section 109(a), the first sale defense,

21

applied to section 602(a), then the three exceptions that

Congress expressly identified --

by the first sale doctrine, how can you say it's more -- I

2

don't understand.

3

scopes, one for most infringement cases, and then a

broader right under 602(a), is that right?
MR. GOETTSCH:

You say the 106 right has two different

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GOETTSCH:

9

Well, section 106, subparagraph

Subject to 107 through 120, yes.
Right, but that gives the

copyright holder the right to control the exclusive

10

distribution of a copy, is not exhausted unless there is a

11

sale, and importation does not denote a sale, so the

12

distribution right under section 106 is complementary but

13

separate from the importation right under section 602(a).

14

QUESTION:

Well, but the importation right is

15

treated as though it were an infringing sale, and to be an

16

infringing sale, it has to get by all the things like the

17

fair use doctrine, the first sale doctrine, and so forth.

Maybe I just don't quite --

19

MR. GOETTSCH:

No, I don't think it is Justice

20

Stevens, I don't think it is treated as an infringing

sale.

Mr. Wallace, since it's obvious that

there is some ambiguity here, room for different views,

since the Government was taking this position in its

no doubt about how the statute should be read?

don't agree with, but we do not think that that is an

issue for this Court to decide or for us to opine on.
