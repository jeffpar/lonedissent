ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Polygraph evidence is opinion evidence about

11

credibility.

12

reliability of polygraph evidence and the burdens of

13

litigating about polygraph results, it has long been

14

banned from courtrooms in a majority of the States.

15

Based on inherent doubts about the

In 1991, the President adopted the same rule for

16

military courts martial.

17

from Congress, the President promulgated Rule 707, which

18

makes polygraph evidence per se inadmissible in military

19

courts martials.

20

Exercising delegated authority

That determination is constitutionally valid for

21

three main reasons.

First, the reliability of the

22

polygraph remains unproven.

23

not necessary to help the trier of fact perform its core

24

function of determining credibility of witnesses, and

25

third, the costs of litigating about the reliability of

QUESTION:

Would that have been the -- was that

the consequence of the Armed Forces Court of Appeals

5

opinion here that the validity of each individual

polygraph examination had to be tested in each case?

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that's correct, Mr. Chief

8

Justice.

9

Forces, then the Court of Appeal -- Military Appeals,

In 1987, the Court of Appeals for the Armed

10

determined that the per se rule against polygraph evidence

11

which had prevailed in the military should be dropped, and

12

that individual defendants should have the opportunity to

13

litigate about it in each case, and in 1991 the evident

14

response to that was to reinstate the per se rule that had

15

been prevalent in courts across the country as well as the

16

military courts.

17

QUESTION:

How is it handled in other

18

jurisdictions where there's no per se rule in effect?

19

it treated like any other bit of scientific evidence?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

It is not, Justice O'Connor.

In

21

the States, 27 States have per se rules; 22 States allow

22

23

a stipulation between the parties so that the parties have

MR. DREEBEN:

One State is.

MR. DREEBEN:

12

I think that that's fair.

Right.
-- far greater degree of

specificity than for other expert testimony.

13

Now, in the Federal system --

14

QUESTION:

Daubert, of course, is in the civil

15

context, but would you say that the petitioner's -- pardon

16

me, that the respondent's position here is consistent

17

generally with what we held in Daubert?
MR. DREEBEN:

18

I think the respondent's position

19

here is -- goes quite a bit further than Daubert.

20

Daubert, of course, is simply an interpretation of Federal

21

Rule of Evidence 702.

22

that the Constitution prohibits any promulgator of a

23

system of evidentiary rules from establishing a per se

24

rule.

25

QUESTION:

The respondent's position here is

talking about the thrust of the case and what it held,

which was to undercut the Frye-type rule which is really

being applied by the military here.

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

That is --

I recognize one's civil, one's

6

criminal, one's constitutional, one's evidence, but so far

7

as the thrust of what the Court was talking about so far

8

as sound management of trials, isn't there some

inconsistency with your position in Daubert?
MR. DREEBEN:

10

I don't think there is any

inconsistency.

13

community as a prerequisite for scientific evidence to be

14

The point of Daubert was to drop the

Daubert did not do away with the rest of the

16

evidentiary considerations that may bear on whether

17

particular evidence may be admitted.

18

those are the requirement in Rule 702 itself that evidence

19

in the form of expert testimony must assist the trier of

20

fact, and furthermore that it's benefits, its probative

21

value must not be significantly outweighed by the waste of

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, when the Government

7

itself is responsible for the polygraph, and the

8

Government is attacking the credibility of the defendant,

9

isn't that a different situation?

10

This doesn't have to be all or nothing, but at

11

least as in this case, where the Government itself chose

12

to administer a polygraph test and in prosecuting attacked

13

the credibility of the defendant, when you have those two

14

things, why isn't that enough to trigger a constitutional

15

concern?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, the Government

17

might have had a particular defendant interviewed by a

18

psychiatrist if the defendant consented to that, and the

19

psychiatrist might say, based on my expert opinion and

20

analysis of this particular person's responses in the

21

interview, I can render an opinion that he was quite

certainly deceptive or not deceptive.

5

Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you this.

6

There's a brief filed by an amicus, a group of social

7

scientists who say that, if properly conducted, these

8

tests are accurate about

0 percent of the time.

Now, I don't know whether you would accept that,
10

or you would say that's probably wrong, but assume that's

correct, and if there are proper safeguards given and all

the rest, what would your position be?

percent accurate, would you still say, along the argument

14

you're making to Justice Ginsburg, this still should be

excluded?
MR. DREEBEN:

16

Yes.

Even if it was 100

I think, Justice Stevens,

17

that it has a drawback from the point of view of courtroom

assumption --

MR. DREEBEN:

Even if it had achieved that

2

degree of reliability, which I think there's no reason to

believe that it has, and there's no reason why the

President as a matter of constitutional law must assume,

it still has a different character --

6

QUESTION:

I understand.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

-- than other forms of scientific

8

evidence in two key respects.

The first is that it tells

the trier of fact something that we have traditionally

entrusted the trier of fact to determine itself, namely,

11

whether a particular witness should be believed.

Rules of evidence must be evenhanded, and the

reprinted in footnote 2 on page 5 of our principal brief,

practicable, apply principles of law and the rules of

The President could change that.

13

Justice Scalia, the President could certainly change it,

14

but I think it's important to emphasize here that the

15

Department of Justice in criminal trials in the civilian

16

courts takes the position that polygraph evidence should

17

not be offered by prosecutors even when it might arguably

18

be of assistance to us, and that it should be opposed when

19

presented by defense lawyers, and we do that precisely for

20

the same reasons that the President relied on in

promulgating Rule 707.

reliable than just any character witness the defendant

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think

11

that that assumes that there is scientific validity and

12

accuracy to the polygraph, which we dispute, but more

3

importantly, the system of rules of evidence that we have

4

in courtrooms specifically right now allows opinion

evidence and reputation evidence about a trait of

character of a witness, but it does not allow specific

MR. DREEBEN:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

As to credibility, and --

Right.

It's precisely the same issue

that the polygraph evidence is directed to, credibility.
MR. DREEBEN:

I think there's an important

5

distinction, Justice Stevens, and that is the polygraph

6

examiner will not render an opinion that I believe that

7

this person is generally credible.

8

9

He will render an opinion that says, based on
physiological responses that I observed, and all other

10

information that was available to me in whatever hour and

11

a half I had with this individual, I concluded that he did

12

not exhibit physiological signs of deception on this

13

particular instance, and that is akin to an expert

14

psychiatrist meeting with a defendant, interviewing him,

15

and coming away with the view that I think this man is

16

credible when he says that he didn't commit the act.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but there's a difference as to

18

the degree of reliability between the two, obviously,

19

and -- but your position as I understand it is, even if it

20

were totally reliable, you would still take the same

position it's inadmissible.

basically what you're saying.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

That's

I think all the Court has to do is

8

realize that this is an area of extraordinary scientific

polarization, and that a reasonable system of evidentiary

rules is entitled to deference in the conclusion that

that there is some deception, there is an effort to

13

determine what the truth is by further investigation,

14

further questioning of the applicant and so forth.

15

Generally, problems can get resolved that way, and it is

16

the entire body of evidence that is developed in a

17

background check that leads to a decision.

18

The polygraph itself is not supposed to be a

1

tool used in isolation, and it is distinguishable to say

20

that in a context where the Government is considering

21

whether to give access to an individual for national

22

security purposes to use anything available that might be

23

helpful in developing an accurate picture of an

individual.

MR. DREEBEN:

In investigations, the polygraph

I have to say that in that sense there are

examiners who believe that it is entirely reliable in this

respect, and that it's a great interrogation tool because

21

it's accurate.

22

well, it's a great placebo.

23

There are other people who will say that,

There is a story of a police interrogation in a

MR. DREEBEN:

The suspect confessed.

So if a suspect believes that the

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, it has a certain use in that

respect that would suggest that the Government continues

15

to use it, but at the same time, it's not arbitrary to say

16

that, look, not everything that we do in the investigatory

Are there instances in which an

MR. DREEBEN:

My understanding, Justice Kennedy,

is that in the -- certain national security agencies if

able to work at that agency.

4

And Congress, of course, which has addressed

5

extensively the problem of polygraph reliability, has

6

banned most of its uses entirely in the private sector in

7

large part because of concerns about its reliability, so

8

the President, when considering whether military courts

9

martials ought to be a forum for the admission of

10

polygraph evidence, is entitled to take into account the

11

findings of Congress in enacting the Polygraph Protection

12

Act, the fact that 27 States enjoy a per se rule that bars

3

polygraph evidence, and the fact that until this Court

4

decided Daubert, the uniform rule in the Federal courts,

5

with the exception of the Eleventh Circuit in

6

that polygraph evidence is per se inadmissible.

7

And even after Daubert has been decided, and

8

several Federal courts have reconsidered whether it is

9

appropriate to have a per se rule and have opted some

20

being admitted in criminal trials in the civilian courts,

3

I think that the President is certainly in a

4

position to take all of that into account and to conclude

5

that the military courts, of all places, should not be a

6

place where experimentation with new evidence is to be

7

carried out.

8

9

If there ever came a time when experience in the
civilian courts revealed that the polygraph was a vital

10

engine for getting out the truth, and that it ought to be

11

part of our criminal trial process, I'm quite sure that

12

the President or an appropriate rulemaking authority would

13

recommend reconsideration of Rule 707.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, why doesn't it work the

15

other way with respect to the military courts, because my

16

understanding is that the courts martial, the equivalent

17

to the jurors, are of a certain high level, perhaps higher

18

than the ordinary jury that would sit in a Federal court

19

in a criminal case.
MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, I wouldn't want

to disparage the ability of the courts martial members to

These proceedings in which, under Daubert,

litigants have attempted to admit polygraph evidence

usually involve extensive evidentiary hearings back and

MR. DREEBEN:

The triers of fact may or may not

What does distinguish polygraph evidence, again,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIM L. SHEFFIELD

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MS. SHEFFIELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Airman Scheffer's polygraph examination was one

6

7

of 34,788 polygraph examinations conducted by the

8

Department of Defense in fiscal year 1992.

9

Department of Defense personnel rely on polygraph results

Although

10

in matters of national security, Military Rule of Evidence

11

707 automatically predetermines, without any evidentiary

12

hearing whatsoever, that the results of Airman Scheffer's

13

examination were both unreliable and a waste of the

14

court's time.
Despite the fact that polygraph examinations are

15
16

used in the ordinary course of government business, the

17

rule further predetermined that the military officers who

18

sat in Airman Scheffer's panel were incapable of properly

19

using or evaluating these results, even with proper

20

cautionary instructions from the military judge.
QUESTION:

21

Those -- those other uses you're

referring to, I mean they are very common.

And --

-- and -- and if there is a

they will probably make a proffer, under the residual

Okay.

The other case -- in

theory that the right to present one's own testimony

2

extended at least as far as a right to present testimony

3

of others.

4

I see nothing constitutionally in Rock that

5

would say it could not apply with equal force to someone

6

other than the defendant's testimony.

7

QUESTION:

Well, that -- you -- you're entitled,

8

certainly, to take an expansive view of Rock.

9

you should remember it was a 5 to 4 decision.

10

MS. SHEFFIELD:

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

But I think

Yes, Your Honor.

Really, the -- the -- the key

13

difference between -- between all of these -- all of these

was inquiring into.

You wouldn't need juries.

2

3

MS. SHEFFIELD:

Well, Your Honor, to me, the --

4

the most perplexing argument is this idea that the jury

5

can determine credibility and the polygraph usurps their

6

function.

7

piece of the puzzle.

8

balance things all the time and weigh competing interests

9

to make important decisions.

It is one tool they use.

QUESTION:

10

It is simply one

And military juries especially, they

I thought that the argument that

11

Mr. Dreeben was making was not that it usurps the jury's

12

function, but that it's unnecessary, since juries, from

3

time immemorial, have been judging questions of

4

credibility.

5

it's unnecessary and it's very costly.

6

I thought his argument was, on that branch,

MS. SHEFFIELD:

Well -- well, Your Honor, we --

7

we submit that it's not unnecessary.

jury.

MS. SHEFFIELD:

Not as to the truthfulness, Your

14

and then will bring in experts, who talk about child abuse

that an innocent person is telling the truth.

Ms. Sheffield, a moment ago, you

1

MS. SHEFFIELD:

Well, Your Honor, that came from

a study -- a survey that was conducted by Dr. Licken --

Basically, they -- they -- obviously, it is
There's no doubt about that.

Dr. Raskin and Dr. Honts and some other
scientists talk about this study that the government
relies on, and says less than one-third said that.
But there were some problems with the survey

12

that they point out.

13

it was a random sampling, the context that the survey was

results from that.

20

by Gallup in 1982, I believe, and -- and another survey

21

almost a vitriolic critic of polygraph evidence.

So there's -- again, it's a polarized thing and
there's viewpoints on either side.

5

QUESTION:

Ms. Sheffield, if -- if we agree that

6

polygraphs have to be used in the -- as -- that the

7

Constitution requires polygraphs to be used in military

8

trials, I suppose it would follow that -- that they have

to be used in civilian criminal trials.

I mean, we -- we

couldn't have one rule for the milit -- one constitutional

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

The fundamental unreliability of polygraph

evidence is underscored not only for the reasons that

Justice Breyer adverted to, but also because of the

possibility that countermeasures can defeat any test.
