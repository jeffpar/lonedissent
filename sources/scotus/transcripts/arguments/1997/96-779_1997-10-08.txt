ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. MARKS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MARKS:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The issue in this case is whether the State of

11
12

Arkansas may establish the Arkansas Educational Television

13

Network as an institution of the press, insulated by

14

policy, structure, and tradition from State political

15

pressure.

16

The issue is important to viewers across the

17

country who depend on public television to select and

18

deliver information, particularly so in political

19

elections but, of course, at other times, too, and this

20

case does not extend just to political debates, because if

21

the decision below stands, its rationale will not only

22

result in fewer debates and less coverage of politics, but

23

it will extend to other programs of a controversial nature

24

where the trustworthiness of public television editors

25

will be questioned because they are employees of the

State.
QUESTION:

2

Well,

I think not necessarily.

It

3

all depends on the analysis that we follow, and you have

4

to ask whether this is closer to a situation of the State

5

speaking, as such, or a situation of letting candidates

6

speak.
I mean,

7
8

it may fall on one or the other side of

the line.
MR. MARKS:

Your Honor,

I agree that the

10

rationale that the Court uses will, of course, affect the

11

scope of the decision, but I think that it's clear from

12

the record whether we deal with a public forum doctrine

13

rationale or whether we deal with a structural rationale

14

based on League of Women Voters.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

No, and did the station set in

when there was a third candidate?

decided to have the debate, as I understand it,

said we're going to let the candidates for this office

2

come here and have a debate.
MR. MARKS:

3

Not exactly, Your Honor.

In fact, I

4

think that that is not a full enough characterization of

5

the record.
What the State decided here was to hold a

6

7

debate that would best serve the interests of its viewers,

8

and the record reflects that the editors went through an

9

elaborate analysis.

Ms. Oliver did an elaborate

10

investigation and reported to Ms. Howarth, the editor-in-

11

chief of the Arkansas network, about those candidates who

12

were newsworthy, and it is --

13

QUESTION:

I thought that occurred after this

14

third party candidate appeared and said, I want to talk,

15

too.

16

MR. MARKS:

No, Your Honor.

In fact, when the

17

debate discussion started, which was sometime in the

18

spring of 1992, there was a discussion, and it's reflected

19

in the testimony that we had at trial, about how the

20

debates would be structured and about their rationale, and

21

the purpose from the beginning was to provide the citizens

22

of Arkansas with a - - an opportunity to hear the views of

23

those candidates who were going to be the ones they were

24

going to be voting for, who had, in the words of the

25

witnesses, a serious chance, who were demonstrating

popular support by virtue of any number of factors.

2

Now, certainly --

3

QUESTION:

Well, I thought that was what emerged

4

eventually in response to the request of Mr. Forbes to

5

participate, but was that laid out in all its complexity

6

at the outset?

7

MR. MARKS:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MARKS:

Not in all its -No.
-- complexity, no, Your Honor, but

10

what -- but the early discussions between Amy Oliver and

11

Bill Simmons, the chief of the Associated Press in

12

Arkansas, concentrated on whom to invite.

13

Now, when they issued the invitations the only

14

candidates who were on the list to be invited were ballot-

15

qualified candidates, and they were in each district the

16

Republican and the Democratic candidates, so when the

17

original decision was made, the only candidates who could

18

be invited were the major party candidates.

19

Mr. Forbes qualified on August 17 of 1992, and

20

his letter was August 24, but even before that, Your

21

Honor, the policies that AETN has adopted, the policy on

22

editorial integrity, the programming policy which

23

incorporates the principles of editorial integrity, set

24

out for Ms. Howarth what would be her basis for decision.

Well, I assume that this decision was

parallel to what a private network would do with a similar

2

debate in a similar format.

3

I just judicially know that, or is that important for the

4

case, or - -

MR. MARKS:

Is that in the record, or do

Your Honor, I think that there are

6

enough cases -- the Chisolm case, the Henry Geller

7

decision at the FCC -- so that in fact from those cases

8

the Court can take judicial notice that this is a typical

structure for debates.

that, can he not?

MR. MARKS:

A private broadcaster can.
But is -- do you think a public

broadcaster - MR. MARKS:

I think this public broadcaster

16

under these policies, the principles of editorial

17

integrity and AETN's programming policy, this public

18

broadcaster could not do that and stay within the bounds

1

of the policy --

20

QUESTION:

Well, I would be interested in

21

hearing you answer Justice Scalia's question, which you

22

haven't done yet.

23

If the station wished to endorse a candidate,

24

could it have done so under the Constitution, without

25

regard to any statutory provision?

MR. MARKS:

1

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the

2

answer to Justice Scalia's question would depend on

3

whether that would be considered invidious discrimination,

4

and I don't think there's any precedent on it, but my

5

belief is that it would be.

QUESTION:

MR. MARKS:

8

Under the -- some equal -Sure, under an equal protection

theory.

QUESTION:

-- protection doctrine, or the First

11

QUESTION:

That they couldn't do it?

12

MR. MARKS:

10

Amendment?

Could not.

Could not, because I

13

think that the -- I think, Justice Scalia, that there are

14

limits on what a State-owned broadcaster can do. I think

15

those bounds are set by invidious discrimination --

16

QUESTION:

Well, to tie that in to where we were

17

before I asked the question, the mere fact that you're

18

using standards that a private broadcaster would use, and

19

that you're doing nothing more than what a, you know, a

20

private station would do, you're not behaving in a

21

politically biased manner, you're just behaving like a

22

good broadcaster, that doesn't help your case, because

23

there are some things that private broadcasters can do

24

that you can't do, and maybe this is one of them.

25

I think, Your Honor, that there's a

great difference between endorsing a candidate and having

the State come down that way.

4

QUESTION:

I think it's an equal

Well, I think that -- I'm not sure

5

about that, but can your answer be, and could we look at

6

this case as saying that we look at different programs to

7

determine what the First Amendment rules are, and we look

8

on a program by program basis, or do the same rules have

9

to apply to every part of the station's ownership,

10

management, and control in broadcasting, i.e.,

11

hypothetical about endorsement, hypothetical whether you

12

can hire all Democrats or all Republicans for the

13

editorial board and so forth?

We look at the precise function that's in

question, i.e., the conduct of debate.

that be an adequate -- is there adequate precedent for us

18

to decide this case on that sort of analysis?

The answer to the second question is

20

yes, and the answer to the first question is yes.

21

one of these situations, each one of these questions about

whether a particular program satisfies this Court's

precedent, is a two-level analysis.

within the bounds of these policies, and Justice Scalia,

2

these policies do bound her in a way that a private

broadcaster is not bound, because they require her to

consider credibility and fairness and balance and accuracy

and objectivity, and a private broadcaster is not bound

that way.

9

QUESTION:

Don't you think private broadcasters

might think those elements were desirable, or - MR. MARKS:

I think most broadcasters would find

10

them desirable and, indeed, Mr. Chief Justice, the intent

11

of adopting the principles of editorial integrity was to

12

allow the public broadcaster to walk this very difficult

13

line of needing to satisfy the requirements of the First

14

Amendment as the foundation requirement, but at the same

15

time being able to satisfy the requirement in the

16

Communications Act that it control all its programming,

because they're --

1

Well, Your Honor, in this case -- I

2

understand that the question is a, if I understand it

3

correctly, a polar question for analytical purposes, but

4

this case has a record, and there are distinct policies

5

here, and there is elaborate testimony -QUESTION:

6

Yes, but on the record in this case,

7

could they -- just to take the other side of Justice

8

Scalia's question, could they announce that we don't want

you to vote for Forbes?

boundary for a State-owned broadcaster in that area.
QUESTION:

Is it an invidious discrimination for

22

State-owned agents to say, we just think this guy is off

23

the wall, we don't think you should waste your time with

him, and if all that is true, it's invidious

discrimination?

they?

17

MR. MARKS:

That's right, Your Honor.

What Ms.

18

Howarth is obligated to do is to apply the principles of

19

mainstream journalism and, under those principles, she

20

made a decision based on newsworthiness.

21

Now, it seems to me that --

22

QUESTION:

Isn't that simply a way of saying

23

that the distinctly minority candidate always loses?

24

Because I presume newsworthiness is a measure of the

25

interest of the public in the candidate, and if the

1

judgment is made by the station that this candidate is a

2

loser, is never going to garner anything but a small

3

minority, and therefore is not newsworthy, then the

4

minority candidate always loses, and why isn't that a

5

pretty darned good surrogate for viewpoint discrimination?

6

The viewpoint is unpopular.

7

MR. MARKS:

There are two reasons, Justice

8

Souter.

First, as Mr. Perot's experiences in 1992 and

9

1996 illustrate, there can be a different conclusion based

10

on newsworthiness, and the distinctly minority candidate

11

does not always lose.
QUESTION:

12

Isn't it true that you put both

13

party, major party candidates on even though one has a

14

tiny percent and so is not of much interest to the public?

15

MR. MARKS:

Yes, Your Honor, and the reason, as

16

reflected in the record in the testimony of Ms. Howarth

17

and Ms. Oliver, is that a major party nomination carries

18

with it a degree of public support that news people

19

usually don't ignore, and they didn't ignore in this case.

20

They felt it was --

21

QUESTION:

May I return to Justice O'Connor's

22

question about what these standards of newsworthiness

23

were?

24

why isn't this like the legions of cases that have come up

25

with a Government official allowing, say, a permit for a

parade with no standards at all, and then after a request

2

is made, may be coming up with a set of reasons?
Generally in this area, hasn't the Court

3

required at least that there be clear standards written

I don't know about the League of

13

are, they are Government actors.

14

MR. MARKS:

Let's -- let me address that in

15

terms of Polk County.

16

State action here, but Ms. Howarth is not acting, in our

17

view, as we have said in our brief, under color of State

18

law.

19

This is essentially a private press function.

She's not

20

dependent on the State's coercive power here.

She's not

doing this out of loyalty to the State.

She is exercising independent professional judgment.

No, Your Honor.
Clearly she's a State actor in that

sense.
MR. MARKS:

6

If she crossed -- first of all, that

would be outside these policies that guide her, and in

response to Justice O'Connor's and Justice Ginsburg's

question, theses policies do provide some guidance.

It's

10

not as if the -- not as if she's out there on a chartless

sea.
QUESTION:

12

Well, I think the question is what's

13

permissible for a State actor, not whether or not she is

14

or is not a State actor.

MR. MARKS:

think as you phrased it the key word is selected

start was clear that she was not opening up this debate to

MR. MARKS:

1

That's exactly correct, Mr. Chief

2

Justice, and the key is whether Ms. Howarth intended to

3

open up the debate only to newsworthy candidates, or

whether she intended to allow the debate to be open on a

nonselective basis to anybody who was ballot - qualified.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Marks, maybe I misapprehend this,

7

so tell me if I do, but my notion of a nonpublic forum was

8

a closed circuit like the teachers in the school, like the

9

Federal employees who are being solicited, that that --

10

but this, whatever else it is, it is for the public.

11

debates are for the public, not for a group of

12

schoolteachers, not for a group of public employees, so I

13

was thinking that whatever it is, it isn't a nonpublic

14

forum.

15

MR. MARKS:

The

Ms. Howarth's contention is that it

16

is a nonpublic forum because it was Ms. Howarth's

17

intention in providing for participation she was not

18

opening it up to all ballot qualified candidates, but only

19

to those candidates that were newsworthy, and Mr. Forbes

20

was not newsworthy.

21

He was an ineffective candidate.

His efforts to fit a place in the market space

22

were feeble, he was not generating public support, and for

23

that reason Ms. Howarth concluded that his appearance

24

would not serve her audience, and for that reason it was

25

her position that he did not fit the criteria to be

MR. WALLACE:

When a governmental entity puts on a Law Day

forum analysis does not apply to the Government's own

I mean, why isn't that a public forum?
Of course a university or a station can have

6

programs and teach what it wants, but when they choose to

7

set a candidate's forum that's highly expressive and

8

communicative with the public, why isn't that different?

9

MR. WALLACE:

The mere fact that non-Government

Days

1

later, an unelected Government official summarily declared

2

him a frivolous candidate and banned him from its debate

3

for that very seat.

4

The Government therefore today asks this Court

5

to give it unfettered discretion to pick and choose

6

amongst candidates, and confer powerful Government

7

benefits on those it chooses, to the detriment of their

8

opponents.

QUESTION:

Mr. Shackelford, one of the

10

suggestions that's been raised is that if in fact the

State is limited in what it can do here, the State will be

12

limited in what it can do almost universally throughout

13

its broadcasting, including news broadcasts and so on.

That's one of the standards.

We

One standard is editorial discretion.

Well, but, you know, you're saying

that the public broadcasting stations could do this, and

about ballot access is it's respectful of the people's

I think when they begin to involve private

Mr. Shackelford, suppose the Court

were to determine that the standards that Ms -- whatever,

that those were all okay standards, the problem was that

she made them up, or came up with them after, and that

under those standards your candidate would flunk, so

election is long over, would you be entitled to any relief

if the standards that she announced are okay, the only

10

problem with them was that they weren't in place when your

11

candidate asked to be part of the debate?
MR. SHACKELFORD:

12

I think we would still be

entitled to relief.

Because, a good example was the

there's always an opportunity, if somebody doesn't want to

there's always opportunity to manipulate those factors.
