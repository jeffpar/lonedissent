CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. IEYOUB

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

GENERAL IEYOUB:

10
11

:08 a.m.)

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This is the Federal Election Day case up from

2

3

Louisiana.

4

Congress put the Federal Election Day statute on the books

5

in

6

Election Day statute nullifies Louisiana's open primary

7

system under which all registered voters, regardless of

8

party affiliation, vote for their candidates for Senate

9

and United States Representative.

As Your Honors know, the 42nd Reconstruction

The question presented is whether the Federal

Under Louisiana law as we know it since

976, if

2

a candidate receives a majority of the votes in the

22

October primary the candidate is declared elected, and

23

there's no contested election on Federal Election Day,

24

shall we say saving the poor working man a trip to the

25

polls in nonpresidential election years.

to your knowledge, have this system?

3
4

General Ieyoub, does any other State,

GENERAL IEYOUB:

Yes, Your Honor.

Oklahoma has

a similar system, as does Hawaii, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

And they each provide, as Louisiana

6

does, for an open primary and no general election if a

7

candidate gets a majority?

8

GENERAL IEYOUB:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, California has a system, I

10

believe, of allowing crossover voting in primary

11

elections, is that right?

12

GENERAL IEYOUB:

3

I'm not sure, Your Honor.

believe that's correct.

4

QUESTION:

And some States allow crossover

5

voting.

pick the party's candidate, but parties -- people who

7

belong to another political party may cross over and

8

vote --

In other words, there's a primary election to

QUESTION:

GENERAL IEYOUB:

-- in the party primary.
Yes, Your Honor.

But in effect Louisiana and you say

23

several other States don't treat the primary election as a

24

party primary.

25

GENERAL IEYOUB:

No, Your Honor, it does not.

Everyone has a right to vote in the open primary in

2

October, regardless of party affiliation.

3

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.

4

GENERAL IEYOUB:

And all candidates run in the

5

primary regardless of the party affiliation, so that if

6

there is not a majority vote, then the two top vote-

7

getters go into -QUESTION:

10

that change?

And why is it that Louisiana made

I guess it was not always that way.

It

wasn't until the late seventies.
GENERAL IEYOUB:

11

That's correct, Your Honor.

I

12

do not know why they made that change, Your Honor, but the

13

change was made in 1976, and it actually went into effect

14

in 1978, and since 1978, Your Honor, we have proceeded

15

under the open primary law manner of election.
QUESTION:

16

Well, you -- do you concede that

17

Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact

18

laws affecting the timing of election of Members of the

19

Congress?

20

GENERAL IEYOUB:

Yes, Your Honor.

Congress may

21

at any time alter regulations as it see fits, but I would

22

point out that in 20 years, almost 20 years of the open

23

primary, Congress has never moved to try to alter

24

Louisiana's manner of electing its representatives to

25

Congress so as to force a determinative election on

Federal Election Day, and Your Honors, the -QUESTION:

2

Well, I guess the question, really,

3

is whether the statutes that Congress did pass are

4

contrary to Louisiana's scheme, as was held in the court

5

below.

6

GENERAL IEYOUB:

No, Your Honor, I would argue

7

that it is not.

8

Congressman Butler and Senator Thurman in 1872, primaries

9

were unknown.

At the time the statute was passed by

They did not foresee primaries.

Primaries

10

were a creature of the 20th Century, as fully stated in

11

this Court's decision in United States v. Classic,

12

they did have the foresight to make exceptions for death

13

or failure to elect, in which case they allowed elections

14

other than on Federal Election Day.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

but

Well, do you say that Louisiana's

system creates a vacancy, so the vacancy statute applies?
GENERAL IEYOUB:

Louisiana's system certainly

18

allows for the election of a candidate in October, as

19

opposed to actually electing on Federal Election Day.

20

QUESTION:

Well, except the Federal statute

21

fixes the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November

22

as the day for election for the Members of Congress.

23

GENERAL IEYOUB:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

24

Louisiana's statutory scheme does, in fact, set a date on

25

the first Tuesday after the first Monday.

It does do

that.

QUESTION:

2

3

We simply -But the election, if there's a

majority vote in the primary, does not occur on that date

4

GENERAL IEYOUB:

Well, that's correct, Your

5

Honor, and I submit that what we have here is an old

6

statute and new circumstances, in which case I think that

7

we have to look to the legislative purpose and the

8

legislative history, as Chief Justice Taney said, looking

9

if necessary, to the public history of the times in which

10

the statute was passed, and Justice Holmes saying you can

11

look to the respective minds of Congress.
QUESTION:

12

So you accept the proposition that

13

Louisiana law de jure authorizes elections before the

14

Federal election date?
GENERAL IEYOUB:

15

That is correct, Your Honor, a

16

person can be elected de jure under Louisiana's scheme,

17

but what we're saying here is that Thurman and Butler

18

wanted to protect the right to choose, and that is

19

protected by Louisiana's statutory scheme.

20

What was important, what is important is, as

21

Hamilton said, the right of the people to choose those

22

whom they -- who will govern them, and we allow that.

Louisiana's statutory scheme allows that.

allowed, and I know that it's called an open primary, but

2

would you explain to me why that isn't a misnomer?

3

As you've said, everyone can vote.

That's the

4

time everyone votes.

5

in order to be in the running you must participate.

It's not like a party primary, and

GENERAL IEYOUB:

Everyone who wants to run
Why doesn't that add up to an

Well, Your Honor, there is an

election on October -- in October.

12

QUESTION:

So then that is the Election Day.

13

GENERAL IEYOUB:

That is the election primary

14

date, Your Honor, and if a person receives a majority of

15

the vote, and only in that instance, they are declared

16

elected, and there would be no determinative election on

17

Federal Election Day.
QUESTION:

18

Yes, but my question to you is, why

19

don't we just call it what it is, that is, an election,

20

since everybody votes, and everybody who wants to be in

individuals with the highest vote totals going into a

It is also a system of voting that winnows down

QUESTION:

But you could do that consistent with

6

the Federal day by having, if there are two people, then

7

you have a run-off, as can happen in some States.

8

GENERAL IEYOUB:

9

QUESTION:

10

That's correct, Your Honor.

Later on, before January.

GENERAL IEYOUB:

That's correct, and that is

11

possible, but the State legislature of Louisiana, which we

12

contend has the primary authority to set the manner of

13

elections, has acted in such a way as to hold this scheme,

14

the open primary scheme, as the law of our State.

15

If we look at the hist --

16

QUESTION:

But what interest of Louisiana would

17

be affected if Louisiana said, we're going to do our same

18

thing, except we're going to do it on Federal Election Day

19

and, if need be, in the 20 percent of the cases, we'll

20

have a run-off.

21

with all of the State goals, and with the Federal law.

22

Then you would be acting consistently

GENERAL IEYOUB:

Louisiana could do that, Your

23

Honor, but what we're saying here is that Louisiana's open

24

primary scheme in no way really clashes or conflicts with

25

the Federal Election Day statute.

2

There is no constitutional authority

3

on the part of Congress to determine the time, uniformly

4

throughout the country?
GENERAL IEYOUB:

5

There is, Your Honor, but as

6

was pointed out by Mr. Madison in his answer to Mr.

7

Monroe's question about the Times, Places, and Manner

8

Clause, the States should have the primary responsibility.

9

The reason why the Federal Government might have some

10

control is that they were afraid that if the Federal -- I

11

mean, if the State legislatures did not act appropriately,

12

it could bring about the dissolution of the Union, and

13

that's what --

14

QUESTION:

Is it us -- is it up to this Court to

15

decide whether Louisiana has acted appropriately in

16

determining whether a pretty clear Federal statute is

17

going to be applied or not?

18

to do?

19

GENERAL IEYOUB:

Is that what you're asking us

No, Your Honor.

I am -- I

20

think that Congress has a right to decide whether or not

21

there is a determinative election on Federal Election Day.

it's a justiciable controversy, because I fail to see the

QUESTION:

But I want to make sure I understand

7

your position.

Your position, then, is not really an

8

argument about whether the statute applies, and if so,

9

how, and whether there is an inconsistency between it and

10

the Louisiana statute.

11

really does not belong in the court.
GENERAL IEYOUB:

Your position is that this issue

Yes, Your Honor, that is my

It does not belong in the court.
The right of an individual to vote in any manner

4
5

is not absolute, and this Court so stated in Burdick v.

6

DeCoushy, that the manner of voting is not necessarily an

7

absolute right.

8

Now, if Your Honors would look at the appendix,

9

joint appendix on page 43, one of the respondents says, I

20

did not vote in the October open primary in which Billy

2

Tauzin received a majority of the vote and was thereby

22

elected outright under Louisiana law.

prevented by the Louisiana law from exercising my right

election.

She did not vote in the primary, and now she's

2

saying that since I did not vote in the manner in which

3

Louisiana prescribed, I have been deprived, and I have

4

been injured, and Your Honor, we say that will not do.

5

That is just not correct, and the matter should not be in

6

this Court.

7

QUESTION:

Then your view is that no voter, as

8

long as they could vote in something they called a

9

primary, would have standing to object to Louisiana's

10

deviating from most of the country in having what is the

11

election a month before everyone else does.

12

GENERAL IEYOUB:

Well, Your Honor, I would say

3

that certainly there would -- in our situation, where

4

there is an open primary and an October election, when one

5

fails to vote they have not really suffered an injury to

the extent that this Court, or to the extent it would

create a justiciable controversy in which this Court --

QUESTION:

If you -- General Ieyoub, that's how

you -- if you fail to vote you have no standing, and if

20

you vote you haven't been injured, I suppose, so the

result would be that no individual voter could ever

22

challenge the violation, or claim violation of the

23

congressional statute.

QUESTION:

Indeed, most of the time it's

resolved in the primary, as I understand it.
GENERAL IEYOUB:

The history has been, Your

8

Honor, that in the past most of the time they have been

9

elected during the primary, and I will point out that

20

under Article I, section 5, the Congress has the authority

21

to challenge the seating of any individual elected to

22

Congress and after 20 years Congress has never moved to

23

remove the credentials of any Louisiana Senator or

24

Congressman because they were elected in October as

25

opposed to November.

impractical to say that if a Congressman got over 50

percent of the vote in a primary, they're not qualified to

ballot, and if by happenstance the same person has been

17

chosen by the respective Democratic and Republican

18

primaries, the election is still held in -- the conclusive

19

election is held in November, and the primaries were not

20

legally -- were not the legal selection of the

21

congressional officer.

22

QUESTION:

They

And Louisiana has been candid in

23

describing its system, because it says, if you have

24

somebody who comes out of this race, whatever it is, with

25

a majority vote, that person is elected.

MR. BAKER:

Correct.

That's correct, Justice

2

Ginsburg, and section 8, the companion statute to section

3

7, 2 U.S.C. section 8, is a statute that answers this --

4

that gives us the answer in this case.

5

Elections in 1872 were like the elections that

6

Louisiana has today.

Everybody appeared at the polls.

7

Everybody voted.

8

sufficient to elect a person to Congress, but a number of

9

States have majority vote requirements as does Louisiana

In most States, a plurality election was

10

today, so therefore Congress inserted section 8 into title

11

2 to provide for the contingency of a failure to elect on

12

Federal Election Day, and that's the statute that

13

Louisiana could follow and have its post Federal Election

14

Day run-off if it so chose to do that.

16

If there are no further questions, that
concludes my argument.
