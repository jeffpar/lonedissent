CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Steel and Pickling Company, v. Citizens for a Better

Environment.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SANFORD M. STEIN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEIN:

10
11

12

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the 60-day notice period in

13

the citizens provision of the Emergency Planning and

14

Community Right to Know Act, and whether that period is

15

intended to operate as a cure, thereby obviating a

16

citizen's suit, or whether citizens may sue for wholly

17

past violations even after cure.

18

As found by this Court in Gwaltney v. Chesapeake

19

Bay Foundation, and again in Hallstrom v. Tillamook

20

County, the overriding congressional purpose of

21

environmental citizen provisions is to prompt compliance

22

with environmental laws.

23

last resort, when other methods have failed.

Litigation ought to be used as a

QUESTION:

7

They alleged no current or

Let me ask you a question, please, if

I may, Mr. Stein.
What if it were the EPA that were coming in

8

9

5 forms required, all

asking for penalties to be imposed after the fact of a

10

cure, so to speak, after the forms were actually filed,

11

but the EPA then comes in and says, well, they should have

12

been filed on X date and they weren't, and they've now

3

filed them, but we want a penalty for every day of the

4

nonfiling.

5

Under the statutory scheme, is that permissible?

6

MR. STEIN:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, under our

7

reading of the statute the EPA's enforcement policy comes

8

under section 325 of the statute, a wholly different

9

section than section 326, the citizen provision.

20

QUESTION:

Well, the citizen's suit provision I

21

suppose is designed to be a sort of private attorneys

22

general approach, and to let citizens pick up the slack if

23

the EPA doesn't do it, and is there any reason why the

24

citizens suit shouldn't have the same authority, then, to

25

come in and seek a penalty for the failure to file on

time?

2

MR. STEIN:

3

First of all,

Yes.

Several reasons,

as we see it.

section 326 is far more limited,

4

giving citizens a more limited enforcement and assistance

5

role than the EPA's authority under section 325.

6

citizen provision, a citizen may commence a suit upon the

7

failure to complete or submit the forms.
The Sixth Circuit,

8
9

in analyzing the same

language in the United Musical case,

found that it was the

10

failure that Congress was looking for.

11

far broader than that.
Also,

12

In the

EPA's authority is

section 326(c) of the statute specifically

13

points out that citizens are able to invoke the court's

14

jurisdiction in the evidence of an enforcement or an

15

injunctive remedy, and then at that time the court can

16

apply penalties if it has jurisdiction through 326,

17

section 326(c).
In that respect,

18

the citizen provision of EPCRA

19

is very similar to the citizen provision of the Clean

20

Water Act that this Court analyzed in Gwaltney.

21

Gwaltney,

22

Congress did not expect -- intend citizens to sue for

23

wholly past violations, but one of the most convincing was

24

section 505(a)

25

In

the Court found many reasons to find that

of the Clean Water Act.

There, also,

the Court found that before a

1

Citizen could invoke the court's jurisdiction it had --

2

there had to be some kind of injunctive or abatement

3

remedy that it was seeking and then, and only then, would

4

the Court be willing to address penalties relative to a

5

citizens' action.
Beyond that, and further answering, we think

6

7

that if -- even if the court below were somehow correct

8

that they can seek wholly past violations, we think it

9

fails the Article III standing test because on that date

10

any injury that would befall a citizen had been fully

11

cured.

12

QUESTION:

What about the attorneys fees and

3

costs that the claimant might have incurred in

4

investigating the claim and filing it?

5

MR. STEIN:

Justice Kennedy, the costs that they

6

incur investigating are also costs that they cannot

7

recover if the EPA comes in under the -- under EPCRA.

8

They are barred from suing if EPA comes in under the --

9

QUESTION:

They can recover those costs if the

20

violation is not cured after 60 days and the suit proceeds

21

and they prevail, can they --

22

23
24
25

MR. STEIN:

If they prevail, then they can

assert a likelihood for fees -QUESTION:

Well, but then it seems to me there

may be a -- you have a statutory argument.

I don't see

1

the Article III argument.
MR. STEIN:

2

I think the Court has ruled that

3

penalties alone have to -- do not give a party standing.

4

They have to be -- a standing has to accrue as an

5

underlying part of the plaintiff's claim and just

6

investigation costs and fees are a byproduct of the

7

litigation.

8

QUESTION:

9

is a case for that?
MR. STEIN:

10
11

And what is the proposition -- what

Diamond v. Charles.

Also, Lewis v.

Continental Bank.
QUESTION:

12

That was just whether or not there

3

was an interest in being a prevailing party per se.

4

not sure if it said that Congress couldn't create a cause

5

of action for attorneys fees or investigatory, preparatory

6

fees legitimately and in good faith incurred.

7

MR. STEIN:

I think there was language.

I'm

know if it said the Congress could not, but here I don't

think Congress did.

21
22

23

I mean, it was -- well, there's some

question.

Well, then it's not an Article III

It's just a statutory question.
MR. STEIN:

We believe the statutory question

24

here is far more important than -- and -- than the Court

25

could rule completely under the statute, because under the

1

plain language of that -- it is the completion and

2

submission of the forms, the failure of that action, that

3

gives rise to a citizen action, and that's what United

4

Musical found, that's what the district court found.

5

The -QUESTION:

6

So on your view, then, if the

7

compliance came after the 60-day period, let's say the

8

time sequence is 60-day period runs, suit is filed on day

9

70, the defendant comes into total compliance, files all

10

the back forms, the suit would be moot at that point, if I

11

follow your reasoning.
MR. STEIN:

12

Justice Ginsburg, at that point,

13

mootness principles would apply and the burden would shift

14

to the defendant to show why mootness would apply and why

15

there would be no likelihood of a recurring violation such

16

as to relieve the court of its jurisdiction.

17

But whereas mootness will lie after the

18

complaint is filed, if it is filed with Article III

19

authority for standing, mootness standing is the

20

plaintiff's burden.

21

the complaint being filed, and we don't believe that they

22

had standing in this case at the time the complaint was

23

filed.

2

If you say that -- even when suit will properly

before the defendant comes into compliance, you're saying

that suit will be washed out when the defendant complies.

MR. STEIN:

Not necess -Why would anybody file a suit?

Well,

first of all,

I

I think they may

10

file for any number of reasons.

11

Congress was interested in compliance, and interested in

12

citizen enforcement.

13

properly filed after the 60 days, because that's the limit

14

of the cure period -- the burden on the defendant at that

15

point is a heavy one to show that there's no further

16

likelihood of an intermittent or recurring violation,

17

there may be cases where it is mooted,

18

cases where it is not, but I believe Congress --

Why shouldn't we say that -- I guess

we don't have to decide that issue in this case, but why

21

couldn't the situation be that so long as you have not

22

filed before -- after the 60-day period and before suit is

23

filed against you, you are liable for the penalty that's

24

set forth in the civil provision.

25

your theory of this case?

Would that contradict

MR. STEIN:

If you're filed before the suit

2

was -- before the suit was filed, but after the 60 days, I

3

believe standing would not lie.

4

QUESTION:

If you file after suit, and after the

5

60 days, if you come into compliance with the law after

6

the suit is filed and after the 60-day period, why isn't

7

it reasonable to say that the Federal Government intended

8

to give these private attorney generals the right to the

9

penalties accruing?

10

MR. STEIN:

At that point the court would have

11

jurisdiction, Justice Scalia, and the court could apply

and determine --

QUESTION:

MR. STEIN:

You say it's mooted as soon as -Not necessarily.

No, I did not say

15

it was -- I don't mean to convey that it's mooted.

defendant at that point, and the defendant has a heavy

burden under --

1

MR. STEIN:

And the court determines that there

2

is reason for the court to retain jurisdiction, it is not

3

moot in the court's estimation because there is a

4

possibility of further violations, or that the allegedly

5

illegal conduct may continue.

6

QUESTION:

Assume no possibility of further

7

violations, it's your position that the plaintiff's

8

entitlement to the penalty alone wouldn't make any

9

difference?

10

MR. STEIN:

The court at that time, after a suit

11

is properly filed, would be able to assess whether its

12

jurisdiction -- whether the granting of penalties at that

13

point would have some continuing effect, or some

14

beneficial effect as to the defendant, but if it is mooted

15

the court would lose jurisdiction, I would agree, and

16

therefore the penalties would not apply.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Would the penalty ever go to anyone

other than the Government?
MR. STEIN:

Not at all, Justice Souter.

Under

20

section 325, the Government is the only party entitled to

21

receive the penalties.

22

QUESTION:

But even if there were mootness,

23

after the 60-day period ran as a result of compliance

24

there would still be entitlement to attorney's fees, would

25

there not, because the mootness didn't come about until

MR. STEIN:

If the court were to retain

the court could then address the question of anything

that it was the action of suit that brought the defendant

2

into compliance, he might be able to find that the

plaintiff citizen organization at that time was the

prevailing party or substantially prevailing party, as the

5

statute reads, and award fees.
QUESTION:

6

I think that would be a --

Well, from the standpoint of mootness

7

and Article III, the precise analysis would apply if the

8

violation were cured before the 60 days.
MR. STEIN:

9

If -- I disagree, because before the

10

60 days -- Congress gave a 60-day period to cure, and

11

Congress gave citizens the right to sue in the event --

12

going back to the statute, in the event cured -- in the

13

event there was a failure to comply.

14

that Congress gave citizens the opportunity to vindicate,

15

if it is vindicated either under the statute or under

16

Article III as we see it, but more strongly under the

17

statute, because we think you can decide this under the

18

statute.

19

QUESTION:

That is the right

Well, what if it is before the 60-

20

day period that the company files the reports, but the

21

plaintiff believes and is prepared to show that the

22

company is likely to be a repeat offender?

23

MR. STEIN:

Justice, in that situation it would

24

be similar to Gwaltney, where the was a possibility, a

25

likelihood of recurrence, and in that case the court could

don't tie that to any language of the statute.
MR. STEIN:

11

But you say that's possible, and you

I find it theoretically possible,

but only on reading the statute academically.
QUESTION:

12

Isn't the significant point there's

no such allegation in this case?

remember the complaint, that there's a likelihood you will

not comply.

They don't allege, if I

The complaint does not allege a

concern about future violations.
MR. STEIN:

It does not, Justice Stevens.

This

is a case about a wholly past violation, and that is the

point, and under EPCRA, which is an information-gathering

QUESTION:

11

Well, why -- no, I mean, there was

for 8 years no filing, and then it was called to their

13

attention.

14

for all the past years or only the most recent year?

15

So

By the way, when there was a filing, was it

MR. STEIN:

No, Justice Ginsburg, they filed all

16

15 forms that were due within the cure period and, as we

17

pointed out both parties rely on the GAO report, that many

18

small companies such as the Steel Company simply were not

19

aware of their requirements, otherwise dutifully compliant

20

with a host of complex environmental laws, and their

21

unawareness -- their nonfiling was an innocent

22

unawareness.

23

But upon being given this information, the

24

notice, they filed, and we think that's part of the intent

25

of Congress here.

two stages, first with a notice and cure period, and then,

2

and only then, if a party will not heed or cannot heed,

3

for whatever reason, and come into compliance, then

4

Congress gave citizens a very powerful weapon at the end

5

of that 60 days, which was the opportunity to invoke the

6

court's jurisdiction and seek penalties.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Stein, can I ask you, with regard

8

to attorneys fees and the like, they ask in their

9

complaint for all costs in connection with the

10

investigation and prosecution of this matter, including

11

fees, attorneys fees and expert witness fees.

12

Now, do you agree that the statute authorizes

13

the award of the investigation costs before suit was

14

filed, or when they were trying to make up their mind

15

whether to file suit?

16

MR. STEIN:

I believe, Justice Stevens, they're

17

entitled to those fees if they're a prevailing party, but

18

not if they are not -- if they can't bring suit because

19

the defendant cured in the cure period.

20

22

QUESTION:

I'm asking, if they are a prevailing

party, you agree they get the pre-suit investigation.
MR. STEIN:

The court would be able to look

into -- that would be a subject before the court if they

are a prevailing party in a citizens' suit, not if, as

QUESTION:

1

But the statute says under (f) that

2

the court may award costs of litigation.

That's what the

3

statute says, so I guess they are entitled to

4

investigatory costs only if those are part of the costs of

5

litigation.

Is that right?

I mean, what we're -- I mean, what I would

6

7

interpret the question to be is, is there something

8

special here by way of costs that are being awarded in

9

this case that are not normally present whenever a statute

10

provides a winning party with costs of litigation?
MR. STEIN:

11

And we believe not, Justice Breyer.

12

We believe this is a normal investigation cost that if the

13

EPA should step in barring them from a citizens' suit

14

within a 60-day period, they would not be entitled to

15

those costs.

16

prevailing or substantially prevailing party, and the

17

question is, is, if there is no suit, if cure occurs

18

during the first stage of the congressionally mandated

19

two-stage citizen action period, is that a cost of

20

litigation or is that a normal cost of their activities,

21

which are to assert their interest on behalf of their

22

members.

23

They're only entitled to those costs as the

So we think their costs come into it if a party

24

is not able to take heed of the 60-day notice period and

25

not able to cure within that period.

At that point,

The

4

citizens have information that they -- the Congress

5

QUESTION:

6

Mr. Stein, may I ask you this

7

question:

8

that if standing is not found, with the opportunity to go

9

forward with penalties and, of course, get counsel fees

one of the arguments that is being made here is

10

and investigatory fees and so on as a result of that, no

11

one is going to have really an incentive -- no citizen is

12

going to have an incentive ever to commence one of these

13

proceedings.

14

My question -- with that in mind my question is

15

this:

16

organization starts the 60-day period running it must then

17

have concluded that it can prove a case, or could a

18

citizens group simply come forward and say, we don't know

19

of any reason why this particular company should not have

20

been filing these reports.

21

they're covered by the law.

23

1

the citizens organization could decide whether to go ahead

2

and in effect make an investment in legal fees and

3

investigatory fees to see whether it would really be

4

worthwhile to bring action.

5

So that's why I ask the question.

Can they

6

simply put them on notice, as it were, on the basis of a

7

good faith claim that they ought to be filing, or is there

8

some requirement in the statute or regulations to the

9

effect that they must in effect be ready to establish

10

probable cause, or some such thing, for a violation before

11

they even give the notice that starts the 60 days running?

12

MR. STEIN:

I'm aware of no provision in the

13

statute that would require the latter.

14

the intent of the notice is precisely as you have

15

formulated it, to put the party on notice that they may be

16

out of compliance and that they have 60 days to cure, but

17

if at the end of that period they don't, the court's

18

jurisdiction could be invoked against them.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

I believe it is --

So nobody has to make a big

investment to get the 60 days running?
MR. STEIN:

I don't believe so, as, importantly,

2

3

MR. STEIN:

at this.

We believe that that is one of the primary

10

purposes of the notice, to prompt compliance, or

11

enforcement by EPA or compliance by the alleged violator,

12

that it is EPA's primary role to enforce these statutes

13

and, as stated by Congress, by saying that if EPA comes

I thought the question was, are you

asserting a continuing violation, or any reason to project

that there might be one, and I think the -- your answer

candidly is, the statute didn't require it and we didn't

plead it.

MR. STRAUSS:

What we pled was, what we asked

for was authorization to inspect their property.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, that's one way of reading

it, but they also seek an injunction that looks towards

that ambiguity a little.

to be interpreted more narrowly than it is, because

certainly the --

4

QUESTION:

Oh, I'm not suggesting the -- or, I

5

didn't mean to suggest by my question that the statute

6

should be interpreted so narrowly as to preclude standing

7

if there were an allegation of either a continuing

8

violation or the probability of a future violation, but

9

I'm concerned about the interpretive question when there

10

is no question of continuing violation in the sense that

11

they file everything that can be filed with respect to the

12

past, there is no allegation, and we'll leave the question

3

of ambiguity aside for the moment, of the likelihood of a

4

future violation, there is no penalty that can be

5

recovered that will go into the pocket of the private

6

plaintiff, and the only thing which is in issue is the

7

issue of attorney's fees or investigatory fees for the

8

time prior to the moment when litigation could be begun.

9

That's the scenario in which it seems to me

20

there is an Article III, a serious Article III question,

21

and it's on that scenario that I would suggest it might be

22

wise to interpret the statute narrowly to avoid having to

23

reach that issue.

24
25

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, let me just define the

class of plaintiffs who have a cause of action here and

2

then say why we think that there's no Article III problem.
The class of plaintiffs who have standing are

3

only those class of plaintiffs where the defendants files

4

the report only after receiving notice of an intended

5

citizen's suit.

6

That is what this statute authorized.

We derive that not just from the plain language

7

of the citizen's suit provision, which says that you can

8

sue for failure to file untimely reports, but by a

contrast between the notice --

Failure to complete and submit reports

Right, and the most natural

14

reading of under in that context is that it incorporates

15

the requirements from the reporting provisions so that

16

they did not have to be repeated all over again in the

17

citizen's suit provision, and one of those requirements is

18

that there has to be timely reports, so a failure to

19

submit and complete reports under those reporting

20

provisions encompasses a suit for the filing untimely

21

reports just as it encompasses a suit for inaccurate

22

information in those reports.

23

QUESTION:

Well, it may, but do you agree that

24

there is nothing further that can be done to redress the

prior failure?

All they show is that if there was

originally standing, that there was -- it was established

that there was going to be a continuing violation.

3

That simply does not eliminate the prior

established standing.

5

that in and of itself it establishes standing.

6

It's a huge leap from that to say

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No, I don't think it is a huge

leap as an Article III matter, because as an Article III

QUESTION:

I would agree with that if the

that this person was in violation and would continue in

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But we have a situation, though,

where the person has cured that original violation, and

the plaintiff at that point has the burden of showing that

Relative to the term under, the term
