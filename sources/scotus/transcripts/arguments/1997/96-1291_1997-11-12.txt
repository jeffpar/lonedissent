ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA G. HAYNIE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MS. HAYNIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
After 2 years of careful consideration, in

12

response to a regulatory void, Congress enacted the Older

13

Worker Benefit Protection Act to protect the rights of

14

older workers who were in greater force leaving -- being

15

forced to leave the work place.

16

The Older Worker Benefit Protection Act mandates

17

that an older worker may not waive their rights secured

18

under the ADEA unless such waiver is knowing and voluntary

19

as defined by the act.

20

If an employer chooses to utilize a waiver of

21

age discrimination rights, Congress requires an employer

22

to provide the older worker with the requisite information

23

and time to assess the value of the right to be waived.

24
25

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals' adoption of
the common law contract principles of ratification and

1

tender-back in addressing a situation where the employer

2

uses a waiver which is -- does not comply with the Older

3

Worker Benefit Protection Act will in all practical

4

purpose render the act meaningless.

5

QUESTION:

What would happen in the case if the

6

day after the release is signed, but before any money

7

changed hands, the employer says, we've made a mistake,

8

it's a good faith mistake, we didn't know about the ADEA,

9

we want to rescind the release?

10

MS. HAYNIE:

Well, Your Honor, pursuant to the

11

statute there is a revocation period of 7 days after the

12

release is signed.

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. HAYNIE:

15
16
17

No, but this is the employer.
I understand.

There will be a 7-

day -- that release is not effective pursuant to -QUESTION:

Well, let's change the hypothetical.

Suppose -- I want the release to be effective.

18

MS. HAYNIE:

7 days after it.

19

The employer would not have the right to rescind

20

the release.

It is an invalid release with regard to ADEA

21

claims if it does not comply with the statute.

22

rescind the release to all other waivers, I believe the

23

plaintiff or the older worker will have the right to

24

proceed against the employer.

QUESTION:

-- doesn't have to rescind it.
Excuse me.

You couldn't have an

4

equitable action to rescind the release at the employer's

5

behest?

Let's assume a good faith mistake on his part.
MS. HAYNIE:

6

No, sir.

If the waiver does not

7

comply with the requirements of the act, it is a void

8

waiver pursuant to -QUESTION:

9
10

Well then, he wouldn't have to pay --

he wouldn't have to pay any of the money, either?

11

QUESTION:

Right.

12

QUESTION:

If it's void, he wouldn't have to pay

13
14

the money.
MS. HAYNIE:

Well, the problem with not having

15

to pay the money, Your Honor, is that the waiver includes,

16

and particularly in this case, many other actions, other

17

than a waiver of ADEA --

18

QUESTION:

That's, it seems to me, one of the

19

points, is that this might very well be valid as to

20

everything but the ADEA.

21

MS. HAYNIE:

22

QUESTION:

And I believe that -There's a lot of talk on void and

23

voidable, but this covers so many claims that it seems to

24

me that's something that may be more of a problem for the

25

respondent than for you.

MS. HAYNIE:

1

2

ADEA claims.

3

I believe it would be void to the

I believe that --

QUESTION:

As to them, then, the employer can,

4

on day eight, say, I'm not going to pay anything insofar

5

as it might be attributable -- let's assume, keep the

6

example, that he broke down the various considerations and

7

said, with respect to this particular claim I'm not going

8

to pay anything because it's void, because it violates the

9

statute.

10
11

That would be legally proper, I take it, on your

view.
MS. HAYNIE:

That's correct, Your Honor, that

12

would be, and the plaintiff can go forward and pursue

13

their age discrimination claim in court.

14

QUESTION:

But in order to determine how much

15

harm we're doing by saying these things are void from the

16

outset I think we should be realistic and know that most

17

of them do not assign a certain amount of money to the

18

ADEA release and a certain amount of money to various

19

other releases, and I doubt very much, when it's not

20

broken out that way, whether you can say the contract is

21

valid in part and invalid as to that one little item.

22

mean, this is a standard question of severability.

23

I

I don't know how you can rip that contract

24

apart, especially when the ADEA claim is a very major part

25

of the consideration.

Do you know any other contract

1

that's picked apart like that where it's just partially

2

valid and we're going to enforce all the rest of it?

3

MS. HAYNIE:

Well, I think Congress has clearly

4

spoken here that if the waiver drafted by the employer

5

does not comply with the Older Worker Benefit Protection

6

Act - -

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. HAYNIE:

9

QUESTION:

Right.
That waiver is nonenforceable -Therefore that portion of the

10

contract is bad, and I would say the whole contract is

11

bad.
MS. HAYNIE:

12

-- because I do believe the other

13

portions of that waiver remain valid.

14

does not break out the enumeration for each right to be

15

waived, that's the argument to save the set-off for the

16

remedial phase of the trial.

17

QUESTION:

If the employer

So all the employers who have these,

18

have made these commitments can now simply stop paying

19

money.

20

MS. HAYNIE:

If they choose to stop paying money

21

and have not enumerated out which moneys are going to be

22

designated for which rights are being waived, then I

23

believe the plaintiff has a simple right of breach of

24

contract for all other rights that they had signed, if the

25

money has stopped.

QUESTION:

1

No, but a contract is -- you can't

2

pick apart a contract like that.

3

it's void.

4

MS. HAYNIE:

5

QUESTION:

If the contract's void,

Well, I -What do you mean, he's breached it?

6

How much money is he supposed to pay, two-thirds of the

7

full contract, or -- I mean, how do you decide how much?

8

MS. HAYNIE:

9

QUESTION:

10

MS. HAYNIE:

I -The full amount?
I agree, Your Honor, I believe

11

that's one of the practical problems of this case, and

12

that's why the tender back at the very beginning of a case

13

to bar plaintiff to going into court is very prac --

14

impractical.

15

QUESTION:

What I am worried about is, you are

16

destroying cause -- you are destroying entitlements to

17

these payments on the part of all older workers who have

18

been terminated, including the majority of them who do not

19

have any ADEA claims.

20

I'm not sure you're doing them a favor.

You're

21

saying if the employer is confident enough that this

22

worker doesn't have an ADEA claim he can just say, I'm

23

sorry, we made a mistake.

24
25

MS. HAYNIE:

Well, I believe that's what

Congress has established -8

QUESTION:

1

Well, Ms. Haynie, we aren't sure

2

about that, because Congress did not expressly say such an

3

agreement that fails to comply with these requirements is

4

void, as they have done in some other legislation.

5

don't say that, so at common law I suppose an agreement

6

where the employer was guilty of some kind of fraud,

7

duress, or coercion would be voidable, wouldn't it?

8

MS. HAYNIE:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Voidable at the option of the person

10

defrauded.

11

Congress didn't say, one way or another.

Maybe this contract is voidable, not void.

MS. HAYNIE:

12

They

I believe the phrase, may not

13

waive, is tantamount to announce, or proclaiming void any

14

waivers which do not comply with the Older Worker Benefit

15

Protection Act for those rights secured under the ADEA.
QUESTION:

16

But why?

Why would Congress wanted

17

to have done that, because what you're being told, I

18

think, from Justice Scalia and others, is let's imagine --

19

let's imagine that a -- that we have 100,000 workers who

20

are quitting, and each of them has a contract, and they

21

all promise not to bring claims, and each of them is paid

22

$5,000 for that promise.

All right.

Now, very few of them will have real ADEA

23
24

claims.

Very few.

But suppose they're all like this,

25

that they didn't comply with the rule exactly.

1

Now, on your theory one day every employer is

2

going to wake up to the fact that he hasn't bought a

3

single thing for his $5,000, and somebody might go around

4

and collect the lawsuits and sue everybody and get the

5

money back, so you'd be taking from 100,000 or 90 of the

6

100,000, $5,000 each have to go right back.

7

On the other hand, if you're wrong, all that

8

happens is when somebody has a good claim they have to put

9

up a little bit of money up front, whatever the

10

proportionate amount of the ADEA part is, which might be

11

$500, and the lawyer could front it for him.

12

So why would Congress want the result that you

13

want, which would seem to put at risk hundreds of

14

thousands of workers to have to give back the money who

15

would have no claim -- the employer would sue them -- and

16

at the same time to protect some lawyer from not having to

17

put up a very little money up front.

18

Now, I'm putting it strongly, but it's exactly

19

that practical consideration that I'm very disturbed about

20

in terms of your position.
MS. HAYNIE:

21
22

Your Honor, with regard to the

practical --

23

QUESTION:

It's not practical, it's legal, and

24

what I'm asking is, why would Congress have wanted that

25

result?

MS. HAYNIE:

Congress was very clear in enacting

2

this statute to protect the rights of older workers when

3

negotiating with employers when they're forced out of the

4

work place.

5

They are not arm-length negotiators.

Congress

6

put in very specific requirements an employer must meet so

7

that an employee knows they are giving up a valuable right

8

in exchange for that consideration.
If they're given adequate considera -- or

10

information, and there is some specter of discrimination,

11

then the employer can go -- the employee can go back to

12

the employer and negotiate for a greater severance or say,

13

no, I'm not going to sign this.

14

Without that knowledge, and without the time to

15

consider it in a coercion case, then the employee is

16

really left with no option but to take the money.

17

QUESTION:

We're not talking about the same

18

thing.

What I'm talking about is, I agree with you the

1

contract is no good.

20

sue.

21

promising not to sue is worthless.

I agree with you the employee can

I agree with you that that provision in the contract
It's no good.

The question involved is whether, before he

22

23

brings the lawsuit, he has to give back a proportionate

24

share of the money that he's been paid for his promise not

25

to sue.

I would imagine if they're paying five or $6,000

for such a promise he'd have to give $500 back, or -- and

2

the lawyer could put it up front.

3

MS. HAYNIE:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Well -So what is the big problem about --

that you're worried about?
MS. HAYNIE:

The problem is twofold, Your Honor.

7

First, the monetary amount could be greater.

9

looking for other employment.

10

The employee

The second problem is, who is to decide what the

11

proportionate share will be?

12

means you're in court already.

QUESTION:

15
16

determined?

That's going to have to be
That

Well, can a proportionate share be

How do we determine the proportionate share?

MS. HAYNIE:

The proportionate share can be

17

determined at the end of the litigation, when a trial

18

judge has taken into --

19

QUESTION:

Well, I thought courts have routinely

20

said they are unable to make that kind of a determination.

21

I mean, they can't do that.

22

MS. HAYNIE:

23

QUESTION:

Well, if you -You get a -- you either have to give

24

it all back or none, as I see it.

25

1

MS. HAYNIE:

If you require the plaintiff to

2

tender back all the money received, then it is the

3

employer who receives the windfall there, because the

4

employee has waived many other rights under that waiver.

5

The employer can raise the defense.

6

QUESTION:

But if you say the contract is void,

7

then what you're doing is saying that the ADEA tail wags

8

the State law dog with respect to all releases.

9

saying that all State law releases, State claim releases

10

are, I take it, void because the contract is not

11

severable.
MS. HAYNIE:

12

You are

No, I don't believe that, Your

13

Honor.

I don't believe that.

I believe Congress spoke

14

directly and specifically to those rights secured under

15

the ADEA.

16

QUESTION:

Ms. Haynie, suppose --

17

QUESTION:

Ms. Haynie, did -- maybe I

18

misunderstood your argument, but I thought your position

19

was, may not waive is -- leaves employer and employee

20

without any authority, without any power to do anything

21

with respect to the ADEA claim.

22

That being so, you construe this contract as

23

though what may not be done wasn't done, so that the only

24

thing that would be covered would be the non-ADEA claims.

25

Maybe you're not making that argument.

MS. HAYNIE:

1

No, I am making that argument, Your

2

Honor, that again the statute speaks specifically to ADEA

3

claims, and those are the -- that is the waiver that is

void.

the plaintiff who signs it.

That is the waiver that is nonenforceable against

All other waivers of claims can be possibly

enforceable against the plaintiff, unless the plaintiff

8

can show that it was not an involuntary waiver.
QUESTION:

9

What if it was just an ADEA claim

here, so that we didn't have the problem of breaking out a

11

partial amount, and the -- would you say that the employee

12

did not have to tender it back?

That's correct, Your Honor.

2

Well, supposing the plaintiff loses

3

MS. HAYNIE:

I believe that part of the

That's totally contrary to any

QUESTION:

No, but you don't have to have

3

judicial common law development with respect to the

4

protections of this statute, I suppose, in order to

5

recognize that if on a void contract there is a total

failure of consideration the employer at least would have

the right to bring action for the return of the

he would have such an action?

I'm not talking about tender-backs.

I'm simply saying, let's assume that your conclusion is

correct, and we recognize it.

15

The employer says -- and by the way, we're

MR. PHILLIPS:

You say the suit was

That's correct.

But the statute says the individual

can't waive.

MR. PHILLIPS:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the FELA is exactly on

point in my favor on this, Your Honor, because there the

language of section 55 says as plainly as possible any

4

contract or device to limit the liability of an employer

5

is void, and it says it in so many words.

QUESTION:

But that's significant in this case

for another reason.

This waiver is void only insofar as

it waives FE -- ADEA claims.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, that goes back to Justice

Scalia's question about severability.
QUESTION:

Your point is that the FELA language

about void does not find a counterpart in the ADEA.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Exactly.

Congress had a model it

17

could follow in this context.

18

that describes the matter as void, it also had a decision

19

of this Court that enforced that statute in a way that

eliminated the tender-back requirement, and Congress

didn't follow that model here.

QUESTION:

MR. PHILLIPS:

But Your Honor, if the position

of the common law would have set aside the contract for

reasons of coercion or duress or fraud or any of those

other reasons, it's still, under those circumstances, no

more than voidable, and so it would seem --

QUESTION:

We have an example, Mr. Phillips of

you agree that that's -- the essence of this case is for

us to construe what those words mean, may not waive, and I

take that to be an instruction to the employer as well as

to the employee, so may I ask you to respond to the

22

question that I put to Ms. Haynie?

23

That is, one way to look at what Congress did,

these words, may not waive, is to say, well, that's a

in,

the contract -- the employer knowing that full well, by

the way -- the contract then must be construed to waive

generally about returning the whole thing or not, but I'm

sure that where a contract contains several items, and the

value all of those items depends upon future

those contingencies to occur, such as the bringing of a

Now, what

are you asking -- I'm not sure how much difference it

wasn't clear from your brief, are you asking us to look to

the law of a particular State here?
MR. PHILLIPS:

10

No, although that might be a

11

suitable vehicle for deciding this case, but as it happens

12

the law in Louisiana is exactly the Federal common law,

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

Is that what we're talking about?
No.

What we do have is a Federal

question to decide where you look to the law, and my

instinctive reaction is that you ought to look to the

principles of State law and borrow those principles.

13

In this particular case, however, it makes no

difference, because Louisiana, like the law of every

You say the two cases are exactly the same.

(Laughter.)

15

QUESTION:

Supposing one reads the statute

16

noting that it doesn't use the word void or voidable,

they're simply saying that when you have a release which

purports to release 19 different claims, and if one of

19

those claims is an ADEA claim the release shall not be

20

enforceable insofar as it purports to release that claim,

QUESTION:

MR. PHILLIPS:

What question doesn't it answer?
It doesn't answer the question

whether you have an obligation to tender back as a

precondition --

QUESTION:

It says it shall not be enforceable,

period, regardless of whether you're able or willing or

not to tender back.

9

what the mean -- and isn't that a fair reading of the

10
11

Doesn't -- isn't it perfectly clear

plain language of this statute?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, because that gives a meaning

12

to the word waiver that is much broader than that term is

entitled to carry.

The meaning is, it shall not be

they must comply with these provisions, which your client

Therefore, you have a perfectly valid

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's correct.

So I don't understand why that

respected.

We're going to drop the barrier significantly,

2

and second, we're going to impose upon the employer an

3

ongoing obligation to prove that this was knowing and

4

voluntary, a burden of proof that otherwise doesn't exist.

5

By doing that -- and if we don't satisfy those

6

requirements, she is free to go into court against those

common law doctrines that would clearly prevent her from

going into court, and that's what Congress had in mind.

Texas, where it says, when Congress sits down and tries to

modify the common law, we do not presume that Congress

means to undo any broader than Congress states expressly

in the language of the statute itself.

2

her an opportunity to avoid a forfeiture, a forfeiture of

3

her right that arises as an independent common law

4

doctrine.

5

QUESTION:

But if the common law in a State were

6

not the unreasonable position that a may-not-waive

7

provision leaves both sides powerless, so the contract is

8

construed, as Justice Stevens suggested, to cover

9

everything else that could be covered to dispose of

10

anything the parties could dispose of, but just as though

11

it weren't there, the thing that they can't dispose of, so

12

the common law, let's, say, in New York or New Jersey was

13

not as you described it to be in Louisiana, could we then

14

say that for these kinds of claims the Age Discrimination

15

Act is going to mean one thing in one State, another thing

16

in another State, or that there will be the Federal common

17

law so that you'd have the same rule in all the States?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think the farthest you can go

19

with Federal common law is to deal with precisely how you

20

analyze the precise waiver, because that comes from the

21

statute, and if you have interstices within the

22

application of 626(f), it seems to me those you would

23

clearly fill in by reference to --

it's going to be void, but nonetheless at the end of the

day in Hogue the Court said we're going to require an

offset at the end of the day.

employer already had paid.
Now, what about such a provision?

MR. PHILLIPS:

If the plaintiff recovers

approach the Court followed there would necessarily be the

course they would follow here.

MR. PHILLIPS: No.

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Maybe it should do that here --

-- and does that partially meet your

concern?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, obviously, as between

17

having an opportunity to get some money back at the end of

18

the day or not, undoubtedly my client would prefer that

19

alternative, but the truth is, what we seek to have

20

vindicated here is the common law rule, recognized in all

by saying that the tender-back requirement can be looked

2

at as essentially a remedial condition.

3

We're not going to give a remedy when the person

keeps 100 percent of what, in fact, he is claiming

5

inoperative, and therefore we're going to leave the

6

question of what has to be, in effect, tendered and

ultimately paid back to the remedy stage.
At the remedy stage, the Federal court does have

8

9

fairly broad powers to craft a remedy without any

violation of Erie, and therefore solve both the problem of

11

state variation and the tender-back problem by saying it's

may never get anything back.
