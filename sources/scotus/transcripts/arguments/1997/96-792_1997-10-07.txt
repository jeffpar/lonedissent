ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN MALENG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. MALENG:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the important question of

12

whether a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity when

13

she causes an arrest warrant to issue in conjunction with

14

her filing of criminal charges against an individual.

15

In this case, Deputy Prosecutor Lynne Kalina

16

reviewed and professionally evaluated a completed police

17

report, determined that a burglary charge would be filed,

18

and then prepared and filed an Information, a motion

19

requesting the issuance of an arrest warrant, and a

20

certification which summarized the evidence for the court.

21

In Imbler, Buckley, and Burns, this Court set

22

forth a workable approach to determine which functions of

23

a prosecutor are entitled to absolute immunity.

24

immunity applies when the challenged activity is

25

undertaken in the prosecutor's role as advocate for the

2

the criminal process, and is connected with the initiation

and conduct of a prosecution.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Maleng, is the crucial thing here

5

the Information or the application for the arrest warrant?

6

What was the basis for the action against the officials?

7

MR. MALENG:

It was a burglary charge, Mr. Chief

8

Justice, and as a part of the charging package is, the

9

deputy prosecutor prepared an Information which was the

10

initial pleading in a prosecution, also requested the

11

issuance of an arrest warrant, and provided the

12

certification to the court to meet the Gernstein

13

requirement.

Each of the factors which - -

QUESTION:

16
17
18

Well, in Washington could a police

officer have obtained the arrest warrant?
MR. MALENG:

Justice O'Connor, the police

officer could not have obtained the arrest warrant.

19

QUESTION:

20

other States in that regard?

21

MR. MALENG:

So Washington is different from most

It is different than many States

22

and, of course, there's a diversity of procedures

23

throughout the United States, but in the State of

24

Washington is that an arrest warrant cannot be issued

unless it's in connection with the filing of a - 4

QUESTION:

1

In a State where a police officer

2

could obtain the arrest warrant, even though the

3

prosecutor filed the Information against a defendant,

4

would the police officer have absolute immunity under our

5

case law for a false statement in getting the arrest

6

warrant?

8

MR. MALENG:

officer would not have absolute immunity.
QUESTION:

10

13

No.

We would look at the function,

this Court said.
MR. MALENG:

11

12

No, Justice O'Connor, the police

We would look to the function,

but - QUESTION:

And what would be the function if the

14

police officer were getting it?

15

MR. MALENG:

If a police officer was obtaining

16

the arrest warrant it would be the part of the completion

17

of his investigation in preparation for handing the case

18

over to the prosecutor.

1

QUESTION:

I might just --

Now, do you say that the function is

20

different in Washington, where the prosecutor gets the

21

arrest warrant?

22

25

MR. MALENG:

The principles that we are

advocating - QUESTION:

Or is it the same function?

I don't

know how you analyze what the function is when the -- in

this case, where it is the prosecuting attorney who gets

the arrest warrant.

3

police officer does?

4

How is that different from where the

MR. MALENG:

The analysis is really the same in

5

this sense.

6

by a prosecutor, and as a part of that initiation, a

7

prosecutor, as recognized in the Buckley case, can take a

8

whole series of preliminary acts leading up to that

9

initiation.

It is part of the initiation of a prosecution

10

In our State, one of those preliminary acts that

11

goes together with the Information is the preparation of a

12

certification.

13

jury State, is that a police office may obtain an arrest

14

warrant and that would be different than occurs in our

15

State, but the police officer is performing a different

16

function.

In other States, and let's say a grand

17

The principal in Imbler protects that sensitive

18

decision for prosecutors to initiate a prosecution and to

19

conduct a prosecution.

QUESTION:

If you simply have an Information

21

filed and don't seek an arrest warrant, is this

certification necessary

least in King County's as a local rule, is that we are

2

required to provide a summary, a brief summary of the

3

facts for the court, and so our certification really meets

4

two purposes.

5

King County we have a local rule that requires us to

6

provide a brief summary to the court.

7

One is the Gernstein requirement, but in

QUESTION:

But is it possible that in some cases

8

in King County there would be an Information filed but not

9

an effort to immediately arrest the person?
MR. MALENG:

10

In the State of Washington as a

11

matter of routine, any time that we file an Information in

12

a felony case is that we request the issuance of an arrest

13

warrant.

14

serious type of a felony offense, is that a series of

15

letters is sent out to the defendant, which occurred in

16

the case before the Court, requesting their voluntary

17

appearance, and if that occurs, the case proceeds.

The next step that is taken, if it's a less

18

QUESTION:

So here, letters were sent before the

19

arrest warrant was issued requesting the defendant to

20

surrender?

21

MR. MALENG:

After the arrest warrant was

22

ordered by the Court but before it was actually served

23

there was several letters that were sent to the defendant,

24

but they went to the wrong address, and did not reach the

25

defendant, and when that occurred the arrest warrant was

2

QUESTION:

Is - - does the prosecutor's

3

description or summary that you just explained have to be

4

under oath?

5

MR. MALENG:

The certification, yes, does need

6

to be under the oath to meet the Gernstein requirement,

7

that we really adopted this procedure in the State of

8

Washington following the Gernstein decision, and it not

9

only meets the requirements of Gernstein, but we believe

10

that it is a better practice to follow to have the

11

prosecutor prepare this document, and the reason is,

12

that I think it really acts as a citizen's buffer,

13

a prosecutor, by preparing the certification,

14

provides for a more thorough evaluation of the police

15

file.

I think

You're not just reading through it, but you're

17

And it's also a benefit to the court, because it

18

provides a more orderly flow of information to the court,

19

rather than getting it from, let's say in King County,

20

where there's 26 different police jurisdictions.
QUESTION:

21

Mr. Maleng,

is it the case here that

the certification could have been executed by a police

officer, but is the standard practice in the 39 counties

3

in the State of Washington and really for the reasons that

4

I advanced.

5

It could have been prepared by a police

QUESTION:

Right.

I understand that.

If a

6

police officer did prepare a certification, I take it on

7

your view the police officer would also be subject to an

8

absolute immunity.

9

MR. MALENG:

Under those circumstances the -- if

10

it was prepared by a police officer, he would not have

11

absolute immunity unless he was - -

12

QUESTION:

How is that possible under what I

13

understand to be the functional approach, and the

14

functional approach that your argument assumed, and that

15

was that it was the function, not the officer, with

16

respect to which the immunity decision is made?

17

MR. MALENG:

First is that, unlike a prosecutor,

18

is the police wouldn't meet the threshold question of

19

immunity analysis, and that is that there's no common law

20

tradition of absolute immunity for a police officer.

21

QUESTION:

Well, but he's performing the same

22

function and, I mean, the theory of the way the common law

23

practice is applied to immunity doctrine is, we look to

24

the function and see whether that function at common law

25

was subject to an immunity.

Now if, on that standard, the prosecutor gets

absolute immunity, then it's -- I think it necessarily

follows that the police officer would get absolute

immunity.

officer, so why are they different?
MR. MALENG:

This Court has set forth the

12

functional test and said that we look to the nature and

13

function of the act being performed, and not just to the

14

act itself.

15

QUESTION:

And the nature and function of the

16

act here is the provision of information under oath, with

17

whatever probability of soundness that oath carries, on

18

the basis of which a magistrate is going to issue an

19

arrest warrant.

20

the same whether it's performed by a police officer or

21

whether it's performed by a prosecutor.

22

That function, it seems to me, is exactly

MR. MALENG:

It is a different function if it's

23

performed by a police officer, as a police officer can't

24

move from the "investigative function" over to the

25

prosecutorial advocacy function, namely -10

QUESTION:

1

Are you saying that a police officer

2

never has absolute immunity because he's always engaged in

3

investigating and never crosses the divide into

4

prosecuting, so that the same -- the very same act which

5

we all agree is involved here, the same act is

6

characterized one way if it's done by a police officer, a

7

different way if it's done by the prosecutor, because the

8

prosecutor does prosecute, and police officers don't

9

prosecute?
MR. MALENG:

10

A police officer, Justice Ginsburg,

11

would have absolute immunity if they were functioning as a

12

witness.

13

attached to a prosecutor's office and was acting under the

14

direction of a prosecutor and acting as the agent, yes,

15

they would have absolute immunity in that circumstances,

16

but generally no, because they are performing a different

17

function.

18

I believe a police officer also, if he was

QUESTION:

But how does the same act, swearing

19

out this warrant application, become prosecutorial if done

20

by one person but merely investigatory if done by another?

21

MR. MALENG:

this Court has indicated also, I

22

believe, is that you can have a situation in which

23

prosecutors do a whole series of preliminary acts in

24

conjunction with the filing of criminal charges.

25

Now, some of those acts can be performed by

1

someone other than a prosecutor, for example, a police

2

officer questioning witnesses, visiting a crime scene,

3

signing a certification.

4

performed by a prosecutor, the full force and reasons for

5

absolute immunity apply.

6

But when those functions are

The difference between that and the police

7

officer is that the police officer can't be a part of the

8

function that this Court has protected, and the function

9

that is being protected is the sensitive decision to

10

initiate a prosecution which can involve, as the Buckley

11

case said and this Court reaffirmed, can have a whole

12

series of things associated with that, so it is really a

13

different function.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Maleng, I think you're doing --

15

making the following assumption in your argument, and I'd

16

like you to comment on it.

17

to put the issue here is, how do we characterize this

18

function of providing the certification?

19

The issue, I guess -- one way

Do we characterize it in a very narrow and

20

specific sense of providing the certification, period --

21

we carve that out -- or do we characterize it as part of a

22

broader process, the process of initiating a prosecution?

23

If we characterize it in the narrow sense,

24

merely providing, in effect, evidence under oath, then

25

there doesn't seem to be anything peculiar about that

1

function to prosecutors.

Police officers can do it.

2

If we characterize it in the broad sense and

3

say, oh, it's just a part of initiating a prosecution,

4

then we're talking about a function that prosecutors do

5

and that prosecutors, generally speaking, get absolute

6

immunity for, and it seems to me that when we ask you the

7

question, how do you characterize, you shift back and

8

forth, and I don't think we - - I mean, we really can't

9

shift back and forth.
I would have thought that the reason for

10

11

characterizing it narrowly was the Malley case.

12

Malley case, generally speaking it's prosecutors that get

13

search warrants, but witnesses who come forward to provide

14

evidence for those search warrants don't get absolute

15

immunity, and I would have thought that there was an

16

analogy there to this situation.

17

warrants, but prosecutors don't necessarily provide

18

evidence.

19

In the

Prosecutors get arrest

So it would have seemed to me that the Malley

20

case was a reason to characterize the function narrowly as

21

presenting evidence, as opposed to characterizing the

22

function broadly as just a little part of going after or

23

getting a search warrant and starting a prosecution.

24

my argument wrong about the application of Malley in

deciding whether you take the narrow view or the broad

view?
MR. MALENG:

Justice Souter, I think you've

3

really raised the issue before the Court, and that is

4

whether you take the broad view or the narrow view.

5

think that what the Court was indicating in the Malley

6

case is expressing also a concern in making incognizance

7

comparisons between the activities of police officers and

8

the activities of prosecutors, and shows that there's a

9

dramatic difference between those type of activities.

11

14

QUESTION:

I

But Malley took the narrow view on

the way you and I are using the terms, didn't it?
MR. MALENG:

Malley took the view that a police

officer cannot be held to be analogous to a prosecutor.
QUESTION:

Right, but the Malley case said, when

15

you're getting a search warrant, which is essentially a

16

prosecutorial kind of function, the witness, the police

17

witness does not get an absolute immunity, and it seems to

18

me there's an analogy here.

19

prosecutions.

20

incident of that is getting the arrest warrant, but it's

21

che provision of evidence on the basis of which the arrest

22

warrant issues that seems to be analogous to the provision

23

of evidence on the basis of which the search warrant

24

issues, so it seems to me that Malley took the narrow

25

view, and my question is, why shouldn't we, for

Prosecutors initiate

1

2

consistency reasons, take the narrow view here?
MR. MALENG:

What the Court indicated, Justice

3

Souter, in the Malley case is that the police officer in

4

that situation was one step removed, really, from the

5

initiation of a prosecution, and was really not intimately

6

associated with the judicial phase of the criminal

7

process, and that's true throughout the whole activities,

8

because, as I indicated, what the Court was seeking to do

9

in the Imbler case is to protect the sensitive decision to

10

prosecute, to initiate a prosecution, and the Court in the

11

Buckley cases reaffirmed the fact that a prosecutor may

12

undertake a whole series of preliminary acts in

13

conjunction with the initiation of that prosecution.

In the State of Washington, it is

beginning that Lynne Kalina is a deputy prosecutor and is

familiar with the police report, and investigation

QUESTION:

She goes on to sign it under penalty

8

of perjury, which I understand she's not required to do,

9

or correct me if I'm wrong.
MR. MALENG:

10

She is required to sign it under

11

oath for purposes of meeting the Gernstein principle, but

12

the fact that she does or doesn't sign shouldn't be the

13

factor that determines whether absolute immunity applies

or not.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

17

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

18

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

19
20
21

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Justice O'Connor and Justice Souter both asked

22

the critical question in this case, and that is, how we

23

define the function that is at issue.

24

defined as it was in Malley, and that is the function of

25

seeking an arrest warrant, not simply the signing of a

certification.
What is critical in this case, and is a critical

3

distinction from Malley, is the function of seeking an

4

arrest warrant in conjunction with the filing of criminal

5

charges against an individual.

6

In Malley, the police officer sought the arrest

7

warrant without the involvement of a prosecutor long

8

before any indictment process had started by a prosecutor.

9

There was no prosecutorial decision.

In that sense, the

10

criminal judicial process had not yet been invoked by the

11

Government, and that is the critical distinction in this

12

case in our opinion.

13

The reason - -

14

QUESTION:

Would it be the same case if she had

15

filed a certification just as a lawyer but not sworn to

16

anything, and then the magistrate had said to her when she

17

appeared in court, I'd like to know whether the defendant

18

had any access to the property before, do you have a

19

witness who can testify to that, and she had responded,

20

yes, and then he swore her as a witness and she said

21

exactly what she said here.

22

MS. MILLETT:

Would she be immune?

We believe that she would get

23

absolute immunity for statements in court, whether it

24

would be considered prosecutorial immunity or witness

25

immunity under Burns v. Reed and Briscoe v. LaHue.

It may not satisfy the Fourth Amendment, but, of

1

2

course, the Fourth Amendment violation does not strip one

of immunity, else it would be no immunity at all.

Do you think the witness immunity in

I think - QUESTION:

MS. MILLETT:

Either one, right.

-- a search warrant may be much

11

further away from the criminal judicial process, but once

12

the process has been initiated by the Government, as it

13

has here, or triggered as it is in the Federal system,

14

that as written or - - whether a statement is written or

15

said in court should not make a functional difference for

16

purposes of absolute immunity, so we actually believe that

17

had a police officer signed it or, for example, the

18

suspect information report that was also filed with the

19

Information and request for arrest warrant here would

20

merit absolute immunity.

21

QUESTION:

Well, your view, uiien -- I want to be

22

sure I understand.

23

signed by a police officer, there would be immunity.

24
25

Your view is, even if this had been

It would.

equivocating somewhat about a prosecutor here is just

QUESTION:

Do I understand that you are drawing

a straight time line?

You are saying yes, under Malley it

doesn't matter who the actor is, it's the function, so you

10

are saying -- which I didn't understand from the brief --

11

that whether it's a police officer or prosecutor, once

12

it's the prosecution is being put before the court,

13

anybody who signs this application gets absolute immunity.

14

MS. MILLETT:

QUESTION:

I believe --

But if it's removed, it's before the

16

prosecutor has decided whether there's going to be a

17

criminal case, then it's only qualified whoever that --

question, I believe the time line is absolutely critical

20

for purposes of deciding whether - - is a critical factor

21

in functional analysis, and yes, it's very relevant here,

22

because the time line -- it's not so much a date time

which is exactly what the purposes of immunity doctrine

25

are supposed to cover.

but it's an initiation of the judicial process,

I think before actual initiation of a criminal

2

prosecution or a criminal proceedings, say if there was a

3

search warrant back at the investigatory stage, it's a

4

harder question, because in one sense any time a prosec --

5

and this is what the Court noted in Burns v. Reed.

6

Any time a prosecutor is coming to a court and

7

presenting information to the court to provide the basis

8

for a judicial action, that that should merit absolute

9

prosecutorial immunity.

You're acting in an advocatory

10

role, and the reason we give immunity is to protect the

11

process itself, the ability of the court to collect

12

information and make the decisions necessary in that case.

13

So it may be a little bit harder when we're --

14

the further we get away from the initiation of the

15

criminal process, the harder the question is.

16

that.

17

We concede

But you would still need to consider the

18

important goal of absolute immunity to allow the judicial

19

system to receive information, however delivered, whether

20

one thinks it's a proper way or improper, ethical or

21

unethical, whatever mistaken -- but the important thing is

22

that the process be protected, and that's what we think

absolute immunity would protect in this situation.

beginning of a judicial proceeding, too, and I assume that

2

your argument assumes that there is a historic -- given

3

the way we go about the immunity question that there is a

4

basis in historical practice for distinguishing between

5

the immunity that seems to be implied by the initiation of

6

the one judicial process, search warrants, and the other

7

judicial process, arrest warrant and filing of charges.
Is there, and where would I find the historical

8

9
10
11

basis for drawing the line where you would have us draw
it?
MS. MILLETT:

The closest, strongest case for

12

the common law precedent for immunity in this context

13

which we think is on fours with this situation is a case,

14

Kitler v. Kelsh, which is cited I believe on page 19 of

15

our brief, and was cited by this Court in Imbler.

16

And there what you had was a prosecutor who

17

swore out an arrest warrant, swore out a complaint, and in

18

that context, from the description in the case, the

19

complaint was not only legal claims but factual claims

20

and, in fact, when you look at the dissent in that case,

21

the dissent advocated drawing the exact line that

22

respondents propose here, and that is that you get

absolute immunity for filing the complaint and seeking the

QUESTION:

That had nothing to do with

2

functional distinctions.

The common law distinction was

between giving evidence and initiating a prosecution.

There was civil liability for wrongful initiation of a

prosecution.

There was no civil liability for testimony.

MS. MILLETT:

QUESTION:

Well, I think --

And that's the explanation of that

case, not the functional distinction that our cases have,

MS. MILLETT:

Well, I think it - - there's more

than sort of two factors coming together.

the question of whether it was private or a public

14

prosecutorial decision that was being made.

15

the complaining witness cases that are cited by this Court

16

in the Malley case all involved private persons, and so

there's an entirely separate argument for why absolute

immunity did not attach to that, and the --

QUESTION:

There's also

For example,

It's the implication of what you're

saying that Malley was wrongly decided.
MS. MILLETT:

No.

The implication is that

private complaining witness than we have here, where Ms.

2

Kalina, or the police officer, or whomever is signing the

3

affidavit, is affiliated with the actual onset of judicial

4

proceedings, and it is the onset of judicial proceedings

5

and the provision of information to the court for that

6

ongoing process that is critical.

7

And one of the reasons it's critical is, again,

8

unlike the police officer in Malley v. Briggs, a

9

prosecutor in this context is going to have ongoing

10

responsibilities in the case and ongoing duties that will

11

be supervised and protected by the court, and the

12

defendant will also have those protections.
QUESTION:

13

Would your argument be different if

14

we were dealing with a State in which the historical

15

practice had been traditionally that the -- what is called

the certification here, the statement under oath about

opposed to prosecutors?

19

MS. MILLETT:

that I don't think got answered.

The focus of this is on the certification that

made it possible, both under the Federal Constitution and

Another question I'd like to point out is

Washington law does provide for summons procedures in

felony cases, nonseizure-type documents.

MR. FORD:

It is not in the nature of a

of a false arrest claim, just as the Malley case was, and,

5

of course, under the Albright case there's considerably

controversy at least over whether you even have a 1983

certainly Mr. Fletcher's damages would be very different

if they existed at all.

It is in the nature

The next question, I'd like to answer Justice

O'Connor's question about whether police officers can

14

would differ with Mr. Maleng with regard to whether, under

15

Washington law, a police officer could obtain an arrest

16

warrant without the interposition of a prosecutor.

17

Under our justice court rules, or lower court

18

rules, Washington has a procedure where the prosecutors

19

have begun to file direct in superior court Informations,

21

lower courts.

under oath to facts that make out probable cause.

3

QUESTION:

What is the jurisdiction over -- what

4

kind of criminal actions do those lower courts have

jurisdiction over?
MR. FORD:

That rule itself, Your Honor, would

7

only deal with misdemeanors, but in felonies you can also

have those same courts have jurisdiction issue arrest

warrants, although I admit it would not be on the

10

complaint only of a citizen or police officer for

11

felonies.

And this was a felony involved here.

This was a felony, although I'm

1

All right, and then they're saying,

but Washington, oddly enough, that isn't so.

3

Washington, the only time you arrest a felon with a

4

warrant, the only time, is in conjunction with a

5

prosecutor filing an Information, and there is no other

6

time, and therefore, unlike all other States, because of

7

this odd quirk of Washington procedure, the arrest of a

8

felon is part of the court function, the court filing

function.

10

In

It's not in Rhode Island, it's not anywhere

11

else, because it exists in other places that you could

arrest a person without filing an Information, but not so

in Washington, so in those other places it's a police

duty, in Washington it's different.

I'm not buying that argument, but I want to

It was exactly the same function.
He was having him arrested to answer a criminal

that he had read and he swore under oath that that made

out probable cause, and went to a judge, and the judge --

the judge have a complaint or a writ ne exit, or whatever

2

you'd call it, and arresting somebody based on the sworn

3

statement of that person, who is called a complaining

4

witness at common law, very ancient law in this regard --

5

QUESTION:

The point I was trying to make was

6

that if you compare the facts in Malley with the facts in

7

this case, the facts in Malley seem to have been further

8

removed from the determination of probable cause, because

9

there it ultimately went to a grand jury after all the

10

Malley facts had happened, and the grand jury refuses to

11

indict.

12

13
14

Here, the Information is filed, and that in
itself is a determination of probable cause.
MR. FORD:

Well, it's an initial determination

15

of probable cause, Your Honor, but it doesn't justify an

16

arrest, and in Washington, of course, it's not final.

17

also do have a safeguard under a case called State v.

18

Knapstad, where a judge can determine whether the

19

prosecutor did, in fact, have probable cause to bring this

20

Information.

22

the common denominator we have now in our States and in

2

swear to facts, and get some kind of an order that allows

3

somebody else's body to be seized, they were never held to

4

be immune from liability before 1871, before 1791 when the

5

Oath or Affirmation Clause was put into the Fourth

6

Amendment establishing the function that we believe is

7

relevant here, a very ancient and important function of

8

providing that oath or affirmation.

9

It's never been subject to immunity, and the

10

fact that the prosecutors in Washington have really

11

voluntarily, just as a matter of their own practice and

12

convenience, or perhaps for this reason, usurped that

13

function, without even the Washington legislature or court

14

rules telling them to, and said well, we'll be the

15

witnesses here, they have taken on a function that

prosecutors as far as I can tell, reading --we cited some

1

this particular context, where a person comes in, a person

2

who might say exactly the same things at a trial and be

3

absolutely immune, but when the context is the initiation

4

of a matter before some kind of judicial officer, the

5

purpose of which is to take somebody's body into custody,

6

that that person has never been held immune from liability

no matter what their rank in society.

8

11

QUESTION:

But it wasn't defamation liability,

as the perjured testimony would be.

It was liability for

malicious prosecution, essentially, right?
MR. FORD:

I think the differences between

12

malicious prosecution and false arrest and trespass, and

13

trespass on the case, and the different things in the

14

common law have -- I have not grasped yet, Justice Scalia,

15

but what I understand is that whatever you called it at

16

that time, nobody recognized it as a circumstance in which

17

a person should be immune from liability, even though they

18

were doing something, swearing, very much like what they

19

could do in court under absolute immunity.

20

When they did it in this context, when ex parte,

21

I would assume that the policy reasons are because there

22

is no protection of the courtroom, it's an ex parte

23

proceeding, it involves an initiation of a very drastic

24

governmental action against a person, whatever those

25

policy reasons were, the common law in 1871 was clear that

1

in that context a swearer, a person who took an oath or

2

affirmation, was not subject to the immunities that they

3

would be later in the proceeding, and I think that is the

4

difference, and there's no historical basis -- this one

5

1927 -QUESTION:

6

So Mr. Ford, if the prosecutor did

7

the same thing, but once the trial is going on says, I

8

need to arrest this material witness, and the police

9

report tells me this, this, and this, and so I swear out

10

an arrest warrant, but it's in court while the trial is

11

going on to hold the material witness, that would be

12

absolutely immune?
MR. FORD:

13

That is a fascinating question,

14

Justice Ginsburg.

15

course the material witness is not a party to the lawsuit,

16

and how the common law would have treated that I do not

17

know.

also seems to be kind of like initiating a new proceeding

against a material witness.

MR. FORD:

I was having trouble, Justice

13

Ginsburg, because I don't think anybody ever thought of

that question before, and as I'm thinking about it, I

15

think that that is the initiation of a new action against

the material witness, and would not be subject to

14

Justice.

15

I would say that with regard - - my thoughts have

16

been with regard to the defendant himself or herself.

17

With regard to that person, once you're in court in the

heat of battle swearing or avowing or proffering is the

19

more usual situation, that that is within the witness

20

immunity if it's a witness, the prosecutorial immunity if

21

it's a prosecutor.

22

But the initiation of a new proceeding to

procedure.

criminal prosecutions, and when -- where the police hand

2

off to the prosecutors, and to draw a line straight

3

through based on Washington's particular procedure I think

4

would be extraordinarily difficult and create different

5

rules in different States.

6

And, of course, in section 1983 the Civil Rights

7

Act was supposed to, I think, establish Federal minimums

8

for the protection of residents of the various States

9

regardless of what their State officials decided to do,

10

and when the -- the fact that our State officials and our

11

prosecutors have over the years said, well, wouldn't it be

12

easier if we just swear the witnesses, and we just

13

provided the oath or affirmation rather than have police

14

officers or FBI agents or the various people who do it in

15

every other jurisdiction of the country perhaps save one,

16

that can't change the constitutional rights and remedies

of the people of Washington that were enshrined in 1871

says it changes to - - from an illegal arrest to a legal

Counsel referred to Buckley as if the court

2

granted prosecutorial immunity there, and I think it did

3

not, and I think that's the answer to Justice Souter's

4

questions about how broadly do you define under the -- I

5

think the petitioners here are really refighting Buckley

6

and saying, well, everything we do is designed to, you

7

know, convict or to prosecute or decide whether to

8

prosecute or not, so everything we do should be

prosecutorial, and Buckley certainly said that's not the

10

case with regard to particularly one function that was, I

11

think, very analogous to what happened here, which is the

12

manufacturing of false evidence.

13

In a very real sense, our claim is that Lynne

Kalina manufactured false evidence against Rodney

15

Fletcher, and she did so not only with regard to the

trial, but with regard to a critical moment when nobody

else was there in court to correct it, that the common law

and the cases of the majority of circuits, certainly, have

analyze the function, and in one sense you can say that in

for a crime, and here the function being served was to

Can you help me with something else I

don't know, and perhaps -- are there grand jury

indictments as well in Washington?

22

MR. FORD:

There can be, Your Honor.

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

All right.

When the grand jury

24

indicts someone, then that's automatically probable cause

25

to try the person, isn't it?

QUESTION:

That's my understanding.

All right -- oh.

It's very

Well, what I really

4

wanted to know is, is it also probable cause to arrest the

person without going through any other procedure?

6

MR. FORD:

My understanding of the case law

7

elsewhere is that the issuance of a grand jury indictment

8

is sufficient itself to warrant an arrest warrant.

would not be under Washington law.

probable cause for beginning the trial - - is that what an

Information does?

17

You write out on a piece of paper what the facts

18

are, and you say that this is the -- these constitute the

19

crime, and you give it to the judge, and now the judge

20

says yes, we can begin the trial now.

how it works?

It's an allegation, Your Honor, and

Do you need probable cause to begin

So you could bring -- you could

that we can find, and the answer is not because Washington

2

law requires them to, because Washington law says clearly

you can initiate a prosecution --

MR. FORD:

Yes.

You see, I'm bothered by this

slightly odd phrasing of the --of what she swore to.

was that I am familiar with the police report, and the

case contains the following, and it's as if she's vouching

for it but not stating it.

this -- it's a rather unusual animal, and I don't know how

13

to think of it.

14

MR. FORD:

I don't know how to deal with

Well, we haven't got into the facts

15

yet, of course, Your Honor.

Because of absolute immunity

16

it doesn't matter if she made the whole --

No, I know --

MR. FORD:

--or whatever.

QUESTION:

-- and then follow a bunch of factual

20

statements.

What I'm thinking of is this odd way --

21

MR. FORD:

Right.

22

QUESTION:

I mean, she's not vouching for it.

23

She's not even vouching -- I mean, she's not saying she

24

knows it.

25

what she knows.

She's saying it's in the police report.

That's

MR. FORD:

Number 1, I --

2

QUESTION:

I'm trying to work out if that is --

3

QUESTION:

Is that boilerplate?

Is this typical

4

of what goes into a prosecutor's certificate for

5

determination of probable cause, those words, is familiar

6

with the police report, the case contains?

7

MR. FORD:

I don't know the last phrase, Justice

8

Ginsburg.

My experience is that it is fairly typical of

9

both our prosecutors and, of course, of Federal police or

10

law enforcement agents in Federal courts who do the same

11

thing, summarize reports in affidavits, and the Jones v.

12

United States said that hearsay can be the basis of an

13

arrest and arrest warrant, so that is what they're

14

capitalizing upon.

15

But of course here, our submission, and what we

16

plan to prove is that not only was she testifying falsely

17

about what Mr. Fletcher did, but also she's testifying

18

falsely about what's in those police reports, and that

19

will be the question, really, if we get to the question of

20

qualified immunity.

21

If she can say, hey, here's the. police reports,

22

how do I know, we've got a different case, but our

23

contention is that she was false on both levels, and --

If they decide to swear, they're

QUESTION:

Well, suppose they swear that I have

8

read the police report and based on the police report

9

there's probably cause for the following, and then there's

10
11

a police affidavit as well?
MR. FORD:

Well, if they supplied probable cause

12

that did not otherwise exist and did so falsely, they

13

would be the person who is the appropriate defendant, and

14

I would think that that would render them liable.

15

I know of nothing in the common law or any other

16

cases that say that claiming to be a second-hand witness

17

enables you to be absolutely immune, where claiming to be

18

a first-hand witness does not, and oftentimes as long as

19

you're going to allow hearsay there's going to be hearsay.

20

Actually, it's a third-hand witness versus a

21

second-hand witness, but again, Officer Malley was a

second-hand witness testifying to what was in the logs

that he had read from other officers.

It's exactly the

That can't be the difference.

you take on that police function, you take on their

qualified immunity.

but you take on their qualified immunity.

QUESTION:

You're not -- you still have that,

But I thought you said in answer to

5

my question if a prosecutor swears to something while the

6

trial is ongoing,

7

even though it involves swearing, so I thought you were

8

conceding that you could have sworn plus prosecutorial.

9

that would be ranked as prosecutorial

MR. FORD:

It is difficult for me to conceive an

10

instance where the prosecutor could step out of the role

11

and issue an affidavit that was not at least subject to - -

have the immunity of trail witnesses, or she would.

14

The -- if -- but if -- so that's the difference.

15

The difference is the common law difference between

16

complaining witnesses and trial witnesses, and prosecutors

17

never become trial witnesses in my experience,

why I'm having trouble conceiving of that.
