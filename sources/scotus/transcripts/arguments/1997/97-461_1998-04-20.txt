QUESTION:

It arrived by
The analysis --

It was removed, in effect, by the

State.

9

MR. MORIARTY:

It was removed by the State and

10

the employees of the State sued both personally and

11

officially.
QUESTION:

12

Right.

Now, if you're right that the

13

official capacity claims and the claims against the State

14

involve defendants who aren't persons under section 1983,

15

why didn't the State just waive its Eleventh Amendment

immunity?

going to go forward under 1983.

18

waiving the Eleventh Amendment immunity?

I mean, you're perfectly safe.

MR. MORIARTY:

QUESTION:

Did the State consider

Your Honor, there are --

I mean, if you're right, I just don't

this case was prosecuted in Federal court or State court,
they would have been barred.
QUESTION:

Well, would you answer my question?

MR. MORIARTY:
QUESTION:

Did the State waive its immunity?

MR. MORIARTY:
QUESTION:

I'm --

It did not waive its immunity.

But your position is those claims

against -- the official capacity claims and the claims
against the State cannot proceed under 1983 because the
State isn't a person.
MR. MORIARTY:
QUESTION:
end this thing?

That's correct.

Okay.

So why not waive it?

Why not

I just -- it's the strangest posture.

MR. MORIARTY:

We are now looking back, Your

Honor, at -- from the perspective of the Seventh Circuit
decision at the initial removal decision.

At the time of

removal, the claims made against the State were clearly
barred either under Will -- in both State and Federal
court either under Will, because it wasn't within the
definition of a person, or based on Eleventh Amendment
immunity, or sovereign immunity in State court.
The real crux of the case was the individual
capacity claims made against the individual.
QUESTION:

And as to that you wanted it tried in

Federal court, not State court.

MR. MORIARTY:

QUESTION:

3

Amendment immunity?

5

So why not waive the Eleventh

MR. MORIARTY:

4

That's

Because that's not a price of

admission to the Federal court, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

6

Well, maybe it should be.

If we

7

could start all over, it would seem to me to make some

8

sense that if the State removes, that is a waiver of the

9

Eleventh Amendment.

It seems rather odd that you want to

10

go to a court and then say I don't want to be in the

11

court.
MR. MORIARTY:

12

By joining with the officials

13

sued personally in removing, which is required by the

14

removal statutes, the State is not saying we want to be

15

in -- we don't want to be in court.

indicate.

be removed to a Federal court.

You have to consent to the removal.

MR. MORIARTY:

You had

He removed it.
Certainly it was a litigation

decision by all of the defendants joining together, but

the sovereign -- the Eleventh Amendment is a defense.

question.

Is there a substantial Federal question?

2

course there is.
QUESTION:

3

Of

Mr. Moriarty, I remember asking the

4

counsel in the Chicago case that we heard, one thinks of

5

Federal courts as being a place where you can get away

from local prejudice and that sort of thing, but one would

think that the State of Wisconsin would be perfectly happy

to be in the State court.

case.

10

MR. MORIARTY:

I gather that isn't always the

It isn't always the case in

11

individual cases.

For example, we have strictly Federal

12

constitutional claims here.

13

constitutional law that has developed, particularly in the

14

Seventh Circuit, where there's binding precedent on the

15

district courts.

16

precedent on the State courts.

A body of Federal

There would not be that binding

17

If, as a litigator --

18

QUESTION:

What difference does it make, so long

19

as you're going to stand on the Eleventh Amendment?

20

this knowledge that the Federal courts have about Federal

21

law as far as the State is concerned is irrelevant, and as

22

to that, the last piece of this -- I mean, you say we have

23

a right to remand because the Eleventh Amendment is in the

24

nature of a defense.

concerned, as distinguished from the individuals, you --

3

do you concede that the Federal court entertaining your

Eleventh Amendment plea should remand rather than dismiss?

The Federal court had

It is inappropriate for the court to remand

10

claims that are properly before it and that were properly

11

dismissed by the district court through that -- through

12

the full litigation that occurred.

13

QUESTION:

But then I don't understand, because

14

what you're saying by your Eleventh Amendment plea, the

15

Eleventh Amendment not applying in the State court

16

whatever State immunity applies, that you cannot be sued

17

any place, that you are just totally immune, because you

18

do this, you go over to the Federal court and say, Federal

19

court, you can't touch it because of the Eleventh

20

Amendment and dismiss the case, and then no one can touch

21

it.

22

MR. MORIARTY:

Right.

The -- when the Eleventh

23

Amendment applies, generally it's dismissal without

24

prejudice, such that if it --

It's without prejudice.

could do that over and over again.

11

you're a person under 1983, whether you're barred.

12

You

That's -- I could understand your argument

13

better if you said, what we were really trying to do was

14

to get those officers, with their individual capacity

complaints, over into the Federal court.

not going to say we can manipulate the process by

immunizing the State from having any court --

MR. MORIARTY:

Of course we're

trying to do, Your Honor.

So what -- I'm not certain.

Please

correct me if I --

MR. MORIARTY:

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- don't understand the posture of

6

this, but I thought that these -- that the plaintiff has

7

sued the State, i.e. the official capacity ones, and also

8

a number of individuals, and then the whole case is

9

removed to Federal court.

10

MR. MORIARTY:

11

QUESTION:

12

Correct.

And everybody wins, the defendants

won.

13

MR. MORIARTY:

14

QUESTION:

Correct.

All right.

Now, the Seventh Circuit

15

sent the whole case back to the State court, and that was

16

the problem.

Why should it send back the part against the

17

individuals?

Isn't that what was bothering everybody?

18

mean, the part about the State, I would think of course

19

they should send back that claim.

20

I

I mean, that claim, you've asserted the Eleventh

21

Amendment, has no business in Federal court, it's pendant

22

to the others, or it's one claim out of many, and you go

back to State court and try it out in the State court.

However, Your Honor --

MR. MORIARTY:

QUESTION:

Fine.

I thought there are actions against

the State and there are actions against people that aren't

QUESTION:

Now, that's wrong, isn't it?

2

MR. MORIARTY:

It was wrong in doing that.

But is there anything

MR. MORIARTY:

As a matter of jurisdiction, yes.

Why?
As a matter of discretion, it may

not have been.

10

QUESTION:

Ah.

11

MR. MORIARTY:

They turned on jurisdiction and

12

said, there was not removal jurisdiction at the threshold

13

of this case.

14

QUESTION:

Right, so they should have used a

15

different reason.

16

say, well, we decide all the other claims, but the one

about the State itself on official capacity, that's barred

The result might be

the same, but as a matter of discretion, leaving intact

the vital differences between jurisdictional analysis,

QUESTION:

Then you're changing the answer to

8

the question.

Originally you said, no, no, we're saying

9

Federal court.

The only thing you can do with the State

10

is dismiss it, not remand, and now I think in response to

11

Justice Breyer's question, you're kind of saying, well,

maybe not.

have no discretion unless you have authority in the first

14

place.

15

Maybe there's discretion to remand.

MR. MORIARTY:

But you

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg,

tightening that.

On the issue of jurisdiction, do we -- did the

talks, I think quite plainly, about constitutional subject

agree with you.

■y

5

That's what you're assuming and I

But 1447(c) talks simply about subject matter

6

jurisdiction, not original jurisdiction but subject matter

7

jurisdiction, and it may well be that, given the way this

8

Court has construed the Eleventh Amendment, that there was

9

Federal question jurisdiction for 1441 purposes so that

10

the case was properly removed, but once the Eleventh

11

Amendment defense was raised, the court no longer had

12

subject matter jurisdiction within the meaning of 1447(c),

13

and therefore was obligated to remand for that purpose.

14

Would that be a possibility?

15

MR. MORIARTY:

I don't believe it would fall

16

within the 1447 issue because I do believe subject matter

17

jurisdiction in 1447(c) goes to subject matter

18

jurisdiction over the action, not over a particular claim.

MR. MORIARTY:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

because claims within an action are not parceled out in

that fashion.

5

I believe the --

QUESTION:

Well, you just agreed -- I thought

6

you just agreed with Justice Breyer that they could be

7

parceled out in that fashion, because we can split the

8

claims against the individuals, the individual
responsibility claims from the Government claims, so

10

11

you're parceling them out.
MR. MORIARTY:

When we get to the discretionary

12

issue, far from the jurisdictional issue.

13

when we're looking at jurisdiction to begin with --

14

QUESTION:

In other words,

Why can it be parceled when the court

15

is acting on the discretionary power but not be parceled

16

when the court is considering whether it has a mandate?

17

MR. MORIARTY:

Based on this Court's decisions

18

that, for example, in City of Chicago the court had

1

original -- had Federal question jurisdiction over the

20

entire action, over all the claims in the action because

21

of the Federal claims.

22

QUESTION:

But surely it's not your position,

23

Mr. Moriarty, that the Eleventh Amendment is a bar to the

24

claims against the individual defendants.

25

MR. MORIARTY:

Certainly not.

Therefore, it could dispose of the Eleventh

QUESTION:

May I ask why 1441(c) is relevant at

I mean, it seems to me 1441(c) didn't envision the

reason for non-Federal jurisdiction, which we have here?

MR. MORIARTY:
1447(c).

I'm sorry if I misspoke.

I meant

I think that's what we're referring to.
QUESTION:

Ah, okay.

No, I thought there was

15

some discussion about remanding the portions of the cause

16

of action which do not consist of Federal claims to the

17

State court.

18

MR. MORIARTY:

Correct.

1441(c) I did not see

19

as relevant either and did not put in my brief.

20

and 6 cite the portions of 1441(a) and (b) and 1447(c),

21

which I believe to be relevant.

22

QUESTION:

Pages 5

Well, isn't (c) relevant to the

23

extent that it establishes the fact that the district

judge could have sent back -- could have remanded the

25

claims against the State, the official capacity claims?

MR. MORIARTY:

I believe that the 1441(c)

2

addresses an entirely different situation, and involves

3

when there's a separable controversy, when there's not,

4

that type of thing, whereas in this case it's clear we

5

have one single controversy, the firing of the respondent.

6

QUESTION:

Yes, but we have a case, the Coville

case which says that the statute does not preclude a

the statute covers must remands.

It doesn't necessarily

cover may remands.

11

MR. MORIARTY:

That's the central point I'm

12

trying to make, that the -- this decision by the Seventh

13

Circuit was wrong because it looked at what must occur as

14

a matter of threshold jurisdiction, mixed together the

15

discretionary issues, mixed together the Eleventh

16

Amendment immunity jurisdictional issues, and --

your position?

State that are barred by the Eleventh Amendment in Federal

I do not believe they should have

remanded it.

definition and said, we don't have anything here against

the State, and moved to the merits of the appeal.

3

If they wanted to look at Eleventh Amendment

immunity, then they could have said, well, that's fine,

but that comes later in the jurisdictional analysis.

6

QUESTION:

Who do you represent?

7

MR. MORIARTY:

We represent the Wisconsin

individual capacity.

Absolutely.

Fine.

Then I took from your cert

position your basic point -- maybe you're being too subtle

15

about it here, but I took your basic point to be from the

16

cert petition that at least the Seventh Amendment was

17

mistaken in ordering the personal claims sent back, that

18

they shouldn't -- even if they're right about having the

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Justice Souter, I would like to begin by

7

addressing your concern, because I do believe that this

8

case clearly was handled correctly by the Seventh Circuit,

9

because once removed to Federal court the State did

10

immediately assert its Eleventh Amendment immunity, and

11

there certainly the court lacked subject matter

12

jurisdiction.

13

QUESTION:

Well, why couldn't the Federal court

are?

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. LASKER:

I don't think -What's the matter with that?
I think the problem with that,

statutes enacted by Congress that govern this matter.

MR. LASKER:

QUESTION:

5

Your Honor, I -I thought that was where the Seventh

Circuit's decision appears questionable.
MR. LASKER:

Well, Your Honor, I do not agree

6

that the case was properly removed to begin with.

I think

7

that the Court lacked original jurisdiction under 1441(a).

8

I think we have a very unique circumstance here which, as

9

Justice Scalia pointed out, really hasn't been

10

contemplated by the explicit language of any one of these

11

statutory provisions.

12

QUESTION:

This is a situation -Well, I think it fits.

I mean, as

13

long as -- if we don't know if the State is going to

14

assert an Eleventh Amendment defense, and certainly the

15

suit originally filed included section 1983 claims against

16

individuals in their individual capacity, so the whole

17

thing could have been filed in Federal district court as

18

an original proposition.

19

MR. LASKER:

I believe that it could have been

20

filed there only to give the Federal court jurisdiction to

21

determine that it lacked jurisdiction because of the

22

Eleventh Amendment problem extant in the case as

originally filed.

Ginsburg, prior to the decision in this case, but this
