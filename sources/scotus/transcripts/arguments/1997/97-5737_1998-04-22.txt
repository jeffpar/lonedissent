ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH WILBORN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WILBORN:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case raises the issue of whether or not a

10
11

Social Security benefits claimant may appeal a final

12

judgment entered under the fourth sentence of 42 U.S. Code

13

405(g) when that final judgment is accompanied by an order

14

of remand.

15

Now, in Finkelstein, which is cited in the

16

briefs, this Court held that such a judgment is a final

17

judgment which terminates the civil action, and that the

18

agency, not the claimant, may appeal therefrom.

19

In fact, in a footnote in Finkelstein this Court

20

expressly reserved addressing whether or not the claimant

21

had the right to appeal from such a judgment.

22

squarely presents that issue.

This case

23

Apart from Finkelstein, in Schaefer, also cited

24

in the briefs, this Court construed, in the context of an

25

Equal Access to Justice Act claim, the same statute

without qualifying it in terms of whether the

2

petitioner -- the judgment was final for the Social

3

Security Administration only.

4

We believe that the plain language of the

5

statute and the text and structure of the statute

6

established that either party may appeal.

7

look at amicus' brief which was invited by the Court their

8

entire argument, or all of their arguments ultimately loop

9

back to the point or the misconception that petitioner can

10

later appeal any aspect of the instant district court case

11

following the remand proceedings.
In other words, they're trying to tie that into

12

13

the idea that the petitioner is not aggrieved currently.

14
15

In fact, if you

QUESTION:

Well, is it your position that they

could not appeal after the result of the remand?

16

MR. WILBORN:

Mr. Chief Justice, yes, that is

17

exactly my position.

18

the statute is worded that we would have, the petitioner

19

would have the right to appeal the current civil --or the

20

current administrative finding.
QUESTION:

21

Do you lose?

I do not believe that, under the way

that.

Suppose we think this would work

verdict winner.

In this

it then -- sentence 8 of the statute --by the way, the

that.

fees.

Finkelstein runs against that.

Finkelstein this Court chose not to adopt the collateral

QUESTION:

Instead, it

But Mr. Wilborn, Finkelstein could

have been a now or never, as the Court pointed out.

is, if the Commissioner the next time around, in this

8

proceeding where he's hemmed in, makes a determination in

9

the claimant's favor, then he can't appeal from his own

10

That

order.
MR. WILBORN:

11

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,

12

and we believe we are in a similarly situated profile

13

here.

14

Finkelstein might never have the opportunity to appeal

15

that, or would lack standing if they paid benefits on

16

remand, it is possible.

Just as it was possible that the Secretary in

17

Now, it was also possible that the Secretary

18

could have actually denied benefits on remand and then

19

come up to Federal court to relitigate that issue, so it

was possible that the Secretary -QUESTION:

MR. WILBORN:

1

No, Justice Ginsburg.

What I'm

2

suggesting is that even had the Secretary complied with

3

the district court's order in Finkelstein, it is possible

4

that the facts could have still allowed the Secretary,

5

even construing the regulations against their wishes, to

6

have denied the case, and if they had denied the claim in

7

Finkelstein, that would have preserved the issue to come

8

back -QUESTION:

9

Yes, but if, being faithful to what

10

the court says, it comes out that the claimant wins, then

11

the Secretary is stuck and can't appeal.
MR. WILBORN:

12

That's the possibility, and I

13

believe that's why we have a similar situation here.

14

is possible --

16

QUESTION:

It

Why is it that you think you cannot

appeal from an adverse decision after the remand?
MR. WILBORN:

17

Mr. Chief Justice, the reason we

18

believe we cannot appeal from an adverse decision

19

following remand is because this section, 405(g), sentence

20

1, which grants jurisdiction to the district court to

21

review the final judgment of the Secretary, or the

22

Commissioner now, expressly limits the subsequent review

23

in light of Finkelstein saying, this civil action, the

24

judgment, the sentence 4 judgment terminates the civil

25

action.

It goes back on remand, and we must then file a

so when we come back up with a second final agency-

QUESTION:

9

least to me from the statute.
QUESTION:

10

That's by no means self-evident, at

Why -- let me ask you the question

11

this way.

12

district court action in the first appeal might simply in

13

effect be held in abeyance till you go through your second

14

civil action and appeal and if you're not satisfied there,

15

at that point you can take everything up.

16

Why might it not be that your appeal from the

If you win on your first claim, then we forget

17

what happens in the second civil action.

18

your first claim,

19

error, the court of appeals goes to see whether there's

20

any error in effect based on what happened on remand.

21

Would that be possible, or does Finkelstein

If you lose on

then we go to see whether there's any

stand in the way of that?
MR. WILBORN:

Justice's question.

Perhaps it does.

QUESTION:

That's what I think, too.

2

MR. WILBORN:

So if we take -- take as an

3

example the case we have before us, Forney.

4

that she stood in the posture under the facts of her case,

5

that the facts justified the district court taking the

6

grant of jurisdiction under section 405(g) to reverse

7

without a remand.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WILBORN:

We believe

Right.
From a legal -- based upon the law

10

of the circuit.

If that is true, but she goes back on

11

remand to do whatever the administrative agency does on

12

remand, which was not specifically defined by the district

13

court's remand --

14

QUESTION:

It's a new action --

15

MR. WILBORN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WILBORN:

It is a new action.

Okay.
So the current civil action

18

terminates.

19

and the Commissioner both, or one or either of us,

20

introduce new medical evidence, new vocational evidence.

21

That changes the entire factual posture of the case.

22

We then go back, we perhaps introduce -- we

Suppose we lose on remand.

Then we come back up

23

through the appellate -- the administrative agency to

district court under sentence 1 of 405(g), which is set

25

out at page 2 of our opening brief.

Sentence 1 grants

jurisdiction to the district court to review such

2

decision, the new decision.

4

We have to file a brand new civil action.
Unlike --

5

QUESTION:

Okay, but is the reason that the old

6

decision is not then also still subject to review a timing

7

question, that the time for taking the appeal on the first

8

one has simply run so that we can't think of it as just

9

sort of sitting out there in abeyance?

10

Is that the

reason?
MR. WILBORN:

11

I don't believe that is the

12

reason, Justice Souter.

13

because we have a final judgment which terminates the

14

civil action, if we don't appeal that and we go back to --

15

for additional proceedings on remand, what we end up with

16

is a brand-new case that comes up.

17
18

QUESTION:

I think the reason is that

Okay, but it's Finkelstein that says

definitively this is a final action.

19

MR. WILBORN:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

So basically your argument comes

21

down -- I think comes down to the fact, look, you, Supreme

22

Court, decided Finkelstein.

do, is to follow through consistently on it and, if you

24

do, I win.

25

That's all I'm asking you to

That's basically -- is that right?

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

That's absolutely correct.

Yes, okay.

Could I ask you this:

if I recollect

correctly the Government takes the position in this case

8

that although you're entitled to appeal, you need not

appeal.

-- Justice Scalia.

From what you've just said, I gather

it's now or never.

16

MR. WILBORN:

That is under the current state of

17

the law, because under sentence 8 it says that our

18

judgment is appealable, as in any other civil action, and

19

in any other civil action if we don't appeal --

But you don't think it's very

QUESTION:

Not if we stay with the strict
It's --

Well, if there are in fact two

reasonably plausible ways of interpreting this statute, it

10

seems to me that, as the amicus points out, the result of

11

your approach is going to produce a lot of appeals to

12

courts of appeals that are very fact-specific and might

13

result in no better for your client than going back to the

14

agency and perhaps getting the relief there on the basis

15

of the remand order.

16

MR. WILBORN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe

17

that that likelihood is very probable, for the reasons set

18

out in the brief.

19

as they have extended the offer they simply don't hold

20

against the claimant who chooses not to appeal.

21

But in addition, if the Government does

If they don't hold collateral estoppel in an

22

offensive fashion against the claimant, then the claimant

has a freer mind to make the rational choice, do I appeal

or do I not.

I didn't get it earlier.

preclusion doctrine is not something the court ever

interjects on its own.

MR. WILBORN:

QUESTION:

I must say that

It's something that you can plead

That's correct.

So that the Government is kind of

7

saying, we're not going to plead it because we don't want

8

all these appeals.
MR. WILBORN:

9

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.

10

It is an affirmative defense that if the Government

11

chooses to waive, as apparently they have done, that only

12

benefits claimants, and it would -- if there is any danger

13

of this opening the floodgates after Finkelstein nearly

14

8 years ago said this was a possibility, and then after

Schaefer pretty much affirmed that, and then in the Tenth

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BLATT:

10
11

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There are two requirements that must be met for

13

a party to appeal a district court's judgment under

14

section 1291.

15

second, the party must be aggrieved by the judgment.

16

I'd

First, the judgment must be final and,

As to finality, this Court concluded in both

17

Schaefer and Finkelstein that under the fourth and eighth

18

sentences of section 405(g) a district court's order of

19

remand is a final judgment.

20

As to aggrievement, the district court's

21

decision is partially favorable to petitioner to the

22

extent that it sets aside the Commissioner's decision and

23

it remands for further proceedings, but that judgment is

24

unfavorable to petitioner to the extent that it denies her

25

the outright reversal that she seeks, and that's a greater

form of relief.
Therefore, because petitioner is not a fully-

2

3

prevailing party she's aggrieved by the district court's

4

judgment and has a statutory right of appeal.
QUESTION:

6

Is there on that question -- just

remind me of what is basic civil procedure.
Imagine there were no agency involved in this

case.

I'd like an injunction that tells him not to

So what the judge says is, only damages, and in

14
15

the day, so I got some but not all.

Is there any doubt

that I could appeal this on the ground I didn't get

everything I wanted?

MS. BLATT:

Right.

Well, in our -- and it is

These are

1

we're simply talking about preclusion doctrine, it's in

the Government's control.

3

The question I think Justice Breyer meant to

4

raise was not issue preclusion or claim preclusion, but is

5

there something in the finality doctrine, once you give it

6

this final label, that gets the court into the act,

7

something that the court would raise on its own, where a

8

court would not raise preclusion doctrine on its own?

9

MS. BLATT:

Well, courts have raised preclusion

10

doctrines on their own, and it may be they're concerned

11

about finality.

12

But what I'm trying to communicate as a

13

practical matter, if the claimant simply goes back on

14

remand and loses, the four issues that are right now on

15

appeal in the Ninth Circuit could be raised again in the

16

district court and the district court might reject them

17

saying, well, I already considered that and I'm not going

18

to change my mind, and that's probably what's going to

19

happen, but petitioner would have every opportunity on

appeal to the Ninth Circuit after remand to reargue the

21

merits of this that were rejected by the district court.

22

QUESTION:

But what wouldn't -- I think the way

the court would get into it, willy nilly, the Government,

It doesn't look very final to me.

AS AMICUS CURIAE BY INVITATION OF THE COURT

7

IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

8

10

MR. SNYDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The petitioner here won a judgment in the

11

district court that remanded the case back to the agency,

12

where she has the opportunity to obtain all of the relief

13

that she originally sought.

14

We believe that under those circumstances, where

15

the district court granted her, in fact, the relief that

16

was one of the alternative prayers for relief in her

17

complaint, that under those circumstances she is not

18

aggrieved by the district court judgment.

QUESTION:

How is it any different than the run-

MR. SNYDER:

4

The key difference, Justice Breyer,

5

we believe is that in the normal case that you posit there

6

has been a final decision from which there is no further

7

proceedings, other than in the court of appeals.
QUESTION:

8

Right.

That's what I thought, too,

9

but now we have a holding that this remand business, when

10

you remand to an agency, unlike maybe some other remands,

11

it does count as a final decision of the district court

12

for purposes of an appeal, and once you have that holding

13

which,

14

that -- though your brief is very good, and you're an

15

amicus, and I appreciate your work, but isn't that the end

16

of it?

I take it,

is a holding of this Court,

MR. SNYDER:

17

isn't

We do not believe it is the end,

18

Justice Breyer, because while the judgment is arguably

19

final, and we can talk about the meaning of Finkelstein

20

further,

21

be viewed as a final judgment, that does not, we believe,

22

resolve the question of whether under this statute, which

23

opposes an additional limit on appealability -- the

24

statute says that the judgments under 405(g)

25

except that they shall be subject to review in the same

that accepting Finkelstein as requiring that this

are final,

1

manner as other judgments in other civil actions, and

2

those standards that are applicable to other civil actions

3

include, we submit, the appellate standing doctrine for

4

which we've cited --

5

QUESTION:

But Mr. Snyder, why couldn't in the

6

same manner mean in the same mode, like, I have 30 days to

7

file a notice of appeal, or 60 days, or whatever it is?

8

Why doesn't manner just refer to the procedural thing?

9

MR. SNYDER:

Well, we certainly agree that it

10

includes the examples that you gave, Justice Ginsburg, but

11

it doesn't seem by its language to limit it to particular

12

procedural requirements.

13

It says it's subject to review in the same

14

manner as other judgments, and we think that the Roper

15

case that was cited from this Court and numerous other

16

cases have made clear that the appellate standing doctrine

17

is one of the doctrines that is looked at in all cases to

18

be sure that an appellant in fact is aggrieved, and that

19

someone should not be appealing a decision, whether it's a

20

final decision or a nonfinal decision, unless they are

21

aggrieved.

22

And here, what is perhaps unique about this case

23

is that under this statutory scheme you have a judgment

24

that is labeled final, but in this situation, which is a

25

very common situation under this statute --we understand

They can only obtain it after the remand.
QUESTION:

9

They can't obtain it today.

Mr. Snyder, suppose we had a

11

remand order the Government wants to appeal, we know it

12

can.

The Government could appeal, right?

The Government's position is, we were right.

QUESTION:

MR. SNYDER:

This

No remand.

Yes, ma'am.
Could she cross-appeal, then?
Not under the circumstances of this

18

case, where we think she lacks standing, and we think that

19

that's not such an anomalous result as suggested by the

20

Solicitor General's brief, because, for example, in cases

21

dealing with remands to agencies in a typical APA-type

22

case, that is normally not a final, reviewable decision.

23

But there is a line of cases such as Occidental

24

Petroleum v. SEC, and some other cases we've cited, that

25

provide an exception where the Government can appeal the

remand if the matter is otherwise not susceptible to

2

review by the Government, and that is actually the

3

Finkelstein holding in an analogous situation.

4

So a so-called one-way right of appeal, where

5

only the Government can appeal today, but the claimant has

6

to wait and appeal after the remand, is a rule that is in

7

place today with regard to administrative agency cases

8

generally.

QUESTION:

Not a very efficient way to run a

10

show, is it?

11

you might as well hear everything.

12

I mean, if it's up there for one purpose,

MR. SNYDER:

Well, I think that the alternative,

13

which is suggested by both the petitioner and the

14

respondent, is extremely inefficient in the sense that

15

there are 4,000-and-some remand decisions every year from

16

this agency.

17

We know that as a statistical matter, 60 to 65

18

percent of those cases results ultimately in a decision

19

after the remand in favor of the claimant.

20

claimants to appeal and clog the Federal courts with

21

potentially thousands of additional appeals when the

22

claimants can get the same relief faster, we submit, by

23

simply going through the remand process --

or for that matter the Government's brief didn't cite a

2

lot of cases involving other agencies.

3

I mean, we've had judicial review of

4

administrative action for a long time with respect to

5

hundreds of agencies and, in fact, those proceedings often

6

result in a remand to the agency which does not give the

7

claimant as much of a correction of the agency's action as

8

the claimant would like.

MR. SNYDER:
QUESTION:

Do you have --

The main difference --- would you expect a whole bunch of

cases involving this issue.
MR. SNYDER:

Well, I don't believe that a

13

decision here is likely to affect the broad array of such

14

cases, Justice Scalia.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SNYDER:

Why?
Because in the Administrative

17

Procedure Act in the normal situation of a review of an

ruling that you have in this case.

MR. SNYDER:

Absent -- in most cases I think

it's not if they remand, Justice Scalia.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. SNYDER:

Do you have cases to that effect?
Well, the Occidental Petroleum case

6

I mentioned cites scores of cases that say that in a

7

typical review of an agency action the claimant, or the

8

person challenging the agency action cannot appeal when

9

there's been a remand, but there's an exception sometimes

10

for the Government.

11

QUESTION:

In other words -But you're saying that they're not

12

aggrieved, and I'm puzzled, like Justice Scalia is.

13

seems to me that we hear cases from, say, the D.C. Circuit

14

all the time where they've remanded but the legal theory

15

is contested.

I'm simply saying that with regard to the

20

they were not aggrieved.
MR. SNYDER:

I am -- our principal argument in

3

today's case, with regard to this claimant, is that she's

not aggrieved.

5

a final decision, because under 405(g) and under

6

Finkelstein, at least arguably, and the Ninth Circuit

7

held, that this is a final decision.

8

9

We are not arguing today that there's not

QUESTION:

But sticking with the aggrieved,

isn't she aggrieved because the wrong legal theory was

10

adopted, just as in the routine case where we take cert,

11

say, from the D.C. Circuit after it remands to an agency

12

and it comes up here first?

13

MR. SNYDER:

Well, typically the Court -- this

14

Court does not, I believe, typically take review from a

15

circuit court if there's been a remand decision except

16

where the Government seeks review because it otherwise

17

would not be able to obtain review of the issue.

18

In other words, if a claimant wins in a court of

19

appeals and wins a remand for a new agency action, I do

20

not believe this Court has -- I'm not aware this Court has

21

ever accepted a cert petition from a winning petitioner,

someone who challenged an agency action and won.

MR. SNYDER:

1

Well, if the remand offered them

the opportunity, on remand, to win all of the relief that

3

they were seeking, then I would argue that review would be

4

inappropriate.
But to come back to the issue in this case, we

know that here, the Ninth Circuit has held this is a final

decision, so you do not have the typical issue that you

have on most APA cases.

She can still get what she sought from the

She cannot get what she

What she sought from the district court was a

MR. SNYDER:

Well, we agree partly with the

Government.
We definitely agree she's able to file an

11

appeal, and any issues that she lost in the first go-

12

around which become pertinent in the second proceeding,

13

preclusion principles the Ninth Circuit held, we think

14

correctly, preclusion principles would not prevent her

15

from raising those on the second appeal, given our

16

position that she doesn't have the right to appeal now.

17

However, the Government takes the view that she

18

does have the right to appeal now and typical preclusion

19

principles we think require that if someone forgoes an

20

available appeal, then they are precluded.

21

So our position is that applying straightforward

22

preclusion principles and applying the appellate standing

doctrine to this case, as the Ninth Circuit did, results

24

in a very simple conclusion and that is, she is not able

MR. SNYDER:

there may not be an opportunity for the Government ever to

MR. SNYDER:

And the -- Mr. Chief Justice, the

key distinction, we think, between that case and all these

7

other cases and the kind of situation we have here is that

8

in this case we believe, under the appellate standing

9

doctrine -- not finality issues, but appellate standing,

10

the claimant is not aggrieved because at this point she

11

has received not only the alternative relief she asked for

12

in her complaint as a matter of pleading, but she also has

13

received an opportunity to get every dollar of benefits

she wants.

Unlike hypothetical where someone gets damages

remand, when there's more evidence in the record.

MR. SNYDER:

Well, if the subsequent decision

2

were based on legal rulings from this earlier case we

3

think they could be reviewed later, but if -- I

4

understand, Justice Stevens, your question to be, if

5

there's simply a new record --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SNYDER:

Right.
-- and the facts are different in

8

the new case, then I agree that the courts would review

9

the new record based on the record as it then stands, and

10
11
12

that's not uncommon.
QUESTION:

No, but it could be more -- less

favorable to her, that's all I'm saying.

13

MR. SNYDER:

14

QUESTION:

It could be.

Well -She might have just exactly what she

15

wants in the record now, and she thinks as a matter of law

16

she's entitled to prevail now, but when more evidence goes

17

in it might not be quite as clear.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Which is what is going on here, if I

understood counsel's presentation correctly.
MR. SNYDER:

I don't really think it is what's

21

going on here, Justice Scalia.

If you review the

22

appellate briefs of petitioner in the court below, as well

23

as looking carefully at what she alleges are the errors as

24

she's filed her papers here, she is arguing basically

25

legal errors by the district court.

She's saying that as a matter of law there were

1

2

mistakes in the phrasing of hypothetical questions, in the

3

credibility determinations -- she's not simply saying,

4

lack of substantial evidence.

She's raised legal issues.

That's a good point, so why wouldn't

After all, the case was remanded.

Well, in a case -- this Court's

So I think there are some situations where the

21

Government never could get review of the issue that it

22

seeks to raise because the remand proceedings will wash

out the legal issue.

would point out on the issue of cross-appeals that

typically a -- an appellant can defend the judgment on any

2

grounds that would allow for support of the judgment, so

3

even if technically on the appeal of the second decision,

4

even if the claimant can't file a cross-appeal, they in

5

most cases could defend the judgment on other grounds and

6

therefore have their opportunity to raise their issues.

7

QUESTION:

Now, do I -- what you said just

8

before this, do I understand it to be your position that

9

in these cases -- you know, I mean, she's only gotten half

10

of what she wanted, but the Government has only gotten

11

half of what it wanted, and the Government may win when it

12

goes back, just as she may win when it goes back.

13

Do you assert that the only reason the

14

Government can appeal in these cases is if and when the

15

Government would have no other opportunity to raise the

16

question?

17

We have to look into that in every case?
MR. SNYDER:

No, Justice Scalia, because this

18

Court's decision in Finkelstein held to the contrary.

19

This Court held that the Government can appeal these cases

20

and it didn't require a showing of --

MR. SNYDER:

QUESTION:

for the other side?

7

MR. SNYDER:

Finkelstein -Why should the rule be any different

Finkelstein only decided the issue

8

of finality, Justice Scalia, with reference to this

9

statute.

It did not address appellate standing.

10

So we are prepared to assume, for purposes of

11

this argument, as did the Ninth Circuit, that this is a

12

final decision.

13

Finkelstein.

14

differently, but --

15

QUESTION:

One could debate the meaning of

It actually could be interpreted

Well, you can't have it both ways.

16

Either Finkelstein decided the question I asked you, or it

17

didn't decide the question I asked you.

18

You told me that Finkelstein decided that the

19

Government can always appeal, despite the fact that it may

20

get what it -- that it may not be aggrieved, that it may

21

get what it wants on remand.

22

that.

23

MR. SNYDER:

24

QUESTION:

25

You said Finkelstein decided

Yes, sir.
But then you go on to say,

Finkelstein only decided finality.

What is it?

MR. SNYDER:

1

I -- let me try to be clearer,

2

Justice Scalia.

Finkelstein decided, based on finality

principles, that the Government can appeal because it's a

final decision.

MR. SNYDER:

appellate standing.

QUESTION:

Well -Finkelstein simply did not address

Oh, it didn't address appellate

So you then take the position that in some

10

cases the Government won't be able to appeal either,

11

unless you can show that the Government cannot otherwise

12

raise the point it wants to raise.

MR. SNYDER:

QUESTION:

MR. SNYDER:

district court are the claimants.
MR. SNYDER:

2

That's correct.

The Secretary

apparently does not have the right to appeal his or her

own decision to the district court, but I take Justice

I agree that the issue of appellate

standing has never, to my knowledge, been raised with

regard to a Government appeal to a circuit court in

this --

17

QUESTION:

But once the decision has been held

final for purposes of the Government's dissatisfaction,

19

what other issues might come into a question of whether

20

the Government has appellate standing that have not

21

already been subsumed in whether the decision is final for

22

purposes of the Government's ultimate right to appeal it?

23

I mean, you're saying there was a decision about

24

finality, so that at some point the Government could

25

appeal it, but I mean, we're -- I assume,
53

for example,

1

we're not talking about attorney's fees here, so what else

2

might the Government have to show to provide appellate

3

standing that it had not also shown in order to get the

4

determination that it was final as to the Government?
MR. SNYDER:

5

If someone were arguing that the

6

Government was not aggrieved by the decision, then

7

obviously, if the Government could show that there was an

8

issue of law that couldn't otherwise be reviewed, they

9

would most clearly be aggrieved.
But I take your point, Justice Souter, that one

10
11

could argue that in any case the Government ultimately

12

might win on the remand, and I think that's an issue that

13

the courts simply haven't addressed.
QUESTION:

14

I guess I come back to the point that

15

Finkelstein is terribly, terribly subtle if it was

16

reserving the point of aggrievement.

17

MR. SNYDER:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

I don't believe it was reserving -It's a rather misleading case, I

guess.
MR. SNYDER:

Justice Souter, I don't -- I'm not

21

asserting that it reserved that issue.

It simply hadn't

22

been raised, wasn't addressed, wasn't considered, I would

23

submit, and obviously one could read Finkelstein as

24

opening up the doors and saying that both sides can appeal

25

every one of these cases.

1

We simply submit that would result in hundreds

2

and perhaps thousands of needless appeals where, at least

3

as to the claimant -- I'm not sure as to the Government,

4

but at least as to the claimant we know that she has the

5

opportunity to get complete relief on remand.

6

actually less expensive --

7

QUESTION:

But wouldn't claimants' attorneys

8

appreciate that, too?

9

something like 60 percent of them -- if there's a remand,

10

12

What was the figure in the brief,

60 percent of them end up getting benefits?

11

MR. SNYDER:

Yes, ma'am, between 60 and

65 percent.

13

QUESTION:

So wouldn't -- whether there is that

14

second opportunity or not, wouldn't many attorneys say,

15

look, save the money?

16

MR. SNYDER:

I'm sure many would.

On the other

17

hand, many would like two bites at an apple and take the

18

view that, let's try the appeal and we'll get the remand

19

later.

It's hard to predict.
