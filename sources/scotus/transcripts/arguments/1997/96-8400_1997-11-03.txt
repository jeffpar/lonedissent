CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Ronald J. Angelone.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD T. ZERKIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ZERKIN:

9
10

11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Douglas Buchanan was sentenced to death by a

12

jury entirely uninstructed as to those fundamental Eighth

13

Amendment principles which could have saved his life.

14

Indeed, neither the word mitigation, or anything related

15

to mitigation, ever crossed the judge's lips.

16

There are only a couple of Virginia inmates who,

17

like Douglas Buchanan, have been sentenced to death and

18

have preserved challenges to the absence of mitigation

19

instructions.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Zerkin, is the instruction given

21

here typical of the instruction that is routinely given in

22

Virginia in these capital cases, or is it different?

23

MR. ZERKIN:

Justice O'Connor, it is -- it was

24

somewhat typical.

There is now recently, as of about

25

1993, a Virginia model jury instruction which is more

1

expansive and has a definition of mitigation in it.
It came about from a case called Stewart v.

2

3

Commonwealth in which the trial judge gave an expansive

4

mitigation instruction, and the Virginia supreme court did

5

not rule on whether that instruction was proper because it

6

had been given.

7

which was really not very much more expansive, would have

8

been duplicative of what was given, but the model jury

9

instructions now have that -- the instruction from Stewart

10

in the book.

11

Buchanan's trial.

It did say that a further instruction,

That did not exist at the time of Mr.

QUESTION:

12

What is the specific test that you

13

say we must employ in determining whether these

14

instructions necessitate overturning --

15

MR. ZERKIN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ZERKIN:

Your Honor --- the sentence or the trial?
Yes.

It's our position that the

18

instructions must reasonably accommodate the dual interest

19

that this Court has discussed -QUESTION:

20
21

Well, but what's the test that we

employ?
Now, I had thought -- and you correct me if I'm

22

23

wrong.

I thought the test was, is there a reasonable

24

likelihood that the jury applied the instruction in such a

25

way that the jury was prevented from considering

constitutionally relevant evidence.

2

MR. ZERKIN:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ZERKIN:

5

Your Honor, that is -Is that right?
Well, I don't think that that's the

test that applies here --

6

QUESTION:

Why?

7

MR. ZERKIN:

-- because there's no instruction,

8

at all on the issue of mitigation.

MR. ZERKIN:

QUESTION:

If there were -- the

relevant evidence.

15

employed.

Now, I thought that was the test we

16

MR. ZERKIN:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ZERKIN:

The Court has -Right or wrong?
In other contexts, right, and the

19

reason I say other contexts, and it's critical here, or

20

it's significant here, I think in fact we pass that test

21

as well, and I will discuss that, but that arises in cases

22

such as Boyde v. California, in which the question is

23

whether or not the instructions are expansive enough to

24

allow for consideration of all of the mitigating evidence.

25

Here, there's an instruction that violates Gregg

1

in that it provides absolutely no guidance and doesn't

2

discuss mitigation at all, and at the same time -- but at

3

the same time violates Lockett, because what the judge --

4

what the trial judge says is, I will instruct you as to

5

what the law is that you should consider.
He says it repeatedly, and a number of jurors,

6

7

including those who sat in the case, under oath testified

8

that they would accept the instructions and follow the

9

instructions that the judge gives.

The judge then, having

10

said that, is now absolutely silent about the concept of

11

mitigation.
In addition, the instruction that's given --

12

3

QUESTION:

Well, the judge says to the jury, you

4

are to consider all of the evidence that comes in at

5

trial.

6

MR. ZERKIN:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.
And certainly there was evidence that

8

came in of a mitigating nature.

9

MR. ZERKIN:
QUESTION:

20
21

There was such.

Yes.
And the judge says, consider

everything here.
MR. ZERKIN:

22

But then what he says is, your

23

decision is, impose life if you find from this

24

consideration of all the evidence that death is not

25

j ustified.

Now, justification sounds a lot more like

1

2

aggravation than it sounds like mitigation.
QUESTION:

3

All right.

It says --

Would your answer be

4

different if the judge had modified his instruction in

5

this respect.

6

of the evidence you may determine that death is not

7

justified, if he had said, after considering all the

8

evidence, including such evidence as you find to be in

9

mitigation, that the death penalty is not justified, would

10

Instead of saying, if after considering all

that pass muster?
MR. ZERKIN:

11

Our position would be that that

12

probably would pass muster and obviously even that wasn't

13

done here.

14

The baseline at best is the instruction that's

15

set forth in the footnote of the first Zant opinion, which

16

although the Court didn't rule on it, has significantly

17

more about mitigation than exists here.

18

judge contrasted it with aggravation.

19

about it in terms of mitigation or extenuation.

20

QUESTION:

That is, the
The judge talked

But we're talking about the

21

constitutional minimum, not the model charge, which I take

22

it is a considerable improvement.

23

But what you're saying is, essentially four

24

words were missing.

After the words telling the jury that

25

they were to consider all the evidence, if the judge had

1

said, including the mitigating evidence, those four words,

2

that would have brought it within the constitutional zone?

3

MR. ZERKIN:

On one level, Your Honor, yes, and

4

not on the other level.

The other level is that in

5

Virginia, unlike in Georgia, which was the subject of the

6

decision in Zant, the General Assembly has set forth a

7

specific list of mitigating factors, and that those

8

factors are, under the decisions in Gregg and the decision

9

in Ramos, the factors that the State, representing

10

organized society, believes are most relevant to the

11

sentencing decision.

12

QUESTION:

I thought the jury had to be able to

13

consider any mitigating factors.

14

I'd be worried about specifically reciting mitigating

15

factors lest a defense attorney come before an appellate

16

court and say, the jury got the impression that these were

17

the only mitigating.

If I were a trial judge

18

MR. ZERKIN:

19

Honor, nor is it theoretically.

20

first of all in every State, because every State has found

21

it perfectly able to define mitigating circumstances,

22

including statutory circumstances, and still have a catch­

23

all that avoids that, but in this particular case, Justice

24

Scalia, the defense attorneys proposed a jury instruction

25

that said that this was not an exclusive list, and that

It was not a problem here, Your

1

they could consider any other facts.
QUESTION:

2

But Mr. Zerkin, I think you answered

3

my question, yes, it would have been enough.

4

are now arguing for more, but I think when I asked you,

5

suppose those four words had been included, including the

6

mitigating evidence without a laundry list, that that

7

would have been enough to satisfy the constitutional

8

requirement.
MR. ZERKIN:

9

I mean, you

Well, I have -- Justice Ginsburg, I

10

have two positions on that.

11

general instruction that is correct, but that where, as in

12

Virginia, you do have a declaration of the relevant

13

mitigating evidence, which we have, unlike in Georgia,

14

then that also should be part of the equation.

15

suggest, prevail in --

16

QUESTION:

One is in terms of the

We, I

Well, you're giving very confusing

17

answers.

18

had instructed on Virginia statutory mitigating evidence

19

and that's all.

Let me ask you this way.

Would you be here?

20

MR. ZERKIN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ZERKIN:

23
24
25

Suppose the judge here

Yes.
Suppose the judge had done that.
If he did not include the catch­

all it would be a Lockett violation, clearly.
QUESTION:

And are you saying that he had to

read the list from the statute of the mitigating evidence?

MR. ZERKIN:

1

2

The ones that were supported by the

evidence, it's our position that he did have to do that.
QUESTION:

3

But now, the only -- the only

4

objection that you preserved, as I understand it, was that

5

you requested the judge to charge that in several

6

instances a particular kind of evidence was mitigating

7

evidence.

Is that right?

8

MR. ZERKIN:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

No -You didn't ask for a definition of

mitigation.
MR. ZERKIN:

At every stage of the proceedings,

12

from the trial on, counsel for Mr. Buchanan has argued

13

that they were entitled to -- that he was entitled to --

14

QUESTION:

Are you -- I'm talking to you about

15

what instructions you requested.

16

of the proceedings from the trial on, are you answering my

17

question, or are you framing it differently?

18

MR. ZERKIN:

When you say every stage

No, I think I'm answering the

19

question, Judge.

At trial, for example, at pages 74 and

20

75 of the joint appendix, instruction (A)(B) said, in

21

addition to mitigating factors specified in other

22

instructions you shall consider the circumstances

23

surrounding the offense, the history and background of

24

Douglas Buchanan, Jr., and any other facts in mitigation

25

of the offense.

So beginning at the trial level and carried all

1

2

through the proceedings Mr. Buchanan has maintained the

3

fact that he was entitled to an instruction that included

4

this .
Now, we're not here to prescribe what the

5
6

instructions should be.

7

absolutely nothing, and he -- whatever he's entitled to,

8

he's entitled to more than nothing.
QUESTION:

9

What we're here to say is, he got

Well, but if the test is as I

10

articulated it, is there a reasonable likelihood that the

11

jury was prevented from considering the evidence, the

12

answer to that may be no, because the judge said you will

13

consider all the evidence.
And there's one other factor that you haven't

14
15

talked about here.

Both the prosecutor and defense

16

counsel argued to the jury that they should consider, of

17

course, the mitigating evidence, so is there a reasonable

18

likelihood under those circumstances that this jury was

19

prevented from considering evidence in mitigation?
MR. ZERKIN:

20

Yes, Your Honor, because the trial

21

attorney, the -- excuse me.

22

repeatedly I am the one that's going to instruct you about

23

the law.

The trial judge said

picture and what was argued to the jury.

2

MR. ZERKIN:

3

QUESTION:

But -And there is no question, is there,

4

that both the prosecutor and the defense counsel told the

5

jury, yes, you're going to consider these -MR. ZERKIN:

6

Well, actually there was some

7

conflicting argument, because the prosecutor at one point

8

said, you may sentence based upon your own caprice, and he

9

told the jury that they can -- that you may -- you're

10

entitled to consider this.

He didn't tell them that you

5

evidence that the death penalty is not justified, then --

3

Any jury that had sat through 2 days

of mitigating testimony about, you know, the terrible

you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty

MR. ZERKIN:

QUESTION:

10

My goodness, you really think

there's
MR. ZERKIN:

11
12

But --

Yes, because the jury can look at

this instruction and it can say, the question is whether

3

it's justified or not, and there are four victims in this

case, and that's what it's about.

justification.
QUESTION:

said that it had considered the mitigating evidence.

It's about

MR. ZERKIN:

1

The practical difficulty, the

2

reality of trying cases, is that juries make decisions

3

based upon what the -- primarily what the judge

4

instruction of the law is.

5

to assume that.

At least, the system is set up

If they looked at this, and we don't know when

6

7

they looked at it, at the end, after the deliberative

8

process was over, if they looked at this form and they

9

said, oh, this says we're supposed to consider the

10

mitigation, having already made their decision about

11

whether it was justified or not based upon what the judge

12

told them, and that's the first reference they see to

13

mitigation, we can hardly expect that they then go back to

14

the drawing board and start all over again making a new

15

decision about the appropriate sentence based upon a

16

consideration of mitigation.

17
18

So yes, they did -- they signed -- they signed
the form, and they swore that --

19
20

21

QUESTION:

Did any juror, other than the

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that the form

foreman --

22

saying that the verdict was -- was signed at the beginning

23

of the deliberations?

24

MR. ZERKIN:

25

No, Your Honor.

It was probably

signed at the end of the deliberations, that's my point,

1

and therefore they had made their decision.

2

they saw anything from the judge that used the word

3

mitigation they had already -QUESTION:

4

Well, but the foreman is saying that

5

they considered mitigating evidence,

6

is saying they voted unanimously.
MR.

7

ZERKIN:

By the time

just as the foreman

That is correct, and we have

8

absolutely -- because nothing was given to the jury about

9

what mitigation was, or what it meant, or how it was

10

supposed to be used, there was no context for it at all,

11

we have no idea what role that played in the deliberative

12

process.

13

QUESTION:

Well, can we not consider this.

As

14

Justice Scalia -- number 1, we start with a jury

15

instruction that did refer to consideration of all of the

16

evidence in determining what is justified.

17

Number 2, we have, as Justice Scalia pointed

18

out, a trial record in which there were several days of

19

testimony which could only be regarded as testimony

20

intended to be mitigating in the defendant's favor.

21

The testimony came in.

The jurors I assume are

22

entitled to assume that the judge is not allowing in

23

effect irrelevant testimony in.

24
25

And number 3, although we do not allow the
arguments of counsel to substitute for a jury instruction,
15

1

I suppose it is appropriate, in determining whether a jury

2

instruction which would allow consideration of mitigation

3

to be sufficient, to bear in mind that the prosecutor got

4

up and in his own argument admitted that there was

5

mitigating evidence and addressed the question whether the

6

jury ought to find that mitigation adequate.

7

In that total context, instruction that would

8

allow it on its face, number 2, much evidence that came

9

in, number 3, a concession on the part of the prosecutor

10

that there was mitigating evidence, shouldn't we consider

11

all three of those factors in determining whether the

12

instruction here is sufficient?

13

MR. ZERKIN:

Not where the instruction is

14

completely devoid, as in this case, of any reference to

15

mitigation.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

It's the missing word, or the missing

four words.
MR. ZERKIN:

Or the missing concept, and however

19

it does it, that concept must be given the imprimatur of

20

the presiding judge.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ZERKIN:

But it's got to be expressed.
Yes.

It must be expressed, and he

23

must be told that and, indeed, as early as Gregg this

24

Court said that merely giving information under fair

25

procedural rules to the jury is not enough.

(800) FOR DEPO

It would be

1

unthinkable
QUESTION:

2

Yes, but this is more than

3

information.

This is information of a mitigating sort,

4

admitted by opposing counsel to be of a mitigating sort,

5

which could be considered consistently with a jury

6

instruction as mitigating evidence.

7

allowing fact in without any instructional basis for

8

considering it in mitigation at all.
MR. ZERKIN:

9

That's more than just

I disagree with the premise that

10

the jury instruction allows for that, and that's because

11

of the use of the word justification.

12

Well Franklin, as I read it, I --

11

you've probably read it more carefully and more recently,

but I thought that they upheld a Texas instruction that

never mentioned the word mitigation, that the Court

rejected the need to have an instruction that told them

there is a probability he will commit future crimes, and

that was it.

you're dealing --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. ZERKIN:

Why doesn't that -You're dealing with the uniqueness

4

of the Texas statutory scheme, and the standard the court

5

has set up for the Texas scheme is that there must be a

6

vehicle for giving effect to the mitigating evidence.

7

The court decided in Franklin, unlike what it

8

decided in Penry, where it reaches a different result and

9

says it has to be an additional instruction, the court

10

says in Franklin that you may give -- that the aggravating

11

circumstances created the vehicle for discussing with the

12

jury the mitigating evidence, so even though you didn't

13

talk abut mitigation, the unique aspects of the Texas

14

scheme created the vehicle for doing that.

15

That's not at issue here.

We don't have those

16

questions where you could argue age, for example, in the

17

context of talking about future dangerousness or some

18

other -- or deliberativeness.

19

about mental health issues, whether that's a vehicle for

20

it or not.

That is, if you're talking

21

So the Texas scheme is unique, and the courts --

22

and in fact, when the court had to deal with an issue such

23

as mental retardation, where it felt that that vehicle was

24

not provided by the statutory questions in the Texas

scheme, it said it's not enough, and you have to go back

And as I understand it, in fact, Texas has now

The State has addressed it, and we

wrong.

1

circumstance that was not necessary for eligibility, and

2

the Court decided that it affected the weighing process

3

which, of course, is at the selection phase, so the Court

4

has very definitely applied its Eighth Amendment

5

jurisprudence in terms of vagueness and jury instructions

6

to the selection phase as well as to the other phase.

7

And as I've indicated, this rule comes clearly

8

from the roots.

It appears over and over in Proffitt, it

9

appears in Gregg, it appears in Ramos.

In every instance

10

the Court is telling the jury -- and in Penry, and it's

11

telling the jury that mitigation, that this is something,

12

that mitigation matters, and the flaw of instruction

13

clearly must be that that's contained in Zant.

14

Although the Court didn't rule specifically on

15

the Zant instruction, that in any event provided the jury

16

with some guidance as to mitigation, and indicated that

17

mitigation was something that mattered, and under these

18

instructions, the judge -- 2 days of evidence comes in,

19

and the judge says nothing about it.

I will save, unless the Court has other
questions, my remaining time for rebuttal.

MS. BALDWIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think it's very important in this case to

4

understand what issue is before the Court, and what the

5

instructions are that Buchanan asked for at trial, and in

6

this respect, first of all there was never an objection

7

made whatsoever to the Virginia pattern jury instructions.

8

9

Not only was there no objection made, defense
counsel expressly agreed that that instrue -- those

10

instructions should be given, the ones that were given in

11

this case, as well as an express agreeal that the --

12

agreement that the verdict forms as written should be

13

presented to the jury.

QUESTION:

But weren't there additional

15

instructions that were requested and specifically denied,

16

and wasn't there --

17

MS. BALDWIN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I think

18

it's very important to know exactly what those

19

instructions were as far as what this Court has said the

20

Eighth Amendment requires.

21

This is what -- on page 75 of the appendix --

22

this is what Buchanan asked the court for, and this is

23

what Buchanan says the Eighth Amendment requires that

24

juries be instructed, and that is that if the jury --

25

there are four factors which he identified, page 75 and 76

of the appendix, and in each one of those the instruction

2

reads that if the jury finds a particular factor to be

3

present, "then that is a fact which mitigates against

4

imposing the death penalty."
Now, this Court has never held that the Eighth

5

Amendment extends to instructing a jury in a capital

7

murder -- a sentencing hearing that a particular fact is

8

mitigating.
QUESTION:

9

May I ask -- I think you're right in

10

what you're saying, but do you think it would have been

11

error for the judge to give the instruction?
MS. BALDWIN:

12

Under Virginia law, the Virginia

system to say that trial courts should not give specific

instructions on specific factors, because to do so

the error is in not letting -- letting them think they

Virginia rule?
MS. BALDWIN:

Well, because what the Virginia

today, is whether that was constitutionally reasonable.

MS. BALDWIN:

1

That's right, and that is why the

2

Virginia supreme court has interpreted the statutory

3

system to -- such that the courts should not and may not

4

give specific instructions that highlight or single out

5

certain factors which may or may not be mitigating.
QUESTION:

6

What about what I think is a separate

7

argument, a totally separate argument, is not on page 75

8

but on page 74, and in instruction (A)(B) what he does is,

9

he asks the judge in a separate matter that was separately

10

refused simply to tell the jury that they can consider

11

anything in mitigation growing out of the person or the

12

crime.
Now, I take it his basic separate argument is

13
14

that he asked the judge in that instruction, not the ones

15

you quoted, to consider -- just consider mitigation, and

16

there was nothing else in the other pattern instructions

17

that told him that.
So if your argument is he hasn't properly raised

18
19

the question he's trying to raise, I'm slightly stymied,

20

because it seems to me he has in instruction (A)(B) on

21

page 74.

My argument is, that is all that

isn't he in section (A)(B) raising the point he wants to

make, which is that the judge has to tell the jury

something about mitigation, because (A)(B) is very

generally phrased.

12

what is your response to that specific point?

It refers to nothing specific.

important issue for this Court to decide is, this is a

It is here

1

And to do that, what we have to do is look at

2

what was done in the case and the rulings that were made,

3

and were those constitutionally reasonable, and on that

4

score we have, I believe, a strong argument that

5

considering what this Court has said the Eighth Amendment

6

required in capital sentencing hearings in 1989, when the

7

Virginia supreme court decided this case, 1990 when it

8

became final, or even today, clearly the Virginia supreme

9

court rule and the instructions that were given fell well

10
11

within constitutional parameters.
What this Court has made very clear is that

12

there are only two requirements from the Eighth Amendment

13

as far as capital sentencing hearings, and one is that the

14

class of persons eligible for the death penalty in the

15

first place has to be narrowed and, secondly, that the

16

jury not be prevented from considering any evidence,

17

relevant evidence in mitigation.

18

This Court has never held that specific

19

instructions need to be given to a jury considering the

20

sentencing hearing and, in fact, has said over and over

21

that States are free to structure and shape what types --

22

what the procedure is going to be in the hearing.

Virginia triple narrows for the class of eligibles,

I think unlike any other State that I know of.

In Virginia, in the guilt phase we can't get a

capital murder unless it is a premeditated murder and

unless it is a premeditated murder coupled with another

circumstance, such as in this case, the killing of more

than one person in a single transaction.

finding one of two additional aggravating factors.

because they don't have the system that we have.

5

Boyde I think it's very important to look at, you're not

6

only looking at this instruction, because even if the

7

Court believes that there is some ambiguity in the

8

instruction, and I don't believe there is, but even if the

9

Court does, under Boyde there's no possibility that the

10

jury in this case believes that it was prevented from

11

considering mitigating evidence.
QUESTION:

12

Well, on that particular point, I'm a

little bit concerned, because what the prosecutor said in

and I'm not going to tell you anything different because

that's not the law, and that's what the prosecutor said

over and over.

Plus at the very end of the prosecutor's

rebuttal closing argument, he read the jury verdict form

to the jury, and in that jury verdict form is where it

says, where the jury certifies that it considered

Those words must be

The court doesn't have to define them, but it has

But there has never been a ruling

that a State court has to use a specific word, even the

word mitigation.

Mitigation is a lawyer word.

QUESTION:

But it is used now.

I mean, at least

that model charge that we've been hearing about.
MS. BALDWIN:

Yes.

There -- it has been

13

incorporated in it now, but under the instructions that

14

Buchanan's jury were given, they were absolutely

15

constitutionally reasonable.

16

What the jury was told is, consider all the

17

evidence, and then in their verdict form they were told,

18

you have to certify that you considered all the evidence

19

in mitigation, and then you have both attorneys arguing

20

not just that they have to consider mitigation, but

21

telling the jury what mitigation was, and describing it to

22

them in great detail in general sense and in a statutory

23

sense, and this is a jury that knew how to ask questions,

24

too, because in the guilt phase they came back and asked

25

for a definition of a particular instruction.

It was conceded by both sides what their duty

The prosecutor said

I mean, this was -- there was no question in

this case, much less a reasonable probability, that the

jury took these instructions that they were given and then

10

somehow believed when they went back to the jury room

11

after hearing that, the prosecutor's argument, and after

12

reading the instructions, and after listening to 2 days of

13

evidence, that somehow they were precluded from

considering the evidence in the defendant's favor that he

The issue of -Answer -- I think that can be

I think the answer to that is no,

19

that it was not specifically -- that that was not

specifically raised.

discuss it, to describe it, to give the statutory

that the difficulty here was that nothing was done, and

2

that the Court had -- if he didn't like his jury

3

instructions, understanding there was no model jury

4

instruction at the time that dealt with mitigation, if you

don't like the ones that I've done, do one yourself, come

6

up with the issue, and you know, do something with

mitigation.

It was raised in the Virginia courts throughout,
and the Virginia court in the State habeas proceeding

10

ruled that when we raised it, we were raising the same

11

claim that had been raised on direct appeal.

12

the rule of the case Hawks v. Cox, which is that we dealt

13

with this on direct appeal, it was raised, it's preserved,

14

and in that we raised all -- the failure to mention

15

mitigation and all of those issues.

16

They applied

So that's come up all along, and in the cert

17

petition at pages 19 to 20 we raised -- the issue that we

18

talked about was the failure to do anything in reference

19

to mitigation, so that issue has in fact been put before

20

every court that's looked at it, and the Virginia supreme

21

court recognized when it came up on State habeas that it

22

was exactly the same thing that had been presented before,

MR. ZERKIN:

At the bottom of 19 it talk -Yes.
It talks about, absent any

QUESTION:

6

On the meaning of mitigation and what

7

kinds of evidence comprise mitigation, which I think goes

8

to the same point that you raise in question 1 of the

9

question presented, that the specific mitigating

10

circumstances, the statutorily defined ones, were not the

11

subject of the instruction.
MR. ZERKIN:

But as Justice Breyer pointed out,

13

also in that question is that, despite counsel's request

14

for such instructions, and where the jury charge is devoid

of any reference to mitigation.

one of the verdict forms recites the fact that they have

found an aggravating circumstance.

circumstance, so the --

QUESTION:

The other verdict form

So what you raised -- I'm trying to

6

be favorable to you in this question, because I want to

7

see if you -- and so don't let me be too favorable, but I

8

take it you'd raise the fact that the instruction, perhaps

9

because of the word or, or without it, or it didn't

10

mention it, is a zero, and since it's a zero, there's

11

nothing about mitigation and you have to say something.

12

MR. ZERKIN:

13

QUESTION:

14

That's correct.

We have argued --

And in your calling it a zero, did

you talk about the word or, or not?

15

MR. ZERKIN:

I don't think we talked about the

16

word or.

17

instruction was devoid of any reference to mitigation.

18

The difficulty that we have with the verdict

19

form is that you have -- it exacerbates the problem of

20

confusing mitigation with aggravation, because what it

21

says is, once you find an aggravating circumstance you

22

then -- the only choice you have, the only place that's

recited is in the first verdict form, and that verdict

form provides one possibility, and that's death.

MR. ZERKIN:

it, we have that additional problem that the aggravating
