CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in Number 97-6270, Gerald Caron v. The United States.

5

Spectators are admonished do not talk until you

6

get out of the courtroom.

We will wait just a minute, Mr. Walker.

The Court remains in session.

MR. WALKER:

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF OWEN S. WALKER

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALKER:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

14

If a person is pardoned or has civil rights

15

restored, the statute at issue says his conviction is

16

considered a predicate conviction under Federal firearms

17

law only if the pardon or restoration of rights expressly

18

provides that he may not ship, transport, possess, or

19

receive firearms.
My client's -- when my client's rights were

20
21

restored, Massachusetts law told him that he could possess

22

rifles and shotguns and, indeed, possess a handgun in his

23

home.

24

sentence for possessing the very firearms that

25

Massachusetts law told him that he could possess.

He's now serving an additional 12 years on his

1

We say it's self-evident that the statute --

2

that it cannot be said that Massachusetts expressly

3

provides that he could not ship, transport, possess, or

4

receive firearms.

5

QUESTION:

Of course, if we accept your

6

interpretation of the law it wouldn't matter that the

7

firearms he had were the kind that Massachusetts allows

8

him to have.

9

didn't allow him to have he would not be subject to this

Even if he had the kind that Massachusetts

MR. WALKER:

That is the -- what the statute

12

literally says, and it is the --we contend the only

literal reading of the statute.

15

client is concerned.

16

18

QUESTION:

If the Court chooses to

What is the literal reading?

Would

you go through that again?
MR. WALKER:

The literal reading is that if

19

20

pardon says you can have no firearms, only if a pardon

21

says no firearms can the conviction be considered a

22

conviction.

This is -- he was not told no firearms.

QUESTION:

He wasn't pardoned, was he?
I beg your pardon?

QUESTION:

2

MR. WALKER:

Was he pardoned?
No.

His situation is a restoration

3

of civil rights, Your Honor, but the analysis is the same.

4

The so-called --

5

QUESTION:

That's where I'm having trouble,

6

because I read this statute -- I'd always thought that a

7

felon in possession of a gun was committing a Federal

8

crime.

9

Then when I read this statute, the words civil

10

rights restored, I discovered that 24 States restore civil

11

rights virtually automatically, so in half the country it

12

isn't a crime, unless, of course, in those States, and

13

they are a random set thereof, that have some other gun

14

law of their own for their own felons.

15

And so we have about -- I found about, like 11

16

or 12 of them anyway that seem to say, your rights are

17

restored automatically, they're never taken away, as soon

18

as you get out of prison, and by the way, you can have

19

guns, so there, I guess, there is no such law.

20

And then another set, about 11 say you can have

21

some guns and not other guns, and I guess that's what we

22

have here, right?

23

MR. WALKER:

24

QUESTION:

25

honestly do not know.

That's correct.
So how do we deal with this?

I'm very interested in your -5

MR. WALKER:

1

Well, I would suggest that the

2

Court should follow the words of the statute.

The statute

3

does not say that a conviction remains a Federal predicate

4

if there are firearms that the pardon, the restoration of

5

civil rights, expressly provides the person can't have.
It doesn't say that the conviction remains a

6

7

predicate if the pardon or restoration of rights restricts

8

firearms privileges, and it would have been very easy for

9

Congress to say those things.
QUESTION:

10

I don't think it has to be read that

11

way.

I mean, you're taking the literal meaning.

12

it just prohibits his not possessing handguns.

13

handguns firearms?

14

MR. WALKER:

15

QUESTION:

16

Suppose
Aren't

Well, that's -So in prohibiting handguns it's

prohibiting his possession of firearms.
MR. WALKER:

17

There is a false syllogism in the

18

circuit court's reading of the statute, and it goes like

19

this .

20

Let's say you like lawyers.

You like almost all

21

lawyers, but A, B, and C are particular lawyers that you

22

don't like, so the syllogism that is false goes like this.

23

I do not like A, B, and C.

24

Therefore, I do not like lawyers.

25

A, B, and C are lawyers.

It comes out completely the opposite of the

like lawyers, but if you follow that logic, you end up

3

with almost a contrary meaning.

The statute says no firearms.

The fact is, you

It does not say no firearms.

QUESTION:

18

So you misstated the statute.

19

For

MR. WALKER:

So you have to be very, very careful.

Well, I beg to differ, Your Honor.

20

If the Governor told her staffer, draw up the pardon for

21

Smith, and I want it to expressly provide that Smith

22

cannot ship, transport, possess or receive firearms.

23

The staffer goes and writes those words and also

24

adds -- staffer, let's say, likes hunting and says, but

25

the person can have rifles and shotguns to go hunting.

1

So the Governor is looking the next day through

2

her papers, is about to sign the pardon, and she looks

3

down and says, what's this about rifles and shotguns.

4

told you to draw up a pardon that expressly provided that

5

Smith couldn't ship, transport, possess or receive

6

firearms.

7

It's perfectly clear what that means.
QUESTION:

Let me take your lawyers example.

8

isn't perfectly clear.

9

some, in all of these examples.

Suppose, with lawyers,

someone says, I have been cheated by lawyers.

MR. WALKER:

13

QUESTION:

It

It could mean all or it could mean

10

Does that

That -- that -I have been cheated by A, B, and C,

14

and wouldn't I make the statement, I've been cheated by

lawyers?

there's no prohibition in that.

You just said we can't have candy, and that's true.

It doesn't work.

It doesn't work

even for a prohibition.

4

Suppose you prohibited your child from eating

gumdrops, and someone asks you, have you ever prohibited

6

your children from eating candy?

7

yeah, on one occasion I prohibited them from eating

8

gumdrops.

9

from eating candy.

Gumdrops are candy.

MR. WALKER:

10

Wouldn't you reply,

I have prohibited them

You would say there's certain candy

11

that I prohibited my child from eating, but if the

12

question is, have you ever expressly told your children

13

not to eat candy, the answer would be no, if you've only

14

limited it to M&M's.

QUESTION:

I wouldn't say no.

I'd say, on one

occasion I told them they couldn't eat gumdrops.

Then we know that he

MR. WALKER:

Other people can't have handguns on

the street unless they get a special license.
QUESTION:

11

Yes, but as I understand it, under

12

Massachusetts law ex-felons can never be equated to people

13

who never committed a crime because there's always a

prohibition.
MR. WALKER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's

18

clearly weighs heavily on our side, deference to State

bothering innocent-minded people -QUESTION:

Yes, but deference I don't think

3

really -- assuming that was the intent, I don't think that

4

gets you where you want to go, because they could defer in

5

either of two ways.

6

They could say, if the State legalizes it, it's

7

okay with us, or they could say, this is a very dangerous

8

situation, and unless the State wants to legalize it

9

across the board and equate the convicted felon with the

10

person who has never been convicted, we're not taking any

11

chances and we're going to treat the felon as a felon.

12

In either case, the Congress would be deferring

13

ultimately to a State determination, but in one case you

14

win, in one case you lose, so deference isn't going to win

15

the case for you.

16

MR. WALKER:

I disagree, Your Honor.

I think

17

first of all they aren't -- certainly aren't deferring to

18

the 12 or -- 11 or 12 States that make the distinction.

19

What they're saying is, we'll defer to you -- if

20

you want to ban all guns, Federal law -- for ex-felons,

21

Federal law will coincide.

firearms, Federal law will coincide.

2

There's no room for the Rule of

Lenity here, then.

3

MR. WALKER:

QUESTION:

Well, there's -- I do not think -Rule of Lenity, I assume, is a

It says, if there is ambiguity, then, in

fact, we will apply the Rule of Lenity.

I agree, Your Honor, completely,

but I do think the Government's attempt to come up with a

18

different interpretation of the literal interpretation is

19

very strange, this question about there's four verbs in

20

the statute rather than only one; that suddenly changes

21

the whole meaning of the statute; that's why the First

22

Circuit was right; they didn't realize it, but it was

23

because there were four verbs there.

means absolutely none, and that's not what we have here in

2

Massachusetts.

3

I'll grant you that.

The trouble with that analysis, and the trouble

4

with saying therefore plain meaning governs in your favor,

5

is that it leads to a crazy result which I find it very

6

difficult to believe Congress could have intended, because

7

it -- I mean, it leads to the result of saying that the

8

fact that Massachusetts draws a line, and we are referring
to Massachusetts law at least for some purpose here, the

10

line is nonetheless irrelevant.
And it seems to me that it is the strangeness of

11
12

that result which it is very difficult for me to believe

13

that Congress could possibly have intended.

14

Massachusetts says, rifles are okay but no machine guns,

15

the fellow possesses a machine gun and Congress would have

16

meant to say, machine guns are therefore fine.

hard to accept.

The ordinary person is going to say, that's not

That's a nice technical reading.

2

to ask whether or not the State is treating this felon as

if he's now like everybody else or whether he isn't, so if

4

you pardon him, you assume he's back in the group of

5

people that are like everybody else.

6

the same, en masse, with the civil rights restoration.

7

We wiped it out, and

But it isn't wiped out -- it isn't wiped out,

8

and he's not like everybody else, if that wiping out had a

9

condition attached, which condition was, we're not

10

treating you like everybody else in respect to firearms.
And now, if that's the purpose, what's the

11
12

point, either in the pardon case, the expungement case or

13

the civil rights case, of insisting that the States say,

14

oh, we're really not treating you like everybody else

15

in that you can't even have cannons, atomic bombs, all

This trustworthiness rationale that the Sixth

not work.

That is not necessary to be reinstated to one's

Under the minority view, which is what the
petitioner has supported here, a past State conviction

11

prohibits its felons from possessing the kind of gun that

12

the felon is caught with in the present --

13

QUESTION:

Well, the fact that there are these

14

differences of opinion may point in the direction of

15

suggesting that the language is ambiguous, and therefore

16

we have to apply the Rule of Lenity.

17

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Well, in our brief we've

18

noted that there are two possible grammatical ways to read

19

this language, but one of them is not what petitioner

20

proposes here.

21

A conviction either counts as a conviction for

22

purposes of Federal law or it doesn't.

The inquiry under

23

section 921(a)(20) turns on whether a State has restored a

24

felon's civil rights and, if so, whether it has continued

25

to impose restrictions on his firearms possession.

If that is the case, then the conviction remains

a conviction with respect to any firearms that the felon

may possess in the present.

under the felon-in-possession statute, section 922(g),

that a felon may not possess any firearms.
QUESTION:

in saying that you're following State law and yet -- this

State law, and yet he's being prosecuted as a felon in

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

11

Well, Federal law requires a

12

court to look to the law of the convicting jurisdiction

13

for its purpose, and everyone acknowledges that, but the

14

purpose is to determine whether or not that convicting

15

jurisdiction has continued to give the conviction effect

with respect to firearms, and that is the only respect in

which Federal law defers to State law in this context.

It's just deference in one particular.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

That is correct, and it's

21

important to remember that even under petitioner's

22

position there are a variety of contexts in which Federal

23

law would criminalize the possession of a firearm by a

24

felon where a State law would not.

2

no matter what Massachusetts does to restore his civil

3

rights for his Massachusetts convictions, and no matter

4

what Massachusetts says with respect to his firearms

privileges, he still remains a felon in possession for

6

purposes of Federal law.
QUESTION:

7

Yes, but not for sentencing under the

8

three-strikes-you're-out proposal, because if the

9

Massachusetts convictions don't qualify then he'd be

10

sentenced differently.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

11

Well, I think that the fact

12

that this case arises as a 924(e) case dealing with the

13

recidivism sentencing provision, merely serves to

14

emphasize why this reading has to be correct.

15

implausible to believe that Congress would want the

consistent with the statutory text, and this statutory

2

text cannot be read to turn on what kind of firearm a

3

felon happens to possess in the present.

4

Returning back to the fact that this is a

section 924(e) proceeding, it's very unlikely, we believe,

that Congress would want the recidivism inquiry to turn on

whether petitioner brought a rifle or a handgun to the

Well, Mr. Nuechterlein --

QUESTION:

Your example assumes not just

13

application of the Rule of Lenity, but also rewriting of

14

the statute pursuant to the Rule of Lenity, because even

15

if you applied the Rule of Lenity, that doesn't -- that

16

gets you to the point where it wouldn't matter whether he

brought a shotgun or a short gun, it would --he would

simply be able to have all firearms or be able to have no

firearms.

20

That is to say, even if he had a firearm that

was forbidden by the State, if you take the reading given

by petitioner, even if he brought a handgun, which the

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

The implausibility on your side, though, it

becomes a trap.

Congress wrote that statute having State law in mind as

relevant for some purpose, nonetheless assuming that even

though State law says you can have the single-shot .22,

7

you follow State law, you do what is lawful under State

law, and you still get caught under the Federal statute.

That turns State law into a trap, and that seems to me the

I find it implausible to believe that

10

source of the implausibility for your all-or-nothing

11

reading.

12

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I disagree for two reasons.

13

One is that there are many circumstances in which both

14

State and Federal law address the same subject matter

15

under criminal law, and a person is assumed to both know

16

about and to comply with both, but more importantly, under

17

any interpretation of the statute, and that includes

18

petitioner's, there will be a broad range of circumstances

19

in which Federal law would criminalize what State law

20

expressly permits, and this is an example of such a case.

Massachusetts convictions it would still remain the case

his right to possess firearms, he would still be barred

under Federal law from possessing them.

QUESTION:

effect, through the use of the Massachusetts scheme as a

pitfall, or as a trap for him.

7

Federal law would

But this is not a case where State -- I mean,

8

the argument here is not a case where Federal law is

straightforwardly saying no.

Federal law is making a

10

reference to State law.

11

then Federal law in effect says, well, on one all-or-

12

nothing grammatical reading, that isn't good enough.

13

That's a strange scheme when you're dealing with convicted

14

felons.

15

State law says it's okay, and

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Well, Federal law in our view

16

does, in fact, expressly prohibit possession of a firearm

17

by a felon if the convicting jurisdiction has not -- or

18

has continued to give effect to his conviction in a manner

19

that relates to firearms.

20

QUESTION:

In any way.

21

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

But even in Massachusetts,

22

even if you look only at Massachusetts, then there are two

23

additional circumstances under which the Federal law

prohibition will be broader than the State law prohibition

For example, he committed a Federal felony in

Massachusetts tells him about his firearms privileges, he

prohibition, and there's also --

Notwithstanding anything that

QUESTION:

But he has to commit a felony, and he

7

would say, well, you know -- and in the circumstances of

8

this case I don't feel too sorry for him, because it's

9

just a question of how much of a penalty he gets for a

10

later felony that he committed, but the statute also

11

covers a case where he hasn't committed any later felony,

12

and he's just following the State law which says, you may

13

now possess long guns, and suddenly he's guilty,

14

nonetheless, of a Federal firearms offense.

15

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Justice Scalia, if Congress

16

had wanted simply to track in every respect the State law

17

prohibition it would have been very easy for it to have

18

done that, and it didn't.

19

But the more important point is that even if he

20

only had one felony conviction and that felony conviction

21

was in Massachusetts, there is a 2-year window after which

22

Massachusetts restores some of its firearms privileges but

23

does not restore his civil rights.

24
25

There are jurisdictions that restore firearms
privileges before civil rights, and even with respect to

1

those jurisdictions the Federal prohibition still obtains.

2

There's still -- because we have a two-step inquiry it's

3

inconceivable that Congress meant to defer to State law in

4

every respect.
QUESTION:

5

Why wouldn't -- I mean, I don't

6

understand what Congress was driving at.

That's what I --

7

and the reason is, as Justice Souter was saying, is it's

8

plausible Congress could have meant, once the State

9

decides to let these previously convicted felons carry

10

some guns, Federal law jumps out of the business and we

11

leave it up to State law, and he'll be punished if he's

12

carrying the kinds of guns he shouldn't and he won't be

13

punished if he's carrying the kinds of guns he should.
I mean, that's a possible reading of the

14
15

statute, in which case the anomaly of him being able to

16

carry anything, even if the State lets him carry some

17

things, is no longer anomalous.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

18
19
20

Right.

It's important,

though -QUESTION:

So that's a possible reading.

What I

21

can't get at is, what was Congress up to?

I mean, as I

22

said before, it seems to me that with this word civil

23

rights they've sort of taken this statute away from half

24

the country, and then when you start looking to how these

25

24 States get back into it there's a whole nightmare of

different rules and regulations as to when some guns can

2

be carried and you can't carry others, et cetera.

3

So what was Congress doing, in other words, if

4

it didn't mean to take the Federal Government out of the

5

business entirely in respect to prior felons if the State

6

was willing to let those prior felons carry some guns?

7

What other purpose could Congress have had?

8

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

It's important to remember

9

the historical backdrop against which Congress legislated.

10

Up till 1986 it was always a felony for a felon to possess

11

firearms if he had a State conviction for a felony,

12

notwithstanding anything the State had done to restore his

13

rights, either monolithically or partially.

14

Congress then began in this legislation with the

15

presumption that felons are too dangerous to have

16

firearms, but it made an exception in cases where a State

17

has decided not to give continuing effect to the

18

conviction for purposes of civil rights for firearms

19

privileges, and that is the bright-line rule that Congress

20

imposed here, and it is a rule of national application.

21

QUESTION:

Am I right in understanding that

22

there was a lot of labor lost, if your interpretation is

23

correct, with all the time that the First Circuit spent

24

figuring out if civil rights had been restored?

25

That was academic.

They should have gone right

and that's the end of it.

QUESTION:

But shouldn't the district court have

gone right to that question?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:
QUESTION:

It was --

Why get into this whole hassle about

11

whether civil rights had been restored if the Federal

12

legislation means so long as the State bars you from

13

carrying any gun you don't come out from this category?

14

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

It was because at the time

15

the district court ruled, the First Circuit law was

16

crystal clear.

17

pardon or restoration of civil rights, then that was the

18

end of the inquiry, so that was the simplest basis on

19

which the district court could have resolved the case, and

20

it was on that basis that the First Circuit then revisited

21

its earlier precedent.

just asked you -- you remember that one?

Yes.

All right.

my view, but suppose the view that underlay that question

2

was right, then I guess when you went back to the history

3

of this statute, they would have not just -- they would

4

have been gutting the prior law, so you would have thought

5

that there would have been huge arguments about it,

6

whether this basic statute, you know, that forbids felons

7

to possess guns was really going to be -- half of it

8

chopped away.

9

There would have been an enormous argument.

On the other hand, on your reading of it, it

10

makes a kind of odd, bizarre, but narrow exception that

11

has weird, jagged edges.

12

lot of debate about that.

13

Very well, maybe there wasn't a
Maybe it went unnoticed.

Well, when you look into this, what was it?

14

What was the debate like?

15

like when they passed this statute?

16

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

17

QUESTION:

I mean, what was the discussion

There wasn't --

Was this meant to be a major change

18

in the statute that really would have eradicated half the

19

statute, or was it meant to be some minor thing?

20

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

No.

In fact, the statute

21

does not reflect a belief by Congress that it was

22

overhauling the Federal felon-in-possession prohibition.

23

Congress was responding to this Court's decision in

24

Dickerson that held that whether something should be

25

counted as a conviction to begin with under -- for

1

purposes of the statute, this Court had held that that

2

question should be held purely as a matter of Federal law.

3

What was at issue there was a State procedure of

4

deferred adjudication, and this Court held that even

5

though the State didn't characterize deferred adjudication

6

as a conviction, that it would be deemed a conviction for

7

purposes of Federal law, so that was -- that, along with

8

situations where someone is given a blanket pardon and his

9

conviction is treated as a nullity, were the two

10

situations that Congress was focused on.
QUESTION:

11
12

How many States are there that allow

ex-felons free access to guns just like everyone else?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

13

States have 50 different

14

approaches to this problem, and I've -- I couldn't give

15

you an exact figure, but I do know that most States do not

16

restore firearms privileges immediately upon release from

17

confinement.

That occurs gradually over time.

18

About half the States --

19

QUESTION:

20

You mean, even for embezzlers and

bigamists?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

21

I think most State statutes

22

are phrased in terms of whether or not you've committed a

23

felony.

QUESTION:

No matter what felony, whether it's a

violent crime or not.

QUESTION:

I'm trying to find out whether this

this provision.

more.

If there aren't States that do that, then I
would resist interpreting a statute to do nothing.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, there are

16

States that do that.

17

for firearms privileges to be restored.

18

The question is how long it takes

About half of the States in the Federal system

19

are all-or-nothing States, such that they either prohibit

20

possession of all firearms, or they permit possession of

21

all firearms after a certain point.

22

Some States, like Vermont, restore firearms

23

privileges immediately upon release from prison. Others

24

take 10 years, 15 years, but there are a substantial

25

number of cases -- there are a substantial number of

States in which firearms privileges are either completely-

withheld or completely restored.

QUESTION:

And in Massachusetts your view is

that no ex-felon -- the Massachusetts conviction will

was 120 months versus 262 months?

MR. WALKER:

Is that what we're --

The maximum would have been 10

years, that's correct, Your Honor, so the add-on because

of the fact that he did what -- well, because of the
