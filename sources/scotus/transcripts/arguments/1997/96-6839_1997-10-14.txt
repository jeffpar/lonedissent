ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER M. FLEURY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FLEURY:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Title 8, section 1326(a), provides for a 2-year

12

maximum penalty if these facts are proved:

13

deportation, and 2) a reentry without a deport -- without

14

permission.

15

1) a

Title 8, 1326(b)(2), on the other hand, sets a

16

punishment of up to 20 years if these facts are proven:

17

1) a deportation, 2) a reentry without permission, and 3)

18

an aggravated felony conviction which occurred prior to

19

the deportation.

20

The issue presented is, did Congress intend for

21

1326(b) to be a sentence provision or a separate offense?

22

The starting point, of course, is the plain

23

language of the statute.

There are three very important

24

factors which plainly indicate that subsection (b)

25

incorporates by reference the conduct described in

1

subsection (a) rather than setting forth the sentence for

2

a conviction in subsection (a).
The first phrase that helps us is 1326 (b) .

3

It

4

says -- is in 1326(b) which says, in the case of any alien

5

described in such subsection, and then it says, in that

6

case if the person has a prior aggravated felony, he'll be

7

facing a 20-year maximum.

8

It specifically does not say, in the case of any

9

alien convicted in such subsection and, as this Court said

10

in the Sedima case, when Congress intended that the

11

defendant had been previously convicted, it said so by

12

using explicitly words like convicted or conviction.
Here we have no such word, so what subsection

13
14

(b) does is incorporate by reference the conduct set forth

15

in subsection (a), that you have to have a deportation and

16

a reentry without permission.

17

QUESTION:

But you could also say that the

18

person described in subsection (a) shall be fined under

19

title 18 or imprisoned not more than 2 years or both.

20

It's describing that.

21

MR. FLEURY:

22

process, not the person in subsection (a).

23
24
25

That's describing the result of the

QUESTION:

But it's in subsection (a), is it

not?
MR. FLEURY:

That is in subsection (a), but if

1

you take that clause that I just read, the person

2

described in subsection (a), and you add to it the clause

3

that precedes it, where it says, notwithstanding

4

subsection (a), which the Government itself concedes as a

5

must, that that means despite subsection (a), which -QUESTION:

MR. FLEURY:
QUESTION:

No.

What --

Notwithstanding that penalty, here's

another penalty if these facts are -MR. FLEURY:

You have to re-add words to the

statute to get to that result, which is the opposite -QUESTION:

Well, I don't think so.

I mean, I

15

think it's a pretty normal reading, and I think we're --

16

another factor is that the titles to subsection (b) make

17

reference to penalties, and all the amendments to it refer

18

to penalties.

19

I don't know why those aren't indicators for us that this

20

really is a sentence enhancement.

21

They don't refer to a new separate crime.

MR. FLEURY:

First, as to the notwithstanding

22

question, if subsection (b) was to be a penalty or a

23

sentence for subsection (a), it's the opposite word that

24

you would use.

25

You would say, the penalties in subsection (a)

1

are a result of the conviction -- I mean, the penalties in

2

subsection (b) are a result of the conviction in

3

subsection (a), not, notwithstanding or despite the

4

conviction in subjection (a).

5

one would give to say that (b) flows from or is a result

6

of (a).

7

It's the opposite signal

Secondly, as to the word penalty, the word

8

penalty by itself is a very little evidence that what

9

Congress intended was a sentence provision.

Penalty is

10

the word signifying the result that will occur, not

11

whether or not how you get there is through a trial of an

12

offense, or at a sentence proceeding.

13

sentence proceeding are not synonymous phrases.

Penalty and

14

Congress, when they enacted in 1952 this very

15

statute, 1326, before the (b) part was even thought of,

16

enacted it in Chapter 8 of the Immigration & Nationality

17

Act entitled, penalties.

18

statutory provision referred to the 1326(a) as creating a

19

sanction for certain deported aliens.

20

is the way anybody would describe the creation of a new

21

criminal law.

22

The House report to that

The word penalties

If you wanted to pass a law against jay-walking

23

you would say, I want to make a penalty against jay­

24

walking, and you would describe it as such, just as

25

Congress did when they described the car-jacking statute.

1

It was under a subtitle called, enhanced penalties for

2

auto theft, or Federal penalties for armed robberies.
Numerous statutes are found under a heading with

3
4

penalties.

It would be a different thing all together if

5

there was subsection (a), offense, subsection (b),

6

penalty.
In 1988, when Congress passed 1326(b), as the

7
8

Government points out in their brief, the phrase penalty

9

was not added to the statute.

That's just in the

10

codification that you see when you pick up a book.

That

11

was not a congress -- the codifiers added that, not

12

Congress, so the word penalty did not become part of the

13

statute at all, much less -- even if it had meaning as a

14

signal as to whether or not it's a sentence provision or

15

an offense.
And third, in the plain language of the statute

16
17

it would make no sense for the phrase in (b)(1) that you

18

can get up to a 10-year sentence for a felony, and then in

19

parentheses, other than an aggravated felony.

20

that make any sense if that's a sentence -- if that's just

21

a sentence proceeding, because it would just be a

22

gradation.

23

How would

All of the courts below are uniform in looking

24

at a statute and seeing -- if Congress had passed 1326(b)

25

and simply added that language to an already-existing

1

1326(a) right at the end, and just said, shall be guilty

2

of a felony and shall suffer a penalty of up to 10 years,

3

or a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years, and if they

4

have an aggravated felony it will be up to 20 years, or if

5

it's just a felony it will be up to 10 years, that would

6

be a signal that there's a sentence provision for the

7

offense in (a).
But making it a separate subsection is deemed by

8

9

all of the courts that review this as an indicator that

10

it's an offense, especially when it's not section (a)

11

entitled penalties, which it's not.

12

Then when we

13

QUESTION:

I'm not following your argument

14

all -- about all of the courts of appeals, because I

15

thought that the Ninth Circuit is the only one

16

interpreting this statute as established in a separate

17

offense.

18

MR. FLEURY:

My point was that in looking at

19

whether or not something is titled penalties, if it's in a

20

separate subdivision, like in section -- 18 U.S.C. section

21

1091, which says (a), basic offense,

22

basic offense, then that's a signal that (b) is to be a

23

sentence provision.

24
25

(b), penalty for

But where it's all in one section, courts of
appeals have said as to that factor, not the end result

1

but as to that factor, that is an indication, if the

2

penalty provision is in the same paragraph as the offense,

3

then it's a sentence for the offense, but if it's

4

separated out into a separate section without a separate

5

title of penalty, then that's an indicator -- it may not

6

be dispositive -- an indicator that it's meant to create a

7

separate offense.

8

9

Such as in 2113(d), which is the bank robbery
statute, and 2113 sets forth (a) that it's a crime to

10

commit a bank robbery, and you can get up to 20 years.

11

(d), if you use a weapon or assault somebody in the course

12

of committing (a), then it's an extra 5 years, and this

13

Court in the Simpson case assumed that was an element, and

14

even though it was -- it -- just as in this statute

15

incorporated by reference all of the provisions of the

16

previous statute.

QUESTION:

Mr. Fleury, would you go back over

18

your argument about the parenthetical other than an

19

aggravated felony?

suggest anything to me.
MR. FLEURY:

That doesn't

What does it suggest to you?
Well, if it was a sentence

24

provision, then it would just say in gradations,

25

you've got a felony conviction you'll get up to 10 years.

(a), if

1

If it's an aggravated felony you'll get up to 20 years.
But if you put in the word, other than an

2

3

aggravated felony, it takes care of a due process

4

concern -- I mean, a double jeopardy concern.

5

only get convicted under (b)(1) or (b)(2), because a

6

felony could fall under both statutes, but if you add the

7

clause, other than an aggravated felony, then you can only

8

be convicted under (b)(1) and not (b)(2), otherwise

9

there's no sense to having that clause in there.
QUESTION:

10

You could

But you can only be sentenced under

11

(b)(1) or (b)(2) also, under that -- as it now stands, as

12

the Government --

13

MR. FLEURY:

Yes, but there would be no reason

14

to put -- it would -- you could only be -- you can only

15

get up to 10 years if it was a felony and only up to 20

16

years if it was an aggravated felony, with or without that

17

clause, but it does satisfy double jeopardy concerns if

18

you view these as offenses.

19

QUESTION:

But the clause could -- even if this

20

is a sentencing provision the clause is necessary, is it

21

not?
MR. FLEURY:

22

No, it wouldn't be necessary.

23

my client has a felony and they don't prove it's an

24

aggravated felony, he could only get up to 10 years,

If

QUESTION:

1

Well, but the whole point is they

2

want to distinguish between aggravated and nonaggravated

3

felonies for sentencing purposes.

4

MR. FLEURY:

5

QUESTION:

Sure -So you have to have that

6

parenthetical or something equivalent to it in the -- in

7

(b) (1) .
MR. FLEURY:

8

9

I don't think it would be necessary

for sentencing concerns, because again, if it's not an

10

aggravated felony it still -- it's -- if it's an

11

aggravated felony, it would be a felony, and that might

12

raise double jeopardy concerns if these are offenses,

13

which is our view they are, because if it doesn't say

14

other than an aggravated felony, there might -- it might

15

not survive the Blockburger test, so -- but that is not

16

one of our more important points.

17

More importantly, subsequent enactments indicate

18

clearly that Congress viewed these as creating separate

19

offenses.

20

to -- when they created 1326(d), they made it crystal

21

clear, because they say that you cannot contest the

22

validity of a deportation order under certain -- under (a)

23

or (b) (1) .

24
25

In -- when they created 1326(d), they referred

QUESTION:

2

MR. FLEURY:

Because it wasn't in the indictment.
Because it wasn't in the

indictment.
QUESTION:

4

Now, if it had been in the

5

indictment, and given the certainty of the conviction,

6

I -- the defendant would end up with two offenses which

7

would place the defendant in jeopardy of a three strikes

8

and you're out, closer to the three, so why is it in

9

defendant's interest to have this as a separate offense

10

rather than an enhancement?
MR. FLEURY:

11

I'm not -- I didn't understand the

12

question with regard to he would be convicted of two

13

offenses.
QUESTION:

14

In other words, if you -- you take

15

your case.

You say, there are two separate offenses, that

16

merely coming back once you've been thrown out is an

17

offense.

18

MR. FLEURY:

19

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.
And then a separate offense is coming

20

back after you've committed a felony, been convicted, and

21

then been deported.

22

MR. FLEURY:

Subsection (a) would be a lesser

23

included offense of (b) necessarily.

It would not survive

24

the Blockburger test because there's no element in (a)

that does not also exist in (b), therefore only one

conviction could be had, but the value is clear, as the

2

amicus brief indicates, to the defendant.

3

Most of the prosecutions under 1326 are in the

4

Ninth Circuit alone.

5

under this statute are in the Ninth Circuit alone, which

6

covers more cases than all of the other circuits combined.

7

QUESTION:

There's -- 60 percent of the cases

But you're telling me that's for sure

8

that you'd end up -- on your view of the case you can only

9

have the one conviction.

10

MR. FLEURY:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.
And you would not be convicted

12

separately of (a) and (b), so you wouldn't have two

13

strikes against you, only one.

14

MR. FLEURY:

Correct.

I think it's a clear

application of the Blockburger test, and (a)

QUESTION:

is a subset

Can you tell me if in the plea, the

hearings when the judge takes the guilty plea, does the

judge in a case with an indictment like this one, which is

20

unclear as to whether it covers both (a) and (b), does the

21

judge routinely ask the defendant about the prior

22

convictions to get that on the record?

MR. FLEURY:

I don't know.

case, the law in our circuit was clear that -- Vasquez-

1

that I haven't quite thought through is, supposing you

2

have an indictment like this, a colloquy in which the

3

defendant acknowledges he came in, and so forth and so on,

4

and then subsequently the Government learns that there

5

were the three prior convictions before sentencing, and

6

they go into the judge and say, we've just learned that he

7

qualifies under (b) so we want a 20-year sentence.

8

That would be permissible, as I understand it,
under the Government's view, and they wouldn't have to

10
11

prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.
MR. FLEURY:

They'd just --

And they wouldn't have to present

12

it to a grand jury, and I would point out with regard to

13

that, as I said, the Ninth Circuit has the majority of

It does not create a separate

Congress enacted (b)(2) as part of a three-tier

The

statutory text, structure, and history compelled that

13

conclusion, and that interpretation does not create a

14

constitutional problem.
Subsection (a) of section 1326 sets forth the

15
16

offense conduct.

It also sets forth a base sentence of up

17

to 2 years that shall be imposed on such an offender, but

18

specifies that that provision, that you shall be sentenced

19

to 2 years, is subject to subsection (b).
Subsection (b) then states that notwithstanding

subsection (a), longer sentences are authorized in some

cases.

fact that subsection (b) applies notwithstanding

17

Congress was looking at (a), which stated at that time

for Congress to use that language at that time.

I think also I want to distinguish, Your Honor,

The claim is in this case there was a

Do you have any question as to the

validity of the Rule 11 hearing before us in this case?

No, Your Honor.

We was, we

point out in our brief that actually at the Rule 11 it

said 10 years and in fact under the statute could have

been 20 years, but because petitioner's sentence imposed

was ultimately below 10 years there's no problem with

that.

12

QUESTION:

Ms. Brinkmann, isn't the fact that

13

we've had a fairly serious colloquy here about the problem

14

of when enhancements and enhancing factors become so

15

radically important that they perhaps ought to be treated

16

for constitutional purposes have to be treated as changes

of elements rather than merely the addition of sentencing

you, because if we rule your way we're going to have to

decide and I suppose come up with some standard to say

21

when enough becomes too much, and when we in fact pass

22

into a constitutionally suspect area, and we ought to

avoid those kind of rulings if we can.

QUESTION:

Well, it may not arise in this case,

say when it would arise in order to conclude that it

QUESTION:

Well, it's clear that in this

about the possible other cases, and you called my

makes this point:

significance.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, we think that

13

that was simply the statutory provision at issue there,

14

and if there's one thing that we've learned in preparing

15

for this case, there's a wide variety of recidivist

statutes both in the Federal and State system, different

language, different structures, and I'd have to get back

to the Court's opinions in Spaziano and Walton and

Now, is it the case that those reviewed by the

It's captioned penalties, and there's a whole variety of

factors that are sentencing enhancements under that.

13

not just the nature and quantity of the drugs involved,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER M. FLEURY

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FLEURY:

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

The -- in McMillan and in Patterson there was a

6

clear statement that those legislatures attended the fact

7

at issue there not to be an element, and that was a big

8

part of this outcome of both of those cases.
In this case we have no such clear statement,

9
10

and in -- both in McMillan and in Patterson the Court

11

looked to the fact that Congress deemed the -- whether or

12

not Congress had deemed the fact -- the facts that the

13

jury did find to be so important to create a liability for

14

the statutory maximum punishment, and since the jury did

15

find all of those facts, the outcome was within the

16

dictates of the Constitution.

17

Here we have the question left unresolved, and

18

that is whether a fact upon which an additional 18 years,

19

dwarfing the possible consequences to my client other than

20

that resolution of that fact is to be alleged in the

21

indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and here

22

we do not have what was present in Patterson and in

23

McMillan.

24
25

We don't have the type of clear statement from
Congress as they did in 21 U.S.C. 841, where they have

(a), unlawful acts,

2

sets forth a sentence procedure in order to determine the

3

prior convictions that might be used to increase the

4

statutory maximum sentence under 841, where Congress has

5

said as clearly as they could that the prior convictions

6

in 841(b) will be sentence enhancements for a conviction

7

under (a).

That's not present in this case.
The traditional rule is that prior convictions

8

9

(b), penalties, and 21 U.S. 851, which

used to increase a statutory maximum must be alleged in

10

the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

11

Court's never said otherwise.

12

QUESTION:

13

This

In Oyler --

What is the source of your

traditional rule?

14

MR. FLEURY:

We -- in a footnote we cited

15

numerous, numerous cases.

16

law, and that was the rule well into the 20th Century

17

until very recently in statutes like 841 and the like.

18

hasn't changed.

19

brief, the uniform rule.

20

precedents for this are too numerous to cite.

21

the traditional rule.

22

That was the rule at common

It

That was the -- as we pointed out in our
As some of the cases say, the
That was

In addition to this, this is not a recidivist

23

statute.

24

well, if you do something and you do it again you'll get

25

extra penalties.

A recidivist statute is something where it says,

1

2

same thing again for a recidivist statute.

3

MR. FLEURY:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Well, but you don't have to do the

Oh, correct.
So this is a form of recidivist

statute.
MR. FLEURY:

But it requires a prior aggravated

7

felony which occurred prior to the deportation, and it has

8

to do with somebody who reenters with the status of a

9

felon, just like 18 U.S.C. 922(g)

is concerned with the

10

status of the person.

11

deterrence to keep felons away from weapons, and therefore

12

it's an offense for a felon to have a weapon.

13

It says, we want to have increased

Here, we -- Congress said, we want to have an

14

increased deterrence for felons who don't even belong in

15

this country.

16

20-year offense for you to come into this country, and

17

that has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and

18

alleged to the jury.

19

Therefore, it's an extra offense, it's a

In this case we don't have any -- we have no

20

indication that the constitutional right to have a grand

21

jury to decide whether a 20-year offense should have been

22

filed in this case, it did not occur.

23

presented to the grand jury, and that's the purpose of the

24

grand jury right.

QUESTION:

That was not

Is it your view that also all these

things in the drug statute have to be submitted to grand

juries -- amounts?
MR. FLEURY:

3

That presents a much more difficult

4

question at least in the drug cases in 21 U.S.C. 841.

5

do have what was present in Mulaney -- in Patterson and

6

McMillan.

8

You have the clear statement, and so -QUESTION:

Is there a constitutional problem

there?
MR. FLEURY:

10

You

In our -- in my view there is, but

again --

QUESTION:

12

unconstitutional --

13

MR. FLEURY:

14

QUESTION:

So in your view it might be

Yes.
-- to -- and therefore all the

15

amounts would have to be submitted to grand juries and in

16

the indictment, too.

17

MR. FLEURY:

Yes, that is correct, but again --

18

and 21 U.S.C. 841 would present that issue clearly because

19

there is a clear statement that that's what Congress

20

intended.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Th^nk you, Mr. Fleury.

the case is submitted.
