ORAL ARGUMENT OF EILEEN PENNER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. PENNER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For the last half-century this Court has been

11
12

granting writs of certiorari to review erroneous refusals

13

by the appellate courts to allow statutorily authorized

14

and meritorious appeals.

15

fully consonant with the broad jurisdictional power

16

conferred on this Court under the statutory certiorari

17

provision, section 1254, and residually under the All

18

Writs Act.

19

That historical practice is

The statutory certiorari provision vests this

20

Court with the power to review all cases in the courts of

21

appeals over which those courts have jurisdiction

22

regardless of the condition of those cases and

23

irrespective of any decision that the court of appeals may

24

have made.

QUESTION:

1

Well, I think in light of House v.

2

Mayo,

I think it's very hard to argue that there is

3

statutory certiorari jurisdiction unless we want to

4

overrule that case.
MS. PENNER:

5

I submit that Nixon v. Fitzgerald

6

has already called into very serious question the

7

underpinnings of the statutory certiorari decision in

8

House.

9

House suggested that no case could be in the

10

court of appeals if the certificate had been denied merely

11

because the statute prohibited an appeal from entering the

12

court of appeals absent a certificate.

13

QUESTION:

Did the Nixon case discuss the

14

jurisdictional point at length?

15

MS. PENNER:

16

QUESTION:

It did not, but it - Well then, our rule is that

17

jurisdiction that has been assumed without any elaborate

18

discussion is not really to be regarded as contradicting a

19

prior case that did discuss jurisdiction.

20

correct?

21

MS. PENNER:

Isn't that

Mr. Chief Justice, we do not claim

22

that Nixon v. Fitzgerald has even sub silentio overruled

23

House v. Mayo.

Instead, we claim that it implicitly has

1

jurisdiction is assumed sub silentio, without a discussion

2

of the jurisdiction, that simply doesn't count.

3

MS. PENNER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

4

In Nixon v. Fitzgerald the Court made a decision

5

about what section 1254 means, and that decision, its

6

interpretation, is irreconcilable with the holding in

7

House.

8

certiorari decision in House, it would have very serious

9

implications for the scope of the section 1254 power which

10
11

Were the Court to reaffirm the statutory

the Court had recognized in Nixon.
If a case is, in fact, not in the court of

12

appeals when a court of appeals dismisses for lack of

13

jurisdiction, what is left of Nixon?

14

case is in the court of appeals when there is a

We should be -Especially in a case entitled United

20

States v. Nixon, or Nixon v. Fitzgerald, and that's why we

21

have that rule, that where we haven't thought and spoken

our entertaining of the case.

MS. PENNER:

The Court thought very carefully

2

about its jurisdiction in both Nixon v. Fitzgerald and the

United States v. Nixon.

MS. PENNER:

QUESTION:

10
11

In fact, there's much more discussion

That's -House v. Mayo, they didn't even get a

response from the State, as I remember it.
MS. PENNER:

Indeed, that's so, and the petition

for certiorari was written by House's mother.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MS. PENNER:

I - - we submit that even if Nixon

14

v. Fitzgerald and United States v. Nixon are not the best

15

authority for this Court, if the Court is concerned that

16

there was inadequate discussion in those cases, turning to

17

the plain language of the statute alone should be

18

sufficient.

19

it could possibly be, and we submit that Congress' choice

20

of the language in section 1254 was intentional.

21

The language in section 1254 is as broad as

It conferred jurisdiction on the court in all

22

cases, not just all appeals, but all cases, all matters,

23

all judicial proceedings that could occur in the court of

24

appeals and that, by its plain terms, would include

25

proceedings of an original matter in the courts of appeals

such as an application for a certificate of appealability.
QUESTION:

2

Well, what about a motion before the

3

court of appeals to expedite a particular case for hearing

4

before the court of appeals?

5
6

MS. PENNER:

In our view that also would fall

within the plain language.

7

The case in the court of appeals here is the

8

jurisdictional question of whether the court of appeals

9

had the power under section 2253 to decide the merits, to

10

allow the appeal into the court of appeals.
That is exactly analogous to the decision that

11
12

this Court made in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, that the predicate

13

jurisdictional decision to dismiss an appeal for lack of

14

jurisdiction was itself a case in the court of appeals

15

over which this Court has certiorari power under section

16

1254.

17

QUESTION:

But don't you run in there, Ms.

18

Penner, to our cases that say that piecemeal appeals are

19

frowned upon?

20

sort of - - and here you're saying, we can carve out what

21

one -- many people might think was simply one case into

22

two cases.

23

application and the other is the merits.

You know, the final judgment rule and that

One is the certificate of probable cause

But doesn't that just bifurcate things that we
have said in other contexts should not be bifurcated?

3

MS. PENNER:

I think there are two answers, Mr.

Chief Justice.
The first is that, to the extent that there is

4

any bifurcation it's created by Congress itself, which

5

mandated the creation of a gate-keeping provision at the

6

same time that it foreclosed - -

7

QUESTION:

MS. PENNER:

Well --- review of an appeal unless a

certain thing happened in that gate-keeping decision,
10

which is a decision to allow the appeal to proceed, but

11

the second - -

12

QUESTION:

Do you really think that Congress

13

in - - having thought about this thing intended that we

14

have jurisdiction to review a decision of the court of

15

appeals not to grant a certificate of probable cause or a

16

certificate of appealability?

17

MS. PENNER:

In my view, the plain language of

18

section 2253, particularly when compared with the plain

1

language of 2244(b) (3) (E), leaves no doubt that Congress

20

expressly intended this Court to retain the certiorari

21

power it has been exercising for the past half-century.

22

In 2253, Congress prohibited only one thing from

23

entering the court of appeals absent a certificate, and

24

that is an appeal to the court of appeals from the final

25

order in a proceeding under sections 2255 or section 2254.

It does not say anything about this Court's

1

2

certiorari power and that silence is very significant when

3

you consider that that provision was amended at the same

4

time that Congress adopted section 2244(b)(3)(E), in which

5

it expressly proscribed this Court from exercising its

6

certiorari jurisdiction over an analogous gate-keeping

7

provision in the successive petition context, and I

8

suggest that Congress had a very good reason for doing

9

that.
It would have been much more concerned about the

10
11

accuracy of the gate-keeping decision in the first habeas

12

petition context than it would have been in the successive

13

petition context.

QUESTION:

MS. PENNER:

They do, Your Honor.

i

7

QUESTION:

And by hypothesis here we would not

have jurisdiction under the statutory certiorari?

8

MS. PENNER:

9

QUESTION:

By hypothesis here, yes.
So wouldn't it be rather hard to say

10

that that was an aid of our jurisdiction if it was -- if

11

our jurisdiction depended on issuing that writ?

12

MS. PENNER:

It is an aid of the appellate

13

jurisdiction that this Court could exercise over the

14

appeal that the court of appeals has pretermitted by

15

denying the certificate of appealability.

16

This Court has often held that it has the power,

17

even when there is yet no case in the court of appeals, to

18

order a lower court to allow a case to proceed, for

19

example, by ordering a lower court to issue a bench

20

warrant or to decide the merits, or even to allow the

21

record to be transferred to the circuit court of appeals.

22

Each of those things, if they were not corrected

23

by this Court, would end the case, which would otherwise

24

develop into one over which this Court would have

25

statutory certiorari power.

In this case,

1

for example,

if the Court were to

2

reverse through its use of common law certiorari power the

3

holding of the court of appeals that no certificate should

4

be issued, the case would proceed, a decision would be

5

made in the court of appeals, and that case would be

6

reviewable by this Court on statutory certiorari.
Were the Court not to have that power,

7

it would

8

basically be giving the lower courts the power to

9

eliminate its own jurisdiction, which cannot be the case.
QUESTION:

10
11

Well, but maybe that's what Congress

wanted.
1

12

MS. PENNER:

When the Court was interpreting the

13

All Writs Act in - - I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, are you

14

speaking of section 2253?

15

QUESTION:

Well,

I'm speaking about -- of that

16

and whatever else is applicable.

I mean, to say that this

17

particular result would obtain is not necessarily an

18

argument against that result,

19

what Congress wanted.

20

MS. PENNER:

it seems to me,

In my view,

if that's

it's a question of

21

comparing the statutory intent in 1254,

1651, and 2253.

22

1254 and 1651 are extremely broad jurisdictional grounds

23

of power which I believe cannot easily be read to restrict

24

this Court's power in a way that it could not reach a

25

particular judicial proceeding in the courts of appeals

like this one.
The second question is whether 2253 indicates

2

3

any intent to take that power away, and I don't see,

purpose,

ones do not.

about what appeals should be permitted through the gate

are -- that those decisions that the courts of appeals

made are correct, and --

QUESTION:

But the issuance of a certificate of

16

appealability by a justice of this Court could accomplish

17

much the same purpose as you say that accomplishes,

18

couldn't it?

19

MS. PENNER:

In many cases,

it will accomplish

20

the same purpose for the question of individual justice

21

for a single petitioner.

22

For example, Mr. Hohn would, indeed, be

23

satisfied with issuance of a certificate by this Court,

24

but the question under the All Writs Act is whether the

25

issuance of a common law writ is necessary or appropriate

that that is not just the appellate jurisdiction that the

Had Congress indicated an intention

10

to prevent this Court from exercising its common law

11

certiorari power, a slightly different question might be

12

presented, but here there simply is no indication of that

13

in section 2253.

14

It was completely silent on the subject and in

15

comparison with section 2244,

2

Court to perform what is essentially the same function as

3

that which it performs on certiorari through use of the

application process.

5

I - - the Court would be rendering binding

6

decisions on the meaning of constitutional rights that

7

were resolving circuit conflicts in highly developed

8

opinions before the full Court through the application

process, which is highly unusual.

10

I think the Court's practice strongly suggests

11

that that is not its preferred method of practice in the

application --

that the burden is on you if you want to have an - - you

16

17

MS. PENNER:

The All Writs Act speaks of the --

18

a power being - - existing when it is either necessary or

19

appropriate.

20

In this Court's decision in Alkali, it confirmed

21

that that power is available not merely to curb excesses

22

of jurisdiction by the lower courts, but also to force

23

lower courts to exercise their jurisdiction when it is

24

appropriate to do so.

1

for the Court to exercise its appellate jurisdiction

2

through use of the All Writs Act.
It is certainly true that the Court could

3
4

conceivably stretch the application process broad enough

5

to make it so like the certiorari process that it can

6

perform certiorari functions through the application

7

process, but it is unclear why Congress would have

8

intended that.

9

It also is extremely awkward, because it

10

relegates to a single justice -- typically when an

11

applicant submits their application for a certificate to a

12

single justice, it relegates to that justice the

13

responsibility for determining whether the issue raises

14

matters of national importance or a circuit conflict that

15

warrant the full Court's attention.

16

And in contrast, in the certiorari process, all

17

members of the Court have the opportunity to consider that

18

question of whether it is worthy of the full Court's

19

attention.

20

QUESTION:

So you think if we agree with you

21

that you can get a -- you know, a certiorari writ when you

22

do get an application to a single justice, and I probably

23

get more of them than anybody else, I don't have to worry

24

about all of these cosmic questions?

1

QUESTION:

Well, you say that one of the

2

disadvantages of not agreeing with you on the certiorari

3

point is that each justice to whom an application is

4

submitted would have to worry about such questions as

5

establishing what the law ought to be in circuit conflicts

6

and all of that.

7

Whereas I assume the consequence is, the

8

unuttered consequence,

if I agree with you, then I don't

9

have to worry about that any more.

When I get these

10

individual applications, all I have to think about -- and

11

I should never refer, never have to think about referring

12

it to the Court.

13

MS. PENNER:

Surely the burden on a single

14

justice to consider those issues of whether a question of

15

clearly establishes that the petition for certiorari

And,

in fact,

this Court has exercised its power

to use certiorari repeatedly over the last 50 years,

21

sometimes to resolve circuit conflicts, often to define

the scope of constitutional rights, and to make very

important statements about the availability of habeas

that typically an applicant for a certificate will be

QUESTION:

Well, what do you see as the test of

12

a certificate of appealability, Ms. Penner?

13

circuit justice for the Fourth Circuit, ought I to decide

to grant a certificate of appealability only if there's

18

of two ways, before the court of appeals.

MS. PENNER:

I understand Your Honor to be --

20

are you questioning about the standard that the courts of

21

appeals should be applying?

22

QUESTION:

Yes, and I mean, would a justice of

this Court apply the same standard that a judge of the

24

court of appeals applies?

25

MS. PENNER:

The Government has argued that a

1

higher standard should apply, that this Court should only

2

issue certificates in the most extraordinary

3

circumstances.

4

that certiorari review would be available.

They made that argument on the assumption

I -- that argument, that the Court should apply

5
6

a different standard in deciding whether to grant

7

applications for certificates, contravenes the plain

8

language of section 2253 and this Court's own decisions.
Section 2253 expressly sets out a standard.

It

10

is a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional

11

right, and that standard applies equally both to circuit

12

justices and to circuit judges.

13

the court to apply a different standard, I expect that it

14

would have said so.

15

Had Congress intended for

In addition, the Court in Barefoot v. Estelle

16

set out the standard which Congress subsequently codified,

17

and it never indicated that, were a certificate

18

application to be submitted to it, it would apply a

1

different standard and, indeed, circuit justices in

20

chambers appear to have been applying precisely that

21

standard.

22

We do not argue that it would not be appropriate

23

for the Court to require a petitioner to seek relief

24

elsewhere before submitting an application for a

25

certificate to this Court.

It is a rule that the Court

has used in other circumstances, and it furthers the

2

Court's appellate function by permitting it to review the

3

decisions of lower courts rather than to be deciding

4

questions in the first instance.

5

But that is different -- requiring applicants

6

for a certificate to exhaust other remedies first is a

7

different matter than raising the bar and saying that they

8

must prove not merely a substantial showing of a denial of

9

a constitutional right, but also a clear and indisputable

10
11

substantial showing.
One other point is that -- Justice Scalia raised

12

the question of the burden on justices in chambers.

13

availability of petition for certiorari will ease the

14

burden on justices in chambers of deciding applications

15

for certificates, because the Court will have the power to

16

slice through to the single error, the legal error that a

17

lower court got wrong, in this case the question whether

18

Mr. Hohn's claim was the denial of a constitutional or a

19

statutory right.

20

The

A justice in chambers or, in fact, even the full

21

Court, were the justice to refer the matter to the full

to consider all of the secondary issues, for example,

case, and question whether a petitioner has made a showing

of cause and prejudice for their procedural default,

actual in the sense this is a burden that the justices in

chambers will not have to bear if it holds to its 50-year

practice of finding that -- of issuing writs of certiorari

to review the decisions of lower courts on certificates.
QUESTION:

Well, excuse me, could -- but how

7

does that work?

to that one issue, and the other issues could not be

presented to the justice in chambers?

The Court would grant certiorari limited

MS. PENNER:

10

It's true that the Court could

11

combine those two issues, but only if it affirms that it

12

retains the certiorari power.

13

it lacks the certiorari power, the full Court could decide

14

one legal issue and then refer the rest of the case back

to a single justice to decide the rest of the issues,

The United States believes there are two reasons

1

2

that this Court should adhere to House v. Mayo and hold

3

that it may issue a common law writ of certiorari to

4

review the action of the court of appeals in this case.
The first reason is stare decisis.

5

The second

6

reason is that a common law writ of certiorari is the most

7

practical available way to correct important legal

8

questions such as the proper standard for issuing

certificates.
QUESTION:

10

What if Congress had said that, you

QUESTION:

But couldn't one infer from --

2

perhaps not even infer, but the - - part of the holding of

3

House v. Mayo is that we don't have statutory certiorari

4

jurisdiction here.

5

Why shouldn't that be the end of it?

MR. ROBERTS:

It is the Government's position

6

that House was correct and the Court doesn't have

7

statutory certiorari, but the codification of statutory

8

certiorari did not repeal this Court's ability under the

9

All Writs Act to exercise common law certiorari.

QUESTION:

11

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

In aid of its jurisdiction, and --

If we don't have statutory certiorari

13

simply substitute for that to give us jurisdiction?

MR. ROBERTS:

Well,

it's not to substitute for

that to give the Court jurisdiction.

incorrect decision by the court of appeals, keeping the

only basis?

in which the court of appeals denies qualified immunity

appeal?

But I mean,

in logic, if the case isn't in

Why would that be in the court of appeals?
Why would a case in which the court of appeals

6
7

says, we think that you've tried to appeal under a

8

collateral order exception from Cohen, but we think you're

9

wrong, why would that case be in the court of appeals?
Why would a case in which the court of appeals

10
11

ever says we don't think you have jurisdiction to appeal,

12

why would that be in the court of appeals?
In other words,

13

if House v. Mayo is right, how

14

can we take any of those cases?

it's certainly a close

2

is it?

3

House v. Mayo wrong?

Is it a distinction?

MR. ROBERTS:

4

If so, what is it, or is

It's a distinction, and the

5

distinction is that here Congress has set up a two-stage

6

process with a screening mechanism to decide whether

7

petitioner's case is in the court of appeals.

8

It would be odd to consider the application to

9

that screening mechanism to be itself a case that brings

10

the petitioner's case in the court of appeals, so that

11

would be the reasoning in House and in the other cases

12

that consider a leave to appeal not to be in the court of

13

appeals.

14

QUESTION:

Well, in your view, do we have common

15

law certiorari jurisdiction to review the denial of a

16

court of appeal --a certificate of appealability and also

17

jurisdiction to review the merits of the appeal?

18

MR. ROBERTS:

House holds that the Court has

19

jurisdiction to review the denial of the certificate and,

20

if it determines that the certificate was improperly

21

denied, to review the merits.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. ROBERTS:

And that's your position here?
And that is our position here.

24

The Government's position is that this issue was decided

25

in House and that the Court should adhere to House,

1

because stare decisis is particularly strong in cases like

2

this one, which turn on statutory interpretation.
And Congress has revisited all these statutes.

3
4

It's revisited the All Writs Act, the certiorari statute,

5

and section 2253 several times since House, yet Congress

6

has made no changes to any of the statutes that indicate

7

any disagreement with House.
QUESTION:

8

9

Of course, all we have to do, I

suppose, if we accept your view of House, is review the

10

certificate of appealability determination and stop there.

11

We don't have to go the further step, do we?
MR. ROBERTS:

12

No.

In fact, that's why we

13

believe that a common law certiorari is the most efficient

14

means to decide these questions, because in the context of

15

acting on an original certificate, an original application

16

for a certificate, the Court wouldn't be able to stop

17

there.

18

The Court would have to review the entire case,

19

the Court would have to decide all the legal issues that

20

are necessary to determine whether there's a substantial

21

constitutional issue, and the Court would have to apply

22

those legal standards to the facts of the case and

23

determine whether the petitioner is entitled to a

24

certificate on the facts of the case, and that would be a

25

very cumbersome method to achieve clarification of the

Standard for issuing certificates.
There's no reason to believe that Congress

3

intended that.

Congress didn't say that in 2253 that that

4

was the method of review that should be used and,

5

in another provision of the AEDPA, Congress expressly

6

revoked the Court's certiorari power to review orders by

7

the court of appeals that authorize or deny the filing of

8

successive habeas petitions.

in fact,

So Congress was aware of how to limit this
10

Court's certiorari power if it intended to do so, but it

11

chose not to do so here.

12

QUESTION:

Now,

in this Court the petitioner

13

applied to this Court for a certificate of appealability,

14

or at least to a justice, did it not?

15

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

Yes.

And I think that the Government

opposed that on the grounds that the petitioner didn't

MR. ROBERTS:

2

The exceptional circumstances are

not met in the case of a certificate because the

petitioner hasn't demonstrated an entitlement to a

So it's the circuit's practice, but

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

The circuit's practice could

be otherwise -- this Court in In re Burwell held that it

was up to the individual courts of appeals to determine

It's that Congress has set up a

separate process to determine whether the case can go

forward, and has explicitly mandated that unless the

petitioner survives that hurdle, the case can't go

not been used meaningfully in an opinion by this Court

5

It would seem quite anomalous to resurrect the

Court's jurisdiction that is now most expressly regulated

I submit that that's not what happened.

I'd like, Justice Breyer,

to address your

question about -- and the Nixon cases.

11

between the Nixon cases and this one is the gate-keeping

12

decision is really not a jurisdiction decision.

13

ultimately may have jurisdictional consequences, but keep

14

in mind, when a court of appeals judge denies the

15

certificate, that does not mean no jurisdiction.

The key difference

Yes,

it

The inmate can go to this Court, obtain a

certificate --at that point there might be jurisdictional

consequences, but of course at that point the review that

But another critical point here, you know --

I thought that wasn't because of

where it was located, whether in the court of appeals,

MR. SUTTON:

4

Well, Your Honor, since I'm not

getting very far on that analogy, let me try to make

6

another point.
2253 creates another implication that I think

7
8

undercuts the 1254 argument that has been made, and that's

9

the implication created by the fact that when the inmate

goes to a court of appeals judge the game is not over if

the certificate is denied.

can be

referred to the whole Court.

that when you're dissatisfied with what the court of

matter.

What that section says is the term title only

that in 1945 there was no better discerner of the state of

The harder question, I agree with you, is

whether the law was settled as to common law certiorari in

There's one body of Government that would have

make that argument they've looked to a definition they

that definition says, when used in this title, all right.

Since 1948 when the law was changed you've got,

that the statute language allows it, would have singled

which would have let so -- an egregious, really

2

controversial refusal to grant a certificate of

3

appealability that's the kind of thing we might review?

4

You know, the court's really wrong, or it's

5

really controversial, there's a big legal issue involved.

6

Now, out of all the things we review, is there any reason

7

why Congress would have wanted to say, that alone you

8

cannot review?

9

MR. SUTTON:

In other words, are you saying that

10

they would have wanted to preserve the jurisdiction for

11

the rare case, or why would they eliminate --

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

I mean, you're arguing,

13

basically, that out of all the things --we can review all

sorts of things.

And assuming the language allows it,

One of the critical problems that the

The second reason they would have wanted to

if you leave other avenues of review open.

QUESTION:

streamlining review -- doesn't work

The Congress wanted cases deemed

frivolous by lower court judges to cease.

14

MR. SUTTON:

Absolutely, and to be terminated.

15

That's exactly right.

It's not just streamlining review

and making sure it's efficient and that the courts focus

on the claims with merit, but those claims with merit are

done after the inmate has had one fair opportunity before

administrative problems that arise when you've got not

Well, Your Honor, if -- once the

MR. SUTTON:

They act as

understanding, but I had always thought circuit justices

10

act as surrogates for the whole Court, so that they did

11

not take -- keep in mind just their own views of a

particular matter but are sensitive to what other justices

13

may -- how they may view the matter.

QUESTION:

Oh, but I've voted to grant

certiorari when I thought -- or I -- put it the other way.

Court, and I just don't think it would be.

3

MR. SUTTON:

Well, I think the view that there's

4

no loophole is the trust in the Court both as an

5

institution and as its body of nine individual justices.

You assume no one justice will make a

appeals has denied it.

I suppose there's the risk of a mistake even of

Would the practice be any different

MR. SUTTON:

No, Your Honor.

I mean,

it's

something they've been doing for quite a while.

17

This has been something that they've had to manage.

In fact,

Congress was aware, Justice Souter, to get back

19

to your question, of how they managed it and I think the

question of decisions by this Court, where there's no

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EILEEN PENNER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MS. PENNER:

Justice Ginsburg raised an issue

24

not reach but for its certiorari power and that is the

25

question whether, after In Re Burwell, a single dissenting

1

judge on a court of appeals panel, his vote in favor of a

2

certificate is sufficient to mandate that a certificate be

3

issued.

4

That is the sort of question,

the procedural

5

question about issuance of a certificate, that this Court

6

would have no opportunity to review.

7

QUESTION:

Do you think it's vitally important

8

that that be the same Nation-wide, that one court of

9

appeals follow one practice,

10

it would be terrible if the

other followed the other practice?
MS. PENNER:

11

The question is whether Congress

12

did.

13

important procedural issue might arise that this Court

14

would need to resolve, but there may be questions that go

15

to the heart of section 2253 that Congress would want this

16

Court to have the authority to resolve.

17

I cannot imagine all of the situations in which an

There was a point about - - I - - about the state

18

of the law at the time that House was decided, and I - - we

19

21

question that Mr. Sutton has raised and the question about

22

the legislative history is whether the 1925 act retracted

23

the power that the 1908 act had conferred on circuit

24

justices to grant certificates of probable cause.

the part that required direct appeal to the Supreme Court

and that justices retained their power to grant

certificates.

QUESTION:

Do you have any explanation for the

dearth of any applications in that period?
MS. PENNER:

We don't -- I personally cannot say

that there is a dearth, because there -- it's extremely

difficult to search this Court's records from that period
