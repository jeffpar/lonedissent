ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. AMLONG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. AMLONG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is an employment discrimination case in

12

which there are two issues facing the Court.

13

whether the Court of Appeals applied too narrow a standard

14

in the application of agency principles to supervisory

15

liability under Title VII for sexual harassment.

16

second is whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing

17

the findings of the District Court, who had found

18

constructive and actual knowledge by an agent of the City,

19

Robert Gordon, and had also imputed constructive knowledge

20

to the City through the pervasiveness of the sexual

21

harassment in this case.

22

The relief that we ask --

23

QUESTION:

24
25

The first is

The

That isn't precisely the two

questions in your petition, is it?
MR. AMLONG:

No, Your Honor.

It's phrased

somewhat differently.

QUESTION:

3

petition you see as basically:

4

Appeals have affirmed the District Court?

5

MR. AMLONG:

So the second question in your
Should the Court of

Based on the factors I set forth in

6

the petition, Mr. Chief Justice, that there was the

7

pervasiveness that could give rise to constructive

8

knowledge, and it should be re -- clearly erroneous

9

standard, that there was notice to an intermediate agent,

10

Mr. Gordon, and that there was no dissemination of the

11

sexual harassment policy.

12

QUESTION:

13

permit pervasiveness?

14

MR. AMLONG:

Well, what -- what do you mean by

I mean, by pervasiveness, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, that there were eight women who were sexually

16

harassed by Mr. Terry and/or Mr. Silverman over a period

17

of 4 years.

18

that's what the District Court found.

19
20
21

That's what the record evidence showed.

QUESTION:

And

So pervasiveness means multiple

victims, then?
MR. AMLONG:

Pervasiveness can have more than

22

one meaning.

But in this case, yes, it does, Your Honor.

23

Pervasiveness in the sense of Harris v. Forklift Systems,

24

could mean one person with -- kind of be secret

QUESTION:

Secret pervasiveness.

2

MR. AMLONG:

That's --

A pervasiveness -- a pervasiveness,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, that would apply only to that person.

4

In this case, the pervasiveness is not only as to Beth Ann

5

Faragher, the Petitioner, who was repeatedly and

6

consistently sexually harassed, but was also to seven

7

other women.

8

that I argue gives rise to constructive notice.

9

that pervasiveness, Your Honor, that differs from the

10

Now, it is that pervasiveness, Your Honor,
It is

pervasiveness in Harris.
QUESTION:

11

I don't know how -- I mean,

12

constructive notice, I can't imagine how secret

13

pervasiveness could ever -- could ever give rise to

14

constructive notice.

15

MR. AMLONG:

16

QUESTION:

17

Nor can I.
Okay.

So you're saying that it was

so obvious that the employer must have known about it?

18

MR. AMLONG:

Either must have known about it or

19

was engaged in willful ignorance about it.

20

to know about it.

21

over a 4-year period and not expect the employer to know

22

about it.

QUESTION:

Did not wish

You can't sexually harass eight women

The employer is downtown, in -- in

24

city hall.

And all of this is going on across the

25

highway, on the beach.

Now, is -- is it implausible that

1

he would know about it -- that -- that the employer would

2

not know about it?

3

MR. AMLONG:

Not at all, Your Honor.

Because,

4

Justice Scalia, number one, the beach is 1.5 miles from

5

city hall, roughly the distance from this Court to the

6

Washington Monument.

throughout the Nation, headquartered in New York.

responsible for it.

You

Here, they were not -- here, they did not know

12

13

about it because of two things.

14

Gordon, who was a captain, an intermediate supervisor and

15

someone who should be expected to have carried the message

16

forward to city hall, declined to do so when he was told

17

by --

18

QUESTION:

Number one, Robert

He wasn't asked to do so.

19

he was asked as a friend.

20

asked what he though, as a friend.

21

seemed from the testimony?

22

MR. AMLONG:

I thought

He was told as a friend, and
Isn't that what it

No, Justice Ginsburg.

What is in

23

the testimony is that they did -- and what the trial judge

24

found -- is that they did find -- that they did hold

25

Mr. Gordon in very high repute.

And that's why they came

to him.

Mr. Gordon testified, however, that Nancy

2

Ewanchew, a co-plaintiff below, had asked him repeatedly,

3

What can you do about this?

4

Other women had complained to him.

Can you make this stop?

5

Did they complain to him as a friend?

6

Did that take away his status as an agent of the

7

City?

No, Your Honor, it did not.
QUESTION:

8
9

Yes.

Well, let me ask you about the

third -- what you list under "C."

Suppose the City had

10

had just a fine policy against this kind of conduct.

And

11

it was included in the manual that every employee got.

12

And it had the telephone number in city hall to call when

13

incidents like this came up.

15

16

City?

And everything else is the

Would there be Title VII liability for -- what was

MR. AMLONG:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there would

18

be.

19

to hold the City liable.

20

kind of agency principles that are embodied in the second

21

clause --

22

And that goes to the second ground on which we seek

QUESTION:

Which is the invocation of the

Well, then, what you make -- you seem

23

to make quite a thing out of this -- there was no

24

procedure that was -- that was well-known.

But now you

MR. AMLONG:

1

No, Your Honor.

It does make a

2

difference.

3

argument that we're making is -- and the Court of Appeals

4

held that to impose liability on the City in those

5

circumstances, that -- under 219(2)(d) -- that

6

Mr. Gordon -- I'm sorry -- Mr. Silverman and Mr. Terry

7

would have had to explicitly threatened Ms. Faragher or to

8

actually used their power to harm.

9

Because what we are asking in the 219(2) (d)

What we are arguing, Justice Ginsburg, is that

10

the dynamic of a supervisor/subordinate relationship gives

11

rise to a reasonable fear of retaliation, so that these

12

women will put up with this stuff.

13

Now, the City --

14

QUESTION:

15

Is -- is that -- that sounds like

strict liability to me.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. AMLONG:

That sounds like strict liability.
No, it does not, Your Honor, with

18

all due respect.

19

Mr. Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, if we argued,

20

perhaps, under 219(1), that they were doing this in the

21

course of their employment.

I believe it would be strict liability,

What we're saying is that there is liability

22

when they are aided in the commission of the tortious

24

behavior.

subordinate/superior relation.

MR. AMLONG:

MR. AMLONG:

Well, that's strict liability.
No, it's not, Your Honor,

Strict liability is --

QUESTION:

8

Yes, Your Honor.

That's strict liability whenever

there is a -- a superior that harasses a subordinate.
MR. AMLONG:

10

Strict liability, Justice Kennedy,

11

is in such instances as somebody convicted of shooting

12

birds over a baited field, somebody who is shown to have

13

made a profit on insider trading, in -- in short-swing

14

investments under 16(b) of the Securities Act of 1934.

16

Well, could you give us some examples

17

of situations in which the employer would not be liable

under your hypothesis?

Yes, I can, Justice O'Connor.

Yes,

I can.

What we're asking --

QUESTION:

Well, you have just informed Justice

6

Ginsburg that if the employer had had a strong policy,

7

fully communicated, that it wouldn't make any difference.

8

Now, what position are you taking?

9

MR. AMLONG:

I am taking the position, Your

Honor, that, number one, in this case, there was no

Is there any other example of when an

Well, the company could have the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. GORNSTEIN:

6

7

please the Court:
Our position is that Respondent is potentially

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

liable for the hostile work environment experienced by

10

Petitioner on three different grounds.

11

Respondent's delegation of authority to Terry to run the

12

beach, coupled with the failure to disseminate an

13

anti-harassment policy, made the creation of a hostile

14

work environment possible.

15
16

QUESTION:

First, that

Second, that knowledge of --

Now, you -- you would say that, and

that alone, is -- is sufficient to impose liability?

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's correct.

Although, I --

18

I would have to elaborate on the standard for deciding

19

when it is that the delegation of power has made the

creation of the hostile work environment possible.

Well, suppose -- so you'd say, in my

But your position was, even if there

12

MR. AMLONG:

Justice Ginsburg, my position is

that if there was a policy, it would not make an automatic

Now, they had a policy.

19

to report, the policy, which is found at page 267 of the

joint appendix, says, in pertinent part, a -- speaking
