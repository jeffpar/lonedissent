MR. MATTHIAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

Mr. Matthias,

alternatively,

do you think this suit

22

could have been brought as a class action in a State court

23

MR. MATTHIAS:

As a declaratory judgment?

Yes.

MR. MATTHIAS:

1

There is a -- Your Honor, there

2

is a provision of California law for declaratory

3

judgments.

4

provisions of that.

5

QUESTION:

6

alternatives might have been.

7

the suit was filed in Federal court, but presumably had it

8

been filed this same kind of issue and demand in State

9

court, it would be all right as far as you're concerned.

10

I'm not intimately familiar with the

Well, I'm just wbndering what the

MR. MATTHIAS:

You're objecting because

Well, I'm not sure that the State

11

courts would have thought themselves to be an appropriate

12

forum for entertaining the question insofar as the issue

13

of 154 compliance or not only has significance for --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, a State court can decide that

just as well as a Federal court, couldn't it?
MR. MATTHIAS:

Certainly I'm convinced that a

17

State court could read the Federal statute, interpret it,

18

and would be actually in a better position to understand

19

the issue at least insofar as the 154 compliance

20

question --

21

QUESTION:

Well, as a practical matter it makes

22

a lot of sense to have the whole issue resolved and not do

23

it case-by-case in every separate Federal habeas petition

24

that's filed.

25

think, from the standpoint of the State as well as the

I mean, that makes some sense, I would

defendants.

2

MR. MATTHIAS:

It does make some sense.

It also

3

makes some sense to allow issues to percolate, especially

4

an issue as difficult as this one has evidently proved for

5

many Federal courts.

6

California, because in fact only one Federal court has

7

been allowed, has allowed itself, effectively,

8

this question, but I certainly don't dispute that there is

9

some economy in somehow aggregating these issues, and

10

Obviously not Federal courts within

to consider

there are procedures for that.
Your Honor's suggestion about perhaps going to

11
12

State court at least on some of the subissues that will

13

turn critically on questions of State --

14
15

QUESTION:

18

the whole

thing.

16
17

Not just the subissues,

MR. MATTHIAS:

That, too, might have been

available.
QUESTION:

Did -- has California complied -- by

19

the way, has California adopted a statute in the interim,

20

since we took this --

21

MR. MATTHIAS:

Yes.

There was a change in the

22

law the effect of which -- the effective date of which is

23

January 1 of this year, and a handful,

24

to five death row inmates have since had their counsel

25

appointed under that new procedure and,

and I think three

when they finish their State proceeding in however many
years that takes, and they then move to Federal court if
that proves necessary, then the issue of Chapter 154
compliance at/or -- I should say, the issue of Chapter 154
applicability to their Federal habeas proceedings will
then turn on what we call the new law.
I will indicate, though, that obviously the vast
majority of the class is utterly unaffected.
QUESTION:

Now, you're arguing, Mr. Matthias,

that the Eleventh Amendment bars this proceeding.
are a number of State officials joined.

There

Was the State of

California also joined?
MR. MATTHIAS:

No.

The State itself was never

named as a defendant formally.
QUESTION:

And so you're arguing this is not an

appropriate ex parte Young situation, I guess.
MR. MATTHIAS:
QUESTION:

Precisely.

And who were the State officials who

were joined?
MR. MATTHIAS:

It's two wardens.

It's the

warden at San Quentin, where the men's death row is
housed.
QUESTION:

Were the wardens going around making

contentions about what California had done by way of
providing counsel?

MR. MATTHIAS:

To my knowledge the wardens had

never breathed a word on the subject of 154 -QUESTION:

Was there an allegation in the

complaint that the wardens had made these contentions?
MR. MATTHIAS:

No.

There was an allegation in

6

the complaint, I think generically, and I think the theory

7

here was that insofar as the Warden Calderon and Warden

8

Farmon would be the named defendants in any habeas

9

proceeding, they would be the ones who would be urging

10
11

Federal courts to apply chapter 154.
And the Attorney General of the State of

12

California, approximately 1 year before the AEDPA passed,

13

testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee praised

14

the AEDPA and expressed the view that it would work very

15

well in California insofar as it took account of

16

California's unitary review procedure where collateral

17

claims and direct appeal claims can be processed at or

18

about the same time.

QUESTION:

They're on a roughly parallel

And he's a defendant, the Attorney

General's a defendant?
MR. MATTHIAS:

Yes.

The Attorney General

23

himself is a defendant and as I read the complaint the

24

sole wrongful conduct attributed to the Attorney General

25

in this case were his statements to the Senate expressing

1

approval of the AEDPA and expressing rather optimistically

2

the hope that it would work well in California.
QUESTION:

3

Are you suggesting by what you just

4

said that California's position really is kind of iffy,

5

non-final on this matter of whether the State complies

6

with 154, because I thought that the lawsuit was premised

7

on the idea that California has said yes, we make it, we

8

fit under 154, but now you seem to be saying something

9

that would -- doesn't even get us to something fancy like

10

the Eleventh Amendment, that California really hasn't

11

taken a firm position.
MR. MATTHIAS:

12

Well, California officials

13

certainly spoke to the issue publicly.

14

little chance to actually advocate this position in the

15

context of any actual pending habeas proceeding because

16

Mr. Ashmus filed his lawsuit about 4 hours after the

17

AED --

18
19

QUESTION:

We had precious

Well, what is California's position

right now, yes we fit, or maybe we fit, we hope we fit?
MR. MATTHIAS:

20

No, it's not maybe.

We believe

21

firmly that we have qualified under the provisions of

22

Chapter 154 since June of 1989.

23

regularly appointed counsel to represent death row

24

inmates --

We have since that time

you said before.

saying, it's still iffy, he just made that one statement

or two statements, and he was under pressure and all that,

final decision, we comply, is that -MR. MATTHIAS:

12

13

We believe we have complied, and

I think --

14

QUESTION:

You say you've complied, but you

15

didn't say you had complied earlier.

16

time this complaint was filed there was no -- no evidence

17

that you had -- that the State had taken a firm position

18

we were in compliance.

MR. MATTHIAS:

You're saying at the

That's correct.

We had made --

20

there had been State officials who had made statements to

21

the media, there were State officials who had testified

22

before Congress and expressed the view that we had

complied.

point?

MR. MATTHIAS:

During the litigation I think it

2

became clear that the plaintiffs had correctly anticipated

3

our position.

take the position that we are a Chapter 154 --

5

They understood, anticipated that we would

QUESTION:

So a plaintiff is predicting what a

defense would be, and then the defendant says, yes, that's

7

our defense, and that's the basis for a lawsuit?

MR. MATTHIAS:
this lawsuit.

That appears to be the basis for

Yes, Your Honor, that appears to be the

10

basis for this lawsuit, and I frankly don't think it

11

matters whether or not we had managed to somehow get

12

ourselves into a courtroom and assert to the Federal

13

district court judge, Your Honor, we believe this new law

14

applies, or if we hadn't.

Either way, our role in Federal

State officials --

QUESTION:

We are not

It's to be applied by Federal courts,

which is why I'm not sure that there could have been a

courts declare, that Federal courts must follow the AEDPA?

2

I don't think State --

3

MR. MATTHIAS:

4

QUESTION:

5

No, I --

-- courts would give that kind of a

declaratory judgment.
MR. MATTHIAS:

6

I don't think it would be that,

7

Your Honor, but I think -- and the reason I responded

8

affirmatively to Justice O'Connor's question is, I thought

9

we both understood, and it's true that there are State law

10

subquestions lurking in the AEDPA.

11

under the AEDPA, State law provisions must be of a certain

12

character.

13

In order to qualify

The State must have done certain things.
QUESTION:

But unless California has a very

14

unusual declaratory judgment procedure, you usually

15

declare the existence of nonexistence of a certain right.

16

You just don't come in and say, I want an abstract

17

interpretation of this subproposition of law, am I right

18

or wrong about it.

19

entitled to this or you're not entitled to this.

20

I mean, you usually say you're

MR. MATTHIAS:

I quite agree, although there's

21

another relevant change in the law, a very recent

22

development that speaks to this precise question.

23

When this lawsuit was filed, California did not

24

have a certified question procedure.

25

very concrete.

Let me make this

One of the questions, one of the

1

subquestions that lurks in a question of compliance, is a

2

State in compliance or not, is whether or not a State has

3

a rule of court governing the appointment of counsel and

4

standards.
Now, California clearly has written published

5
6

standards, and you can find them in your own law library,

7

I'm confident, clearly has had that.
The claim of the inmates was that that did not

8

have the dignity of a rule of court within the meaning of
10

California law.

11

because there are many things that go by that label, rule

12

of court, under California law, and the district court

13

quite clearly did not understand that and applied one very

14

rigid question of California law, one very rigid

15

definition, the most limited definition possible.

16

That's actually not that easy a question,

Now, if California standards for the employment

17

of counsel deserve dignity as a rule of law, that's a

18

State law question.

1

understand that and correctly construe it, but in this

20

case that failed. I'm just using this as one example.

The Federal courts we had hoped would

There really would have been -- when this

21
22

lawsuit was filed there was no mechanism for the Federal

23

courts to turn to the State courts in California and

24

effectively ask for guidance on that State procedural

25

question.

Fortunately, that, too, has changed, and

1

although the district court would not today have any

2

mechanism for asking for guidance on a certified question

3

basis from the district court, the Ninth Circuit surely

4

would have.
QUESTION:

5

Can -- I see that.

Are you finished

6

with that, because I've one question only that I'd like to

7

ask, if you're finished.

8

MR. MATTHIAS:

QUESTION:

Surely, Your Honor.

Go ahead.

What in your opinion is the right

10

route?

11

of California thinks it has complied with the counsel

12

requirements in AEDPA, and a group of prisoners on death

3
4

That is to say, I believe that you think the State

row think they have not.
And so what the group of prisoners says is, if

5

we file our first habeas within

6

complain about the statute because we complied with it,

7

and if we wait until after

8

we're wrong, we are literally without a remedy to complain

9

about being sentenced to death.

20

80 days, we can't

80 days, and it turns out

Now, that seems a terrible dilemma to be in, and

2

that's why they filed this lawsuit, and I want to know, in

22

your opinion, are they without any remedy, or if they have

23

a remedy to test out the situation in advance, so they

24

don't get into that dilemma, specifically, what is it?

There are many, and they all

arise in the context of the habeas corpus proceeding

2

itself.

3

It's the earliest opportunity, perhaps, for an

4

inmate to learn whether or not the judge before whom he

5

appears with his habeas proceedings, it's -- the earliest

6

opportunity for him to learn whether or not that judge is

7

of the mind that 154 should apply is probably the very

8

first appearance he makes in that court, when he asks for

9

the appointment of Federal counsel and seeks a stay,

10

because if Chapter 154 is applicable in that jurisdiction,

11

the court's authority for entering that stay is 2262(a).

12

QUESTION:

But there's a problem with that,

13

because he has to file the petition in order to see the

14

judge, and I thought that the problem was how much time

15

does he have to file the petition.

16

time, or something like that.

17

MR. MATTHIAS:

If it's 154, half the

Your Honor, I'm speaking to a

18

point in time that typically precedes the actual filing of

19

a petition by years.

22

of a document that requests -- State proceedings are done,

he going to know any particular judge at that point?

7

MR. MATTHIAS:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MATTHIAS:

Yes.

He would be dealing with a -The procedure in the Northern

10

District and all the districts of California is that the

11

request for appointment of counsel gets docketed, it gets

12

a number, it gets the initials, it goes to a court, and

13

that judge almost invariably that day enters the stay,

14

signs the order, and the search for a lawyer begins.

15

And if the judge is going to enter a stay in a

16

death penalty case, that judge must at that point in the

18

going to be a Chapter 154 case, or is this going to be a

20

And the reason the judge must consider --

Okay.

Is there another one?

Let's

try another one.
MR. MATTHIAS:

He could ask -- he could ask the

13

court for guidance on that, and the judge would have to

14

provide it, because the judge is required to determine

15

whether Chapter 154 applies or not, because if it does,

16

the judge is statutorily obligated to give that matter

17

priority, so the Federal district judge must concern

18

himself with this question.

MR. MATTHIAS:

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

6

guidance be a good thing early on, and guidance would

attainable without suing State officials in a separate

them from ever breathing a word of their view again about

the question of compliance.

The district court is not in a

position to act illegally by erring.

3

judicial error, if it's anything.

4

QUESTION:

That's just pure

Well, you're right on that.

The

5

thing that -- I think the thing that's bothering me that

6

makes this a serious case is this.

7

essentially had I think two justifications, and they did

8

not have to be separated in Ex parte Young.

9

Ex parte Young

In the first place, there was the threat in

10

effect of the imposition or the threat of the -- an

11

illegal restriction upon the imposition of a tax, so that

12

if it was an improper restriction, the State officials

13

were acting illegally.

14

Secondly, there was what the Court described as

15

rather a fear of draconian consequences if an Ex parte

16

Young proceeding could not be brought because, in fact, if

17

it should turn out that those who wanted to protest the

18

State restriction were wrong, the consequences, the

19

exactions that the State would then be entitled to would

20

virtually, economically would destroy the person who had

21

objected.

22

for normal litigation.

23

The stakes, to put it crudely, were too high

What we've got here, arguably, is half of Ex

24

25

kind of threatened illegal action that Ex parte Young was

1

talking about.

2

But as Justice Breyer's question indicated,

3

there does seem to be an argument that if in fact the

4

prisoner who claims that the State is not in compliance,

5

that that prisoner either has to play it safe and act in

6

accordance with a shorter period, or the prisoner has to

7

take an awful risk, because if the prisoner is wrong, the

8

prisoner, in effect, will be executed without the benefit

9

of Federal process.
So it seems to me that arguably half of Ex parte

10
11

Young is here, and the question is, to me is, is that

12

enough?

13

to be missing, but is the draconian consequence half here,

14

and is that enough for us to say Ex parte Young should

15

apply?

16

I will agree with you that the other half seems

MR. MATTHIAS:

It is not here.

It is not here.

17

That draconian choice does not exist.

18

choice, that dilemma that you see referred to in the

respondent's brief, does not exist.

It won't change.

The question

whether a particular proceeding will be conducted under

12

Chapter 154 looks to the mechanism that was in place --

Yes, but not for the purpose of

MR. MATTHIAS:

2

it's 153 or 154.

3

The judge must also concern himself --

QUESTION:

But it -- for the purpose of what the

4

judge is doing at the moment, does it make any

5

difference -- does it have anything to do with what

6

counsel he can appoint, how much that counsel will be

7

paid, whether at that point he says 153 or 154?
MR. MATTHIAS:

8

9

It does, because the judge will

have read the statute and will understand that the minute

10

that petition is filed he's obligated to treat it with

11

priority over all other noncapital matters.

12

must concern himself, and I think it's inconceivable that

a court would concern itself with that question and

secret from the inmate, and --

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LAURENCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question before this Court is when a State

20

has declined to participate in a Federal program, does Ex

21

parte Young permit a declaratory judgment action to

22

prevent State officials from unlawfully, not necessarily

23

illegally, obtaining the benefits?

MR. LAURENCE:

1

The unlawfully aspect of this

2

case is that Ex parte Young doesn't focus merely on

3

whether the State's actions are illegal, but rather

4

whether or not the State's actions interfere with a

5

cognizable Federal right, and that is precisely what -QUESTION:

6

Well, that's not really right.

It's

7

only been used to enjoin some kind of continuing violation

8

of Federal law and as I understood this new Federal

9

procedure, the State isn't obliged to opt for a unitary

10

review procedure.
It's an option open to a State that meets

11
12

certain requirements, and California now has passed a

13

statute apparently trying to opt in, but it doesn't

14

violate the law by not doing so, or by taking a position

15

on whether it wants to or doesn't want to.

16

just the strangest complaint that you've made.
MR. LAURENCE:

17

I mean, that's

The question of whether or not

18

California's entitled to the benefits of Chapter 154 is

maintain the status quo under Chapter 153, and States

2

cannot be sued to be forced to opt in under Chapter 154,

3

but Congress did say that if the State does not opt in to

4

Chapter 154, they are not entitled to the benefits of

5

Chapter 154.
QUESTION:

6

But your injunction that you obtained

7

in the district court prohibits the State from taking the

8

position that 154 applies, and the State says, it seems to

9

me with considerable justification, that there is nothing

10

illegal about our arguing the position, and you have

11

therefore taken away one of the principal threshold

12

primary tests for Ex parte Young.
The State is doing nothing illegal in arguing a

13
14
15

position.
MR. LAURENCE:

What the district court found as

16

a matter of fact as well as a matter of law is that the

17

effect of the threats that the State of California would

18

invoke Chapter 154 in future habeas proceedings was that

19

petitioners were forced to comply with 154 in - - without

20

regard to the law.

21

QUESTION:

But that has nothing to do with the

22

State's position, the State violating the law.

So it put

23

these death row inmates to their option, but that

24

doesn't -- the State has a perfect right, I would think,

25

to make an argument that thus-and-such is so.

If it's

wrong, it will be told so, but to make an argument of law

2

that ultimately turns out to be incorrect surely is not

3

violating the law.

4

6

The district court -- you know, a lot of mumbojumbo doesn't change that.
MR. LAURENCE:

What the district court found was

7

that Chapter 154 does not apply in California.

8

the basis for the declaratory judgment.

That was

9

To give effect to that declaratory judgment,

10

however, the court found it necessary to enact a re --

11

antirelitigation injunction, preventing the State from

12

going to the next courtroom and saying, we don't care what

13

this judge said over here, Chapter 154 does apply here, in

14

an attempt at creating divergence opinions, and divergent

15

opinions are precisely what Justice O'Connor pointed to as

16

the problem.

17

QUESTION:

But Mr. Laurence, I take it from what

18

you said about the declaratory judgment that nothing

19

really turns on California's bragging or -- that the

20

defendants on death row would be in precisely the same

21

position if the California Attorney General didn't speak

22

one word, as long as there was a realistic suspicion that

23

California might take this position.

the AG's office said, yeah, we might take that position.

2

I don't see that your case is any stronger than it would

be if all there was was a suggestion that California might

make such a claim.

differently situated in those cases, explain to me why.

If your death row inmate is

MR. LAURENCE:

That is absolutely correct, that

7

whether or not you're entitled to a declaratory judgment

8

does not turn on whether or not the State officials have

9

already asserted compliance with Chapter 154.

10

QUESTION:

So you're saying every death row

11

inmate in every State in the country could come in and

12

say, district court, give us the assurance that when we

13

file our petition it will be under 153 and not 154.

14

Nothing peculiar to California and the Attorney General

15

having acted in a certain way.

16

MR. LAURENCE:

I think there are two limiting

17

principles here that would prevent that kind of result.

18

That's not a right.
MR. LAURENCE:

Congress I believe established

5

that these two procedures cannot coexist, that habeas

6

petitioners, by default, as this Court recognized in Lindh

7

v. Murphy, are entitled to the benefits of Chapter 153.

8

They have 1 -- up to 1 year to file their Federal

9

petitions.

They have the normal rules of amending those

10

petitions, and they have the additional procedures that

11

are governed by 153.

12

Chapter 154 is far more restrictive, requiring

13

habeas petitioners to do far more faster than anything we

14

ever saw in Chapter 153.

15

If Congress intended our rights to be vindicated

16

under Chapter 153, the only way to obtain those rights is

17

a declaration that we are entitled to those rights.

QUESTION:

Why should it be different here?

5

MR. LAURENCE:

A statute of limitations that

does not depend upon an assertion of a defense by a State

7

officer does not involve the same kind of problems that

8

were recognized in Ex parte Young.

QUESTION:

Yes, but the problems are --

certainly that doesn't make it any easier for you.

makes it harder.

12

MR. LAURENCE:

you have filed in excess of the time permitted by one of

say, upon the assertion of a defense by the State?

the fact the State has not demonstrated --

QUESTION:

But if -- cases like Great Lakes v.

Huffman and others say that you have to comply with
virtually the same requirements to get a declaratory
judgment that you have to comply with to get an
injunction, so it's not as if you can avoid the principles
of injunctive law on the merits by saying all I want is a
declaratory judgment.

You have to make a showing there,

too.
MR. LAURENCE:

You certainly have to make a

showing that there's an actual case or controversy as well
as the particular requirements of standing, Federal
jurisdiction, and everything else, but the State here has
conceded that a declaratory judgment was proper in the
district court if it had been made in a habeas proceeding
in behalf of an individual petitioner.
QUESTION:

Well, that wouldn't be so much of a

declaratory judgment.

That would simply be a ruling on

the habeas petition that it was timely filed.

in that sense you can say that any number of rulings are
declaratory judgments.

that a separate declaratory judgment would be proper.

QUESTION:

Mr. Laurence, getting down to one of

8

the themes that we have here, which is what's different

9

about the claim that you're making from the claim of any

litigant who says, I'm not quite sure when to sue, so I'd

like to bring a preliminary threshold action to litigate

limitations --

MR. LAURENCE:

15

QUESTION:

I think that --

What is at stake here that's not at

16

stake there?

In each of those cases, if the litigant

17

comes in on the assumption that the shorter statute

18

applies, the litigant is going to lose some luxury of time

19

which the litigant would have had if the longer statute

applies, so no question, you would lose that, too.

21

Do you lose anything else?

this to the level of a case or controversy whereas a

14

MR. LAURENCE:

I think the Congress has set up

The question would be whether he has a right to amend

after the period goes by if 154 applies.

The first petition he files may be
He may not have thought of all his claims.

MR. LAURENCE:

That's absolutely correct,

18

because if you file your petition and you're governed by

19

Chapter 153, the normal rules of amendments apply, but if

20

you're -- if you file a petition and you're governed by

21

Chapter 154, you cannot --

more, but they certainly ask for no less.

4

QUESTION:

They ask for no

Well, we have certain rules, too, you

5

know, as to when various pleadings have to be filed, as

6

well as statutory rules about, you know, how long after

7

the judgment in the court of appeals you can seek

8

certiorari.
Why is your case different from the case in

10

which someone claims that the judgment in the court of

11

appeals was entered at a much later date than the other

12

side could plausibly claim?

13

against the other side asserting that the judgment in the

court of appeals was entered at the later date in order

15

that he can assure himself of having another year to

prepare his petition for certiorari?

MR. LAURENCE:

QUESTION:

MR. LAURENCE:

Can that person bring a suit

I don't believe so.

I don't --

Why not?
I don't believe that the rules

governing when you must file the cert petition depend upon

It depends -- you mean, it depends on the action of

MR. LAURENCE:

2

QUESTION:

3

5

Absolutely.

Not on whether the State has -- is

taking the position that they satisfy the statute.
MR. LAURENCE:

Yes.

Exactly, and the other option

that the habeas --

6

QUESTION:

That is --

7

MR. LAURENCE:

-- petitioners had is that they

8

could have waited until their petitions were finally

9

complete, filing them 6, 7, 8, 9 months after their direct

10

appeal was concluded, and risk having the State come in

11

and say, I'm sorry, you will be executed because you

12

failed to comply with the 6-month statute of limitations.

13

And Justice O'Connor's question at the beginning

14

of this proceeding I think was completely appropriate,

15

which is, do we want to have a uniform resolution of the

16

systemic question, and I think the answer has to be yes,

17

and you have to provide habeas petitioners with some means

18

of ascertaining their rights.

19

QUESTION:

And that answer would be yes even if

20

the State had said nothing at all on this question, just

21

the fact that they might do it?

22

MR. LAURENCE:

I believe so.

I believe that it

23

does not depend on whether or not they assert compliance

24

if they have the capability of asserting compliance.

If they sat in their offices and said, we'll let

you know in 6 months whether or not the statute is going

to apply to you, then I think you have a Declaratory

Judgment Act that allows you to come in and say, we have a

real controversy here, because Congress says there are two

competing mechanisms.

QUESTION:

Please decide -I just want to be clear on what your

position is, that this could be done in every State except

for those States that have admitted that they fall far

short of what's required to fit under 154.

MR. LAURENCE:

Or where the issue has -- doesn't

have to address 400 individuals.

For example, Maryland,

12

which could have done this in a simple district court

action in which the habeas petitioner could have resolved

14

that issue on his behalf.

We're talking about California, that has --

QUESTION:

Well, the fact that there are only

17

six people in -- maybe, if that's what you're talking

18

about in Maryland on death row, it still would have to

19

bring this kind of a threshold case, because whether we're

20

talking about six or 600 they all still face the dilemma

21

that you say.

22

investigated, it's going to be an inadequate complaint, so

23

that shouldn't matter.

That there are only six shouldn't affect whether
you can bring this kind of lawsuit.
