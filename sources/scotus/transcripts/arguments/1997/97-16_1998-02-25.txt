MR. STEWART:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The National Forest Management Act requires the

13

United States Forest Service to devise forest plans for

14

each of the units within the national forest system.

15

the plans are to be revised at 10 to 15-year intervals,

16

and they perform two basic functions.

That

17

First, they provide general guidance to Forest

18

Service employees in the management of the affected unit

19

and, second, they serve a public informational function by

20

giving the public general information about the likely

21

management activities within the forest and, while the

22

plans vary widely from place to place, all forest plans

23

contain projections concerning anticipated timber

24

harvesting activities within the national forest, and it's

25

that feature of the plan that's at issue here today.

I'd like to start by saying that in our view it

1
2

would be misleading to frame the question presented in

3

this case as whether forest plans are reviewable.

4

not asking for a per se rule in this case and,

5

we're really not asking for a special rule for forest

6

plans.

We're

indeed,

What we're saying is that the Court should

7
8

examine the particular plan provision that is at issue and

9

ask whether the decision or determination reflected in

10

that provision is reviewable under ordinary principles of

11

administrative law and,

12

projections at issue in this case don't meet that test.

in our view,

MR. STEWART:

The plans are unified documents.

provisions may reflect decisions having immediate on-the-

It is a single

20

ground impact,

21

whether the particular plan provision at issue in a case

22

has immediate on-the-ground impact, and --

25

others will not, and the question should be

provision that would have immediate impact?

Ninth Circuit this past summer and fall was a case in

2

which the Forest Service amended the standards and

3

guidelines contained in a plan that regulated the manner

4

in which timber harvesting activities would be conducted

5

and the document that adopted the plan amendment said,

6

these amended standards and guidelines will not apply to

7

ongoing timber harvesting activities.

8
9

And we were sued in that case and the
plaintiff's contended that the agency had behaved

10

unlawfully in failing to apply the new standards and

11

guidelines to ongoing projects.

12

In the end we prevailed on the merits in that

13

case, but we conceded that that was a justiciable

14

controversy, because the decision not to make the

15

standards and guidelines immediately applicable would have

16

immediate on-the-ground impact.

17

QUESTION:

Well,

I take it you'd agree here that

18

if their claim were that your plan was allowing

19

motorcycles into a bird-watching area or something that

20

like,

theory, would it not?

that would be immediately justiciable on your

is there anything in those that

I think the Court frankly has

7

discretion whether to consider them or not.

8

of the record below.

9

They are part

I think probably the more normal course would be

10

not to consider them because they were filed after the

11

court of appeals issued its decision and consequently they

12

weren't part of the record that was before the court of

13

appeals.

14

We don't believe,

in any event,

that the

15

affidavits affect the justiciability of plaintiff's facial

16

challenge to the plan.

17

suggest that there are individual timber harvesting

18

activities which are having,

19

enjoined,

1

National Forest Management Act doesn't contain its own

2

judicial review provision, so that the suit was brought

3

under the APA.
Now, the harvesting projections contained in the

4
5

Wayne plan are contingent and uncertain in several

6

important respects.

7

QUESTION:

Would you be saying the same thing if

8

it were the timber companies complaining and saying this

9

plan doesn't reserve enough land for timber harvesting, it

10

gives over too much land to other uses and excludes

11

harvesting?
MR. STEWART:

12

Well, if, for instance, the timber

13

industry contended that particular areas of the forest had

14

been improperly designated as unsuitable for harvesting I

15

think you'd really have a different sort of justiciability

16

problem.

17

a way that the suitability determination here is not.

18

That is, that sort of decision would be final in

That is, if land is designated as off-limits for

19

harvesting there's not some subsequent site-specific

20

decision as to whether timber will actually be harvested.

21

I think, though, that to establish --

22

QUESTION:

The difference is that in the case

23

posited by Justice Ginsburg it is clear that no harvesting

24

will occur.

QUESTION:

1

Whereas here it is not clear that

2

harvesting will occur.

3

MR. STEWART:

4

Now,

That's correct.

I think the industry plaintiff might still

5

have difficulty establishing the redressibility component

6

of standing, because the plaintiff would have to show that

7

redesignation of the land as suitable for timber

8

harvesting was ultimately likely to lead to a decision

9

actually to harvest timber and to the award of a contract

10

to the particular company,

11

sort of justiciability problem.

12

Now - -

13

QUESTION:

so there would be a different

Could I ask just sort of a background

14

question?

15

understand it, about -- most of the land in the

16

national -- in this forest is owned privately.

I'm a little confused about the whole -- as I

17

MR. STEWART:

18

QUESTION:

And is the clearcutting and the

19

timber that's cut down,

20

that on public land?

21

That's correct.

MR. STEWART:

is that all on private land,

No.

or is

The only thing we're talking

22

about here, and the only part of this area that the plan

23

regulates is the federally owned land.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. STEWART:

It's only federally owned land?
That's correct.

3

QUESTION:

So that about 80 percent of the

forest, the plan just doesn't apply to?
MR. STEWART:

I'm not even sure if you would

4

call that the national forest.

5

is an odd sort of national forest in that it consists of

6

three or four noncontiguous segments and it's interspersed

7

with privately owned land, but the management plan takes

8

into account uses on surrounding property, but it does not

9

regulate those uses.

10
11

QUESTION:

So the plan itself just regulates

activities on Government-owned property?

12

MR. STEWART:

13

QUESTION:

14
15
16
17

It is land within -- this

That's correct.

And that's only about 20 percent of

the total forest?
MR. STEWART:

It's -- that's correct.

It's

around 176,000 federally owned acres.
Now, the forest plan contains projections as to

18

the possible aggregate quantity of timber that might be

19

harvested on the forest during the plan period, but those

20

harvesting projections are not binding.

21

for the Forest Service to harvest substantially less

22

timber than it is allowed to harvest on a particular unit.

It's not uncommon

23

And I think, second, even leaving aside the

24

determination as to aggregate quantity of timber, the

25

forest plan leaves the Service with very substantial

latitude as to where within the forest harvesting will

2

occur.

3

For example, this forest plan designated

4

approximately

26,000 acres within the forest as suitable

5

for timber harvesting, but it projected that less than

8,000 acres within the forest would actually be harvested

during the first

where within the forest the Service intends to harvest

timber, various things remain uncertain.

10

First, we don't know whether particular people

11

will be hurt, whether their activities within the forest

12

will be impaired by the harvesting that does occur.

QUESTION:

What if they claim that they use the

That would cover that problem, I assume.

MR. STEWART:

I think if they literally claimed

6

that they use the entire forest, they -- at least at the

7

motion to dismiss stage, that would take care of it.

8

the summary judgment stage they would be required to

9

furnish evidence to that effect.

At

Second, even aside from the uncertainty as to

2

what people will be injured, we really don't know whether

22

logging will be rational until we know on what site it is

23

designated to occur.

25

That is, it's integral to the Forest Service's
implementation of the National Forest Management Act that

1

the propriety of timber harvesting can vary widely from

2

site to site even within a particular national forest.

3

That's why --

4

QUESTION:

Suppose they said that about 80,000

5

would be targeted for timber -- out of the 126,000 acres

6

total, and they said, oh, about 80,000 are eligible for

7

timber-cutting.

8

calculus here vary?

9

Would the standing calculus, the ripeness

MR. STEWART:

I don't think that it would vary

10

because the 80,000, whatever figure the Forest Service

11

projected would still only be a projection.

12

We still wouldn't know whether the Forest

13

Service would actually harvest timber up to that amount

14

and until it conducted the site-specific analysis of

15

particular tracts we wouldn't know whether it made sense

16

to harvest timber there, so I think in a sense this is a

17

paradigmatic example of a case in which deferral of

18

litigation until a latter stage in the process would

19

conserve the resources of the court and prevent

20

unnecessary litigation.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, your -- the Sierra Club

22

at least has raised one answer to that argument and I'd

23

like you to comment on it.

24
25

They say that if, in fact, they have to wait for
site-specific decisions they will, in order to maintain

1

their objection to the plan, have to challenge every

2

single one of them, because part of their argument is that

3

there is just a legally erroneous imbalance here between

4

the timbering decision -- the timbering allocation and the

5

nontimbering allocation, and so they say I think at one

6

point in their brief that if they do what you claim they

7

should do they're going to have to file something like 40

8

lawsuits and that would not conserve judicial resources.

9

They're addressing, in other words, the hardship

10

prong both to themselves and, I suppose, to the courts

11

under Abbott Lab.

12

What is your response to that?

13

MR. STEWART:

14
15

I think there are about three

different responses.
The first is that if it is, in fact, true that

16

there is a particular plan-level determination that is

17

dispositive with respect to a number of timber sales then,

18

if the plaintiff files suit to challenge an initial sale

19

and persuades the district court or the court of appeals,

20

if the case is taken up on appeal that the plan-level

21

determination is irrational, that determination will be

22

preclusive in subsequent litigation between the same

23

parties, so a single party is not going to have to

24

relitigate the same issue over and over.

25

The second thing we would point out is that both

the Eighth and Eleventh -QUESTION:

2

Excuse me.

How could you ever come

3

to a determination in a single suit that the overall plan

4

level is irrational?

5

well,

6

activity, had we set aside less, we still might have

7

decided that this was the tract that we were going to log

8

on.

The Government will come in and say,

even if we did set aside too much for logging

MR. STEWART:

9

I mean,

I think one example of a

10

situation in which a plan-level determination might be

11

dispositive is if the plaintiffs came in and said, here is

12

a large area within the forest and the Forest Service

13

should have left that area entirely off-limits to logging,

14

and it was irrational for the Forest Service to permit any

15

logging within that area,

16

that it was indeed irrational to permit logging anywhere

17

within that area,

18
19
20

that determination would be preclusive.

QUESTION:
though,

and if they persuaded the court

It wouldn't go to the whole plan,

just to allowing that area to be logged.
It would be very hard,

it seems to me,

in any

21

individual case to challenge the overall determination

22

that X number of acres should be logged.

23

MR. STEWART:

I think -- I think -- well,

I

24

think it is certainly true that it's hard to imagine a

site-specific activity that would present a suitable

vehicle for the court to review the whole plan,

2

think if -QUESTION:

3
4

and I

Do you concede that there has to be

some mechanism for reviewing the whole plan?

5

MR. STEWART:

6

QUESTION:

No.

That every governmental

7

determination, no matter how high the level of generality

8

at which it is made, must be subject to judicial review?
MR. STEWART:

9

No, we don't.

If it were the case

10

that the Federal courts had unlimited time and resources

11

and if it were the case that the role of the Federal

12

courts was to monitor the agency's protection of the

13

public interest,

14

our theory that there will be no site-specific action that

15

brings the whole plan before the courts.

16

But,

then it would be a strong objection to

in fact,

as this Court noted in Defenders

17

of Wildlife,

the rights of individual litigants and Forest Service

So why wouldn't they be able to

this rule.

the rule isn't valid,

we don't know if they would have done it

MR. STEWART:

8
9

You would say,

Well,

I think in a sense this is a

familiar sort of 'problem in administrative law.
That is,

10

it's often the case that a particular

11

agency action will be brought before a court that

12

implicates a narrow,

specific regulatory provision,

and a

3

court will be told by the parties,

4

why this action does or doesn't make §ense, you have to

have an appreciation of the larger legal context,

parties will provide the court at least with general

7

information about what that context is.

But to say that you can review a specific action
within a larger context is different from saying that you
review the context as such.
The plaintiffs are always free to challenge

in order to understand

individual site-specific actions.
QUESTION:

23

Well, Mr. Stewart, what they

24

basically,

as I understand it, want to attack is a policy

of allowing clearcutting, or even-aged forest management,

QUESTION:

10

May I ask you, would you take that

position if the statute said in so many words,

there was a reasonable legal argument for saying

MR. QUARLES:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

please the Court:
I would like to turn to the merits and discuss
three of the Sixth Circuit's decisions.
QUESTION:

Just before you do that, why was it

that you intervened here?
MR. QUARLES:

We intervened here because we

23

believed that the respondents, or,

rather, the plaintiffs

24

had raised issues which we felt were inappropriate both as

25

to justiciability and as to the merits.

MR. QUARLES:

The decision gives it concrete

The decision said that because the Forest Service

was biased the plan was unlawful and,

in fact, when the

10

Sixth Circuit decision was remanded to the district court,

11

the district court read the Sixth Circuit decision as

saying that the Forest Service could not,

And that's why clearly, in most instances, even

MR. QUARLES:

1

Certainly they could,

and I think

2

that's an important issue to raise, because what both --

3

what respondents and their amici said in their briefs is,

4

they thought that the plan should be challenged before it

5

can be implemented,

6

15-year plans and we are 10 years from the date on

7

which -- 10-1/2 years from the date on which the plan was

8

first proposed.

9

and I remind you that these are 10 to

40 sales have proceeded.

Under respondent's theory,

the Forest Service

10

would have been paralyzed to do anything for these last 10

11

years until the validity of the plan had been established,

12

and we believe that's inappropriate.

13

The three bias issues that I would like to talk

14

about are first the --or the three merits issues,

The second is the Sixth Circuit's overturning of

19

that the plan overvalued timber, undervalued wilderness

technical expertise should have elicited judicial

deference.

that very proposition had been addressed and rejected by

2

the Fifth Circuit in an exhaustive opinion which the Sixth

3

Circuit did not even cite or address.

4

I think at the outset it's worth noting --

5

observing that the bias and merits rulings and the

6

standing rulings, the justiciability rulings, are cut from

7

the same cloth.

8

demonstrates the Sixth Circuit's failure to acknowledge

9

the limited authority of the Federal courts to inject

Each set of rulings in its own way

10

themselves into areas of policy that have been entrusted

11

to the political branches, and this is particularly true

12

in the case of the bias proposal of the Sixth Circuit.

13

Respondents did not attempt to defend that, but

14

they did say that it's dicta, and that this Court should

15

ignore it.

16

We don't believe it's dicta, but even if it is, the

17

suggestion that this Court should ignore it seems to be in

18

error.

19

That seems to be very wrong to me as an idea.

First of all, the Sixth Circuit clearly gave

20

that dicta for effect, and that effect that they wanted

21

was to have the agency note it and alter their behavior

22

accordingly and to have the district courts in the circuit

23

note it, and that's exactly what happened on remand.

24
25

The district court, in a transcript we lodged
with this Court, reviewed the bias ruling and found that

Mr. Quarles, you don't have too much

Why was the bias ruling wrong?
MR. QUARLES:

The bias ruling in my view is

wrong for several reasons.
First of all, it was made without any reference
to the administrative record.

There is nothing in the

10

administrative record to demonstrate that bias and the

11

court, in fact, used the bias ruling to avoid providing

12

any deference to the agency, even though this is the kind

13

of case that requires deference -- broad discretion,

14

technical expertise -- and, as this Court said in Chevron,

15

circumstances where Congress entrusted to the agency to

16

solve competing interests.

17

This is exactly such a case, because Congress

18

entrusted to the agency to solve competing demands by

19

multiple users of the forest, so in that sense I think

20

it's very wrong.

21

It's also wrong in the sense that typically

22

there is supposed to be a presumption of agency regularity

23

and good faith, and the only time that I'm aware when they

24

found bias has been in extrajudicial circumstances, and

25

that's not the case here.

They just simply said it was

that the farther a circuit court goes in dicta beyond its

believe this Court has the supervisory power to inform

lower courts when they clearly have violated the

separation of powers limitations, so for that reason, yes,

I think it is perfectly permissible, but certainly a

first of all let me say that the notion about multiple use

allocation, the bias toward timber, that was proven wrong.

20

If the Court had provided deference and looked

at the administrative record, the fact is that primitive

22

recreation received 26,000 acres, whereas timber

23

harvesting will only occur on 7,000.

were found suitable for timber harvesting, but the plan is

clear that in the life of the plan only 7,800-and-some-

MR. GITTES:

I believe the Sixth Circuit's

intent was to say the plan was biased,

that's their wording.

But one other point I want to emphasize here,

10

really understand this whole case the Court needs to

11

understand what it is,

12

the injury that led to this case.

This case arose because Forest Service

that may be a very stupid policy for the

They have fire-break limitations, they have a
