CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Ellerth.

Mr. Casey.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. CASEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CASEY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Is an employer strictly or automatically liable

11
12

for job-related threats made in conjunction with sexual

13

advances when the employee has suffered no tangible job

14

detriment for the rejection of those advances -- in other

15

words, the unfulfilled threat?

16
17
18

We submit that the answer to that question is
no.
Strict or automatic liability should not be

19

applied in a situation of unfulfilled threats, but rather

20

should be analyzed --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. CASEY:

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Casey.
Yes.
It sounds to me like you're asking

24

question 2 of the questions presented on petition for

25

certiorari, which is whether strict liability is the

proper standard.

Now, I thought the Court didn't grant

2

certiorari on question 2.

3

on question 1.

4

MR. CASEY:

5

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Most of your brief addresses question

6

2.

7

which cert was granted?

I mean, are we going to talk about question 1, on

MR. CASEY:

8

9

I thought we granted certiorari

Justice, the -- the -- the

question -- question 1 is the un -- is whether or not the

10

strict liability standard ought to apply in the

11

unfulfilled threat situation, where -- where there is no

12

adverse job consequence.

13

QUESTION:

14

liability actually.

15

quo sexual harassment may be stated under Title VII, when

16

the plaintiff has neither submitted to the sexual advances

17

nor suffered any tangible effects.

18

MR. CASEY:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Well, it doesn't address strict
It says whether a claim of quid pro

That's the question.

Yes, Justice.

Under --

It -- it doesn't refer to strict

liability.
MR. CASEY:

Under -- under the assumption,

22

Justice, that in -- that most courts, who have addressed

23

the issue, have addressed quid pro quo as a strict

24

liability issue.

25

liability for the unfulfilled threat.

And that's why I referred to the strict

1

why I believe it is -- it is cognizable under question 1,

2

which is the question that the Court did accept.

3

quite correct about that.

4

You are

But almost all of the courts who have addressed

5

quid pro quo sexual harassment have addressed it under the

6

theory of strict liability for the employer, where there

7

has been a adverse job action, such as a termination of

8

employment, a demotion, a transfer to a less fulfilling

9

job, a loss of benefits.

These are all tangible job

10

detriments, where the company has acted, through --

11

through a supervisor.
QUESTION:

12

13

other reason to have the quid pro quo category, is there?

14

MR. CASEY:

15

QUESTION:

16

19

Absolutely not, Your Honor.
Except to establish a different

standard of liability.
MR. CASEY:

17
18

Well, there -- there's really no

That's correct, Your Honor.

And --

and - QUESTION:

The statute doesn't -- doesn't

20

establish different kinds of sexual harassment -- quid pro

21

quo and -- and environmental harassment.

22

MR. CASEY:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. CASEY:

25

No, it does not.

It --

That's not in the statute, is it?
It does not, Your Honor.

But the

courts who have addressed the other violations of Title

VII, for example, in race cases, have attached strict

2

liability to the employer when the -- the supervisor has

3

taken an adverse job action, such as a termination of

4

someone because of their race, a refusal to hire someone

5

because of their race, a termination of someone because of

6

their national -- their national origins, because of their

7

religion.

8

liability.

Courts have viewed that as employer strict

On the other hand, when -- when in a race case,

9
10

for example, a -- a person is living in -- in a hostile

11

racial work environment, or a hostile environment to one's

12

religion, or a hostile environment because one happens to

13

be Korean or Indian or -- or English, that has been viewed

14

as whether or not the company has been negligent in

15

permitting that hostile work environment to exist.
QUESTION:

16

When you say "that has been viewed,"

17

you mean by some courts; and other courts say that --

18

well, first of all, you don't -- you don't challenge that

19

the claim here falls within Title VII, you are just

20

asserting that there is a different standard for the

21

employer?

22

MR. CASEY:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.
So everybody agrees that this kind of

claim is stated under Title VII?
MR. CASEY:

This is a -- this is a claim for

1

discrimination by reason of one's gender.
QUESTION:

2

And then how did we come to this

3

distinction, then?

4

about quid pro quo and it doesn't say a word about hostile

5

environment.

6

employment, period.

It says:

MR. CASEY:

7

Because the statute doesn't say a word

same terms and conditions of

It -- it does, indeed.

This Court,

8

in Meritor, acknowledged at least a distinction between

9

the hostile work environment and quid pro quo.

This

10

Court, in the Harris Forklift opinion, by noting that the

11

Harris case was not a quid pro quo case, implicitly

12

recognized the distinction.
I think the same distinction, Your Honor, has

13
14

been made in the other -- in the other type violations of

15

Title VII, in terms of -- of race and national origin,

16

where there has been an act.
QUESTION:

17

Do we have a race or national origin

18

case where there's a negligence, as opposed to vicarious

19

liability?

20

MR. CASEY:

Not from this Court.

There have

21

been -- there are many circuits who have -- who have

22

recognized that -- that the hostile environment -- the

23

racially hostile environment is -- is a negligence issue.

24

And -- and the standard the company or the employer is

25

held to is whether the -- whether the employer knew or

should have known of the -- of the racially hostile

2

environment.

3

what we are urging the Court to adopt in the sexual

4

harassment case.

5

And -- and the same distinction is -- is

QUESTION:

So suppose this supervisor -- let's

6

use race as an example -- suppose a supervisor says, I'm

7

not going to promote you because you're Asian, Hispanic,

8

whatever, and a week later does promote the person.

9

the person is no longer even working for that

supervisor -- promoted out of the department.

violation there?

MR. CASEY:

And

Is there a

In that one instance, I would say

there is not.

QUESTION:

15

MR. CASEY:

QUESTION:

17

MR. CASEY:

There is?
There is not a violation.
There is not.
If -- if there was repeated --

repeated and -- and repeatedly hostile comments made by

19

the supervisor to the employee because of his national --

20

I think there then would be a violation.

23

QUESTION:

But here --

And do you analogize what happened

here to the hypothetical that I -- I gave you?
MR. CASEY:

24

an implicit threat:

25

harder for you.

I do.

I do exactly.

Here there was

I could make your job easier or

And it was at -- at a job promotion

And in this case -QUESTION:

Well, suppose in the case that I --

4

that I put the promotion -- the case where I put it was --

5

that she was promoted the next week.

6

MR. CASEY:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.
Suppose in the race hypothetical the

8

promotion isn't going to come up for a year, but the

9

supervisor has said that.

Could the employee bring a

10

cause of action injunction?

11

just kind of a violation in the air, with no damage?

12

13
14
15
16

MR. CASEY:

I think -- I think there is no harm.

I think there is no harm.
QUESTION:

Or is there just no -- it's

Although --

Despite -- despite the insult and the

personal hurt, et cetera, et cetera?
MR. CASEY:

Well, I don't think, Your Honor,

17

that one insult is sufficiently severe to rise to -- to a

18

hostile environment, as -- as bad as it may --

19

QUESTION:

Well, what if -- what if you have a

20

situation of a supervisor for a large corporate employer

21

who routinely orders a female employee under his

22

supervision to go to a certain isolated place, where the

23

supervisor can be alone with this employee and repeatedly

24

then tries to use that opportunity for sexual

25

gratification -- repeatedly?

No -- no change in promotion

put it, negligent?

MR. CASEY:

Is -- is there vicarious liability

Your Honor, in -- in the example you

just gave, I believe that there -- there is very likely a

quid pro quo.

QUESTION:

No.

No.

I -- I left that out of the

assumption.
MR. CASEY:

10

She has been ordered off --

All right.

The assumption is

that -- that she's ordered to an isolated -QUESTION:

11

That the supervisor uses his

12

supervisor -- supervisory authority to place the employee

13

in -- in this situation, where he can then take advantage

14

of her.

15

MR. CASEY:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. CASEY:

Okay.
And does so repeatedly.
Okay.

He has acted.

He has --he

has used the authority vested in him by -- by his

employer.

20

and I believe there may well then be --

21

He has then acted on behalf of the employer,

QUESTION:

But the employer is not negligent,

22

the employer tells all their supervisors to be careful,

don't do this.

QUESTION:

All right.

Then why not, in -- in

one instance alone -- let -- let's take Justice O'Connor's

example, but change it in this respect.

He said:

You are going

You are not going to get your

10

sexual favors to me.

Isn't that sufficient to create at

11

least the hostile environment?

12

MR. CASEY:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CASEY:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. CASEY:

No, Your Honor.
Why not?
Because it -What could be more hostile than that?
Because he -- he -- he has one --

well, in terms of the hostile environment, Your Honor,

appeal have routinely held that a single incident --

20

QUESTION:

Oh, quite.

But -- but the -- the

21

point of the single incident cases, as I understand them,

22

is that there's a certain amount of -- of necessary rough

23

give and take in life.

or two employees in a company who occasionally make a

25

remark -- the one-incident case to be literal about it --

And the fact that there may be one

1

does not suffice to modify the entire environment to the

2

point where a discrimination can be inferred.
But when one is talking about a supervisor, with

3
4

the undoubted authority, in effect, to -- to change the

5

entire future of a given employee in that company, and

6

that supervisor is explicit about it, nothing is left to

7

chance, it seems to me that the -- that the -- the very

8

power of the employer, the explicitness of what he does in

9

-- in this hypothetical should -- should be enough,

10

whereas one remark from a fellow employee wouldn't be

11

enough.

12

MR. CASEY:

For liability -- Your Honor, for

13

liability, for an employer to attach in an hostile work

14

environment, there has to be some -- some indication to

15

the employer that he knew -- the employer knew or should

16

have known.

17

QUESTION:

But why -- why not?

Why, if -- if in

18

a series of cases the employer is going to be liable

19

because the supervisor has been authorized, has been given

20

a particular power and repeatedly abuses it, so that the

21

abuse is clear, why shouldn't the employer, by a parity of

22

reasoning, be liable when the abuse is equally clear when

23

it is made very explicitly clear in -- in one instance?

24
25

MR. CASEY:

Because, Your Honor, in -- in the --

in the example --or the hypothetical that Your Honor

1

posits, the supervisor has done nothing but speak words.

2

He has not exer --

3

QUESTION:

Well, but he has done nothing in

4

Justice O'Connor's hypo except speak words, except that he

5

has done so somewhat less explicitly than he does in my

6

case.

7

he means what he says.

8

same inference can be drawn after the first instance.

So it may take a while to make it very clear that

MR. CASEY:

But in -- in my case, the -- the

On the contrary, Your Honor, in

10

Justice O'Connor's hypothetical, as I understood it,

11

the -- the supervisor repeatedly ordered the employee off

12

to a isolated place where -- where he could then take

13

advantage of the employee.
QUESTION:

14

And -- and it's the acting --

But she resisted.

She resisted every

15

time.

16

where do you put that case?

17

in order to get the promotion, then you would say we don't

18

have to prove negligence; is that correct?

1

It was awful for her, but she resisted.

MR. CASEY:

What --

I assume that if she succumbs

Your Honor, in a -- in a submission

20

case, I would -- I would argue that, in a submission case,

21

that if the employee reasonably believed that submission

22

was a term and condition of employment, I believe then

23

there would be strict liability -- if she reasonably

24

believed --

25

QUESTION:

Okay.

Now she reasonably -- she

1

reasonably believes that it's going to be very hard to put

2

up resistance, but she's going to do it.

3

believes that she's got to resist this.

4

And in those two cases, as far as the employer is

5

concerned, there's no more likelihood that the employer

6

will know about one situation than the other, is there?

7

But you told me that if she succumbs, then there's

8

liability.

And she does.

And if she doesn't, then what?
MR. CASEY:

9

She reasonably

10

modify my answer, but if I can clarify my answer on -- on

11

the submission.

have here, where there is a clear policy against sexual

13

harassment, where there are avenues of redress which --

14

which -- in which you can avoid the complaint --

complaining through the offending supervisor, as is this

correct.

the game is that there was a policy.

Court's guidance in Meritor, that there were avenues of

redress in which one could avoid the -- the -- the

the Respondent in this case was aware of the policy,

We know, one, there was

We know, two, in -- in -- in following this

And, three, we know that -- that

10

understood the policy, and intentionally -- intentionally

11

did not follow the policy.

12

she didn't tell her -QUESTION:

And in fact stated the reason

That there was a policy and she didn't use it.

17

we really can't go beyond the summary judgment record.

that there was a policy and the fact that she didn't use

it.

MR. CASEY:

We don't

It may be that she
But

Your -- Your Honor, and -- and I'm

22

not going beyond the summary judgment record.

23

what she testified to -- and it -- and it is part of the

she intentionally did not report it to her supervisor

What she --

referring to?

And we do
Where is that?

What are you

What testimony?

MR. CASEY:

That's in the record, Your Honor,

6

at -- I will find it, Your Honor.

7

clearly in the record, and it's quoted directly in our

8

brief.

9

QUESTION:

But it is -- it is

What -- what is the relationship

10

between your reasonably believe standard and the standard

11

either of employer negligence or, for that matter,

12

employer strict liability?

13

MR. CASEY:

14

QUESTION:

I -- I don't understand.
Well, I understood you to say a

15

moment ago, in response to Justice Ginsburg's variant on

16

the question, that if the employee reasonably believed

17

that he could carry out -- that the employer could carry

18

out threats, even though those threats had not at that

19

point been carried out, that there would be a hostile

20

environment.

21

relationship between that standard and the standard of

22

employer negligence?

23

MR. CASEY:

And I -- I was going to say, what is the

can't tell whether it would be reasonable for the worker

I think

1

that on this record, more was alleged than one statement.

2

And sum -- enough was alleged to resist summary judgment.

3

What we have in this case, after all, is the initial

statement, I can make life difficult for you; then, I'm

Why does the threat -- why does the

QUESTION:

2

this, I'll do that.

3

They're not saying, Unless you do
They're saying --

MS. UNDERWOOD:

They are, in each case, imposing

a new term or condition on employment by reason of race,

in -- in the hypotheticals that you've posed.

6

QUESTION:

Right.

7

QUESTION:

So the threat makes no difference?

8

MS. UNDERWOOD:

9

But the problem --

No, the threat -- the threat can

be the mechanism by which the new condition is imposed.

10

And in this case, and in other sexual harassment cases, it

everyone -- and other people in the work place to whom

QUESTION:

But how do you judge that just on the

5

basis of the threat alone?

6

you how you factor in the existence of a policy that this

kind of thing shouldn't happen and this is how you

8

complain when it does?

9

MS. UNDERWOOD:

I mean, we -- and let me ask

Well, in general, it seems to me

10

a good complaint procedure will serve many functions.

11

is that it will prevent some violations.

12

prompt reporting will tend to corroborate the plaintiff,

13

and failure to use it will tend to raise questions about

14

her credibility.

15

QUESTION:

One

Another is that

But -- but strict liability, which is

16

what you're arguing for, will not encourage that.

17

liability for a hostile work environment, say, or for a

18

quid pro quo, say, if we were going to make a distinction,

19

does -- does not encourage use of grievance procedures.

20

It encourages laying back and filing a lawsuit.

21

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Strict

Well, I don't -- it's not so

22

clear that that's so.

Because one consequence of laying

23

back and filing a lawsuit is to minimize, to reduce the

24

credibility of the plaintiff who says that something

25

happened but never complained to anybody about it.

The reason, if I understand your argument, that
