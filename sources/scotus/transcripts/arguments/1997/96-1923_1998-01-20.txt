Mr. Ayer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. AYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

Section 523(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code creates

12

an exception to discharge for individual bankruptcies

13

applicable to, quote, debts for money, property, services,

14

or extensions of credit to the extent obtained by fraud.

15

The required fraud under that section includes

16

not only representations that are consciously false, but

17

also reckless false statements, and the issue in this case

18

is whether this exception reaches beyond the amounts

19

actually obtained by the debtor to except from discharge a

20

treble damage award ordered for reckless fraud.

21

fraud involves intentional falsehoods and results in

22

wilful and malicious injury, the damages, punitive and

23

otherwise, are nondischargeable under a different section,

24

523(a) (6) .

25

QUESTION:

Where the

MR. AYER:

We do.

2

QUESTION:

So then you would have a lack of

3

parallelism between the section you're addressing here and

4

subsections

(4)

and subsection (6).

MR. AYER:

5

We would Your Honor and,

in fact, we

6

think that's quite clear from the language,

that the

7

structure of the 523 sections as they work, given the

8

literal reading of 523(a)(2), works quite well.

9

is a provision which, by its terms,

523(a)(2)

is directed to the

10

actual fruits of the fraud.

It's a simple,

11

directive that tells people,

if they commit fraud, what

12

they get by the fraud will not be discharged.
QUESTION:

13

clear

Would that include accounting -- if

15

the property that he steals, are those profits

recoverable?

23

reasonable interpretation is to focus upon the amounts

obtained by the act of the fraud, which I would think most

25

immediately would be the amounts obtained in the fraud.

What is very -QUESTION:

So you think it wouldn't even include

3

attorney's fees and costs in the very action in which the

4

recovery is made?

5

MR. AYER:

I think it would not, Your Honor.

I

6

think that the other provisions, the (a)(6) provision in

7

particular, which this Court will address tomorrow in the

8

Geiger case, is a provision which is generally applicable,

9

essentially, among other things, to all torts, and it sets

10

a standard which says wilful and -- a debt for wilful and

11

malicious injury.

12

That has been interpreted reasonably, we think,

13

to include punitive damages, to include other penalty

14

sums, to include consequential damages, to include

15

contractually arranged-for attorney's fees, and is a

16

reasonable and uniform way of dealing with what I'll call

17

damages and consequential payments that are owed.

18

Our --

19

QUESTION:

Your answer to Justice O'Connor, it

20

seems to me, follows easily from the answer you gave me.

I think attorney's fees are even further removed --

Right.

Correct, Your Honor.

gains.

2

MR. AYER:

3

Now, one interesting result of our

4

interpretation, and it actually is played out in some

5

detail in a decision cited in the Solicitor General's

6

brief, a Tenth Circuit case, In re Gerlach, is that

7

actually the amount awarded under (a)(2), when you focus

8

on the act of fraud and what is obtained, may actually

9

exceed, in some cases, the damages that are otherwise

Correct.

10

owing, and in that sense it seems it is a very rational

11

and sensible message to people who may commit fraud.

12

QUESTION:

Say that again.

13

MR. AYER:

Well, in the context -- specifically,

14

the context in Gerlach was a context where the operator of

15

a business selling heavy equipment, selling John Deere

16

tractors, initially got an extension of credit from John

17

Deere, legitimately, but later on they got an extension of

18

that credit by submitting false invoices to show they were

19

doing business that they weren't doing.

20

The Court in Gerlach said that the later

21

extensions of credit involved the obtaining of money by

22

fraud, and as a result the entire amount of the debt that

23

was owed was, in fact, covered by (a)(2), even though

24

there might in that case be no damages at all, so I -- the

25

only point I want to make is that our point is that in

2

(a)(2) you're dealing with what was obtained.
The other sections under the code,

(a)(6) but

3

also others, also (a)(4), also (a) (11) , other -- others

4

deal with money that is gained by fraud, and they set up a

5

different logic.

6

debt is for, the injury, and the injury is interpreted

7

broadly, and --

8

9

The logic is, what did you -- what the

QUESTION:

How does Gerlach work?

In other

words, the Bankruptcy Code supersedes State tort law on

10

the measure of recovery for fraud, in the John Deere case

11

that you're describing.

12

MR. AYER:

I think the net result is that -- is

13

that it -- to whatever extent there is a debt it would be

14

nondischargeable under (a)(2) if it is

15

QUESTION:

Ah, to the extent there is a debt.

16

MR. AYER:

Well, there has to be a debt,

17

obviously, but it may, in fact, be a debt that is larger

18

than the amount that is damages as a result of the fraud.

19

I guess that's the point that I want to make.

20

Back briefly to the facts of this case, which I

21

think are important.

The respondents here are some of the

22

tenants of an 18-unit apartment building that was owned by

23

the petitioner and his father between 1985 and 1989.

24

their apartment rental business failed in the late

25

eighties as a result of falling real estate values,

1

petitioner filed bankruptcy under Chapter 7.

2

Thereafter, the rent control administrator

3

entered an order to the effect that there had been an

4

overcharge of these tenants which amounted to $31,000 and

5

the bankruptcy court held that the overcharge was

6

nondischargeable under the (a)(2) provision.

7

The court found further that actual fraud

8

existed in that case on the ground that the act of

9

charging rents was itself an implicit representation of

10

their legality and, second, that petitioner's recklessness

11

in failing to determine what the correct rents were was

12

sufficient to establish an intent to deceive and, finally,

13

the bankruptcy court held that because the overcharges

14

amounted to fraud, treble damages were appropriate under

15

the New Jersey consumer fraud statute and then found that

16

that amount, indeed, also was nondischargeable.

17

Our view is, as is apparent already, I guess,

18

that that result is wrong.

19

three reasons:

20

which talks about debts for money, property, services,

21

extensions of credit to the extent obtained by fraud

22

clearly doesn't include the amounts that are punitive in

23

nature --

25

It's wrong essentially for

QUESTION:

Do you rely on the phrase, to the

extent?

7

We think that -- there's been

8

a discussion back and forth in this case about whether to

9

the extent modifies money, property, services, or whether

10

it modifies debt.

I think everyone agrees -- in this

11

case, at least, agrees that it modifies money, property,

12

services.
Our difference, I think, is that -- how we

13
14

understand the word for.

I think

10

that the interpret -- the language prior to 1984 was

11

language that said, debt for obtaining money, property, et

13

language.

14

Now, we think that's ambiguous

There are a couple of cases, literally only a

15

couple, that held necessarily that that language does, in

16

fact, reach punitive amounts, and we don't think that it

17

is illogical to reach that result, but what is important

18

is that prior to 1984 and prior to 1978 even more so,

19

there was -- there were not occasions that came up that

20

made courts decide this issue.

21
22

The main reason is that with the presence of the
(a)(6) language that talks about debts for wilful and

23

malicious injury, with that language being there, any time

24

conduct results in wilful and malicious injury, it doesn't

25

matter what (a)(2) means, or what is now (a)(2) means.

1

It doesn't matter what it means to have a debt

2

for obtaining, and so courts in deciding these cases, as

3

we talk in some detail about in footnotes 13 and 14 of our

4

reply brief, of the yellow brief, the courts typically

5

didn't focus specifically on the meaning of that prior

6

language.

7

possible to say here, as the Court has said in a number of

8

cases, there was an important pre-1978, or pre-1984

9

bankruptcy practice that had been established.

10
11

They didn't have a reason to, and so it isn't

Indeed,

there was no clear practice that had been established.
It is not our mission here to tell you that the

12

meaning of those words, if it mattered what the pre-'78

13

words meant and you didn't have (a)(6) and you had to

14

decide, might a court decide that they in fact meant to

15

include punitive damages.

16

Maybe they did.

It isn't clear.

I would only

17

say that, when reviewing -- what you review Justice Breyer

18

for the Court's opinion in the O'Gilvie case, which talks

19

about, under the different statute, under the IRS statute,

20

whether damages on account of personal injury, whether

21

those include punitive damages, and the Court ruled that

22

they did not, if that is an admissible result, it seems to

23

me it's certainly admissible to conclude -- one could

24

conclude that -- that a debt for obtaining money by fraud

25

doesn't include it.

Our only point is that it was ambiguous.

case that we're aware of, a Ninth Circuit case called

5

QUESTION:

Why isn't that function of (6) still

6

applicable?

7

the question irrelevant then and not make it irrelevant

8

now.

9

I mean, I don't understand why (6) would make

MR. AYER:

It is still applicable, Your Honor,

10

and I think that it is true that this case and this

11

Court's decision in this case is only going to be

12

determinative in the group of cases -- and I debated

13

whether to characterize it as the sliver of cases or a

14

larger group of cases, but the group of cases that

15

involves conduct that is fraudulent, meaning it's at least

16

reckless, but it falls short of being wilful and

17

malicious.

18

QUESTION:

Then Mr. Ayer, you would concede that

19

your argument leads to the result that is suggested in the

20

Solicitor General's brief at page 21.

produce nondischargeability of punitive damages only where

2

the conduct is found wilful and malicious.
QUESTION:

3
4

So that if it isn't wilful and

malicious, just reckless --

5

MR. AYER:

Right.

6

QUESTION:

-- then the result is $5,000 and not

7

what it cost to rebuild the plane.

8

MR. AYER:

That is correct.

9

QUESTION:

It is clear to you that wilful and

10

malicious does not include reckless?

Punitive damages I

11

had always thought were only given for intentional torts,

12

and yet they're given for recklessness.

13

MR. AYER:

Well --

14

QUESTION:

I assume they're given for

15

recklessness because it amounts to wilful and malicious,

16

as it does in the criminal law.

I mean, that I think is some part of

22

the question pending in the Geiger case which will be

23

argued tomorrow, and it has been our understanding from

24

reading the cases that we're aware of that two things are

25

clear under the law.

One is that reckless misrepresentations do come

1
2

within (a)(2), that it is fraud under the Restatement and,

3

as this Court incorporated in essence the Restatement into

4

that --

5

QUESTION:

Sure they do.

6

MR. AYER:

And secondly --

7

QUESTION:

So do wilful ones, though.

8

MR. AYER:

Correct, and secondly -- I mean, our

9

best reading of the cases is that wilful and malicious

10

requires a measure of intentionality and knowing conduct

11

vis-a-vis the harm that results.

12

Now, we could be wrong about that.

It's not an

13

issue that has been raised in this case because thus far

14

no one has suggested that the conduct here was wilful and

15

malicious, and I guess I would submit that that's highly

16

unlikely, given the fact that we're dealing with implicit

17

representations based simply on the fact that he charged a

18

certain rent, and recklessness in failing to ascertain

19

what they thought the legal rent was.

20

I would think that would be hard to find wilful

21

and malicious, but I will not attempt to define, you know,

22

the case, the outcome of the case tomorrow.

23

QUESTION:

I think you may have the better view

24

in a close question on the reading of (a)(2), but I'm

concerned about the lack of parallelism with (4) and (6),

which is what we've been addressing -- addressing here.

2

If you prevail, there are going to be cases that

3

might be classified under this section or section -- the

4

section on malicious conduct, and then we'd have to decide

5

whether it falls under this -- the -MR. AYER:

6

Well, I mean, our understanding of

7

the statute as it now reads is that there are several

8

provisions that make nondischargeable various damages.

9

would submit that the (a)(2) provision is essentially not

We

10

a damages -- it doesn't deal with damages.

It deals with

11

the specific act of obtaining something by fraud and it

12

says, no, you're going to be stuck with that if you got it

13

by fraud.

14

The other provisions, the (a)(4) provision

15

relates to fraud by a fiduciary, among other things.

16

(a)(11) provision is a special provision enacted with

17

regard to fraud in the context of federally insured

18

institutions and (a)(6), dealing with wilful and

19

malicious, as the Court suggested in footnote 2 of the

20

Grogan decision, that might be, the Court said there --

21

didn't try to decide the issue, but suggested that that

22

might be a sensible place to focus the discussion of

23

whether or not fraudulent conduct is wilful.

24
25

The

So the lack of parallelism I would submit is the
product of the fact that (a)(2) is looking at something

1

else.

(a)(2) is looking at the act, the obtaining, and

2

saying no, you can't keep that, and the rest of it

3

creates, you know, frankly I would say a uniform and

4

sensible system.

5

If the line that's to be drawn as a matter of

6

policy is that nondischargeability comes when conduct gets

7

bad enough that you can say it's wilful and malicious,

8

then why should fraudulent conduct be any different than

9

other kinds of tortious conduct?

10

Why would you single

that out?
They've already singled out the act of obtaining

11
12

by fraud.

That's important.

That's a significant thing.

13

But why should we reach in and say -- why should the court

14

reach in and say, well, we know it only really matters

15

when you have reckless fraud, and we know that it's going

16

to make nondischargeable statutory treble damage awards

17

such as in this case where somebody acts by an implicit

18

representation based on reckless failure to determine

19

facts.
That's really -- the situation of reckless fraud

20
21

is the only one where this case -- I think it's the only

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Ayer, your question presented in

2

this case is phrased in terms of punitive damages and yet,

3

as I read them, none of the statutory sections we're

4

talking about refer to punitive damages.

5

MR. AYER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

We use

6

that phrase, rightly or wrongly, as a generic reference to

7

include not only common law punitive awards and statutory

8

treble damage awards -- is that addressing your question?

9

We don't mean by punitives to focus only on the

10

amount of jury awards as a punitive damage award in the

11

conventional sense.

12

QUESTION:

Then what do you mean by it?

13

MR. AYER:

Well, we mean to encompass awards

14

that are in the nature of a penalty.

15

specifically assumed for purposes of this case, without

16

deciding, that the treble damage penalty -- treble damage

17

award in this case, the trebling, was solely for punitive

18

purposes.

19

QUESTION:

The court below

But now, supposing in an action, an

20

ordinary tort action for fraud, ordinary damages or

21

benefit-of-the-bargain damages are recovered.

23

MR. AYER:

What would

Well, our view would be that the

24

(a)(2) provision should be read in accordance with its

25

terms and that would mean that the amount that the debtor

The benefit-of-the-bargain damages may or may

not equal that.

factual

You can conjure up all sorts of different

5

QUESTION:

They might be greater.

6

MR. AYER:

They might be greater.

As I

7

indicated before, they might conceivably be less and I

8

guess the affirmative point vis-a-vis (a)(2) is that, in

9

doing what Congress said in this statute, they've created

10

a very clear statement, we think, and a clear statement

11

that is important as a -- essentially a wall against

12

fraudulent conduct.

got it by fraud, you don't get to keep it.

QUESTION:

It's a directive that says, if you've

Correct, and nor on, indeed, whether

there are damages, whether there have been found to be

us.

punitive award, but it seems to me it also makes a

2

difference when there isn't recklessness and the issue is

3

whether you only get back under (a)(2) the money that the

4

person -- or whether there is covered by (a)(2) only the

5

money that the person received, or also there is covered

6

whatever profits are made from that money, which often

7

happens.

8

MR. AYER:

Well, I -- that --

9

QUESTION:

And frankly that's the part of your

10
11

interpretation that troubles me more than the other one.
MR. AYER:

Well, that is -- I mean, in all

12

honesty, Your Honor, that is a possible extension of

13

the -- of our reading of it that I will say in all honesty

14

had not occurred to me, but it's a possibility, that in

15

other words it is possible, perhaps, to say that you got

16

this money by fraud and then you got profits by fraud,

17

but -- you got profits from that money and therefore all

18

of that was obtained by fraud and I must say, I think

19

that's -- that is an interpretation which I do think could

20

be reasonable in the context --

21

QUESTION:

And that's where the distinction

22

would be between the profits, which under this

23

interpretation would be recoverable, and attorney's fees

24

and costs incurred in recovering it, which is not

25

recoverable.

MR. AYER:

Right.

I mean, I think that -- I

2

think that punitive damages, I think that consequential

3

damages, I think that other damages which do not grow

4

directly from what was obtained clearly are not

5

encompassed within (a)(2), and that you deal with those

damage issues in the context of either (a)(6) or one of

7

the other special sort of egregious wrong provisions that

8

are in --

9

QUESTION:

Okay.

But you think that any funds

10

that are actually received by the defendant could be

11

regarded as obtained by the fraud.
MR. AYER:

12

13

I think that's a reasonable reading,

Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

Is -- did -- am I right in thinking

15

you've looked through the legislative history of the 1984

16

amendments, you've read the reports, you've looked at the

17

floor statements, et cetera, and you couldn't find

18

anything as to any reason why Congress made the linguistic

change.

There is a one-sentence reference

that talks about the change being stylistic.

which I made before and that is, the prior language never

2

needed to be and in fact I would submit, looking at our

3

footnotes 13 and 14, never was definitively interpreted

4

the way Your Honor has indicated, but the most important

5

reason is that -- well, I won't say the most im -- I think

6

the most important reason is the words of the statute.

7

Beyond the words of the statute and the

8

structure and the lack of a prior clear precedent, all of

9

which we submit is dispositive, there is the very

10

important fact that this whole set of provisions, 523(a),

11

is a set of exceptions to discharge that applies only in

12

the context of individual bankruptcies.

13

More than 90 percent of individual bankruptcies

14

are now consumer bankruptcies relating to consumer debts,

15

and what we know is that Congress in 1978 was

16

substantially concerned about the problems of the

17

ineffectiveness of the bankruptcy process vis-a-vis

18

consumer debtors, was concerned about overreaching

19

creditors, was concerned about creditors who were

20

aggressively asserting positions using the nondischarge

21

provision specifically referred to by this Court in Field

22

v. Mans, talking in terms of the financial statement

provisions and the abuses by such creditors.

QUESTION:

Mr. Ayer,

(a)(4) says in effect that

a discharge does not discharge a debtor from any debt for

fraud while acting in a fiduciary capacity.

6

is no language about money, or property, or to the extent

There, there

8

MR. AYER:

Correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

So under (a)(4) would punitives be

10

recoverable and attorney's fees and so forth.

11

MR. AYER:

12

Correct, they have.

13

QUESTION:

They have been so held, Your Honor.

And in the petition for certiorari

14

filed on behalf of your client on page 9, footnote 4, it

15

says resort to legislative history is unnecessary, given

16

the plain language and, prior to 1984,

17

discharge of a debt for obtaining money by fraud, which

18

courts construed to bar discharge of both compensatory and

19

punitive damages in fraud cases, and that's language from

2

In fact, the precise language that was used in

3

the amendment was taken from a case, In re Danns, a Second

4

Circuit case, which discussed that very issue, noted that

5

there was a conflict in authority, and held that in a

6

situation where a debtor obtains money through a legal

7

credit transaction and then subsequently commits an act of

8

fraud and then obtains additional money through a

9

refinancing, the amount of money that gives rise to the

10

debt is the amount obtained through fraud, but it's the

11

debt which is nondischargeable, and the debt has been

12

defined and is still defined by the code as the liability

13

on a claim.

14

The liability on a claim is the amount that you

I understand this.

The credit card company says Smith

12

went bankrupt, and Smith owes me $50,000, so my claim as

13

the credit card company is, I have a claim -- I say Smith

14

is liable on my claim for $50,000.

15

Now, $20,000 of that he obtained by fraud, so I

have a claim for 50, and that claim for 50 is fraud -- is

17

for fraud to the extent of 20,000.

18

MR. DIEBOLD:

19

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And your position, your view is that

20

that claim is a claim for fraud to the extent of $20,000,

21

and any liability on that claim for $20,000 is liability

22

on a claim to the extent obtained by fraud.

23

liability on that portion of the claim $20,000 is $100,000

MR. DIEBOLD:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. DIEBOLD:

4

The $100,000 is nondischargeable.

And the case that said all that is?
In re Danns made the distinction

between those.

5

Now, in addition to that we have the --

6

QUESTION:

Well,

I'm not sure how Danns helps

7

you, because in Danns it was just the first part of

8

Justice Breyer's hypothetical, as I recall the case, the

9

$20,000 and the $30,000, and they said that the $20,000

10

that was obtained by fraud, that is nondischargeable, not

11

the 30, or am I misreading the case?
MR. DIEBOLD:

12

No, Your Honor is misreading -- is

13

not misreading the case, but the -- Danns did not involve

14

the imposition of a trebling punitive factor, but the --

15

what Danns did hold is that the statutes permitted the

16

discharge of that portion of the debt which was not

17

obtained by fraud.

18

QUESTION:

So that the debt is severable for

19

purpose of applying the dischargeability provisions, which

20

is what the petitioner is saying, or am I misstating?
MR. DIEBOLD:

21

I respectfully think that Your

22

Honor is.

23

both agree that the statute permits a severing of that

24

obtained legally and that obtained by fraud.

of treble damages or other penalties or punitive damages

3

Honor's hypothetical would be the $20,000.

4

QUESTION:

Am I correct that in your answer to

5

Justice Breyer's question you were assuming that debt or

6

claim and money are synonymous, but it seems to me that

7

under the statute they're not synonymous.

8

certain debts or claims, and those debts or claims may to

9

some extent represent money obtained, so that if you

There are

10

recognize the distinction between claim on the one hand

11

and the money that may or may not be represented by that

12

claim on the other hand, you would have to answer

13

differently, wouldn't you?

14
15

MR. DIEBOLD:

Well, I'm not sure I'm

following --

16

QUESTION:

You would have to -- you would have

17

to say that if you recognize the distinction you simply

18

cannot amalgamate money obtained by fraud and damages

19

assessed with respect to that money obtained by fraud and

20

that, it seems to me, is what you consistently do in your

21

argument.

22

and yet the statute seems not to do that.

23
24
25

You do identify or amalgamate those two things

MR. DIEBOLD:

Well, except that the statute

defines debt as a liability on a claim.

Mm-hmm.

MR. DIEBOLD:

And in this case the liability on

2

the respondent's claim was, under New Jersey law, three

3

times the amount of the money obtained by fraud.

4

QUESTION:

Which means that part of the claim

5

represents money obtained and part of the claim represents

6

something else.

7

MR. DIEBOLD:

Well, if I can use an example to I

8

think answer what I believe to be Your Honor's question,

9

let's assume that in this case the legal rent is $500 and

10

the landlord had a good faith reasonable belief that the

11

rent was $600, but he decided to tack on another $100

12

because he thought he could get away with it.

13

What we're saying is that the amount between

14

$500 and $600 would be fully dischargeable.

15

between $600 and $700 is the amount that he obtained by

16

fraud but that -- but the debt that that obtaining would

17

create would be $300 under New Jersey law.

QUESTION:

But the statute does not, in terms,

speak in subsection (2)(A) of debts, it speaks of money.

purpose.

Do you concede that as long as you make the

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Let me try it another way.

10
11

No, I don't concede that.

I think

I'm asking the same question.
It seems to me perfectly reasonable to add on

the trebling in those sections that speak of any debt for

fraud, for wilful and malicious injury, when they talk

14

about a debt for the wrongful act.

Anything that you get

But when they're using claim in the other way,

or debt in the other way -- that is, a liability for a

wrongful debt.

When it says debt for money to the extent

11

MR. DIEBOLD:

I think as a matter of grammar

12

that's a possible interpretation, but to reach that

13

conclusion, Your Honor would have to assume that in 1984

14

Congress intended to change what was I believe concededly

15

the -- at least the majority position that punitive

16

damages under (a)(2) were not dischargeable.

I don't think that it's reasonable to assume

No.

Are you saying that the petitioner,

Mr. Ayer, is interpreting debt differently in (2) and in
(6) ?

MR. DIEBOLD:

QUESTION:

Yes.

Because in (2) you look at it from

you look at it from what the standpoint of what the

That would be my

2

QUESTION:

That is to say, and this is the same

3

question, that debt means claim as further defined

5

MR. DIEBOLD:

I don't think that the language,

6

the operative language in section (2) is attempting to

7

further define debt, though.

8

petitioner concedes that the holding in the Levy case,

9

which held that the phrase modified debt, is correct.

I think that even the

I

10

think that what Congress was intending to do, as was shown

11

by the 1978 legislative report that's quoted at page 19 of

12

the Solicitor General's brief, is to distinguish between

13

how that debt was obtained.

14

The entire structure of the -- of 523 is to

define or list certain types of conduct for which debts

will not be dischargeable.

17

that gives rise to a nondischargeable debt under (a)(2) is

that conduct which is fraudulent.

Congress could have written this a little better but the

this statute and how it operates significantly in the way

that the petitioner wishes you to read it without some

that what Congress did in 1984 was stop and say, okay, but

repeated credit transactions in which some portion of

credit is obtained by fraud and some portion is not.

5

What has

Before 1970 there was a split in the courts on

6

whether or not the full amount of credit was

7

nondischargeable simply because a small portion thereof

8

had been obtained by fraud, and that's the In re Danns

9

decision.
The legislative history in 1978 shows that

10
11

Congress was aware of this issue.

12

language added in 1984 is most reasonably read as making

13

it unmistakably clear that there must be a parsing process

14

to determine how much was obtained by fraud, how much was

15

not obtained by fraud, and all of the liability on a claim

16

for the portion that was obtained by fraud is

17

nondischargeable, and that liability may include

18

consequential and punitive damages.

short phrase, I guess, that debt for money means exactly

to the fraudulent means of obtaining it, by a later

phrase.

MR. LAMKEN:

That is absolutely correct.

2

Lawyers often refer to a claim by what caused the claim to

3

arise, and sometimes by the result.

4

claim for personal injury, the result, or we might speak

5

of a claim for battery, what caused the injury.

6

We might speak of a

In the context of this statute, Congress has

7

used those two interchangeably, as lawyers often do.

8

Sometimes they spoke of a debt for fraud, the action that

9

produced the injury, or a debt for wilful and malicious

10

injury, the result.
In our portion, in (a)(2), it says a debt for

11
12

money, property, or services to the extent obtained by

13

fraud, the result, but that does not alter the amount of

14

liability, necessarily.

amount which would be imposed by a State court and that

16

amount, in this case, is three times the injury so

imposed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER

MR. AYER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

2

I just want to make one point, and it relates to

3

Justice Breyer's hypothetical about the credit card

4

situation.

5

I would submit that a broad reading of this

6

provision here so as to essentially use the prior

7

language, read broadly, as it's read in (a)(6), reading

8

debt for obtaining money by fraud creates -- that broad

9

reading to include all essentially consequential,

10

punitive, and other damages would create a situation where

11

a credit card company who could come in and argue reckless

12

fraud with regard to the $20,000 that was spent, and then

13

can argue $30,000 more in interest at 18 percent under

14

their contract and then can argue another $10,000 in

15

attorney's fees, that in that circumstance they can come

16

in and make a credible, if not a winning argument that in

17

fact all of that is something that's entitled to

18

nondischarge.
Now, that is something that's a real life issue.

19
20

I would direct the Court, if it's interested, to the 1997

21

National Bankruptcy Review Commission report.
QUESTION:

22

You don't want them to get the

23

interest.

24

the person got, and he gets it interest-free, right?

25

You mean, all they can get is the $20,000 that

correct, that they get the -- well, they may get a market

2

interest.

3

would submit is --

Whether they get a contractual interest rate I

4

QUESTION:

Why even the market interest rate?

5

MR. AYER:

Well, I'm sorry.

The measure under

6

Justice Scalia's hypothetical earlier would be the benefit

7

that -- and I think it may be correct -- the benefit that

8

was obtained by the debtor, not the amount that's

9

contractually owed to the credit card company.
QUESTION:

10

Could I get you to comment on one

11

question that came up in your opponent's argument?

The

12

prior law is uncertain, you say, but what about the 1898

13

statute?

That was perfectly clear, wasn't it?
MR. AYER:

The 1898 statute talked about

QUESTION:

Right.

17

MR. AYER:

It talked about judgments, and --

18

QUESTION:

Which would necessarily include the

20

judgments.

punitive -MR. AYER:

Well, if that language were

21

transported to today, when punitive damages is an issue,

22

which really only started in a big way in the 1970's, that

23

may well be where the Court would come out.

24
25

The fact is, no one has come up with a case
construing that language.
