ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. CANADAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Rejecting Joseph Oncale's title VII claims, the

11
12

Fifth Circuit stated, same-sex harassment claims are not

13

cognizable under title VII.

14

through this appeal is whether the Fifth Circuit's

15

categorical rejection of same-sex claims under title VII

is correct.

We argue that it is not.

be reversed.

3

It is an

Both sides to this litigation agree that women

4

are entitled to the protections of title VII, but to

5

accept the Fifth Circuit rule is to accept the proposition

6

that a woman's right to work in an environment free of

7

unwelcome sexual conduct, or sexual solicitation, turns on

8

the sex of her harasser.

9

interpreted by the Fifth Circuit.

11

QUESTION:

I thought this case involved a man.

12

MR. CANADAY:

It does, Your Honor.

This case

13

does involve a man, but I emphasize that the Fifth

14

Circuit's ruling is not a male-on-male decision, it is a

15

same-sex decision, and I emphasize that to point out the

16

breadth of the Fifth Circuit's categorical and absolute

17

rule that same-gender sexual harassment claims, regardless

18

of the genders, as long as they're identical, and

19

regardless of the underlying facts, would, under the Fifth

20

Circuit's rule, be dismissed as a matter of law, but Your

21

Honor, you're exactly correct, this is a male-on-male

22

situation, but the court did not decide the case on that

23

fact except to recognize that the genders of the two

24

parties, the harasser and the victim, were the same.

25

So to accept the Fifth Circuit's rule, then, is

1

to agree that the sex of the harasser defines the scope of

2

title VII.

3

QUESTION:

Not necessarily.

I mean, you could

4

say if the harasser, whoever he or she is, treats members

5

of one sex, whether the same sex as the harasser or the

6

opposite sex, differently, you could -- so you -- if you

7

have a difference of -- in treatment by the perpetrator of

8

males and females, that's one thing.

9

So I don't think that the Fifth Circuit has

10

ruled quite as broadly as you suggest.

11

male perpetrator and a male victim.
MR. CANADAY:

12

You could have a

Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit has

13

ruled categorically that if there is a male victim and a

14

male perpetrator they do not look at the underlying facts

15

or circumstances of the harassment.

16

matter of law that same-gender causes of actions do not

17

exist.

18

They decided as a

The Fifth Circuit's rule would be equally

19

applicable were this a woman-on-woman case.

20

it is male-on-male --

21

QUESTION:

The fact that

But my point is, this was an all-

22

male environment, too, and wasn't that -- don't we have to

23

take the decision in that context?

24
25

In other words, they didn't say that if you have
an employer who treats members of one sex one way and

2

claim under title VII if the victim is a male and the

3

perpetrator is a male.

4

no other sex involved in this case.

5

MR. CANADAY:

They didn't say that.

There was

That is correct, there was no

6

other sex involved, but that factual determination is not

7

the foundation of the Fifth Circuit's rule.

8

Circuit's rule is a categorical rule.

The Fifth Circuit

in fact did not discern or consider the underlying

circumstances or the maleness of the workplace.

QUESTION:

you're not asking us to decide whether or not there was

17

prevent there from having been discrimination.

\

MR. CANADAY:

18

You're simply asking us to

correct, because my case was thrown out as a matter of

2

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may find for the

3

plaintiff if, what?

4

What does a judge tell the jury?

MR. CANADAY:

We would prevail if the jury was

5

instructed that sexual harassment is a cognizable form of

6

discrimination based on sex.

7

instructed on the law as established in the circuits and

8

as articulated by this Court, and then the court, the

9

trier of fact could draw the reasonable inference -- well,

The jury could then be

10

first of all, under the facts alleged the trier of fact

11

could determine that Joseph Oncale was quid pro -- the

12

victim of quid pro quo sexual harassment, or the trier of

13

fact, under the facts as they currently stand, could find

14

that Joseph Oncale was victimized of a hostile sexual

15

environment.

that discrimination because of sex, as defined by this

Court in the Meritor case, did in fact occur, yes, sir.

2

MR. CANADAY:

3

QUESTION:

Well, on the facts --

Or, in your case, if we could change

4

the facts a little bit, if almost the same conduct was

5

perpetrated against both sexes by this supervisor?
MR. CANADAY:

6

If it is the off-color, or the

7

poor joke case, Your Honor, I believe the argument then

8

would be, or the issue then would be whether or not the
severity or pervasiveness of the conduct raised the

10

level -QUESTION:

11
12

Well, you know what I'm trying to

say.

13

MR. CANADAY:

Yes, sir.

14

If the facts were that the -- all employees of

15

both genders are treated equally, the equal opportunity

16

harasser -- first of all, let me emphasize that's not this

17

case.

18

QUESTION:

I understand.

1

MR. CANADAY:

But assume hypothetically it was,

20

then the question would be whether or not that under the

21

facts you could -- the jury could discern an attempt to

22

discriminate based on sex.

23

QUESTION:

So --

So you're saying that the other

24

sexual harasser, or the homosexual harasser is liable, but

25

the bisexual harasser is not.

MR. CANADAY:

That there is immunity for the

bisexual harasser.

MR. CANADAY:

MR. CANADAY:

12

No, sir.

That is not our position

in this case.

6

8

No.

Oh, I thought -- I thought -No, sir.

If I stated that, I

misspoke.
QUESTION:
discrimination?

Well, if not, why is there

I think that's what we're both asking.

MR. CANADAY:

In the pure -- in the true

bisexual harasser scenario, which again this case is not,

3

the court could then look at the sexual nature of the

4

conduct and could, under existing precedent, argue that

5

each victim was a victim of sexual harassment.

6

QUESTION:

No.

Each victim would have been a

7

victim of -- would have been discriminated against on the

8

basis of that person's sexuality, but not on the basis of

9

that person's sex, because it was indifferent to the

20
21

harasser whether the person was male or female.
MR. CANADAY:

But the individual claimant, Your

22

Honor, who brought the cause of action alleging that he or

23

she was the victim of sexual discrimination could

24

demonstrate that their work environment was a

25

discriminatorily hostile work environment and then,

perhaps as a matter of defense -QUESTION:

2

3

No more so than people of the other

sex.

4

MR. CANADAY:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. CANADAY:

Then that would be

That's what the person has to show.
But that would be a matter of

7

affirmative defense, would it not, not as matter of an

8

element of cause of action.

9

they are singled out for mistreatment based upon sex -QUESTION:

10
11

Yes, if they show they're singled

out.

12

MR. CANADAY:

13

QUESTION:

14

If that person shows that

singled out.

Yes.

But the point is, they haven't been

This person treats males and females alike.

15

MR. CANADAY:

16

QUESTION:

Right, and again, if that was --

I just wonder -- you know, if you

17

acknowledge that the bisexual harasser does not violate

18

this law, I just wonder how that transfers over to the

19

case that you have.

20

MR. CANADAY:

Well, I do not believe it

21

transfers over to the case that I have because the case

22

before you now is the first-step case as to whether the

23

cause of action exists and secondly, in my case, only men

24

were harassed under the situation on the Sundowner rig.

25

Only Joseph Oncale was harassed.

1

QUESTION:

No, but you don't concede as a matter

2

of law, do you, that the bisexual harasser cannot harass

3

on the basis of sex?

4

MR. CANADAY:

5

QUESTION:

That is exactly correct.

I mean, a person may be quite neutral

6

on sexuality and still in fact discriminate on the basis

7

of sex, and you're not conceding that fact.

8

MR. CANADAY:

9

QUESTION:

11
12

Okay.

MR. CANADAY:

10

Absolutely not, sir.

Your Honor.

I do not concede

that.
QUESTION:

Well, are you taking the position

13

that any harassment, provided that it's grave, fits under

14

title VII, then?

15
16

MR. CANADAY:

No, Your Honor, we're not taking

the position that any harassment --

17

QUESTION:

So what would you exclude?

18

MR. CANADAY:

Well, I believe that the

19

exclusions would be a matter of fact, whether or not it --

20

whether or not the harassment was shown as a matter of

21

fact to raise to the level of severity of the --

22

QUESTION:

Oh, let's assume that it's very

23

gross, but -- so -- and it meets all the standards of our

24

case law about it has to be pervasive and grave.

25

any category that you would then omit, or are you saying

Is there

1

that all sexual harassment, provided it meets the

2

standards of being severe and pervasive, fits under title

3

VII?

4

MR. CANADAY:

If -- assuming the harassment does

5

raise to the level of severity and pervasiveness and would

6

be recognized as sexual harassment, then our position is

7

that the gender of the harasser vis-a-vis the gender of

8

the victim is not a material fact.

9
10
11
12

QUESTION:

Well, why is that discrimination,

QUESTION:

You would agree that you also have to

show that the harasser is discriminating --

13

QUESTION:

Yes

14

QUESTION:

-- on the basis of sex, which the

15

statute says, would you not, that he is treating, or she

16

is treating one sex differently from the other?

17

MR. CANADAY:

I believe that's an essential

18

element of the cause of action, but the Fifth Circuit in

19

this case said that those circumstances could never be

20

proved in a same-gender sexual harassment claim.

21

These questions that the court have posed are

22

questions of proof, or questions of motive, but not of

23

questions of definition.

24
25

QUESTION:

No, but it's also a question of how

we're going to write the opinion.

I mean, maybe you would prevail under these

1

2

facts, but we have to understand the nature of the cause

3

of action, and we're asking you why there is

4

discrimination in some of these hypotheticals that we have

5

posed.
MR. CANADAY:

6

Your Honor, there is

7

discrimination because Joseph Oncale in this case, alone

8

among men in a workplace, was selected by his supervisor,

9

a male, to be the victim of that male supervisor's

10

unsolicited, unwanted, and obnoxious sexual advances.

11

That is sexual harassment.
QUESTION:

12

I wouldn't really call them sexual

13

advances.

It was certainly not -- a lot cruder than that,

14

but suppose -- suppose that Mr. Oncale had been hazed,

15

which is what the other side says.

16

know, good frolics, and male hazing.

This is just, you

Suppose he had been hazed in some other fashion.

17

I mean, just as obnoxious, but just not -- you know,

19

nothing to do with genitals or anything else.

You see, I find that difficult to

8

MR. CANADAY:

9

QUESTION:

Well, if --

I don't know why singling him out on

10

the basis of his sexuality means that you're singling him

11

out on the basis of his sex.

12

MR. CANADAY:

Well, I believe that what we've

13

argued in brief is that it is -- the singling out for sex-

14

specific or sex-driven conduct is one category, this

15

category, but your hypothetical --

16

QUESTION:

Why is that?

Is this a law -- I

mean, is this a dirty-word law, or something?

meant to produce politeness and --

It wasn't

19

MR. CANADAY:

Right.

20

To answer your question, though, you asked

21

earlier, Your Honor, is if the conduct was devoid of

22

sexual connotations, or didn't involve grabbing

23

Mr. Oncale's genitalia, or didn't involve use of a bar of

24

soap in a shower, as this case did, then perhaps there

independent of the facts.
But given that this man was singled out for

sexual abuse by his supervisors,

4

sexuality as a component of -- because of his sex is

inherent in the fact pattern.

QUESTION:

Well,

the component of

take Justice Scalia's

7

hypothesis that the hazing here did not involve genitals,

8

*but just very nasty treatment.

9

the supervisor, or whoever was the hazer, did not treat

women the same way given the same circumstances, then I

11

suppose you could make out a claim of discrimination.

QUESTION:

13

But just the hazing by itself, unless

14

you can show that men are treated differently than women,

15

doesn't make out a claim.
MR. CANADAY:

16

I believe if the harassing conduct

17

is nonsexual then the plaintiff would have a burden of

18

establishing a *disparity of treatment and show that

19

perhaps that supervisor didn't treat women the same way so

20

as to show the motive to -QUESTION:

of his sex.
QUESTION:

2

3

And to be discriminated against, that

is, treated differently than someone of the other sex.

4

MR. CANADAY:

5

QUESTION:

That is true.

Isn't your point here that when the

6

hazing is of the sexual nature here,

7

what went on, you make a stronger prima facie case that in

8

fact there was sex discrimination going on than you would

9

be if you were merely to prove hazing of a totally

10

nonsexual nature?

simply by proving

Isn't that the real difference?

11

MR. CANADAY:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

it is.

But theoretically your burden is the

13

same.

In this case, your burden is to prove that in fact

14

these -- the individual defendants here would not have

15

treated women the same way they were treating this man.

MR. CANADAY:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

in --

And that the employer would not have

18

reacted or have condoned this sort of treatment in a

20

have condoned it in this case.

burdens,

22

Those are your two

then.
MR. CANADAY:

23

I think, Your Honor, what --

14

Mr. Chief Justice, what I understood you to say in Meritor

15

is that sexual harassment can be equivalent to

16

discrimination if it is so severe and pervasive that it

17

changes the conditions of employment, thereby

18

discriminating against the sex being harassed.

QUESTION:

Well, sexual harassment directed in a

20

discriminatory way against a victim, but certainly we

21

didn't say that sexual harassment that was meted out

22

equally to everybody is discrimination.

there were extensive findings by Congress that there was a

disparate treatment of women in the workplace.

10

I think what a court must then

tries to deal in a way that would be workable and not

intrusive and violative of privacy, with harassment based

on sexuality or orientation.

If we were to decide, Mr. Reasoner,

we're -- that sexual harassment is a complex concept that

15

implicates many things that because of race does not.

16

QUESTION:

*Because it --

17

QUESTION:

Well, are you -- may I -- are you

18

saying that it's simply the nature of the harassment

19

rather than the nature of the discrimination against a

20

member of one sex or the other which is the crucial thing,

21

so that it comes down to a point almost of evidence?

It

1

may be because of orientation, it may be because of

2

sexuality, it may be because he doesn't like him --

3

QUESTION:

Why couldn't it be because you're not

4

the right kind of man, just as with respect to women, and

5

wasn't there, at least in one case, a statement to the

6

effect of what title VII is aimed at is getting rid of

7

stereotypical notions about the way men are or the way

8

women are, so that if you -- we know that an employer

9

can't say, as in Martin Marietta, how could I discriminate

10

against women, most of the people I hire are women, but I

11

won't take the ones who have children.

12

So if that's what title VII is about, you're not

13

the right kind of male, or you're not the right kind of

14

female, why wouldn't it fit?

15

MR. REASONER:

Well, I think Your Honor

16

illustrates the difficulty.

17

course that's discrimination.

18

that, on male-on-male relationships, that abuse, because

19

we don't like their appearance -- I mean, does it all go

20

back to sex and harassment, and I submit to you that's

21

what the Government would have you do.

22

Martin Marietta is easy.

But are we now going to say

They say to you flatly it's immaterial what the

23

motives were, and the test is tautological.

because of sex.

Man harasses a man, of course it's

25

because of sex.

What else?

He is a sex.

you go?

saying that male-on-male is bad.

sexual harassment male-on-male does not automatically

Does not

11

QUESTION:

Okay.

12

MR. REASONER:

13

QUESTION:

-- Your Honor.

But just because it does not

automatically, I don't know why that leads to the

conclusion that it does not ever, and why was a summary

judgment proper here?

17

Why shouldn't it have been left to the jury to

18

say, well, regardless of whether there were sexual

19

overtones or not, that doesn't decide the case, but

20

nonetheless, if you think that this individual male was

21

being discriminated against because he was a man and not

22

for some other reason, you can find for the plaintiff?

23

MR. REASONER:

It leads to that conclusion, Your

24

Honor, if you conclude that, looking at the language of

title VII in context, that Congress intended to limit it

to discrimination between men and women, that it did not

intend to reach into same-sex harassment, and -QUESTION:

3

Wait, you've acknowledged that it

didn't intend to limit it between men and women.

acknowledged that if you -- that if a woman discriminates

6

against another woman because of her womanness, say, I

just want a male workforce, I'm not going to promote any

8

women, you've acknowledged that that's a violation.

Certainly.

Certainly.

It's only in the sexual harassment

area --

MR. REASONER:

-- you think that it does not

15

to say it does not ever constitute a violation?

MR. REASONER:

Okay.

-- the Fifth Circuit said that.

But -- but let me say, I do

22

believe that is correct.

I think it implicates serious

concerns of federalism to now say that this statute will

be expanded to uncover this entire spectrum of

Once you've cut loose from the moorings of the

QUESTION:

Of course, there's another way of

looking at it.

8

and you're asking to cut out of the general field of

discrimination this one area.

10

Instead of saying it's expanding the

One can look at it that

way, too.
MR. REASONER:

11

One could, Your Honor, but I

12

submit, and even the Government admits this at page 10 of

13

their brief, that sexual harassment was an expansion of

14

the statute based on the intent of the statute, and I

15

think necessary to achieve the statutory purposes, and the

16

question before the Court now is, does sexual harassment

17

need to be applied in the context of single-sex

18

relationships in order to achieve the statutory purposes,

19

and - -

20

QUESTION:

But it's not necessary to look at it

21

as an expansion of the statute.

It seems to me that it's

22

sufficient to look at the sexual harassment law as being

23

in effect a kind of evidentiary gloss on the statute, that

24

when this kind of conduct occurs, as Thoreau put it, you

25

know, there's a trout in the milk.

means, and I don't see why we don't also draw an inference

2

when the harassment is between the same sexes.

3

It may in some instances be more difficult to

4

draw it, but as Justice Scalia says, what is the

5

theoretical basis for saying you can never draw that kind

of an inference?

MR. REASONER:

Well, you know, first I would say

that there -- the statute is solid.

It does not create

I can

1

understand your point there, but how do you take the final

2

leap, you can't draw it?

3

MR. REASONER:

But I would say, Your Honor, that

because of sex becomes contentless in this statute if

you're going to say every time there's sexual content,

male-on-male abuse, it's sexual harassment.
