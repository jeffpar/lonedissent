ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH N. FLAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FLAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The petitioner was arrested because he was

12

operating a business without having first obtained a

13

license from the respondent.

14

its police officers to make a full custodial arrest of

15

petitioner.

Respondent's policy required

16

Although we challenge the mandatory nature of

17

respondent's policy, our primary contention is that the

18

Fourth Amendment does not permit a full custodial arrest

19

for a fine-only infraction on the same basis as in felony

20

cases.

21

That is -QUESTION:

Mr. Flaxman, what do you mean by full

22

custodial arrest?

23

fingerprinted, he wasn't put in a holding cell.

24
25

This man was not handcuffed, he wasn't

MR. FLAXMAN:

What I mean is what is what the

Court said in Gustafson v. Florida, that a full custodial

arrest is when you're taken into custody, when you can be

2

subjected to an inventory search, when the area around you

3

can be searched, when you're subject to up to 48 hours of

4

post-arrest processing.

5

In this case the arrest was not as severe as it

6

could have been, but I don't think the Court has ever

7

engaged in balancing the severity of an arrest.

8

is an arrest is an arrest.

9

distinctions between them.
QUESTION:

10

An arrest

The Court has never made

Well, if an arrest is an arrest is an

11

arrest, your proposition that the commonlaw traditionally

12

has not allowed arrests for misdemeanors is patently

13

false.

14

arrest of motorists.

We've had several cases up here involving the

15

MR. FLAXMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

I mean, arrest means to stop the

person.

18

MR. FLAXMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

In --

Well, in the most recent case --

Isn't that a seizure, when they stop

a car?
MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, that's temporary

22

questioning.

In Whren the Court was very careful, I

23

think, not to say that Mr. Whren was being arrested.

24

Court said Mr. Whren was being subject to a temporary stop

25

for questioning, and during that questioning evidence was

found.

2

QUESTION:

Well, in your case do you think --

3

QUESTION:

You appeal to the common law.

Do you

4

think the common law makes that distinction between a

5

seizure that is an arrest in the technical sense that

6

you're telling us and the seizure that is not an arrest in

7

that technical sense?
MR. FLAXMAN:

8

9

Yes.

I think the nightwalker

statutes, allowing detention of suspicious people, is the

10

detention for investigation that is -- survives today in

11

Terry v. Ohio, but the common law I think was very, very

12

clear that an arrest as the way of initiating a

13

prosecution was reserved for felony cases or for nonfelony

14

cases where there was breach of the peace committed in the

15

officer's presence.

16

QUESTION:

17

So you say the nightwalker statute

was not an exception, then, to the misdemeanor --

18

MR. FLAXMAN:

It was not an arrest provision.

19

It was a detention provision, an investigative stop

20

provision.

21

QUESTION:

Well, in your case, in the case we

22

have before us, suppose the police officer did what you

23

say he should do and told the man, now you're going to

24

have to come down and I'm going to give you a citation,

25

and the fellow said, I'm not interested, and started to

walk away.

Could the officer hold him long enough to fill

2

out the citation?

3

MR. FLAXMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

Oh, if -- yes.

If --

Well, then an arrest is an arrest is

an arrest.
MR. FLAXMAN:

6

Well, no.

If a person refuses to

7

accept a field citation, or flouts the officer's

8

authority, or continues to jaywalk, or continues to

9

litter, or continues to deface public property -QUESTION:

10

No.

The officer stays stop, I'm

11

going to write you out a citation, and then he fumbles

12

with his book and so forth.
MR. FLAXMAN:

13

Isn't that an arrest?

That's not an arrest.

He has --

14

that's a detention for giving him the citation, and in the

15

situation where the person refuses to cooperate with the

16

officer who's writing the citation, then the person

17

traditionally has been subject to arrest for not

18

cooperating with the officer.

19

QUESTION:

Of course, the Fourth Amendment

20

doesn't address arrest.

21

of them are seizures.
MR. FLAXMAN:

22

It addresses seizures, and both

Well, the Court has differentiated

23

between seizures which are arrests and seizures which are

24

temporary detentions for investigation like of luggage, or

QUESTION:

Like a what?

2

MR. FLAXMAN:

Like of luggage, or a stop of a

3

person for questioning at the scene of a motor vehicle

4

incident.

5

Getting back to Whren, the Court was not there

6

talking about a full custodial arrest.

7

talking about a detention, a stop to investigate, which is

8

not --

9

QUESTION:

The Court was

Well, you -- but I thought you

10

replied to Justice Ginsburg's question a few minutes ago

11

that the Court has never distinguished between kinds of

12

arrests, and now you're distinguishing between them.

13

MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, Whren was not an arrest, is

14

what our point is.

15

Whren was a detention for --

16

QUESTION:

Whren did not rise to that level.

Okay.

Well, what is the significance

17

of the term arrest in Fourth Amendment connotation?

18

Justice Scalia says, the Fourth Amendment doesn't talk

19

about arrest.

20

MR. FLAXMAN:

As

It talks about unreasonable

21

seizures of people.

When somebody is arrested they're

22

taken into custody.

They're subject to all of the

23

post-arrest processing that the Court has approved.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but how do you know that

they're subject to all the post-arrest processing.

How do

1

you know they're not simply subject to what they were in

2

fact subjected to?

3

MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, when somebody's taken to the

4

police station the Court has uniformly held that that's an

5

arrest situation.

6

In Berkemer, which was the motorist stop with

7

Miranda warnings, the Court said you're not entitled to

8

Miranda warnings when you've been stopped and we're

9

investigating, but once you're in custody, you are

10

entitled to Miranda warnings, which is what happened to

11

the petitioner in this case.

14

He wasn't just brought to
He was brought and locked in

Well, the distinction you're making

15

is the distinction between simply stopping and keeping

16

someone basically in the vicinity of the stop, and on the

17

other hand taking the person away, as to the police

18

station.

MR. FLAXMAN:

Is that where you draw the line?
That's correct, and we don't

have --

QUESTION:

Taking them into custody, I suppose.

22

MR. FLAXMAN:

QUESTION:

Well, I --

I suppose that you'd say if the

24

officer told the person, you are under arrest, you'd say

25

that that was an arrest even if -8

MR. FLAXMAN:

That's true, but once you're under

arrest you don't stay at the scene.

QUESTION:

You're taken away to

Suppose the door weren't locked.

5

Suppose the police said, we want a bond because the

6

liability here could run into several thousands,

7

considering how long you operated without a license, so

8

we're going to take you in because we have no facilities

9

to arrange for the bond in your workplace, and we'll put

10

you in a waiting room and we'll see where you are but we

•11

won't lock the door.

12

13
14

MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, if Mr. Ricci was free to

leave, then he would not have been under arrest.
But getting back to the bond question, the court

15

of appeals discovered that aspect of what they believed

16

the Village's policy was on their own.

17

never urged that Mr. Ricci was facing more than a

18

potential $500 fine.

19

The Village had

The officers who arrested Mr. Ricci knew that

20

what was going to happen was that he would get a business

21

license and, in fact, we know that the license was secured

22

while he was under arrest and in custody.

23

He wasn't facing this gigantic fine.

He was

24

facing the annoyance and the humiliation of being

25

arrested, but he wasn't facing -- there wasn't the

1

realistic expectation that he was facing a fine.

2

In those situations where there is a realistic

3

expectation that someone is facing a huge fine and might

4

not come to court, the officer should get a warrant.

5

That's a tradition -QUESTION:

6

If in this case the officer had

7

gotten a warrant, then everything would have been fine.

8

Is that --

9

MR. FLAXMAN:

10

municipality's policy.

11

don't know how it could be raised, about whether a judge

12

has the authority to issue a warrant, but I think

13

traditionally and at common law judges could issue

14

warrants for minor offenses.

15

QUESTION:

We would not be challenging the
There would be a question -- I

We have that in the --

Is there a question about whether the

16

police officer in a case like this, an infraction of an

17

ordinance, could have gotten a warrant?

18

MR. FLAXMAN:

There's no question there are

19

Illinois cases approving the obtaining of warrants to make

20

arrests for minor offenses, and -QUESTION:

21

So it's not the idea that this is

22

such a minor thing that somebody shouldn't be in custody.

23

You say he could be in custody as long as there's a

24

warrant.

MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, but in order to get a

warrant in Illinois the officer, whoever applied for a

2

warrant has to make a showing not only that there's a

3

violation of the law but that the person will not obey a

4

summons, or will not obey a citation.

5

likelihood that the person will flee unless they're

6

arrested.

7

There's some

And that's absolutely not present in this case,

8

where the officers knew for 2 days that Mr. Ricci was

9

operating his business and that he appeared not to have a

10

license.
QUESTION:

11

Well, what if Illinois law were

12

otherwise and a warrant was obtainable on precisely the

13

showing that the police had here.

14

that would violate the Fourth Amendment?
MR. FLAXMAN:

15

No.

Would -- do you think

I think that would be

16

consistent with the common law history of specific

17

warrants for specific offenses, even for minor offenses.

18

QUESTION:

But it doesn't make sense to say -- I

19

thought your objection was that there was no good reason

20

for taking this person down to the station.
Now you're telling us it doesn't matter if

21
22

there's any good reason, so long as you get a warrant, and

23

a warrant doesn't -- you don't need a good reason to get a

24

warrant.

1

2

QUESTION:

I would have thought your position

would be, you need a good reason to get a warrant, too.

3

MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, I think a judge looking at a

4

warrant application in this case would say, why do you

5

want to arrest this man, give him -- issue a summons.

6

7

QUESTION:

He doesn't have to say that.

You

just told the Chief Justice he doesn't have to say that.

8

MR. FLAXMAN:

9

but I think that --

10

QUESTION:

Oh, he doesn't have to say that,

So you're willing -- so long as a

11

warrant issues, it doesn't matter what the conditions for

12

the warrant are.

13

MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, I think the Court has

14

traditionally respected the warrant as legitimizing a

15

seizure.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Oh, we've also traditionally required

a probable cause for a warrant to be a proper warrant.
MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, there's no disagreement in

19

this case that there was probable cause to believe that

20

Mr. Ricci did not have a business license.

21

is whether the officers without a warrant --

22

QUESTION:

The question

Yes, but it was probable cause of an

23

arrestable offense, is the probable cause that we'd

24

normally have.

25

MR. FLAXMAN:

That's exactly the position that

1

we're advocating here, but that is not what the court of

2

appeals said, and that's not what some of the State courts

3

have said, that if there's any kind of violation then

4

police officers without a warrant can go and arrest

5

someone for littering.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. FLAXMAN:

8

9

What about -- what's a misdemeanor?
A misdemeanor is an offense

punishable by incarceration.
QUESTION:

It's not in Massachusetts.

10

Massachusetts defines misdemeanor in terms -- and felony

11

in terms of where you can be incarcerated.

12

incarcerated in State prison, then it's a felony.

13

not incarcerated in a State prison, it's not a felony.

14

If you're
If it's

I've never been able to figure out -- you'd have

15

to go through the statute books, decide where you have to

16

go to Concord, where you'd have to go to Walpole, where

17

you could be imprisoned in a different place.

18
19
20
21
22

I mean, my point is every State has a different
definition.
MR. FLAXMAN:

Every State has a different

definition of -QUESTION:

And Massachusetts is really

23

complicated, so I just realized you can't tell me what it

24

is in Massachusetts.

25

MR. FLAXMAN:

You don't know.
I think it's clear -- it's easy to

1

look at the statutes in any State and determine what's a

2

fine-only infraction.

3

QUESTION:

Oh, it is?

In Massachusetts -- I'll

4

read you the statute.

5

said it says.

6

by imprisonment in the State prison is a felony.

7

other crimes are misdemeanors.

10

It says -- I mean -- it says what I

It says a felony is -- a crime punishable

MR. FLAXMAN:

only infraction is a crime or if it's a civil infraction.
QUESTION:

12

a civil infraction?

Do you take the position that this is

13

MR. FLAXMAN:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FLAXMAN:

17

But then the question which has

been addressed in a number of courts is whether a fine-

11

16

All

Absolutely.

It --

What's a civil infraction?
It's something that's punishable

by fine only, which is not even the level of -QUESTION:

All right.

So in other words now --

18

because that's easier.

19

is, since -- I mean, one of the terrible problems is you

20

have 50 States and each has a different definition of

21

misdemeanor and felony, so I didn't know where your rule

22

applies, where it doesn't apply.

23

In other words, what you're saying

Now, you say we look to the statute books and we

24

say, you see, if it's punishable by fine only you can't

25

arrest a person even if he's committing the crime, and if

1

it's not punishable by fine only you can.
MR. FLAXMAN:

2

3

Unless the infraction is --

involves a breach of the peace, or there's some emergency.

4

QUESTION:

Yes, okay.

Then I guess a lot of

5

things -- you know, careless driving, reckless driving,

6

false information to a police officer, a fish and game

7

violation -- I bet we went through a lot of those, you

8

know, minor things, I bet we'd find in a lot of States

9

that it's not just fine only, or maybe you've done it, and

10

maybe you know.
MR. FLAXMAN:

11
12

rule doesn't apply.

13

QUESTION:

If it's not fine only then our

All right.

Well then, are we really

14

going to separate the -- what you're trying to do is get

15

the really trivial things from the more important ones,

16

and will a fine-only rule do it?

17

MR. FLAXMAN:

Oh, I think it will do it.

I

18

think things that are fine only are really, really

19

trivial.

20

Court has done that with the right to trial by jury with

21

petty offenses.

22

23

I think if we look at -- the -- I mean, the

QUESTION:

Even fine-only offenses, you say, if

they involve a breach of the peace are arrestable.

24

MR. FLAXMAN:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That comes from the -- the breach of

the peace term comes from the common law?

mean at common law?

3

MR. FLAXMAN:

And what did it

It meant a disturbance to public

4

order, that there was some -- some need to -- that the

5

arrest was necessary to preserve order.
QUESTION:

6

7

Oh, I think it doesn't mean that.

think it meant any violation of the law.

MR. FLAXMAN:

QUESTION:

In --

That was --

10

MR. FLAXMAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

I

It mean --

Any violation of the King's -- any

violation of the law was a violation of the King's peace.
MR. FLAXMAN:

13

It meant that in a different

14

context.

15

in the common law cases, a breach of the peace meant an

16

affray, that that there was a disorder, an actual disorder

17

or a potential for a future disorder.

18

As it was consistently applied to arrest cases

QUESTION:

Well, does it add anything to your

19

position to say that one can arrest in a fine-only case if

20

there is also a breach of the peace, because if there's a

21

breach of the peace in the modern sense, that would be a

22

separate offense in virtually all States, I assume, and it

23

would be committed in the officer's presence and so this

MR. FLAXMAN:

10

Well, I think it's hypothetically

11

possible to envision, and maybe my opponent can, a

12

fine-only ordinance which involves a breach of the peace

13

for which the officer should be able to arrest where there

14

is no misdemeanor or felony but it involves the same

Mr. Flaxman, I guess it's clear that

the line-drawing is not going to be simple, assuming we

that is going to be served by drawing this line and

What, as you understand it, is the value

If there is no line drawn and

police officers are free to make arrests for any violation

9

that they observe, then we have gone back, I believe, to

10
11

giving general warrants to police officers.
QUESTION:

Why are we giving general warrants?

12

They've simply -- they've got to justify the arrest by

13

virtue of an offense and probable cause to believe the

14

offense was -- had been committed.

MR. FLAXMAN:

That's the --

The general warrant would

2

where probable cause is nonetheless required.

3

It gets us into a no-warrant situation

also involved the officers having some belief that

somebody was involved with the wrongdoing, the subject of

the warrant.

QUESTION:

Well, sometimes when they had a

general warrant, they could arrest without probable cause,
the general warrant was abused.

But we're not talking

10

about that situation.

which there's no warrant but there is a probable cause

We're talking about a situation in

Well, I disagree that a fine-only

18

value of limiting the ability of the police to make

1

arrests for fine-only infractions that do not involve a

20

breach of the peace is that it promotes respect for the

law, and it avoids the situations where police are using

In a sense, Justice Kennedy, the

MR. STRAUSS:

1

Justice Ginsburg, for purposes of

2

the Fourth Amendment I think the choice about whether to

3

proceed by citation, which I agree is often allowed by

4

municipalities, or whether to proceed in this way I think

5

has to be left to local circumstances.
We happen to be in a position where we can

6

7

process people quickly and where, for whatever reason, we

8

want these decisions not to be made by officers on the

9

beat, whether it's because we think they'll be vulnerable

10

to accusations of shakedowns and intimidation, or because

11

we want them back out on the street and not processing

12

applications, or for whatever reason, and we can process

13

them quickly.

14

In a large metropolitan area, where there are

many, many arrests, the policy is likely to be a different

one.

12

1

MR. STRAUSS:

The -- my -- the basis for my

2

position is that the Fourth Amendment cannot be read to

3

draw a sharp line between criminal and civil arrests, and

4

the authority for that is the Court's statement, Justice

5

Brandeis' statement in Long v. Ansell that civil arrests

6

were common at the time of the framing, and the inclusion

7

in the Constitution of an immunity that applies only to

8

civil arrests, confirming that, in fact, civil arrests are

9

contemplated by the Constitution.

10

QUESTION:

Yes, but if you're going to appeal

11

the history, I think you've got the problem that was

12

raised earlier.

13

could be arrests for civil offenses, but I think there is

14

not undoubted history, and I think there is not any

15

history that there could be arrests for civil or -- for

16

civil offenses without some written arrest warrant,

17

whether you call it capias or some other term, and that's

18

the issue here, not whether you can arrest or not.

Justice Scalia, so far as I

No, but even if there's no common law

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Justice Breyer, you asked for examples of

14

criminal fine-only offenses, and we list a number of these

15

on page 20 of our brief which are, of course, Federal

16

ones, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.

17

This is not an exhaustive list, but they include

18

such things as exclusion of jurors on account of race,

19

interference with aids to navigation, vandalism at

20

national monuments and military parks, and as I said, this

21

is the tip of the icebergs.

22

Our initial cut at how many Federal fine-only

23

criminal offenses there are was around -- I think I got

24

around 60 to 70, and I don't know if that's exhaustive.
