CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 120 Original, New Jersey v. New York.

Mr. Yannotti.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. YANNOTTI

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. YANNOTTI:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In his final report the Special Master concluded

10
11

that New York's jurisdiction on Ellis Island was limited

12

to the island as it existed in April 1834, and New Jersey

13

is sovereign over the portions of the island created by

14

artificial filling of submerged lands in the years after

15

1834 .

16

Although we take issue with the amount of

17

territory allocated to New York and with the recommended

18

boundary line of the Special Master, we would first like

19

to offer the Court our reasons why we believe the Special

20

Master's principal conclusion is legally sound and amply

21

supported by the record.

22

First, the Special Master correctly interpreted

23

the 1834 Compact between the States which fixed the

24

territorial limits and jurisdiction of New Jersey and New

25

York along their common boundary.

1

My only observation about that, and

2

it helps your case, I think, I was a little puzzled that

the Special Master did not pay more of a -- put more

weight on the Holmes' opinion in Central -MR. YANNOTTI:

Well, we certainly did place a

great deal of weight on the Holmes' opinion and we do

10

The Special Master didn't seem to

think -- it seems to me it -- on the sovereignty issue
that if New York is right we have to overrule that.
MR. YANNOTTI:

11

Well, they certainly did make

12

that argument below before the Special Master.

13

the amici have made that point.

14

attack on the Holmes' opinion or request to see it

15

overruled in the Exceptions, so I'm not sure that's an

16

issue --

QUESTION:

Some of

I did not see a direct

We would have to overrule it were New

York to have sovereignty, would we not?
MR. YANNOTTI:

Yes, I think so, Your Honor.

I

20

think that case squarely decides the question of

21

sovereignty over the submerged lands.

22

rejected in that case was an argument that all New Jersey

23

had under the Compact was a right of property under these

24

submerged lands.

1

jurisdiction that remains, Holmes' opinion is not quite

2

clear, and I think that probably needs further

3

elaboration.

4

MR. YANNOTTI:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. YANNOTTI:

7

QUESTION:

Under Article III?

Yes.
Yes, well --

Well, or whether there is a

8

difference in Article III jurisdiction or Article II

9

jurisdiction is not clear from Central Railroad.
MR. YANNOTTI:

10

Well, Justice -- Justice Holmes

11

indicated in the Central Railroad case that under Article

12

II, New York had retained its present jurisdiction of and

13

over Ellis Island, which he interpreted to mean was the

14

States intended to preserve the status quo ante, and the

15

status quo that existed in 1834 was a situation where

16

Ellis Island was on the New Jersey side of the boundary,

17

it was a 2-3/4 acres of fast land to mean high water, it

18

was owned by the Federal Government, who had acquired it

19

in 1808 from the State of New York, and it was utilized as

20

a military fort.

21

New York, in fact, had ceded jurisdiction to the

22

Federal Government in those conveyances, and retained only

23

the right to serve civil and criminal process, so that was

24

the jurisdiction that was retained by the State of New

25

York.

That was the -- what we contend was the present

1

jurisdiction in 1834 when the agreement was made, and

2

moreover, our view is that the States recognized that the

3

island then in existence which was, as I said, 2-3/4

4

acres, was the Ellis Island that was being addressed by

5

the terms of that Compact, so I do --

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Yannotti, at least as to the land

7

that was once submerged and has now been filled in, there

8

was a significant argument made that Holmes was wrong, at

9

least to the extent that he defined exclusive rights of

10
11

property to mean sovereignty.
MR. YANNOTTI:

Well, I respectfully argue that

12

Holmes was not wrong, and that he reached the correct

13

conclusion.

14

the -- for a unanimous Court was to base his judgment upon

15

the prior decision of the New York Court of Appeals of

16

1870, which had concluded essentially that the territorial

17

line was the principal and dominant purpose of this

18

agreement, that the State of New Jersey was sovereign on

19

its side of the boundaries --

20

QUESTION:

21

In fact, what he did in that opinion for

Well, that part I understand, the

equation of boundary with sovereignty.

22

MR. YANNOTTI:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Yes.

But Holmes also said something about

exclusive right of property.
MR. YANNOTTI:

Yes.

1

QUESTION:

And you know the three-way division

2

that was offered in some of the briefs, of the property

3

right and the public access right and the governing right.

4

MR. YANNOTTI:

The argument was made that all

5

New Jersey had was the sovereign right of property, and he

6

found that that actually supported the notion that New

7

Jersey was sovereign in this territory, and he said that

8

the ownership of submerged land was indicative of the

9

division of sovereign territory and actually furthered and

10

supported the notion that this was a line not only of

11

territory but of jurisdiction and sovereignty, so I think

12

the -- what Justice Holmes said --

13

QUESTION:

So property means jurisdiction and

14

exclusive jurisdiction doesn't mean exclusive

15

jurisdiction.

16

MR. YANNOTTI:

17

QUESTION:

Well --

Is -- would there have been a clearer

18

way to say that one of the States had governing

19

authority --

20

MR. YANNOTTI:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

Well, I think it --

-- than to use the phrase, exclusive

jurisdiction?
MR. YANNOTTI:

The -- I think it's important to

24

focus also, not only on that but also on the notion

25

exclusive jurisdiction over the waters, and I think that

1

is the key element of that Article III, because New Jersey

2

had recognized that New York had exclusive jurisdiction,

3

but it was limited.

4

authority.

5

that's how the New York Court of Appeals interpreted

6

Article III in 1870, to mean --

7
8

9
10

It wasn't full sovereign governmental

It was limited to control of the waters, and

QUESTION:

Well, it was control of the waters.

It also referred to the submerged lands.
MR. YANNOTTI:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And isn't there a fair argument to be

11

made that when the submerged lands become in effect the

12

basis for filled land, in place of what had been water

13

subject to New York's jurisdiction, that that same

14

territory now newly created above the ground becomes

15

subject to the same exclusive jurisdiction?

16

MR. YANNOTTI:

Well, our argument is that that

17

is not the case, and we rely in that regard upon, again,

18

that 1870 decision of the New York Court of Appeals, which

19

said that although there was in Article III a reference to

20

jurisdiction over the submerged lands, that was merely

21

subordinate to and in furtherance of the power over the

22

waters, and it was -- the New York Court of Appeals gave

23

it a very limited reading in that case, and in fact in the

24

1908 decision by Justice Holmes the Court specifically

25

upheld the taxation of submerged lands -8

1

Yes, but how could it have no

2

meaning?

That is, let's assume you're right.

3

right that -- I'm assuming -- that this is within the

4

sovereign -- your sovereign -- New Jersey has sovereignty.

5

MR. YANNOTTI:

6

QUESTION:

7

You're

Yes.

Because of Article I.

Still, isn't

there some kind of jurisdiction to do something --

8

MR. YANNOTTI:

9

QUESTION:

Our view of --

-- given by Article III, and is --

10

you want an injunction, which injunction says New York can

11

do nothing.

12

MR. YANNOTTI:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

All right.

How can it be that they

14

could do nothing when Article III says they have

15

jurisdiction over the land below the water and the water?

16

I mean, maybe that jurisdiction doesn't mean sovereignty.

17

Maybe it only means a few things, like just serve process

18

even, but doesn't it mean something?

19

MR. YANNOTTI:

Well, again I think the -- we go

20

back to the decision of the New York Court of Appeals in

21

1870, and what the court said was that this was a

22

jurisdiction over navigation.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. YANNOTTI:

25

All right, so -And once the waters were filled

there was no basis upon which to exercise jurisdiction

1

over ships and vessels on the water, that the jurisdiction

2

essentially -- there was no basis upon which to exercise

3

that jurisdiction when the land was filled.

4

QUESTION:

In other words, exclusive

5

jurisdiction doesn't mean that.

6

thing you could deal with is a ship, so that it --

7

MR. YANNOTTI:

It means that the only

It does mean exclusive related to

8

ships, related to navigation.

9

QUESTION:

So suppose there is a ship, a ferry

10

boat tied up at the pier that now is in New Jersey's

11

sovereign territory next to that immigration house, all

12

right.

13

Doesn't New York have jurisdiction over that?
MR. YANNOTTI:

That's specifically addressed in

14

Article III, where New York's jurisdiction is recognized,

15

at least to the extent --

16

QUESTION:

Fine.

If New York has jurisdiction

17

over that, on your theory, how can you receive an

18

injunction, which is what you requested, saying that they

19

couldn't enforce their law at all?

20

MR. YANNOTTI:

Well, I think -- again, my point

21

is that this is a jurisdiction as it relates to vessels,

22

and if they're tied to a port facility on the New Jersey

23

side that creates an entirely different situation than to

24

have filled land, because they cannot --

25

QUESTION:

So what sort of injunction -- this is

1

what's confusing me.

The injunction that you requested is

2

an injunction that says New York cannot enforce its laws

3

or assert its jurisdiction.

4

is something at least they could do, even if it's just to

5

a boat that's tied up, then how could you be entitled to

6

that injunction?
MR. YANNOTTI:

7

Then once you say that there

That is not -- again, the request

8

that we sought relates to exercise of jurisdiction on the

9

land.

Not on the waters, not on boats who are still on

10

the waters that may very well be tied up on -- to a New

11

Jersey pier, or to a portion of land that is subject to

12

the jurisdiction of the State of New Jersey.

13

QUESTION:

And I didn't find in the Special

14

Master's report a discussion of what exclusive

15

jurisdiction meant.

16

believes that New Jersey is sovereign, and I accept that,

17

so what are we to do to decide whether exclusive

18

jurisdiction means you can do zero, New York can still do

19

zero in respect to the submerged land?

I understood that he gives --he

MR. YANNOTTI:

Well, again it relates to the --

courts, that jurisdiction relates to -- the subject matter

1

waters, and that is the -- that is the limit there of the

2

jurisdiction.

3

QUESTION:

Well, the master touched that in part

4

at page 67, when he said interpreting exclusive

5

jurisdiction in Article Third to mean police or legal

6

jurisdiction as the only reading of Article III that

7

prevents such serious anomalies, but he -- and he -- but

8

he addressed it no further than that.

9

MR. YANNOTTI:

Right.

Is that --

Well, I think this

10

specific argument that's now being offered with regard to

11

the -- some residuum of Article III jurisdiction over the

12

filled lands is not an issue that was really raised very

13

much by the State of New York.

14

the context of the Exceptions, so the master did not

16

the Special Master.

17

QUESTION:

It's only come in now in

Mr. Yannotti, I'm a little curious as

18

to why New Jersey did not make the argument which seems to

19

me available that the Compact only gives New York

20

exclusive jurisdiction over lands covered by the Hudson,

21

and these lands are not any more covered by the Hudson.

22

If you read that phrase as meaning covered from time to

Essentially what we have been

But I think the point is that once they are

It is

10

I did not understand you as having

MR. YANNOTTI:

Well, that has been our point,

11

and I do believe we have that in our brief, but it is our

12

argument that once the lands were filled, that there is no

13

basis upon which New York may exercise that jurisdiction

14

under Article III.

15

And let me add further with regard to these,

16

what we perceive to be sound interpretations of the

17

Compact that were reached by the New York court in 1870,

18

and also by the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals,

19

our highest court, these rulings, which were the basis

20

upon Justice Holmes' decision in 1908 have been accepted

21

by both States, and they have -- they have become over

22

time the -- a meeting of the minds between these two

23

States as to the meaning of this particular compact, and

24

we think for that reason, too, the Court should reaffirm

25

what Justice Holmes said in his -- in the 1908 decision

and apply that principle to the submerged lands here once

2

they are filled.

Let me --

QUESTION:

One point on jurisdiction.

Is it

5

your point that Article III exclusive jurisdiction is of

somewhat lower order than the word present jurisdiction in

7

Article II?

MR. YANNOTTI:

Well, in order to determine the

present juris -QUESTION:

Because if so that's a strange use of

words, as Justice Scalia pointed out.

12

jurisdiction seems to me broader.

13

MR. YANNOTTI:

Exclusive

Well, present jurisdiction,

14

really in order to ascertain precisely the meaning of that

15

you have to go back to the situation as it existed in 1834

16

to determine what was the jurisdiction, and at that time

17

New York had virtually no jurisdiction.

18

everything to the Federal Government, and the island had

19

been used in those days as a military fort for the

20

exclusive purposes of the Federal Government.

21

Federal enclave, and New York had no presence there, and

22

New York exercised no jurisdiction there, and so therefore

23

that is the present jurisdiction.

24
25

They had ceded

It was a

And if you perceive that to be a lower, some
lesser element of jurisdiction, it certainly is supported

1

by the factual record, which shows that this was a Federal

2

enclave subject to Federal jurisdiction.

3

MR. YANNOTTI:

The Special Master also

4

determined that New York had failed to establish its

5

affirmative defense of prescription and acquiescence, and

6

on this point, too, we think that the Special Master's

7

analysis was correct.

8

9

We urge the Court to accept it.

Again, as I mentioned, this was an island that
was under the Federal Government's exclusive control.

10

This was true prior to the filling in 1890, which

11

commenced in 1890, and it was certainly true right on

12

through the period, the immigration period which New York

13

focuses on so strenuously.

14

for either State to exercise jurisdiction in the Federal

15

enclave, and our view is that that being the case, New

16

York could not establish the requisite degree of

17

government dominion and control in order to place New

18

Jersey on notice that it was prescribing jurisdiction over

19

this territory.

There was little opportunity

20

What is more, New Jersey did not acquiesce in

21

the purported assertion of jurisdiction by the State of

22

New York, and as the record amply demonstrates, there were

23

extensive instances where New Jersey either took

24

prescriptive acts, or asserted claims to the territory

25

which were sufficient enough to establish New Jersey's

1

assertion that there was nonacquiescence in New York's

2

claims, so on this point, too, we think the Special Master

3

was correct.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Yannotti, are you going to talk

5

about the recommendation of the master that the actual

6

territorial boundary he proposes be adjusted to take care

7

of certain buildings and improvements?
MR. YANNOTTI:

8

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

I

9

think -- I understand from the Chief Deputy Clerk that the

10

Court does have the map in front of it today, and that map

11

illustrates, as does Appendix K in the Special Master's

12

report, it illustrates this proposed boundary to which

13

we've taken exception.
As you can see on that map, the original island

14
15

to the mean high water is indicated there, and that is not

16

the line of demarcation that has been recommended to the

Court by the Special Master.

contends is the line which should be employed.

The Court has said that when the States make a

4

boundary agreement, and when such an agreement is approved

5

by Congress, that the -- an agreement of that sort is a

6

law, a Federal law, and the Court is without authority to

7

depart from the terms of that agreement, and regrettably

8

that is what the Special Master has recommended here.
We think that that is not an appropriate

10

exercise of the Court's power in this regard, that the

11

Court should abide by the boundary that was agreed to by

12

the States.

to that in its implementation, that remains to the States,

with the oversight of Congress, to make whatever

adjustments might be deemed appropriate.

QUESTION:

4

Well, isn't it also because we're

bound by an act of Congress?
MR. YANNOTTI:

Yes, they said that.

What the

5

Court said in Texas v. New Mexico was that once an act of

6

Congress, an agreement like this which is approved by

7

Congress, it becomes a Federal law, and the Court cannot

8

enter relief that is inconsistent with the terms of that

9

law, and for that reason we think that the Court is

10

limited in providing relief in this case to the boundary

11

that was agreed by the States, and cannot employ practical

12

considerations to write or create a boundary, what the

13

Court may perceive to be a better boundary.

14

That judgment's already been made by the States,

15

and recognized by Congress, and we think it ought to be

16

respected by the Court.

I'm still fuzzy about it -- what authority New York --

It relates also to navigation.

For example, the case of State v. Babcock, which was an

happened in that case was there were vessels which were

sunk onto the underwater land, and the -- an action was

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

12

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. MINEAR:

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The master correctly rejected New York's

15
16

contention that Article Second of the Compact of 1834

17

gives New York sovereignty over the filled areas of Ellis

18

Island.

19

common law rules respecting coastal boundaries, and those

20

rules recognized that avulsive changes such as the

21

addition of fill did not change the location of the

22

boundary.

23

not purport to alter the common law rules.

24

the Compact should be interpreted as following the common

25

law and therefore granting and preserving New Jersey's

The Compact was written against a back-drop of

The Compact does not address fill, and it does

1

sovereignty over the filled areas.

2

Now, the master was also correct in rejecting

3

New York's contention that the filled portions of Ellis

4

Island became territory of New York through the doctrine

5

of prescription and acquiescence, and we think the single

6

most important consideration on this score is the fact

7

that the United States exercised dominant and virtually

8

exclusive jurisdiction over the island during the relevant

9

time period.

10

Now, the United States presence is important for

11

two reasons.

12

Jersey's claim to the filled lands by purchasing that area

13

from New Jersey and by indicating in subsequent maps that

14

it was situated in New Jersey.

15

First, the United States recognized New

Second, the United States' dominant sovereign

16

presence prevented New York from taking those acts of

17

sovereignty that would have established its claim of

18

entitlement to the filled areas, and likewise would have

19

put New Jersey on notice of the fact that New York was

20

making such a claim.

21

Now, New York also makes a claim that New Jersey

22

is guilty of laches in this case, but that really adds

23

nothing to New York's claim in this case at all.

24

Court indicated in Illinois v. Kentucky, the equitable

25

defense of laches is subsumed within the doctrine of

As this

prescription and acquiescence, so nothing is added by-

2

making those types of charges here.

3

Now, although we agree with the Master's

determination of the historic boundary on Ellis Island, we

disagree with his ultimate remedy, which would reconfigure

the boundary based on considerations of practicality and

convenience.

historic boundary line.

We think it's important to note at the

request, as well.

It did not request that the Court
Neither did New York make such a

But equally important, the master's proposal

would require this Court to exceed its historic role in

16

Do you think our position would be

altered if they had asked us to redraw the boundary?
MR. MINEAR:

17

If they had, then I think you'd be

faced squarely with the question of whether you have that

power or not, and we think that --

QUESTION:

I agree with Justice -- what

4

difference does it make, Mr. Minear, at this point in the

5

litigation,

6

drawing of the boundary line because neither party ever

7

asked for it?

8

further -- some sort of an amendment to the complaint and

9

they could bring it up again.

10

if we were to say that we reject the master's

I mean, presumably there could be

MR. MINEAR:

Well, that might be the -- that

11

might be the case, but we think that ultimately the Court

12

lacks the power to draw that boundary in any event --

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Then it really doesn't make any

difference whether they asked for it or not.
MR. MINEAR:

Ultimately it does not, but we do

16

think it's significant that neither party asked for it,

17

and this Court does not often grant relief that neither

18

party requested.

19

Now,

in the past this Court has decided boundary

20

disputes based solely on its interpretation and

21

application of relevant law, and the Court explicitly

22

recognized that limitation in Washington v. Oregon, where

23

Washington had asked this Court to change a boundary based

24

on changed circumstances, and this Court refused to do so.

25

It refused to do so even though the adjustment would

1

implement an underlying policy that Congress might have

2

preferred.

3

As that case indicates, once this Court

4

determines the location of a boundary, its judicial role

5

is at an end.
QUESTION:

6

But that case involved a variable

7

boundary, a boundary that could be here today and some

8

place else tomorrow, as opposed to what the Special Master

9

has done here.

10

He has fixed or recommended fixing a

boundary that would not be variable.
MR. MINEAR:

11

That's correct, but in this case

12

what we're saying is the historic boundary should be fixed

13

by the original contours of the island, because that's

14

what Congress and the parties intended by virtue of the

15

Compact of 1834.
QUESTION:

16

I'm just suggesting that there's a

17

little space between the Washington v. Oregon case and

18

this one.
MR. MINEAR:

19

That might be, but we think

20

ultimately the general principle at stake in Washington v.

21

Oregon does control here, which is that this Court should

22

respect the power of the political branches to determine

23

boundaries and draw those boundaries and, in fact, the

24

Constitution provides for adjustments of boundaries if

25

need be.

There is a Compact Clause of the Constitution

that does allow the States to agree, with Congress'

2

consent, to the alteration of the boundary, and that's in

is how that dispute was ultimately settled, was by virtue

That's correct.
Assuming that right, what do we do

no New York law at all can be enforced on the filled land?

MR. MINEAR:

I think -That's what was disturbing me because

17

of the concern that I had that exclusive jurisdiction

MR. MINEAR:

I think that takes us back to the

20

suggestion that the United States made at the point when

21

the complaint was first filed in this case and the Court

22

asked for our views on this matter, and at that point we

23

explained that there might be a number of issues that can

24

only be resolved in a specific factual context, and so

25

those issues are simply not ripe at this point.

that
QUESTION:

So what are we supposed to do, then,

about that?

MR. MINEAR:

We think all the Court can do at

this point, all the Court should do at this point is draw

7

simply indicate that any other dispute that might arise

8

can be handled by the parties seeking further relief, as

9

the Court has decreed.
QUESTION:

10

So we should not -- I think the

master, but I'm not certain, recommended that we accept

that paragraph 4, but we should not, in your opinion, do

that.

MR. MINEAR:

As a I'm not sure about -My recollection might be -- might

proposed decree does leave it open to the parties to seek

further relief at the foot of the decree, which is common

21

in the case of original actions and original decrees.

22

QUESTION:

I can't think of an original action

MR. MINEAR:

Usually that issue comes

That is correct, and that's -- this

5

case is unusual insofar as the United States owns title to

6

all of the land in question here.

7

QUESTION:

I understand, but you're saying we

8

don't have to decide that question now because the States

9

can come back later when there is more factual context to

it, and I'm not entirely sure they can come back later to

11

present us the question of which State has jurisdiction.

12

I --

13
14

MR. MINEAR:

Well, it's likely that the issue

could arise between a State and a private party.

QUESTION:

MR. MINEAR:

Right.

22

to have the power to regulate over a particular area, and

So Mr. Minear, in view of that, what

it's continuing, so the States want the boundary set, but

what consequence does that have as long as the United

7

MR. MINEAR:

I mean, you said the United

Oh, there are some modest

8

consequences with regard to certain activity, such as the

9

collection of tax revenues and the like.

Even if the

10

United States has exclusive jurisdiction over the entire

11

island, which is not something that we're asserting, but

12

even if it did, under the Buck Act the States can still

collect certain types of taxes from activities that take

place on the land.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MINEAR:

18

For example?
Sales taxes from concessions on the

island would be one example.
Both States would have no doubt claimed some

interest in the renovation of the southern portion of the

island here, but ultimately we think that Congress will

21

make those determinations, taking into account the

concerns and considerations of both States.

It doesn't, but in fact that's

2

can you say there's a boundary there if exclusive

3

jurisdiction in Article Third means what you say it does?

4

MR. SMIRLOCK:

Let me try to parse the first

5

three articles of the Compact for you, because I think

6

their structure proves our point.

7

Compact establishes the sovereign boundary between the

8

States as the midpoint of the bay, with, as it makes

9

clear, certain exceptions.

10

Article I of the

The first of those exceptions appears in

11

Article II, which gives the islands -- the islands which,

12

if they are on the western portion of the bay might under

13

Article First otherwise have fallen to New Jersey, gives

14

those islands without exception to New York.

QUESTION:

16

MR. SMIRLOCK:

18

Might -- would, under -Would, without Article Second,

but as it's agreed, Article Second gave them to New York.
Article Third deals with the waters, the

19

underwater land, and the New Jersey shoreline.

It gives

20

exclusive jurisdiction which, we argue, is in the nature

21

of police power, over navigation and commerce in the

22

harbor, and there's Compact history that supports this,

23

and the Special Master cites it, and so do we in our

24

brief, gives exclusive jurisdiction over both the lands

8

MR. SMIRLOCK:

Probably.

That sort of thing, and it refers

both to underwater land and to the waters in the harbor.
Now, New Jersey says that exclusive jurisdiction

10
11

is extinguished as soon as there is more land, there was

12

new land put in the harbor, but that seems most

13

improbable.

14

obviously entails jurisdiction over both the waters per se

and the lands in those waters, used as anchorage, used for

docking, used as storage areas, used for lighthouses, and

Well, New Jersey's -- as I understand

it, New Jersey's answer to that argument is that New York

of that is simply in effect a navigational commercial

extensively in use on both sides of the harbor.

16

It was about a -- 4/10ths of an acre of landfill, as

New Jersey, and Jersey City, and Hoboken, had

17

been extensively expanded by landfill, 750 acres of made

the Compact, the 4/10ths of an acre that I mentioned on

Ellis Island already.

for a barge to have gotten there at the time to supply the

QUESTION:

I see.

4

MR. SMIRLOCK:

-- who had authority over those

5

improvements, so when you see that in the Compact you have

6

to say either, they envisioned landfill on Staten Island

7

in New Jersey but not on islands where it had already been

8

put, which seems to us most improbable, or, they simply
didn't feel they had to deal with it because there was no

10

potential conflict between exclusive jurisdiction under

11

Article Third or Fifth and New York sovereignty over the

12

islands under Article Second.

13

If you think that New Jersey's right, you must

think -- you must think that the commissioners who made

the Compact actually thought that when that 5 feet of

landfill got added to the pier, that would be in New

notwithstanding having given them without exception or

qualification under Article Second to New York, and that

is a very improbable conclusion.

MR. SMIRLOCK:

6

I

Well, as a matter of fact, Ellis

7

Island, erroneously for New Jersey, was on both tax rolls

8

of the State, and in fact, although the tax records are so

9

old that we don't have them, in fact, at least as of 1940,

10

income tax earned by people who worked on the island would

11

have been taxable by a State.

13

which State was entitled to tax.

14

QUESTION:

It wasn't a completely

Well, that I grant you, but it seems

15

to me some of the examples that you give are things where

it really wouldn't have made any difference in the

2

QUESTION:

Or is it still prescription?

3

MR. SMIRLOCK:

No, it's not a laches argument in

4

disguise.

5

I'm not arguing at this moment that New Jersey should

6

have -- should have filed suit, though I will later on.

7

I think that's the separate laches argument.

But no, all I'm arguing is that the acts of New

8

York that I described, especially the legislative acts,

9

and the censuses, certainly were public acts as to which

10

New Jersey was on notice.
QUESTION:

11

But isn't it the overwhelming

12

presence of the United States throughout the period that

13

stops New Jersey -- what is there to object to?

14

governing power in fact is the United States, and the one

15

thing that is clear in this Compact is that Congress

16

reserved -- the hydra-headed word, jurisdiction, the

17

United States jurisdiction.

MR. SMIRLOCK:

The

As to that, Your Honor, as this

19

Court has often made clear, even when the United States

20

has plenary jurisdiction, enclave jurisdiction over

21

particular territory within a State, there's a good deal

22

of residual jurisdiction that can be exercised by that

23

State.

3

designed to preserve the good order of society, remain in

effect.

5

The municipal laws of

Federal law doesn't supplant them.
And then there are all the areas where, by

6

statute, State law applies.

The Assimilative Crimes Act,

7

the Davis-Bacon Act that I mentioned before, the Buck Act,

8

in all those areas, State law would still apply, so there

9

was plenty of play for New York jurisdiction, and our

10

point is that to the extent there was State jurisdiction

11

to be exercised, and there was plenty of room for it, it

12

was always New York that exercised it.

19

explained at trial, because the Federal Government wanted

20

to save some money, and New Jersey rates were lower, there

21

was a brief interregnum of about 2 years when New Jersey

1

Federal Government recognized its error, just as it had

2

many other times before, and said, oh, we made a mistake,

3

back to New York rates, and they started applying them

4

again.

5

It's hard to call that mixed.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I think all of that has less to

7

do with who they thought owned it than with whether the

8

rates are higher or lower and whether they're seeking

9

union support or not.

10

Don't you really think that's

what's driving all the Davis-Bacon stuff?
MR. SMIRLOCK:

11

Possibly with the Davis-Bacon

12

stuff it is, but with much of the -- I recited already the

13

examples of New York's prescription.
QUESTION:

15

How many people lived on Ellis

Island?
MR. SMIRLOCK:

16

Between 100 and 200 over the

17

years.

18

19

between 100 and 200, all of them on landfill, and they all

they could all have voted in New York.

1

that at no point, even though in 1904 Ellis Island had 12

2

acres of landfill on it, at no point did the United States

3

or New Jersey say, oh, and by the way, that 12 acres must

4

be in New Jersey.

5

The negotiations between those two parties

6

always dealt with the subaqueous land, and we think that

7

supports our view of the Compact, which is, if it was

8

underwater land, it was in New Jersey, but if it became

9

abovewater land by virtue of fill, it was Ellis Island,

10

and because under Article II of the Compact Ellis Island

11

goes to New York --

12

QUESTION:

Well, that really wasn't a very good

13

deal for New Jersey, certainly, if as soon as -- if they

14

owned the water -- owned the land when it was under water,

15

but as soon as it emerged from the water it went to New

16

York.
MR. SMIRLOCK:

17

Well, it was valuable land, Your

18

Honor.

They still had -- for one thing, they still had

19

the right of property in it.
QUESTION:

How much value is land that's under

water?
MR. SMIRLOCK:

because the States were building out landfill from both

2

sides, and they had to have some kind of plenary control

3

over navigation.

4

It was not a pittance.

5

That was very valuable land, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Mr. Smirlock, you know, I think it's

6

a hard row to hoe to establish prescription.

It really is

7

a very difficult thing.

8

your arguments as simply indicative of what the Compact

9

was understood to mean.

I guess I'm more sympathetic to

Just as in a normal contract interpretation one

10
11

can look at the parties' subsequent behavior after the

12

contract was signed, so also I'm sympathetic to the notion

13

that we can look to New York and New Jersey's subsequent

14

behavior as indication of what it meant.

MR. SMIRLOCK:

QUESTION:

MR. SMIRLOCK:

Right.

does show what the Compact meant.

8

MR. SMIRLOCK:

9

If that were all we have, maybe

not, but there is this pattern of everything that happened

10

on Ellis Island that was subject to any State's

11

jurisdiction or any sort of action by any State was always

12

taken control of by New York.

13

If all we had were a few birth certificates,

14

that would be problematic, but we have so much more, in
