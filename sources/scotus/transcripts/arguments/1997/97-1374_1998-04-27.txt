ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
GENERAL WAXMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Constitutional principles of separation of

11
12

powers govern both the standing and merits issues of the

13

case.

14

last term in Raines v. Byrd that the Article III inquiry

15

is especially rigorous when plaintiffs challenge the

16

allocation of constitutional power, yet here, in the New

17

York case, the State, which is not even a party, has not

18

been denied a single dollar in medicaid reimbursement and

19

the Secretary of HHS has not even determined that it

20

should.

21

With respect to standing, this Court recognized

In Snake River, the plaintiffs include no entity

22

whose taxes could possibly be affected by the challenged

23

cancellation and they have not shown that the cancellation

24

interfered with any transaction from which they likely

25

would have benefited.

3

On the merits, the President's cancellations
violated neither Article I nor the separation of powers.
The Presentment Clause was fully satisfied when

4

the President signed the Balanced Budget and Taxpayer

5

Relief Acts making them laws.

6

subsequently cancelled sections 4722(c) and 968, he was

7

not returning portions of the presented bills while

8

signing other portions into law.

9

limited discretionary authority to execute the law as it

10
11

When the President

He was implementing a

had been enacted by Congress.
Cancellations under the Line Item Veto Act do

12

not prevent Congress from making whatever laws it wants.

13

Congress could readily have exempted sections 4722(c) and

14

968 from the President's authority.

15

and, indeed, it identified section 968 in the Taxpayer

16

Relief Act as an item subject to cancellation.

17

QUESTION:

It chose not to do so

Is this more constitutionally

18

defensible than what we might call a pure line item veto

19

in which he --

20

GENERAL WAXMAN:

21

QUESTION:

It is.

In which he can veto the minute

22

that -- before the bill ever becomes law, and is the

23

reason for that because for a moment in time, at least,

24

there's a little law?

25

GENERAL WAXMAN:

No.

1

QUESTION:

Or a big law?

2

GENERAL WAXMAN:

No.

The critical reason is the

3

point I just identified, which is in a true line item

4

veto, which everybody understands is unconstitutional, the

5

Congress does not retain control to determine which

6

spending or tax items the President can't cancel.

7

If the President has the authority -- and this

8

is critical.

If the President has the authority to cancel

9

a provision before it becomes a law, under the Presentment

10

Clause he can cancel a designated tax or spending item and

11

then sign the law and Congress has thereby deprived itself

12

of the opportunity to create the law.
Here, the President signs the law and it becomes

13
14

a law under the Presentment Clause, and when he does so,

15

if the law contains a designated cancellable item,

16

Congress has made a law telling the President that,

17

subject to certain determinations and certain

18

considerations, and certain certifications, you have a

19

single, binary choice.
You can either spend the money as provided, or

20
21

you can spend it for deficit reduction by putting that

22

money into a lockbox, and in that manner the President is

23

executing the law that Congress has enacted, not vetoing

24

an item or repealing a provision that Congress has

25

enacted.

It's no different, I sus -- I suggest, for

1

2

Article I purposes, than if, instead of enacting the Line

3

Item Veto Act, Congress had simply decided to put in as

4

section 1 of every spending and taxing bill that it enacts

5

what is now section 961 of the Line Item Veto Act.

6

says, we have the following spending and taxing

7

provisions, but subject to these articulable principles

8

and these constraints, the President may decide, if he

9

signs this law, not to do certain things.
QUESTION:

10

It

Well, so far as the locked box is

11

concerned, this bill is the same as a line item veto.

12

mean, it's in a locked box that's going to contribute to

13

reducing the deficit.

14

the two.

15

I

So that's not a distinction between

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, I think the -- I think

16

it's -- the lockbox feature of this, which is the feature

17

that gives the President a single binary choice, tends to

18

make this much less of a delegation problem under

19

separation of powers than might otherwise exist, because

2C

in contradistinction to cases in which the Court has

21

upheld, for example, delegation of authority to the FCC or

22

the SEC to essentially create an entire code of conduct

23

for the securities industry, the Line Item Veto Act is

24

not -- and in this respect I think it's unique and

25

uniquely constrained.

It's not self-executing.

1

The President can't do anything with his

2

cancellation authority unless Congress subsequently passes

3

an act that has a cancellable item in it and does not

4

provide that the President's authority will not be subject

5

to cancellation.

6

8

9

It's almost the -- a mirror image of the
Impoundment Control Act.
QUESTION:

But that's -- that also sounds to me

the same as what we might call the pure line item veto.

10

GENERAL WAXMAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

Well, the --

A single, simple binary choice.

Sign

it or X it out.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

The problem -- the

14

constitutional deficiency in the line item veto, the -- a

15

pure, a true item veto, is that it violates the

16

Presentment Clause, which provides, among other things,

17

that the bill that the President signs making it a law has

18

to be the bill that each --a majority of each House of

19

Congress enacted, and if the President can excise a

20

provision before he signs the law, that's violated and, as

21

this Court has indicated --

22

QUESTION:

But Mr. Waxman, you wouldn't --

23

General Waxman, you wouldn't say that that's remedied if,

24

by the simple fact that it only applies to later laws

25

where Congress says he can do that.

2

I mean, I don't see how that argument carries
any water at all.

3

GENERAL WAXMAN:

4

QUESTION:

Well --

Your argument that, after all, he

5

cannot exercise this function on any legislation, but only

later legislation where Congress chooses to let him

exercise it.

9

You wouldn't say that that would make an

I -- if -- there are two bases

10

for a constitutional challenge to this authority.

11

under Article I and whether -- and asks the question

12

whether, in fact, the operation of this statute violates

13

the formal requirements of the Presentment Clause or, in

14

effect, effects a repeal.

15

One is

The other large issue is whether this represents

16

a violation of the separation of powers as applied to

17

Congress through the "non-delegation doctrine," and we --

18

QUESTION:

Right, but what I'm suggesting is, I

19

don't see how the fact that it only applies to later

20

legislation where Congress lets it apply has any bearing

21

upon either of those questions.

22

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, if it -- it has a bearing

23

on the Article I issue.

I don't think that the timing of

24

this relates to the scope or breadth of the delegation

25

except -- I take that back.

I think it relates to both.

What Congress --by making this bill -- this act

2

forward-looking, what it basically is saying, Congress has

3

reserved for itself the right, in every subsequent

4

spending or taxing bill that has a cancellable provision,

5

to decide, at the time that it passes those bills, whether

6

it will or will not allow the President to exercise that

7

authority.

Now -QUESTION:

That's fine, but once it decides that

it will, you have the same problem, that the -- I mean,

you may argue that it's no problem on other grounds, but I

11

don't see how it becomes --

12

GENERAL WAXMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Well --

--no problem simply because Congress

has said the President can do it.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

There are many historical

16

examples where Congress has given the President authority

17

to, if you will, repeal the effect of a prior enacted

18

statute, but --

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but not to repeal the statute,

and I mean, that's the difference.

21

GENERAL WAXMAN:

22

QUESTION:

Well --

The examples that you give are sort

23

of the kind of fact-finding examples in which, if the

24

President finds a given fact to be the case, then a

25

consequence follows and he must declare that consequence

and implement it, but that's not what we've got here.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

2

Well, I -- with all due

3

respect, Justice Souter, this is not a repeal of a

provision.

themselves, have got to follow the Presentment Clause.

There's no question --

Repeals of provisions of acts, or acts

QUESTION:

Well, but I mean, that's the -- you

say it's not, but that's one of the questions.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

10

I -- let me try and explain why

it
QUESTION:

11

Well, is the effect is -- in effect,

12

is it -- it says the law is no longer there.

13

no longer applicable.

14

but it's the same thing.

You can call it a different word,

GENERAL WAXMAN:

15

The law is

It's gone.
Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me

16

try and respond to these two questions in two ways.

17

of all, under the lockbox provisions of 6 1c, a cancelled

18

provision does retain real, legal budgetary effect.

1

removes the amount -- that amount of money under

20

Gramm-Rudman-Hoilings and the Budget Enforcement Act from

21

Congress' ability to spend that equivalent amount of

22

money.

23

First

It

Under the Budget Enforcement Act, ordinarily, if

24

a particular provision were vetoed, or not -- money were

25

not used by the President, Congress has the authority, up

1

to the budget baseline, to enact another provision and

2

spend that money.

3

A cancellation of a provision in this act

4

requires that that money be devoted to deficit reduction,

5

so first of all it is not true that it has no remaining

6

effect, but even --

QUESTION:

8

Congress' own internal rules.

Well, that's just an effect on

QUESTION:

11

GENERAL WAXMAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

GENERAL WAXMAN:

No.

Is it?
No.

Isn't it?
It is not.

The Budget

14

Enforcement Act as amending the Gramm-Rudman-Hoilings Act

15

of 1985 are statutes, laws that bind Congress and the

16

President.

17

They provide mandatory sequestration authority

18

in the President and in Congress in the event that the

19

baseline is exceeded, and what the lockbox provision of

20

the Line Item Veto Act does is to say, if this is not an

21

issue of whether the President wants to implement this

22

provision or not.

23

The President must implement this provision in

24

accordance with the law that Congress enacted, and that

25

means that you can either spend the money, give effect to

1

this provision to build a new dam in West Virginia, or

2

take the money that would have been spent for that and put

3

it in the deficit lockbox which, under the Budget

4

Enforcement Act, means that you cannot by -- enact a

5

compensating piece of legislation to otherwise spend the

6

money.

7

the President can spend.

8

9

It reduces the amount of money that Congress and

But even if it didn't have that effect, we think
that even without the lockbox provision this act would be

10

constitutional, because there are many examples, and I

11

respectfully submit that they are not all so easily

12

distinguishable, Justice Souter, of instances where

13

Congress has given one of the other two branches the

14

authority to take acts unilaterally that repeal not the

15

provision but the effect of the provision.

16

I mean, maybe the best example is the Rules

17

Enabling Act, which provides under 28 U.S.C. section

18

2072b, that the court may promulgate rules for the

19

district courts of procedure and evidence and that any --

20

and that those rules will "repeal prior inconsistent

statutes" -- I'm quoting from the Supreme Court's decision

example that is the closest you can come to the following,

2

that Congress passes a law that says next year Mr. Smith,

3

Mr. Jones, and 18 other people will not have to pay taxes

is there -- the standard being,

So he can choose to tax four people,

12

no people, as he wishes, without a standard but for the

13

national interest.

14

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

2

QUESTION:

That's exactly right.

I'm accepting

all your arguments up to that point, hypothetically.

3

GENERAL WAXMAN:

4

(Laughter.)

5

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I'll bank that.

The -- under the delegation

6

doctrine, the question always is, after -- well, at least

7

in this century, whether Congress has supplied an

8

intelligible principle or whether, as -- under the test

9

that this Court frequently announces,

it is

10

constitutionally significant if Congress clearly

11

delineates the general policy,

12

to implement the policy, and the boundaries of the

13

delegated authority.

14

Now,

the public agency that is

in your question you have posited an

15

example in which Congress has given the President no

16

intelligible principle other than the national interest.

17

I think that raises a much more difficult question than we

18

have here, because an argument could be made that the

19

President is constitutionally required to act in the

20

national interest, but the issue would be,

21

principle sufficiently intelligible.

22

Now,

is the

the best cases that we have for the

23

historical precedence for giving the President

discretionary authority to cancel limited tax cuts or

revenue-generating or nonrevenue-losing provisions would

be the cases that are recited in J. W. Hampton and in

2

Skinner, where the President was often authorized to

3

decide whether or not to collect duties or tariffs and

4

several of these temporary provisions were permanent, and

5

I think -- you know, it's --

6

QUESTION:

But those were based on factual

7

determinations that the President was entitled to make

8

under the statute, weren't they?

9

GENERAL WAXMAN:

They were, and the issue --

10

sometimes the determinations were specifically outlined,

11

as in Field v. Clark, where it was very specific, and

12

sometimes they were very, very general, and the issue then

13

is only whether the President has a sufficiently

14

intelligible principle.

15

You know, what's interesting about these old

16

cases, and there are many, many of them, is that these

17

were authorities that the President was exercising.

18

was discretion he was exercising at a time in our country

19

before we had an income tax and when in general the very

20

large portion of the Federal revenues were raised by

21

tariffs and custom duties.

22

QUESTION:

This

Well, in Justice Breyer's

hypothetical, you and he seemed readily to agree that we

can just look at this as a delegation problem.

it would.

I didn't mean to suggest that

I -- there are two different bases for

10

constitutional challenge.

11

Justice Breyer is whether or not there is a delegation of

12

authority that exceeds what Congress may do under the

13

Separation of Powers Clause.

14

One which I was discussing with

The other constellation of issues relate to

15

Article I, and I respectfully suggest that with respect to

16

these limited tax cuts the Article I problem is even less

17

than with respect to the other provisions, because this is

18

not an example of the President repealing a provision of

19

the law that Congress has enacted.

20

With respect to the limited tax cuts under

21

section 691f, the Joint Committee on Taxation is required

22

to go through and specify in the actual tax bill which

23

provisions of the bill are limited tax cuts subject to the

24

President's cancellation, so -- and that's exactly what

25

was done in this case in the Taxpayer Relief Act.

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, it -- what it

8

demonstrates, Chief Justice Rehnquist, is that what the

9

President is doing is not repealing a provision of a law

10

that Congress has enacted, but executing a discretionary

11

authority that Congress has given him.
Let me give you an example that was helpful to

12

13

me when I first started thinking about this problem.

14

Congress enacted a law -- and there is a very precise

15

historical precedence for this.

If

16

Congress passed a law that contained 10

17

different spending items, but they put a provision in that

18

basically said, in legalese, look, Mr. President, we think

19

all 10 of these projects are worthwhile, but we're very

20

concerned about the deficit, and we don't really think

21

that the country ought to be funding more than eight of

22

them.

23

of the 10 you want.

someone would suggest that.

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

If the -- if in your example the

factors that the Congress specified were straight fact as

opposed to normative factors, we'd be back in the old

7

cases that you and I referred to earlier, but if the

8

example is a normative example, as in the public interest,

then those cases are not authority, and you have, it seems

10

to me, a very different Article I problem.

That's easy.

But

Well, again, this Court in

Skinner stated that the standard for separation of powers

analysis with respect to tax provisions is no different

22

than it is with respect to spending provisions or any

other provision in the Constitution under Article I.

in the tax provision the Line Item Veto Act provides that

the Congress will specify for the President in the actual

It can't delegate the authority to make the

laws, and if it just passes a law that says, here are two

4

things we think are really nice, but we don't really have

5

the money to spend and you just pick whichever one you

6

want, I think the Court would appropriately say, look, the

Congress has delegated its law-making function because it

has not provided a "intelligible principle" by which the

In this case --

There isn't any.

is not our contention that a repeal of a law can be

effectuated by any means other than those specified in

GENERAL WAXMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, I --

That's what this case is.

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, first of all, the Line

11

Item Veto Act applies to three very, very specifically

12

defined provisions relating to spending and revenue that

13

account for a very small portion of the Federal budget

14

deficit, and it provides that before an item will be

15

cancellable it must satisfy each of three criteria, and

16

even if it does, the President must make three

17

different -- make certain determinations.

18

He must take into consideration a number of

19

factors that are specified, and he must identify for the

20

Congress a number of factors in his cancellation message.

21

QUESTION:

Well, General Waxman, you say it

applies only to a very small amount of spending, but if we

GENERAL WAXMAN:

1

I think there would be a

2

different question --we might be prepared to defend it,

3

but there would be a different question if the President

4

was given the authority to cancel existing items of direct

5

spending, which would be the equivalent of the repeal of

6

the effect of a prior law.

7

Here, we're only talking about new spending,

8

discretionary spending and new items of direct spending

9

account for one-third, approximately one-third of the

10

Federal budget.
The discretionary spending part is the same

11
12

authority that the Presidents have clearly had since the

13

first Congress not to spend the full amount of

14

appropriated funds or to -- you know, to act with almost

15

complete discretion under lump sum appropriation

16

authority.

QUESTION:

This is --

GENERAL WAXMAN:

We're not saying that.

It's

not our position that, because the President has had

9

historical discretionary authority, when Congress has

10

given it to him,

to decline to spend items or to abolish

11

agencies,

12

no difference with taxes.

or transfer agency functions,

therefore there's

13

The point I was making with the Chief Justice

14

was the analogy between discretionary spending and what

15

the law calls new items of direct spending.

16

With respect to the tax provisions,

this ship is

17

prepared to stand on its own bottom,

18

that there is independent historical precedent for

19

Congress giving the President the discretionary authority

20

to decline to implement certain revenue provisions upon

21

the application of certain intelligible principles.

is the reason that the -- to uphold the tax provisions,

you say, is not to give the President total authority

under the Constitution to rule by decree, should Congress

QUESTION:

Yes.

And the intelligible principle, you

say, is not just, do what's in the public interest, it

11

is - - ?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

The intelligible principle is

12

that -- first of all, in order for there to be a targeted

13

tax cut, there has to be a baseline tax, but the President

14

must determine, number 1, that cancellation will reduce

15

the Federal budget deficit, and this is not, by the way,

16

as the other side contends, an ipso facto claim, because

17

many tax provisions are enacted on the notion and on the

18

budgetary assumption that they will generate additional

1

economic activity and raise taxes, and in that instance

20

the President would not be able to make that

21

determination -- raise money and provide more taxes.

22

Secondly, he must determine that it will not

23

impair any essential Government function, that it will not

24

harm the national interest, and in making those

25

determinations the President is directed to consider the

10

where 0MB and CBO are required to make daily -- weekly, if

11

not daily calculations about where we are in terms of the

12

budget baseline and the spending caps, there is a very

13

important purpose to be served by requiring the President

14

to decide yes or no, whether or not a particular item will

15

be cancelled, and then to give the Congress the authority,

17

to try and file -- to enact, consider and enact a

I think it

If Congress were to pass an Internal Revenue

this law if the cancellation would raise tax revenues and

not harm the United States, Congress would be abdicating

it's an unconstitutional repeal?
MR. COHEN:

9

Justice O'Connor, I think I win

10

either way.

I think that if you say there's no

11

substantive, intervening event between these two steps, a

12

long-winded President could take both steps literally in

13

the same breadth, if he were alone in the room he could

sign them in either order and just report what he's done,

15

that there is no substantive distinction, and that this is

a device to get around what General Waxman concedes would

be unconstitutional.
But I also think that if you take that first

step seriously, as a separate step, we now have an enacted

MR. COHEN:

No.

First of all, as I said before,

8

Justice Kennedy, it has no application to my Snake River

case, which particularly relates to the Internal Revenue

10

It's no -It's different, say, from simply

MR. COHEN:

Well, it's no different from the

23

effect of cancelling any other appropriation which

24

Congress would therefore have to reappropriate if it

25

wanted particular money spent.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE CITY OF NEW YORK

QUESTION:

Since we're already on the subject of

petitioner -- the respondents.

MR. COOPER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

9

Certainly, Justice O'Connor.

My friend General

10

Waxman says that the plaintiffs in the New York City case

have not got standing because they have not been denied a

a single dollar, but we nonetheless have actual harm and

You know, New York could change it's

the President has not allowed the United States Congress

It is unlikely in the extreme

10

he's going to allow little old HCFA to grant us these

you have to give your reasons, you have to look through

the entire thing carefully, taking into account its

4

history and purposes, and probably a word that might come

5

to mind is, is it pork?
All right.

6

Assuming that they tell the

7

President to do all that in respect to taxes, how is that

8

different than telling the FCC to go look through people

9

in the communications area and give licenses or not, or

10

make other rules and regs or not in respect to "the public

11

interest"?

12

13
14

If you can do the one under the Constitution,
why can't you do the other?
MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, we don't tell the FCC

15

that it can rescind a law, that it can render a law of no

16

force and effect.

17

President he may do.

18

That's what Congress has told the

General Waxman has said that repeals must

19

satisfy the Presentment Clause, and there's no room for

20

General Waxman or anyone else to argue otherwise.

QUESTION:

What about the lockbox effect?

you maintain there is no effect once there is a

cancellation?

Is there an effect on what Congress can

effect would there be if the statute, instead of using the

term cancel, and defining it to mean repeal, had said

repeal?

this statute.

There would be no difference in the operation of

And with respect to the lockbox specifically,

6

Your Honor, that simply makes clear that the President has

7

only a repeal power.

8

He can't take that money and do something he would prefer

9

to do with it, and neither can Congress.

He doesn't have a power of revision.

But if Congress

10

wants to spend that money again, whether it's in a lockbox

11

or not, what does it have to do?

13

It has to pass a new

And without the lockbox that would be true.

14

With the lockbox, that is true.

15

it may well be that they have to add another sentence to

16

the statute that they enacted.

17

QUESTION:

The only difference is,

No, but the lockbox puts into effect,

18

as I understand it -- correct me if I'm wrong -- certain

19

mechanisms under the Budget Deficit Reduction Act.

MR. COOPER:

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well --

So that here the President is making

22

one of two choices, each of which alter the situation from

23

where it was before the law was enacted in the first

place.

never met anyone who understood entirely the operation of

2

the lockbox, but it -- one thing that simply cannot be

3

escaped or blinked is the fact that when the President

4

cancels a provision, under the act itself, it extinguishes

5

the authority.

6

It extinguishes the law itself.

That operates on the law, not the money.

This

7

isn't a spending discretion, and the Solicitor General has

8

made a very powerful presentation for the proposition that

9

Congress can give sweeping spending authority to the

10

President and has since the First Congress.

11

resist that.

12

QUESTION:

We don't

May I ask you, Mr. Cooper, because I

13

frankly am troubled with this lockbox idea, but is it any

14

different if, after the particular item is put in the

15

lockbox, than if it had never been enacted in the first

16

place and, if so, what is the difference, the particular

17

provision that goes into the lockbox?

18

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, I honestly am not

19

entirely sure, but I will grant the Solicitor General that

20

it may well be that that money is treated differently than

21

if it had never --

22

QUESTION:

It's counted against what

23

expenditures have been made.

Even if the President

24

ultimately doesn't use it, it's counted, since the law has

25

been passed which authorized it.

MR. COOPER:

Yes, but I think it's a function of

fact that the money came into existence,

the authority to
