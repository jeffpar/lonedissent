ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. BROWN WALLACE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Oklahoma State courts have entered a money

12

judgment against the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma.

They have

13

entered that judgment notwithstanding the fact that

14

neither the tribe nor Congress have weighed the tribe's

15

inherent immunity to suit, and despite the fact that in

16

the very note sued upon, the parties agreed that nothing

17

in that note would subject or limit the sovereign rights

18

of the Kiowa Tribe.

19

This is one of a series of judgments that has

20

been entered against the Kiowa Tribe that arises out of

21

the same transaction, same series of transactions.

22

enforcement of these judgments has resulted in a seizure

23

of the tribal tax revenues, an enjoining of the tribe from

24

enforcing tribal law on tribal land, a garnishment of the

25

tribal bank accounts, even accounts containing federally

appropriated funds, and generally a draining of the tribal

2

treasury to the point of crippling the tribe's ability to

3

maintain its governmental functions.

4

QUESTION:

Well, are those issues that you

5

mentioned just now, are they necessarily involved in this

6

case?

7

MR. WALLACE:

They are involved in the case, in

8

this case to the extent that they show the true impact of

9

the judgment and some of the policy reasons why Congress

10

has not elected to waive the sovereign immunity of tribes.
QUESTION:

11

It is quite possible, it seems to me,

12

that a State court might have jurisdiction to enter a

13

judgment but perhaps not have the jurisdiction to do some

14

of the things which you describe as having happened in

15

this case.

16

MR. WALLACE:

I think you would have to look

17

more deeply at what kind of judgment, and whether or not

18

there was in fact a waiver.

19

Now, if we assume that there was no waiver, I

20

would take the position that the judgment could be at best

21

declaratory, and relating to the application of tribal --

22

the application of State, regulatory, or taxation laws to

23

the tribe when it's operating certainly without tribal

24

country, and in some cases I think the State taxation laws

25

should be respected by the tribe within Indian country.

QUESTION:

Well, suppose there had been a

2

waiver, would you think that these actions could then have

3

been undertaken?

4

waives its sovereign immunity I don't think that means

5

that whoever gets the judgment can move in and cart off

6

money from the Federal Treasury.

7

MR. WALLACE:

I mean, when the Federal Government

Well, that's true, Your Honor, and

8

it depends very much on how the waiver is structured.

9

Typically, when tribes engage in the activity of waiving

10

their immunity they not only select a court that they're

11

going to go into, designate the kind of causes of action

12

that they will be subject to, but they also regulate the

3
4

extent to which they expose their assets to court process.
QUESTION:

But suppose they didn't.

I mean, I

5

would be just as concerned about the effects that you're

6

concerned about here in that situation where there was a

7

waiver, without saying anything about what you can do to

8

the tribe to enforce the liability.

9

MR. WALLACE:

Well, in representing a tribe in

20

that situation I would certainly take the position that

21

until there is a waiver with respect to what assets can be

22

subjected to the judgment, then the waiver is incomplete,

23

that in order to have a complete and effective waiver so

24

that a judgment can be entered and can be enforced, the

25

waiver has got to have the court agreeing that it -5

1

excuse me, have the tribe agreeing that it will be subject

2

to court process, and then the enforcement must also be

3

specifically covered.
QUESTION:

4

So that if the tribe said, the tribe

5

hereby waives sovereign immunity for liability on this

6

note, that would be insufficient to waive immunity if a

7

court ordered execution or attachment of a tribal bank

8

account.
MR. WALLACE:

9

I think it's in -- yes.

I think

LO

it's insufficient because it fails to designate the

LI

property, the sovereign property to which the waiver

L2

attaches.

L3

has two basic concepts.

L4

sovereign to subject itself to court jurisdiction, in

L5

essence the agreement to create jurisdiction in a court,

L6

and then the second concept is the enforcement, the

L7

designation of exactly what remedial devices that the

L8

sovereign will be subject to.

L9

QUESTION:

The -- you know, the immunity of a sovereign
Number 1, the agreement of the

I just don't know if it's the

20

tradition in our law to parse and separate sovereign

21

immunity into those two components or not.

22

MR. WALLACE:

State statutes that deal with

23

State sovereign immunity very regularly say the State will

24

agree to be sued for these causes of action, and then very

25

regularly address the means of enforcement of those causes

QUESTION:

That is one of the devices that's

Oklahoma in fact does use that device.

I'm

That is certainly not the case, I am

sure, with regard to foreign sovereign immunity under the

10

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, where a foreign

11

sovereign is liable for its commercial activities --

3

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Foreign sovereign --

-- and I'm quite sure that even when

4

there's been no waiver what you can do is, if the foreign

5

sovereign has a bank account in this country, you can move

6

against the bank account, period.

7

MR. WALLACE:

Yes, sir.

The Foreign Sovereign

8

Immunities Act proceeds on a slightly different theory

9

with respect to the handling of sovereign immunity.

20

That's a situation where you have the foreign sovereign

21

dealing with the immunity of another sovereign.

22

In the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the

23

legislature has chosen to respect the assets of the

24

foreign sovereign by desig -- or by limiting some of the

25

assets that are subject to attachment.

4

QUESTION:

I must confess, I'm a little puzzled

by --

5

MR. WALLACE:

6

QUESTION:

Excuse me?

-- the discussion.

There's no waiver

7

in this case, is there?

8

The question is whether there's anything that needs to be

9

waived.

Isn't that the issue?
MR. WALLACE:

10

Why are we talking about waiver?

Well, that's true.

This case does

11

not have a waiver or any language in it that even purports

12

to be a waiver.

13

Oklahoma has concluded that its courts have inherent

14

jurisdiction over an Indian tribe, and it does not need

15

the federally required consent to suit or waiver of

16

immunity in order to create jurisdiction in Oklahoma

17

courts.

18

This is a situation where the State of

The reason why it's concluded that is, Oklahoma

19

has said that when the Kiowa Tribe engaged in commerce off

20

of Kiowa country, then it did away with the Federal

21

requirement that jurisdiction be created by consent or

22

waiver.

QUESTION:

Now, that's the question we have

here, is it not?
MR. WALLACE:

That's -- yes, sir.

QUESTION:

In so holding was the Oklahoma court

in effect accepting the invitation -- maybe that's too

8

strong a word, at least the suggestion in the, what was

9

it, the Cabazon case that in fact that might be the case.

10

11

Didn't this Court suggest that that might be possible?
MR. WALLACE:

I can remember a point in a

12

concurring opinion in Citizen Band Potawatomi where there

13

were -- where there was a question raised with respect to

14

whether the immunity of a tribe would apply to commercial

15

activities off of Indian country, yes, sir, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Now, why was the

Why was the Oklahoma court wrong?

MR. WALLACE:

The Congress is vested with

19

exclusive control over tribal sovereignty and tribal

20

immunity as a part of tribal sovereignty.

Congress has

21

never drawn that line in tribal immunity.

In fact, when

22

Congress approaches the issue of tribal immunity, it

23

consistently expresses its approval of the doctrine.

the reservation were subject to nondiscriminatory State

2

taxes, didn't we?

3

MR. WALLACE:

Absent -- yes, absent Federal law

4

to the contrary, the Court held that the activities were

5

subject to nondiscriminatory State taxes.

6

QUESTION:

So to say, absent Federal law to the

7

contrary, these activities are subject to State authority

8

suggests that the Congress would have to affirmatively

9

prohibit the jurisdiction, rather than affirmatively

10
11

authorize it, the way you're talking.
MR. WALLACE:

I think the problem with the line

12

of reasoning there is a couplefold.

Number one, Mescalero

13

did not involve immunity to suit.

14

about immunity with respect to taxation.

15

characteristically treated the tribes' immunity with

16

respect to taxation and regulation very differently than

17

it has the treated tribes' immunity to suit.

Mescalero was talking
This Court has

18

As an example, I take you to the Citizen Band

19

case, where the issue was whether or not Oklahoma could

20

require a tribe to collect Oklahoma's cigarette taxes for

21

on-reservation sales to nonmembers.

22

You said, yes, it could, but when Oklahoma then

23

asked for a judgment against the tribe, a money judgment

24

against the tribe for taxes that hadn't been collected,

25

the Court went directly to the issue, or directly to the

point of tribal immunity to suit, and pointed out that

2

Congress has long approved it, Congress uses it as a part

3

of its overall policy with respect to Indian tribes, and

4

the Court was not, under those circumstances, disposed to

5

modify its longstanding approval of tribal immunity.
QUESTION:

6

But Mr. Wallace, it has to come from

7

some place originally.

the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

It can't just say, well, we'll leave it to

MR. WALLACE:

Yes, and the Court has found in

14

the past that the immunity exists as an aspect, an

15

inherent aspect of a sovereign that preexists the

The Court has recog --

QUESTION:

But then you're distinguishing the

18

tribes as sovereign from a sister State as sovereign, from

19

a foreign nation as sovereign.
MR. WALLACE:

20

Yes, Your Honor, and I think the

21

distinction is probably valid.

Tribes have a unique

relationship with the Federal Government.

MR. DUMONT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

21

I think the problem here is a State court did --

22

entered a judgment which did two things, it held that as a

23

matter of State law the tribe was not immune from suit,

and that's wrong for two reasons.

25

1

and second, Federal law, Federal substantive law preserves

2

the tribe's immunity from suit, and let me just address

3

those for moment.

4

The -- I think it should be common ground that

5

this is a matter of Federal law, supervening Federal law,

6

so if we move to the substance of the Federal law, the

7

rule derives from -- as my colleague said, it originally

8

derives from the preconstitutional sovereign status of the

9

tribes, and this Court has made that clear repeatedly.
Now, it is also supported in the modern context

10
11

by at least three very firm foundations.

12

powerful general background principle of what sovereign

13

immunity from suit means, second, the history of the

14

Federal Government's relationship with the tribes,

15

Government to Government, and this Court's precedents, and

16

third, the critical practical importance of immunity from

17

suit from money judgments to the tribes in modern-day

18

America.

19

QUESTION:

First, the

Well, let's talk about the practical

20

importance a minute.

With increasing commercial activity

21

between tribes and nontribal members off the reservation

22

there may be, indeed, a need for some waiver of sovereign

23

immunity to make it possible for tribes to have -- enter

24

into business dealings with people off the reservation.

25

Is Congress considering legislation about this right now,

2

do you know, Mr. DuMont?
MR. DUMONT:

They are actively considering it.

3

Hearings, extensive hearings were held in 1996.

4

a bill which passed the Senate which would have waived

5

immunity in certain circumstances in '97.

6

was removed on the premise, publicly stated, that hearings

7

would be held by April 30th of 1998, and those hearings

8

have been tentatively scheduled by the Committee on Indian

9

Affairs of the Senate.

10

QUESTION:

There was

That provision

But Congress is debating the

11

desirability, or lack thereof, of certain waivers of

12

sovereign immunity.

13

MR. DUMONT:

That's absolutely correct, and

14

Congress as long ago as 1934 in the Indian Reorganization

15

Act recognized exactly this issue that you bring up about,

16

and that the Oklahoma courts adverted to as a matter of

17

policy, which is, will anyone deal with the tribes, and

18

they provided in the Oklahoma Welfare -- Indian Welfare

19

Act, for one thing, for not only the incorporation of

20

tribal governments as governments, but also separate

21

incorporation as business entities, and those entities are

22

or may be subject to suit in certain circumstances,

23

limited to their business property, just like a normal

24

corporation would be.

about it again.

They really --

QUESTION:

Have they ever passed a statute

saying the tribes have immunity?

There are a number of statutes, I

Is there any statute in which Congress has expressly said

tribes shall have immunity?

MR. DUMONT:

I'm not aware of any statute that

4

says that in those terms.

5

though, that to pass a statute saying the tribe's immunity

6

will be waived in the following circumstances, or under

we assume the background principle is immunity.

13

MR. DUMONT:

You would have had to wait for

14

Congress, and I would say that because the original common

15

law, if you will, recognition of the foreign -- of the

16

scope of a foreign sovereign's immunity came so early in

17

this Court's history and this country's history in the

18

Schooner Exchange case that by the time you got to the

19

1950's, when the State Department was recognizing the

20

commercial exception, it was already firmly settled in

21

this Court's jurisprudence.
The Berizzi Brothers case in 1926, for instance,

22

23

made clear that extended to commercial property of a

24

sovereign.

MR. DUMONT:

2

If circumstances dramatically

3

change, then it is always the prerogative of the sovereign

4

to make its own decisions about what cases its courts will

5

entertain, and that's true from the Schooner Exchange on,

6

but the question here would be who would represent the

7

sovereign of the United States, and this Court had made

8

clear consistently that the default rule was going to be

9

absolute immunity, and it was then up to Congress to vary

10

that.
QUESTION:

11

Then what was going on with the Tate

12

letter?

13

courts were recognizing that there were occasions where

14

the sovereign was not immune, and Congress had passed no

15

legislation.

16

Before the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act,

MR. DUMONT:

I think what the courts had

17

recognized was that in cases where the State Department

18

was willing to represent to the Court that it was

19

important -- that it was not important that immunity

should not be recognized, then the courts would frequently

submission is merely that the Court's policy -- whether

2

the Court had the power to do it or not, it may very well

have had the power to see a development in common law, but

4

the Court did not do that.
The Court said, look, we have always -- and

Berizzi Brothers is the prime case on this.

said we have always applied a rule of absolute immunity.

We see no reason to make an exception for commercial

Now, of course, in situations where the

different, then we will do something different, but the

out that in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act Congress

was able to consider the problem holistically and to

address issues like forum.

6

There are provisions about what property of the sovereign

you can attach for a judgment, and issues like damages.

8

There are limitations on the kind of damages that apply.

There's automatic removal for

9

Now, as to States, first of all there's a bit of

10

a canard going around that State sovereignty doesn't exist

11

any more, but that's only as the States have waived it,

12

and in Nevada v. Hall the Court recognized that some of

13

those waivers are very limited, and those apply to the

14

court -- the State's own courts.

15

Now, as to Nevada v. Hall itself, that rests on

16

a premise that the States were independent sovereigns when

17

they went into the compact of the Constitution, and the

18

Court found nothing in the Constitution that purported to

19

give away each State's right to subject another sister

20

State to its own jurisdiction, but what the States did

21

give away was their ability to regulate Indian tribes and

22

their ability to regulate Indian affairs.

That became a

matter of exclusive Federal jurisdiction.

pellucid under the Court's cases.

MR. DUMONT:

Are

Again, regulatory power has to be

4

distinguished, but I think it is true with respect to

that effectively did was to freeze into place a Federal

common law rule which, Nevada v. Hall recognized that if

you had looked at that rule at the time of the

Constitution you would have said that every State would

that when Congress applied parts of the Fourteenth

The expression of the inability of money damage,

a suit being brought against the tribe, was looked at in

Potawatomi, Citizens Band Potawatomi, and there the State

was found to have sufficient interest in the activity, the

look at it as a doctrine about the relationship between

sovereign A and sovereign B whose courts assert judicial

says their relationship is such that B's courts should not

QUESTION:

Well, that -- historically that is

with respect to legislative or regulatory jurisdiction,

but we're now talking about judicial jurisdiction, and I'm

7

not sure that it -- anything follows with respect to

judicial jurisdiction.

9

MR. PATTERSON:

The -- if I may answer

10

indirectly, the rationale of Potawatomi in separating

11

regulatory and adjudicatory authority of the State in that

12

case, it was critical that the activities there involved

13

took place on State land -- I'm sorry, on tribal lands.

14

The first ruling of the Court was to the effect

15

that the lands, which were lands which had been purchased

16

and held in trust, were held in trust for the tribe, were

17

in fact tribal lands sufficient to invoke jurisdiction --

18

invoke immunity.

19

When you move then, though, to Mescalero Apache,

20

you go to an activity which is off tribal lands and now

21

you have to look once again at the question whether or not

22

there is tribal sovereign immunity for acts which take

23

place off lands, off tribal lands, and this Court found in

24

Mescalero that there was no immunity for off-reservation

There are State contract laws.

To run down the line, when the tribe goes off
