ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MS. SOLOMON:

Why

1

Federal questions the Federal courts have more expertise

2

with the questions, they tend to see them more often, and

3

we find that that gives us greater predictability as we

4

try to assess litigation risks.

5

When there is case law in the Federal courts, as

6

there was on all of the Federal claims that ICS pled in

7

this case, we can review that case law, and we can make a

8

determination whether we should litigate or whether we

9

should settle.

10

In State court, because the cases are not so

11

frequently litigated there, there's a paucity of case law

12

on some subjects.

13

QUESTION:

Well, this was a mix of issues.

14

There was a -- Chicago wanted presumably to -- well, the

15

respondents, I guess, had sought administrative review of

16

the decision.

17

MS. SOLOMON:

Respondents sought a variety of

18

things, Your Honor.

Respondents sought to have the

19

ordinance declared - - the landmarks ordinance declared

20

unconstitutional, to have the specific ordinance

21

delegating ICS's property as a landmark declared

22

unconstitutional, to have a variety of State law claims

23

litigated in the first instance, they had takings claims,

24

nondelegation claims, vested rights -- they had five State

25

law claims.

They also had two claims that were presented

1

on the administrative record, so there were a variety of

2

claims.

3

QUESTION:

But to the extent this was brought as

4

a review of a municipal agency decision, to the extent

5

that this was a review of the decision of the Landmarks

6

Commission, I was struck by the comment that the Ninth

7

Circuit made in its recent decision that the prospect of a

8

Federal court sitting as an appellate court over State

9

administrative proceedings is rather jarring.

Indeed,

10

it's so jarring that I don't know of any instance of a

11

court other than this Court sitting in direct review of a

12

State court proceeding.
MS. SOLOMON:

13

Justice Ginsburg, the Ninth

14

Circuit case, like the Armistead case and the Fairfax

15

County case that were also recently decided in the courts

16

of appeals, are diversity cases.

case.

18

one was removed to the Federal court on the basis of

19

Federal questions.

20

They are unlike this

Of all the recent courts of appeals cases only this

QUESTION:

But my question was the function of

21

lower appellate courts vis-a-vis State agencies, and even

22

in the Federal question domain, I know of no precedent

23

where a district court, or even a court of appeals, sits

24

as an appellate reviewer as distinguished from -- a case

25

might come up, say on habeas, on collateral review, but to

1

my knowledge only this Court, from the highest court of

2

the State, acts in the direct review line, so I don't know

3

any precedent for this Court, for a lower court, for a

4

district court sitting in direct review of a decision of a

5

State agency.
MS. SOLOMON:

6

Our argument on that, Your Honor,

7

is in two parts.

It is first that the district court had

8

original jurisdiction over the civil claim, over the

9

portion of ICS's complaint that fell within the district

10

court's original jurisdiction.

11

constitutional violations, and on the strength of those

12

Federal constitutional violations, we removed the case to

13

district court.
QUESTION:

14

ICS pled numerous Federal

20

It violates the State

It violates the State constitution.

It violates the

My question really is, isn't the implication of

21

the argument you're making today that every decision of

22

every licensing board in every city can become -- can have

23

a right of initial access to a Federal forum?

24
25

MS. SOLOMON:

Our argument, Your Honor, rests on

the plain language of section 1441, which permits -6

1

QUESTION:

Well, do I follow -- I followed your

2

argument and it seemed to me that was right.

3

1441(c), which requires the case to be within the original

4

jurisdiction of the district court, then all of these

5

cases could start out -- you're removing, but you can't

6

remove what couldn't start there, so am I correct that as

7

you read the statute any agency decision at the State

8

level, so long as there is a Federal claim stuck in there

9

by the plaintiff, could be begun in the Federal court?

10

MS. SOLOMON:

Your Honor is correct.

Looking at

We

11

certainly make no distinction between a case that could be

12

begun in the Federal district court, or a case that could

13

be removed to the district court.

14

and 1441 are certainly the same.

15

that opens the floodgates, for a variety of reasons.

16

First of all, as Your Honor points out, there has to be at

17

least a substantial Federal question in the case,

18

something that would make it a civil action.

19

The language of 1331
But we don't think that

Now, we rely on the presence of the substantial

20

Federal claims in this case to say that this was a civil

21

action within original jurisdiction.

22

section 1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, which

23

provides the district court with additional supplemental

24

jurisdiction over all other claims that are related to the

25

claim within the original jurisdiction of the district

court.

2

Now,

in the other cases,

the other courts of

3

appeals cases that went -- that were removed on the basis

4

of diversity,

5

don't make an argument here about the diversity cases.

6

Our argument is that, under the plain terms of section

1441,

8

civil action within original jurisdiction --

We

the Federal allegations in this complaint were a

MS. SOLOMON:

12

that element might well be lacking.

We don't make that argument,

Justice O'Connor.

14

QUESTION:

Well, what is your answer?

15

MS. SOLOMON:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. SOLOMON:

Our answer is - -

Was it a civil action at that stage?
It was not.

1

So it becomes a civil action at the

2

first time that it goes to a State court of general

3

jurisdiction?

I mean, is that what we --

At a minimum, Your Honor, yes.

not have counterparts in State law.

MS. SOLOMON:

You find it in a particular

Well, the term civil action, as we

10

describe in our brief, is a historical term.

11

components civil and action are well-described in this

12

Court's cases.

something that is criminal, so the case was clearly a

14

civil action.

The

Civil is used only in contradistinction to

It was clearly civil.

Let me say that.

It was also an action, as the Court described,

for example, in the Upshur case and a variety of the other

cases.

Ginsburg's earlier questions, and she indicated that this

was jarring, in California as in some other States there

the point at which, when the aggrieved party goes to the

State court of appeals, there could be an action in United

States district - - it could be removed to the United

States district court?

5

MS. SOLOMON:

Justice Kennedy, it might be

different in some other situations, but what we have here

in this case was a complaint filed in the Circuit Court of

8

Cook County, and at that point we filed a notice of

QUESTION:

10

What about the instance I explained,

11

where you go from the agency directly to the three-judge

12

court of appeals in California.

13

MS. SOLOMON:

QUESTION:

I --

It's State system, and as I

15

understand your argument, at that point the defendant

16

could remove to a United States district court.

17

MS. SOLOMON:

I would see no basis for saying

18

that that was something other than a civil action.

19

it's civil as opposed to criminal, and if it is an action,

as the Court has described, as I said, in a variety of

cases - -

But it would be just as

straightforward.

So your point is, you could remove

whether the State puts its review in the middle tier or in

MS. SOLOMON:

They're equally removable.

Our point, Your Honor, yes, is

that any -- by the plain terms of section 1441, a statute

Stop right there, because there in

We don't see that, Justice

on its face, it was unconstitutional as applied, at the

point that they were deciding how to obtain judicial

MS. SOLOMON:

Because that's contrary to

Your Honor, we do take that

position, and I don't think it's counter to the Stude

7

case, if I could explain.

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

MS. SOLOMON:

The Stude case, as you are aware,

10

had two portions, one seeking an original filing in the

11

district court and the other seeking removal on the basis

12

of diversity.

13

As for the removal portion, the Court indicated

14

it could not be removed because under Federal law,

15

regardless of how Iowa labeled the parties, under Federal

16

law the railroad was the plaintiff, and the plaintiff

17

could not remove.

18

As for the other portion, the portion originally

19

filed within -- filed as a diversity action in the

20

district court, the Court indicated that the defect in

21

that case was simply that the railroad was attempting to

22

obtain review only of the question of damages.

attempting to separate the question of damages from the

underlying liability.

I don't believe you do, Your

And as a result, none of it could.

20

The Seventh Circuit's view was that this was not a civil

2

say that for two reasons.

3

First of all, because Stude was a de novo

4

proceeding, whatever that language means -- and we

indicate in our brief what we think it means.

6

means, cannot separate the question of damages, but

7

whatever that language means, the Court could not have

8

been referring to a case within deferential review,

9

because that was not what the Stude case was.

10

We think it

Stude was a case about de novo review, and the

11

Court subsequently made clear in Horton that any case that

12

does require de novo review is within the original

13

jurisdiction.

That's the holding of Califano v. Sanders, and

2

3

if that is incorrect, as the Court held in Califano, there

4

simply is no basis under which to review --

5

QUESTION:

But it was really en passant in

6

Sanders, wasn't it, because the main thing that was held

7

there was that you didn't have 1331 review in these social

8

security cases and, as I recall, didn't the Chief write

9

separately to say there was no need to discuss 1331 at

10

all, because the review route under the Social Security

11

Act was 205?
MS. SOLOMON:

12

The question in Califano, Your

13

Honor, as we understand it was, is there jurisdiction

14

under the Administrative Procedure Act itself, and in that

15

sense the Court did kind of back into the discussion on

1331.

MS. SOLOMON:

The holding as we understand it,

certiorari on because it was a conflict in the circuits on

that question.

7

And the Court says, well, you know, we actually

8

don't have to decide that any more, because since we

9

granted certiorari the Congress has amended 1331 to delete

10

the jurisdictional amount, and whatever impediment there

11

might have been before, there isn't now, we read section

MS. SOLOMON:

I hope I haven't confused the --

The -- what the cases say, and Upshur

Califano didn't have, and the one -- I guess the feature

2

which is perhaps more jolting to me than others, is that

3

even though the review is deferential, it's still a

4

deferential review which ultimately turns on making value

judgments on State policy, aesthetic judgments about the

character of the neighborhood here, economic judgments

about hardship.

And if, in fact, that is going to be a constant

for abstention of those particular --on those particular

5

Circuit Court of Cook County under the Illinois

6

Administrative Review Act, and what the respondents did in

this case was exactly to follow that ordinance, and we

filed a one-count -- I mean, no count.

9

simply a complaint for administrative review, and the

11

The complaint was

elements of that were very, very simple.
We had to file two complaints for administrative

12

review, one from the decision of the commission denying

13

the demolition permit, the second from the commission's

14

decision denying the economic hardship exception, and we

15

also had to file a third action from the decision of the

16

Chicago Plan Commission denying our application under the

17

Chicago and Lake Michigan lake front protection ordinance,

so we had three cases that we had to go to court with at

that point.

We were well aware that we might have exercised

MR. BRENNAN:

very clear and is very simple, and it's found in Califano.
In Califano this Court found that there was

jurisdiction to review decisions of Federal agencies under

analysis, the correct analysis and the bar is that this

Justice Ginsburg, as I read Stude

inquiry all four of those courts have made is, what is the

MR. BRENNAN:

QUESTION:

No.

-- a review of Federal administrative

action.

4

MR. BRENNAN:

The existing jurisdictional

5

statutes, any one of the three first provisions of 1441,

6

the removal statute, never speak to the issue and never

7

have any - - do not have any language in them that supports

8

the idea that district courts have jurisdiction over civil

9

actions within their original jurisdiction where there are

10

State appellate reviews involved.
QUESTION:

11

The question was, in Califano was

12

review or not, not review which court, because if it was

13

going to be any court it was going to be the Federal

14

court.

15

MR. BRENNAN:

Well, exactly, because it was the

16

action of a Federal agency, and the suit was filed against

17

the Social Security Administration.

QUESTION:

But you conceded that if you had

19

divided up your complaint - - you want review of the land

questions in Federal court - - that you could have done

that, so why can't the city remove at least to the extent

that you have a divisible complaint?

we can remove the part that's pure Federal, and for the

2

rest, the State claims, district court you can either

3

exercise supplemental jurisdiction or remand those.

4

couldn't the city say, at least to the extent that there

5

are Federal claims here, it's removable?
MR. BRENNAN:

6

Why

Because 1441(c) says whenever a

7

separate and independent claim or a cause of action within

8

the jurisdiction conferred by section 1331 is joined with

9

a nonremovable action, and you don't --we never pass the

10

first test.

This is never an action under 1331, because

11

under 1331 it must be a civil action within the original

12

jurisdiction of the district court.
QUESTION:

13

Moreover, isn't it true, as I read

14

the complaint, that most of your Federal claims are --

15

overlap State law claims that would be based on precisely

16

the same factual disputes?
MR. BRENNAN:

Yes, that is true, Justice

MR. BRENNAN:

I think that analysis is sound,

Justice Scalia, and I think it's sound because it begins

with the point that this cause of action arises in a State

statute in a city ordinance, and for us to have marched

down to Federal court and tried to file it there, most

MR. BRENNAN:

1

I think I'm saying two things,

2

Justice Ginsburg.

3

Califano the Court found that there was jurisdiction to

4

review the Federal agency because of the amendment that

5

was made in 1976 to 1331.

The first thing I'm saying is that in

The Court did not address at all the issue of

6

7

whether the Federal courts have original jurisdiction over

8

State administrative agency actions, and my basic point is

9

that there is no Federal statute that one can point to

10

which clearly intends to give the district courts

11

appellate jurisdiction over final decisions of State

12

administrative agencies, and that would include those

13

cases where there is some Federal constitutional claim in

14

them.
Another reason why that rule makes a great deal

15
16

of sense is that in all these administrative review cases,

17

whether they come out of liquor agencies or aviation

18

authorities or zoning authorities, the Federal

19

constitutional questions should not be addressed until the

20

plaintiff has failed to prevail on any of the State law

21

issues.

22

QUESTION:

I -- that's -- I don't know if

23

Justice Scalia's idea is so sound.

you're trying to do is to carve out some kind of special

MR. BRENNAN:

Well, that's true, Justice

Kennedy, but I still contend that the point that gets me

there that says that the district court does not have

jurisdiction in this case is that there is no provision in

the U.S. Code in the removal statute or in the

QUESTION:

so forth of the United States.
And it seems to me you might arguably take the

3

position that there's a distinction between civil actions

4

arising, et cetera, on the one hand and Federal claims on

5

the other, and it may well be that an action that arises

6

under a State statute like this, even though it includes

7

Federal claims, does not arise under the Federal, so forth

8

and so on, within the meaning of that provision.

9

If you don't take that position, I don't know

10

how you get to your destination.

11

MR. BRENNAN:

Well, I get to my destination by

12

saying that 1331 speaks about the district courts having

-- of civil actions, and this is

decided by the four circuits, it seems to me what the

court in each one of those cases has done, as well as

20

other cases that are cited in the brief, is they look at

21

what they characterize as the nature of the action, and

How do you distinguish Sanders in

that event, because surely there was a final agency action

there.

4

MR. BRENNAN:

Sure, and I don't think -- it

5

doesn't appear to me that Sanders as filed was necessarily

6

an appellate action.

7
8

There are two reasons that I think Sanders is
distinguishable.

The first is that while there was a

decision of the Social Security Administration, the action
10

that was filed was really a de novo action that challenged

11

that decision, secondly in Sanders is distinguishable,

12

because there you're talking about Federal court

13

jurisdiction over Federal administrative agencies, and I'm

not troubled by that, and I don't think the Court is

a way that you haven't.
If you're relying on the definition of civil

2

3

action or something else, that needn't bother you.

4

MR. BRENNAN:

Well, if -- I guess what I would

5

suggest, Mr. Chief Justice, is that Sanders does not in

6

any way support the proposition that the city is arguing

7

here that State - - that Federal district courts should

8

have jurisdiction over cases which are of their very

9

nature appeals from State administrative agencies.
QUESTION:

10

Yes, but your key distinction should

11

not be the distinction between appellate and original, but

12

rather between arising under Federal law on the one hand

13

and arising under State law on the other.
It seems to me you might make a colorable

14
15

argument that this case, notwithstanding the presence of

16

Federal claims, really arises under the State

17

administrative review statute, and therefore it doesn't

18

come within 1331.
MR. BRENNAN:

QUESTION:

What's your response to my argument?

Do you understand it?
MS. SOLOMON:
QUESTION:

Arising under --

My suggested reading, that although

11

the claim is a Federal claim, that the viewing the action

12

as a whole as distinguished from claims in the

13

supplemental jurisdiction statute -- you use the word

14

claims, not actions -- that the action itself didn't arise

15

under the Federal law.

16

MS. SOLOMON:

Our response to that quite simply

17

is the Gully test, the Gully test of arising under any

18

right or immunity as in the claims that ICS alleged in

19

this case, the Federal constitutional claims would be

20

decided solely by reference to the Federal Constitution.

21

They're not decided as a matter of State law.

22

The arising under cases, where a court considers

23

a State cause of action and finds that it does not arise

24

under, as we read the cases are limited to two

25

circumstances, first where the plaintiff actually forgoes

any Federal claims, and ICS did nothing if not plead

2

numerous Federal constitutional claims.

3

The second is the situation in Merrell Dow,

4

where Federal law intentionally precluded a right of

5

action, or there was no Federal right of action, and there

6

was a Federal right of action for each and every

7

constitutional allegation that ICS pled in its complaint.

8

9

The only basis on which the court of appeals
dismissed the entire case was that the mere presence in

10

the complaint of some few claims that would be reviewed on

11

the record required it to remand the entire case.

12

ICS does not embrace that theory of contagion, and for

13

good reason, because the Federal claims were within the

14

district court's original jurisdiction, and the State law

15

claims were within the district court's supplemental

16

jurisdiction, and they were all properly decided in the

17

district court.

Thank you.
