ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. RICHARD OREN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

11

MR. OREN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case comes before you today as a result of

12

the dismissal of an indictment by the District Court in

13

the Northern District of Indiana in April of 1995, prior

14

to the taking of any evidence in the case.

15

challenge to the sufficiency of the --of the indictment

16

actually began many months prior to that in an official

17

conference I had with Mr. Bates in my office.

18

time we went over the indictment paragraph by paragraph.

19

However, the

At that

At the end of that process, Mr. Bates thought

20

for a minute; he looked at me, and he said:

Yes, but what

21

is it they're telling me I did wrong?

22

Mr. Bates, I believe that they're saying that you

23

misapplied Federal student loan funds.

24

about that for a minute and then he said to me:

25

understand that, but what is it specifically they're

And I said:

Well,

Mr. Bates thought

Yes, I

1

saying I did that was illegal?

2

looked at the indictment and I found that I could not

3

really answer that question for him.

4

And I went back and I

I believe that exchange underscores the

5

importance of this Court's standard for judging the

6

sufficiency of an indictment.

7

elements of the offense charged must be stated and that

8

the indictment should fairly inform the defendant of the

9

charges against him, as well as be sufficiently specific

That being that all

10

to stand as a bar to further prosecutions should there be

11

a conviction or an acquittal.
So what I'm asking of this Court is to strictly

12

13

examine the indictment that was brought before Mr.

14

Bates -- that was brought against Mr. Bates.
QUESTION:

15

When you -- you say strictly examine,

16

Mr. Oren, are you suggesting some extremely skeptical

17

scrutiny of the language of an indictment?
MR. OREN:

18

No, not extremely skeptical, Your

19

Honor.

20

prior to evidence being taken, the only thing we have to

21

look at is the indictment.

22

after evidence had been taken, then I think that if there

23

was no prejudice shown, then if the indictment was not

24

sufficient, it would still not really --

25

I -- I believe I'm using that in the sense that

If -- if there was dismissal

look at is the indictment and nothing more than that?
MR. OREN:

3

That's -- that's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice.

The indictment here is set forth in the joint

5

appendix at pages 2 through 12.

in two portions.

7

background factual allegations.

8

are 12 specific charging counts, if you will.

9

It is actually structured

The first portion is a series of basic
And the second portion

Directing the Court's attention to the first,

10

the factual allegations, it provides, first of all,

11

various background information and then some specific

12

allegations of conduct against Mr. Bates -- or by

13

Mr. Bates.

14

that a James and Laurenda Jackson owned the Ax - - Acme

15

Institute of Technology.

As a background information, it -- it alleges

QUESTION:

16

Now -- now, Mr. -- Mr. Oren, the

17

question presented here in the petition for certiorari is

18

whether intent to injure or defraud the government is an

19

element of the offense of knowingly and willingly --

20

willfully misapplying Federal student loan funds, in

21

violation of the statutory section.

22

the - - the government apparently agrees that the

23

indictment does not contain any allegation that it was

24

done with an intent to injure or defraud the United

25

States.

And I -- I think

So the question we have before us, as I would

Is that an element of -- of the

And I don't see why we need to be concerned with
the various detailed allegations of the indictment.

5

MR. OREN:

My reasoning for bringing this to the

6

Court's attention is that the -- again, the sufficiency of

7

the indictment depends, I believe, on the actual setting

8

forth of the elements of the offense in the indictment.

9

And - QUESTION:

10

Yes, but we're -- we're not

11

canvassing the indictment for some shortcoming.

It's a

12

very precise issues that's -- that you have presented in

13

the question for certiorari.

14

MR. OREN:

Yes, all right.

15

Assuming, then, that the government is agreeing

16

that there is no factual allegations alleging - - of the

17

elements of the -- of the offense, as we believe it to

18

be - QUESTION:

19

Well, there's no agreement on whether

20

it's an element of the offense.

21

fraudulent intent is an element, is ‘‘here -- there's no

agreement?

MR. OREN:

I mean, whether

No, there is not.

It is my

24

understanding that, at least in the courts below, the

25

government has agreed that conversion, or un - 6

1

unauthorized use of property to the benefit of the

2

defendant or a third party, is an element of the offense.

3

But where there is no agreement between the government and

4

Mr. Bates is that -- whether or not fraudulent intent or

5

criminal intent is an element of the offense of knowingly

and willfully misapplying student loan funds.

MR. OREN:

Well, this does present an issue of

12

statutory construction, Justice Ginsburg.

13

there are four principles that - - of statutory

14

construction that would support this reading.

15

of that is -- the first principle would be the actual

16

language of the statute itself.

indications in there that --of the scienter element.

That being the words of the term "knowingly and

Well, he was charged with that --

21

several counts of knowingly and willfully misapplying

22

Federal money, was he not?

MR. OREN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

That was the language used.

25

MR. OREN:

That -- that is correct.

1

QUESTION:

And your argument, as I understand

2

it, is that "knowingly and willfully" somehow incorporates

3

a fraudulent intent, even though the statute otherwise, in

4

describing not merely the -- in describing not the --

5

the -- the offense of misapplication, but a different kind

6

of offense, of obtaining, refers expressly to fraud as one

7

forbidden means of obtaining property.

8

that the nub of your problem?

9

And -- and isn't

The statute refers to fraud elsewhere, but you

10

want us to import the concept of fraud into -- into a term

11

which, on its face, has no apparent reference to fraud?

12

MR. OREN:

I am using the term "fraudulent

13

intent," I believe, as synonymous with or indicative of

14

what would be called specific intent of the common law or

15

illegal purpose.

16

very descriptive of specific intent when it comes to the

17

use or misuse of money.

18

fraudulent intent is specific intent or illegal purpose,

19

and that that is in fact an element of the offense of

20

misapplication of funds.

21

I think fraudulent intent is actually

QUESTION:

So what I am suggesting is that

Well, leaving aside whether you are

22

entitled to or not, didn't you get -- didn't the Seventh

23

Circuit take the position that the government would have

24

to prove -- under the -- the concept of "willfully," that

25

the government would have to prove that the misapplication

MR. OREN:

estimation, issued an opinion which was slightly

confusing.

Because, in one part, they did refer to the

Yet, on the other hand, they

10

knowingly and willfully misapplying funds did not include

11

12

QUESTION:

Yeah, but fraudulent intent, as we

13

normally use the term, is something different from an

14

intent to misuse property with knowledge that the misuse

is in fact forbidden by a Federal statute.

they inconsistent?

Those are two

misrepresentation of fact to someone as a means of getting

23

MR. OREN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

distinct from committing an act, whatever the act may be,

1

with the knowledge that there is a statute that forbids

2

the act.

3

distinction, certainly, inherent in the Seventh Circuit

4

opinion.

5

isn't a perfectly valid one.

6

MR. OREN:

And it seems to me that that's the -- that's the

And I don't see why it's a distinction that

I would -- I -- I guess, rely on the

7

Morissette case, where the -- this Court held that a

8

knowing conversion of government property included a

9

criminal intent, which would require the government to

10

show that the defendant, Morissette, had knowledge of all

11

the facts, which would have made his conduct a conversion.

12

And I do not believe that that holding is exactly what was

13

being stated by the Seventh Circuit.

14

QUESTION:

It seems to me that -- it seems to me

15

the equivalent of that in the current context would be

16

knowing all the facts that renders the -- the action a

17

misapplication.

18

of what went on in Morissette?

Wouldn't that be the precise equivalent

19

MR. OREN:

Yes.

20

QUESTION:

And -- and do you think the -- do you

21

think the holding here did not require him to know all of

22

the facts that -- that rendered this a misapplication?

23

Unless I'm mistaken, you're -- you're demanding that he

24

know more than the facts that rendered a misapplication.

25

You're demanding that he not only knew all those facts,

1

but that he also had some -- what should I say -- criminal

2

motive in the misapplication.

3

we're fighting about.

4

speaks to that at all.

5

MR. OREN:

And I thought that's what

And I don't see that Morissette

I believe that Morissette speaks to

6

this issue in this way.

Morissette referred to a

7

species -- or it referred to every stealing being a

8

conversion, yet not every conversion being a stealing.

9

What Morissette, I believe, was doing was distinguishing

10

between the tort of conversion as opposed to a criminal

11

conversion.

12

referred to a type of conversion which could occur when

13

the property first came into possession of the defendant

14

in a lawful manner, but was later misused.
And I believe that that type of conversion, that

15
16

species of conversion, is exactly what misapplication is.

17
18

And in -- in -- again, in Morissette, they

QUESTION:

Well, Mor -- Morissette was a statute

which didn't contain any requirement of intent, wasn't it?
MR. OREN:

19

I believe that it stated the

20

modifying term of "knowing conversion" in -- in the

21

statute.

22

was an element of tent -- of intent present.

23

To that extent, it -- it did indicate that there

The words of Morissette are -- are

24

these:

A knowing conversion requires more than knowledge

25

that the defendant was taking property into his

possession.

2

though not necessarily of the law, that made the taking a

3

conversion.

4

He must have had knowledge of the facts,

Now, if you apply that same text to the present

5

case, I think you'd say -- you'd say, knowing

6

misapplication requires more than knowledge that he was

7

applying the property; he must have had knowledge of the

8

facts, though not necessarily the law that made the

9

application a misapplication.

10

And -- and there's no

quarrel that that's properly charged, is there?
MR. OREN:

11

No.

That -- I -- I believe that

12

would be a proper statement as to the offense of

13

misapplication.

14

suggest anything more than that in my use of the term

15

"fraudulent intent."

And I don't believe that I was trying to

QUESTION:

16

But the -- the Seventh Circuit would

17

give you even more than Justice Scalia just suggested that

18

you were entitled to.

19

you would -- you would be entitled to an instruction that

20

the government had to prove that you knew you were

21

22

So you're getting more, in fact, than -- than -- on your

23

-- on your own theory, Morissette would give you.

24
25

MR. OREN:

Under the Seventh Circuit opinion,

I really do not know how to answer

that.

I did not read the

the Seventh Circuit

opinion in that -- in that manner.
QUESTION:

What do you do with the -- the

4

1097(d), which states, in so many words, that there must

5

be an intent to defraud the United States, with intent to

6

defraud the United States?

7

section, in (d), is omitted from (a).

8

and it's not in (a), wouldn't one infer that Congress

9

didn't mean it to be read into (a)?

10

MR. OREN:

That very language in the same
So if it's in (d)

I believe that, first of all, they're

11

talking about two separate types of actions in (a) and

12

in - - and in (d) .

13

they're talking about destroying or concealing property

14

with fraudulent intent.

15

would not be -- destroying and concealing property would

16

not ordinarily have a criminal consequence.

QUESTION:

I think the -- and in subsection (d),

In those words, in normal usage,

Didn't you win this?

I mean, I --

18

I'm trying to put your argument in a way that, to me, was

19

the strongest.

20

-- but there seem to be two parts.

21

22

government is going to show that your client knew that

23

what he was doing was unlawful.

And maybe you don't mean it this way.

But

One, in the

Didn't you win that part?

24

MR. OREN:

I believe perhaps we did, yes.

25

QUESTION:

All right.

So the government would

have to show, whatever your client did, he knew it was

2

unlawful, as far as the lower opinion goes.

3

Then there seemed to be a second part, what you're calling

fraudulent intent, which doesn't have to do with the first

All right.

Now, in reading the opinion, but not your brief,

7

I thought they were -- the words "fraudulent intent"

MR. OREN:

Yes.

If you're not, if you're talking about specific intent to

don't see that it's here.

7

MR. OREN:

Right.

I believe I was using the

term "fraudulent intent" to refer to specific intent and

illegal purpose.

As that relates to this indictment, I do

10

not believe that the Seventh Circuit opinion would have

That's -- that's correct.

or the use of a third party, with intent to defraud.

2

That, I believe, would have made this indictment barely

3

sufficient, so that Mr. Bates would have at least known

4

the essence of the charges against him.

5

QUESTION:

Well, he knew the charge was -- was

6

that he knowingly and willfully misapplied.

If I

understand your position, he knows that the statute

willfully uses the funds for Y, and, according to the

of the law.

12

instead of X, but he knows that that is a violation of the

law.

14

He not only knows that he's using it for Y

You say that that's not enough, right?
You're saying he must, in -- in addition to

misapplying it, intend, by the misapplication, to defraud

MR. OREN:

I really did not intend for the --

MR. OREN:

It's not enough that he knows the statute tells

And

1

you say he can do that without violating this statute so

2

long as, in ignoring the command to use it for X, he was

not trying to defraud anybody.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. BLATT:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The decision below is correct, because both the

12

13

text and structure of Section 1097 compel the conclusion

14

that an intent to injure or defraud is not an element of

15

the misapplication offense.

16

QUESTION:

But would you agree with the -- with

17

the Circuit that the misuse has to be knowing, that it's

18

an exercise of control or dominion that's a violation of

19

the law?

20

MS. BLATT:

No - - I mean, yes, we disagree.

In

21

our view, the word -- all that's required is that the

22

defendant know that his use of the money is unauthorized.

23

The defendant does not also have to know the source of the

24

prohibition or that using the money in an - - in an

25

unauthorized manner was a violation of the law.

1

If the term "misapply" is not clearly

3

of -- of interpretation of "willful and knowingly" such as

MS. BLATT:

Perhaps.

I

The Court said in United States v.

Britton, in 1883, that misapplication was not a technical
10

or a word at common law; it was a word created by statute.

11

And in that case, the Court gave it a definition of

12

misapplication to one's use or the use of another of

The -- the Circuit,

10

I thought, made a pretty good -- good guess at it.

In this case, and in most cases,

No.

That wouldn't be a crime -- not

Yeah, but, Ms. Blatt, I'd -- I'd

really like to at least get a -- a few of your thoughts on

the issue that was actually brought up before us.

and if -- if no one else thinks it's even worth talking

about, I do anyway.

18

And --

Let's assume -- it seems to me it -- it's --

it's not as cut and dried as -- as you make it out.

20

You -- you have a list of words:

21

obtains by fraud, false statements or forgery.

22

midst of those words you have another word thrown in

that -- that doesn't have as much currency in -- in the

24

common law,

embezzles, steals,

And in the

interpretation -- it's called ejusdem generis -- that

2

when -- when you have a general word that's in a catalog

3

of other words, you give it the same -- the same

4

coloration that those other words bear.

5

extraordinary to me to find the word "misapplies," as you

6

interpret it, just, you know, well, I know it ought to go

in this account, but, you know, I'm going to put it --

what -- what's the difference, you know.

That seems very

I'm not -- I'm

It won't hurt the government.

I'm just

going to put it in this other account.

I know it's the

11

wrong account, but I think it's just as good, you know.

12

To find that word, as you interpret it, in the

13

middle of these other ones -- embezzles, steals, obtains

14

by fraud, false statement or forgery -- and then, you

know, to have a -- a 1-year --a 1-year imprisonment for

it's -- it's a strange word,

20

you took it without any intent of - - of keeping it or

21

anything like that, I -- I think it's -- it's very

plausible that you have to have some wrongful intent in

the misapplication, other than you just know you're

On that interpretation of the law, looking at

your statement of the question, which you thought was a

rephrasing of his statement, why wouldn't you read the

statute that there would not only have to be knowledge

that your conduct was injuring the government, but that

13

you would have to want to injure the government; i.e.,

you'd have to have a specific intent to injure the

government before you would be guilty under such

government, because these students are ultimately going to

MS. BLATT:

Well, the distinction, again -- and

5

I think the words "knowingly and willfully" would take

6

care of that and you wouldn't, in any event, need to read

7

intent to defraud into the statute -- but the issue would

8

turn on whether the act is voluntary and knowing or if,

9

for some reason, it was beyond the defendant's control.

10

And -- but that would be the -- the guiding principles.
And if a defendant is intentionally spending

12

this money that's not theirs and that's not earned until

13

the student finishes the term, and doesn't pay the refund

But -- but -- but, again, I mean, the issue is

whether an intent to defraud or injure would be required,
