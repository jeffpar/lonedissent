ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR A. DELANO, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DELANO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case the prosecution was entitled to use

12

codefendant Bell's confession to prove Bell's guilt and

13

nothing more.

14

that completely and fairly accomplished this purpose.

15

his confession, Bell admitted both hitting and beating

16

Stacey Wiliams.

17

Bell's confession contained two admissions
In

The remaining portion of Bell's confession,

18

which focused exclusively on establishing the role of and

19

the identity of Bell's alleged accomplices, served no

20

legitimate purpose.

21

confession were nothing more than unreliable hearsay.

22

remaining portions of Bell's confession should not have

23

been admitted, because they created for petitioner a

24

totally unnecessary risk of prejudice for petitioner.

The

this case did not, in the words of the trial judge,

2

sanitize Bell's confession.

3

the jury's attention to the fact that a name had been

4

omitted.

The words, if anything, drew

They in a sense acted as a red flag to the jury.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Delano, do you take the view that

6

if this had been redacted a little differently, so that it

7

didn't show deletion and so that it said, for example, who

8

was in the group that beat Stacey -- if it just said, me

9

and a few other guys, for example, that would be okay?
MR. DELANO:

10
11

Honor.
QUESTION:

12

13

You don't think there's any way this

could have been redacted that would satisfy you.

14
15

I do not take that position, Your

MR. DELANO:

Oh, I disagree.

It could have been

redacted --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. DELANO:

What do you disagree with?
I disagree that it could have been

18

redacted to allow in the simple statement that I hit and I

19

struck the victim.
QUESTION:

20
21

MR. DELANO:

I don't believe that is necessary,

Your Honor.

24
25

But you don't think it could be

redacted to say, me and a few other guys.

22

23

That is the only part --

QUESTION:
necessary.

Well, I'm not asking whether it's

I'm asking whether it can be permitted

MR. DELANO:

3

QUESTION:

It should not be --- and it looks to me like that

4

doesn't point to anybody, if you say, me and a few other

5

guys.
MR. DELANO:

It does not point to a specific

person.

QUESTION:

MR. DELANO:
QUESTION:

10

No.
What it does -And the evidence in this case showed

11

there was quite a gang of men who were involved, somehow,

12

or who at least confronted Stacey at one point.

13

MR. DELANO:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. DELANO:

16

In this case it would not -Only two were charged.
In this case, Justice O'Connor, it

would not have been extremely prejudicial.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. DELANO:

No.
But the point I'm trying to make

19

is, that evidence served no legitimate purpose.

20

served no legitimate purpose, it should not have been

21

admitted.
QUESTION:

22

23

25

Since it

What evidence served no legitimate

purpose?
MR. DELANO:

That several other witnesses

were -- several other persons were involved.

In other

words, there's no reason that Bell's confession needed to

2

include that information.

dispute at the trial.

4

QUESTION:

That information was not in

Well, don't

you think it would

5

unduly favor your client if all they introduce is a

6

statement that, you know, I beat him up, so it looks as

7

though there wasn't a crowd of people, and the jury looks

8

at your client, or at the other defendant and says, gee, I

9

guess he did it, and looks at your client and says,

10

according to this fellow there was nobody else there.

11

Does the court have to let it in on that basis?
MR. DELANO:

12

Justice Scalia, my position would

3

have to be that it is unnecessary.

4

for -- solely for the purpose of putting the statement in

5

context --

7

QUESTION:

If it were admitted

Mr. Delano, why must it -- must your

position --

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

QUESTION:

-- why do you put this in terms of

20

has to be?

I thought you were emphasizing that when the

21

transcript -- that when what the jury sees says, delete,

22

blank space, that that juts out.

23

whether you're wrong about the other of a -- something

24

that shows delete, blank, and something that says, and a

25

couple of other guys?

Isn't there a difference

MR. DELANO:

1

2

Under the facts of this case,

Justice Ginsburg, it doesn't make a difference.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. DELANO:

If the --

It doesn't, you say?
It's not a significant difference,

5

no.

6

thrust of my argument is the use of the term, deleted and

7

deletion, which drew the attention --

Under the facts of this case I believe that the

QUESTION:

8

9

But you said a moment ago that if

some -- the -- it wasn't necessary for the statement.

10

MR. DELANO:

11

QUESTION:

It is not.
And why does that figure into the

12

Bruton-Marsh calculus?

13

analyzing whether the evidence was "necessary" for the

14

prosecution.

15

MR. DELANO:

I don't recall those cases first

Under Bruton and Marsh the

16

attention seems to be focused towards the end of the

17

process in terms of using a limiting instruction to --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

There was no analysis at all of

necessity.
MR. DELANO:

There is -- in those particular

21

cases there is no analysis of necessity, that is correct,

22

Your Honor.

23

QUESTION:

So why do you bring it up here?

24

you asking us to extend Bruton?

MR. DELANO:

No, I'm not asking -- I'm trying to

1

put it in a context that's -- that would show that

2

although in this case it may not be necessary for the

3

resolution of this case, because the thrust of my argument

4

is the use of the term deleted and deletion, that the use

5

of what this -- the respondent refers to as neutral

6

pronouns is very misleading.

7
8

There are -- for example, in this case had there
been no other witnesses and we were simply looking at
Bell's statement, and Bell said that I hit the victim, but

10

he beat the victim, he dropped the victim on his head, on

11

its face that statement is neutral, but in that context

12

the prosecution is unnecessarily benefiting from a

13

statement that they should not receive any benefit.

14

QUESTION:

Well, why do you say, unnecessarily?

15

I mean, ordinarily evidence is admissible, and you know,

16

you have to show some reason why it isn't.

17

sounds like relevant evidence.

18

MR. DELANO:

This certainly

It's unnecessary because it serves

1

really no legitimate purpose.

20

QUESTION:

It --

Well, but where do you get that

21

analysis from?

22

come out of Marsh, and yet that is the basis on which the

23

Maryland Court of Appeals decided this case.

24
25

It doesn't come out of Bruton, it doesn't

MR. DELANO:

As I understand -- the reason for

my position is that the parts that are properly admitted

are admitted because they incriminate the maker of the

2

statement.

3

serve no purpose other than to perhaps put the statement

4

in some sort of a context.

5

dispute in this case, they seem to me to be superfluous.

The other parts of the statement that are --

Since context is not in

6

QUESTION:

Well, but you can't make it --

7

QUESTION:

Let me ask you something else.

8

Bell's statement strikes me as maybe a declaration against

9

Bell's penal interest.

10

MR. DELANO:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

Is that possible?
Only a limited --

And admissible as a result on that

basis.
MR. DELANO:

Your Honor's opinion in Williamson

14

with a declaration of penal interest was very careful to

15

limit it strictly to declarations against the interest of

16

the party making the statement.

17

admitted, I hit the victim, I beat the victim, it is a

18

declaration against interest.

19

declaration against interest.

20

To the extent that he

Beyond that, it is not a

As in Williamson, I believe Justice Ginsburg in

21

her concurring opinion was -- pointed out the confusion

22

that exists where a declaration of interest is really not

23

a declaration against interest, and I think that's what we

24

have in this situation.

25

We only have a very small portion of Bell's

1

confession that actually deals with his involvement.
QUESTION:

2

Well, certainly some of it does, and

3

I would assume, at least to that extent, it's admissible

4

on that basis.

5

MR. DELANO:

That is correct.

I have no quarrel

6

with the parts that are incriminating only to Bell.

7

bulk of the statement, however, is focused on establishing

8

the role of the other participants.

9

that evidence.

There is no need for

It allowed that evidence to be used for

10

one purpose and one purpose only, to incriminate

11

petitioner.
QUESTION:

12

The

I would like to go back to the very

13

first question that Justice O'Connor had, because I want

14

to be clear about your answer, and I'm not sure I

15

understood it.

16

The statement is altered so that it says, who

17

was in the group that beat Stacey, and the redacted

18

statement does not use the word delete, deleted, it does

19

not have wite-out, it just says, me and a few other guys.

20

Should that be admitted by the trial judge, and if not,

21

why not?

22

MR. DELANO:

In -- my position is, it should not

23

be admitted by the trial judge.

24

case, admitted by the trial judge, it would perhaps be

25

harmless error in light of the other evidence presented at

If it is, as in this

trial.
QUESTION:

But does the admission of the

3

statement, as I have described it, violate the

4

Confrontation Clause?

5

MR. DELANO:

The admission does,

in my opinion,

6

violate the Confrontation Clause because it incriminates

7

other persons.

8

person who made the statement.

9

It does not strictly incriminate the

QUESTION:

But the test is not whether it

10

incriminates other persons.

11

inevitable inference that inculpates the nonconfessing

12

codefendant.

13

MR. DELANO:

14

QUESTION:

It's whether there's an

In -Not other persons.

There are no

15

other persons here before us who are making that argument.

16

We're not concerned about them.

17

codefendant, aren't we?

18

MR. DELANO:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

We're concerned about the

Yes, Your Honor.
That's the only one.

So I don't

understand your answer.
MR. DELANO:

My answer is that the substantial

22

risk of prejudice arose from the use of the terms, deleted

23

and deletion.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. DELANO:

Prejudice to whom?
Prejudice to the petitioner.

The

1

2

use of the terms deleted and deletion.
QUESTION:

Okay, and you agree that the risk of

3

prejudice is a world apart, a world of difference,

4

depending upon whether you use the word deleted or whether

5

you use a generic term like, me and some other guys.

6

There's a big difference, isn't there?

7

MR. DELANO:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. DELANO:

Absolutely, Your Honor.
Okay.
In this case, I think common

10

experience, there's no other reason for the use of the

11

term, deleted, other than to point to the other defendant.

12

13

QUESTION:

Why is that?

I must say, I don't

understand why there's a world of difference.

14

MR. DELANO:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DELANO:

Well, Your Honor -Don't these other guys have names?
The common experience, I think, of

17

most people today is that whenever there's -- as on

18

television, there's the blip that censors a word.

19

Immediately you focus in on the blip.

20

think, what was omitted.

21

there may be five or six possible words that were omitted,

22

but in this case --

QUESTION:

You immediately

In this case -- in that case

But don't you -- if you're talking

24

about redacting it to, instead of putting in the blip

this the actual statement we're talking about?
MR. DELANO:

This -- in the statement, there

were wited-out spaces --

QUESTION:

5

MR. DELANO:

and then the other information.

7

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- and then comma, wited out spaces

Well, no one suggests that instead of

8

witing them out you could put in, bracket, and some other

9

guys, close bracket.

10

MR. DELANO:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DELANO:

13

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
You don't know of any redactions -No, I do not.
I mean, redactions -- that's not an

14

option, so you either use the statement blanking out

15

stuff, or you don't use the statement.

16

the statement with brackets.

You can't recreate

QUESTION:

No, there's a third option that

That is correct.

21

Justice O'Connor questioned.

The statement as we have it

22

is me, deleted, deleted, and a few other guys.

23

question put to you was, suppose it just said, me and a

24

few other guys, without showing any deletion, so that's a

25

third option.

MR. DELANO:

I do not want to have the Court left with the

impression that my case rises or falls on the several

5

the use, deleted and deletion.

6

The extreme prejudice in this case comes from

In context, several other guys is consistent

7

with other testimony at trial.

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Was Marsh different in that respect?

Did Marsh have the delete, wite-out -MR. DELANO:

Marsh -- in Marsh the -- from the

11

reading of the statement itself you would have no idea of

12

the -- even the existence of another person, so it is

13

quite different from this.

14

This case is not that much different from Bruton

15

in that it -- the word deleted is not that much different

16

from the use of a person's actual name, and again focusing

17

on the use of deleted and several other witnesses, I think

18

the juxtaposition of those terms aggravates the situation,

19

because had it been redacted to just say, several other

20

witnesses, the jury's attention would not have been drawn

21

to the fact that names were omitted.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, what do you say the jury would

likely infer from the word deleted?
MR. DELANO:

I think the jury would be left with

no other conclusion than that it was petitioner's name and

Now, which deleted referred to petitioner

1

Tank's name.

2

and which deleted referred to Tank is some -- a matter

3

that they could speculate on.

4

QUESTION:

5

And why is that?

Why do you say the

jury would most likely have reached that conclusion?
MR. DELANO:

6

If -- it calls to the jury's

7

attention that a name has been removed.

8

this trial,

In the context of

there's no need to remove any other name,

other than the defendant's name.
QUESTION:

10

Well, but certainly there was

11

evidence that other people, other than those who were

12

indicted, had participated, was there not?

13
14

MR. DELANO:

delete the names of those other persons.

15
16

Correct, but there was no reason to

QUESTION:

The only name --

Well, but the jury doesn't know that.

The jury isn't apprised of the Bruton rule.

17

MR. DELANO:

The jury I think, Mr. Justice

18

Rehnquist,

1

common usage of blipping on television -- it's the same as

20

when you receive -- or, at least, when I receive a letter

21

and something is blacked out on a letter.

22

is drawn immediately to the blacked-out portion of the

23

letter, and you try to figure out what is there.

24

the problem we have here.

25

is aware of common usage of the word deleted,

QUESTION:

But here,

1

try to figure out what is there, they could have come to

2

not just one but it seems to me several conclusions.

3

could have referred to any one of the people whom

4

testimony indicated had participated in this thing, some

5

of whom were not the codefendant.

6

MR. DELANO:

The only testimony that referred to

7

specific -- there were two witnesses in this case, and

8

both only identified -- there were only two names ever

9

used at trial, other than the -- Bell, the name of

10

petitioner, and the name of Tank.

11

mentioned by any other witnesses.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

It

No other names were

But wasn't there testimony that other

people, although perhaps not by name, had participated?
MR. DELANO:

There was other testimony that

15

several other witnesses were involved, that is correct.

16

But the jury, I believe, with the term deleted would be

17

left to draw no other conclusion than, why put this term

18

in here if we're not trying to keep something from us.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Delano, would you tell us what

20

you think the test is for determining a Bruton violation

21

in these circumstances?

22

As I understand it, the court below applied a

23

test to the effect that a Bruton violation occurs when a

24

codefendant's confession, either facially or by compelling

I don't believe

Have we adopted a test here?

I mean,

11

what do you rely on as pointing us to the proper test to

12

be used?

13

MR. DELANO:

The test that the court has thus

14

far used is the language whether it creates a substantial

15

risk of prejudice to the other defendant.

16
17

QUESTION:

I believe --

And you think that's not as strict as

compelling and inevitable inference.

18

MR. DELANO:

Clearly not.

The Court of Special

19

Appeals adopted what I would consider the proper test,

20

which is the, paraphrasing the test that the Court used in

21

Bruton, and referred to that there existed in this case a

22

substantial risk that the jury would be forced to the

23

conclusion that deleted and deletion referred to

24

petitioner, and I think that is the test that should be

25

used.

It was one of the many options.

Certainly, no one asked for the option, me, and then

QUESTION:

No, but isn't the juror's reasonable

reaction, on hearing that, to ask the question, why are

12

they placing this word deletion in place of whatever it

13

was he spoke, and isn't the likely answer to that

question, because it refers to this other guy in the other

MS. SHEPARD:

I disagree, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

12

I mean, I think your inference isn't as generous as it has

to be, but what if the deletion in the one statement that

we're going back to made it read in answer, me and a few

Is that less likely that the jury would draw the
inference that the petitioner was one of the people?

QUESTION:

20

MS. SHEPARD:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I think that would exalt form over

Honor, also a possibility, certainly, whether the

2

confession comes in at all, but certainly we should

3

respect the desire to include confessions in trials, and

4

we should respect the importance of joint trials.

5

Beyond that, what a trial court may use in

6

determining how best to redact is both matters of the

7

practicality of the redaction, matters of the substantive

8

communication, does it so distort the meaning.

9

A court may also take into account the interests

10

of the defendant, the interests of the codefendant, the

11

interest of the State, and in any given confession and in

12

any given statement, that balance may result in one form

13

of redaction or another.

14

QUESTION:

Ms. Shepard, one problem with leaving

15

it all up to the discretion of the trial judge is, I've

16

given you the response of one judge, nigh irresistible

inference.

necessary inference.

21

disparity if you just say, well, it's up to the trial

22

judge, and given that range, that one would say, perfectly

23

okay to have blanks, and the other one says the jury is

going to make that inference, I know they are, so I'm

going to keep it from them.

MS. SHEPARD:

1

I think I understand your

2

question.

3

that is, the ultimate rule and the ultimate goal.

4

is, the responsibility here is to make sure that a

5

statement or a confession that comes in does not directly

6

or by compelling or inevitable inference identify the

7

defendant.

8

9

I'm not sure, beyond giving the trial courts,

It is possible the trial courts might have a
different judgment in a particular statement, but that is

10

almost impossible to anticipate or correct, and the

11

judgment may change, depending on the nature of the

12

statement, too.

13

That

I believe it might -- it would not be possible

14

to give more firm guidance than simply making sure that at

15

the end when a confession is admitted it does not, in

16

fact, expressly incriminate or inculpate --

17

QUESTION:

Well, you certainly could adopt a

18

rule saying, in redacting we're not going to use the fill-

19

in- the-blank form of redaction.

20

enough, wouldn't it?

21

MS. SHEPARD:

That would be simple

It would, Your Honor, but it would

not accomplish the purposes of the Sixth Amendment,

necessarily, that is, and again --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY W. McLEESE, III

5

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

6

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

7
8

MR. McLEESE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Richardson, the Court rejected a

10

Confrontation Clause challenge to one category of redacted

11

confession, those which make no mention at all of the

12

existence of the complaining defendant.

13

Our submission in the present case is that the

14

Court should reach the same conclusion as to a second

15

category of redacted confession, those which do not name

16

or describe the complaining defendant.

17

do not vividly and facially incriminate the complaining

18

defendant, and thus are quite different from the

1

confession at issue in Bruton.

Such confessions

In addition, the costs of expanding Bruton --

about the fill-in-the-blank sort of approach here for

To answer that question --

Why don't we just eliminate that?

1

MR. McLEESE:

Well, there would be costs to that

2

if what you mean is a manner of redaction that would not

3

be apparent to the jury at all, so the jury would not know

4

that there had been any redaction at all.

5

QUESTION:

To the extent that it's possible you

6

avoid fill-in-the-blanks.

7

easily could have redacted this one so that you didn't

8

leave it deletion, deletion, with an obvious fill-in-the-

9

blank sort of effect.

10

MR. McLEESE:

It was sure possible here.

You

One could have deleted -- one

11

could have redacted this confession so that you didn't

12

have the obvious blanks.

13

impossible, while still using the signed confession, to

14

redact it in a way so that it would not have been apparent

15

to the jury that there had been some kind of redaction

16

that took place.

17

I think it would have been

But to use this case as an example, I don't

18

think that the fact that the redaction was achieved here

19

by using deletion, something that was not the subject of

20

an objection, sufficiently or significantly increased the

21

risks that the jury would infer that Bell named

22

petitioner.

23

There were a number of deletions.

There were a

24

number of names that were deleted, so the jury would not

inclined to disregard its instructions not to do that, it

QUESTION:

The jury, had it

Well, it was the -- Bell and Tank I

think is all that we're talking about.
MR. McLEESE:

I don't think the jury here, had

10

it been inclined to speculate, would have had any reason

11

to speculate that the names in Bell's confession happened

12

to map on to Bell and Tank as opposed to other names in

13

this group.

14

QUESTION:

Except there would have been no

15

reason to delete the names of third parties who were not

16

involved in the courtroom, right?

17

MR. McLEESE:

Tank was not involved in this

18

courtroom, either, and the jury, again had it been

19

inclined to speculate and disregard instructions, would

20

have had no reason to surmise that -- had no reason to

21

think that Tank's name would need to be deleted.

22

I think if the jury had been speculating it

23

would have been speculating only that whoever Bell named,

24

there must be some rule that says that all those names

25

don't come in, and the jury would have had no reason to

1

guess that among the people Bell named was petitioner.

2

There would have been -- on the facts of this

3

case, that deletion would not have been a red flag that

4

would have taken the jury anywhere even if the jury had

5

been inclined to try to follow that up.

6

QUESTION:

They had --

If we find that there's a powerful,

7

compelling inference that defendant is a person named in

8

the confession, disagreeing with your analysis, and if we

9

were writing on a clean slate, no Bruton, would there be

10

any way to admit this statement?

11

MR. McLEESE:

I think that -- I don't think that

12

even with a slate that includes Bruton the conclusion you

13

describe would dictate an unfavorable answer for the State

14

here, and what I mean by that is the following.

15

I think that Richardson, for example, makes

16

clear that this area does not turn on the mere, even

17

certainty that the jury will end up through a chain of

18

inference reaching a conclusion that evidence is

19

incriminating but must be set aside.

20

What Richardson says is, even where, through a

21

chain of inference, the jury may get to that point, we can

22

trust juries, as we trust them to set aside other things,

23

many other things, to set that aside, that Bruton is a

24

very narrow exception to that rule that arises in

25

circumstances where as a self-contained unit the

confession comes in in a form that says this person

2

committed the offense with me, so it's not -- I don't

3

think that even if one were to conclude that the inference

is one that the jury would have drawn in a particular case

eventually, had it sat down and done everything, I don't

think that supports the conclusion there was a Bruton

violation.

1

a different view on separating sentencing from guilt just

2

because of the obvious risk of prejudice in that very

3

situation, so you sort of have a general consensus that

4

that case, maybe there was no constitutional violation,

5

but there was obvious unfairness there.
MR. McLEESE:

6

But the relevant inquiry here is

7

whether the risk of jury inability to set aside

incriminating evidence is a constitutional violation, and
what Spencer v. Texas said, whatever jurisdiction -QUESTION:

codefendant it would be a blatant constitutional

violation.

You would agree with that?

14

MR. McLEESE:

15

The other answer to your question, Justice

I do agree with that.

Scalia, is Harris v. New York, where statements that are

17

taken illegally, in violation of Miranda, are admitted to

The rule that we --

All right.

So what is the rule, in

5

your opinion, about when a blank separated by commas or

6

some other pictorial depiction in a written confession is

7

equivalent to the red-eyed man, or red-haired man with the

8

limp?

9

What's the -- how would you decide that one?
MR. McLEESE:

The rule we propose is limited to

10

confessions which do not contain additional descriptive

11

information of the kind that you suggest.
QUESTION:

12

Why, in fact -- I think one argument

13

is that a blank separated by commas in the circumstance is

14

quite close to a particular description because it sets

15

the jury to thinking, and they see blank, blank, and some

other guys, and they know who that is just as if it said,

Vivid and obvious, and if not that,

if we accepted their view, are there many, many retrials

that would be necessary throughout the country?

That is to say, if this interpretation of the

Constitution of the United States is -- in other words,

9

has it been a habit of prosecutors simply to redact

MR. McLEESE:

I think that that is a widely --

12

redaction that would be apparent to the jury, perhaps, but

13

that deletes the names, is a relatively common practice in

14

the State and Federal system.

MR. DELANO:

The officer -- as in this case, the

officer who took the statement.

testified as to what was in the statement, and he's the

one who offered the statement into evidence.

He's the one who

when we get into this record and so forth we'll find that

12

you didn't -- there's no one suggesting that the way to do

13

this is to simply read the confession and leave the names

out?

MR. DELANO:

QUESTION:

17
18

That is correct, Your Honor.
How are we supposed to deal with

that, that this alternative wasn't presented to the judge?
MR. DELANO:

Under Maryland evidentiary law the

19

Court of Special Appeals and the Court of Appeals were of

20

the mind that this issue had been preserved and again, the

21

issue had not been presented by respondent in any form of

22

a cross-petition, so I don't believe that that's necessary

23

for the Court to reach that issue.

reached by the Maryland courts and decided that this was

preserved as far as Maryland evidentiary law was

QUESTION:

2

You're telling us that when we go to

3

the objection what we will find is something that says in

4

so many words the confession ought to be kept out because

5

this is not good enough under Bruton, something like that,

6

is that what --

7

MR. DELANO:

The objection was entirely under

8

Bruton.

Richardson was not mentioned, and at the end -- I

9

may be paraphrasing slightly, but the language was that

10

this clearly strengthens the case that the redactions are

11

not sufficient, but it still, under Bruton,

the petitioner, and it strengthens the case against

petitioner.

QUESTION:

I'll tell you how to do it right.

MR. DELANO:

That is correct.

The counsel,

17

defense counsel did not suggest an alternative, but I

18

don't believe the defense counsel had that actual

19

responsibility under Maryland law.
And without trying to lessen the significance of

20
21

the deletions, because I agree entirely with the Court

22

that that is the most damaging part in this case,

23

point out that the way that the deletions were done in

this case,

juxtaposition to the term,

they used the term deletion and,

at trial.

guys, so we're not here strictly with a case of deletion.

We're here with a case of deletion plus several other
