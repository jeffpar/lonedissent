ORAL ARGUMENT OF KRISTEN K. WAGGONER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

12

MS. WAGGONER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The First Amendment prohibits the

13

government from forcing people to express

14

messages that their violate religious

15

convictions.

16

Phillips to do just that, ordering him to

17

sketch, sculpt, and hand-paint cakes that

18

celebrate a view of marriage in violation of

19

his religious convictions.

Yet the Commission requires Mr.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can I ask you -­
What if -- what if

22

it's a -- if it's an item off the shelf?

23

is, they don't commission a cake just for them

24

but they walk into the shop, they see a lovely

25

cake, and they say we'd like to purchase it for

The Colorado law would prohibit that.

3

Would you claim that you are entitled to an

4

exception?

5

MS. WAGGONER:

Absolutely not.

The

6

compelled speech doctrine is triggered by

7

compelled speech.

8

pre-made cake, that is not compelled speech.

Mr. Phillips is happy to sell anything
in his store, including -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, didn't -­

didn't he express himself when he made it?
MS. WAGGONER:

Yes, he did express

14

himself when he made it.

15

which he expressed it is important to the

16

compelled speech doctrine and how it applies,

17

but when he -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, could I -- but

could I get the answer to the question?

22

so -- so if it -- if you agree that it's

23

speech, then why can he not refuse to sell the

24

cake that's in the window according to Justice

25

Ginsburg's hypothetical?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So -­

Official
6
1

MS. WAGGONER:

Well, in the context of

2

if it's already been placed in the stream of

3

commerce in a public accommodation setting, his

4

speech has been completed.

5

to speak through that cake with the purpose of

6

whatever it was when he created it.

7

He -- he intended

In contrast, though, when he has a

8

different purpose, and is expressing a message

9

through a cake, it would render a different

10
11

result.

It's still speech.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, didn't

12

he refuse to sell cupcakes that he sells

13

regularly to the public to some same-sex

14

couples who intended to marry?

15

MS. WAGGONER:

That allegation was

16

never involved in the complaint, the formal

17

charges, the ALJ's decision.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I thought -­

19

I'm a little bit surprised by what you're

20

saying because your brief seemed to suggest

21

differently -- that the couple was looking at

22

his already pre-designed cakes that he appears

23

to sell without any customization, and they sat

24

down with him, and he said I don't supply cakes

25

of any kind to gay couples.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

So I thought this cake was about his

2

refusal to supply a cake for any wedding

3

ceremony.

4

MS. WAGGONER:

Justice Sotomayor,

5

that's not how he responded to the couple.

The

6

couple came in and they requested a custom cake

7

for their wedding.

8

in a folder with all kinds of designs they

9

wanted to discuss and ended up purchasing a

At that point, they brought

10

rainbow-layered cake or -- or received a free

11

rainbow-layered cake, which certainly is

12

expression.

13

The order below requires Mr. Phillips

14

also to include words and symbols on his cakes.

15

It's that broad.

16

Mr. Phillips had used a Bible verse on a cake

17

in the past, he would be compelled to use that

18

Bible verse in a different context.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if, for example,

Where does it -­

20

where does it say -- I -- I thought that the

21

requirement was he supply a custom-made cake,

22

as he would to any other shopper, but that he

23

didn't have to convey somebody else's message;

24

that is, he didn't have to write anything on

25

the cake.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

MS. WAGGONER:

In Petitioners'

2

Appendix 57(a), the order is provided, and that

3

order requires him to provide anything that he

4

would provide on a cake in another setting for

5

a marriage between a man and a woman, which

6

includes words and images that he would provide

7

on -­

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, suppose we

exclude that and say let's make the assumption

10

that he -- if he makes custom-made cakes for

11

others, he must make it for this pair, but he

12

doesn't have to write anything for anybody.

13

doesn't have to write a message that he

14

disagrees with.

15

MS. WAGGONER:

He

Well, this Court has

16

recognized in Hurley as well as in other

17

decisions that artistic expression doesn't need

18

to include words and symbols to express a

19

message or to be protected speech.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, just -- just

21

one more thing, and then we'll leave this part

22

alone, so at least as far as I'm concerned.

23

Suppose the couple goes in and sees the cake in

24

the window and the cake has a biblical verse.

25

Does he have to sell that cake?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

MS. WAGGONER:

Under our theory, he

2

would need to sell that cake because he's

3

already created that cake with the message that

4

he intended for it, but we are drawing the line

5

prior to the compulsion -- there can be no

6

compulsion of speech.

7

If the Court were to choose to draw

8

that line in a different place and protect more

9

speech, there certainly is precedent for that.

10

But under the compelled speech doctrine, when

11

someone comes in and requests speech, if that

12

speech has already been created, then that

13

would be -- not be compelled.

14
15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me

how far -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's no -­

17

there's no -- there's no compulsion of speech,

18

but if he is required to sell a cake in the

19

window with the message already on it, that is

20

compelling him to associate that message with

21

the ceremony.

22

to which you objected.

23

MS. WAGGONER:

And I thought that was something

There would possibly be

24

an expressive association claim and potentially

25

a free exercise claim if he was delivering the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

cake and there was other involvement.

2

terms of the Court's application of the

3

compelled speech doctrine, the compulsion is

4

the trigger for that, but the Court could draw

5

that line at an earlier place and not force him

6

to sell that cake.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in

But your -­

Ms. -­
-- the question

10

that I started out with, I -- I wanted to

11

clarify that what you're talking about is a

12

custom-made cake.

13

obligation to sell his ordinary wares, his, as

14

you put it, already-made wares?

15

MS. WAGGONER:

You are not challenging his

Not at all.

And, in

16

fact, Mr. Phillips offered the couple anything

17

in his store, as well as offered to sell

18

additional cakes, custom cakes, that would

19

express other messages.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Going -­

Ms. Waggoner -­

It was the speech, a

At a wedding ceremony, I take it, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

speech is of the people who are marrying and

2

perhaps the officiant, but who -- who else

3

speaks at a wedding?

4

MS. WAGGONER:

The artist speaks,

5

Justice Ginsburg.

It's as much Mr. Phillips's

6

speech as it would be the couples'.

7

Hurley, the Court found a violation of the

8

compelled speech doctrine.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in

Who else then?

designs the invitation?

How about -­

Yes.
The invitation to

the wedding or the menu for the wedding dinner?
MS. WAGGONER:

Certainly, words and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

symbols would be protected speech, and the

2

question would be whether the objection is to

3

the message provided or if it's to the person.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

MS. WAGGONER:

So the jeweler?
It would depend on the

6

context as all free-speech cases depend on.

7

What is the jeweler asked to do?

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

MS. WAGGONER:

The hairstylist?
Absolutely not.

10

There's no expression or protected speech in

11

that kind of context, but what it would -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why is there no speech

in -- in creating a wonderful hairdo?
MS. WAGGONER:

Well, it may be

15

artistic, it may be creative, but what the

16

Court asks when there's -­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.

would ask -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

It's the makeup artist.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MS. WAGGONER:

The makeup artist may,

24

again, be using creativity and artistry, but

25

when this Court is looking at whether speech is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

communicating something, and is it analogous to

3

other protected -­

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

MS. WAGGONER:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I'm -­
-- forms of speech.
-- I'm quite serious,

7

actually, about this, because, you know, a

8

makeup artist, I think, might feel exactly as

9

your client does, that they're doing something

10

that's of -- of great aesthetic importance to

11

the -- to the wedding and to -- and that

12

there's a lot of skill and artistic vision that

13

goes into making a -- somebody look beautiful.

14

And why -- why wouldn't that person or the

15

hairstylist -- why wouldn't that also count?

16

MS. WAGGONER:

17

speech.

18

this case -­

19
20

Because it's not

And that's the first trigger point of

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, some people

might say that about cakes, you know?

21

MS. WAGGONER:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Some -­
But you have a -- you

23

have a view that a cake can be speech because

24

it -- it involves great skill and artistry.

25

And I guess I'm wondering, if that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

the case, you know, how do you draw a line?

2

How do you decide, oh, of course, the chef and

3

the baker are on one side, and you said, I

4

think, the florist is on that side, the chef,

5

the baker, the florist, versus the hairstylist

6

or the makeup artist?

7

I mean, where would you put a tailor,

8

a tailor who makes a wonderful suit of clothes?

9

Where does that come in?

10

MS. WAGGONER:

Your Honor, the tailor

11

is not engaged in speech, nor is the chef

12

engaged in speech but, again, this Court -­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why well, why -­

14

well -- woah.

15

but the chef is not engaged in speech?

16

The baker is engaged in speech,

MS. WAGGONER:

The -- the test that

17

this Court has used in the past to determine

18

whether speech is engaged in is to ask if it's

19

communicating something, and if whatever is

20

being communicated, the medium used is similar

21

to other mediums that this Court has protected.

predominant purpose is virtually always to be

example of some work of art, that might be

3

different because the circumstances would show

that they want this to be affiliated with

6

But explain how that becomes

7

expressive speech, that medium becomes

8

expressive speech.

MS. WAGGONER:

Certainly not all cakes

10

would be considered speech, but in the wedding

context, Mr. Phillips is painting on a blank

canvas.

words and symbols in those messages.

someone that is sketching and sculpting and

hand designing something, that is creating a

7

temporary sculpture that serves as the

8

centerpiece of what they believe to be a

Precisely.

In the

MS. WAGGONER:

I would say that in

policy, which allows the state the discretion

25

to decide what speech is offensive and what is

Mr. Phillips, which creates viewpoint

discrimination, as well as a violation of free

is not the theory that Respondents are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. NOEL J. FRANCISCO

20

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

21

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

22
23
24
25

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it -- may it please the Court:
This case raises an important issue
for a small group of individuals, namely,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

whether the state may compel business owners,

2

including professional artists, to engage in

3

speech in connection with an expressive event

4

like a marriage celebration to which they're

5

deeply opposed.

6

In those narrow circumstances, we

7

believe the Free Speech Clause provides

8

breathing space -­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How narrow is it?

10

Consider Justice Kagan's question.

11

we've gotten the answer that the florist is in

12

the same place as the cake-maker, so is the

13

person who designs the invitations and the

14

menus.

15

that would exclude the -- the makeup artist or

16

the hairstylist.

17

I mean,

I don't see a line that can be drawn

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, Your Honor,

18

that's, of course, a question that the course

19

has -- Court has to answer at the threshold of

20

every Free Speech Case.

21

being regulated something we call protected

speech?

23

the other side is that they think the question

24

doesn't even matter.

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, Your Honor,

I think that what it boils down to is that in a

9

narrow category of services that do cross the

10

threshold into protected speech -- and I do

11

think it's a relatively narrow category -- you

12

do have protection.

13

you could force the African-American sculptor

14

to sculpt a cross for the Klan service just

15

because he'd do it for religious services.

For example, I don't think

could the baker put a sign in his window, we do

22

custom-made wedding cakes for gay weddings, but

23

most cakes -­

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And you would not -­
-- would not cross

that threshold.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- consider that an

affront to the gay community?

4

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, Your Honor,

5

I -- I agree that there are dignity interests

6

at stake here, and I would not minimize the

7

dignity interests to Mr. Craig and Mr. Mullins

8

one bit, but there are dignity interests on the

9

other side here too.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, sometimes

11

it's not just dignity.

A couple of the

12

briefs -- one of the amici briefs pointed out

13

that most military bases are in isolated areas

14

far from cities and that they're in areas where

15

the general population, service population, is

16

of one religion or close to one religious

17

belief.

18

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Uh-huh.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So where there

20

might be two cake bakers.

They name a couple

21

of military bases like that.

22

or one photographer.

23

resources.

Or two florists

Very small number of

24

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And in those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

situations, they posit, and I don't think

2

probably wrongly, that it may come to pass

3

where the two cake bakers will claim the same

4

abstention here.

5

military men and women who are of the same sex

6

who want to get married in that town because

7

that's where all their friends are, because the

8

base is there?

So how do we protect the

9

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right?

11

How do

we protect those people?

12

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And, Your Honor, I

13

think that is precisely a situation where the

14

state would be able to satisfy heightened

15

scrutiny because their interests in providing

16

access to goods and services would be narrowly

17

tailored.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -- but isn't

19

that -- isn't that the same for everybody?

20

Meaning, look, we live in a society with

21

competing beliefs, and all of our cases have

22

always said where LGBT people have been -- you

23

know, they've been humiliated, disrespected,

24

treated uncivilly.

25

situations that -­

The briefs are filled with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- the gay couple

3

who was left on the side of the highway on a

4

rainy night, people who have been denied

5

medical treatment or whose children have been

6

denied medical treatment because the doctor

7

didn't believe in same-sex parenthood, et

8

cetera.

9

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Mm-hmm.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We've always said

11

in our public accommodations law we can't

12

change your private beliefs, we can't compel

13

you to like these people, we can't compel you

14

to bring them into your home, but if you want

15

to be a part of our community, of our civic

16

community, there's certain behavior, conduct -­

17

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- you can't

19

engage in.

20

products that you sell to everyone else to

21

people simply because of their either race,

22

religion, national origin, gender, and in this

23

case sexual orientation.

24
25

And that includes not selling

So we can't legislate civility and
rudeness, but we can and have permitted it as a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

compelling state interest legislating behavior.

2

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why is not

4

selling or selling to one group as opposed to

5

another not behavior?

6

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And, Your Honor,

7

if I could respond, I think it's because here

8

we have speech involved, and this case is

9

essentially the flip side of the Hurley case.

10

In Hurley, we couldn't force a parade

11

to include a particular speaker.

12

don't think you can -­

Here, we

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That was a private

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And here, Your

parade.

15
16

Honor, we don't think you can force a speaker

17

to join the parade, because when you force a

18

speaker to both engage in speech and contribute

19

that speech to an expressive event that they

20

disagree with, you fundamentally transform the

21

nature of their message from one that they want

22

to say to one that they don't want to say.

-- if it's a -- if

it's a question of race?

There's a certain

4

irony in here because one of the things that

5

anti-discrimination in public accommodations is

6

supposed to do is to protect religion, minority

7

religions.

How about national

Right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

-- and religion?
I think pretty

3

much everything but race would fall in the same

4

category, but as this Court made clear in the

5

Bob Jones case, the IRS could withdraw

6

tax-exempt status from a school that

7

discriminated on the basis of interracial

8

marriage, but I'm not at all sure that it would

9

reach the same result if it were dealing with a

10

Catholic school that limited married student

11

housing to opposite-sex couples only.

12

I think when you get to this case, if

13

you agree with our test -- and I know that I

14

have a little bit of an uphill battle in

15

convincing some of you of that.

16

with our test, I think the heightened scrutiny

17

standard is particularly easy because they're

18

the same interests at stake as were at stake in

19

Hurley.

20

And if I could -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If you agree

General, it -- it

22

seems as though there are kind of three axes on

which people are asking you what's the line?

How do we draw the line?

25

we started with, like what about the chef and

So one axis is what

5

Speech,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- and -- and, you

know, everybody else that participates -­

6

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

A second axis is, well, why is this

9

only about gay people?

Uh-huh.

-- in a wedding?

Why isn't it about

10

race?

Why isn't it about gender?

11

about people of different religions?

12

a second axis.

13

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why isn't it
So that's

Uh-huh.

And there's a third

15

axis, which is why is it just about weddings?

16

You say ceremonies, events.

17

Is it the funeral?

18

the communion?

19

celebration?

20

What else counts?

Is it the Bar Mitzvah or

Is it the anniversary
Is it the birthday celebration?

So there are all three of these that

21

suggest like, whoa, this doesn't seem like such

22

a small thing.

23

hypothetical and then you can answer more

24

broadly.

25

And so let me just give you one

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Thank you.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

35

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Which, you know -- so

2

let me -- I'll just pick one of those.

3

like how about a -- a -- a -- a couple, a

6

and the great chef says I don't do this for

7

same-sex couples?

I could answer that question starting out with

And, of course, the concern is that we would

have caused chaos with that principle across

the board because there is no way of confining

Heritage Reporting Corporation

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, Your Honor,

4

I think that the way you do it is because none

5

of these Courts' cases has ever involved

6

requiring somebody to create speech and

7

contribute that speech to an expressive event

8

to which they are deeply opposed.

9

And if I could go back to my example,

10

when you force that African-American sculptor

11

to sculpt that cross for a Klan service, you're

12

transforming his message.

13

He may want his cross to send the

14

message of peace and harmony.

15

to combine it with that expressive event, you

16

force him to send a message of hate and

17

division.

more and more bakers began to comply.
Would the government feel vindicated
in its position that it now submits to us?
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, I

5

think in that case, the case for strict

6

scrutiny would be much stronger, because you'd

7

be able to show that your -- that the

8

application of the law is narrowly tailored to

9

the government's interests in ensuring access.

10

Here, of course, you have these

11

products that are widely available from many

12

different sources.

13

finish up, that if you were to disagree with

14

our basic principle, putting aside the line

15

about whether a cake falls on speech or

16

non-speech side of the line, you really are

17

envisioning a situation in which you could

18

force, for example, a gay opera singer to

19

perform at the Westboro Baptist Church just

20

because that opera singer would be willing to

perform at the National Cathedral.

think there's an initial question that's asked

22

in all of these cases, and it's the way that

I see

The reason I want you to continue this

10

is that many of the civil rights laws, not all

12

exceptions, like, for example, with housing, a

13

person's own room, for example.

14

And what people are trying to do with

15

exceptions is take the thing you're worried

16

about, where there are genuine, sincere

17

religious views or whatever it is, and minimize

18

the harm it does to the principle of the

19

statute while making some kind of compromise

20

for people of sincere beliefs on the other

21

side.

22

And we find that in -- in a lot of

them, but that's primarily a legislative job.

addition to the statement made, the statement

The -- the Commission had before it
the example of three complaints filed by an

individual whose creed includes the traditional

marriage, and he requested cakes that expressed

13

that point of view, and those -- there were

14

bakers who said no, we won't do that because it

is offensive.

message that is opposed to same-sex marriage.

say that there's -- there is a possibility that

that does not violate the law if there's not

to each other and celebrating that commitment

So, if Craig and Mullins had gone to a

license, they would not have been accommodated.

would say:

accommodate that either.

No, we won't accommodate that.
Well, we won't

And yet, when he goes to this bake

10

shop and he says I want a wedding cake, and the

11

baker says, no, I won't do it, in part because

12

same-sex marriage was not allowed in Colorado

13

at the time, he's created a grave wrong.

14

does that all that fit together?

MR. YARGER:

it -- it -- the decision by this bakery was it

No -­

-- of any kind, not even

when the same -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

-- that's not right,

22

Mr. Yarger.

It's a disturbing feature of your

23

brief because this case was decided on summary

24

judgment, and, therefore, you have to view the

25

facts in the light most favorable to Mr.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1
2

Phillips.
And the only thing he admitted and

3

what was said in the undisputed -- the list of

4

undisputed facts was he would not create -- he

5

was very careful to use the word "create."

6

that wrong?

7

MR. YARGER:

Is

That's not incorrect,

8

Your Honor.

What -- what he has said is that

9

all of his wedding cakes are custom-made.

And

10

so what he said is that he would have a right

11

to refuse that service to anyone whose identity

12

in his view means that the message has changed.

13

And he does not want to sell it to them.

14

It would be akin to a -­

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

And we have a history

16

of -- in the questioning by -- of Petitioners'

17

counsel, we explored the line between speech

18

and non-speech, but as I understand your

19

position, it would be the same if what was

20

involved here were words.

21

Am I wrong?

If he would put a

22

particular form of words on a wedding cake, on

23

a cake for one customer, he has to put the same

24

form of words, the same exact words, on a

25

wedding cake for any other customer, regardless

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
70
1

of the context?

2

MR. YARGER:

That's -- that's right,

3

just as he would have to sell a happy birthday

4

cake to a member of the Jewish faith or an

5

African-American couple.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, if someone came in

7

8

our wedding anniversary, and I want it to say

9

November 9, the best day in history, okay,

10

sells them a cake.

wants exactly the same words on the cake, he

says:

that?

Somebody else comes in,

MR. YARGER:

It is, Your Honor.

I

21

haven't -- I don't -- that would be a question

22

about whether there is a even-handed, genuine

23

policy applied by the baker that doesn't have

24

to do with the identity of the customer.

25

And if it has to do with a message

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71

that is apart from the identity of the

2

customer, then he can refuse that.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I -- I have a quick

11

question about the remedy.

12

Colorado ordered Mr. Phillips to provide

13

comprehensive training to his staff, and it

14

didn't order him to attend a class of the

15

government's own creation or anything like

16

that, but to provide comprehensive staff

17

training.

18

As I understand it,

Why -- why isn't that compelled speech

19

and possibly in violation of his free-exercise

20

rights?

21

staff, including his family members, that his

22

Christian beliefs are discriminatory.

23

Because presumably he has to tell his

MR. YARGER:

He -- a training

24

requirement is a common remedy that's used in

25

many civil rights cases.

He -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
72
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yeah.

2

isn't attending your training.

3

MR. YARGER:

4
5

But this

He doesn't have to say

that his -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Yarger, again, I

6

agree with you, some sort of training by an

7

outside group, but this order was ordering him

8

to provide training and presumably compelling

9

him to speak, therefore, and to speak in ways

10

that maybe offend his religion and certainly

11

compel him to speak.

12

And given that, plus the

13

discriminatory language in the -- in the

14

Commission's discussion, I just -- that

15

concerns me, and I just wonder what you have to

16

say about it.

17

MR. YARGER:

I understand, Your Honor,

18

if -- all that's required in these training

19

sessions is an understanding and a demonstrated

20

understanding of the Colorado

21

Anti-Discrimination Act.

22

It has nothing to do with a particular

23

person's belief.

It has to do with ensuring

24

that the conduct that was found discriminatory,

25

and if that conduct can be regulated consistent

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
73
1

with the First Amendment, I think that a

2

training requirement like that can be imposed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID COLE
ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS
MR. COLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
We don't doubt the sincerity of Mr.

20

Phillips's convictions.

21

argument leads to unacceptable consequences.

22

But to accept his

A bakery could refuse to sell a

23

birthday cake to a black family if it objected

24

to celebrating black lives.

25

photography studio could refuse to take

A corporate

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
75

pictures of female CEOs if it believed that a

2

woman's place is in the home.

3

And a florist could put a sign up on

4

her storefront saying we don't do gay funerals,

5

if she objected to memorializing gay people.

6

Now, both Petitioner and the United

7

States recognize that these results are

8

unacceptable with respect to race.

9

And so they suggest that you draw a

10

distinction between race discrimination and

11

sexual orientation discrimination and the

12

state's ability to protect it.

13

would be to constitutionally relegate gay and

14

lesbian people to second class status, even

15

when a state has chosen, as Colorado has done

16

here, to extend them equal treatment.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But to do that

I'm not sure

18

he provides equal services outside the context

19

of wedding to -- weddings, to gay and lesbian

20

individuals.

21

obviously is very compelling, but when the

22

Court upheld same-sex marriage in Obergefell,

23

it went out of its way to talk about the decent

24

and honorable people who may have opposing

25

views.

And the -- the racial analogy

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
76
1

And to immediately lump them in the

2

same group as people who are opposed to

3

equality in relations with respect to race, I'm

4

not sure that takes full account of that -- of

5

that concept in the Obergefell decision.

6

MR. COLE:

So -- so, Chief Justice

7

Roberts, the Court in -- in Obergefell did,

8

indeed, say that individuals are free to

9

express their disagreement through speech with

10

the notion of same-sex marriage, but it did not

11

say that businesses who make a choice to open

12

themselves to the public can then turn away

13

people because they are gay and lesbian.

14

All the baker needed to know about my

15

clients was that they were gay and lesbian.

But is there an

20

answer to that?

I was trying to get the answer

21

to that, and I -- I think that they're

22

proceeding roughly on the line that, well, all

23

that you say is true, but that doesn't mean

24

that under these laws, maybe the African

25

American, et cetera, is separate, but it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

doesn't mean that the person could be hired to

2

come to the wedding and announce to the general

3

people there, this is the most wonderful thing

4

I've ever been at.

6

Now, that's where they say they have a
right not to do that.

what you're saying.

you say in respect, if I'm right, about what

17

they say.

18

MR. COLE:

So I'd like to hear what

Yeah, thank you.

No one is

19

suggesting that the baker has to march in the

20

parade, as Mr. Francisco said here.

21

-- what the Colorado law requires is that you

22

sell a product -- when a -- when a mom goes

23

into a bakery and says make me a happy birthday

24

cake for my child, and then she takes that cake

25

home for her four-year-old son's birthday

I think in -- I think in a future case that

involved physical participation in a -- in a -­

8

in a religious ceremony that an individual

might draw -- might create new doctrine and

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that the preparer

thinks is something special.
So -- so here, is it an answer that

22

satisfies you to say, well, you see, here, of

23

course, all custom goods, all custom goods have

24

an element of expression.

25

quite the same as an artist, but an artisan can

An artisan is not

2

But where the clash is between an important

3

public policy, the policy of opening the doors

4

to everyone, including minorities, in the

5

public commercial area, well, there the speech

6

element of the artisan is not really sufficient

7

to outweigh that.

8

straightforward.

9

Now, that's pretty

And I don't know if -- how it fits

10

within the law and the so forth.

11

you're looking at the policies here, it seems

12

to me the cases do support that.

13

have to leave open the instance where the

14

speech goes farther than just preparing a

So, Justice Breyer -­
And if that's not

good, what is?
MR. COLE:

So, Justice Breyer, I think

22

the -- the -- the colloquy with my opponent

with respect to whether a cake artist is

24

different from a makeup -- makeup artist, or

25

whether a highly-sculpted cake is different

10

You do what you did in O'Brien, in

Broadcasting.

11

And what the -- what the Court has

12

done when it's expressive conduct, because

13

that's what we have here at most is expressive

14

conduct, we don't ask is it expressive from the

15

perspective of the baker or is it expressive

16

from the perspective of a -- of a -- of a

customer.

is that someone can be compelled to write

MR. COLE:

If he has written the same

words for others, and the only difference is

23

the identity of the customer, yes, so, again, a

baker could sincerely believe that saying happy

25

birthday to a black family is different from

Heritage Reporting Corporation

saying happy birthday to a white family, but we

would not say that, therefore, it's permissible

for a baker to say:

4

birthday cakes for whites

JUSTICE ALITO:

There's a -- there are

6

services, I was somewhat surprised to learn

7

this, but weddings have become so elaborate,

8

that will write custom wedding vows for you and

9

custom wedding speeches.

10

So somebody comes to one of these

11

services and says:

12

with words, but we want you to write wedding -­

13

a vow -- vows for our wedding, and the general

14

idea we want to express is that we don't

15

believe in God, we think that's a bunch of

16

nonsense, but we're going to try to live our

17

lives to make the world a better place.

18

the -- the person who's writing this is

19

religious and says:

20

creative efforts to the expression of such a

21

message.

22

You know, we're not good

I can't lend my own

MR. COLE:

What I would say, Your

principle do we use to treat it differently?
MR. COLE:

I think the principle would

have to be some amendment to Smith versus

13

Employment Division to say that even where

14

there's a generally applicable law, and even

15

where it's neutrally applied, if it has the

16

effect of compelling somebody to engage in a

17

religious ceremony that is against their deep

differently, but under current law -­

Alito's question -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, why is that

23

any different than our case?

You say it's not

24

based on identity, but the baker might well say

25

I -- I -- I despise people who adhere to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
88
1

creed -­

2

MR. COLE:

Right.

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- of the KKK.

4

That's one way of characterizing it.

5

way of characterizing it is saying I disagree

6

with the message of the KKK.

7

So too here.

Another

One could make the exact

8

analogy, I would think, that you could either

9

characterize it as I -- I don't like people of

10

a certain class or I -- or I have a religious

11

belief against this kind of union.

12
13

So how do I distinguish those cases?
I'm not sure it's quite as easy as you suggest.

14

MR. COLE:

So I -- I think -- I think,

15

Your Honor, if -- if identity discrimination is

16

involved -- and there's no question that

17

identity discrimination is involved here

18

because, again, the only thing the baker knew

19

was the identity of the people who were -­

Mr. Cole, maybe I

--

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That -- that's -­
-- I misunderstood

24

your answer to Justice Gorsuch.

Did you say

25

you could refuse to sell the identical cake

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

with the red cross?

2

MR. COLE:

If -- if he is not doing it

3

on the basis of the identity -- a protected

4

identity.

5

is not a protected class.

6

The Ku Klux Klan as an organization

So, yes, you don't -- you're -- you're

7

-- the -- the public accommodations law does

8

not say you must treat everybody; it says you

9

cannot discriminate on the basis of protected

10

categories.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but this whole

12

concept of identity is a slightly -- suppose he

says:

gay people.

15

they should have a marriage because that's

16

contrary to my beliefs.

20

MR. COLE:

MR. COLE:

Well, Justice Kennedy, this

Bob Jones University said we're

We

And this Court said that's race
That's identity-based

similarly.

11

But -- but I think one way to think

12

about this case is -- is -- is analogize it to

13

O'Brien, right?

14

that O'Brien's burning of the draft card to

15

protest the Vietnam War was expressive.

16

core political expression.

17

In O'Brien, nobody disputed

It was

But what the Court did was it didn't

18

say, well, how expressive is it?

Is it

19

artistry; is it not?

20

It said:

21

Because it's expressive conduct.

22

state's seeking to regulate conduct, then the

23

fact that it has an incidental effect on

24

Mr. O'Brien's expression is not a problem as

25

long as the state has a content-neutral reason

Is it core; is it not?

What is the state trying to do here?

for regulating that conduct.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I take Justice

Gorsuch's question and substitute for the KKK,

5

religious group that unfortunately has the same

6

beliefs as the KKK.

7

It doesn't -- then you can

MR. COLE:

JUSTICE BREYER:

they do have to sell it to them, right?
MR. COLE:

I think if the

12

discrimination is based on a -- a protected

characteristic, yes, they -- they can't say

treatment sends, right?

19

21

22

that context.

23

Piggie Park objected
To

And this

So I don't -- I just -- I don't think

24

you can carve out exceptions to generally

25

applicable rules that regulate conduct in a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
92
1

content-neutral way, as this does.

2

as Mr. -- the fact that Mr. O'Brien's conduct,

3

burning the draft card, was expressive did not

4

give him a First Amendment exemption to a

5

content-neutral prohibition on draft card

6

destruction, so the fact that Mr. Phillips

7

considers his cake-baking to be expressive

8

doesn't give him a First Amendment exemption to

9

a content-neutral regulation of public

10

And so just

accommodation sales in the retail context.

11

This Court has already said that that

12

interest in prohibiting discrimination on the

13

basis of identity in public accommodations is a

14

interest unrelated to the suppression of

15

expression, said that in Roberts versus

Jaycees, it serves compelling interests,

19

MR. COLE:

Right.

So I -- I don't

20

think they have -- they obviously don't have to

21

argue for a position that they disagree with.

22

But what they -- if they provide wills or they

23

provide landlord/tenant to a -- a straight

24

couple, then they have to provide that to a gay

25

couple.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So they

2

would -- if someone had a problem in connection

with their marriage, again, whatever it is,

5

would have to provide representative services

to someone who had a similar problem in

You're engaged

in a representation before the Court, which

3

saying in response to the answers.

4

MR. COLE:

Well, you know, if -- if

5

you -- if you treat -- if you treat -- Hurley,

6

I think, illustrates that where the state is

7

regulating only expression, no conduct at all,

8

just a banner that's in the parade, the Court

9

takes a different view, but where expressive

10

conduct is involved -- and the reason the Court

11

takes a different view makes sense because,

12

again, the -- the analysis this Court uses with

13

respect -- with respect to expressive conduct

14

is, is the state regulating the conduct for

15

some reason other than what it expresses or is

16

it regulating what it expresses?

17

And -- and when you only have

18

expression, when all that's involved is

19

expression, as was the case with the parade in

20

Hurley, that's different because there's no -­

21

there's no neutral conduct to be regulated.

22

But here what we have is the sale of a good, a

23

cake, to a -- to an individual.

24

-- to the extent it's expressive, it's

25

certainly also conduct.

That's -- that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And Colorado's interest in ensuring

2

the bakeries and tailors and -- and other

as the Chief Justice's question, would you say

that Colorado can compel a religious college

believe.

And that's what they

MR. COLE:

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

So, I think -- I think -­
So your answer is they

would be -­
MR. COLE:

I -­

JUSTICE ALITO: -- they would be

11

required to do it?

12

MR. COLE:

Well, I think under this

13

Court's doctrine in Employment Division versus

14

Smith, the question would be, is it a generally

15

applicable neutral law?

16

generally applicable neutral law, there would

17

not be a free exercise question at all.

18

And if it's a

Right?

And so -- and -- and the reason for

19

that, as Justice Scalia said in -- in

20

Employment Division versus Smith, is equally

21

applicable here.

22

Once you open this up, once you say

23

generally applicable regulations of conduct

24

have exceptions when someone raises a religious

25

objection, or in this case have objections

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
98
1

where someone raises a speech objection, you're

2

in a world in which every man is a law unto

3

himself.

4

And so the only sensible way to

5

approach this is to say if the state is

6

targeting religion, then we're going to be very

7

careful about protecting religion.

8

state is targeting the message, is targeting

9

the content of speech, then we're going to be

10
11

And if the

very careful about protecting.
But when the state is regulating

12

conduct neutrally, unrelated to expression,

13

which is what this Court has already said is

14

the case with respect to public accommodations,

15

then we can have a world in which everybody who

16

raises an objection -- otherwise we would live

17

in a society in which businesses across this

18

country could put signs up saying we serve

MS. WAGGONER:

Justice Sotomayor, in

22

the context of your question regarding the

23

Hilton, there may be a religious accommodation

24

that is made to that employee; but in the

25

context of Masterpiece Cakeshop, this -- this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
100
1

Court has found that corporations have free

2

speech rights, as well as closely family-held

3

corporations have free exercise rights.

4

And Mr. Phillips is also the speaker.

5

So they're both speaking when they're creating

6

--

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But who makes a

8

decision for the corporation?

In -- in most

9

situations -- it may be easier in a

10

closely-held corporation, it may be the

11

shareholders.

12

corporate board or it's the shareholders.

I don't know if it's the

13

Who -- who decides?

14

MS. WAGGONER:

Well, certainly I think

15

it -- again, if it's dealing with an employee,

16

the employee certainly decides what -- what

17

they're willing to express, and -­

18
19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It can't be the

employee -­

20

MS. WAGGONER:

-- and -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- speaking for

22

the corporation.

The employee can be made an

23

agent of the corporation and speak on its

24

behalf, but the employee can't choose it on

25

behalf of the corporation.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
101
1

MS. WAGGONER:

Certainly.

But if

2

we're talking about what the corporation will

3

speak, then the shareholders in an -- in a

4

small family-held corporation, the shareholders

5

would decide that.

6

at stake in this case.

7

And that's exactly what's

Mr. Phillips owns Masterpiece

8

Cakeshops.

9

cakes himself by him -­

10
11

He designs most of the wedding

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's him and his

wife, right?

12

MS. WAGGONER:

Yes, it is.

13

I have three brief points in rebuttal:

14

First of all, the bias of the

15

Commission is also evidenced in the unequal

16

treatment of the cake designers, the three

17

other cake designers who were on the squarely

18

opposite sides of this issue.

19

If -- if the Court looks at the

20

analysis that was provided by the Colorado

21

Court of Appeals, line by line they take the

22

opposite approach to Mr. Phillips that they do

23

to those who are unwilling to criticize

24

same-sex marriage -­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And they say they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
102
1

wouldn't -- that they would say no to anyone

2

who came with that request?

3

MS. WAGGONER:

No.

The Colorado Court

4

of Appeals said that they could have an

5

offensiveness policy, and they said that those

6

three cake designers were expressing their own

7

message if they had to design that cake.

8
9
10
11

In Mr. Phillips's case, they said it
wasn't his message.

It's simply compliance

with the law.
In the other case, they said that the

12

cake designers, because they served Christian

13

customers in other contexts, that that was

14

evidence it was a distinction based on the

15

message, but in Mr. Phillips's case, they ruled

16

the opposite way.

17

Professor Laycock's brief provides a

18

good analysis of that as well.

19

this case.

20

It was filed in

Second, the Compelled Speech Doctrine

21

and the Free Exercise Clause is anchored in the

22

concept of dignity and speaker autonomy.

23

in this case, dignity cuts both ways.

24

record is clear on that.

25

And

The

Demeaning Mr. Phillips's honorable and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
103
1

decent religious beliefs about marriage, when

2

he has served everyone and has a history of

3

declining all kinds of cakes unaffiliated with

4

sexual orientation because of the message, he

5

should receive protection here as well.

6

This law protects the lesbian graphic

7

designer who doesn't want to design for the

8

Westboro Baptist Church, as much as it protects

9

Mr. Phillips.

10

Lastly, political, religious, and

11

moral opinions shift.

12

Court's dedication to Compelled Speech Doctrine

13

and to free exercise should not shift.

14

We know that.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And this

Counsel, the

15

problem is that America's reaction to mixed

16

marriages and to race didn't change on its own.

17

It changed because we had public accommodation

18

laws that forced people to do things that many

19

claimed were against their expressive rights

20

and against their religious rights.

21

It's not denigrating someone by

22

saying, as I mentioned earlier, to say:

If you

23

choose to participate in our community in a

24

public way, your choice, you can choose to sell

25

cakes or not.

You can choose to sell cupcakes

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
104
1

or not, whatever it is you choose to sell, you

2

have to sell it to everyone who knocks on your

3

door, if you open your door to everyone.

4

MS. WAGGONER:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice?
You can

respond, if you'd like.
MS. WAGGONER:

Justice Sotomayor, I

8

think that the gravest offense to the First

9

Amendment would be to compel a person who

10

believes that marriage is sacred, to give voice

11

to a different view of marriage and require

12

them to celebrate that marriage.

13

Amendment -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The First

Then don't

15

participate in weddings, or create a cake that

16

is neutral, but you don't have to take and

17

offer goods to the public and then choose not

18

to sell to some because of a protected

19

characteristic.

20

anti-discrimination laws require.

21
22
23

That's what the public

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A brief last

word, Ms. Waggoner.
MS. WAGGONER:

A wedding cake

24

expresses an inherent message that is that the

25

union is a marriage and is to be celebrated,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
105
1

and that message violates Mr. Phillips's

2

religious convictions.

3

Thank you.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5
6
7

counsel.

This Court should reverse.
Thank you,

The case is submitted.
