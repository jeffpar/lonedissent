CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

4

argument today in Case 16-1432, Sveen versus

5

Melin.

6

Mr. Unikowsky.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The question before the Court today is

12

whether the application of a

13

revocation-on-divorce statute to a life

14

insurance policy purchased before the enactment

15

of that statute violates the Contracts Clause.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you just -- as

17

a preliminary matter, after the divorce but

18

before the owner of the policy died, did he pay

19

premiums?

20

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I -- I'd have to

21

check.

I'm not -- I'm not sure if he did.

He

22

did pay them before the divorce.

23

if the -- I -- I -- the policy was live at the

24

time of his death.

25

may have been funded by the premiums that had

I'm not sure

I'm not sure -- I think it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

already been paid on the policy.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That -- that was

3

just a factual question.

4

introduce your argument and tell us what your

5

--

6

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You may want to

My understanding is -­
-- what your general

8

outline is going to be, but I -­

9

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I'll just answer your

10

question.

11

already paid enough into the policy that the

12

policy itself paid the premiums at a certain

13

point.

14
15
16

My understanding is that he had

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

That

could be.
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So I think that's -­

17

so I don't think he actually paid any more

18

after the divorce.

19

that's what's in that.

20

My understanding is that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In the course of

21

your argument, suppose this were the first

22

statute on this subject.

23

difference?

24

hypothetical, suppose the empirical evidence

25

were such that most people assumed that divorce

Would that make a

And then I could add to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

would not change the beneficiary, would that

2

change -- but I interrupted you at the first.

3

You might have a broader outline you want to

4

give.

5

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

No, I -- I -- I'm

6

happy to answer those questions at the outset.

7

So your first question is, what if this was the

8

first statute on -- on this issue; in other

9

words, the first ever revocation-on-divorce

10

statute?

11

the first of these statutes were enacted around

12

30 years ago, there already were a number of

13

statutes, almost universally, in fact, that

14

revorced -- that revoked wills upon divorce.

15

Well, I'd point out that even when

So, really, the -- the historic

16

purpose of these statutes, according to the

17

Uniform Probate Code, was to align the law of

18

life insurance policies with the law of wills.

19

So we would take the position that even the

20

first of these statutes that was enacted could

21

be applied to existing policies under the -­

22

the Contracts Clause.

23

To turn to your second question, which

24

was what if, empirically speaking, someone

25

didn't know?

So, first of all, I do think that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

-- I don't mean to fight the hypothetical, but,

2

in this case, I think the legislature made the

3

empirical determination that the typical person

4

designates a spouse as a beneficiary because

5

it's the spouse, and when the divorce happens,

6

the calculus changes.

7
8

And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
what?

On the basis of

Where in the record?

9

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

10

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Where in the

11

record is the basis for their empirical

12

finding?

13

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

There's no -- the

14

legislative history doesn't include any surveys

15

or anything like that.

16
17

I -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They were picking

up off the Uniform Probate Code, weren't they?

18

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Minnesota was

20

picking up the model statute, and the model

21

statute started it off and then in another -­

22

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

That is correct.

So

23

Minnesota, like numerous other states, simply

24

implemented the Uniform Probate Code.

25

think that there's any hearings in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I don't

Official
7
1

legislative record regarding the empirical

2

findings underlying that -- that code.

3

it's -­

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think

But there was -­

5

there was a -- I mean, if there's -- the

6

supposition is, on divorce, the policyholder

7

will not want the ex-spouse to get the policy.

8

But, as has been pointed out, sometimes there

9

will be a desire that the beneficiary remain

10
11

unchanged.
It was suggested by the other side

12

that Minnesota could have accomplished this in

13

a much better way; that is, they could have

14

made it a condition of every divorce decree

15

that the judge tell the couple:

16

insurance -- do you have life insurance?

17

you want to leave it as it is, or do you want

18

to change it?

19

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Life
Do

Yeah, so, first of

20

all, no other statute actually does it that way

21

without a revocation-on-divorce statute.

22

Respondent does cite statutes like that from

23

Virginia and Utah, but those states also have

24

revocation-on-divorce statutes.

25

notification requirements are -- are kind of a

These

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

supplement to that.

2

I guess Minnesota could have done

3

that, but I don't think it would accomplish the

4

goal of the statute, which was to align the law

5

of life insurance policies which -- with the

6

law of wills, which is what the Uniform Probate

7

Code said, because, again, wills automatically

8

-- excuse me, a divorce automatically revokes

9

the -­

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, I think,

11

counsel, Justice Ginsburg's question goes to

12

the -- the weighing that some of our cases

13

suggest that we have to do in this -- these

14

cases.

15

have, that Minnesota could achieve everything

16

it wants to achieve by prospectively applying

17

this law and then retroactively or -- ordering

18

courts to make sure that this issue is dealt

19

with in divorce decrees, how does that inform

20

our analysis as to the legitimacy and need for

21

overriding contracts in these cases?

22

And if you concede, as I believe you

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So, first of all, I

23

would -- I don't agree with the premise that

24

Minnesota could have achieved all they wanted

25

to achieve just by this notice requirement.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

First of all, I think that, again, the goal is

2

to align the law of life insurance policies

3

with the law of wills, and the will is revoked.

4

So Minnesota wanted to -­

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Prospectively,

6

though, you acknowledge it could have achieved

7

all it wants to achieve?

8

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yes, that's true.
And, retroactively,

10

it could have done as Justice Ginsburg suggests

11

and told divorce courts that this is a matter

12

that they'd have to take up.

13

they wouldn't be able to achieve all that they

14

wanted to achieve?

15

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So how is it that

Well, because, first

16

of all, I mean, the person might not do it and

17

you might get into all these disputes about

18

what -- what a decree means.

19

reasons for this statute is that decrees were

20

often ambiguous in what they did, whether they

21

were intended to revoke the designation or not.

22

And this statute eliminates this ambiguity.

23

One of the

That ambiguity wouldn't go away if you

24

just told people don't forget, you have to

25

change your policy.

They wouldn't do it, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

then you'd have a dispute over what the decree

2

means.

3

So I think that the reason that no

4

state has adopted that option without a

5

revocation-on-divorce statute is precisely

6

because those problems wouldn't be solved.

7

I want to make one other point about

8

the retroactivity issue, though, which is that,

9

first of all, I don't think that the arguments

10

that the -- that the statute doesn't really -­

11

is inconsistent with the intent of a typical

12

spouse, I don't think that goes to the

13

retroactivity of a statute.

14

argument that the statute's sort of a bad idea

15

both going backwards and going forwards.

16

It's more of an

And I don't think the Contracts Clause

17

is designed to protect against just bad

18

statutes generally.

19

against unfairly retroactive statutes.

20

here -­

21

It's designed to protect

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Well, does -­

22

does the beneficiary on the policy -- is that

23

individual properly viewed as a third-party

24

beneficiary under contract law?

25

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

No, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It's

Official
11
1

been conceded in this case that she -­

2

Respondent had no contractual interest.

3

why the sole interest she's protecting is Mark

4

Sveen's interest under a theory of third-party

5

standing.

6

interest, then this case would be very

7

different.

8

not apply if there's a protected -­

9

That's

I think that if she had a protected

And, by the way, the statute does

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that a

10

matter -- putting aside what you regard as a

11

concession, I don't know if your friend would

12

agree with that, but is it a uniform conclusion

13

under state law, the common law, that a

14

beneficiary is not -- I mean, they're called

15

the same thing, third-party beneficiary, under

16

contract law?

17

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, the relevant

18

question is whether that person has enforceable

19

vested rights in -- in the contract.

20

actually can buy an insurance policy if you

21

want to that says that there's a third-party

22

beneficiary who -- who has a vested right, and

23

you -- you can't change it without the person's

24

consent.

25

you want to.

So you

You can buy that kind of policy if
And this statute wouldn't apply

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

by its terms to such a policy.

2

But in this particular case, it was

3

agreed as the case was litigated that it was

4

Mark Sveen's rights at issue because she -- he

5

had the -- he had the right to change the

6

beneficiary days -- excuse me, decisions at

7

will.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do -- do any states

say that the -- a person that is the named

10

beneficiary is a third-party beneficiary for

11

contract purposes?

12

Do any states say that?

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I think that -- so my

13

understanding is they can be depending on what

14

the contract says.

15

buy insurance if you want to -­

16
17
18

So you can always, right,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that was -­

that was your answer.
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

-- that designates the

19

person as a third-party beneficiary with

20

enforceable rights at the time it's purchased.

21

You can do that in Minnesota or everywhere.

22

And in that case, the statute wouldn't apply.

23

But here, in this case, as this case

24

reaches this Court, the argument is that it was

25

Mr. Sveen's, the decedent's, contractual rights

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

that were infringed.

Respondent didn't have

2

any vested rights in the contract at the time

3

that Mark Sveen bought it because he had the

4

right to designate -- redesignate at will.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Unikowsky -­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could you just -­

-- on the

8

retroactivity point, here, the statute precedes

9

both the divorce and the death.

But what would

10

happen if the divorce happened first and then

11

the enactment of the statute and then the

12

death?

Would the statute have applied?

13

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

14

unsettled question of state law.

15

there is a -- there's an unpublished Minnesota

16

decision that says it would apply in that

17

context because the person can still

18

redesignate.

19

retroactivity concerns, but I think it's

20

retroactivity concerns with respect to the

21

divorce decree.

22

altering an employed term of the decree.

23

So I -- that's an
I think that

So I think that does present some

In other words, it seems to be

So I think the analysis in that case

24

would be kind of a due process analysis because

25

it's an issue of changing a judgment rather

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1
2
3
4

than changing the -- the preexisting contract.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But your answer for

Contract Clause purposes would be the same?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yes.

With respect to

5

the underlying insurance policy, yes.

6

that the -- the reason that there would be a

7

retroactivity concern is that it would

8

interfere with settled expectations at the time

9

of the divorce.

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

11

rather than the contract?

12

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I think

Based on the decree

Yes, Your Honor.

And

13

I think that's an important point in this case

14

because, again, the Contracts Clause protects

15

the reliance interest.

16

why it distinguishes between contracts that are

17

signed before and after the statute's enacted.

18

Fundamentally, that's

And in a case like this, I think the

19

reliance interests really come into play at the

20

time of the divorce, because the statute is

21

inert until the divorce actually happens.

22

And that's when people are thinking

23

about this, because they're making a decision,

24

okay, there's this changed circumstance, I'm no

25

longer married to this person, do I want them

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

to stay the beneficiary or do I not want them

2

to stay the beneficiary?

3

And at the time that that decision is

4

made, the existence of the statute makes a

5

difference in what they do because, if they

6

know the statute's on the books, they don't

7

have to contact the insurance company and

8

change the designation.

9

statute was passed years before the divorce

10

And in this case, the

occurred.

11

So I think it's -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me,

13

what are the various ways that a -- an insured

14

who wants to keep his former wife as the

15

beneficiary, what would he have to do after the

16

divorce?

17
18
19

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How does the

insurance company know that there has been a

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

that the insurance company has -- has lawyers

15

who's aware that these statutes are -- are on

16

the books.

18

5

assume that they'll just put it in the person's

6

file, it'll have a date on it, and then the

7

person -- the spouse will be re-added.

8
9

I think in many cases this is resolved
in the divorce decree, especially where here

10

the statute was on the books at the time of the

divorce.

really small divorces, I think.

13

Are there -- are there any cases that you can

14

rely on that -- out in the state courts that

15

are analogous to this?

16

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yeah, so I think the

17

-- the -- the -- the best analogy maybe I'd

18

have are statutes that -- or, rather, statutes

19

that affected the way property was divided in

20

divorce.

21

out my remarks today.

And this was the way I -- I started

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

In divorce.
So, you know, in the

24

1970s, there was a very dramatic revolution in

25

American divorce law.

Before the '70s,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

divorcing wives were left often destitute after

2

divorce.

3

all the states passed statutes that

4

fundamentally altered divorce and made the

5

distribution of assets more equitable.

6

still are statistically worse off in divorce,

7

but it's better now than it was in -- in 1950.

20

We view this as analogous because,

really, again, the statute is inert until

there's a divorce, and even when there's a

divorce, all the statute does is it regulates

24
25

That there's no impairment

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Right, so we have the

broader arguments and the narrower arguments in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

our brief.

2

brief, that's not an impairment, because it's

3

like a will.

4

analogous to a will.

5

It may be bad for money in a will to be

6

distributed to some party, but that's not a

7

contractual obligation.

8
9

Under the broadest argument in my

We make the argument this is
A will isn't a contract.

But if you disagree with me, Your
Honor, we have several arguments in our brief

10

that distinguish this precise scenario you have

11

discussed.

12

our brief is that this is a mere default rule

13

and that's not an impairment when there's only

14

a paperwork burden.

15

So one of our leading arguments in

That argument which we make which is

16

supported by numerous 19th Century cases, long

17

before Blaisdell, would not apply to the

18

hypothetical you've just given.

19

So we cite a number of cases in which

20

there's these recording statutes that say, if

21

you don't submit a piece of paperwork to the

22

government, you lose your rights altogether.

23

They're extinguished.

24
25

And those statutes did not exist at
the time the contract was purchased.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

And in a series of 19th century cases,

2

from peak -- a peak era of enforcement of the

3

Contracts Clause, the Court had no difficulty

4

upholding those statutes saying it's just a

5

paperwork obligation and, therefore, there's no

6

impairment in the relevant sense.

7

And so -­

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

They also talked

about remedies, right, as being distinct from
obligations, didn't they?

11

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Some of those -­

14

destroyed the obligations altogether.

15

you didn't submit the recording obligation, the

17

don't think it's a remedial issue.

18

that's wiping out the rights.

But I think that these were not

So that's not -- I

example that has nothing to do with contractual

remedies.

That was a case involving a

2

right?

3

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

4

rights were completely wiped out.

5

-- the land patent just ceased to exist.

6

someone else bought the property, your

7

contractual rights were eliminated.

8

think that's really remedial argument.

9

would just completely destroy the rights of the

contract, period.

11

And maybe the Gilfillan case is a

12

better example, which is a good 19th century

13

case which was not a case about remedies.

14

was a case involving a corporate bondholder

15

settlement where the legislature was concerned

16

that -- that citizens wouldn't agree to the

17

settlement which might not leave the company

18

afloat.

19

if you don't dissent affirmatively from the

20

settlement, you'll be deemed to have consented

21

to the settlement.

22

That

So it enacted this statute saying that

And the Court had no difficulty

23

upholding the statute, saying it's a mere

24

paperwork obligation; all you have to do is

25

send a letter to the insurance company -- or -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

or to the -- to the company in that case;

2

there's no impairment of a contractual

3

obligation.

4

And that's the same -- excuse me,

5

that's the same impairment in this case.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You made the

7

point earlier that -- I understood you to make

8

the point that this would be outside the scope

9

of the Contract Clause because it was an

10

exercise of the state's police power?

11

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

In the -- yes.

That's

12

a different argument in the context of divorce.

13

Maybe I -­

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah.

But -­

15

but is that true to the full extent of the

16

police power?

17

characterize as a police power authority would

18

be exempt from scrutiny under the Contract

19

Clause?

20

Anything that we would

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

No, this is a -- an

21

argument of the sui generis nature of divorce.

22

So the relevant point for us is that even when

23

Mr. Sveen -- and I'm sorry to be jumping around

24

between these arguments -- but even when

25

Mr. Sveen purchased the insurance policy, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

state had the authority to decide what would

2

happen to that beneficiary designation in a

3

divorce.

4

where courts are bound by the intent of the

5

parties.

6

bought the policy, had the power to give the

7

policy to his ex-spouse as part of the

8

equitable distribution of property or force him

9

to keep paying proceeds to the ex-spouse as an

It's not like an ordinary contract

A divorce court, even at the time he

ancillary to an alimony order.

11

--

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So I think that

My problem with

13

the police power argument you're making is that

14

I don't think it stands alone, meaning you can

15

think that the state has a greater interest in

16

certain areas like divorce or others, regulated

17

fields like mineral, et cetera, but I don't

18

think that state police power gives unbounded

19

discretion to the state.

20

To some extent, it's intermixed with

21

what's the state's purpose and is it a

22

legitimate thing it's doing.

23

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Your Honor, we are not

24

arguing for unbounded state power.

There's

25

this particular argument about divorce which is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

premised on the fact that even when Mr. Sveen

2

bought the policy, the divorce court had made

3

-- it was the divorce court's decision on what

4

would happen to that policy in a divorce.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that goes

6

back to Justice Gorsuch's question, could the

7

state say, upon divorce, I'm giving the money

8

to the state or I'm giving it to a charity, et

9

cetera?

10

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

See -­
And you said yes,

but I wasn't quite sure why.

13

It seems to me that, even under state

14

power, you have to be able to articulate some

15

fit between the need and the solution.

16

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Right.

So my response

17

to Justice Gorsuch was about a different

18

argument about treating insurance policies like

19

wills.

20

you that I don't think that just giving the

21

money to a charity or to the government could

22

conceivably be deemed as an exercise of

23

preexisting police power, because, at the time

24

Mark Sveen bought his policy, a divorce court

25

couldn't just randomly take the parties' assets

With regard to a divorce, I agree with

That was not within the

argument, the difference between Justice

preexisting power vested in courts and -­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Please.

13

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

No, go ahead, I'm

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So this might be an

14
15

sorry.

16

unfair question, but one of the things that

17

struck me in reading your brief and now in

18

listening to you, it's a -- it's an unusual

19

thing we see in your brief, this kind of we

20

have five arguments in varying levels.

21

You know, it's -- it's the police

22

power; it's not a contractual obligation; it's

23

not an impairment at all; it's not a

24

substantial impairment; maybe it is, but it's

25

justified.

Did I get all those five right?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

2

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

you think?

Yes, you did.

Really, which one do

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- you know, you're

7

answering some of our questions like, oh,

8

that's an answer from column 1.

9

can give you an answer from column 3.

10

And no, now I

But when we have to decide this case,

11

we presumably have to pick one.

12

to go with you, I mean, where do you really

13

think that the -- this -- this is -- the

14

question is here?

15

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

And if we were

I think that the -­

16

the cleanest way to vote for us, and I hope you

17

do, is that it's just -- it's really just a

18

default rule and it's just a paperwork burden

19

and there's no interference with the reliance

20

interests, because, really, the reliance

21

interests come into play at the time of the

22

divorce.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you're -- you're

24

saying it's not a substantial alteration; is

25

that the -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

5

So I

think there's -­

3
4

That's right.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that the same

argument?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yes, I -- I think so.

6

And there's really two pieces to that.

One is

7

that you only have to send in a letter to the

8

company, and this Court has said in a lot of

9

cases that that's not a sufficient impairment

10

to implicate the Contracts Clause.

And also

11

the fact that the -- the goal of the Contracts

12

Clause is to protect reliance interests.

13

here, realistically, the reliance interests

14

come to play at the time of the divorce because

15

the statute's inert until then.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

When you say

17

it's not a substantial impairment, are you

18

acknowledging that it is an impairment?

19

least in terms of ranking your -- your

20

arguments?

21

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

At

I don't think it's an

22

impairment at all, but I think that because

23

this Court has held that insubstantial

24

impairments are not impairments at all, I think

25

that's sort of an easier way to get to where we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

want.

2

and I'm -- I stick to our argument today, that

3

there's just not an impairment, period, because

4

it's simply the exercise as an option that

5

leaves the option to redesignate the

6

beneficiary by sending a letter.

7

But, certainly, we argue in our brief,

I also think the divorce aspect of the

8

case is important.

And I do think the

9

arguments sort of go together.

The -- the

10

state has broad authority over divorce.

11

always has.

12

and James Kent, who have given broad powers to

13

the legislature over divorce.

14

It

We quote James -- John Marshall

And if the Court is concerned that you

15

don't want to give the legislature unlimited

16

power over divorce, then you can say:

17

the -- the legislature has broad powers to

18

legislate the effect of a divorce decree and

19

how -- you know, maybe even if that power is

20

not unlimited, it at least extends to imposing

21

this kind of paperwork burden, which, even

22

outside the divorce context, this Court has

23

already held does not constitute a substantial

24

impairment.

25

Well,

So I'd like to reserve my time if I

may.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8

MR. DVORETZKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

9

The Constitution forbids states from

10

passing any law impairing the obligation of

11

contracts.

12

retroactively altered the contractual means by

13

which policyholders select who will receive

14

policy proceeds, and it did so even though it

15

had evident alternatives, such as requiring

16

notice of the revocation statute in divorce

17

decrees, to achieve its purposes equally well

18

but without impairing contractual obligations.

19

Here, Minnesota directly and

Minnesota, therefore, violated the

20

Contracts Clause's clear prohibition, whether

21

this Court returns to that clause's original

22

understanding, takes the smaller step of

23

treating impairments of public and private

24

contracts alike, or simply applies current

25

doctrine.

If a divorce court can do that, why
can't the legislature make the same assessment?
MR. DVORETZKY:

Because the Contracts

10

Clause applies to laws passed by legislatures

11

and not to the actions of courts.

12

Chief Justice Taft explained that in

13

an opinion long -- a long time ago, and that

14

opinion itself cited 20 other precedents of

15

this Court saying the same thing.

16

from the text of the Contracts Clause that it

17

speaks only of laws.

18

-- that the Contracts Clause would only apply

19

to legislatures rather than courts because

20

courts are constantly in the business of

21

addressing contractual disputes, and the

22

framers did not mean to constitutionalize every

23

Contracts Clause case.

24
25

It follows

And it makes sense that

But when a state -­

do what they do as a result of laws, meaning

that.

21

Suppose the state said that, in a

And the

Then you have a contract clause.

Just

22

the fact that the court is implementing the

23

state's policy doesn't mean that it's a court

24

decree, not a state decree.

25

MR. DVORETZKY:

I think there -- there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

is -- there has historically been a fundamental

2

distinction, though, between what courts do and

3

what legislatures do, and that's a result,

4

again, both of precedent and of the commonsense

5

notion that the Contracts Clause can't apply to

6

what courts do, or else every time a court does

7

anything with respect to a contract, outside

8

the divorce context as well, every time a court

9

declares a contract unconscionable, that would

10

be a contracts violation.

11

That just can't be.

But this Court has long recognized, as

12

the framers intended, that when a legislature

13

passes a law that impairs contract, that is

14

getting directly at the heart of what the

15

Contracts Clause was intended to cover.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I take it here

17

the contract is -- let's call him Mr. Smith -­

18

19

20

money will still go to the designated

21

beneficiary.

23

MR. DVORETZKY:

JUSTICE BREYER:

That -­
That's the situation

in front of us?

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's -- yes.
Yes.

Okay.

Now I

6

found this -- three cases from the 19th century

7

-- 1870s, 1880s, 1923 -- not a period when this

8

Court was about to interpret the Contracts

9

Clause loosely.

10

I think that's fair.

One of the cases says the legislature

11

passes a law after Smith, who is a bondholder

12

of a corporation, enters into a contract with

13

the corporation.

14

and the corporation.

15

So this is a contract, Smith
They have a bond.

The legislature passes a law that

16

makes that bond less valuable, less valuable.

17

All right?

18

Court says:

19

Applies it retroactively.

And this

That's fine.

You know why?

Because all that Smith

20

has to do in order to stop its value going

21

down, rejecting the change, is affirmatively

22

notify the company.

23

isn't a big deal.

24
25

Case two:

And they say:

No, that

Okay?
Smith buys property at a

tax sale, at a tax sale.

All right?

Now the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

owners can get it back, by the way, if they pay

2

their taxes within a year or some period of

3

time.

4

Smith, you can't keep your property unless you

5

tell the owners they're about to lose it.

They pass a law retroactively saying:

6

That would seem to make quite a

7

difference, because, after all, if they find

8

out, they might object and pay the back-taxes.

9
10

The court says:

Not a big deal.

It

doesn't violate the clause.

Case three.

Yeah, Smith has an agreement with the

Surely, an affidavit is no easier to

19

file than to write a letter to an insurance

company.

21

obligation -- you have not violated the

22

Contracts Clause, because filing an extra

23

affidavit is not a big deal.

24
25

The Court says:

That is not an

So, when I read those three cases, I
looked at what they said was not a big deal.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Then I looked at the obligation here, which is

just what they're arguing.

you?

11

MR. DVORETZKY:

First, Justice Breyer,

12

let me emphasize the -- the key term of this

13

contractual -- this contract, the life

14

insurance contract, provides precisely how the

15

policyholder is to designate the beneficiary

16

and, in turn, assures the policyholder that

17

that is the beneficiary that will be paid.

18

That is -­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

mortgage contract.

21
22

25

All right, go -­

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, I disagree that

it's -­

23
24

Just like the

JUSTICE BREYER:
ahead.

No -- so -- so go

Sorry.
MR. DVORETZKY:

That is different than

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43

the cases that -­

2
3
4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Okay.

Go

ahead.
MR. DVORETZKY:

That is different than

5

the cases that you were talking about.

6

start with the Gilfillan case.

7

case involving the bond and the -- the

8

retroactive -- the retroactive change there.

9

Let me

That is the

The Court went out of its way in the

10

Gilfillan opinion to point out that the -- the

11

bond contract there was a particular kind of

12

contract in which bondholders effectively

13

assume obligations to one another.

14

It's a type of contract where there is

15

like a good -- a duty of good faith and fair

16

dealing to your co-bondholders.

17

different than our case, where the policyholder

18

has a direct and explicit assurance about the

19

beneficiary designation.

20
21
22

That's very

So there's a difference in the -- in
the nature of the impairment.
Moreover, in the Gilfillan case, the

23

Court also focused on the practicalities and

24

whether or not it was still reasonably possible

25

for the bondholder to protect his original

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

contractual rights.

2

there was both actual notice of the change and

3

sufficient time to object to it.

4

And the Court noted that

Whereas, in this case, the entire

5

premise of the Minnesota law, according to the

6

Petitioners, is that policyholders are

7

inattentive to their beneficiary designations.

8

It is simply -- it's paradoxical to

9

expect an inattentive policyholder, somebody

10

who is presumed not to know about this or to be

11

paying attention to it, to protect their rights

12

by -- by being aware of the law and then

13

objecting to the change.

14

And so the practicalities here cut

15

exactly the opposite way as in -­

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that might be

17

true -- I'm sorry to -- that might be true if

18

the divorce preceded the statute, right,

19

because, presumably, the time when even an

20

inattentive person is going to come upon this

21

problem is when the divorce occurs.

22

And as long as the divorce is

23

subsequent to the statute, I don't see how you

24

can make that argument.

25

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, I would agree

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

with you if Minnesota had taken the same kind

2

of step that Virginia has taken and actually

3

required the divorce decree to inform the

4

divorcing parties about the

5

revocation-on-divorce statute.

6

At least under modern doctrine, that

7

would solve our concerns because, at that

8

point, you're right, as part of the divorce,

9

the policyholder, the divorcing party, would be

10

aware of the change.

11

But there's no reason to presume that

12

as part of the divorce, absent such a notice

13

requirement, that the inattentive policyholder

14

is aware.

15

statute is that people do go through divorces,

16

but this issue of beneficiary designations is

17

not something that they are paying attention

18

to.

19

Indeed, the whole premise of the

And so -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you think it's

20

not a fair assumption that most people when

21

they divorce do not want their former spouse to

22

be enriched beyond whatever the law requires,

23

if you have to make a guess?

24
25

You're talking about an impairment of
the policyholder's rights.

But the Minnesota

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

legislature has said, not 100 percent, but most

2

cases of divorce, the spouse who is the

3

policyholder would not want the former spouse

4

to get the proceeds, would much prefer they go

5

to his children.

6

MR. DVORETZKY:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't that a

8

reasonable assumption for a legislature to

that it is, at least not without some evidence

in the record to that effect.

13

statement of legislative purpose, there's no

14

amicus support from Minnesota or from any other

15

states whose laws are at issue here, as to the

16

empirical assumption that your question

17

suggests.

18

And there's no

I think that there are some people who

19

would want to keep -- who would want to change

20

beneficiary designations, but there are plenty

21

of reasons why people might not.

22

the federal government and almost half the

23

states don't have this kind of a law.

24

--

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's why

And if

I'd like to ask the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

question I asked Mr. Unikowsky.

2

what the settlement was in the divorce decree,

3

what Melin got out of the divorce?

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

Do you know

Justice Ginsburg, that

5

is in -- the district court docket for that is

6

45-3, and it spells out who got which car, and

7

I think there was a snowmobile and an ATV and

8

some other property.

9

at District Court 45-3.

10
11
12

But it's all spelled out

But what the divorce decree -- two
things of note on the divorce decree.
One, it is silent about insurance, and

13

so we simply don't know one way or another

14

based on the divorce decree itself what Mr.

15

Sveen's intentions were.

16

We do know that Ms. Melin put an -­

17

had an affidavit in the record that they had

18

maintained -- that they had reached an oral

19

agreement to maintain one another as

20

beneficiaries.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but that was

not approved.
MR. DVORETZKY:

That's true.

But the

24

only evidence in the record, one way or

25

another, that didn't satisfy Minnesota's clear

Heritage Reporting Corporation

and convincing evidence standard for an oral

The other -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if there were -­

what if there was evidence that Mr. Sveen was

10

very well aware of this statute at the time of

11

the divorce but did nothing?

12

So suppose there was testimony by 10

13

witnesses that at the time of the divorce he -­

14

he got a copy of the statute and he read it?

15

MR. DVORETZKY:

I -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would that make a

17
18

difference?
MR. DVORETZKY:

I still don't think it

19

would make a difference, because the way the

20

Court has considered these sorts of impairment

21

questions and whether -- whether it is possible

22

to overcome the impairment by informing the

23

insurance company has been on an

24

across-the-board basis, not based on the

25

particular facts of a case.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

So the McGahey case, which is from the

2

era that Justice Breyer was asking me about

3

earlier, is an example of this.

4

case where, retroactively, the state required

5

bondholders to produce the original bond, and

6

not just the bond coupon, in order to collect.

7

That was the

And there were surely some -- some

8

bondholders who could have produced the

9

original bond but many who couldn't.

10
11

And the

Court -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Which is easier?

12

Which is easier?

To produce an original bond

13

that you bought, say, 20 years ago, and who

14

knows where it is, or to write a letter saying,

15

please, keep my wife as beneficiary?

16

loaded question.

17

MR. DVORETZKY:

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. DVORETZKY:

That's a

Well -­

But -- but -- but I

20

think it's -- it's a loaded -- it's a loaded

21

question because it has a premise built into it

22

that it's only easy to file the form if you are

23

aware of the need to do so.

24

premise of the Minnesota law is that people are

25

not aware of the need to do so.

And the whole

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I said likely.

3

expert, which family law is the most difficult

4

subject I think there is.

5

human, terrible.

6

I'm not a family law

It's horrible,

It's really difficult.

But if I were to guess, I would guess

7

that when there is a divorce proceeding,

8

there's a lawyer, quite often, usually, and he

9

discusses with his client, the lawyer, what -­

10

that this is likely to affect property.

11

Now I'm not saying which, but a lot of

people would think:

policy.

14

but I suspect.

15

I have an insurance

Now I don't know that that happens,

MR. DVORETZKY:

I suspect that

sometimes it does, but it doesn't always happen

because not everybody even -­

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're absolutely

19

right on that.

I mean, that might not be a

20

fair question because sometimes people will and

21

sometimes they won't.

23

and that's true.

24

of it, that's true.

25

perhaps neither of us knows how often they

And sometimes they will think
I don't think actually

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51

think of it.

2

MR. DVORETZKY:

Right.

But I think

3

the point is that what the Contracts Clause is

4

concerned with is the impairment of the rights

5

of those who weren't counseled, who are not

6

aware, who don't know that they need to file

7

the form.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Dvoretzky, if

I could come back to Justice Alito's question

10

because, in answering Justice Alito, you say we

11

don't look to Mr. Sveen in particular, even if

12

we know a lot about him.

13

class of people who are in this situation.

14

We look to this broad

And if that's true -- I mean, I guess

15

I had sort of conceptualized your argument as

16

the exact opposite.

17

anything about Mr. Sveen, so even if it's true

18

that people generally want to give their life

19

insurance policy to their children, that

20

doesn't matter because we don't know that about

21

Mr. Sveen.

22

Well, we don't know

But if you're saying:

Really, we look

23

to the broad class of people, then why

24

shouldn't the broad class of people that we

25

look to be -- you know, why shouldn't we make

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

the same judgment that the -- or -- that the

2

legislature made or at least accept that

3

judgment that if we look to the broad class of

4

people, most of them would rather give their

5

life insurance policy to their children than to

6

the -- their divorced spouse?

7

MR. DVORETZKY:

Because I think it's

8

indisputable that whether or not most would,

9

many would not.

10

And -- and the contracts -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but you just

11

said we're not -- I mean, if -- if -- if the

12

question is the class, rather than the

13

individual, then what option do we have other

14

than to say something in general about the

15

class?

16

MR. DVORETZKY:

Because I think when

17

you speak about the class as a whole, you're

18

also encompassing some individual -- some

19

individuals within that class who aren't going

20

to want their rights to -- to be abrogated by

21

the legislature.

22

And what the Contracts Clause is

23

concerned with is making sure, even under this

24

Court's modern jurisprudence, that the

25

legislature doesn't abrogate the rights of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53

some, even if it's intending to benefit others

2

by effectuating their intent.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But it seems to me

you're -- your answer to me, to my question,

leads to the conclusion that you are impairing

6

the insured's -- the obligations that the

7

insured counts on in -- in relation to the

contract.

9

There's a contract.

The meaning of

the contract is determined by state law.

or another, besides the -- the conduct of the

parties after the divorce with respect to

evidence that Mr. Sveen either was or was not

aware of it.

20

And, as we've been

The -- the divorce decree that I cited

earlier at 45-3 has a very long appendix with

22

various notices that Minnesota already requires

divorce courts to provide and divorce decrees

to include.

state has come forward to advance for why it

needed to achieve its purported goals in this

case the way it did.

4

And by -- by doing this the way it

5

did, it is impairing the contractual rights of

6

at least some policyholders, those who have

7

good reasons for not wanting to revoke their

8

beneficiary designations.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Just one second.

I

10

took -- I took Justice Alito as asking

11

something like this, but -- and I am curious.

12

A lot of people did buy life insurance policies

13

before 2002 which don't say anything about it,

14

right?

15

They bought it before.
A lot of people probably were divorced

16

between 2002 and 2018.

17

this case, what happens to all those people who

18

were told by their lawyers that state law means

19

that your wife is no longer the beneficiary

20

unless you write a letter to the insurance

21

company?

to be.

And they say:

My -- my question for you,

though, I want to pick up where Justice Breyer

left off, and that's recording statutes.

12

do we do about those?

13

that those are fine and -- even though they

14

pose some limits on -- on contracting.

15

and your colleague on the other side suggested

16

that the best line we draw is how substantial

17

the impairment is.

What

This Court has long held

And -­

This Court has approved recording

19

statutes as an impairment.

20

those?

What do we do about

21

MR. DVORETZKY:

The recording statutes

are different for a few reasons.

express term of the contract in the way that

Sotomayor, the contract in those cases didn't

15

speak one way or another to the recording

16

obligation.

17

change as to remedy that legislatures adopted

after the fact.

19

That was simply a procedural

Second, the -- the recording statutes

don't leave the property owners without

recourse.

23

only one of them can get the property, but the

fundamentally different because they're not

as the law that's at issue here, and there's

still -- there's still a remedy.

provide for a particular beneficiary.

It's not

9

I'd also suggest from -- again from

10

this era of cases, that the relevant analogs

11

are the Seibert and the McGahey cases, and

12

those two cases stand for -- for two

13

propositions.

14

One, Seibert stands for the

15

proposition that, when a legislature does

16

directly change a term of the contract, that in

17

that situation, the Court has found -- has

18

found a Contracts Clause violation.

19

So, in Seibert, there was a bond that

20

provided for a particular procedure for

21

collecting the taxes that would be used to pay

22

the bonds.

23

changed that, and the Court found a violation.

24

That's analogous to the situation here where

25

you have a contractual provision about

The legislature subsequently

beneficiary selection.

2

And then McGahey, as I was mentioning

3

earlier, that is the case where yet -- that is

4

the case where the bondholders had to produce

5

the original bond and the Court, looking at the

6

class of bondholders as a whole, recognized

7

that some bondholders might be able to meet

8

that requirement, but in order to protect the

9

rights of those who couldn't, and it was

10

impractical for those who couldn't to somehow

11

produce these bonds, the Court recognized that

12

there was a Contract Clause violation.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that goes back

14

to Justice Gorsuch's point, which is we look at

15

the nature of the impairment, how difficult is

16

it to do whatever is being changed.

17

there's a big difference between producing

18

something you may have lost 20 years before and

19

writing a letter to an insurance company or

20

including it in your divorce decree or doing

21

something else.

22

do.

23

And

It doesn't cost you much to

MR. DVORETZKY:

So, again, I think

24

those cases stand for the proposition that

25

there isn't -- the reason there wasn't an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

impairment there is that the contract was not

2

being directly altered by the legislature in

3

the way that it is here.

4

Even if you look at it as a

5

practicability question, though, the -- the

6

practical problem here is that policyholders

7

are presumed to be unaware.

8

the original understanding of the Contracts

9

Clause, any impairment was sufficient.

And, again, under

At a

10

minimum, if you -- if the Court were to

11

equalize the treatment of public and private

12

contracts, essentially ending the experiment

13

begun in U.S. Trust, the state here has a less

14

restrictive way of achieving its objectives

15

simply by providing notice.

16

And, lastly, even under the -- the

17

Court's more flexible modern precedents, if the

18

Contracts Clause means anything at all, it's

19

that the state can't impair contractual rights

20

gratuitously.

21

alternative that works equally well, at a

22

minimum, the state has to do that much.

23

Where -- where there is an

And -- and even under the Court's

24

modern cases, the Court has said repeatedly

25

that the Contracts Clause is more than just

9

And so what does that

At a minimum, it means, one, the state

There must
That's

And, second, where contractual rights
are impaired and there's a ready alternative,

10

at a minimum, the legislature ought to be

11

required to take that particular alternative.

12

Mr. Unikowsky suggested -­

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I -- what is

14

your position on a policy that's taken out

15

after the statute's enactment?

16

right?

17

MR. DVORETZKY:

Then it's okay,

Yes, that would -- if

18

the policy is taken out after the statute's

19

enactment, then the statute is not acting

20

retroactively on that policy.

21
22
23

JUSTICE ALITO:

What about the

retroactive application of a slayer statute?
MR. DVORETZKY:

So I think, under

24

modern Contracts Clause doctrine, that would

25

probably pass muster because the state's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

interest in ensuring that murderers don't

2

3

both intuitively and I'm sure -­

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

about the original understanding?

6

MR. DVORETZKY:

What about -- what

So, under the original

7

understanding, I think it's a harder question.

8

I think, arguably, if the slayer statute were

9

viewed as a form of punishment for murder, then

10

that could be within the -- the very narrow

11

original understanding of the legislature's

12

police power.

13

this case, which doesn't address -- again, the

14

original understanding of the police power,

15

something had to be directly related to health,

16

safety, or morals.

17

But that's very far removed from

So slayer statutes might survive under

18

the original understanding.

19

almost surely would survive under the modern

20

understanding because the interest is much

21

greater than the minor interest that's at issue

22

here, and I don't think that just a -- a notice

23

requirement wouldn't be sufficient in that

24

case.

25

I think they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was also, I

2

think, an example on the other side of a change

3

in the status of adopted children to make them,

4

for all purposes, the same as biological

5

children.

6

MR. DVORETZKY:

So I -- I think, under

7

the original understanding, that would be a

8

Contracts Clause violation.

9

test, there is a -- a court -- there is a case

Under the modern

10

we cited in our brief that has found such a

11

change to be unconstitutional.

12

It would, however -- there would,

13

however, be a stronger case for its

14

constitutionality than there is here if, under

15

the modern approach, the state thought that it

16

had a strong policy interest in ensuring the

17

equal treatment of adopted children.

18

That, however, is fundamentally

19

different from this case, where -- where no one

20

has made any showing of a strong policy

21

interest in effectuating the presumed intent of

22

some policyholders at the expense of the intent

23

of others.

24
25

Mr. Unikowsky, in his argument, made a
few points as to why the Virginia alternative,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

or a notice alternative, would not be

2

sufficient, that I'd just like to briefly

3

address.

4

One, the notice -- the notice that is

5

provided can exist alongside the

6

revocation-on-divorce statute.

7

a state is free to have, under the modern

8

approach, the revocation-on-divorce statute on

9

the books so long as it tells people.

In other words,

And -­

10

and it's also free to do the same thing -- have

11

the same revocation-on-divorce statute for

12

wills and for life insurance policies, and also

13

to provide the same notice for wills and for

14

life insurance policies.

15

And so, in that respect, that achieves

16

the goal that -- that Mr. Unikowsky posited of

17

achieving equal treatment of wills and life

18

insurance policies so long as that is actually

19

what people want, as long as that is actually

20

what the -- the divorcing parties want.

21

As for disputes about what a decree -­

22

a decree means, the revocation-on-divorce

23

statute can take effect so long as there is

24

notice.

25

dispute about what the decree means if, in

And so there doesn't need to be a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

fact, the -- the revocation-on-divorce statute

2

has simply taken effect.

3

If the Court has no further questions,

4

again, the Contracts Clause is absolute in its

5

language.

6

long ago that this was a clause so clear that

7

it could hardly be misunderstood and recognized

8

that it applied to all manner of contracts.

9

Chief Justice Marshall recognized

We ask that the Court bear that

10

original understanding of the Contracts Clause

11

in mind in resolving this case.

12

the more deferential modern approach, that

13

original understanding ought to inform the

14

approach, particularly where, as here, there's

15

a ready alternative to achieve all of the

16

state's objectives without impairing anybody's

17

contractual rights.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

23
24
25

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
So there's been a lot of different

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

arguments floating around at the argument

2

today.

3

wills, about reliance, and others.

4

to just say a few words about what I think

5

would be a -- a kind of a clean way to resolve

6

this case narrowly that wouldn't open some of

7

the parade of horribles that -- that some

8

members of the Court have been concerned about.

There's arguments about divorces, about

9

Some lower courts have conceptualized

10

life insurance policy beneficiary designations

11

as similar to wills.

12

that produces some of the concerns that Justice

Gorsuch posed questions about.

14

That's a broad argument

We stick to that argument, but the

Chief

Official
68

Justice Marshall himself said that the

2

Contracts Clause has never been understood to

3

restrict the general right of the legislature

to legislate on the subject of divorces.

think that we have a very strong originalist

6

argument that, specifically in the context of

7

divorce, the police power simply -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

because Justice Marshall also said that

marriage contracts are not within the

Contract Clause, or -- or do you?

But the statement that

right of the legislature to legislate on the

contracts are not within the cognizance of the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. UNIKOWSKY: -- an a fortiori case.

3

No, that's not why, Your Honor.

4

so.

5

I don't think

It's true he said that.

I acknowledge

6

that in our brief, that that was the context in

7

which he was saying it.

8

is an a fortiori kind of case, because if the

9

legislature has the power to sever a

But I think that this

10

contractual relationship -- a marriage

11

relationship all together, which will

12

necessarily have dramatic impacts on the

13

parties' property interests, I think it's a

14

much lesser power to simply regulate one way in

15

which a divorce decree severs that

16

relationship.

17

And I think that it's -- there's also

18

-- history provides a different lesson, which

19

is that there's never been a case ever, until a

20

few cases on the circuit split in this case,

21

where any court has held that a statute

22

regulating the effect of a divorce decree

23

violates the Contracts Clause.

24

for lack of opportunities, because the law of

25

equitable distribution of property has changed

And it's not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
70
1

dramatically over the century -- over the two

2

centuries.

3

never succeeded.

4

And yet, this type of argument has

So I think that, at a minimum,

5

especially in the context of a tradition of

6

state law control over divorce, there's a broad

7

police power there, but I -- I don't think the

8

Court has to hold that divorce courts have

9

unlimited power.

10

I think that if divorce -- if the

11

police power over divorce means anything, it's

12

the power to enact this very narrow kind of

13

default rule.

14

You know, my colleague talks about the

15

Seibert and McGahey -- and McGahey cases from

16

the 19th century.

17

different.

18

where state legislatures passed laws to

19

prevented hated out-of-state bondholders from

20

being paid back.

21

laws.

22

Those were dramatically

Those were post-Civil War era cases

That was the purpose of these

Professor Ely's book about the

23

Contracts Clause, who wrote an amicus brief in

24

this case, discusses the Virginia statute where

25

there's a whole bunch of cases where the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71
1

Virginia legislature specifically tried to

2

prevent bondholders from being paid back by

3

putting these requirements they knew that they

4

couldn't meet.

5

And then there's the -- the Seibert

6

case, where there was a contractual right to

7

force courts to pay money on these bonds, which

8

was abrogated.

9

prosecutor had to get the county court to pay

The new law provided that the

10

-- to raise taxes, which was never going to

11

happen.

12

So these were laws that were

13

specifically designed to prevent creditors from

14

being paid back.

15

from this case, which really is a paperwork

16

obligation, which is quite comparable to this

17

-- to the recording obligations that we talk

18

about.

19

That can't be more different

In fact, I think that this is less of

20

a burden, because, as Justice Sotomayor pointed

21

out, you don't submit that form, your land

22

patent is completely wiped out.

23

anything.

24

impairment than this case, where the failure to

25

submit a form is actually going to vindicate

You don't get

That strikes me as a far greater

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
72
1

the person's intent in the typical case.

2

So I think that when you talk about

3

the broad police power over divorce and then

4

the fact that it's only writing a letter, I

5

think the statute is constitutional, especially

6

-- and the third thing I'd like to talk about

7

is the reliance issue because this is a case

8

about retroactivity.

9

The question is not whether the Court

10

agrees with the statute or not.

11

isn't even whether it typically vindicates the

12

intent of the spouse or not.

13

question, both going forward or -- and

14

backwards.

15

The question

That's a policy

The question is whether it

16

retroactively impairs a contractual obligation.

17

And the answer is no, because the reliance

18

interest, as I think even my colleague

19

conceded, really comes into play at the time of

20

the divorce.

21

about this.

22

anything until the divorce happens.

23

That is when people are thinking
The statute doesn't even do

And I think that reliance is important

24

to the Contracts Clause because that's why the

25

clause distinguishes between statutes passed

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
73
1

before and after a contract, because of the

2

recognition that the contract itself generates

3

reliance interests.

4

And so, therefore, if -- it's

5

essentially undisputed that reliance interests

6

really come into play at the time of the

7

divorce rather than at the time of contracting,

8

it's just not an impairment of contractual

9

obligations in the relevant sense.

10

The only thing that would be impaired

11

-- the only reliance expectations that would be

12

impaired are those of Mark Sveen, who might not

13

be able to get the proceeds, or who might not

14

be able to distribute the proceeds as he

15

intended.
