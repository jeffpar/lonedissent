United States versus Sanchez-Gomez.

Mr. Kedem.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KEDEM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

An appellate court must have

12

statutory, as well as constitutional, authority

13

for its decisions, and, here, the Ninth Circuit

14

had neither.

15

Appellate review was not authorized

16

under Section 1291, which applies only to

17

district court decisions that are final, nor

18

under the All Writs Act.

19

Respondents' criminal cases had ended long

20

before the court of appeals ruled, their due

21

process claims were accordingly moot.

And because the

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On your first

23

point, you -- you didn't mention the

24

collateral-order doctrine.

25

mean, that's an exception to the 1291 final

What about that?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

judgment rule?

2

MR. KEDEM:

That's correct.

It's a

3

construction that this Court has given to the

4

final judgment rule.

5

applies here, most notably because Respondents'

6

due process claims could be reviewed following

7

final judgment, which is one of the

8

preconditions for application of the

9

collateral-order doctrine.

We don't think that that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but that -­

14

that assumes that the trial would somehow have

15

been affected.

16

be a legal violation in shackling people,

22

It seems to me there may well

They're not shackled during

So I -- it seems to me it's a

MR. KEDEM:

Justice Kennedy, I don't

23

think it necessarily has to affect the trial.

24

Recall here, for instance, that the Ninth

25

Circuit's decision in this case created a split

Heritage Reporting Corporation

with the Second and Eleventh Circuits, and in

2

both of those cases, there were challenges to

3

the use of physical restraints that came from

4

-- came after the fact.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what are -- the

6

-- the person is convicted and has a -- let's

7

say that he does or she does have an appeal on

8

-- on some different points.

9

And, incidentally, I was shackled during the -­

10

the pretrial.

11

that make to the outcome?

12

And they add:

What -- what difference does

MR. KEDEM:

I don't get it.

Well, it wouldn't

13

necessarily affect the outcome of the trial,

14

but, for instance, they could have a claim that

15

it affected some part of the pretrial process.

16

They had a suppression motion that was affected

17

because they couldn't contribute to their own

18

defense.

19

counsel.

20

They couldn't communicate with

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How did that

21

-- I saw that argument.

22

shackles affect their ability to communicate

23

with counsel?

24
25

MR. KEDEM:

How can -- how do the

Well, I would refer you to

the allegations that Respondents have made

Heritage Reporting Corporation

throughout this litigation.

2

allegations, for instance, that there were

3

criminal defendants who were unable to raise

4

their hands and get the attention of their

5

counsel.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So they've made

I mean, suppose that shackling a

10

before the magistrate does not affect the

11

outcome of his trial where he wasn't shackled.

12

All right?

13

MR. KEDEM:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

So -­
That's certainly

possible.

16

MR. KEDEM:

Sure.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

The first thing you

18

ask or would be in that case, the appeals court

19

says:

20

prejudice to his outcome.

21

raise the issue?

22

What's the prejudice?

MR. KEDEM:

There's no

Fine.

How does he

The question under the

23

collateral-order doctrine is not whether a

24

particular litigant or even most litigants who

25

want to raise that type of claim should -- are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

able to get relief after final judgment because

2

they can show prejudice.

3

The question is whether the type of

4

claim by its very nature is one for which a

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

question I asked you.

8

raise the issue?

9

MR. KEDEM:

That's not the

I asked you, how does he

I think it would be very

10

difficult in an instance in which there was no

11

allegation that it had any effect on the way

12

that the proceedings unfolded.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So you're

14

saying if, in fact -- it wouldn't -- I'm being

15

very hypothetical, absolutely hypothetical.

16

don't believe it would ever happen.

17

some chance, they have a policy in a court, a

18

federal court of the United States, that people

19

will come in bound and gagged in body armor,

20

hung upside down, okay, you're saying even if

21

that's so, that person in this country has no

22

way of challenging that order.

24

does he have by way of procedure to challenge

25

the order?

12

They could get mandamus in

There would be a clear abuse of

JUSTICE BREYER:

If they could get

13

mandamus in that case, why can't they ask for

14

mandamus in this case, where, after all, he has

15

been bound without an opportunity -- they bind

16

everybody, arms and legs?

17

Well, he won't win.

18

will win.

19
20
21

Now you can say:

I don't know.

Maybe he

But that's your point, they should ask
for mandamus?
MR. KEDEM:

The preconditions for

22

mandamus are, first of all, that you have to

23

show clear entitlement to the writ, which

24

Respondents can't show, in part, because the

25

district court complied with the Ninth

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

Circuit's existing precedent and with precedent

2

of this Court.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Wouldn't he have -­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But is that -- is

5

that definite?

I mean, is it -- is it the case

6

that -- that where, for example, nobody ever

7

thought anybody would do anything like this -­

8

MR. KEDEM:

Well -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- to a prisoner, but

10

they do something really terrible, but it isn't

11

absolutely clear.

12

because it isn't absolutely clear, there's no

13

remedy whatsoever.

14

And now you're saying

MR. KEDEM:

Is that what you're saying?
Let me push back just a

15

little bit, Justice Breyer, on the premise of

16

your question.

in district courts all around the country.

18

It's a practice in roughly half of the U.S.

something truly exceptional.

I'm still trying to

get an answer.

6

MR. KEDEM:

So -- so -­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Many cases are not

8

absolutely clear.

9

you're telling me is there is no remedy.

10

And I want to be sure what

MR. KEDEM:

So, in a case where a

11

litigant can't show or even allege prejudice, I

12

think it would be very difficult to get a

13

remedy.

14

claim from any number of hundreds of different

15

decisions that a district court makes

16

throughout the course of litigation, which are

17

very difficult to get review of.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that doesn't differentiate this

But, Mr. -- Mr. Kedem,

19

I think that the question that's being asked of

20

you is there are a set of -- of claims,

21

potentially, that would not have anything to do

22

with the outcome of a trial or the outcome of a

23

sentencing or even the outcome of a pretrial

24

proceeding but would implicate a person's

25

interest in liberty.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

And, you know, whether you want to do,

2

you know, shackling or we've had claims that

3

have to do with forced medication or excessive

4

bail.

5

of a criminal proceeding but don't have

6

anything to do with the outcomes of that

7

proceeding, just have to do with independent

8

liberty interests that are implicated in that

9

proceeding.

All of these things arise in the context

10

And what I think people are asking you

11

is it seems harsh to say that there's really no

12

way of presenting those claims.

13

MR. KEDEM:

So I take the point,

14

Justice Kagan, but that is not the due process

15

interest that Respondents have invoked

16

throughout this litigation.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I take that point, but

18

it seems as though Respondents have changed

19

their minds a little bit.

20

MR. KEDEM:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22
23

So, I mean -­

Sure.
-- I think that that's

the interest that they're now asserting.
MR. KEDEM:

Right.

So I would say

24

that nearly everything that a district court

25

does is designed to serve multiple interests,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

not just adjudicating guilt or innocence, but

2

promoting values such as the autonomy and

3

dignity of the litigants, promoting respect for

4

the judicial process and the rule of law.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

MR. KEDEM:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8
9
10

Could a detainee -­

If he were able -­
Could a detainee in

this situation bring a civil action?
MR. KEDEM:

So -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Just as a detainee

11

could challenge conditions of confinement in a

12

civil action?

13

MR. KEDEM:

I think if what they were

14

challenging was, in fact, just the liberty

15

component, abstracted away from anything

16

related to the way that their criminal

17

proceedings actually unfold, then they might be

18

able to bring a civil suit.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you would -­

All right.

But that

20

seems -- I mean, I don't know another case

21

where we've said that the collateral-order

22

doctrine rides on whether you have a way of

23

bringing the same claim in an entirely separate

24

proceeding.

25

You know, here, something's happening

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

to you in the criminal process, and you're

2

saying, your brief said, oh, no worries, just

3

go file a civil class action.

4

like a requirement that we've never

5

countenanced before.

6

MR. KEDEM:

But that seems

That's correct.

But the

7

reason is because no litigant has ever claimed

8

that their claim has nothing to do with the way

9

that their proceedings unfolded -­

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, your answer -­
Well, suppose -­
-- your answer to

13

Judge Alito indicated to me that you have some

14

doubt whether the civil class action could

15

work.

16

MR. KEDEM:

Justice Kennedy -­

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would you agree that

18

if prisoners who were still in the pretrial

19

phase of the proceedings brought a class

20

action, and their case later becomes moot -­

21

brought a civil class action, a civil class

22

action -- and their case later becomes moot,

23

that it would still be an existing class,

24

because new people would be in the class, would

25

the government object to that class action on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

grounds that it's an improper class action?

2

MR. KEDEM:

No.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's a problem

4

for these people with a class action, isn't

5

there, because they are being represented by

6

the federal defender.

7

I understand it, by statute may not bring a

8

class action.

9

MR. KEDEM:

10

The federal defender, as

That's correct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And these people

11

are not likely to have the wherewithal to hire

12

counsel on their own.

13

class action remedy is more imaginary than

14

real.

15

MR. KEDEM:

So it seems that the

I disagree, Justice

16

Ginsburg.

There's no suggestion that they

17

wouldn't be able to get pro bono counsel if

18

what they're challenging is a general

19

district-wide policy.

I'm sorry, how do

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there an

entitlement to attorney's fees if the class

action is successful?

MR. KEDEM:

I think that they -- they

might be entitled to attorney's fees.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

even have to be pro bono counsel, right?

10

MR. KEDEM:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it doesn't

Not necessarily.
Counsel, I -- I,

12

frankly, have never heard of a class action

13

that would interfere with the -- with a pending

14

case, as this one appears it might be trying to

15

do.

16

Part of the claim here is that there's

17

an automatic shackling and that district courts

18

are not, pursuant to the -- to the statute,

19

giving individualized consideration to whether

20

people should be released or not.

21
22
23

That second issue will not be
susceptible to class treatment of any kind.
MR. KEDEM:

That's correct.

And the

24

reason that I was somewhat hesitant in

25

referring to the -- to the possibility of a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

civil suit was I think you have to make sure

2

that what the civil suit is challenging is the

3

general policy and not some case-specific

4

decision.

5

But I took the premise of -­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it's only a

7

partial -- it's only a partial solution to this

8

problem?

9

MR. KEDEM:

That's right.

But if the

10

Court is concerned that there's a policy that

11

generally applies that would never have

12

appellate review -- and I took that to be the

13

premise of Justice Kagan's question -- then

14

that's what a civil suit would respond to.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

How?

Who do you sue?

16

And -- I mean, it's not a 1983 action.

Fine, but what is the

A Bivens action?

MR. KEDEM:

cause of action, as this Court recognized in

JUSTICE BREYER:

a Bivens action?
MR. KEDEM:

It's -- it's an Ex parte

Young type of action.
JUSTICE BREYER:

So the lawsuit hasn't

21

been brought before.

And if it unfortunately,

22

perhaps, or fortunately -- look, the Court has

23

held we're not creating new Bivens actions.

Well -­
Let me go back to

16

the collateral -- collateral order, because it

17

seems to me that really does fit this.

18

totally to the side of guilt or innocence of

19

the claim.

20
21
22

It's

So it's -- it's discrete.

I don't see why the collateral order
wouldn't -- wouldn't fit.
MR. KEDEM:

So, in response to -- to

23

the first thing that you said, the Rules

24

Enabling Act allows this Court to make rules,

25

not just in the civil context, but in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

appellate and criminal contexts as well.

2

But to your question about why the

3

collateral-order doctrine doesn't apply, I want

4

you to imagine, for instance, a criminal

5

defendant who wants to represent himself, and

6

he says:

7

affect the outcome of the proceedings.

8

fact, I'm willing to stipulate that it

9

absolutely will not.

10

I know that this is not likely to
In

However, I have a liberty, autonomy,

11

and dignitary interest in being able to

12

represent myself, and those are values I can't

13

get back if I'm forced to go to final judgment

14

and appeal after the fact.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there any reason

16

why we would have to address the question of

17

statutory jurisdiction if there's no Article

18

III jurisdiction?

19

MR. KEDEM:

No.

Mootness would be

20

probably the most straightforward way to

21

resolve the question.

22
23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I -- can I just

ask you to finish what you were saying?

24

MR. KEDEM:

Sure.

You -- you have this hypothetical.

2

MR. KEDEM:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4
5

Sure.
And what would we do

with a case like that?
MR. KEDEM:

Well, my point is that

6

there's nothing that differentiates the

7

dignitary and autonomy and liberty interests

8

that Respondents are asserting from similar

9

interests that could be asserted.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I know.

left me hanging.

12

MR. KEDEM:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure.
Because it seems to me

14

that he should have a way -­

15

MR. KEDEM:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17
18

But it just

Right.
-- of -- of getting

that claim, you know, thought about.
MR. KEDEM:

I think this Court has

19

recognized that because the final judgment rule

20

has its most ardent application in the criminal

21

context, that it is extraordinarily reluctant

22

to undermine the authority of the district

23

judge to cause disruption, to invite

24

gamesmanship from litigants who want to press

25

pause on -- on their proceedings while they get

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

an appeal, that it is extremely reluctant to

2

allow a mid-stream interlocutory appeal.

3

And remember that Respondents have

4

been conspicuously silent about what should

5

happen during this course of this appeal,

6

whether they have to stop all the proceedings.

7

But if what they're really arguing is

8

that these are interests I can't get back if

9

I'm forced to wait, then it strongly seems to

10

suggest that you would have to halt all the

11

proceedings.

12

And I think it's very hard to imagine

13

a case like Stack about bail claims coming out

14

the same way if every time someone wanted to

15

challenge bail, a denial of bail on appeal, you

16

had to pause the underlying criminal

17

proceedings.

18

There are other differences between

19

the cases that this Court has recognized under

20

the collateral-order doctrine as well.

21

First of all, going to the nature of

22

the right, the right that Respondents have

23

invoked -- and I understand that they've

24

changed their argument a little bit -- but

25

throughout this litigation, they have invoked

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

the right under -- under Deck versus Missouri,

2

which is a right that's grounded in the

3

fairness and accuracy of the underlying

4

proceedings.

5

claim.

6

That's very different from a bail

A bail claim, also, as Justice Jackson

7

emphasized in his concurrence in Stack, it's

8

the sort of thing that you never have to stop

9

the underlying proceedings in order to review

10
11

on appeal.
And, it -- it's also distinct from

12

claims like this Court has recognized in Sell

13

versus United States, where the severity of the

14

physical interest was completely different.

15

In Sell versus United States, which

16

concerned the forcible administration of

17

antipsychotic medication, the argument there

18

was it's such a severe intrusion on my personal

19

integrity that you can never order this against

20

my will, no matter what.

21

Respondents' argument is the same restraints

22

that can be applied against me in the detention

23

center, as I'm being transported to the

24

courthouse, being held in a cell within the

25

courthouse, and being transported to the

Whereas, here,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

courthouse door nevertheless have to be taken

2

off of me during the course of my hearing

3

within the courtroom.

4
5

Now that's a completely different
order of magnitude.

6

If the Court has no further questions

7

about the collateral-order doctrine, moving on

8

to the question of mootness, as I said, I think

9

this is probably the most straightforward way

10

for the Court to resolve the case for -­

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about the

12

voluntary cessation doesn't moot the case -­

13

now this rule is no longer in effect.

14

MR. KEDEM:

That's correct.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- but there's

16

many situations in which voluntary cessation

17

does not moot a case.

18

MR. KEDEM:

That's correct.

We -- we

19

are not arguing that the case is moot as a

20

result of the voluntary cessation, and the

21

reason is because the policy was ended here as

22

a direct consequence of the Ninth Circuit panel

23

ruling.

24

moot because Respondents' criminal cases ended,

25

no Respondent took an appeal, and for that

We are instead saying that the case is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

reason, there was no live controversy with

2

respect to their due process claims.

3

Now the Ninth Circuit in its en banc

4

ruling said that the reason that the case is

5

not moot is because it was a functional class

6

action.

7

that argument here.

8
9

Respondents have entirely abandoned

They rest instead on the exception to
mootness for cases that are capable of

10

repetition yet evading review.

11

is that some of Respondents are reasonably

12

likely to commit future crimes, to get caught,

13

to be prosecuted within the Southern District

14

again, and then to be forced to undergo

15

physical restraints again.

16

Their argument

But this Court has consistently

17

refused to allow a litigant to keep a

18

controversy alive by making a prediction of his

19

own future criminality.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -­

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it turned

What about -­

24

in fact, arrested again and did go through the

25

shackling again?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

MR. KEDEM:

That's correct, but it was

2

true in cases such as Lane.

3

have also been true in Spencer versus Kemna.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think it may

What about -- what

5

about Turner, the person who didn't pay, what

6

was it, child support?

7

MR. KEDEM:

Sure.

There were a few

8

differences with Turner.

First of all, that

9

was a case involving civil standards of

10

conduct, not criminal ones.

11

that case, there was an allegation that the

12

litigant had an inability to conform his

13

behavior to the required standards of conduct.

14

He was more than $13,000 in arrears on child

15

support payments with no evident means to pay.

16

Second of all, in

In this case, Respondents make no

17

allegation that they're unable to prevent

18

themselves from committing future crimes.

19

Furthermore -­

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There -- there is

21

something a little bit different with respect

22

to this crime than most.

23

illegal entry crime, and I suspect you, in

24

fact, see extremely high levels of recidivism

25

for that crime because people often have their

I mean, this is an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

families here.

2

people continue to try to get into the country.

3

So it's not uncommon that

MR. KEDEM:

That's -- that's right.

4

But this Court has never relied solely on

5

probabilities.

6

another distinction is that what was being

7

challenged there was the right of the court to

8

apply those standards to the litigant.

9

other words, the litigant's argument was you

10

cannot apply civil contempt against me under

11

these circumstances because I don't have a

12

right to an attorney and I have no evident

13

means to -- to pay.

The point is, in Turner,

In

14

Here, there's no argument that the

15

rule prohibiting -- the -- the criminal law

16

prohibiting reentering the country illegally

17

can't be applied to Respondents.

18

that's never been their argument, and that

19

isn't their argument here.

20

That's -­

And this Court has consistently be -­

21

been unwilling to assume that litigants will

22

flout laws that they concede to be valid and,

23

in fact, has assumed the opposite is true.

collateral order?
MR. KEDEM:

It's under the

collateral-order doctrine.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why is this

different?
MR. KEDEM:
in a few respects.

So I think it's different
First of all -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

You've said -- you've

said several times, but if you would just
summarize the main reasons why it's different.
MR. KEDEM:

Sure.

So, first of all,

12

bail is not a decision about courtroom

13

procedure.

14

that happen only outside of the courtroom.

15

And the reason that that matters,

By definition, it affects things

16

Justice Breyer, is because the collateral-order

17

doctrine is based on the premise that there are

18

certain orders that can be decided immediately

19

on appeal without having to know anything about

20

the way that the case unfolds.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I got that point, but

22

the -- the analogy that I was thinking of is

23

after all, you deny bail, the person's liberty

24

is constrained, he is in a cell.

25

MR. KEDEM:

Right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, here, the

2

person's liberty is constrained.

He is in a

3

shackle.

4

And -- but the difference, you say, is you can

5

continue with the proceedings.

And both are fairly important to him.

6

MR. KEDEM:

So that -- that was the

7

difference Justice Jackson emphasized.

8

another difference as well, which is that, for

9

a bail claim, the interest at stake is far more

10

substantial.

11

litigant will be -­

12
13

We're talking about whether the

JUSTICE BREYER:
there.

There's

Well, I don't know

I mean -­

14

MR. KEDEM:

Well -­

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- there the person's

16

in a cell and here the person's in physical

17

shackles.

18

MR. KEDEM:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20
21

Right.

But the -­

I -- I'm not sure

about that.
MR. KEDEM:

The difference, though, is

22

with a bail claim, you're talking about whether

23

the litigant will be at liberty or behind bars

24

for the entire duration of their criminal

25

proceedings, which could be weeks or possibly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

even months.

2

Here, we're talking about individual

3

hearings which last minutes or possibly hours.

4

So I think it is a very different -- the

5

difference is -- is pretty significant.

6

And, similarly, we -- we think, the

7

nature of the right is very different.

Again,

8

I understand that they've changed a little bit

9

what they're conceiving of the right as, but

10

the right that they've invoked under Deck

11

versus Missouri is a right about accuracy and

12

fairness, and that's very different from the

13

bail right.

14

If there are no further questions, I'd

15

like to reserve the balance of my time.

16

you.

Thank

Thank you,

Mr. Cahn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF REUBEN C. CAHN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CAHN:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
When a district court takes the
extraordinary step of shackling every defendant

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

at every pretrial proceeding taking place over

2

a period of months, courts of appeals have

3

authority to review those actions under either

4

the collateral-order doctrine or via

5

extraordinary writ.

6

Now collateral order review under

7

Cohen exists because the decisions here

8

conclusively determine an important question

9

that was entirely separate from the merits,

10

having nothing to do with the guilt or

11

innocence of these particular Respondents.

12

it was effectively unreviewable on appeal from

13

a final judgment.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could -- could you

15

speak to the government's view that this is

16

kind of a new theory for you?

17

MR. CAHN:

And

Well, I think the

18

government's simply wrong.

19

court on, we argued this as a deprivation of

20

liberty under the Due Process Clause.

21

From the district

The district court chose to address it

22

as a Fourth Amendment violation, but that was

23

not our theory.

24

decided this as a deprivation of liberty.

25

They're quite clear about that.

The Ninth Circuit, of course,

They talk

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

about Youngberg versus Romeo and that this is a

2

deprivation of the fundamental right to be free

3

of restraints.

4

Now we've talked about Deck because

5

Deck talks about what goes on in the courtroom.

6

And the Court said that in Deck, that right,

7

that liberty interest, protects other rights,

8

including the presumption of innocence, the

9

right to consult with counsel and participate

10

in one's own defense, and, of course, the

11

dignity and decorum of the court and the -­

12
13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

that was during -- shackling during trial?

14
15

But that was -­

MR. CAHN:

Yes, it was during the

penalty phase of a capital case, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

suggestion by Mr. Kedem that if the

19

collateral-order doctrine were available, that

20

would mean that the criminal proceeding would

21

be stopped in its tracks.

22

that?

23

MR. CAHN:

What about their -­
There was a -- a

Do you agree with

I think that's just wrong.

24

I mean, there's no stay as a matter of right in

25

these cases.

In every case, if somebody wanted

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

a stay, then they'd have to make that decision,

2

because, of course, these individuals are

3

individuals not who are detained but who simply

4

couldn't afford bail.

5

So they are in jail while this is

6

happening.

And it's up to them to make a

7

decision whether to ask for a stay, and it's up

8

for the district court in the first instance to

9

decide whether or not it's proper, and then the

10

court of appeals in the second instance,

11

whether or not to allow a stay under equitable

12

principles.

13

And I don't think -- if you look at

14

this case, in none of these cases did the

15

individuals ask for a stay of proceedings for

16

just that reason.

17

They were already in jail.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the government

18

has said, I think, if I interpret it correctly,

19

that, of course, you have a right to challenge

20

this policy.

21

can do it.

22

But there are three ways that you

One way is when you appeal a

23

conviction, the person says:

And one other

24

thing that hurt me in this process was the

25

shackle before the magistrate.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

The second way is, if this is an

2

extreme case, you're entitled to mandamus.

3

he thinks it's not an extreme case.

4

But

The third way is you get your client

5

and, with a group of others, you bring an Ex

6

parte Young action, which is actually the most

7

straightforward, and you challenge the policy

8

against the Marshals Service and you say just

9

what you've said.

10

So I guess now my question is going

11

the opposite of where I was, is why not use one

12

of those three?

13

three, one of them should work because, of

14

course, you should have a method of challenging

15

the policy.

16
17
18

At least if you brought all

MR. CAHN:

Well, let me see if I can

-- if I can hit those seriatim quickly.
So, in the first instance, this Court

19

has said in Arizona versus Fulminante that when

20

one attacks a final judgment of conviction

21

seeking to overturn the -- the final judgment

22

of conviction, the court will do that only for

23

two reasons:

24

in the presentation of the case to the finder

25

of fact, and the other is in cases of

One for trial error that occurs

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

structural error having to do with the

2

constitution of the trial process.

3

of this right doesn't seem to fit into either

4

of those categories.

5

Deprivation

The second suggestion, I believe, was

6

the class action suggestion.

And I note that

7

this Court has never said that the availability

8

of some right -- or some forum to pursue

9

litigation outside of the instant proceeding

10

was relevant to collateral-order jurisdiction

11

or to mandamus, and I'd point to both Stack and

12

Sell as being contrary to that.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In Stack -­

I don't wish to

14

interrupt the seriatim because -- but are -­

15

are -- is there any doubt that you as a public

16

defender could bring a civil class action?

17
18

MR. CAHN:

It's in my mind quite

unclear.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

MR. CAHN:

All right.

So I -- and I'm not an

21

expert on civil class actions and it's

22

something that we're just unclear about based

23

upon the statute and the rules.

24
25

But in Stack and Sell -- in Stack,
this Court specifically said that the bringing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

of a separate habeas action in that case was

2

improper.

3

In Sell, Justice Scalia in his dissent

4

suggested that the forced medication order

5

could have been challenged in another

6

proceeding, an Administrative Procedure Act

7

challenge, to the order of the Bureau of

8

Prisons to medicate the individual there.

9

And what the -- the Court said that

10

wasn't relevant to the availability of

11

collateral-order jurisdiction in that case.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, all of

13

these difficulties that you're mentioning,

14

you'll have the benefit in all these that the

15

2

alternatives.

3

that -- it's certainly clear that we couldn't

do this after final judgment, despite what

5

they've said.

mandamus, and I think this is an exceptional

7

case, as this Court has set it out, because

that we give them when an issue is super

doesn't that take care of your problem?
MR. CAHN:

Well, the court of appeals

16

did, in fact, go forward on the basis of

17

mandamus jurisdiction.

18

comfortable with that and would be happy if

19

this Court affirmed on the basis of mandamus

20

jurisdiction.

21
22

And we're perfectly

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So mandamus is -- is

available you think in these circumstances?

23

MR. CAHN:

Yes.

24

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

25

MR. CAHN:

And not a problem?

We think it's -- it's a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

2

viable route to get review of these matters.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did the -- did the

3

three judge panel -- they didn't -- they didn't

4

go on mandamus, did they?

5

MR. CAHN:

No, there was established

6

precedent in the Ninth Circuit that

7

collateral-order jurisdiction existed to review

8

this sort of claim, and the Ninth Circuit found

9

-- and the Ninth Circuit panel found collateral

10
11

-order jurisdiction.
The court of appeals said that:

We're

12

going to leave that precedent undisturbed, but

13

because we're not going to address the

14

individual shackling decisions, we're only

15

going to address the policy, we see mandamus as

16

a better route to get at that.

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, the -- the

18

government suggests that the functional class

19

action theory to get around the mootness

20

problem you've abandoned.

21

characterization?

22

MR. CAHN:

Is that a fair

So I -- I don't know that

23

I'd say we've abandoned it, but we fit squarely

24

within a very clearly established exception to

25

the mootness doctrine, that this matter is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

capable of repetition yet evading review.

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, before we get

3

to that, if I could just -- if you haven't

4

abandoned it, I don't see it briefed.

5

am I supposed to do about that?

6

MR. CAHN:

So what

Well, I think this Court's

7

free to affirm on the basis of the Ninth

8

Circuit's opinion without our briefing on the

9

issue.

10
11
12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:
right?

Do you think it's

You haven't defended it.
MR. CAHN:

Well, this Court did

13

something very similar in Richardson versus

14

Ramirez where there was no certification of a

15

class action and the Court found that wasn't

16

essential to Article III jurisdiction.

17

But because we have a simple, clear

18

route, we don't want to ask this Court to break

19

new ground for us.

20
21
22

So -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

that's helpful right there.
JUSTICE ALITO:

That -­

Thank you.

But you have a

23

decision from the en banc Ninth Circuit saying

24

that this case is not moot based on the fact

25

that it is a functional class action.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

MR. CAHN:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

And it's pretty

3

remarkable that, whether you've abandoned the

4

-- the point or not, you certainly have not

5

made any effort to defend it.

6

MR. CAHN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

What does that say

8

about this theory, which is adopted by the -­

9

the en -- an en banc court of appeals?

10

MR. CAHN:

Well, as to us, it says

11

that we're more comfortable staying within a

12

firmly established exception to mootness that

13

this Court has ruled on many times.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it -- it isn't,

15

because capable of repetition, evasive review,

16

I don't know of any case that has allowed:

17

going to do it again, that I'm a recidivist,

18

therefore, I mean, it will be evasive of review

19

because I'll do it again and again.

20

know any decision that allows you to say:

21

will commit the same offense again, therefore,

22

the case isn't moot.

23

MR. CAHN:

I'm

I don't
I

Well, let me note that in

24

Gerstein in Footnote 11, this Court said that

25

pretrial detention is necessarily brief,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

speaking to the individual named plaintiffs, so

2

that no one individual would have an

3

opportunity to fully litigate their claim.

4

yet the individual could suffer repeated

5

deprivations, making the matter capable of

6

repetition yet evading review.

7

And

So this -- beyond that, I'd point that

8

-- point out that the Article III personal

9

stake requirement is no different for a

10

criminal defendant than a civil plaintiff or a

11

civil defendant.

12

And what this Court has always looked

13

to is whether there's a reasonable expectation

14

or a reasonable likelihood as a factual matter

15

based upon the facts in the particular case

16

involving the particular litigants.

17

It's not a rule that's intended to

18

control the conduct of litigants outside of the

19

courtroom.

Court to determine whether or not there remains

21

a live controversy that can be appropriately

22

decided in this Court.

23

It's simply a rule that allows this

JUSTICE BREYER:

So we're -- at the

24

moment, it's very interesting and helpful, but

25

I'm thinking if we -- if we -- if we go with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

you on mootness, I don't know what door that's

2

opening up because it's really not moot because

3

there are other people that will be subjected

4

to it, not your clients.

5

Then I'm thinking:

Well, if we go on

6

the mandamus, I'm going to hear just what I

7

heard, that there are a bunch of districts that

8

have this and it isn't as far out as my

9

imaginary example.

10

And then, if I go on collateral order,

11

I'm going to run into the problem that we just

12

said, that this would delay the proceeding

13

rather than his like being in bail.

14

they say:

15

that's fine.

16

And then

But bring an Ex parte Young action,

And -- and how long would that take?

17

I mean, you find five people down there who are

18

going to be subject to it, and you go into

19

20

are, we win.

Okay.

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, they say Ex

5

MR. CAHN:

They say that, but, you

6

know, the truth is that doesn't obtain review

7

of the decisions to shackle these individuals

8

in their cases.

9

already said -- I mean, speaking of O'Shea,

And, of course, this Court has

10

this Court said in O'Shea that it's certainly

11

not a favored course of action to enter

12

injunctions that will interfere with the

13

conduct of criminal cases.

14

In the normal way, the appropriate way

15

of reviewing decisions in individual criminal

16

cases has always been through appeals in those

17

individual criminal cases.

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the difference

between -- what -- what is the difference

20

between a case involving allegedly unlawful

21

shackling when a person is brought to a

22

proceeding in court where there is no jury, on

collateral-order doctrine?

5

MR. CAHN:

Well -­
In -- in the latter

No, I -- I don't believe so

6

because courts don't make decisions in criminal

cases about what happens in detention centers.

after a conviction.

One is that it has some effect on

But if the claim is, irrespective of

any effect on the criminal case, this is a

violation of my constitutional rights because

it violates a -- a liberty interest, a

22

dignitary interest, then explain to me what is

23

the difference between those two situations.

24

It's just the happenstance that one occurs in

25

court and one occurs across the street in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

jail?
MR. CAHN:

Well, we think the fact

3

that it occurs in court is meaningful.

I mean,

4

it is -- you know, we -- we believe the

5

courtroom really is a sacred space.

6

judges control that space and -- and assure

7

that individuals come before the court with

8

dignity and with autonomy and with their

9

liberty interest protected, and that there was

We believe

10

a well-established right at common law that,

11

under this Court's precedents, is incorporated

12

in the Due Process Clause to appear before

13

courts free of bonds.

14

And this happened regularly at the

15

common law, individuals would come from prison

16

17

shackled hand and foot, and without question,

18

their bonds would be struck off for their

arraignments.

20

is the safety of those in the courtroom and the

And your scenario of the

Here, according to the -- the -- the

2

record from the marshals, you have many

3

situations where there are a lot of people, and

the idea that they're going to undertake an

5

individualized determination in every case is

6

just something that they don't have the

Well, I disagree and I

followed since May of 2017 in the district that

what happens today is that they come and they

tell the lawyer:

19

the lawyer can either decide to challenge that

before the judge or not as they choose to.

according to what the marshals say, there are

many people in the courtroom, or waiting to get

All I can say is this is done day in

14

MR. CAHN:

But it's very

Well, let me be clear,

15

we're not asking the Court to presume anything,

16

and that's simply because the most likely

17

evidence that something can happen is that it

18

has happened.

19

something -- or the most probative evidence

20

that something is likely to reoccur is that it

21

already has.

22

The most likely evidence that

And this dispute between Respondents

23

and the government has already repeated itself,

24

so it's not merely a probability, it's not

25

merely a presumption or an assumption, but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

there's actual facts that show it's likely

2

to reoccur.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but that

4

suggests if I look at somebody and he has a

5

very, very, very long rap sheet, I'd say, well,

6

you know, he clearly does this every month,

7

he's just going to be here again, and give him

8

a different rule from somebody who's a first

9

offender.

10

MR. CAHN:

Well, the Court has always

11

said that in applying the capable of repetition

12

yet evading review exception, the court looks

13

at the individual case and the individual

14

litigant in determining whether or not it's

15

likely to repeat itself.

16

So the Court isn't creating some rule

17

for all criminal cases in some way, courts

18

looking at these cases.

19

there's also one other Respondent who I think

20

is relevant to this consideration because the

21

government's made the argument, though I think

22

it's wrong, that both Mr. Smith in Honig versus

23

Doe and -- and -- and Mr. Turner in the -- in

24

the Turner versus Rogers were unable to avoid

25

coming back in -- into that situation.

I mean, let me note

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

But we have an individual here,

2

Mr. Ring, the Respondent, the disabled Iraqi

3

combat vet, who has chronic and severe PTSD,

4

causing him to overperceive and overreact to

5

threats, and it's as a result of that that he

6

came into conflict with the VA, where he lives

7

in a VA home and relies on the VA for services.

8

So I think there's also that individual who is

9

likely to come into that same conflict.

10

And the other thing I'd point out is

11

that these individuals, when they come back

12

into court, they are indeed presumed innocent.

13

So the government says we're asking you to say

14

that they are going to commit new crimes.

are not simply from Blackstone, but almost all

of them are from American courts, and the

conclusion is trial courts -- that what they

but before district court judges in substantive

that Blackstone wasn't talking just about jury

7

cases.

comes from his chapter of arraignment and its

incidents.

The very quote that's mentioned in Deck

And it talks about the arraignment,

10

about coming into court, being called to the

11

bar, asked to state one's true name, and being

12

informed of the charges and asked to plead.

And Blackstone states the rule was

that individuals were to appear free of bonds

But in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Central District -­

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

MR. CAHN:

Before the state.

In the Central District of

4

California, there was a policy of using leg

5

shackles only in the initial appearances only,

6

and that was the Howard case, which was the

7

begin -- the first litigation ever concerning

8

shackling that established the right to

9

collateral-order jurisdiction in the circuit on

10
11

-- over these matters.
JUSTICE ALITO:

If -- if there is no

12

rule, there's no blanket rule, but an

13

individual district judge orders that a

14

detainee be shackled, do you think that could

15

be contested via the collateral-order doctrine?

16

MR. CAHN:

Well, I think the only

17

thing before this Court is a complete denial of

18

an individual determination on the basis of

19

violence or risk of escape.

20

clearly a due process violation and subject to

21

the collateral-order doctrine.

22

And so that is

The Court did say in Stack that

23

there's a distinction between the discretionary

24

calls that a judge makes in setting the amount

25

of bond versus the refusal to reduce an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

excessive bond.

2

could -- could construct the jurisdictional

3

rule in that manner.

4

And so the Court could -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

But here there could

5

be -- you could get an individualized

6

determination, could you not?

7

I thought under this rule any judge could order

8

that the shackles be removed.

9

MR. CAHN:

Couldn't -- I -­

Any judge could order that

10

the shackles be removed, but no judge made an

11

individual determination on the basis of danger

12

or risk of escape.

13

times and were told again and again and again

14

you're not going to get that, you don't have a

15

right to that.

16

And we asked for it many

Some judges said we'll consider

17

medical extremity in determining whether or not

18

we'll remove shackles in whole or in part.

19

the record is really clear and the Ninth

20

Circuit en banc found that there was really

21

very little variance and there was no

22

individualization in a meaningful way, that

23

this was a blanket -­

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, going

But

back to what the Ninth Circuit said in their

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

majority opinion, they didn't deal with the

2

mootness issue except through the class action

3

argument.

4

MR. CAHN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They do state in

6

their opinion, however, the principle that was

7

mentioned earlier, that we generally don't

8

presume in their case law that someone will

9

commit a criminal act.

10

The government points to that -­

11

MR. CAHN:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -- So -­
-- in saying,

13

absent the class action mechanism, you really

14

can't get past that circuit case law -­

15

MR. CAHN:

So -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- if -- if -- it

17

seems to me that shouldn't we let the Ninth

18

Circuit figure that out?

19

MR. CAHN:

Well -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we don't accept

21

the class action mechanism they use -- it's a

22

big but, it -- hypothetically, if we don't

23

accept that, shouldn't we just remand and let

24

them decide whether this is capable of

25

repetition or not?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

MR. CAHN:

So I -- I certainly think

2

that this Court has done that in the past in

3

its appropriate course.

4

happened here was that no one in front of the

5

court of appeals contend -- contended that the

6

matter was moot because the Respondents had

7

lost their personal stake.

8
9

What's -- what

And so the Ninth Circuit was never
made aware of the underlying facts, including

10

many facts that are in the record, there -- all

11

of the facts concerning Mr. Ring and Mr.

12

Sanchez-Gomez are in the record, but they

13

weren't litigated, they weren't brought before

14

the court, because neither the government nor

15

we contended that Respondents had lost their

16

personal stake.

17

And it just wasn't discussed.

So it would certainly be appropriate

18

to remand to the Ninth Circuit for them to make

19

an initial determination.

20

The other thing I'd say is I want to

21

come back a little bit to O'Shea and the

22

government.

23

on the idea that this Court has said that it's

24

never appropriate to consider the possibility

25

that an individual will come back into court in

The government's pushing very hard

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

a criminal case.

2

the doctrine doesn't apply in criminal cases.

3

And the Court has never said

And, in fact, the language in Gerstein

4

is directly to the contrary of the rule, the

5

new rule that the government is suggesting this

6

Court adopt.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

And do you think we

8

could say:

Well, we don't know whether we have

9

jurisdiction under the Constitution, but we're

10

going to write an opinion on various other

11

interesting legal issues that are presented in

12

this case?

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. CAHN:

15

Your Honor.

No, I don't believe so,

I don't believe that's possible.

16

Let me -­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

something?

19

20

No.

May -- may I ask

It might -- it's probably not
I'm just curious about it.

At -- at -- at some point, why didn't

21

one of the lawyers in your office pick up the

22

phone -- there are a host of organizations that

23

I can imagine bringing a suit like this one

24

outside of any individual criminal case -- why

25

didn't that call get made to one of those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65

organizations?

2

MR. CAHN:

Well, there's no evidence

3

in the record about this, Your Honor.

But

4

since -- if I might, there -- there has been -­

5

we've had this and other issues that have come

6

up where we felt that it would be appropriate

7

to litigate them through class actions, many of

8

which have never led to challenges because we

9

thought they could only be brought through

10

class actions or civil litigation.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

MR. KEDEM:

Thank you.

I have a

21

number of individual points, but I think it's

22

worth pausing to just acknowledge the breadth

23

of Respondents' argument.

24
25

Respondents' argument is that every
single decision to use restraints in any

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

criminal case, and possibly other case

2

management decisions as well, can get an

3

interlocutory appeal, that compliance with

4

circuit precedent by a district court qualifies

5

for mandamus relief, and that, under Article

6

III, a litigant can point to his likelihood of

7

committing a future crime in order to keep his

8

case live.

9

Starting first with the question of

10

mootness, my friend several times brought up

11

Gerstein as an application of the exception for

12

cases capable of repetition yet evading review.

13

It was not.

14

Gerstein was based on the fact that

15

there was a certified class action there.

16

There is no certified class action here.

17

makes a difference because a class has its own

18

interests that continues even after the

19

individual litigant's is over.

20

It

Respondents have said that it's just a

21

prediction based on general likelihood,

22

probability, that a future crime will be

23

committed.

24

those sorts of predictions and in cases like

25

O'Shea, Lane, and Spencer, has explicitly said

This Court has never relied on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

that a prediction of that sort is not

2

permissible.

3

Finally, he brought up Mr. Ring.

At

4

no point during this litigation, not even at

5

the merits stage before this Court, has

6

Respondents ever suggested that Mr. Ring is

7

likely to commit another crime.

8
9

Going now to the question of the
collateral-order doctrine.

Justice Kennedy,

10

you have several times asked a question:

11

Couldn't you have this -- this issue come up in

12

the context of a suppression ruling?

13

The answer is yes.

And that would

14

survive final judgment.

15

challenged on appeal, even if the litigant was

16

convicted or even if he pleaded guilty.

17
18
19
20
21

That could be

So there's no reason why you can't
challenge that as a result from final judgment.
Moving next to the question about
Justice Kennedy -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Assuming your

22

district, like most, doesn't have a waiver of

23

appeal rights with all of their plea

24

agreements.

25

MR. KEDEM:

It's routine -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Which it's routine

to have the -­

3

MR. KEDEM:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

which means this issue is not likely.

6

MR. KEDEM:

Sure.
-- the waiver,

Well, it's routine for

7

litigants to preserve suppression objections

8

and to challenge that on appeal.

9

something that happens all of the time.

10

That's

And there's no reason that that

11

couldn't happen in a case where someone

12

alleges, for instance, that they were unable to

13

contribute to their own defense, that they

14

couldn't write notes or get the attention of

15

their attorney, as Respondents have alleged

16

here.

17

Justice -- Justice Kagan, you asked

18

about whether this was a new theory.

And my

19

friend said we've been arguing all along that

20

there's a liberty interest.

21

true.

22

context of the common law right under Deck

23

versus Missouri, which is the right that

24

they've been invoking throughout this

25

litigation at all stages, including before this

That is completely

But it's a liberty interest within the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1
2

Court.
There was a question about whether

3

this is truly an exceptional case sufficient to

4

justify mandamus.

5

Marshal field offices, and our understanding is

6

about half of them use restraints at all

7

initial appearances, about 150 out of the 300

8

field offices.

9
10
11
12

We did a survey of U.S.

Another 100 or so -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that -- is that

five-point restraints?
MR. KEDEM:

That's full restraints.

13

It's both wrist restraints and also leg

14

restraints.

Another 100 or so use only leg

15

restraints.

And then about 50 field offices

16

don't have any restraints at initial

17

appearances.

18
19
20

So the Ninth Circuit is actually very
much the outlier here.
Furthermore, my friend brought up the

21

idea -- brought up the Schlagenhauf case.

22

Schlagenhauf, the argument was that a type of

23

order that had never been issued before, an

24

order requiring the criminal defendant to

25

undergo a battery of psychological and mental

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was a civil

case, wasn't it?

4

MR. KEDEM:

That was a civil case.

5

That was a mandamus case.

6

Ginsburg, as you might be pointing to, this

7

Court has never recognized an appropriate use

8

of mandamus in a criminal case where the order

9

sought to be challenged was not the functional

10

Finally, back to the collateral-order

doctrine.

13

interests.

14

15

17

18

The doctrine is a balancing of
Everyone recognizes that it is

But we also recognize that it can

It's incredibly disruptive, it invites

19

gamesmanship, and it undermines the authority

20

of the district judge.

21

about a type of order, the use of restraints,

22

that happens hundreds of times in district

23

court cases all around the country.

24
25

We're talking here

And because they're trying to abstract
out the part of their argument related only to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71
1

dignitary interests or autonomy interests, that

2

argument can't be cabined.

3

essentially any decision that a district court

4

makes regarding some sort of trial procedure,

5

as long as you can claim there's no way that

6

it's likely to prejudice me.

It could apply to

7

Usually, the assumption is opposite -­

8

the opposite, that appellate review is there in

9

cases where there is prejudice, and we don't

10

want to change the rules merely because a

11

litigant can claim that there is no prejudice.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you say -- I

13

don't know -- but can you say if the government

14

would -- I don't want to put cooperate, that's

15

too strong -- but at least would not oppose an

16

effort in any of those 150 districts by a

17

defense attorney's organization to try to

18

challenge this policy, either through, as you

19

suggested, an Ex parte Young proceeding or, as

20

you also suggested, an ordinary appeal where

21

they haven't waived the right to appeal and it

22

says explicitly like reserving the -- the

23

suppression motion, we reserve the right to

24

challenge the restraint motion?

25

MR. KEDEM:

Well, starting -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now -- now -- there

-- yeah?

3

MR. KEDEM:

part of your question -­

6

MR. KEDEM:

Yeah.

-- the government didn't

7

in Zuber or LaFond, which were the Second and

8

Eleventh Circuit decisions that were from final

9

judgments, didn't contend there that it was

10

improper for the litigant to argue that they

11

had been improperly restrained in those cases.

12

With respect to your question about

13

the civil suit, I can say only that the

14

government would not oppose it in an

15

appropriate case.
