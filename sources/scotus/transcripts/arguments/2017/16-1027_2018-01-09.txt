ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW A. FITZGERALD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. FITZGERALD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The warrant requirement for the home

12

and curtilage cannot be overthrown by the

13

automobile exception.

14

Under the Commonwealth's argument, on

15

probable cause alone, an officer may search a

16

vehicle anywhere that he finds it and may go

17

anywhere that he needs to in order to access

18

that vehicle.

19

That rule cannot survive foundational

20

Fourth Amendment principles.

Searches of the

21

home and curtilage without a warrant are

22

presumptively unreasonable, as this Court has

23

often recognized.

24

So the rule we ask this Court to adopt

25

is that the automobile exception does not apply

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

to a vehicle found in the curtilage of the

2

home.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose the -- the

4

police have probable cause to believe that the

5

vehicle is stolen and they even get a warrant

6

to inspect the vehicle.

7

parked in this port.

8
9
10

But the vehicle is

Do they need -- do they need a warrant
to go get the car for which they have a
warrant?

11

MR. FITZGERALD:

Well, Your Honor, the

12

-- the warrant would specify the place to be

13

searched for the car.

14

warrant would say, for instance, the dwelling

15

and curtilage to look for this motorcycle.

16

the warrant that authorizes the search of the

17

motorcycle would, by its terms, authorize the

18

intrusion into the curtilage to look for -­

19

And so, commonly, a

JUSTICE ALITO:

So

But what if it didn't?

20

So they have a warrant here, let's say, to

21

search for -- they have probable cause to

22

search this thing covered by a -- a tarp.

23

have a warrant to search this motorcycle

24

because it's been involved in criminal

25

activity.

They want to get the vehicle

4

is here, maybe in the curtilage, maybe not in

5

the curtilage.

Let's say it's parked two feet from the
But arguably -- or it's parked where it

6
7

The -- that warrant would be
insufficient?

8
9

And they see

MR. FITZGERALD:

Well, Your Honor, the

Fourth Amendment, by its terms, requires a

10

warrant to specify the place to be searched.

11

So if they've seen the motorcycle in that spot

12

and they get a warrant, the warrant would say

13

this house on Dellmead Avenue, may have

14

included the picture, and it would, by its

15

terms, authorize the access to that.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

And this is my

17

question about your argument based on the

18

curtilage.

19

within or outside the curtilage in order to

20

determine whether the Fourth Amendment applies

21

at all.

22

We -- we ask whether a search

But that's not really the question

23

here because there is probable cause, and there

24

is the motor vehicle exception to the warrant

25

requirement.

So the issue is not whether there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

was a search.

2

yes, you know, if it -- if it was the

3

curtilage, then there was -- there -- there was

4

an intrusion on the protected area.

5

Yes, there was a search.

And,

But the warrant -- the motor vehicle

6

exception to the warrant requirement, I take

7

it, is based on two things.

8

risk that the vehicle is going to be moved

9

during the time when the warrant is sought and,

10

second, is a consideration on the other side of

11

the risk that if there's not a warrant, the

12

police will be wrong about probable cause and

13

the degree of intrusion on property, on

14

legitimate property interests that occur in

15

that situation.

16

It's a balancing.

One is the -- the

It's not a

17

consideration of whether it's on the curtilage

18

or not.

19

is any different here than it would be if this

20

motorcycle had been parked on the street.

21

-- the risk that it will be moved seems to be

22

almost exactly the same.

23

the additional invasion of privacy?

24

invasion of privacy that's involved in walking

25

a few feet up a driveway, and the home is not

And it's hard to see why the balance

The

And what -- what is
The

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

even Mr. Byrd's home.

Why does the balance

2

come out different here?

3

MR. FITZGERALD:

Well, Your Honor, so

4

here's -- here's the way that I think about

5

that:

6

support the automobile exception, you have

7

ready mobility and you have the lessened

8

expectation of privacy.

If you're looking at the terms that

9

But the curtilage and the home are

10

essentially more important concerns than that.

11

So, for instance, if I had a fistful of cocaine

12

and I'm out in public, cocaine is extremely

13

readily mobile.

14

to dispose of than a fistful of cocaine.

15

I've got a sink, it can be gone in seconds.

16

it's extremely readily mobile.

17

cocaine itself is there any expectation of

18

privacy.

There's nothing that is easier
If
So

Nor in the

It's illegal to possess it already.

19

But if I'm standing in, say, my living

20

room or in my garage with a fistful of cocaine,

21

the Court would require a warrant for the

22

police to come to that address and look for

23

that and get me.

24
25

So -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah -- no, I think

the privacy interests would be quite different

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

if this was in the house or if it was in the

2

garage, but this is not in either of those

3

places.

4

street, right?

5

It's in a spot that's visible from the

MR. FITZGERALD:

It's visible from the

6

street from directly at the end of the

7

driveway, yes, Your Honor.

8

obscured from any distance in either direction

9

by the brick walls that surround where this

It -- it is

10

motorcycle was on three sides, one side being

11

the house.

12

So the motorcycle here is five feet

13

from the side of the house.

14

extent that curtilage is at issue, curtilage

15

has been waived by the Commonwealth by not

16

arguing it below.

17

curtilage, given the distance from the house.

18

So -­

19

And -- and to the

And this is a clear case for

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How much does your

20

argument depend on us viewing this as two

21

things:

22

the curtilage, and then a search within that

23

private space?

24
25

One, a trespass on private property,

Is your argument hinged on that
distinction?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

MR. FITZGERALD:

Well, I think we make

2

that distinction because it's important just to

3

make sense of the Fourth Amendment to think

4

about it step-by-step.

5

searches here.

And there are two

6

The first is the intrusion into the

7

curtilage under Jardines, which is clearly a

8

search outside of any implied license, and the

9

second is the removal of the cover from the

10

motorcycle, which is similar to opening a

11

container to find a vehicle inside or perhaps

12

opening the door to a car or removing a cover

13

from a car.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if this motorcycle

15

were parked on the street and it was covered by

16

a tarp, you would say that the motor vehicle

17

exception doesn't apply because it's covered by

18

a tarp?

19

MR. FITZGERALD:

No, Your Honor.

20

it were parked on the street, then the

21

automobile exception would apply.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23
24
25

If

So what's the

relevance of the tarp?
MR. FITZGERALD:

The relevance of the

tarp is essentially that there is a -- there is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

some expectation of privacy in a tarp,

2

particularly placed within the curtilage of the

3

home.

4

very important here.

So the location of the motorcycle is

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

does it make that the tarp was there?

7

MR. FITZGERALD:

So what difference

The tarp perhaps

8

makes it particularly clear that the officer

9

was undergoing a search, not just, say, walking

10

where he could have said, oh, this is almost on

11

the way -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, let's

13

change the hypothetical.

Is there still a

14

violation under your theory of law if the

15

motorcycle was in plain view in the curtilage

16

and he just walked on to the curtilage and what

17

-- I don't know where the VIN is on the

18

motorcycle, by the way.

19

in a car, it's within the car, not outside the

20

car, so you -­

I don't -- you know,

21

MR. FITZGERALD:

Right.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- have to open

23

the car door.

But let's assume that you have

24

to move something on the motorcycle.

25

know.

I don't

Do you?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

MR. FITZGERALD:

I don't think you

2

would have to move something on the motorcycle.

3

And so -­

4
5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
that.

No -- no top on it.

6

MR. FITZGERALD:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8
9

Let's just assume

So if there -­
Does your argument

still stand?
MR. FITZGERALD:

Yes, Your Honor.

So

10

if the motorcycle is where the motorcycle is in

11

this case but there is no cover on it, there is

12

a Fourth Amendment violation, and that is -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why?

Because,

14

I mean, suppose the policeman is standing on

15

the sidewalk.

16

quite close, and there inside he sees a huge

17

pile of cocaine.

18

He -- the window of the house is

Okay?

I thought, but perhaps I've got it

19

mixed up, I thought that seeing something that

20

is an illegal substance that can be easily

21

disposed of in about three seconds would, in

22

fact, justify, create an exigent circumstance

23

under which the policeman could enter?

24

wrong about that?

25

MR. FITZGERALD:

Am I

Close, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

So if -­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the law

MR. FITZGERALD:

If an officer

3

there?

4
5

standing on the sidewalk looks into the window

6

of a house and sees a pile of drugs through the

7

window -­

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

9

MR. FITZGERALD:

-- that creates

10

probable cause that would permit the officer to

11

get a warrant to go into the house.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, so he goes,

13

gets a warrant, and they throw it all down the

14

sink -­

15

MR. FITZGERALD:

Well, this -­

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and, of course,

17

there is nothing by the time he comes back.

18

mean, I thought that was an example of an

19

exigent circumstance -­

I

20

MR. FITZGERALD:

If -­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- but you know the

22

area of this law better than I do, I -- I

23

guess, and that isn't so.

24
25

MR. FITZGERALD:

So it's not

impossible that there would be an exigent

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

circumstance there.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, no, I've given

3

you the facts.

4

pile of cocaine right there and there's

5

somebody wandering around inside.

6

The facts are there's a big

And -- and can't he -- I don't know,

7

what is an exigent circumstance if it isn't

8

that?

9

MR. FITZGERALD:

It's -- it's

10

particularly important to that hypothetical

11

that there's someone wandering around inside -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

13

MR. FITZGERALD:

-- because the

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

He has reason to

think there's somebody in the house.

17
18

Fine.

introduction of the person is important -­

15
16

Fine.

MR. FITZGERALD:

Right.

So it's

certainly possible that -­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Or no -­

20

MR. FITZGERALD:

-- an exigency could

21

be created, if there's a person who's wandering

22

--

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So that

24

-- yeah, if that's an exigent circumstance, and

25

you happen to see -- now changing the situation

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

-- you happen to see a motorcycle which is a

2

rather unusual shape and happens to look

3

identically like the one that you know was just

4

stolen, you can't go and -- go look at it?

5

have to get a warrant?

6

away in the meantime, but, nonetheless, you -­

7

you're there by yourself, no other policemen.

8

It's in the window, okay, just like the

9

cocaine, or it's in the driveway.

10
11

You

Of course, they drive

Why can't

you?
MR. FITZGERALD:

So just to be clear,

12

in this case, the Supreme Court of Virginia

13

steered away from exigency and said, no, we're

14

not going -­

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know that.

That's

16

why I thought the tarp made a difference.

17

that's why I thought this was a case about a

18

tarp, oddly enough, and not a case about

19

whether you have an exigent circumstance.

20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. FITZGERALD:

And

It -- it is not a

case about exigent circumstance.
JUSTICE BREYER:

But you just told me

I'm wrong.
MR. FITZGERALD:
exigency case.

This is not an

And the Supreme Court of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

Virginia specifically said that.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, I know that.

3

What I'm trying to get at is I suddenly

4

thought:

5

you said the circumstance is the same without a

6

tarp.

I don't understand this case because

That's what confused me.

7

MR. FITZGERALD:

So the -­

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's why I asked

MR. FITZGERALD:

So the officer

he's been with the person who he believes owns

sorry, did you -­

2

MR. FITZGERALD:

There -- there's no

3

obvious exigency here and that would be an

4

issue for remand in this case.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I go back to the

6

exchange that you had with Justice Alito?

7

you gave your hypothetical about the drugs and

8

he said, well, that would be different, it

9

would be -- it's very different in a home, but

10

here you have the motorcycle parked out in the

11

open, on the driveway in this enclosure, where

12

you can see it from the street.

13

When

And I guess this is the question I

14

want to ask you.

If -- if there is that

15

difference, like in a home you better have a

16

warrant.

17

in the curtilage, in the curtilage, and that's

18

established.

But here it's out on the street but

19

MR. FITZGERALD:

Yes.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

it's not disputed here.

22

committed by Jardines to treat the curtilage

23

exactly as we would the home?

24

to be important given the, I think, the -- the

25

things that you and Justice Alito agreed on.

You know, it's not -­
How far are we

That seems to me

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

So how far do we say:

Look, what

2

Jardines said or what we've said in other cases

3

is we have to treat the curtilage exactly as we

4

would the home, even though you can actually

5

see the motorcycle on the curtilage.

6

MR. FITZGERALD:

Yes, Your Honor.

So,

7

in Jardines, the Court said "the curtilage is

8

protected as part of the home itself for Fourth

9

Amendment purposes."

10

And -- and even though the Court in

11

Jardines -- and at the time, the Court was

12

quoting Oliver, the 1984 case that recognized

13

open fields and said the same thing.

14

And the idea that curtilage is

15

protected as part of the home itself is -- is

16

important, and I think -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

create a right to object.

20

that connection to the property -- connection

21

to the curtilage would be treated the same way

22

as connection to the house.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

So to the extent

Did -- coming back to

24

Justice -- to the -- to the question, did we

25

say in Jardines that the curtilage is to be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

treated the same as the house for all Fourth

2

Amendment purposes?

3

Jardines was whether -- was whether officers

4

who did not have probable cause were permitted

5

to walk up to the front of the house, at which

6

point they acquired probable cause.

7

I thought the issue in

MR. FITZGERALD:

Well, yes, Your

8

Honor.

So Jardines identified a search and it

9

identified a search of the home based on

10

actions taken exclusively in the curtilage of

11

the home.

12

said, as I read it, that the officers acted

13

beyond the scope of the implied license when

14

they brought a drug dog and they spent a few

15

minutes in the curtilage sniffing around.

16

That's not what there would be an implied

17

license to do, which essentially is just a

18

knock and talk.

And it -- the majority essentially

19

And so it's a search of the curtilage.

20

And the Court stopped there, this Court stopped

21

there, but, of course, it was affirming the

22

Florida Supreme Court, which had thrown out the

23

search for lack of a warrant based on the

24

protection of the curtilage.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, we permit

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20

the police to seize items in plain view in a

2

home.

3

They see an item that they have probable cause

4

to believe is incriminating evidence.

5

seize it.

6

They get a search warrant for the home.

They can

Justice Breyer said exigent

7

circumstances permit the police to seize items.

8

I think the assumption -- or not the assumption

9

-- the premise of all of those cases is that

10

the police are there legitimately.

11

a warrant, you are permitted to be there.

12

If you have

In Jardines, you could -- couldn't

the house because you didn't have a right to be

16

And so isn't there a difference when

17

you are in the street, as these police officers

18

were, they have a right to be on the street,

19

they have a right to look at whatever is

20

visible, and they could see the motorcycle from

there?

So is this a plain view case?

Is this

view, in essence?

2

they weren't sure it was the same motorcycle.

3

They thought the wheel was the same, but I'm

4

not sure why they -- they needed that if they

5

knew the motorcycle was stolen, or did they not

6

know yet that it was stolen?

now.

As -- as I understood it,

MR. FITZGERALD:

I don't remember

The -- the record is

He was looking for the motorcycle

MR. FITZGERALD:

I'm looking at this, which is -­

MR. FITZGERALD:

It's -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- the police are

19

standing there, they see something and have

20

probable cause to believe that it's

21

incriminating evidence.

22

than being inside the home with a warrant?

23

How is that different

And -- and, again, does -- I'm not

24

sure I see the difference, although the tarp is

25

a difference because they are lifting -­

they're searching something else besides the

2

motorcycle.

3

MR. FITZGERALD:

So, Your Honor, this

4

is not a plain view case, because in Horton

5

versus California, the Court said, in order for

6

plain view to apply to allow the seizure of the

7

thing, the officer must have a right of access

8

to the thing itself.

9

So there's no right of access.

10

There's no implied license to go into the

11

curtilage to look for evidence that you have

12

seen.

13

street in this case is just like seeing the

14

motorcycle or seeing drugs through the window

15

of a house.

16

And so seeing the motorcycle from the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you dispute the

17

fact that they had probable cause to believe

18

that the thing that they saw covered by the

19

tarp was the motorcycle they were looking for?

21

MR. FITZGERALD:

We do not dispute

that.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23

MR. FITZGERALD:

Okay.
And so, ultimately,

here this is a fairly straightforward case, I

25

think.

There -- the motorcycle is five feet -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you -- you don't

2

dispute -- in other words, you -- in your view,

3

you agree that the policeman standing on the

sidewalk knows that that item covered by -- or

5

at least has probable cause to it -- covered by

the tarp is the possibly stolen motorcycle?

7

You agree with that?

8
9

MR. FITZGERALD:

He -- he has probable

cause to believe that is the motorcycle that

10

Of course, there could be other things under

So that's his

decision; he didn't have to.

now, there is some disagreement in the record

have the right to use your eyes, but you don't

18

have the right to go beyond what a reasonably

19

And stopping to examine or seize a

He's

He testified he

was not knocking and talking.

2

solely to take the cover off to see if this was

3

the motorcycle that he had probable cause to

4

think that it was.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

He walked up

He had probable cause

6

-- you -- I thought you admitted he had

7

probable cause to believe that the thing

8

covered by the tarp was the motorcycle that he

9

-- had eluded him by driving 140 miles an hour.

10

MR. FITZGERALD:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

MR. FITZGERALD:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
Right?
Yes.
So he has probable

14

cause to search that motorcycle, to find the -­

15

the vehicle identification number, which will

16

tell him the owner of the motorcycle, which

17

will help him arrest the person who committed

18

this crime, right?

19

MR. FITZGERALD:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
So the case comes down

21

to this:

If the motorcycle were parked on the

22

street or maybe further down the driveway, and,

23

therefore, not in the curtilage, they wouldn't

24

need a warrant.

25

because it was parked a few feet further away,

They could search it.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official
30
1

although in a spot that's visible from the

2

street, they could search it in the first

3

instance because of the risk that the

4

motorcycle will be taken away, but in the

5

second instance, moved a few feet further up

6

the driveway, still visible from the street,

7

can't be -- they can't search it because of the

8

additional invasion of privacy that is involved

in walking those few feet up the driveway?

MR. FITZGERALD:

JUSTICE ALITO:

12
13

Yes, Your Honor -­
That's what the case

comes down to?
MR. FITZGERALD:

Yes.

The protections

15

curtilage, again, is protected as part of the

16

home itself.

17

And for good reason.

Officers are prevented from going into

the curtilage of a home to prevent them from

19

being, say, in the backyard where there might

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TREVOR S. COX

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. COX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

6

Officer Rhodes's search of the

7

motorcycle should be upheld for three reasons.

8

First, the search occurred outside the firm,

9

bright-line of the house where the

10

justifications for the automobile exception

11

fully apply.

12

Second, Officer Rhodes had probable

13

cause before he ever stepped foot on the

14

driveway.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In your brief, you

16

seem to say that you're not -- you don't seem

17

to say -- you say you're not taking a position

18

on whether an officer can break into a garage

19

or walk into a garage that's closed but not

20

locked.

21

So you -- you seem to be suggesting

22

that the mobility of the automobile, wherever

23

it is, permits the police to enter.

24

by force or without force.

25

MR. COX:

Is that -­

This -- this Court has never

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

said that the mobility changes depending on

2

where it is.

3

To resolve this case -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is that a yes to

4

my question?

Are you -- are -- because that

5

seemed to be what the Virginia -- what the

6

court below is saying, which is the -- where

7

the item is located is irrelevant.

9

motorcycle parked inside the living room -­

If it's an

10

some people park their bikes inside,

11

actually -- doesn't matter where it is, that

12

that gives the police the right to enter and

13

search.

14

MR. COX:

The Supreme Court of

15

Virginia did not impose that restriction.

16

this Court has never done that either.

17

And

We think that it would make sense if

18

the Court were to draw a line here, although

19

it's not necessary.

20

it would make sense to draw it at the firm -­

21

If it were to draw a line,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, you're

22

saying it's not necessary because the facts

23

don't support it, but does the logic of their

24

holding and your position require that outcome?

25

What -- what -- how do we -- and do we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

basically say, contrary to our rule, that the

2

curtilage is not part of your home?

3

is.

We know it

That's what we've said in case after case.

4

So we -- do we say now the curtilage

5

is not part of the home for purposes of

6

automobiles?

7

line?

8
9
10

And then how do I fit in the

MR. COX:

Sure.

There are a couple

things baked in, and let me try to answer them
in turn.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

MR. COX:

All right.

We don't -- we don't read

13

Jardines and the other court cases like Oliver

14

as saying that the curtilage and the home

15

should be treated the same for all purposes.

16

For determining one's reasonable expectations

17

of privacy, you might treat the curtilage and

18

the home the same.

19

seemed to suggest, but it cited to Oliver, you

20

know, one of the curtilage cases.

21

And that's what Jardines

And then, in Footnote 11 of Oliver,

22

they say, we do not say that the curtilage and

23

the home should be treated the same for all

24

purposes.

25

So while it might be true for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

determining the reasonable expectations of

2

privacy, it's not binding on -- on courts to

3

say what's reasonable and what's not, based on

4

whether it's the curtilage or the home.

5

Now, the Supreme Court of Virginia, as

6

I said, did not place a restriction on the

7

automobile exception applying in one -- one

8

place versus another because this Court

9

hasn't -- hasn't done that.

10

If the Court were to draw the line -­

11

and -- and I recognize that you're trying to

12

decide a lot of cases here, not just this one

13

-- that would be a good place to do it because

14

that is the firm bright-line that the Court has

15

recognized in a lot of other cases as well.

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So under that rule,

17

though, police could, as I understand your

18

position, search for cars in garages, closed

19

garages, carports, anywhere on a property, no

20

matter how closely attached, or even if firmly

21

attached to the house?

22

MR. COX:

No, not everywhere on -- on

23

the premises, Your Honor.

24

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

25

A -- the garage -­
Not in the house but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. COX:

Not in a house, but a garage

is often considered part of the house.

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

But if we say

4

that's curtilage, which a lot of cases in the

5

past, at least, have suggested, and we deem a

6

barn, a garage, curtilage, then the police can

7

without a warrant search for a car there under

8

your rule, right?

9

MR. COX:

If it's not part of the

10

dwelling.

11

no, they could not search it.

12

If it is part of the dwelling, then,

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Not many people live

13

in their garage.

14

do, and in barns, but usually they're reserved

15

for cars and for animals.

16
17

Some people do, some people

places the police can search without a warrant.

And there, if, soon

as the smoker, whom he sees in the window or he

believes he's off on the side, as soon as he

16

gets an inclination there's a policeman around,

17

I'll tell you where all that drug is going to

18

be, right down the sink, okay?

19

In that case, he doesn't need a

20

warrant, because there's exigent circumstance.

21

Is that right?

All right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And what we don't

have in this case is we do not have the exigent

ruled that out.

By definition, you all have

about.

Well, you might have
That's not

That's not what this is

Right?
MR. COX:

There is a categorical

12

exigency to automobiles.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But now -- wait,

14

there are two differences between my example.

15

One, it's curtilage, not house.

16

is a movable thing, like a police -- like a -­

17

like a car, okay.

18

And, two, it

So the question is it's -- and,

19

moreover, the policeman didn't know with any

20

certainty -- he certainly suspected, maybe had

21

probable cause -- but he didn't know that's the

22

right motorcycle.

23

Now, if all those things are true

24

hypothetically, it's as if, though it's the

25

curtilage, he saw in the middle of the driveway

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
41

a box, and he thought inside that box there

2

might be a motorcycle or drugs or something.

3

And can he go up without a warrant and

4

without there being exigent circumstances to

5

open the box to look to see if inside there are

6

drugs or a motorcycle?

7

case.

8
9
10

I thought that was this

And even though -- and I think you
want to say, yes, he can, if it's a motorcycle,
but not if it's a box.

11

MR. COX:

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I -- I think that's -­
If it's a big box and

carries a motorcycle -­

14

MR. COX:

Right.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- like a tarp, you

16

can say yes -- you want to say yes, okay, and I

17

would just wonder why?

18
19

MR. COX:

Why?

Well, the court -- the court

has -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, it's on the

21

driveway.

22

that the motorcycle is movable, but there is no

23

exigent circumstance.

24
25

It's in part of his house.

I know

He is search -- wants to look -- look
into the box, open the tarp.

Why?

Does the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

Fourth Amendment permit that?

2

long, long question.

3

and now I've got to my point, and now I'd like

4

to hear your answer.

5

MR. COX:

Okay.

That's a

I just needed the basics,

I'll -- I'll try to answer,

6

and I'm sure you'll correct me if I misstate

7

what the hypothetical says.

8

My understanding is that there was a

9

virtual certainty here that this was the same

10

motorcycle under the tarp.

11

any uncertainty about what was under the box,

12

as it were.

13

So there was not

The Court, to the second part, the

14

Court has also treated other closed containers

15

differently than vehicles.

16

in Acevedo, they have said containers are

17

different than automobiles because of the -­

18

the movability of them is just far greater than

19

the movability of other items.

In the Ross case,

20

And there was a debate, there were

21

some predecessors of yours on the Court who

22

wanted to suggest that closed containers should

23

be treated the same.

justices in Coolidge who thought that was the

case.

Acevedo.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Cox, can -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your

5

point was that -- that you understood on the

6

automobile exception for it to have -- include

7

a categorical exigency aspect.

8
9

In other words, while it's not the
case that you see the guy, you know, revving up

10

the motorcycle about to take off, which would

11

be an exigent circumstance, but you think

12

because -- you want to extend or apply the

13

automobile exception to stationary vehicles on

14

-- on -- within the curtilage because you think

15

all the guy has to do is he sees the police

16

officer, he runs out of the house, starts it up

17

and goes away.

18

MR. COX:

Yes, Your -- Your Honor.

I

19

think that's one of the least controversial

20

points in this case is that because this Court

21

has repeatedly held that a car doesn't actually

22

have to be moving or with somebody there with a

23

key, ready to jump on it.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, then that -­

that goes back to my basic question, which is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

how do I differentiate the -- the car in the

2

garage if -- if -- if -- or the car through a

3

window that you can see?

4

You would say that exigent

5

circumstance -- that's what Virginia Court

6

appeared to say, that it created an absolute

7

rule.

8

anywhere where they see the car, whether

9

they're at that place legitimately or not.

10

The police can break into anything, go

MR. COX:

Yes.

This -- this Court has

11

treated it as an absolute rule.

12

carved -- carved back on that.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

rule you want us to uphold?

15

MR. COX:

They've never

And that's the

It -- it could.

I mean, you

16

could just apply -- apply that rule to this

17

case -­

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

19

MR. COX:

20

if you wanted to.

21

Well, and -­

-- and not make any new law,

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- and then we

22

should just go ahead and do the same thing for

23

drugs and papers too, because -- and Entek, we

24

can overrule Entek while we're at it, going all

25

the way back to the founding because, you know,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

we can see somebody, they have a fireplace,

2

they have a chimney, they could destroy the

3

papers that we see through the window or the

4

drugs.

We know that they have indoor plumbing.

5

And so they can be readily destroyed

6

too.

What's the difference between the

7

destruction of drugs and papers in a home and a

8

car in -- in the garage?

9

MR. COX:

So this gets to Justice

10

Sotomayor's question as well.

11

little bit less mobility inside the garage.

12

There's also more expectation of privacy in a

13

garage.

14

There is a

Those are the two -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's a second.

15

The difference between opening a garage door

16

and just walking out and getting into a car is

17

de minimis.

18

MR. COX:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

Right.

Well -­
You can -- you

can -- you know, it happens just as quickly.
MR. COX:

Right.

And what I just said

22

isn't totally satisfactory because, in McNeely,

23

you said you don't really look at the policy

24

justifications behind a categorical exigency.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if it -- if it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

-- if the distinction -- and there is no real

2

distinction -- why, as Justice Gorsuch

3

suggested, you're asking us to expand the

4

automobile exception dramatically and to

5

basically make an all-time exception forever?

6

Even if the driver -- even if the

7

police know that the driver of this car is away

8

on vacation and won't be returning for two

9

weeks, even if they know that, they're not

10

required to go to a magistrate and get a

11

warrant?

12

MR. COX:

Your Honor, that's been this

13

Court's law for decades.

14

as -- as expanding it as -­

15

And I wouldn't see it

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, counsel, when

16

I -- when I look at the automobile exception's

17

history and go back to Carroll, it was actually

18

an originalist opinion that looked at cars and

19

-- and analogized them to ships and vessels,

20

going all the way back to 1790.

21

different than homes or curtilage.

22

-- and cars are like vessels on the open sea or

23

in port.

24
25

And so that's
And -- and

It never suggested that you can go
look for one in a home.

That was never the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47

basis.

It was:

2

is on the open seas or in a -- in a harbor or

3

on the streets, not that you can go into a home

4

to find one.

5

a category mistake that you're making in your

6

argument.

7

You can search something that

That seems to me categorically -­

Can you help me with that?
MR. COX:

Right.

Well, I wouldn't -­

8

I wouldn't say it's a mistake in my argument.

9

It would be a mistake maybe in the Supreme

10

Court's jurisprudence not to have limited it to

11

that extent previously, but -­

12
13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, I just cited

the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in Carroll.

14

MR. COX:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So I'm not sure it's

16

fair to point it, the arrow, in this direction,

17

counsel.

18

MR. COX:

Well, Carroll did involve a

19

-- a car that was on the street, but there have

20

been many cases since then in the 90 years

21

since Carroll where it's been applied when the

22

car is totally immobile and not on the open

23

road.

24

-- the vehicle exception ever -­

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so it has been a trajectory of the

Mr. Cox.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

MR. COX:

-- ever since then.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes?

I mean, one of the

3

things you're saying is that we basically

4

should give -- we shouldn't pay attention to

5

the fact that this was on the curtilage, and

6

you said earlier -- to a different question,

7

you said, well, you're committed by Jardines to

8

treat the curtilage as the home for purposes of

9

expectation of privacy, but for other purposes,

10
11

you can make a distinction between the two.
And I'd like to know more about that.

12

For what other purposes can you make a

13

distinction between the two?

14

make a distinction between the two for those

15

purposes when you can't make a distinction

16

between the two for this fundamental question

17

of where you have an expectation of privacy?

18

MR. COX:

Sure.

And why can you

Well, certainly,

19

Oliver opened the door to that -- that

20

argument, that we're -- the Court said we're

21

not saying it's the same for all purposes.

22

And one example that we cited in our

23

brief was the difference between Santana and

24

Payton, where you can have a warrantless arrest

25

outside the house, right, even if it's on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

front steps, but you can't have one inside

2

because there's -- it's just beyond the pale.

3

It's beyond the threshold, beyond the firm,

4

bright-line that this Court has -- has drawn.

5

Another example -­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.

You're -­

7

I just want to get the answer to my question,

8

which is:

9

the curtilage differently from the home and why

For what purposes would you treat

10

there but not for the -- for the reasonable

11

expectation of privacy question?

12

purposes first, and then why?

13

MR. COX:

So, for what

So, you know, you cannot

14

search inside the house without a warrant

15

unless there are exigent circumstances or if

16

there's consent.

And that's a line that this

17

Court has drawn.

And the automobile exception

18

is also a -- a categorical rule.

19

find them in -- in -- in friction.

20

Court has to decide what's reasonable -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so we
And so the

It -- it's just -- Mr.

22

Cox, it's really a simple question.

23

purposes would you say that the curtilage is

24

not the house?

25

MR. COX:

For what

For purposes of when you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

have probable cause to search and a warrant -­

2

a warrant exception applies, then you don't

3

treat them the same.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and why is that

5

-- why would you treat -- why would you not

6

treat them the same for purposes of when you

7

need a warrant if you do treat them the same

8

for deciding whether there's a reasonable

9

expectation of privacy in them?

10

MR. COX:

Well, the -- the Court said

11

in Ross that when the automobile exception

12

applies, you are -- you're committed to the

13

same search with the same scope as you would be

14

if you had a warrant.

15

different is having a warrant.

16

So the only thing that's

And so, as long as the investigating

17

officer sticks to that, as the officer did

18

here, you're not going outside the scope of a

19

warrant.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You see, I don't know.

21

Just -- when I read Jardines, here's what I

22

take it to say:

23

the most sacrosanct of places.

24

we don't think that the home stops at the door;

25

we think that there are some areas like the

I take it to say the home is
And, actually,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

porch and like the driveway or whatever, and we

2

can argue about exactly what those areas are,

3

but there are some areas which are just as

4

sacrosanct as your living room.

5

take Jardines to say.

6
7
8
9

That's what I

And in that case, I think you lose
here.
MR. COX:

If -- if that's the case, we

have a much -- much harder case to make, but I

10

don't think -- I don't read Jardines as

11

overruling Santana.

12

creating a knock-and-announce rule at the

13

curtilage.

14

I don't read Jardines as

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can -- can you

15

remind me what you said about the enclosed

16

garage with the door?

17

like the home?

Would that be treated

18

MR. COX:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now, that there is

20

a real problem because you're making a

21

distinction between people who can buy houses

22

with garages and people who are less well

23

heeled and only have a port or a patio for the

24

car instead of a garage.

25

seems to me really troublesome, between garage

So that distinction

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52

2

and carport.
MR. COX:

I guess what I would say is

3

that the Fourth Amendment protects the same

4

quality of privacy but maybe not the same

5

quantity of privacy for everyone.

6

the Dunn factors realizes that -- the Dunn

7

factors incorporate that.

8

money to -- to build a -- a huge wall, then

9

that's going to -- that's going to impact the

10

-- the analysis of whether that area is -- is

11

protected or not.

If you have enough

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

I mean, even

I mean, they're -­
I don't know

why you're -­

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- garages.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not sure

17

why you are arguing -- if I understand your

18

answers to -- to Justice Kagan, you seem to

19

say, okay, let's say the -- the probable cause

20

is based on the -- the fact that you know that

21

the drugs are in -- you know, foot-by-foot

22

orange boxes and you see from -- in the

23

carport, you know, foot-by-foot orange boxes.

24
25

And you -- you seem to be treating
that the same as the situation when you have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

the motorcycle or an automobile, but I thought

2

part of your argument was that the automobiles

3

were inherently different because somebody

4

could just jump on the motorcycle and ride

5

away, while they wouldn't have the same

6

mobility issues with respect to the box, the

7

orange boxes.

8
9

Now, are you arguing -- do you -- does
your argument extend to immobile items in the

10

carport because it's curtilage rather than the

11

house, or is it limited to the mobility that's

12

characterized the automobile exception?

13

MR. COX:

Yes.

The automobile

14

exception is just that.

15

very circumscribed terms -­

16

It's an exception on

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And then the

17

problem with that, of course, is, we've said,

18

the curtilage is like the house and -- maybe

19

you would.

20

in the house, which is not, you know, Jay

21

Leno's house, right, where he's got dozens of

22

rare cars or -- or the Porsche in Ferris

23

Bueller.

24

-- you don't -­

25

I mean, if you have an automobile

I mean, you -- you're saying that you

(Laughter.)

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- you don't

2

-- you can just go in because it's mobile and

3

they got it in there somehow; they can get it

4

out?

5

between the curtilage and the house for the

6

purposes of the vehicles that are mobile?

7

So you don't recognize a distinction

MR. COX:

The Court has laid down a

8

categorical exception.

If you were to draw a

9

line, we think the most sensible place to do it

10

would be the bright-line of the house because

11

it is used in other Fourth Amendment

12

jurisprudence.

13

It doesn't need to reach that here.

14

There are arguments that the mobility stays the

15

same and the other justifications for the

16

automobile exception stay the same, whether

17

it's inside the house or outside the house, but

18

if you need to draw a line, that is a sensible

19

place to do it, not at the curtilage.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22

I'm sorry.

I -- I

-JUSTICE ALITO:

But, Mr. Cox, you know

23

the -- the Fourth Amendment says the people

24

have the right to be secure in their homes,

25

papers, persons, and effects.

So in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

curtilage -- the curtilage issue goes to the

2

question of whether it is a search of the home.

3

If it's not in the curtilage -- curtilage, then

4

it's not a search of the home, the Fourth

5

Amendment doesn't apply.

6

But once you get beyond that, it is a

7

search of the home, the ultimate Fourth

8

Amendment question is always:

9

reasonable search?

Is it a

10

here.

11

interests.

12

-- at the end of the 18th century; it's what it

13

means today.

14

Is it reasonable?

It's a balancing of

That's what reasonableness meant in

And so you have to grapple with the

15

real privacy interests that are involved in the

16

case versus the other considerations; namely,

17

the mobility of the automobile.

18

understand your argument to be, is why it's

19

reasonable to draw a distinction between an

20

enclosed place like the house or garage and an

21

open place like a driveway, even if it

22

technically falls within the curtilage.

MR. COX:

what the automobile exception permits.

would permit the search of the garage or the

it had said:

MR. COX:

need a warrant, and that's the automobile

exception.

15

Are there -- is there any other

16

exception like that where the test of whether

17

you need -- if you have probable cause, forget

18

it, forget the warrant, that probable cause

19

alone is enough?

20

MR. COX:

Well, I think under a plain

21

view you'd have to have some -- some probable

22

cause to believe that what you were say -­

23

seeing was contraband or otherwise evidence of

24

crime.

25

analysis that has to go into knowing that it's

So I think there -- there is some

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the -- the

3

fact that this motorcycle was in plain view,

4

subject to the tarp being on it, was a factor

5

in the decision by the Supreme Court of the

6

State of Virginia, was it not?

7

MR. COX:

I -- I think -­

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I thought they

9

-- I thought they relied upon the fact that it

10

was in plain view with -- with the tarp on it.

11

MR. COX:

I think that that is

12

mentioned, but I think the probable cause that

13

he -- that existed was formed, at least in

14

part, by the comparison of the photograph on

15

the Facebook page and when Officer Rhodes

16

walked up -­

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. COX:

19

-- stood at the end of the

driveway and could see the same thing.

20
21

But -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it was in plain

view?

22

MR. COX:

It was.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's not as if there

24

was a closed garage and they went and opened

25

the garage?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. COX:

That's right.

And he

2

wouldn't -- he wouldn't be able to go up to the

3

edge of the garage, assuming there was

4

curtilage out there, and look in to see if it

5

was in there.

6

before he ever stepped foot on the driveway.

The probable cause was formed

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Cox, was there one

search here or were there two searches here?
MR. COX:

We submit that there was -­

there was one search.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

The search of the

motorcycle?

13

MR. COX:

That's right.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why is that?

Why

15

isn't there the search of the motorcycle -- but

16

there's really the search of the curtilage; it

17

happened to be for the motorcycle, but it's the

18

search of the curtilage, it's a different

19

search entirely.

20

MR. COX:

We -- we look at it as one

21

search because it's the object of the search

22

that you are entitled to search, whether it's

23

under a warrant or under a warrant exception.

24

And you look at it by -- you know, it's not a

25

separate search for each access point that you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61

2

-- you go to.
You wouldn't have gotten two warrants

3

if you had gone to a magistrate.

4

get a warrant to search the motorcycle and then

5

another warrant to actually cross the driveway

6

to get there.

7
8
9

You wouldn't

So we see it as -- as one search for
that reason.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, does -- does

10

that mean you, without a warrant, that you

11

always have access to a place if there's a

12

reason that you can seize something that you

13

might find within the place?

14

MR. COX:

I'm hesitant to speak beyond

15

the automobile exception, but I think the

16

automobile exception would give you that, that

17

ability, unless there was some other rule that

18

prevented you from doing it, such as a rule

19

that the automobile exception doesn't apply in

20

the house.

21

And I'll say that, to go back to

22

Justice Gorsuch's questions about the original

23

understanding of this, all along the

24

justifications for the vehicle exception have

25

been based in the contradistinction between

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

vehicles and houses or dwellings.

2

At first it was the difference in

3

mobility, but then later in -- in cases like

4

Cady and Cardwell and Carney, they also speak

5

of the reduced expectations of privacy that you

6

have in a vehicle as compared to a fixed

7

dwelling or a building.

8
9

So, if the Court were to draw a line,
it would -- it would certainly have some -­

10

some healthy pedigree in the Court's previous

11

decisions.

12
13

Unless there are further questions,
thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW A. FITZGERALD

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20
21
22

MR. FITZGERALD:

Thank you.

Just a

few points in rebuttal here.
So the curtilage is protected as part

23

of the home.

And if we look back, historically

24

speaking, the automobile exception is born at a

25

traffic stop in the 1920s.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

The automobile exception, as it is

2

created, makes sense in that context.

3

automobile exception has grown.

4

categorical exception.

5

exigency on a case-by-case basis.

6

automobile exception is literally knocking at

7

the door of the house.

8
9

But the

It's become a

We no longer look for
And now the

And the question is whether to apply
this exception, created based on exigent

10

circumstances in 1925, to a search of the

11

curtilage of a home.

12

And now, on the state's argument,

13

even -- even their backup argument, even what

14

they give up, there easily could have been

15

probable cause to think that this motorcycle

16

was at this residence if it were around behind

17

the house, if the driveway went just a little

18

bit farther.

19

And it should not be that searching

20

for an automobile, or what might be in an

21

automobile, would get police around a house

22

like that, around to the back door, where there

23

might be, I mean, in this case, the side door,

24

a sliding door, where if you're standing where

25

this motorcycle is, you can see directly into

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

the side door of the house and you can see this

2

just a little bit at the petition appendix page

3

112.

4

The curtilage is an area that is

5

intimately linked to the home.

6

in Jardines, as well as in Ciraolo, it's

7

intimately linked to the home, both physically

8

and psychologically, and it's where

9

expectations of privacy are most heightened.

10

This Court said

We submit that the clear, bright-line

11

rule for officers, which is that when they go

12

to a known address to look for contraband, even

13

readily-mobile contraband, they bring a warrant

14

with them, should apply when they're going to a

15

known address to look for a vehicle as well.

16

And if there are no further questions,

17

respectfully I ask this Court to reverse.
