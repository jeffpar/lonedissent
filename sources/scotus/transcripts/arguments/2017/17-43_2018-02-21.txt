United States.

Mr. Shanmugam.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The federal wiretap statute, Title

12

III, was enacted 50 years ago in response to

13

national concern over wiretapping and the

14

threat it posed to individual privacy.

15

Title III prohibits wiretapping unless

16

a series of detailed requirements is met.

17

to ensure compliance with those requirements,

18

Title III directs the suppression of the

19

evidence derived from a wiretap order when

20

there is an error in obtaining, issuing, or

21

executing that order.

22

And

As is relevant here, Title III directs

23

suppression if a judge issues an order that is

24

insufficient on its face; that is, if the order

25

itself fails to comply with any of Title III's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

requirements.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shanmugam, the

3

expression "insufficient to authorize," this

4

order was sufficient to authorize all of the

5

interceptions that were introduced in evidence.

6

The problem was that it authorized more, but

7

that more was never introduced.

8

understand how you can characterize the -- the

9

order here as in -- insufficient.

So I don't

It was

10

sufficient, but then it went beyond, and that

11

beyond was not operative in this case.

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Ginsburg, let

13

me go directly to that threshold argument which

14

the government makes for the first time before

15

this Court.

16

government -­

17

To the best of our knowledge, the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- you said

18

that.

19

the magistrate judge and the district judge

20

went on.

21

But it seems to me that was exactly what

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The magistrate judge

22

and the district court seemed to conclude that,

23

by virtue of the fact that all of the

24

interceptions that were introduced were

25

interceptions that took place within the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

court's territorial jurisdiction, that there

2

was no problem, and that, therefore,

3

suppression was not required.

4

that they really grappled with this argument

5

that the government now makes about the meaning

6

of the term "insufficient."

7

I don't think

But let me address the merits of that

8

argument directly, Justice Ginsburg.

The

9

government seems to make the argument now that

10

these orders were not insufficient on their

11

face because they were merely overbroad.

12

don't think that that's the better reading of

13

the phrase "insufficient on its face," either

14

as a matter of plain text or as a matter of the

15

policies that were animating the inclusion of

16

this particular provision.

17

But I

Let me state first what we think

18

"insufficient" means.

We think that an order

19

is insufficient on its face if the failure to

20

comply with the requirements of Title III is

21

evident from the four corners of the order

22

itself.

23

under such a standard, the orders here would be

24

invalid because each of the orders here

25

contained jurisdictional provisions that went

And the government now concedes that,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

too far, that went beyond the power of the

2

district court to authorize.

3
4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But those -­

those weren't -­

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it was fully

6

sufficient for what, in fact, happened, other

7

than Missouri, and we'll have leave that out.

8
9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But, Justice Kennedy,

if the statute merely prohibited the

10

introduction of evidence from unlawful

11

interceptions, I might be inclined to agree

12

with you.

13

suppression provision here does more.

14

But, of course, we know that the

It not merely prohibits and requires

15

suppression where there is an unlawful

16

interception; it goes further and refers to

17

some category of cases where the order is

18

insufficient on its face.

19

Now the government attempts to make

20

this plain language distinction between orders

21

that are overbroad and orders that are somehow

22

otherwise insufficient.

23

look at the very dictionary definitions that

24

the government now relies on for the word

25

"insufficient," you'll see that those

But I think if you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

definitions essentially define the terms

2

"insufficient" and "inadequate" and "invalid"

3

effectively synonymously.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I

5

understand "inadequate" being the same as

6

"insufficient," but I don't understand

7

"invalid."

8

you know, you must have these four things in

9

your -- in your order, and you have -- and you

I mean, if you have a requirement,

10

fill them out and you've got all four, and then

11

you've got another one that's not required, it

12

seems to me that that might be invalid, but -­

13

but you can't say it's insufficient.

14

got everything you have to -- have to have.

15

You've

And yet, you're saying if you add

16

something else, it's insufficient.

17

me it might be invalid under the statute as you

18

say, you can't do what the fifth thing says,

19

but I don't see why -- why it would be

20

insufficient.

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It seems to

Well, Mr. Chief

22

Justice, I suppose that one could try to draw

23

fine distinctions between all of these terms.

24

I think each of the three dictionaries on which

25

the government relies defines the term

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

"invalid" to mean "inadequate," and they define

2

"inadequate" to mean "insufficient."

3

But I think even if you think -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but you

5

need them to define "insufficient" to mean

6

"invalid."

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But I'm happy to -- to

8

-- to fight this case on the ground that we're

9

talking about insufficiency or, as you put it,

10

inadequacy.

11

We believe that these orders -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what

12

about invalidity?

13

You have to say that "insufficient" -- you have

14

to say that "invalid" is the same as

15

"insufficient."

16

Forget I said inadequacy.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I don't think that

17

that's necessarily true, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

think you could say that these orders were

19

insufficient precisely because they lacked a

20

valid limitation.

21
22

In other words, the -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could the orders

have been used for anything?

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

I

No.

If an order is -­

Well, then it's

invalid.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, correct.

I

2

mean, in other words, I -- I'm -- we certainly

3

take the view that those terms are, in fact,

4

synonymous here; and, indeed, that's the view

5

that the government took below when it referred

6

to the potential facial invalidity of these

7

orders.

8

But I think my point -­

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You didn't -­

10

the -- the order didn't need any statement with

11

regard to the territorial limitation, did it?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

We believe that -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If that were

14

not in this order, the order would still be

15

sufficient, correct?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

We believe that the

17

orders would still be insufficient if they did

18

not contain that; in other words, we believe

19

that the better reading of this statute is that

20

it requires the jurisdictional limitation to

21

appear on the face of the order.

22

course, here, the orders -­

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But, of

Any -- do you

have any authority for that?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

I -- I would rely on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

the language of the statute itself.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have

3

any judicial authority interpreting the

4

statute?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So I'm not aware of

6

any case that presents the question of what

7

would happen if a jurisdictional limitation

8

were entirely omitted, and my understanding in

9

Mr. Tripp's -­

10
11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Where do you see it in

the statute as requiring that?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So I would point to

13

2518(3) itself.

14

that 2518(3) is not worded in terms of what an

15

order shall specify, I think in some sense it

16

goes even further.

17

that Congress thought was so foundational that

18

it included it in the very provision that

19

authorizes a judge to enter a wiretap order in

20

the first place.

21

And while it is certainly true

This is the one requirement

8

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

would still be insufficient.
But, Mr. Chief Justice, to get back to

11

your question that started this discussion, I

12

don't think that the Court needs to answer that

13

question whereas, here, you have a provision

14

that goes further.

21
22

25

I don't see anywhere in this

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

I mean, we're

talking about -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Who are you telephone

number 1 or number 2, one of those two?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know that, but I

3

mean for purposes of this order.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Okay.

Now where does

6

it say in this order in respect to telephone

7

number 1 or telephone number 2 that they can

8

intercept within the jurisdiction of the

9

issuing magistrate?

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So the orders -- and

11

let me take you to page 97 of the Joint

12

Appendix.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. SHANMUGAM:

doesn't say anything about -- it talks about

-- in the relevant full paragraph on page 97.

19

I don't see here anywhere.

20

I mean, if what you said was true, why

21

didn't you challenge this on the ground that

22

it's insufficient because it does not claim or

23

put in words that, in respect to telephone

24

number 1 and telephone number 2, you have

25

authority to intercept within the jurisdiction

does it say they have jurisdiction to intercept

Does it?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

6

Well, I think

that it is at a minimum implicit in that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Implicit that it says

that interception may take place in the

But aside

from those words.

15

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But I think our -- but

16

I think our argument would be the same, Justice

17

Breyer.

18

that this provision goes too far.

19

exceeding his power when he enters an order

20

that authorizes effectively nationwide

21

jurisdiction over the tapping -­

In other words, our argument here is

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

24
25

The judge is

All right.
-- of these phones and

the other phones.
JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason -- see, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

-- I can't ask my question because you've

2

stopped me cold; that is, what I thought was

3

that we'd have an order which says you can tap

4

in Kansas and you can also tap outside of

5

Kansas.

6

And I find the paragraph which says

7

you can tap outside of Kansas.

8

can't find the paragraph which says you can tap

9

in Kansas.

10

Okay?

But I

So the first thing you say is, well,

11

it's insufficient if an order does not say you

12

can tap in Kansas -- yeah, that's what you

13

cite, you just said that -- and so I never

14

thought of that.

15

And -- but, lo and behold, I never

16

thought of it, although I read the briefs in

17

this case, and I read the opinion below, and

18

they never said anything about it.

19

So I started where the -- where -­

20

where -- I think, I can't remember who asked

21

the question, I started saying it doesn't have

22

to say that because that's not listed in Title

23

IV.

That's in Title III.

24

MR. SHANMUGAM:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right?
Yeah.

So -­

So you see my

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

puzzlement?

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I -- I do see your

3

point, Justice Breyer.

4

you know, again, we think that all of this

5

should work.

6

you know, a simple one that I think courts have

7

consistently accepted, at least up until now

8

when the government is suddenly making this

9

argument.

10

So let me explain how,

And I think that our position is,

That is, first of all, that

11

"insufficient" here really does comport -- does

12

imply a failure to comply with any of Title

13

III's requirements.

14

concedes that this provision does not comply

15

with those requirements because it goes further

16

than even the language in the statute

17

authorizing these telephone interceptions.

18

And here the government

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Well,

19

suppose I said this.

20

here saying, which I just read you, which says

21

you can tap outside of Kansas.

22

had nothing to do with that.

23

outside or whatever.

24
25

There is one paragraph

Your clients
They were never

Okay?

So what we do is we excise that
paragraph.

It's called severability.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Excise

Official
17
1

it and send the case back to see, with that

2

paragraph excised, whether there's some other

3

reason why this warrant could not be granted.

4

What about that?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I mean, you can

6

do that, Justice Breyer.

7

think that the failure expressly to authorize

8

interception within the jurisdiction would, at

9

most, be an additional reason why this is

10

In other words, I

defective.

11

Again, our view, as I indicated in

12

response to Justice Kagan, is that when you

13

take a look at Section 2518(3), it indicates

14

that this is an additional requirement.

15

Indeed, as I said earlier, really sort of the

16

foundational requirement.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is your -- is your

18

view dependent on our accepting that, that it's

19

not only a foundational requirement but that

20

it's a foundational requirement that has to be

21

on the face of the order?

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

No, because of the

23

overbreadth of the orders.

In other words, as

24

I indicated to Justice Breyer, I certainly

25

think that, to the extent that the failure

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

specifically to refer to Kansas matters, it

2

would only help our argument.

3

But at bottom, our argument is that

4

because the order exceeds the Court's

5

territorial jurisdiction, it's facially

6

inadequate and, therefore, insufficient.

7

Now the government -­

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

I -- I tried to -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, irrespective -­

10

irrespective of whether the jurisdiction has to

11

be stated on the face of the order?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes, that is correct.

13

In other words, our view is that because there

14

is a conceded failure to comply with one of

15

Title III's requirements, that's all that's

16

needed.

17

And I think that the government's

18

argument would really lead to strange and

19

anomalous results here.

20

In our reply brief, we give the

21

example of an order that authorized

22

interception for 180 days rather than 30 days.

23

I think the government would take -- I think

24

the government would take the same position:

25

That that order would not be facially

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

insufficient because it would merely be

2

overbroad, in Justice Ginsburg's words.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, but in that

4

situation, if the -- if there were

5

interceptions beyond the period that's allowed

6

by the statute, then -- then those would be

7

suppressed under, I guess it's subsection (1),

8

right, so it was acquired illegally?

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I'm not sure

10

about that, Justice Alito.

11

Subsection 1 were to apply in that context,

12

there would still be the additional inquiry

13

about the core concerns of the statute that

14

this Court mandated in Chavez and Giordano.

15
16
17

In other words, if

But I think that that example really
points out -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought the

18

circuit split that we had granted on was

19

whether the core concern analysis applied to

20

subdivisions (ii) and (iii), three.

21

the circuit split that we granted?

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is the question

23

on which this Court granted cert.

24

I don't mean to -­

25

Isn't that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And, again,

Well, it wasn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

the question presented, but that seemed to be

2

the focus of the entire briefing in this case,

3

with the exception of the government's new

4

argument that this wasn't insufficient, but -­

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

And the -­
-- putting that

aside, I thought that we granted cert on that.

8
9

Yes.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is the question

on which the circuits are divided.

And I don't

10

mean to fight too hard the Court's addressing

11

this threshold argument that the government is

12

now making.

13

in passing, in its brief in opposition.

14

The government did make it, albeit

I think that the Court really did

15

grant cert on the premise that these orders

16

were insufficient, but I think that it's no

17

surprise that, before this Court, on the actual

18

question on which this Court granted review,

19

the government has comparatively little to say.

20
21
22

JUSTICE ALITO:

But, you know, if we

-JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why -- why

23

should we, if -- if we think that the phrase

24

"insufficient" doesn't mean overbreadth, why

25

should we proceed to base a decision on a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

premise that we think is wrong?

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, first -­

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -- and -- and

4

your point about -- why was the district court

5

wrong when it said simply, "the government did

6

not actually intercept communications outside

7

this court's jurisdiction;" therefore, as

8

applied, the orders did not violate the

9

statute.

10

That seems to make good sense.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think that that is a

11

regime that Congress could have enacted.

But I

12

don't think, Justice Ginsburg, that that is the

13

regime that Congress did enact.

14

In other words, Congress did not enact

15

a regime in which the sole focus was whether or

16

not a particular application was unlawful.

17

that had been what Congress had intended, it

18

would have stopped after subparagraph (1).

19

instead -­

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

If

But

I mean, I tried to

21

figure out where this "insufficient on its

22

face" language came from, because it is

23

somewhat curious.

24

probably researched this more thoroughly, but

25

the best I could come up with was that it was

And I'm sure that you have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

taken from old Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules

2

of Criminal Procedure.

3
4

So, if that's the case, should we look
to the way that rule was applied?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So I don't think that

6

we know that that is where the phrase came

7

from.

8

United States Code, to which -- as far as I'm

9

aware.

10

It does not appear anywhere else in the

But I think, quite frankly, I would

11

not go -- I would not think that the Court

12

would need to go any further than looking to,

13

again, the plain meaning of the term

14

"insufficient" but also the policies animating

15

the inclusion of this provision.

16

And I do think it would lead to highly

17

anomalous results to limit insufficiency and to

18

exclude cases in which language is overbroad

19

but yet concededly violative of the statute.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, if you -- if

21

-- do you think that if this situation had been

22

presented to the Congress that enacted the -­

23

the 1968 legislation, which was basically

24

anti-crime legislation, that they would have

25

said, yes, in this case, Mr. Dahda can't be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

convicted even though what happened here had no

2

effect whatsoever on him?

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I do think so, and I

4

think so precisely because of what Congress, or

5

the Senate, to be more precise, said in the

6

Senate report, where -- where the Senate made

7

quite clear -- and this is at page 96 of the

8

report -- that it intended to compel

9

compliance, strict compliance, with the

10
11

requirements of the statute.
And, again, as I indicated at the

12

outset, Title III was enacted against the

13

backdrop of a vigorous national debate over

14

whether wiretapping should even be permitted in

15

the first place.

16

And I think, as part of the compromise

17

that was struck when Congress enacted Title

18

III, it included a very muscular suppression

19

provision.

20

Now I think what the government tries

21

to do throughout its brief, and I suspect

22

you'll hear this from my friend Mr. Tripp

23

today, is to try to get this Court to think

24

about this case in traditional Fourth Amendment

25

terms where the Court is always taking into

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

account broader principles of prejudice and

2

causation and the like.

3

And I think that where this is

4

clearest is in the government's argument that

5

the Court should somehow sever the invalid

6

applications of the orders from valid ones.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there was no

8

invalid application.

The only intercepts that

9

were introduced were in -- from the District of

10

Kansas.

11

invalid application, but there was no such

12

invalid application.

13

So the -- the order authorized an

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, in fact, there

14

were.

15

intercepted from a wire room in St. Louis.

16

response to the motion to suppress, the

17

government, I think quite wisely, indicated

18

that it was not going to introduce those

19

communications.

20

There were communications that were
In

But I think, more broadly, I would say

21

two things about that, Justice Ginsburg.

22

First, I would say that when you have a

23

facially insufficient order, any communications

24

that are intercepted pursuant to that order are

25

unlawfully intercepted.

I think that that was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

the premise of this Court's decisions in Chavez

2

and Giordano.

3

And, second, that to the extent that

4

the government is making this back-end argument

5

about a severance principle and seeking to

6

introduce a severance principle that the lower

7

courts have recognized in the exclusionary rule

8

context into Title III, that there's just

9

simply no textual footing for that.

10
11

The

statute -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- you -­

12

you did recognize that if that paragraph were

13

deleted, this order wouldn't be sufficient?

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Potentially.

Leaving

15

aside our argument that you would have to

16

affirmatively state a jurisdictional

17

limitation.

18

But I think, more broadly, if you

19

agree with us on the issue of facial

20

insufficiency, the government's fallback

21

argument, leaving aside its relatively cursory

22

argument on the actual question presented, is

23

that you should apply a severance principle.

24

And not only does that principle have no

25

footing in the actual text of Title III's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

suppression provision, I think that that would

2

really sort of effectively all but read

3

subparagraph (2) out of that statute.

4

What the government is attempting to

5

do -- do through these various arguments is to

6

create a regime under which only when there is

7

unlawful interception and the fruits of that

8

unlawful interception are introduced, can there

9

be suppression.

10

Again, if that were true, why did

11

Congress go on to say in subparagraph (2)

12

essentially that even if communications were

13

lawfully intercepted, there should be

14

suppression when an order is insufficient on

15

its face.

16

And, again, the severance principle on

17

which the government relies, and the government

18

cites various lower court decisions for that

19

proposition, is a principle that was not well

20

established in the law in 1968.

21

court of appeals, as far as I'm aware, had even

22

recognized that principle.

23

No federal

And, of course, that principle is

24

animated by concerns about the harsh effects of

25

the judicially created exclusionary rule.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE BREYER:

No -- I mean, but

2

here's the problem that -- look, first, if I

3

look at this, what that -- what you just

4

pointed to says you have to have in this

5

document the nature and location of where the

6

authority to intercept is granted.

7

Yes.

8
9

You just pointed to that.

Doesn't it?

So I look

at the last page and it says District of

10

Kansas.

11

District of Kansas.

12

that that's what they want, exactly what you

13

said, that's where the authority comes from,

14

and Title III makes clear they can't go beyond

15

that authority, except in some circumstances

16

that are not present here.

17

It says it.

The judge puts his title,
There is the authority

So what we have with the paragraph

18

you're pointing to is an addition.

19

In addition, you can go outside of Kansas.

20

That is wrong.

21

outside of Kansas insofar as your client is

22

concerned and anything that was introduced into

23

evidence is concerned.

24
25

It says:

And, by the way, they didn't go

So everybody's instinct, or at least
mine, to say, well, sever that, is -- maybe the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

judge wrote poetry on the wrong paper, you

2

know?

3

a joke.

4

was totally extraneous that had nothing to do

5

with the case.

6

I mean, maybe he -- he -- he wrote down
Maybe he -- he wrote something that

We wouldn't look at that; we'd just

7

say forget it, it has nothing to do with this

8

case.

9

with this paragraph?

10

And why shouldn't we do the same thing

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I understand that

11

instinct, Justice Breyer, because that would be

12

a natural Fourth Amendment instinct.

13

words, lower courts who have looked at the

14

issue have pretty universally now concluded

15

that when you're in the traditional

16

exclusionary rule context and when, say, you

17

have an order that authorizes -- a warrant that

18

authorizes the search of two apartments and

19

there's probable cause as to one and not as to

20

the other, you sever.

21

In other

I think that the only problem with

22

that, and in our view, it's a dispositive

23

problem, is the actual language of the statute.

24

The statute draws a direct line between an

25

invalid, insufficient order and the suppression

order.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

you would -- I don't think in that context, you

know, you would ordinarily talk about

24

insufficiency.

25

recognize, Mr. Chief Justice, that there are

And I'm willing to also

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30

circumstances in which insufficiency

2

necessarily means that something is lacking.

3

I mean, I think that when we think

4

about, say, evidentiary insufficiency, that

5

ordinarily, you know, you can't have too much

evidence; you can only have too little.

7

think that this is a somewhat unusual

8

formulation.

9

as I indicated to Justice Alito, doesn't appear

10

I

And, again, it's a formulation,

anywhere else in the United States Code.

11

And I do think that the definition of

12

the term "insufficient," even if you view

13

"insufficient" to mean "lacking," could easily

14

mean lacking a valid limitation.

15

necessarily mean lacking a provision that the

16

order is required by statute to contain.

17

It doesn't

I see that my yellow light is on, so

18

I'll just say one thing about the actual

19

question presented here and the government's

20

argument.

21

read a core concerns requirement or a

22

fundamental defect requirement into

23

subparagraph (2), it would essentially be

24

creating the very problem that this Court

25

addressed when it adopted that requirement in

I think that if this Court were to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And I think it's really no accident

3

that, for that reason, the government devotes

4

most of its brief to these arguments that it

5

had not previously made and that really don't

go to that question.

And with that, I'll reserve the
balance of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

15

Thank you.

MR. TRIPP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

16

I think, as most of the questioning

17

has already picked up, the -- the best way to

18

encapsulate our basic position in this case is

19

-- is just to imagine what would have happened

20

if everything was exactly the same except this

21

-- this language was missing from the orders,

22

it didn't add this additional authority telling

us that we could put the wire room outside

Justice Breyer is

position that every order does not have to say

it's limited to Kansas?

14

says you can go outside.

15

MR. TRIPP:

It's actually in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it says "may

enter an ex parte order as requested or as

10

modified," et cetera, "within the territorial

11

jurisdiction of the court in which the judge is

sitting."

13
14

You take that "within" to mean that
the judge has to be within that jurisdiction?

15
16
17
18
19

MR. TRIPP:

Well, so -- wait -- wait,

sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Or that the order

has to be within that jurisdiction?
MR. TRIPP:

So we -- we now agree -­

20

there -- there was dispute in the lower courts

21

about whether a tapped mobile phone qualified

22

as a mobile interception device within the next

23

clause of that, saying that we could put our

24

wire room anywhere in the country.

25

agree with Petitioner that the answer is no, we

We now

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

can't; the wire room needs to be in the same

2

judicial district.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I -- I'm

4

sorry.

Do you agree that the order has to be

5

within the -- for interceptions within the

6

jurisdiction?

7

you agree this is not a mobile -­

8
9

Except for a mobile device, and

MR. TRIPP:

Yes, so an -- an order

from the District of Kansas, we need to put our

10

wire room in the District of Kansas.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Are

12

you taking the position that the order does not

13

have to say, at all, that it's within the

14

jurisdiction?

15
16

MR. TRIPP:
our position.

17
18
19
20

Yeah, that is absolutely

position?
MR. TRIPP:

Yeah, absolutely.

I think

that that -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. TRIPP:

All right.

-- follows just straight

23

from the text of the statute.

24

that this is in -­

25

That's your

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It is enough

So you're saying

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

only a violation of those four -- of -- of

2

subparagraph (4), even though the whole process

3

of ordering is premised on it being an order

4

within the jurisdiction of the Court?

5

MR. TRIPP:

Well, I -- I -- so this is

6

obviously an order from the Kansas court.

7

don't think there's any dispute about that.

8

And then the question was just:

9

put our wire room?

10

I think I was trying -­

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I

Where do we

That's such a

12

strange position, though, that you would have

13

an order that wouldn't tell you where you could

14

do this.

15

MR. TRIPP:

I -- I -- I think it -- it

16

just follows.

It's a -- it's a background rule

17

that follows from the statute.

18

When you get an order that says that

19

it's coming from the District of Kansas, then

20

the rule is you can either intercept inside the

21

District of Kansas or outside the District of

22

Kansas if you're using a mobile interception

23

device.

24

III case.

25

That's the rule in every single Title

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What did it do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

with the requirement of every warrant that you

2

have to give a time, place?

3

requires a time, a place.

4

MR. TRIPP:

6

Right.

We know the rule

So -­
But there's no

place here.

7

MR. TRIPP:

No, the -- the -- the -­

8

so if you look at the checklist of items that

9

-- that the statute expressly requires every

10

order to contain, it -- it does all of those

11

things.

It tells you many times -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about if the

13

judge fails to make the required findings under

14

(3)?

15

didn't do what subparagraph (3) requires?

Would the order be insufficient if he

16

MR. TRIPP:

I -- I think actually that

17

is a classic example of something that would

18

fall within prong 1.

19

hard to think of a situation where you would

20

have an order where on its face it's clear from

21

the order that the judge didn't make any of

22

those requisite findings, really for two

23

reasons.

24
25

It -- it -- it -- it's

One is, again, those findings don't
actually need to appear in the order.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Title

Official
37
1

III doesn't require that.

2

And then the other is, you know, in

3

practice, they actually quite often recite a

4

probable cause finding.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Uh-huh.

So that's

6

your position.

7

jurisdiction is missing, it falls under prong

8

1?

MR. TRIPP:

11

Your position is, if the

If jurisdiction is -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

(i), I should say,

not 1, under -­

12

MR. TRIPP:

Sorry, an important point.

13

So, if jurisdiction is missing and we sought to

14

introduce evidence that was intercepted from

15

outside the jurisdiction, right, if we had -­

16

if there had been no language in this case, in

17

-- in these orders -­

18
19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This is a more

interesting argument -­

20

MR. TRIPP:

It is.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- what you're -­

22

because I can't figure out how you could have

23

an order that doesn't have jurisdiction.

24

seems to me that that's a requirement of every

25

warrant.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It

Official
38
1

MR. TRIPP:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

So I -- I think -­
So, if it's not

correctable somewhere, it makes no sense to me.

4

MR. TRIPP:

The -- the -- it does not

5

need to say where the wire room needs to be

6

located.

7

the applications in this case didn't even say

8

where we were going to put the wire room, that

9

that went to how we were going to implement the

10
11

Indeed, I'll -- I'll -- I'll say that

order of the Kansas court.
The jurisdiction that flowed from

12

those orders flow -- flowed from the fact that

13

it was an order of the District of Kansas.

14

said District of Kansas across the top.

15

It

And so the -- the upshot of that is

16

that we either needed to put the wire room

17

inside Kansas or we could put it outside if we

18

were using a mobile interception device, which

19

we -- which we weren't doing here.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Tripp, if -­

21

if -- if you -- if the order doesn't have to

22

include anything about territorial

23

jurisdiction, how is anybody to know whether it

24

approves interception only within the

25

territorial jurisdiction or instead outside

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1
2

that jurisdiction?
I mean, there's a -- there's a -­

3

there's a choice here, depending on whether

4

there's a mobile interception device, right?

5

If there's a mobile interception device, you

6

can approve interception more widely than if

7

there's not a mobile interception device.

8

So I would think looking at this

9

statute -- and I recognize that it's not

10

included in one of the things that's said in

11

Number (4), but that Number (3), you know, just

12

implicitly requires a court to say which one it

13

is, is it just within the jurisdiction or is it

14

outside the jurisdiction, because there's a

15

mobile interception device at issue.

16

MR. TRIPP:

So I -- I -- I think our

17

first response is that the statute doesn't

18

require it to appear in the order because the

19

statute doesn't say that.

20
21
22

And then I think the -- the second is
that the background -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how is -- I

23

guess what I'm saying is -- I appreciate

24

that -- but how is anybody to know unless the

25

court says that?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

MR. TRIPP:

So I think -­

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, they're not

3

going to know what they're -- they can do

4

unless the court says what they can do.

5

MR. TRIPP:

Right.

So I -- so I think

6

it's clear to everybody that in all these cases

7

that we can put the wire room inside Kansas,

8

right, that flows from -- from this just sort

9

of background jurisdictional principle, and the

10

harder question in all of these cases is -- or

11

that -- that prompted this line of cases was:

12

Well, what about the -- what is a mobile

13

interception device?

14

outside?

15

When can you put it

And in this case, we got advance

16

judicial approval from the district court of

17

the government's view at the time, that when

18

you were tapping a cell phone, that qualified

19

as a mobile interception device.

20

the -- the wire room outside Kansas.

21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- you were

wrong about that.

23

MR. TRIPP:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

We could put

We were wrong.
Am I -- am I right

that that's an obsolete thing?

The mobile

Heritage Reporting Corporation

interception device you thought was the mobile

2

phone, but it's really the bug.

MR. TRIPP:

It's really the bug,

that's right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MR. TRIPP:

And now they don't

Not -- not never, but, you

8

know, you -- you -- you might install a bug

9

inside a car or something to track all the

10

communications in the car, not just the

11

communications over a phone.

12
13

It's just a different kind of case and
-- and -- and would -- none of that -­

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

another way, Mr. Tripp.

16

order authorizing or approving the interception

17

shall specify.

18
19
20

But let me say this
On 17a, it says:

Each

And you're right, the jurisdictional
thing does not appear in this list.
But then, if you look at 16a, what is

21

an order authorizing or approving the

22

interception, on 16a in paragraph (3), it says,

23

well, the judge enters an order authorizing or

24

approving interception, either within the

25

territorial jurisdiction or outside that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

jurisdiction, depending on whether there's this

2

mobile interception device.

3

So it just does seem to me that that's

4

just got to be a necessary part of an order

5

authorizing the interception.

6

MR. TRIPP:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

Well, I -­
Where is the

interception supposed to take place?

9

MR. TRIPP:

10

So -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Either within the

11

jurisdiction or outside, depending on whether

12

there's a mobile interception device.

13

just got to be in the order because, otherwise,

14

how would you know -­

15

MR. TRIPP:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

It's

So I -­
-- which of those two

possible things is true?

18

MR. TRIPP:

So I -- and two follow-ups

19

on that.

20

-- it -- it -- it's "and," right, and so we can

21

do it inside the territorial jurisdiction and

22

outside if we're using a mobile interception

23

device.

24
25

It -- it doesn't say either/or.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It

Well, no, but it is an

either/or because if it's -- if there's a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

mobile interception device, it's both.

2

it's not a mobile interception device, it's

3

only one.

4

MR. TRIPP:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6
7

And if

Right, and I think -­
And that's a

disjunctive thing, it's only one or it's both?
MR. TRIPP:

Yes, but -- but that is

8

something that goes to how the government is

9

going to implement the order, how we're going

10

to go about intercepting the communications.

11

It -- it -- it is not a -- a -- a determination

12

that the judge needs to make up front when

13

issuing the order.

14

Actually, I think another thing that

15

drives that home is in (3), (3) goes on and

16

lists a number of things that come after this

17

jurisdictional provision that the judge must

18

determine on the basis of facts submitted by

19

the applicant.

20

those things, because the application doesn't

21

need to say -­

And jurisdiction is not one of

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. TRIPP:

It does say -­

-- whether we're using a

24

mobile interception device.

We -- that -- that

25

-- that's not part of the process.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This was a new -­
Mr. Tripp, how do

3

you -- how do you answer Mr. Shanmugam's

4

positing, suppose this order had authorized the

5

interception to continue for 180 days when the

6

statute says only 30 days?

7

MR. TRIPP:

Yeah.

So I -- we actually

8

offered a pretty similar hypothetical to this

9

in our brief at page 37, because I think it's

10

-- it's a good illustration of the practical

11

difference between our position and

12

Petitioner's.

13

So both sides are in full agreement

14

that from days 31 forward we can't use the

15

evidence.

16

It would need to be suppressed.
The principal difference between our

17

positions is that what we're saying is that

18

from days 1 to 30, when the order has validly

19

authorized us to intercept those

20

communications, in full conformity with Title

21

III, we have that authority.

22

Whereas, what Petitioners are saying

23

is that, as soon as it goes across the line at

24

all, right, if it said 31 days instead of 30,

25

their -- their position is that you need to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

throw all of the evidence out, no matter what,

2

even if the government noticed the problem and

3

never did any interception after day 30.

4
5
6

So it's really a very extreme
position.

We offer a -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm a little bit

7

still worried about what we discovered at the

8

outset, that at least they are claiming that

9

this order has to say you have authority to

10
11

wiretap in Kansas as well as outside.
So it occurs -- there are two things

12

which worry me.

The first, by the way, it does

13

say in Kansas.

14

the signature of the district judge.

Where it says Kansas is under

15

MR. TRIPP:

Right.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

So it may be that

17

they're thinking, given (3), you know, given

18

what you read us in -- on page 16a where it

19

says a judge can within his territorial

20

jurisdiction authorize a wiretap, that that's

21

good enough.

22

in the statute that you can authorize it within

23

the state you're in, and, therefore, we know

24

this authorizes Kansas.

25

It says he's in Kansas.

It says

Now they're going to say, if they -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

if this were what the argument were about, that

2

isn't good enough.

3

do it.

4

It should say:

And you can

Now what I'm worried about is that

5

there are thousands, that this is a -- this is

6

a form and that there are thousands of wiretap

7

orders, perhaps, throughout the country which

8

do not say in district X; though it says I am a

9

judge in district X, they did -- do not say

10

that you have authority to tap in district X in

11

those words.

12

I'm worried about that because I

13

wouldn't like this case suddenly to cast doubt

14

without argument, you know, full argument -­

15

MR. TRIPP:

Right.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- on those

17

thousands, if there are those thousands.

18

you know?

19

MR. TRIPP:

Do

I would say I'm quite

20

worried about that as well.

21

have extensive empirical evidence of how often

22

we were issuing orders that didn't include that

23

precise language in part because it hadn't been

24

the focus of the case.

25

I guess I don't

I do know that language like this was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

quite common at the relevant time in 2012 when

2

the only judicial precedent interpreting the

3

phrase "mobile interception device" had held

4

that it included the tapped cell phone.

5

it was quite common for orders to include this

6

language saying, yes, you can also put your

7

wire room outside Kansas.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
see that.

Okay.

And so

I got that.

I

There's one other question I have,

10

which is, since that wasn't fully argued, what

11

do you say in response to their argument that

12

these questions of severability and reading, et

13

cetera, while very interesting, were not the

14

subject of any argument below?

15

MR. TRIPP:

Well, so, on that, I think

16

I'd like to echo what Justice Ginsburg pointed

17

out earlier, which is that we -- we won on the

18

basis of severability in the district court.

19

think the clearest indication of that is the

20

magistrate judge's opinion, at page 73a of the

21

Pet. App., where the magistrate judge described

22

it as "academic" whether there was a problem

23

with that additional language in the orders,

24

and then, in the Pet. App. at 64a, the district

25

court said, as applied, the orders did not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official
48
1

violate the statute.

2

And we -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Cox, just so I

3

understand your argument, your argument really

4

is that the core -- the court's approach was

5

right, that the core concern analysis applies

6

to (ii) and (iii), that what we announced in

7

Giordano and -- and -- was it Chavez?

8

MR. TRIPP:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

Chavez -- yeah.
-- that that

inquiry applies to those two subdivisions.

11

MR. TRIPP:

I -- I think -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So let -- let's

13

assume for the sake of argument, because I

14

understand you're saying the only thing needed

15

by the order is subparagraph (iv), that if it

16

misses any one of these four things, we apply

17

the core concerns analysis.

18

MR. TRIPP:

No, I don't think that's a

19

-- that's an accurate description of our

20

position.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

your -- your -- your point?

23

MR. TRIPP:

So what is your -­

So I think it would help

24

if I could clarify what exactly we mean by

25

"insufficient" and "overbroad."

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, I don't want

2

to know those terms.

split is.

4

position contrary to yours in this case, but

5

the D.C. Circuit has said that the core

6

concerns analysis that we used for subdivision

7

(i) doesn't apply to (ii) and (iii).

8

disagree with that?

9

MR. TRIPP:

The D.C. Circuit has said -- taken a

So the way I -- I like to

put it is -- so our front line -­

11
12

I want what the circuit

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, just answer my

question.
MR. TRIPP:

We think that the court of

14

appeals -- to the extent the Chavez and

15

Giordano test is relevant, we think the court

16

of appeals put it in the wrong box.

17

there is no dispute that once you have an order

18

that is insufficient and you're trying to

19

decide whether to suppress tainted evidence on

20

the grounds that the order is insufficient on

21

its face, that Chavez and Giordano do not come

22

into play at that point.

23

Your point is that

this is not insufficient?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. TRIPP:

Our -- right.

Our -- our

2

primary arguments -- our arguments here are

3

that this order was not insufficient and -- and

4

-- and in any event, even you think it was, the

5

error is severable, that -­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Tripp -- I'm

7

sorry, finish your sentence.

8

MR. TRIPP:

9

to be clear about -­

10
11

Well, I -- so I just want

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, if you're really

going to -­

12

MR. TRIPP:

Go -- go ahead.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.

When you say

14

"insufficient," I mean, you know, the Chief

15

Justice raises a very good point that

16

"insufficient" doesn't usually mean invalid,

17

that it usually means lacking something.

18

So then the question is, well, was

19

this order lacking something?

And you say no,

20

it wasn't because it didn't have to have

21

anything about the jurisdictional reach of the

22

interception.

23

concerned listening to you, I mean, if we -- if

24

we accepted that, how are these orders supposed

25

to read?

And I guess I'm a little bit

We're going to go tell every court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

you don't have to put anything in your order

2

about whether this is only within the

3

jurisdiction or outside that jurisdiction?

4

Because, again, there are really two

5

choices in the statute depending upon whether a

6

mobile interception device is -- is at issue.

7

And if we say, well, this is not insufficient

8

because you don't have to have that, what are

9

we going to be creating, a world of orders in

10

which the judge doesn't tell anybody whether

11

this is within the jurisdiction or whether it's

12

also outside the jurisdiction?

13

MR. TRIPP:

No, I don't think that's

14

the upshot of our position.

15

to just point out, as a practical matter, these

16

orders contain a large amount of material that

17

Title III does not actually require them to

18

contain in order for interception of the

19

communications to lawfully occur under Title

20

III.

21

I think one thing

Like the orders in this case, for

22

example, include these recitations of probable

23

cause and necessity and -- and -- and other

24

information that is not strictly required.

25

-- and the government often asks to have that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
52
1

in -- in these orders because, you know, in

2

practice they are heavily picked over.

3

to be sure that the district court knows in

4

advance what it is that we're actually doing.

5

We like

I think actually maybe this is a case

6

where it backfired, where we were, you know,

7

trying to cover our bases, be sure that the

8

district court understand what we -- what we

9

might do in this case.

It so happened that we

10

didn't rely on any of the evidence in this

11

trial that was intercepted from outside Kansas,

12

so I think -- I don't think, by the way, it had

13

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess -­

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the -- if the -- if

16

you were seeking to use a mobile -- a real

17

mobile interception device, would that appear

18

in the application?

19

MR. TRIPP:

I think if we were going

20

to actually seek for approval to put a bug in

21

somebody's car like a mobile interception

22

device in that way, I think it would be clear

23

from the application that that's what we were

24

talking about doing.

25

But the -- the orders -- you know, in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

the applications and the orders, we didn't

2

explain to the court that we were going to be

3

tapping from a wire room on the -- on the basis

4

of a provider cooperation obtained under a

5

different federal statute that the -­

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, when this

7

statute was enacted in 1968, there were no cell

8

phones.

9

what -- under what circumstances the order

So I would think that -- I'm not sure

10

would need to specify where the -- the -- the

11

tap was going to be.

12

It would have to -- it would have to

13

say that you're authorized to tap a particular

14

number, which would be registered at a

15

particular place, so it would be taken care of

16

otherwise.

17

there be circumstances at that time where you

18

needed a separate provision of the order

19

specifying where?

20

Would you need to have a -- would

MR. TRIPP:

No.

I think, you know,

21

the manner in which interception has very much

22

changed in the last 50 years with the change in

23

technology, it is, of course -- I think it's

24

undisputed in this case that the interception

25

of a cell phone occurs wherever we put the wire

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54

room.

2

And, again, I'd like to emphasize that

3

not only did we only use evidence in this case

4

that was intercepted from inside Kansas, we

5

only used evidence in this case under orders

6

where the interception was exclusively inside

7

Kansas.

There were -- there were -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55

MR. TRIPP:

It -- it's more that I

2

think when the statute says that you need to

3

identify -- so each order needs to identify the

4

identity of the person who approved the

5

application and then when the -- the Title III

6

tells you that that has to be a person of, you

7

know -­

8

incorporates that into the requirement.

11

if it were to identify somebody like me or the

13

didn't have the -- the authority, then, no, it

14

would be insufficient as -- as to that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, it's

not permitted under the statute.

3

MR. TRIPP:

I think -- so our -- our

4

-- our definition of what "insufficient" on its

5

face means is that if it is lacking something

6

that is necessary for the government to

7

actually just rely on the orders to intercept

8

the communications at issue, I think in that

9

case it would be quite clear that the order

10

would be lacking something that is necessary

11

for the government to intercept those

12

communications.

13

its face that it was approved by an official

14

who -- who lacked the ability to do that.

15

The order would tell you on

That's actually in -- in response to

16

my brother.

17

where we think the -- the suppression under

18

prong 2 can reach some situations where prong 1

19

would not apply, like if -- if, in fact, an

20

appropriate official had approved it

21

notwithstanding what it said on the face of the

22

order.

23

That's one of the examples of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Tripp, I'd like

24

to ask you about the Glover case, a D.C.

25

Circuit case which is set up as creating a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

split with this decision.

2

Am I wrong in my understanding of

3

Glover that the district court in the District

4

of Columbia authorized something that she had

5

no authority to order because she ordered a bug

6

to be attached to a truck in another

7

jurisdiction?

8
9

So it wasn't a question of
overbreadth.

It was a question that she didn't

10

have authority to order that a bug be placed on

11

-- in a truck in another jurisdiction.

12

MR. TRIPP:

Right.

In -- in -- in

13

Glover, that was a case that involved the use

14

of evidence that -- that -- that was, you know,

15

actually squarely obtained pursuant to the

16

order saying that they could do that.

17

And -- and -- and so, yeah, I think

18

that really -- the -- the circuit conflict -­

19

I'm not sure there really was a circuit

20

conflict.

21

here.

22

trickier questions in this area about, well,

23

what do you do when the government is actually

24

relying on evidence that was obtained outside

25

the jurisdiction, and in particular based on

Obviously, we opposed certiorari

And I think the -- the sort of -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

the misreading of the phrase "a mobile

2

interception device," just none of that is

3

presented here.

4

And I think there -- there are two

5

just much easier threshold ways of resolving

6

this case.

7

the grounds of severability, the

8

straightforward way we won this case below.

9

I think, frankly, the easiest is on

I think the other is just to say that

10

the orders were not insufficient because they

11

-- they did include everything that Title III

12

required them to contain, an order for the

13

government to perform interception inside

14

Kansas, and that's the only evidence we relied

15

on at trial.

16
17
18

I think just one other -- I just want
to clarify one other thing I said earlier.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, if we're

19

talking about easy ways to resolve this case, I

20

have to say the more I think about this, the

21

more it seems really complicated to me, what's

22

supposed to be in these orders and what's not

23

supposed to be in these orders.

24
25

The only thing I'm sure of in this
case is that there's no core concern

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59
1

requirement.

2

So why isn't that the easy way to

3

decide this case and leave everything else for

4

cases where actually people have briefed and

5

addressed these questions of what has to be in

6

and what has to be out and when you can call

7

something insufficient and when not?

8
9

MR. TRIPP:

So, of course, we agree

that the Court could send the case back to the

10

court of appeals on that basis, although I just

11

-- a couple caveats.

12

We agree that, basically as a fall

13

back argument on insufficiency, that the -­

14

that the Chavez and Giordano test is -- is

15

appropriately considered as to whether the

16

order is insufficient on -- in -- in the first

17

I -- I wouldn't want to leave that out.
I think another couple -- couple of

points on this is we've been making these

arguments about -- that the order is not

actually insufficient on its face and that it

-- it just doesn't matter here because we

didn't use any evidence that was intercepted

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

On that one point,

10

might it have been true that you did use some

of the California intercepts from -- that

12

originate from Missouri as part of your general

investigation?

in this case.

Yeah, and this is -- this

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It would be, maybe,

18

fruit of the poison tree argument or something

19

like that.

20

MR. TRIPP:

Yeah, this is something I

21

wanted to clarify.

So -- so we did not use any

22

evidence that was the fruit of the poisonous

23

tree.

24

-- under any order where we did any

25

interception outside Kansas.

We did not use any evidence obtained any

There were 10 orders entered in this

4

For nine of them, including all the

the interception at the DEA headquarters in

8

St. Louis, where there was better Spanish

language capability.

10
11

But we didn't use any

evidence under that order at this trial here.
I think also one -- one point I really

12

do want to emphasize here is that I think our

13

-- our primary interest in this case is in

14

being sure that the Court not adopt

15

Petitioner's very extreme rule where, as -- as

16

long as there is any statutory violation of any

17

kind apparent on the face of an order, then you

18

automatically and mechanically need to suppress

19

all of the evidence obtained under that order

20

no matter what, even when there's no causal

21

link between the error and the interception of

22

the evidence.

23

That would be very damaging.

I think

24

this case is a -- a good example of -- of -- of

25

why that frankly doesn't make all that much

sense.

2

I have a lot of trouble imagining -­

excuse me -- that any Congress would knowingly

enact that rule.

ambiguous.

Petitioner's way.

7

I admit that this statute is

You could potentially read it

But I think, with all due respect to

8

Petitioners, it is also ambiguous and you could

9

read it our way:

10

That insufficiency only means

some errors, not all of them.

11

Only some things make an order

12

insufficient.

13

overbroad, not insufficient.

14

regardless, even if you disagree with that,

15

that -- that you can sever the mistake, the

16

orders here were not insufficient to authorize

17

the interception of these communications inside

18

Kansas, and that's the only evidence we relied

19

on in this trial.

20

Some -- this error just made it
And -- and,

So, if there's no further questions,

I'm asking the Court to affirm.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3
4
5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
The district court in this case

6

exceeded its power under Title III by

7

authorizing what was effectively a nationwide

8

wiretap for the phones at issue.

9

And in doing so, the district court

10

entered orders that under the statute it simply

11

lacked the power to order.

12

here were ultra vires.

The orders at issue

13

Now the government concedes that the

14

orders did not comply with the jurisdictional

15

requirement, and instead it argues that the

16

communications at issue could have been

17

lawfully intercepted if the district court had

18

only entered narrower orders.

19

But if, in fact, that is sufficient to

20

avoid suppression, it's really difficult to see

21

what purpose subparagraph (2) serves in this

22

statute at all.

23

must apply in circumstances in which the

24

communications at issue were, in fact, lawfully

25

intercepted.

Subparagraph (2) by its terms

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

And I would note parenthetically in

2

response to this back and forth both with me

3

and with Mr. Tripp on the issue of what would

4

happen if the orders were completely silent,

5

that it's hard to see how these orders could be

6

silent on something as fundamental as the

7

question of where interception may occur.

8
9

And, if anything, in 1968, well before
the advent of modern mobile telephone

10

technology, you might think that Congress, if

11

anything, would have been more concerned about

12

the risk of forum shopping and more desirous of

13

ensuring that oversight over wiretap orders was

14

performed by the courts with the closest

15

geographic nexus to the investigations at

16

issue.

17

But, again, whatever you think about

18

this question of what would happen when an

19

order is silent, we have orders here that the

20

government no longer defends, that the

21

government recognizes exceeded the district

22

court's power to enter.

23

I would say a -- a -- just a couple of

24

things about the government's argument on the

25

issue of -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On that point, Mr.

2

Shanmugam, there was a legitimate dispute

3

whether the mobile phone itself qualified as

4

whatever the -- the intercept device.

5

was a -- the -- the government took the wrong

6

position on that, it now admits that it was the

7

wrong position, but the courts were confused

8

whether the mobile phone itself constituted the

9

interception device.

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

There

That's right, Justice

11

Ginsburg.

12

before this Court for a good-faith exception.

13

In Footnote 6, the government concedes that

14

that argument was waived below.

15

be the appropriate place to locate any such

16

concern.

17

But the government does not argue

And that would

And so what we're left with is the

18

government really, again, primarily relying on

19

two arguments:

20

of insufficiency, and its severance argument.

The argument about the meaning

21

And on the issue of insufficiency, as

22

I indicated in my opening argument, that would

23

really lead to absurd results.

24
25

And I think the most telling moment in
Mr. Tripp's argument was when he was asked

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

about our hypothetical of an order that

2

authorized a 180-day wiretap, and in response

3

to that, tellingly, he didn't attempt to make

4

the argument that that would not fall within

5

the scope of the phrase "insufficient."

6

turned it to the government's severance

7

argument instead.

8
9

He

And I think that that hypothetical,
and the Chief Justice's hypothetical of an

10

order authorized by Mr. Tripp itself, really

11

illustrates that narrowing insufficiency to

12

exclude overbreadth would really lead to absurd

13

results.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, our legal

15

system usually does not give a party relief

16

based on a mistake that had absolutely no

17

effect on the party.

18

Now I understand that the provision

19

that's directly at issue here is an exception

20

to that.

21

kind of a -- there's some requirements that

22

have to be in the warrant, and whether or not

23

they had any effect whatsoever, the statute

24

says that there has to be suppression.

25

It is a -- it is a list.

It's some

But when you have that kind of a rule

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

that is purely a formal rule, would you not

2

expect to find in the statute a very clear

3

specification of the things that have to be in

4

the warrant, a very clear checklist, so that

5

somebody can be certain that all of those steps

6

are -- are covered, even if they have no

7

effect?

8
9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Alito, that

might be -- may I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Sure.

That might be a better

12

way to write the statute.

13

didn't do that because it scattered those

14

requirements across several subsections.

15

Congress plainly

But I think that your question

16

reflects this concern about the harshness of

17

the rule, the extremeness of the rule.

18

that, I think that we can be certain that what

19

Congress intended to do, as this Court said in

20

Giordano, was to ensure strict compliance with

21

the statute's requirements, and it created a

22

muscular suppression remedy in order to

23

effectuate that goal.

24
25

And on

And we would ask for reversal of the
judgments below.
