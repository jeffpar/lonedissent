ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. KARLAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The government violates the First

12

Amendment whenever it retaliates against

13

someone because they exercise -- criticize

14

public policies or public officials.

15

is so even when the retaliation takes the form

16

of an arrest for which there's probable cause.

17

And this

Section 1983, by its terms, provides

18

an action at law that is a damages action

19

anytime someone is deprived of a right secured

20

by the Constitution.

21

apply here.

22

And that statute should

This Court should not adopt a

23

construction of Section 1983 that essentially

24

lets defendants escape liability for First

25

Amendment violations by claiming that they

didn't violate the Fourth Amendment as well.

Our case shows why an absolute bar

rule is an unacceptable reading of Section 1983

and of the First Amendment.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The case involved

That was true of

Hartman too, but the Court made a distinction.

11

MS. KARLAN:

The distinction in

12

Hartman, as I understand it, Justice Ginsburg,

13

comes and rests entirely on the fact that there

14

was absolute prosecutorial immunity for the

15

actor who actually imposed the injury there.

16

And I see three major distinctions between

17

Hartman and what's going on in this case.

18

The first of those is that, in

19

Hartman, there was absolute prosecutorial

20

immunity.

21

sue the prosecutor; you had to sue somebody

22

upstream.

23

prosecutorial immunity, as this Court explained

24

in the decisions it cited in Hartman, in Reno,

25

and in Wayte, is because the Court wants to

And what that meant is you could not

But the reason why there's absolute

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

avoid inquiry into prosecutorial

2

decision-making, and that's so because

3

prosecutors are both independent and

4

deliberative.

5

Absolutely none of those factors is

6

present in this case.

7

anything a prosecutor has done.

8

here were not made by independent actors.

9

were made by a police officer and by a city

10

council member whose level of animus on the

11

record shows that this was not an arrest about

12

anything that occurred in the court -- in the

13

council chamber that day, and there was no -­

14

You needn't look at

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The decisions
They

So your -- your -­

15

your beginning -- I -- I couldn't quite -­

16

can't quite recall your beginning sentence, but

17

it was hugely broad.

18

for First Amendment protected speech, there's a

19

violation of the Constitution, something to

20

that effect.

Anytime there's an arrest

21

It -- it -- it seems to me that one of

22

the difficulties of this case is that there are

23

any number of hypotheticals you have.

24

people that are fighting in the bar and the -­

25

the policeman has to get some order and the -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

You have

Official
6
1

one of the more difficult suspects says

2

something bad to the policeman, and he arrests

3

him.

Under your view, that's a violation?

4

MS. KARLAN:

No.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That -- that seems

6

-- I'm -- I'm very concerned about police

7

officers in -- in difficult situations where

8

they have to make quick -- and your -- and your

9

initial formulation just did not cover it, just

10

did not give any protection for that.

11

In this case, there's a very serious

12

contention that people in an elected office

13

deliberately wanted to intimidate this person,

14

and it seems to me that maybe in this case we

15

should cordon off, or box off, what happened

16

here from the ordinary conduct of police

17

officers.

18

was so blanket that it didn't provide for that.

19
20
21

And your initial formulation was -­

MS. KARLAN:

I think maybe I -- I

didn't state it clearly enough.
Our position is that when an officer

22

retaliates against someone for his protected

23

speech, that is, when he has what this Court

24

called in Hartman retaliatory animus, and can't

25

show because of the Mt. Healthy standard that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

he would have arrested the person anyway, then

2

there is a First Amendment violation.

3

And if I could point to the empirical

4

evidence here.

The city cites six cases.

The

5

State of Alaska, on page 17 of its brief, cites

6

seven -- it cites 27 cases in the Ninth

7

Circuit.

8

I have read all of those cases, and

9

not a single one of those cases involves the

10

kind of hypothetical that you're talking about.

11

So -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

That may be, but

13

that's -- that's exactly what I had as my

14

question too, that it's not that -- you start

15

-- you're down two tracks, it seemed to me.

16

If you say the police officer is

17

liable, if he really has animus, and the

18

probable cause was not, you know, going to

19

affect him, once you say that, you're into the

20

hypothetical of the bar and all you've done is

21

say the jury will decide all those questions.

22

You get to the jury and the jury has a factual

23

question.

24

true of a real riot where people are out

25

insulting the police and they're breaking

That's true of the bar case.

And if you want us to draw that line,

And if not, how do you deal with Justice

MS. KARLAN:

15

clear that the hypothetical is extraordinarily

16

hypothetical because the cases that are brought

3

MS. KARLAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Which route do you

want us to take?

6

MS. KARLAN:

Those cases are not going

7

to a jury, and the reason those cases are not

8

going to a jury is twofold.

9

First, this Court's pleading rules in

10

Twombly and Iqbal will not let those cases get

11

past a motion to dismiss unless there's direct

12

evidence of the officer saying:

13

don't arrest people under these circumstances,

14

but you I don't like because you're wearing a

15

Make America Great hat or a Black Lives Matter

16

T-shirt or a Choose Life bumper sticker.

are a couple of cases like that with direct

evidence.

Second, as this Court said in Malley

21

against Briggs and has reiterated repeatedly,

22

qualified immunity protects any officer who

23

could legitimately have thought that it was

24

appropriate under these circumstances to

25

arrest.

This case, as I say, is far more

Heritage Reporting Corporation

typical, sadly, of the cases that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that -- would

3

that be the case for this police officer,

4

Aguirre, I mean, he -- the -- the animus is one

person, Wade, the councilmember, and she tells

6

the officer to make an arrest, but the -- the

7

suit is not against the officer, or if it was,

8

wouldn't the officer have qualified immunity?

9

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, Your Honor, the

10

officer here was not a defendant.

defendant is the city.

13

immunity for a city.

Therefore -- I'm sorry.

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, I didn't want to

16

interrupt your -- your answer.

17

MS. KARLAN:

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Oh, no, no.
Well, let's take this

19

particular case then.

Suppose -- obviously,

20

there is no love lost between your client and

21

the City of Riviera Beach, but -- so suppose he

22

comes back to another meeting and he is

23

disruptive and he's arrested.

24

able to file a -- a suit for retaliation and -­

25

and get to the jury on that?

Will he not be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

MS. KARLAN:

It might be very

2

difficult for him to get to a jury if the level

3

of disruption is such that, under the way this

4

Court has treated plausible pleading in Twombly

5

and Iqbal, it's not plausible to believe that

6

it was the animus that caused the arrest.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you really think a

8

suit like that could be dismissed under

9

Twombly?

10

MS. KARLAN:

I'm seeing the cases from

11

the Ninth Circuit being dismissed all the time

12

on the grounds that it's just not plausible.

13

And if you have a serious crime, it

14

truly isn't plausible to claim that it's

15

animus.

16

cases where somebody is charged with mayhem and

17

argue -- argues successfully.

18

So you don't see, for example, any

JUSTICE BREYER:

But those are cases

19

that have been brought.

20

obviously, is some kind of rule that will

21

change what has been brought.

22

What we're worried,

In the back of my mind, to put sort of

23

every card on the table, is I was thinking of

24

what Justice Ginsburg wrote in a concurrence in

25

Reichle.

Do you know that case?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

MS. KARLAN:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MS. KARLAN:

Is that how it's

4

pronounced?

5

thought it was Reichle.

6
7

I should have looked it up.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Reichle.

I

I don't

know.

8

MS. KARLAN:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Of course.

Yeah.
Sorry.

I'm not very

good on pronunciation.

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

But -- but in

13

Reichle, Justice Ginsburg wrote a concurrence

14

that I joined that tried to draw a separation

15

between cases like yours and the cases that

16

Justice Kennedy and -- and I had been most

17

concerned about, the riot cases, et cetera.

18

Now -- now what do you think of that?

19

MS. KARLAN:

Can I suggest that you

20

look at page 12 of the Joint Appendix in

21

Reichle, because there you will see the

22

complaint, which was a pre-Twombly, pre-Iqbal

23

complaint.

24

complaint, not one from which you could infer

25

that there was animus.

There are no facts alleged in that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

And I think Justice Ginsburg's

2

concurrence which you join there is absolutely

3

right.

4

would have been required to stop Mr. Howards

5

regardless.

Those officers under that circumstance

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8
9

Do you really

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if you're

telling me -- excuse me, Chief Justice.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you really

11

think that Twombly and Iqbal require the degree

12

of specificity that you postulated, that the

13

only cases that are going to be successfully

14

brought are when the person has a hat on that

15

says that he's a member of a particular group,

16

and the officer says:

17

people, but because of your hat with a

18

political message, I'm going to arrest you?

I don't normally arrest

19

Do you really think -- is it a bit of

20

an exaggeration when you say Twombly and Iqbal

21

are going to keep everything but that case out

22

of court?

23

MS. KARLAN:

I'm not saying it will

24

keep everything out.

There are two kinds of

25

cases that will go forward.

There are the ones

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

where the officer says things like -- and these

2

are the cases in the Ninth Circuit that have

3

been allowed to go forward -- I normally don't

4

arrest people, but I don't like your attitude,

5

or I normally don't arrest people, but we

6

should have arrested you a long time ago.

7

there are two kinds of cases that I think will

8

go forward after Twombly and Iqbal.

9

So

The first are these ones where

10

somebody can plead with specificity something

11

that the officer said or something that the

12

city councilmember said that has animus.

13

The second are -­

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, just -- just

15

so -- just so you know, and it's in line with

16

the Chief Justice, if you say that the only box

17

you're going to draw for me in this case

18

between the -- to distinguish between the class

19

of cases Justice Breyer and I were discussing

20

and this case is Twombly and Iqbal, you've lost

21

me.

22

MS. KARLAN:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

Because there

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- it seems to me,

2

to take care of the broad proposition that you

3

began with, and I was curious to know if you

4

have some fallback position so that when there

5

is an allegation, a strong allegation of -- of

6

a deliberate animus by elected officials, and

7

the police officer is a young police officer,

8

he just acts based on their -- on -- on their

9

orders, whether or not that is some special

10

kind of case?

11

show me that it is.

And this Court has a robust

If you'll remember this Court's

21

formulation in Malley against Briggs of

22

qualified immunity, it's all but the willful

23

and the ignorant.

24
25

And the third thing that gets rid of
these cases is the Mt. Healthy standard, which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

is, if it is a case where they would have

2

arrested regardless of the animus, that is a

3

case where the defendant will win.

4
5

If I could return to the second part
of what I wanted to say to the Chief Justice -­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You -- you said, Ms.

7

Karlan, that this would not -- never apply.

8

You think that in serious crimes this would

9

never get to a jury.

10

you?

11
12

Did I -- did I mishear

MS. KARLAN:

I think that's -- that's

correct.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

MS. KARLAN:

Why is that?

Because it would not be

15

plausible to say, unless you had extraordinary

16

evidence of animus, that a police officer would

17

not arrest somebody for rape or burglary or

18

murder, things -- serious crimes like that.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think it would

20

be appropriate for us to say something, if we

21

were to rule in your client's favor, that with

22

respect to felonies, this -- this should -- we

23

don't expect this to go to juries much, if at

24

all?

25

MS. KARLAN:

Well, certainly, that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

would require reversal in our case.

"felony," as you know, is an extraordinarily

broad word.

are felonies that the Court would not view as

11

cases because it's just not plausible to

12

believe that the officer was clearly violating

13

the First Amendment.

14

Could I -­

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, we get a

16

lot of cases, particularly from where you've

17

said, the cases you've looked at, where

18

qualified immunity is applied in a case where

19

we found it necessary to -- to reverse.

20

I'm not sure that it's as solidly

21

established a doctrine as -- as you suggest to

22

protect -- to -- to leave -- we can allow this

23

action because qualified immunity will take

24

care of the -- the problems.

25

MS. KARLAN:

I -- I think the main

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

thing to focus on here is, if you adopt an

2

absolute bar rule, which is the rule that the

3

Eleventh Circuit has, you're not just knocking

4

out close cases, you're knocking out cases

5

where courts have found that there is a

6

long-standing animus, that there was no

7

justification.

8
9

And in this case, the city is asking
for far more than Hartman, because in Hartman,

10

all he had to show was there was no probable

11

cause for the arrest of prosecution.

12

Here, the city wants us to show not

13

only that there was no probable cause for the

14

only crimes with which my client was ever

15

charged, but there was no probable cause for

16

anything anywhere in the Florida statutes.

17

And that is an extraordinarily broad

18

rule that says to city councilmembers and says

19

to cities -- if I could use a case, Justice

20

Breyer, in which you wrote the opinion last

year -- in Heffernan, you said it's a First

JUSTICE BREYER:

You've got the facts.

6

Of course, your case is quite different from

7

what's worrying me and what's worrying me and I

8

think Justice Kennedy perhaps, and that is

9

imagine a serious riot situation.

10

They exist.

And in that riot situation, where the

11

police have a problem because there's a

12

sub-gang and the sub-gang is going around

13

breaking windows and setting fire to things,

14

they can't arrest everybody in the sub-gang.

15

There are too many of them.

16

Okay?

So it's not going to be true that the

13

there some words in this opinion that would

14

favor you hypothetically that would wall off

15

that case from decision now?

16

MS. KARLAN:

Okay?

So is

I think the answer is

17

yes.

18

no absolute bar and that in cases where an

19

officer confronts serious -- serious conditions

20

that have to be addressed at the moment, he's

21

entitled to qualified immunity.

22

This Court can hold that there should be

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I think, Ms.

23

Karlan, that the -- the reference in Reichle

24

that Justice Breyer was referring to talks

25

about swift on-the-spot decisions where the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21

safety of persons is in jeopardy.

2
3

Is that the sort of language that you
think would be appropriate to -­

4

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, it -­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- guard against the

6

kind of hypotheticals that Justice Breyer and

7

Justice Kennedy are talking about?

8
9

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, I think you can say

there is no absolute bar, but we understand

10

that when there is a danger to people and when

11

an officer has to make split-second decisions,

12

he's entitled either to judgment on a 12(b)(6)

13

motion or he's entitled to qualified immunity

14

or he's entitled to summary judgment.

15

doesn't justify having an absolute bar in all

16

cases.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

But that

I -- I need some help

18

with what you've said about qualified immunity

19

because I -- I legitimately don't understand

20

it.

21

I -- I don't think there's ever a

22

situation in which a reasonable officer could

23

think that it is lawful to retaliate based on

24

the exercise of First Amendment rights.

25

there is in a case a genuine issue about the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So, if

Official
22
1

officer's motivation, I don't see how the

2

officer will ever be able to get dismissal

3

based on qualified immunity.

4

MS. KARLAN:

Well, in the case where

5

there is a legitimate dispute over whether the

6

officer acted with retaliatory animus, he will

7

not be able to get qualified immunity -­

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MS. KARLAN:

10

Right.

So -­

-- but that's different.

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- qualified immunity

11

doesn't -- well -- yeah, qualified immunity

12

won't help in that situation.

13

case where -- that you -- you can say there's

14

no genuine dispute on the issue of the

15

officer's motivation.

16

evidence, circumstantial evidence, of -- of

17

retaliatory motive, such as the person who's

18

arrested saying something that's insulting to

19

the officer, you're going to be able to infer

20

that.

21

MS. KARLAN:

So it's only the

And if there's any

I -- I don't think it's

22

fair to say you'll be able to infer it under

23

those circumstances.

24

officers under conditions of stress where

25

somebody says something inappropriate to them,

That is, I've seen police

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

and they don't say anything back, and they

2

arrest the person who's committing a crime.

3

Under those circumstances, I honestly

4

believe that the point this Court makes in

5

Twombly and Iqbal is when the officer's actions

6

and all that the plaintiff can allege are

7

equally consistent with a lawful and an

8

unlawful behavior by the officer, Twombly and

9

Iqbal should require dismissal.

10

And I think if you look at what

11

district court judges in the Ninth Circuit are

12

doing, they are not allowing cases to go

13

forward.

14

that the State of Alaska cites, and in 12 of

15

those cases -- I think it's either 10 or 12 -­

16

the district court dismissed the case either on

17

a 12(b)(6) motion or on a summary judgment on

18

the grounds that there was not sufficient

19

evidence to go to a jury on retaliatory animus.

20

If you look -- I read all 27 cases

And in most of the cases -- it's

21

important for this Court to understand, in most

22

of the cases that go forward, as in our case,

23

there is a Fourth Amendment claim as well.

24

People are not just bringing the First

25

Amendment claim.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

Indeed, eight days into the trial in

2

this case, our client was entitled to judgment

3

as a matter of law on his Fourth Amendment

4

probable cause claim and was entitled to go

5

forward on his First Amendment claim as well.

6

And the problem here is that the

7

absolute bar rule takes a lot of cases that are

8

quite like our case.

9

extraordinary is you can watch the video and

10

you can read the transcript, but there are a

11

lot of other video cases out there now like

12

ours.

13

What makes our case

And if I could just suggest to the

7

anything other than Iqbal and Twombly and

8

qualified immunity to confine it in any way.

9

I think you have a -- a

MS. KARLAN:

No, I think all you have

10

to say here is there is no absolute bar rule.

11

That's all we're asking the Court to do, is to

12

say the Eleventh Circuit's rule is wrong.

13

The Ninth Circuit's rule, which is a

14

workable rule, says probable cause is a

15

relevant factor.

16

cases a dispositive factor.

17

relevant and where it's not dispositive, a

18

strong First Amendment case should go forward

19

because, otherwise, what this Court is really

20

saying is:

21

an independent expenditure.

arrest you and they can hold you for two days

4

and they can strip-search you and then they can

5

say to you:

6

And if that's what the First Amendment

7

means, then all of the protections that this

8

Court is giving don't mean very much on the

9

ground when you're dealing with local

10
11

governments.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I was

12

surprised you didn't make more of the fact that

13

the basis for probable cause that the city

14

eventually came up with, disturbing the

15

assembly, was not one that they -- the officer,

16

I don't know exactly where, listed or advanced

17

as their justification.

18

arrest or disorderly conduct.

19

couldn't figure out what to make of it either.

20

It just seemed very -- it seemed very odd to me

21

that that was in the case.

22

MS. KARLAN:

You know, resisting
But then I

I -- I think what's going

23

on there is that if you have to show a Fourth

24

Amendment violation in order to show a First

25

Amendment violation, we're kind of tied in by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

Devenpeck because what this Court said there is

2

you don't need to have probable cause for the

3

-- for the offense of arrest in order to defeat

4

a Fourth Amendment claim.

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Any probable -­
That's true in the

6

Fourth Amendment context, but would it

7

necessarily hold in the First Amendment

8

context, I believe is the Chief Justice's

9

question?

10

MS. KARLAN:

Sure.

And you could

11

reverse in this case on the grounds that you're

12

going to apply Hartman as written and not add a

13

kind of Devenpeck chaser to it, if you will.

would say, well, in Hartman, it was the

Devenpeck, though, as -- if I remember here,

the -- the sergeant, I think, or whomever

initially looked at the case said there is

14

grounds for probable cause, but we're not going

15

to get a conviction, so that's why we're not

16

going to proceed.

17

Now the judge said there's no probable

18

cause on the facts as they existed, but you can

19

well imagine that officers filled with animus

20

could scour the books at the booking station

21

and they could look for something that might

22

fit the day as well but still not have been

23

something they would have otherwise arrested

24

for.

25

MS. KARLAN:

Sure, which is why we

think the best rule is that probable cause is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10
11
12

MR. DVORETZKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

-- and may it please the Court:
During Ms. Karlan's argument, I wrote

13

-- wrote down four potential backstops to

14

address the hypothetical -- the hypothetical

15

that Justice Kennedy raised and that Justice

16

Breyer echoed about a police officer dealing

17

with a riot in a bar.

18

none of the four that I wrote down are

19

sufficient and why the long-standing common law

20

rule and the rule in Hartman ought to be the

21

one that applies here.

22

I'd like to explain why

The four that I wrote down were

23

pleading standards, qualified immunity,

24

Mt. Healthy, and a distinction between felonies

25

or major crimes and other crimes.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

First, with respect to the pleading

2

standards, it's critical to understand that

3

police officers must concededly take account of

4

speech when deciding whether to arrest in many

5

situations.

6

The bar example is one of those.

And police officers need to have an

7

objective -- an objective basis on which their

8

conduct will be judged.

9

impossible for police officers themselves in

It -- it is virtually

10

the bar kind of situation to disaggregate their

11

own thought processes and understand whether -­

12

and re-create after the fact, certainly,

13

whether they carried out an arrest because of

14

the -- the content of somebody's speech and

15

their dislike for it, or because the content of

16

somebody's speech suggested belligerence and

17

suggested a likelihood to -- to continue to

18

incite violence and there was a need to arrest

19

in order to contain the situation.

20

The problem with a pleading standard

21

rule, as the Ninth Circuit demonstrates, is

22

that there are many cases in which police

23

officers and arrestees simply have a different

24

view of what happened.

25

sends those cases to juries, and, regularly,

And the Ninth Circuit

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

the juries ultimately find for the police

2

officers but only after they've been forced to

3

endure all of the burdens of litigation.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dvoretzky, I want

5

to give you an opportunity to address each of

6

your four if you want, but -- but if I may say,

7

I mean, Ms. Karlan was having some difficulty

8

with hypotheticals.

9

difficulty with the facts of your case.

10

But you might have some
So if

I could -­

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- move you to the

13

facts of your case and suggest the kind of

14

dangers that it poses, which is that in a local

15

government, there are people who become real

16

sort of pains to local officials, and -- and

17

local officials want to retaliate against them,

18

for all the various things they say, charging

19

corruption, doing whatever Mr. Lozman did.

20

sure that there's one in every town.

21

the nature of our lives and the nature of our

22

criminal statute books, there's a lot to be

23

arrested for.

24

(Laughter.)

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm

And just

So you follow somebody

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

around and they commit a traffic violation of a

2

pretty minor kind, and all of a sudden you're

3

sitting in jail for 48 hours before they decide

4

to release you.

5

So that's a pretty big problem, it

6

seems to me, and it's right here in kind of the

7

facts of this case.

8

respond to that.

9

So I guess I'd like you to

MR. DVORETZKY:

Justice Kagan, let me

10

respond to that, first, in terms of the facts

11

of this case and then more generally about the

12

legal rule that ought to be -- that ought to be

13

drawn here.

14

A couple of critical things about the

15

facts of this case.

One, Officer Aguirre

16

testified that he made the independent decision

17

to arrest Mr. Lozman and that he had never

18

heard of Mr. Lozman before the incident in

19

which this arrest took place.

20

Second -­

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

arrest?

23

officer?

24
25

Wasn't he told to

Didn't Wade say call -- call the

MR. DVORETZKY:

Councilperson Wade

said call the officer, but Officer Aguirre made

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

the decision to arrest.

Just because somebody

2

calls the police doesn't mean that the police

3

will actually act on that, especially where

4

here the testimony was that Officer Aguirre

5

made the independent decision and had to make

6

the independent decision.

7

He could not -­

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let's -- let's

9

assume that this officer has qualified immunity

10

and that perhaps he didn't even violate the law

11

anyway.

12

What about the city council?
MR. DVORETZKY:

So the city council -­

13

first, we could discuss the transcript.

14

the transcript that Ms. Karlan relies on does

15

not support the notion of a -- a scheme to get

16

at Mr. Lozman.

17

I -­

There -- there was one comment by one

18

city councilperson expressing frustration,

19

followed by five or six pages of transcript

20

testimony in which the city councilmembers

21

agreed to put all of the resources they needed

22

into the litigation and to defeat the

23

litigation.

24
25

That is what they agreed to do.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're talking

about the closed -- the closed meeting?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

MR. DVORETZKY:

Correct.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

MR. DVORETZKY:

Okay.

And if, in fact, there

4

were some sort of a plan to get at Mr. Lozman,

5

why would the city council have let him speak

6

uninterrupted many times, both before and after

7

the particular incident that was at issue here?

8
9

And why would the jury have found in
the city's favor not only on this claim but

10

also on the other forms of Mr. -- of

11

retaliation that Mr. Lozman alleged?

12

So, on the facts of this case, first

13

of all, I dispute Ms. Karlan's characterization

14

of them.

15

Court, as in Hartman, should not make a general

16

rule for the facts of this case.

17

--

18

Second, and more importantly, the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

As the court

Well,

19

regardless of what happened before or after, I

20

found the video pretty chilling.

21

fellow is up there for about 15 seconds, and

22

the next thing he knows, he's being led off in

23

-- in -- in handcuffs, speaking in a very calm

24

voice the whole time.

25

I mean, the

Now the council may not have liked

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

what he was talking about, but that doesn't

2

mean they get to cuff him and -- and lead him

3

out.

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, the -- there was

5

probable cause in that situation to arrest him

6

for unlawful disturbance.

7

to heed Ms. Wade's and Officer Aguirre's

8

directions to stay on topic.

9

He repeatedly failed

There -- there was a finding by the

10

district court here that comments -­

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

He was on topic.

12

Assume that fact.

He started by saying:

13

There's been arrest -- an arrest for

14

corruption, which was true.

15

to say:

16

people are corrupt.

And then he tried

And I've been telling you that other

17

Why is that off topic?

18

MR. DVORETZKY:

Because the corruption

19

that he alleged related to Palm Beach County

20

corruption.

21

the -- the topics to be addressed at these

22

meetings had to relate to topics related to the

23

city, not related to the county.

24
25

And as the district court found,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The city is within

the county?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. DVORETZKY:

The city is within the

policy drew.

5

not county officials.

6

It's a city council meeting to

The -- the more fundamental point

7

here, though, is that, as in Hartman, the Court

8

in -- in Footnote 10 in Hartman put it rather

9

colorfully.

You don't design a retirement

10

system because you might win the lottery, which

11

is to say you don't design the general rule for

12

the extremely rare one-off case, particularly

13

when -­

14
15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, though,

that -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Hartman -­

17

Hartman turned very much on the -- the

18

prosecutor and the assurance that the

19

prosecutor is going to be a check against -­

20

you know, you had the postal inspectors and -­

21

but it was the prosecutor who made the decision

22

to prosecute.

23

And here there's no one like the

24

prosecutor who has absolute immunity and is a

25

-- is a person that we generally think of as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

upright.

2

The -- the arrest, at least it looked like from

3

the tape, was motivated by Wade, who was just

4

very annoyed at Mr. Lozman.

5

And here there's nothing like that.

MR. DVORETZKY:

Justice Ginsburg, I

6

respectfully disagree with that

7

characterization of Hartman.

8

Court said that the prosecutorial immunity was

9

an added reason for the rule that the Court

In Hartman, the

10

adopted, but the heart of the Court's analysis

11

in Hartman was about causation.

the complex causation problems that arose in

the prosecutor to act.

It was about

You

Here, you have at least as significant

21

arrests, whether for major crimes or for minor

22

crimes, out of fear that later on there will be

23

an allegation that perhaps the real reason for

24

the arrest was the Black Lives Matter shirt or

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I'm sorry, we

2

don't -- we don't disagree that police officers

3

shouldn't be arresting for retaliatory intent.

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

Correct.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -­

All right.

Now,

6

if we accept that premise that the First

7

Amendment is valuable enough to us to protect

8

it from government abuse and -- and the facts

9

in this case, that's what they assumed or

10

that's what we're assuming from the facts as

11

alleged, shouldn't we have a remedy and

12

shouldn't we have a remedy that takes care of

13

those arrests that are motivated solely because

14

of animus, because Mt. Healthy says if you

15

would have arrested anyway, you're not liable.

16

But what you're doing is depriving

17

people who would not have been arrested except

18

for their First Amendment speech from having

19

any remedy whatsoever.

there is an epidemic of retaliatory arrests out

3

there that -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

I'm not even

5

talking about an epidemic.

I'm talking about a

6

constitutional wrong, because either way you're

7

saying we shouldn't create a system for this

8

kind of violation, but why should I create a

9

system to exempt this from our regular First

10

Amendment process, because there might be one

11

or a few cases that fall through the protective

12

barriers that Ms. Karlan pointed to?

13

MR. DVORETZKY:

First, because there

14

is no workable system to carve off just this

15

case from the mine-run bar incident case.

Second, because there are other

remedies besides damages actions in individual

2

to arrest somebody on account of his political

speech in a political forum.

And it seems to me that that is a very

serious First Amendment problem.

And it seems

to me you can cabin that off somehow from the

bar institute.

any specific way to do that, other than

Twombly, but it seems to me that -- that the

The Petitioners didn't give us

court in order to protect speech in the

11

political forum can make that distinction, at

12

least in this case, maybe wait for other cases

13

to see if it should be expanded.

14

MR. DVORETZKY:

Justice Kennedy, as in

15

Hartman, the Court said it was not possible to

16

create a workable system that would cabin off a

17

particular kind of speech or a particular kind

18

of violation.

19

either.

I don't believe there is here

20

If you look at the instances that in

21

the Ninth Circuit have gone to trial, many of

22

those involve political speech as well.

23

Consider, for example, the Ballentine case

24

cited -- cited in our brief.

25

where protestors were repeatedly chalking the

That was the case

a form of political speech.

3

repeatedly tried to work with them and to

4

suggest instead of chalking, use this other

5

form of protest.

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The police

But, counsel, why

7

doesn't it account for your concerns what the

8

Chief Justice suggested, which is perhaps

9

probable cause to arrest for the charge made

10

would tend to defeat an inference of

11

retaliation, but to imagine probable cause for

12

an offense ginned up years later at trial after

13

scouring the books and the judge sending

14

everyone to do more homework to find more

15

statutes and more books.

16
17
18
19
20

Why might that not be different and
that raise an inference of retaliation?
MR. DVORETZKY:

Because, Justice

Gorsuch, of the teaching of Devenpeck that -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, that's the -­

21

that's the Fourth Amendment context.

22

we're trying to secure First Amendment values.

23

And --- and why isn't it a different

24

consideration?

25

MR. DVORETZKY:

Here,

It is in the Fourth

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

Amendment, but the core teaching of it is -- is

2

that police officers are not lawyers.

3

they are trained to do is to identify a course

4

of conduct and determine whether there's

5

probable cause that some unlawful -- that some

6

law was broken during that time, but they are

7

not trained and they are not required to

8

specifically identify at the time of the arrest

9

precisely what section of the code was

10

What

violated.

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

For certain.

And

12

I'm not suggesting that the failure to get it

13

right would itself invite liability, but why

14

wouldn't it at least raise the possible

15

inference of retaliation there in a way that it

16

wouldn't if it got it right for the arresting

17

charge?

18

MR. DVORETZKY:

Again, because police

19

officers simply are not trained to think in

20

that particular mindset.

21

officer sees me have a car accident and

22

determines that I am at fault for it, the

23

police officer is not required at that moment

24

to be thinking -­

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

If -- if a police

No, fair enough.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

You didn't get it at the moment, and maybe you

2

give him a couple of chances even at the apple.

3

But do you -- do you wait until trial and -­

4

and in the middle of trial and sending lawyers

5

to do homework to find more charges?

6

does that -- is that different in any

7

meaningful way?

8
9

MR. DVORETZKY:

Does -­

Justice Gorsuch, the

only reason that this was all determined at

10

trial is that Mr. Lozman, before trial, did not

11

serve us with interrogatories and ask us

12

specifically what offenses we were claiming

13

probable cause for.

14

He could have done that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

If that doesn't -- if

15

that doesn't work, what you started out, and I

16

wanted to hear your answer, and this is just

17

one add to the mix, but the mix, it seems to

18

me, consists, for the bar and riot cases, et

19

cetera, one, they say start with the

20

Mt. Healthy framework.

21

Three, you have qualified immunity.

22

Two, you have Iqbal.

Justice Gorsuch added what he just

23

said to that.

And I would add and the officer,

24

it's a special situation, which either we don't

25

reach or it's okay or you use the Fourth

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

Amendment or whatever, where the officer must

2

make singularly swift on-the-spot decisions and

3

the safety of persons or property is at issue.

4

Okay?

5

Now suppose -- I don't see anything

6

too terrible about writing those.

And what

7

harm would be done?

8

your case, which I consider perhaps you would

9

consider a serious harm, but -­

You would, of course, lose

10

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- but -- but none -­

12

none -- none -- nonetheless, what -- what harm

13

would happen to the interests that you've heard

14

articulated?

15

MR. DVORETZKY:

The harm that would

16

happen is that this Court has repeatedly

17

recognized that police officers need objective

18

bright-line rules, not five- or six- or

19

seven-factor tests that they then need to apply

20

on the ground.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't mean it as a

22

five- or six- or seven-factor test.

What I

23

really meant you to focus on was the last one

24

because I've heard discussion on the others,

25

and that is the police officer does have the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

immunity that they search in the situation

2

where -- and I could repeat it, but maybe you

3

wrote it down -- but it's -- it's that -- well,

I'll repeat it if you want.

singular need for a swift on-the-spot decision

As -- I

did go through the list that the Alaska brief

formed and the six that you -- that you listed.

20

It seems to me that having read those cases,

21

that they went to trial not because those

22

limitations failed but because there was other

23

evidence of things that -- that -- that didn't

24

fail but made this triable cases.

25

involved excessive force claims, which can

Many of them

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

often be reflective of animus in a different

2

way than a mere arrest is.

3

And as was pointed out by your

adversary, of the 26 the Alaska brief pointed

5

to, 12 of them were dismissed at the motion to

So people bring things, but it

sometimes they're not.

Sometimes they are and
Far too often, they are

10

viable through trial and only at that point

11

does a jury find in favor of the officers.

12

And in many of these cases, the basis

13

for finding a triable question was simply that

14

the police officer was aware of the content of

15

some speech, and that was enough in order to

16

create an inference that maybe the real reason

17

for the arrest was not that the arrestee -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I'm sorry, we

19

have -- we have a difference of opinion and

20

perhaps -- I don't think I have to recite each

21

-- go through each case, but I don't think that

22

was merely the reason in most, if not all, of

23

them.

24
25

MR. DVORETZKY:

I -- I think if you

look at cases like Holland or the chalking case

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

or Mihailovici, those are cases where the

2

reason that there was a triable question was

3

simply a difference of opinion about what

4

happened.

5

qualified immunity will not do any work to

6

protect police officers if Mr. Lozman's rule

7

becomes the law.

8
9

And that is also precisely why

At that point in the typical case, the
only thing left to be tried, if there's an

10

allegation of a retaliatory motive, is what was

11

the real motive in the officer's head?

12

not something to which qualified immunity

13

attaches.

14

for a jury.

15

That's

That is going to be a fact question

With respect to the suggestion that

16

Justice Kagan raised earlier between major and

17

minor crimes, police officers can't have a

18

taxonomy in mind of what's a significant enough

19

crime to arrest for and what's not.

20

And, moreover, even some seemingly

21

minor crimes, as the amicus brief for the

22

District of Columbia and numerous states points

23

out, even some seemingly minor crimes can be

24

very important to enforce for community

25

policing concerns.

And so the idea of having a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

test where only -- where major crimes, the

2

police officer somehow gets more deference than

3

for minor -- minor crimes doesn't work in

4

practice.

5

I'd also like to point out that the -­

6

Mr. Lozman and his amici have surveyed decades

7

of cases.

case, not even one, in which a police officer

9

has been held liable for a retaliatory arrest

They've not come up with a single

that was supported by probable cause.

animus against Lozman.

on the part of the city council, not the

19

arresting officer.

20

As far as I know, no one charged the

The charge was that the

The -- the animus here was

MR. DVORETZKY:

If I may briefly

21

respond.

The alleged animus was on the part of

22

the city council, but in order to have a

23

complete violation, it would need to be carried

24

out by the officer, which requires an inquiry

25

into the officer's state of mind and the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49

officer's intent.

2

More -- moreover, there's no basis for

distinguishing cases against police officers

the text of 1983 or the history of these sorts

of actions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL,

11

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

12
13
14
15

IN SUPPORT OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I have three points.

The latter two

16

are about law, and I hope I'll get to them, but

17

I want to start with what the world looks like

18

because I think there's a serious disagreement

19

here and this case arises on about the worst

20

possible facts, and I would hate to see that

21

drive the rule.

22

There are about 10 to 11 million

23

arrests every year in the country.

Of those,

24

Petitioner and his amici have come forward with

25

20 cases in their briefs, and I'd encourage -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

encourage the Court to look at them because I

2

-- I'm perfectly happy to rise or fall by them.

3

They divide down, I think, into three

4

basic buckets:

5

cases, and other cases where there's a

6

confrontation between the arrestee and the

7

officer and there's a failure to follow a

8

lawful order, and the question is:

9

motivated the arrest, the failure to follow the

10

protest cases, noise ordinance

What

order or the speech?

11

And I think what we're trying -- what

12

-- what -- what the United States would submit

13

is Twombly and Iqbal are not going to work for

14

the reasons they haven't worked in the lower

15

courts.

16

their speech.

17

things about the interaction with the officer,

18

and many courts have deemed that sufficient to

19

get past the pleadings stage.

20

The plaintiffs never just point to
They always point to other

Qualified immunity isn't going to work

21

for the reasons Justice Alito gave.

I don't

22

think the language in Reichle is going to work

23

because that was designed for protective

24

details.

25

even the officer's decision on the city council

These are all on-the-spot decisions,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

here.

And a lot of these cases don't involve

2

the safety of persons or property.

3

I mean, take a case like Galarnyk that

4

went all the way to the Eighth Circuit.

5

Somebody trespassed into a government trailer

6

in order to criticize the government.

7

question is -- no question he was

8

trespassing -- did they arrest him for that or

9

because, once he got inside the trailer, he was

10

And the

criticizing people working in the trailer?

11

I -- I don't know that you could say

12

that there was a real safety concern there.

13

And there's no property concern in any of the

14

noise ordinance cases or even a lot of the

15

protest cases.

16

I'd really caution the Court away from

17

addressing the Devenpeck rule here.

18

hasn't challenged it.

19

question.

20

whether you need to show an absence of probable

21

cause, what offenses you should have to show

22

that for.

23

why the rationale of Devenpeck should apply

24

here regardless.

25

Petitioner

It's a very difficult

It's a very different question from

I think there are very good reasons

So then I think you're really just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

down to what Justice Kennedy was getting at,

2

which is, look, this looks like an official

3

policy of the municipality, and, indeed, the

4

parties seem to agree that's what the jury

5

found.

6

And I think you could rest it on that,

7

although for the reasons that the city's

8

council gave, there's no textual or historical

9

support for that in the statute or at common

10

law.

And I think Hartman's Footnote 10 already

11

says we designed the constitutional tort for

12

the mine-run of cases, not for the needle in

13

the haystack.

14

And this case really is.

I mean, it

15

-- really, I agree, that the facts here are

16

troubling.

17

almost a category of one.

18

look like the typical cases for which you

19

designed the constitutional tort rule.

20

that's what Hartman tells us.

I also just think that this is
It just does not

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well -­

Mr. Wall, we allow

23

24

25

without showing anything about whether probable

Official
53

2

cause exists or not.
What has been the experience with

3

respect to those cases?

4

area -- why should the rule be any different

5

than that one?

6

MR. WALL:

And why is this

So I think what we'd say is

7

different for a couple of reasons but one

8

similarity, and this was one of the legal

9

points I wanted to make.

10

Those cases are about race.

Race, the

11

Court has said, is so rarely a proper

12

consideration for officers that the Court does

13

treat them differently.

14

Speech is the kind of thing that

15

officers often can and must in these situations

16

take account of.

17

it's more subjective than in virtually every

18

other context, even there you've got the

19

objective screen of Armstrong.

20

got to prove that similarly situated people

21

were treated differently.

22

And even there, even though

So you've still

And I think, setting aside the facts

23

of this case, the legal anomaly that Petitioner

24

wants is to say:

25

constitutional tort claim, retaliatory

Look, for every other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

prosecution claims under the First Amendment,

2

selective enforcement under the Fourteenth, or

3

false arrests under the Fourth, you've got some

4

objective screen, whether it's the absence of

5

probable cause, whether it's Armstrong's

6

similarly situated requirement.

7

And what they're really saying is for

8

this subcategory of claims under the First

9

Amendment, no objective screen.

10

Fact question.

It's going to go to

11

the jury.

to arrest me until I called him names and I

And all of these cases are virtually
The officer wasn't going

And the officer said:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One of the

18

grounds, and I don't -- I'm not quite sure how

19

you could use it, we've been talking about how

20

bad the facts are and yet how difficult it is

21

to apply.

22

This is not a situation where the

23

police are out in the street and something's

24

happened and they're looking at the, you know,

25

what kind of slogans they have, what they're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

shouting, a lot's going on.
This is, you know, in the city

council, during a time specifically set aside

4

for citizens to talk about whatever the council

5

is talking about and comment on it.

6

any basis there for limiting it to the, it

7

seems to me, intensely free speech environment

8

that we're talking about?

9

MR. WALL:

Is there

So maybe right there at the

10

tail end, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

understand the impulse.

12

with the on-the-spot language is that even here

13

the officer's making an on-the-spot decision.

14

I mean, I

I think the difficulty

You -- you could try to limit that to

15

-- I don't know that "in the field" would

16

capture it because it -- I'm not sure there's a

17

difference between -- I'm not sure how the

18

Court would get into what's in the field and -­

19

and what's not, whether you're in the field

20

when you're in the government trailer or when

21

you're out on the streets, but you're not in

22

the city council meeting.

23

You could try to tie it to the nature

24

of the city council meeting, the fact that you

25

both had the official policy and that it was in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

the context of a meeting where people were

2

designed to air grievances or talk about what

3

they wanted against the city.

4

Again, I don't think that's gotten

5

much textual historical support behind it.

6

Hartman specifically said:

7

we're not going to design this thing for the

8

one-in-a-thousand case.

9

important here, because it's so much easier to

Look, we're -­

And I think even more

10

allege retaliatory arrests and there are so

11

many more arrests every year.

12

And

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you say that, not

13

on-the-spot, and you also say here they're

14

suing a person who is not a policeman.

15

they have to show the causal connection.

And so

16

So the causal connection is, as again,

17

as Justice Ginsburg said, and I said in Reichle

18

is -- is significant.

It matters.

19

MR. WALL:

No, I -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, therefore, since

21

you have to show the causal connection between

22

this decision and the other person who is the

23

policeman, it doesn't really affect the police.

24
25

MR. WALL:

Oh, Justice Breyer, if the

Court designs a rule in such a way that it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

recognizes this is the one-in-a-thousand, and

2

it wants to pick up that one, though not the

3

others, that's not what the Court did in

4

Hartman, but I suppose it could do it here.

5

I think the easier way to analyze it

6

is to say, look -- and Petitioner doesn't

7

dispute that this is the basic question at page

8

9 of their reply.

9

arrest more like claims of retaliatory

Are claims of retaliatory

10

prosecution under Hartman or more like claims

11

of retaliation by employees and government

12

contractors under Mt. Healthy?

13

And I think what you'd say is:

Look,

14

arrest and prosecution are closely related

15

steps in the criminal process.

16

the same body of valuable probable cause

17

evidence.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

MR. WALL:

21

They involve

But one reason they -­

They both got a very hard

-JUSTICE KAGAN:

One reason they are

22

different is because, in Hartman, you had an

23

indictment and you just looked at the

indictment and said:

25

for that or not?

Is there probable cause

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

I mean, here we have this ridiculous

2

spectacle of going through the statute books

3

for a month, trying to find something that this

4

man may have violated.

5

be a big difference between those two

6

inquiries.

7

MR. WALL:

And there's just got to

Look, I completely agree.

8

Again, it's difficult and -- and we -­

9

Petitioner hasn't challenge -- challenged

10

Devenpeck here, so we haven't had the

11

opportunity to brief it and -- and we would

12

very much like to do so, because I -- I -- I

13

think it's too easy to just say discard the

14

Devenpeck rule.

15

Because what the court said in

Devenpeck is:

of a course of conduct.

exactly which provision of the criminal code

applied the Devenpeck rule are exactly why the

18

common law, I think on the best reading, had

19

the Devenpeck rule too.

20

common law didn't know about speech.

21

restatement recognized it.

22

over for speeding, even though that you think

23

it's because you've complained about the

24

department.

25

And it wasn't like the
The

You may be pulled

The common law took all of these

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

things into account too.

2

don't think it created an epidemic that

3

requires a drastic cure that searches for the

4

needle in the haystack.

5

And in its wisdom, I

This is the rule in the majority of

6

circuits.

7

in a lot of these cases, it's not as if

8

Petitioner and his amici have come in saying

9

there is some huge problem in the Second,

10
11

And what's notable is that, unlike

Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Eleventh circuits.
They really have sort of pointed to

12

the facts of their case, and I agree it's

13

troubling, but in the real world, I think the

14

far more serious danger is subjecting police

15

departments across the country to claims that

16

are easy to allege and difficult to disprove.

17

And weighing virtually that exact same

18

balance in Hartman, what the Court said is the

19

game is not worth the candle.

20

to try to design the constitutional tort for

21

the one-in-a-thousand case.

22

remedies that get at that.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We're not going

There are other

Mr. Wall, you keep on

24

saying one-in-a-thousand, but might there not

25

be a problem that now that we have this case

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

and we have to decide this case, and if we

2

decide it your way, you know, maybe it's a

3

green light to everybody to make it not the

4

one-in-a-thousand case and to start really

5

going -- you know, there are lots of small

6

towns in America and there are lots of cranks

7

in those small towns, and there are lots of

8

relationships that go sour between officials

9

and some members of the populace.

10

And, you know, what about that?

What

11

about, you know, finding that guy every time he

12

doesn't quite stop when he makes a right on red

13

and putting him in jail for a while?

14

MR. WALL:

So a couple of things.

15

One, again, I -- I don't think we ought to

16

believe that the only bulwark against

17

backsliding on the First Amendment is damages

18

suits, but more importantly, what I'd say is if

19

that's the kind of rule they want you to put in

20

place, they ought to have to show that the

21

common law, which had this rule for hundreds of

22

years, was a problem.

23

They ought to have to show you that

24

Hartman has created an epidemic of retaliatory

25

prosecutions.

They ought to at least have to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

show there are more retaliatory arrests in the

2

Second, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Eleventh

3

Circuits than the Ninth and Tenth, and they

4

haven't tried to do it, because what they'll

5

find, I -- I -- if you look through those cases

6

is there are a lot of claims in those circuits,

7

but they don't turn out to have a lot of merit.

8

They're difficult to defend against.

9

that's why we think the rule makes sense.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Thank you,

Four minutes, Ms. Karlan.

13

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MS. KARLAN:

Thank you.

I'd just like

16

to begin with the common law and ask this Court

17

to read its own decision in Dinsman, which is

18

the only decision by this Court talking about

19

probable cause and false arrest that antedates

20

the passage of Section 1983.

21

And here's what the Court says on page

22

402:

"Probable cause or not is of no further

23

importance than as evidence to be weighed by

24

the jury in connection with all the other

25

evidence."

That's the rule we're asking for.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

We're asking for the common law rule here.

2

And if you look at Prosser on Torts,

3

he says, people keep getting mistaken between

4

malicious prosecution, which has always had a

5

no probable cause requirement, and false

6

imprisonment, of which false arrest is a

7

subset, which has never had that requirement at

8

common law as part of the Plaintiff's

9

case-in-chief.

10

The second point I'd like to make is a

11

point that goes back to the Devenpeck issue,

12

which, as Justice Gorsuch pointed out, might be

13

perfectly sensible in the Fourth Amendment

14

context but not when you're talking about First

15

Amendment values, because First Amendment

16

values are -- the core of the First Amendment

17

is an anti-retaliation principle, and do not be

18

-- do not be fooled.

19

If you tell city councils that if they

20

deny somebody a permit they can be sued for

21

damages.

22

they can be sued for damages.

23

give him a zoning variance, they can be sued

24

for damages.

25

permit, they can be sued for damages.

If they fire him a -- from his job,
If they don't

If they don't give him a parade

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

But if they arrest him and they can

2

come up with anything, even eight years after

3

the fact, that might be something for which

4

there's probable cause, not even a showing that

5

he actually committed the offense of -- of

6

disrupting a religious assembly or assembly for

7

other purposes, but just that an officer could

8

believe probable cause, you are giving a green

9

light to every vengeful city council in America

10

to go after people when they demonstrate

11

against abortion clinics, when they demonstrate

12

about police, when they protest zoning

13

decisions.

14

The First Amendment really requires

15

that there be some remedy.

16

Section 1983 gives that remedy.

17

somebody "subjects or causes to be subjected"

18

to a violation.

19

clear that Section 1983 contemplates cases like

20

this one in which a city council caused someone

21

to be arrested.

22

And the text of
It says when

And that -- that makes it

All we ask is that this Court hold

23

that probable cause is not an absolute bar in

24

cases where retaliate -- retaliation is proven.

25
