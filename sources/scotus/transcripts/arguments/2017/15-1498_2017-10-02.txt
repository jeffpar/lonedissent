ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit erred in holding

12

that this Court's decision in Johnson compelled

13

the conclusion that the definition of crime of

14

violence in the INA's broader definition of

15

aggravated felony is unconstitutionally vague.

16

That is so for two reasons.

First,

17

the standard for assessing vagueness in the

18

immigration context is not the one that's

19

applicable in criminal cases.

20

Immigration removal is not a

21

punishment for past conduct.

It operates

22

prospectively on the basis of the application

23

of standards adopted by Congress under which an

24

alien is regarded as no longer conducive to the

25

safety and welfare.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Mr. Kneedler, if

2

you're -- if you're making the distinction that

3

Johnson was a criminal case and this is a civil

4

case, this Court has had a number of decisions

5

saying that line is not so rigid.

6

MLB, taking away parental rights, is a civil

7

proceeding.

8

criminal proceeding, for an indigent party, the

9

state must give the transcript free.

For example,

And yet the Court said, as in a

And so, if

10

you had followed a rigid criminal/civil, then

11

if it's civil, no free transcript.

12

it's criminal.

13

Only if

But the Court said the -- the line is

14

blurred when there is such a grave consequence.

15

It was a grave consequence to be denied parental

16

rights.

17

from the United States.

18

It's a grave consequence to be removed

MR. KNEEDLER:

And so our submission

19

is not just the distinction between civil and

20

criminal, although we think this Court's cases

21

establish that there is -- that there is a

22

difference.

23

though, are immigration is distinctive.

But the important points here,

24

Immigration, this Court has repeatedly

25

said, even though it may be regarded as a harsh

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

5
1

result or -- or can have a serious impact on a

2

person's life, it is not punishment for a past

3

offense.

4

Congress has determined that the individual's

5

presence in the United States is no longer

6

conducive to the safety or welfare of the

7

country.

8
9

It operates prospectively because

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Kneedler, does

that permit arbitrary removal?

Can the

10

immigration officials walk down the street and

11

say I just don't like the way you look; out?

12
13
14

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

And -- and this

brings me to -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -- but let me

15

get to that.

16

criminal or civil, the issue for us, as I

17

understand it under Johnson, is, is it

18

arbitrary?

19

standard, criminal or civil, this is vague?

20

Now, I know you're saying it's not

21

arbitrary for a bunch of different reasons.

22

But please explain to me on the two grounds

23

that Johnson used, ordinary case and type of

24

risk, how this is not equally arbitrary.

25

So whether the distinction is

Is it so arbitrary that under any

MR. KNEEDLER:

There are a number of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

6
1

-- a number of reasons why we -- why we think

2

that's true.

3

Johnson it was the sum of the various

4

attributes of the ACCA residual clause that

5

created the problem.

First of all, the Court said in

6

So whatever -- whatever might be the

7

problem with -- with one of those, it was the

8

combination of those.

9

And those -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

was only two.

11

were -­

12

Well, I thought it

The other things it mentioned

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, but, they -- they

13

were -- they were critical attributes of the

14

two.

15

That's the -- that's the important point.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean -- I mean, what

16

the Court said is -- I'm quoting -- "two

17

features of the residual clause conspire to make

18

it unconstitutionally vague."

19

you know, a clear holding sentence just a

20

little bit later on in the opinion where it

21

basically tells you exactly what two aspects

22

it's talking about.

23

indeterminacy about how to measure the risk

24

posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how

25

much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as

And then there's,

It says, "by combining

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

7
1

a violent felony.

2

more unpredictability and arbitrariness than

3

the Due Process Clause authorized tolerates."

4

The residual clause produces

So, you know, it says, Number 1,

5

ordinary case analysis.

6

with a fairly fuzzy standard as to the

7

threshold level of risk.

8

two factors.

9

Number 2, combined

And those were the

And I guess the question is, are those

10

two factors any different here?

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

Yes, they're -- they're

very different here.

13

And as this Court's decision in Leocal

14

demonstrates, it relied on the -- on the

15

features that we believe are -- critically

16

distinguished 16(b) from the ACCA residual

17

clause.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Here it's the fact

19

that there's ordinary case analysis, both

20

statutes, right?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, but they -- but

22

they operate in very different -- in very

23

different ways.

24

of saying that the elements don't have to match

25

up like under 16(a).

The -- ordinary cases is a way

It doesn't have to be the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

8
1

actual use of force.

2

situations in which the elements of the offense

3

involve a substantial risk that physical force

4

would be used even though it's not actually an

5

element.

6

16(b) addresses those

So whereas under the ACCA residual

7

clause, the ordinary case analysis was not -­

8

was not tied to the text of the -- of the

9

relevant provision as it is here.

There are

10

three provisions in the -- in the ordinary case

11

analysis that are here that weren't present

12

there.

13

You look to the nature of the offense,

14

the offense by its nature.

And this Court said

15

in Leocal that means you look at the elements

16

and the nature of the offense, involve a

17

serious or substantial risk that physical force

18

will be used, not that injury might result down

19

the road but physical force, which this Court

20

said is a -- is a focused inquiry and

21

specifically distinguished the possibility that

22

harm might result.

23

Court's opinion, it specifically distinguished

24

sentencing guideline that uses the very

25

language of the ACCA residual clause and said

And in footnote 7 of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

9
1
2

this is not open-ended like that.
And then the -- 16(b) says the

3

substantial risk has to arise in the course of

4

the commission of the offense, which means it's

5

tied both temporally to the -- to the actual

6

conduct of the offense and functionally, does

7

the substantial risk inhere in the elements of

8

the offense.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how do those

10

two things change the definition of what an

11

ordinary case is in burglary?

12

that I understand that burglars actually go

13

into an occupied home is very little.

14

probably less than 10 percent in which they

15

confront someone, probably smaller amount when

16

they actually use force against that person.

17

Lots of burglaries are done with open doors or

18

with jimmying without injuring a lock.

19

The only time

It's

How does any of those two things

20

you've mentioned -- how do they change what

21

constitutes an ordinary case for burglary and

22

what the substantial risk of use of physical

23

force or injury is?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, again, I think

starting with the text of 16(b), you look at

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

10
1

the nature of the offense, the elements of the

2

offense.

3

elements a risk, a substantial risk that force

4

will be used?

Do they -- is inherent in those

5

And -- and so looking at burglary, what

6

is the nature of the offense with respect to the

7

risk of harm -- or the, excuse me, the risk of

8

the use of force?

9

Well, this Court said in Leocal that

10

the -- the nature of the offense there is that

11

the burglar will encounter someone.

12

risk of force against a person, that the -­

13

that the offender will encounter someone while

14

committing the offense -­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If it's

Justice Scalia did

16

exactly that in Johnson and said the ordinary

17

case and the risk of force or injury is

18

something that you're leaving to the judge's

19

intuition.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I mean, with

21

respect, Justice Scalia's opinion in -- in

22

Johnson or -- or in James, or whatever case you

23

may be speaking of, was not about 16(b), and -­

24

and a unanimous decision of this Court written

25

by Chief Justice Rehnquist identified burglary

Heritage Reporting Corporation

11
1

as the classic example of what is covered by 16

2

--

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it wasn't

4

part of the residual clause anyway.

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

6

-- may I ask you just a couple quick questions?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

Mr. Kneedler, may I

Sure.
I hope they're

quick.

10

First, getting back to the standard of

11

review and the distinction between criminal and

12

civil, this Court seems to have drawn that line

13

based on the severity of the consequences that

14

follow to the individual, but that seems to me

15

a tough line here to draw because I can easily

16

imagine a misdemeanant who may be convicted of

17

a crime for which the sentence is six months in

18

jail or a $100 fine, and he wouldn't trade

19

places in the world for someone who is

20

deported -- deported from this country pursuant

21

to a civil order or perhaps the subject of a

22

civil forfeiture requirement and loses his

23

home.

24
25

So how sound is that line that we've
drawn in the past, especially when the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

12
1

civil/criminal divide itself is now a

2

seven-part balancing test, not exclusive, so

3

there may be more than seven factors as I

4

understand it.

5

And I look at the text of the

6

Constitution, always a good place to start, and

7

the Due Process Clause speaks of the loss of

8

life, liberty, or property.

9

civil/criminal line, and yet, elsewhere, even

It doesn't draw a

10

in the Fifth Amendment, I do see that line

11

drawn, the right to self-incrimination, for

12

example.

13

So help me out with that.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- the -- I

15

think the analysis derives from the thinking

16

about what the purpose of vagueness

17

restrictions are, and as this Court has said in

18

the criminal context, there are two basic

19

points.

20

One is that an individual, a person of

21

common intelligence should know, have notice of

22

what the law requires -­

23
24
25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Fair -- fair notice

of the law.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

13
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And isn't it really

2

important in the civil context, too, when we

3

have so many civil laws today, and they're

4

often hidden away in places like the Federal

5

Register and other -- other fine reads like

6

that?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, and the second

8

point I was going to mention is, is whether it

9

gives rise to the potential for arbitrary

10

enforcement.

11

immigration, for example, from -- from the

12

criminal law, for example, the notice -­

13

And what's different about

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But you'd agree the

14

fair notice point pertains to both the civil

15

and the criminal sides?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

It does, but I think in

17

-- in -- in different respects, and in some

18

ways, the two points I just mentioned -- or the

19

two points the Court has emphasized are -- are

20

related in -- in some ways.

21

But with respect to the notice point

22

the immigration context, this Court has held

23

that the ex post facto clause, which is

24

applicable in criminal proceedings, does not

25

apply in immigration proceedings.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

14
1

And, therefore, a person may be

2

removed from the United States on a ground that

3

was not a ground for removal at the time he

4

engaged in the particular conduct.

5

So the -- the idea that the -- that

6

the statute for that reason has to have a

7

notice element does not work.

8

is the concern about arbitrary enforcement.

9

And then there

This is not, by the way, the sort of

10

statute that regulates loitering or being

11

annoying on the streets or something which is

12

at the height of where I think the Court's

13

concern has been about police and juries and

14

judges being arbitrary in the application.

15

The immigration laws have always been

16

enforced through a broad delegation of

17

authority to the executive branch, reflecting

18

the fact that immigration and immigration

19

enforcement are closely related to the national

20

security and foreign relations of the United

21

States.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kneedler, does

23

the government have another string in its bow

24

here?

25

resemblance to ACCA, but you can be removed if

I know we're arguing about 16(b) and its

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

15
1

you commit a crime of moral turpitude, and

2

wouldn't burglary fall under that?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it -- it would

4

depend on the -- the rules for what is a crime

5

involving moral turpitude are somewhat

6

intricate, depending on the nature of the

7

offense.

8
9
10
11

It's not -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, hasn't it

been determined whether burglary is a crime of
moral turpitude?
MR. KNEEDLER:

But it -- again, it

12

would depend on the nature of the offense.

13

this particular case, the immigration judge

14

concluded that the conduct here involved a

15

crime involving moral turpitude, but the IJ did

16

not apply the categorical approach.

17

a fact-specific approach and concluded that the

18

defendant's conduct in this case amounted to a

19

crime involving moral turpitude.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

It applied

You think the concept

21

of a crime of moral turpitude is less vague

22

than 16(b)?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

In

No, I -- I -- I think

24

not, but -- but this -- this, I think, brings -­

25

brings to mind what's important about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

16
1

immigration enforcement or, frankly, a lot of

2

civil enforcement -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But Kneedler -­

4

Mr. Kneedler, the crime of moral turpitude is

5

always applied to the facts of the case.

6

Johnson pointed out that, when you have a

7

statute that uses approximations like

8

substantial or significant or severe, that what

9

gives it life is its application to actual

10
11

So

facts.
The difference between these two

12

approaches is that this one is asking judges to

13

hypothesize the facts and has nothing to do

14

with the reality of the crime.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, no, with respect,

16

a crime involving moral turpitude, the

17

categorical approach is applied there.

18

not -- it is not a fact-specific determination.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It is

But it is a different

20

kind of categorical approach, isn't it?

21

asking what the elements of the offense are

22

that everybody has to commit, as opposed to

23

what the elements of the offense are that

24

people commit in the ordinary case, whatever

25

that might be.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It's

Official

17
1

And that raises the question that

2

Justice Scalia thought was so important in

3

Johnson and elsewhere, where he says that

4

there's no way really for a Court to do that,

5

you know, this is the -- the line, should we

6

look to a statistical analysis of the state

7

report or a survey, expert evidence, Google,

8

gut instinct, that this is the problem with

9

ACCA's residual clause under Johnson as it is

10

here, is that we don't really have a source of

11

law to look to to tell what an ordinary case is

12

in -- under either statute.

13
14
15

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I -- I -- I really

don't think that's correct.
In Johnson, again, the Court was

16

concerned about a statute that referred to the

17

chance -- the chance that injury will occur

18

which could be completely open-ended.

19

Here, this is tied to the text of the

20

statute, by its nature, does it give rise to

21

the risk of force or -­

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mister -­
Before you get into

24

that question, before you get into does it do

25

this in terms of force, or does it do that in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

18
1

terms of injury, before you do any of that, you

2

have to have an understanding of what the

3

ordinary case is.

4

And the problem in Johnson with ACCA's

5

residual clause, according to Justice Scalia

6

and the Court, was that there was no way to

7

tell what that ordinary case was.

8
9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Again, with respect,

this Court, in Leocal, unanimously held that

10

burglary is a classic example, and it gave the

11

reason why, which I think is helpful for

12

answering this question more generally.

13

And the Court said that -- that

14

burglary, by its nature, in the course of

15

commission -- committing the offense, gives

16

rise to a risk that physical force would be

17

used during the offense because the person will

18

encounter someone else.

19

So built in inherent in the nature of

20

burglary is the risk that the burglar will

21

encounter someone while the crime is being

22

committed.

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, Mr. -- Mr.

24

Kneedler, if I might interrupt, I'm sorry, but

25

this raises a question for me about the nature

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

19
1

of our task here.

2

It seems to me that one function

3

of -- of our void-for-vagueness doctrine is not

4

just to ensure fair notice, procedural due

5

process -- I think you'd agree with that.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

Yes, but the notice -­
Yes.

Yeah.

With the caveat about

immigration, we're -- right.

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Of course not -- of

11

course not in this case, right, but, generally,

12

the doctrine serves that function.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And it also serves a

15

separation of powers function.

16

runs out and judges cannot say what the law

17

is, they don't make it up.

18

And we stop.

When the law

Right?

That's why we don't have

19

a federal common law of crime, for example,

20

right?

21

determining what the ordinary case is, the

22

ordinary course of burglary in California, does

23

it include fraudulently selling securities in

24

someone's home, that's burglary in California,

25

is that the ordinary case or not?

And I wonder here how I would go about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

20
1

I would probably want to have

2

statistics and evidentiary hearings and hear

3

experts on that question.

4

me a lot like what a legislative committee

5

might do.

6

from a legislative committee's work, am I not

7

verging on the separation of powers problem?

8
9

And that sounds to

And if I can't distinguish my job

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, at the margins or

-- or at the outer limits, there may be

10

problems like that.

11

for the Court to focus on the core of what -­

12

this -- this, unlike the ACCA residual clause,

13

has a core, what the Court -- another point we

14

haven't discussed, what the Court was concerned

15

about -­

16
17
18
19

But I think it's important

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but could you

answer my question?
MR. KNEEDLER:

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

4

generic burglary, but -- but generic burglary,

5

as this Court again unanimously held in -- in -­

6

in Leocal, is a classic example.

7

And if I could use a couple of others,

8

just to show that the Court is not at sea here,

kidnapping is another one.

Kidnapping may be

10

accomplished -- it's typically accomplished

11

maybe by the use of force, but can also be

12

accomplished by trick.

13

But that -- that doesn't mean that

14

it's not covered by 16(b) because the entire

15

time that the victim is being confined, whether

16

or not he or she knows it initially that she's

So you would have me

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I'm not -­
Look, I'm just trying

No, no, I'm not saying

18

where there are statistics available, for

20

this Court's cases under the ACCA residual

clause, that statistics were looked to to really

22

reinforce common sense.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

But do you

24

remember -- probably you do or maybe not, that

25

several judges, I remember because one of them

Heritage Reporting Corporation

was me -- and some of the lower court judges

2

said, why doesn't the sentencing commission or

why doesn't that part of the Justice Department

out what is the typical way in which, for the

6

ACCA provision, you know, the other provision,

7

they're committed, and case after case went by,

and nobody ever had the statistics.

can't get them.

Otherwise, they would.

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yeah, no, but -- but -­

13

but I think it's important to recognize that

14

what we have here is a legislative enactment in

15

which Congress chose to identify the crimes that

16

are covered by categories, the type of offense.

17

And there -- and there is only so much

18

that one can expect from a legislature in

19

identifying a category.

20

identified a category in 16(b) that is very

21

closely tied to 16(a).

22

And here, Congress

16(a) involves the situations where

23

the element -- the element of the offense

24

itself involves the use or threatened use of

25

force.

16(b) expands that slightly to say,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

okay, it may not be technically an element, but

2

is the -- is the offense under 16(b) so

3

instinct or inherent -- inherently contained, a

risk of the use of force, that it -- that it

should fall -- should fall in Congress's

judgment in that same category?

process, and they are legitimate on that score.

2

Others suggest that it really is an

element -- a form of procedural due process and

we've discussed, to keep judges out of making

asking you now.

does -- it does -­

Because the

to do it in a way that provides fair notice and

that doesn't involve this body in law making.

substantive limitation.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, it -- it could,

crimes that it believed gave rise to a

substantial risk, and we shouldn't expect the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ, ESQ.,

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16
17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

18

Let me begin -- begin with Justice

19

Gorsuch's central point.

20

right.

21

appropriately delegate to the courts and to

22

enforcement officials on the ground.

23

Justice Gorsuch is

This is not a job that Congress can

Congress has written a statute that

24

makes it impossible for ordinary citizens or

25

for law enforcement or for immigration

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

32
1

officials to figure out what the law is, and

2

Congress has delegated that function to them.

3

It has done it with two features that

4

this Court described as dooming the ACCA

5

residual clause.

6

First, the piece that most concerned

7

the Court, the Court said was most important,

8

hypothesizing this ordinary case of a crime

9

and, second, then estimating the risk

10

associated with that hypothesized version and

11

whether that meets some vague standard.

12

The government warned the Court in

13

Johnson that section 16(b) was "equally

14

susceptible to challenge."

15

right then, and the differences in statutory

16

language that the government has since

17

discovered do not change the outcome.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The government was

Well, since

19

discovered, but the statute here says "during

20

the course of committing the offense."

21

that's quite different from the statute in

22

Johnson.

23

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And

Your Honor, it isn't

24

quite different from the statute in Johnson.

25

The statute in Johnson has the same limitation

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

33
1

in different language.

Section 16(b) covers

2

risks in the course of committing the crime,

3

ACCA's residual clause covered "a crime that

4

otherwise involves conduct."

5

Both are referring back to the crime.

6

But it really -- I -- I -- I'd like to address

7

more concretely this "in the course of

8

committing the crime" point because I can't

9

tell you why the government is wrong without

10

knowing what the government thinks those words

11

mean.

12

And the government keeps shifting back

13

and forth between two versions of what "in the

14

course of committing the crime" means.

15

points, the government says that it means in

16

order to satisfy the elements of the crime.

At

17

So it reads the sentence to mean you

18

look for substantial risk that physical force

19

may be used in order to satisfy the elements,

20

but that's not how any Court was ever applying

21

this provision.

22

was telling the courts to apply this provision.

23

The government back then and even now,

It's not how the government

24

Mr. Kneedler points to conspiracy and other

25

inchoate offenses, those offenses are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

completed.

2

say, I want you to kill my wife, here is 100

3

bucks, they are completed with the utterance of

4

those words.

5

The elements are completed when you

Nevertheless, you look after the

6

utterance, at least the government urged the

7

courts.

burglary -- Johnson itself points out burglary

But what about attempted burglary in
As Johnson itself points out, or

10

was a problem.

11

the ordinary case approach, courts were

12

required to look past the elements.

13

is committed, the elements are completed the

14

moment you cross the threshold.

15

Why?

Precisely because, under

Burglary

That's -- if that's the government's

16

reading, then burglary would be out.

17

court said in Johnson is that it's what

18

happens after you cross the threshold that

19

creates the risk.

20

What the

But that's -- so -- so then the

21

government shifts to, okay, but no, no, it's

22

while the crime is under way, that's what "in

23

the course of committing the crime" means, but

24

that's not a solution.

25

problem that Johnson describes.

That is exactly the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

35
1

Its concern was that the ordinary case

2

analysis was "detached from the statutory

3

elements."

4

speculate about what happens after the

5

statutory elements have all been satisfied, but

6

while the crime is under way.

7
8

And that -- that it leads courts to

That's just as imaginary.

Now

let's -- let's look at -­

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose, Mr.

10

Rosenkranz, suppose a state enacted a statute

11

that says that no person may be licensed to

12

teach preschool, if the person has satisfied

13

the language, not by reference to 16(b), but

14

the language that's included in -- in 16(b).

15
16
17

Would that be unconstitutionally
vague?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, I -- I don't

18

think it would be.

If it's some state that is

19

not incorporating by reference Congress's

20

handiwork or saying, we're adopting this

21

language because this is language Congress

22

adopted, it wouldn't be, but -- and I see we're

23

shifting now to the other piece of the case,

24

which is whether -- which is the application of

25

criminal standards -- for civil -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

36
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, before I

2

decide -- before I can determine whether this

3

is unconstitutionally vague, I have to know

4

what the standard is, so that's my question.

5

If we apply the standard that -- that

6

generally applies to civil statutes, would this

7

be unconstitutionally vague?

8
9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

The standard that

applies -­

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, we might do -­

11

we might do a wonderful job of pruning the

12

United States Code if we said that every civil

13

statute that is not written with the specificity

14

that is required by criminal statute is

15

unconstitutionally vague, we could boil that

16

down a lot, but that's what I'm asking.

17

what you're arguing?

18

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, not at all, Your

19

Honor.

statute here that is very different from

Is that

First, you're talking about a civil

It's a licensing -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

I'm taking it

step-by-step.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:
licensing statute.

It -- right.

It's a

So there are three things

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

37
1

to say about how this criminal standard applies

2

in the civil context.

3

The first is to the premise of Your

4

Honor's question, Jordan settles the

5

question -- the answer to the question how you

6

apply criminal to the deportation context, but

7

this Court never has to decide whether to

8

reaffirm Jordan -­

9
10
11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Let's -- let's say

we don't think Jordan decided that issue.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes.

So -- so two

12

things to say before you even address Jordan,

13

and then the third thing to say is that Jordan

14

was right.

15

So the first two things, apropos of

16

Justice Alito's embedded assumption, Section

17

16(b) is a criminal statute that Congress

18

elected to import wholesale into this statute.

19

This Court has held that, if Congress

20

does that, it must -- then courts must apply

21

the same criminal vagueness standards to the

22

statute -­

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

That seems like -­
Well, that's just a

minor point that gets off the basic point of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

38
1

Justice Alito, but it did not incorporate

2

exactly this statute.

3

different.

4
5

Your Honor, no, no, I

-JUSTICE KENNEDY:

A question is

pending.

8
9

But we'll leave that.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

6
7

The language is

MR. ROSENKRANZ:
Kennedy.

I'm sorry, Justice

Congress literally said, in the INA,

10

that the crime of the -- that the definition of

11

crime of violence is the definition of Section

12

16(b), Section 16(b) being a criminal statute.

13

It then added all sorts of bells and

14

whistles of other ways to create an aggravated

15

felony, but this Court, in A.B. Small, said,

16

Here is what you do when you have a statute

17

that has both criminal and civil

18

applications -­

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I took us

20

-- I took us away from Justice Alito's inquiry.

21

He -- he wants to know the standard for

22

determining vagueness in civil cases.

23

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So the standard for

24

determining vagueness in civil cases was laid

25

out by this Court in Hoffman Estates, and the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

39
1

answer is it depends on how serious the crime

2

is.

3

The -- the seriousness of the crime -­

4

excuse me, how serious the penalty is or how

5

serious the consequence is.

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And -­
Exactly.

And that's

7

where I get stuck, right, because the

8

consequences in many civil matters can be very

9

grave, more so even than a lot of criminal

10

penalties.

11

home, his entire livelihood, deport him.

12

Civil forfeiture, take a man's

And I can think of lots of other

13

examples that can be graver than any misdemeanor

14

offense on the books today.

15

between civil and criminal depends upon a

16

seven-part non-exclusive factor balancing test.

17

So what am I supposed to do with that?

18
19

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And again, the line

Well, Your Honor, I

will answer the question, but let me preface it.

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21

(Laughter).

22

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Great.

Let me just preface it

23

by saying I've only mentioned one of the reasons

24

that this Court doesn't have to figure out the

25

answer to that question.

And let me just -­

2

3

go on.

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

5

back to your point, Justice Gorsuch, that this

6

Court has repeatedly rejected a sharp line

7

between civil and criminal.

The correct distinction is the one
that this Court identified in Hoffman Estates,

10

cases, whether civil or criminal, with severe

11

consequences -­

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

How do I determine

that?

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes.

So here is how

15

you determine it.

16

this Court has never had to answer that

17

question since Hoffman Estates set this out, so

18

it's not a question that arises very often.

19

One thing -- and by the way,

The way the Court answers the question

20

here is -- is we know that criminal cases and

21

First Amendment cases are on one side of the

22

line.

23

What else comes on that side of

24

the line?

If ever there was a consequence that

25

was on a par with criminal cases, it is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

41
1

banishment, exile, lifetime banishment, the

2

Framers understood banishment to be equivalent

3

to taking away that which makes life worth

living, Madison talked about banishment as the

5

quintessential penalty, he says it's difficult

6

to imagine a doom to which the name cannot be

7

applied.

8

Court.

9

example.

10

By the way, this is not new to this
It's not just Justice Ginsburg's

In a case involving a criminal

11

protection, that is a constitutional protection

12

that -- that relates only to crimes, that is

13

Padilla and the -- the Sixth Amendment,

14

deportation already stands alone as the only

15

civil consequence that triggers a

16

constitutional protection on a par with the

17

criminal protection.

18

So you don't get to come into court

19

and say my lawyer didn't get -- didn't tell me

20

that I could forfeit my home.

21
22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

don't want to answer the question.

23

(Laughter.)

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

I get that you

But I'm really -­

I'm very interested in the answer, which is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

42
1

Justice Gorsuch is -- is asking how

2

you -- where do you draw the line?

3

acceptable civil vagueness and non-acceptable

4

civil vagueness?

5

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7
8
9

So

Well, Your Honor -­
Or vagueness

generally.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:
that it varies.

Hoffman Estates says

So what we're talking about is

10

the line between the severest penalties and

11

those penalties that are less severe.

12

The answer is, if it is on a par with

13

a criminal punishment such that someone would

14

trade one for the other, this Court answered

15

that question in Lee.

16

In Lee, this Court said, as Justice

17

Gorsuch said earlier today, most people would

18

happily take a little bit extra time in prison

19

in order to avoid the consequence of

20

deportation.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor, but

2

-- but not as severe as lifetime banishment

3

from this country, which is preceded by

4

automatic and mandatory imprisonment.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

And when we start -­

6

aren't we going to get into this same kind of

7

legislating and how -- how severe?

8

this line drawn?

9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Where is

Well, Your Honor,

10

this is the line this Court drew in Hoffman

11

Estates.

12
13

I mean, that was decades ago.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

about this line?

Life, liberty, or property.

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

16

What do you think

That's a great line.
It's right out of

the text of the Due Process Clause itself.

17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, that's a great

18

line:

19

particularly here we are talking about a liberty

20

interest, a liberty interest that says you must

21

leave, for some people, the only home that

22

you've ever -- that you've ever had.

23

leave your family.

24
25

Life, liberty, or property.

And -- and

You must

JUSTICE BREYER:

You think you could

go back to Justice Kennedy's original question?
If you don't recall it -­

11

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I do.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- what sticks in my

13

mind, if I get it right, is let's look at the

14

old ACCA -- the one we struck down in Johnson,

15

and the difficult language was it involves

16

conduct that presents a serious potential risk

17

of physical injury to another.

18

were a lot of examples where, gee, it's awfully

19

tough to figure out whether it does or does not

20

fall within those words.

21

And then there

Now let's look at this language.

It

22

involves a substantial risk that physical force

23

against the person or property to another may

24

be used in the course of committing the

25

offense.

Now, that would seem to be that if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

45
1

the offense is conspiracy to commit burglary,

2

the conspiracy is finished, over, done with,

3

long before they get to the property.

4

And so that wouldn't be too tough.

5

But burglary, which takes place on the

6

property, or conspiracy under the first statute

7

which would lead to the burglary that takes

8

place, well, that becomes tougher.

9

Okay.

Now let's look at our statute now.

10

And give me some examples.

I'm sure there are

11

many.

12

under this language, it seems, my God, what is

13

the basic case?

But I think it would be helpful where

14

This is impossible.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I'll give you

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

First, Sykes,

15

several.

18

vehicular flight.

Okay.

How do we -- the

19

Court was -- was mired in controversy about how

20

you figure out whether vehicular flight is

21

going to give rise to the right sort of risk

22

and how do you -- how did the Court do it?

23

was looking at the moments or the long time

24

frame after the elements were satisfied.

25

moment you pull out, you are in vehicular

9

And the distinction between

Okay, next one, residential trespass.

10

It all depends upon, first, what do you imagine

11

the ordinary case to be of residential trespass

12

and then figure out how it plays out.

13

Or car burglary, same exact problem.

14

Or to take one example directly out of ACCA,

15

extortion.

16

It all depends upon the ordinary case

17

analysis, which -- which goes back to Justice

18

Sotomayor's question early on.

19

this problem is this ordinary case approach, and

20

none of the -- the statutory differences that

21

the Government has pointed to help you figure

22

out what the ordinary case is.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The heart of

And, Mr. Rosenkranz,

24

just to tie in this ordinary case problem with

25

this phrase about "during the commission of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

47
1

the crime," has the Government in all of this

2

briefing and in all of this argument ever come

3

up with a single crime in which the ordinary

4

case of that crime, the injury would be

5

occurring after the commission of the crime?

6

If the commission of the crime is taken to mean

7

not just elements but a more general view of

8

what the crime is.

9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

In this case, no.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm just suggesting

11

that the Government has never come up with a

12

single case under ACCA in which -- and,

13

remember, ACCA requires you to look at the

14

ordinary case.

15

In the ordinary case, what crime has

16

injury that occurs after the commission of the

17

crime?

The Government has not told us of any.

18

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

If you are -- that is

19

correct, after the crime is over.

20

CHIEF JUDGE ROBERTS:

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

position, contrary to what it persuaded multiple

25

I think the Government's current

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And so that's the example, but in

2

order to get there, the government has to take

3

the quintessential crime of violence and say

4

that it is not -­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that's

6

inconsistent with everything that the government

7

has said in multiple cases; isn't that correct?

8

10

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, in -- in -- I

mean, the courts of appeals that have said that
those crimes are within the residual -­

11

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

that's in, then this whole notion of in the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Rosenkranz?
Yes.
What do you say to

19

the critique that the void-for-vagueness

20

doctrine, as an originalist issue matter, is

21

just substantive due process and suspect on

22

that basis and therefore should be narrowly

23

construed?

24
25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, it's not

-- it's not substantive due process.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It's a

Official

51
1

procedural due process concern and it's a

2

separation of powers concern.

3

those.

4

It's both of

It is the procedural right on the part

5

of the individual who's being accused or being

6

deported to know what the law is in advance.

7

And as Justice Thomas has explained very

8

eloquently, it derives out of the rule of

9

lenity.

And it's also, as Your Honor was

10

pointing out, a very important separation of

11

powers set of principles because the law

12

enforcement officer on the ground who gets to

13

tell a non-LPR, you are an aggravated felon and

14

you are out, with no opportunity for BIA review

15

and very limited judicial -- opportunity for

16

judicial review, that is a classic abdication

17

of congressional authority to line level

18

officers.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

How is it -- how is it

20

procedural?

21

it's a procedural right.

22

the statute is void for vagueness.

23

certainly is substantive.

24
25

I don't understand how you can say

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

You said -- you said
That

Your Honor, you say

the statute is void for vagueness because when

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

52
1

it is being applied to an individual, that

2

individual is given no notice that lifetime

3

banishment is going to be the consequence of

4

what he thought to be a safe harbor -­

5
6

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what if he was

given notice in some other way?

7

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I think it depends in

8

what way.

But this Court said in Johnson -- I

9

mean, Johnson actually had notice.

Johnson

10

knew that the illegal -- that the sawed-off

11

shotgun was illegal, but this Court struck the

12

statute.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

point.

15

the procedural violation?

16

He had notice.

So that makes my
He knew.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So where's

Well, for -- for the

17

vast majority of people and the people who are

18

affected by it, it is procedural.

19

But, you know, Your Honor, I just

20

realized, in this colloquy, I never did answer

21

the other part of Your Honor's question,

22

Justice Alito, about the reasons why the

23

vagueness standard applies here, the criminal

24

vagueness standard.

25

So the first I said, before you ever

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

53
1

get to Jordan, is that the -- that 16(b) is

2

itself a criminal statute.

3

The second reason is, to the point

4

that Justice Gorsuch was making about the

5

relationship between -- between criminal law

6

and immigration law, there is not an area of

7

law where the two are as integrated, and 16(b),

8

in particular, excuse me, the ACCA provision

9

here, in particular, has very significant

10

criminal consequences.

11

The aggravated felon label, once you

12

are an aggravated felon, now that's in the INA,

13

certain immigration crimes are triggered.

14

so aggravated felon becomes a -- an element of

15

a crime.

And

16

And I'll give you an example.

17

this -- if this vagueness analysis works the way

18

the government says it works, Mr. Dimaya can be

19

deported because he had sufficient notice or the

20

statute was sufficiently clear, but an

21

aggravated felon who reenters this country is

22

prosecuted as an aggregated felon.

23

If -- if

So, if he reentered the country, he can

24

then be not -- he then -- he can then not be

25

prosecuted as an aggravated felon because the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

54
1

statute would be too vague.

2

sense, which is exactly why this Court adopted

3

the rule that it adopted in A.B. Small and that

4

four members of this Court repeated in

5

Northwestern Bell, which is, if Congress makes

6

that choice to give civil and criminal

7

ramifications to the same statute, the very

8

same statute, if the statute is void for vague

9

in one context, it's void for vague in the

10
11

That makes no

other.
And, by the way, that other context in

12

A.B. Small was a silly little contract case,

13

not, you know, even, you know, the licensing of

14

a nursery.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rosenkranz, can

16

I ask you a simple question?

17

Court has held crime of moral turpitude isn't

18

unconstitutionally vague, why should 16(b) fail

19

to meet the vagueness test?

20

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

If -- if, as this

Your Honor, the

21

answer is crime involving moral turpitude does

22

not sit in a vacuum by itself.

23

that Congress adopted that has, at this point,

24

probably two centuries' worth of law describing

25

what is in and what is out.

It is a phrase

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

55
1

And, by the way, so what did the Court

2

do in Jordan?

3

to say, You, Jordan, you committed a fraud.

4

thing that has been clear, since as long as

5

those words have been used, is that a fraud is a

6

classic crime involving moral turpitude.

7

What the Court did in Jordan was

That's why he lost that case.

One

And if

8

he had been criminally prosecuted under a

9

statute that made an element of the crime that

10

it become -- that it be a crime involving moral

11

turpitude, the same result would obtain.

12

And -- and so -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, maybe you have

14

in your head a list of -- you could categorize

15

any offense that I might mention and say that's

16

a crime of moral turpitude, that's not a crime

17

of moral turpitude.

I couldn't do that.

18

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well -­
And I doubt that

20

somebody who's facing possible removal

consequences would be able to answer that

22

question.

23

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor -­

And -- but let me -- but let

You don't have to know, but you -- you
have to be able to go to someplace like a

lawyer who can tell you what the answer is.

13

crime is categorized as in or out based upon

14

decades of -- of judicial and other

15

interpretations.

There are 14 pages

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and in a crime

17

of moral turpitude, we don't have to consider

18

what the ordinary case is, do we?

19

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I think that is what

20

the Court -- no, not the ordinary case, that is

21

for sure.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

We don't.
Yes.

That is correct.

All we do is look to

the elements that everybody has to meet.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

57
1

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Correct, correct.

So

2

let me close with this.

I -- I appreciate the

3

instinct to try and see if this Court can do

4

better with Section 16(b) than it did with

5

ACCA's residual clause, but in deciding whether

6

to take that route, this Court has to decide

7

whether anything is to be gained by this whole

8

enterprise of sending the lower courts back to

9

apply now a different standard and figure out

10

how it applies to all of these crimes, that

11

process is going to be no less arbitrary, no

12

less speculative, and lifetime banishment

13

should not hang on the unpredictable answer to

14

the question, Is this crime in or is it out?

15

Congress can, of course, decide the

16

circumstances under which lifetime residents

17

can be kicked out of this country, but it

18

disserves the separation of powers, that

19

Justice Gorsuch referred to, to allow Congress

20

to pass the buck to immigration officials and

21

courts with a provision this vague.

22

If there are no further questions, we

23

respectfully request that the Court affirm the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, there are several

7

points I would like to make.

8

with respect to conspiracy and some of the

9

other crimes that have been mentioned, this is

10
11

First of all,

a critical point to understand.
Those crimes are continuing crimes.

12

Conspiracy is -- conspiracy, you could be

13

prosecuted for conspiracy from the moment of

14

the agreement, but the conspiracy continues up

15

until the commission of the crime.

16

commission of the crime is the culmination of

17

the conspiracy.

The

It -­

Escape from a prison is a

And 16(b) and its counterpart in
924(c) serve a critical role in circumstances

Heritage Reporting Corporation

59

like that, where a crime extends over a period

2

of time, you can complete the crime without

3

violence being an element, but there's -- it

4

is instinct with risk of crime, and that is

5

why -- or, excuse me, force, and that is why

6

Congress addressed it, and that is what this

7

Court unanimously focused upon in Leocal.

8

This -- 16(b) has been on the books
for 30 years and has not generated any -­

10

anything like the sort of confusion that ACCA's

deportation?

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's not

Well, it can be -- I

23

don't know the percentage, but it's also a basis

24

for denial of discretionary relief.

25

Also in deciding what -- what falls in

this category, statistics are not the -- the

2

major thing.

3

at, the body of judicial decisions construing

4

the very provision, the background of the legal

5

traditional, which is what this Court drew on in

6

-- in Leocal, in saying that burglary is a

7

classic example, it's a classic example for the

8

reasons that I just gave.

9

There are plenty of things to look

You can look at the legislative

10

judgments embodied in the crime, is the -- is

11

the circumstance when force is not used, does

12

it -- is it like the situations where the

13

elements are -- are present?

14

You asked for an example, I think, of

15

a -- of a crime that would be in under ACCA and

16

out here.

17

possession -- inherent in the possession is not

18

the use.

19

the use of a weapon.

20

Possession of a weapon is one because

There has to be a subsequent act in

So that's -- that's out here because

21

it's not in the course of committing the crime

22

of possession.

23

because it is -- injury might flow, and it was

24

actually a pretty good illustration of the

25

difference between the two circumstances.

We said it was in, in ACCA,

And, finally, with respect to

2

immigration, I think it's important for the

3

Court to understand that immigration provisions

4

and grounds for deportation are often written

5

in very broad and general terms and given

6

content by the executive branch in which

7

Congress has -- has vested authority.

8

Crimes involving moral turpitude -­

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You're not asking

10

the executive -- for the executive to define

11

these crimes.

You're asking us to do it, right?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

immigration context -­

14

Well, in the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

This isn't an

15

example where Congress has delegated authority

16

to the executive to do this.

17
18
19

Are you asking -- are you suggesting
it's delegated to this branch to do it?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it's not delegated

20

to this branch.

This branch has to construe

21

the -- the statute that Congress has enacted.

22

In other circumstances, the agency, of course,

23

gets deference in deciding what constitutes a -­

24

a particular removable offense.
