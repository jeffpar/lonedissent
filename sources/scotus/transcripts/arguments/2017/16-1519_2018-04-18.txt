ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL L. GEYSER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. GEYSER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act

12

covers the cost of lost income and necessary

13

child care, transportation, and other expenses,

14

while participating in the investigation or

15

prosecution of the offense or attending

16

proceedings related to that offense.

17

That language does not cover the cost

18

of hiring four law firms, a consulting firm,

19

and forensic experts for a private

20

investigation in bankruptcy litigation.

21

government's theory does not fit Section

22

3663A's plain text, and it cannot explain the

23

clear and obvious differences between this

24

statute and other restitution provisions,

25

which, unlike here -- where, unlike here,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official

Congress did provide make-whole relief.

2

The government tries to make up for

3

these deficiencies by citing statements in the

4

legislative history, broad declarations of

5

Congress's purpose, and the ordinary definition

6

of restitution.

7

in the statute.

8
9

None of these appear anywhere

The government looks everywhere but
the statutory text because the language and

10

logic of the provision is directly at odds with

11

the government's reading.

case, it's not dischargeable in bankruptcy.

MR. GEYSER:

That's true.

action filed by the employer?

22

MR. GEYSER:

I think under Section 523

23

of -- of the Bankruptcy Code, it may not be

24

dischargeable.

25

It depends on the nature of the offense and -­

I think it is a close question.

we're busy with some other stuff, we'd like you

6

to go ahead and investigate it to the extent

7

you can, and they'd used the results of their

8

investigation in their prosecution?

9

MR. GEYSER:

That's still not covered,

specific enumeration of expenses, Congress here

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

If they leave

Well, what about

hiring a lawyer to be a witness in a

governmental investigation?

4

MR. GEYSER:

Would that be

We don't think it is

5

under our broader argument, Justice Gorsuch,

6

because, again, hiring a lawyer is not like

7

child care, transportation.

8

9

fees, it said so expressly, as it did in

And Congress,

Section 2259.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, maybe this is

12

the same question as Justice Gorsuch had, but

13

14

investigating agency -- say we're coming in and

15

we want statements from all of your officers

16

and we're going to be questioning all of your

17

officers; and the company then hires an

18

attorney to assist.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

theory, no, because it's not the kind of

expense that Congress had in mind.

have the alternative theory that, at least in

4

expense during the participation of the

6

government's investigation.

7

But we do

That's very different than a private

8

investigation operated entirely apart from the

9

government's investigation; indeed, one that

10

occurs before the government has even started

11

its investigation.

12

that is occurring before as an expense that's

13

happening during an investigation that hasn't

14

yet started.

15

No one thinks of an expense

Now,

previously, there was a statute called the

discretionary restitution statute, and it

allowed -- discretionary -- expenses related to

6

participation in the investigation.

7

would have said that, quite likely, Sam's

8

pre-investigation expense was related to the

Is there anything -­

since I'm interested in history, is there

14

anything in the legislative history that

15

suggests that this change of language was

16

intended to diminish the scope of the

17

restitution?

18

MR. GEYSER:

The -- I don't think

19

there's anything either way on that particular

20

point, but what there is, and I do think this

21

is important, Congress specifically raised

22

concerns about things like attorneys' fees that

23

would end up leading to protracted,

24

complicated, fact-intensive disputes that would

25

slow the efficiency of sentencing proceedings.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

This statute, because it's mandatory,

2

applies in tens of thousands of proceedings

3

every year.

4

(c)(3)(B) of the Act, Congress specifically

5

said that restitution is not authorized where

6

it would delay the sentencing proceeding.

7

And if you look at subsection

And that makes perfectly good sense

8

that Congress then would limit the expenses to

9

the kind of incidental out-of-pocket expenses

10

that are very easy to calculate.

11

Fee disputes are notoriously difficult

12

to calculate.

13

especially independently of the government,

14

they're conducting their own resource -­

15

they're conducting their own investigation,

16

hiring whoever they wish to hire, and that's

17

perfectly fine, and there might be other

18

mechanisms that Congress would have deferred to

19

in the civil venue to resolve those sorts of

20

disputes.

21

When you have people operating,

But that's very different than saying

22

in a mandatory statute that these -- that

sentencing judges, and, again, tens of

24

thousands of proceedings every year, have to go

25

through and entertain, you know, disputes about

how much was actually necessary, was it proper

2

to hire four law firms, were the expenses

3

devoted just to proving innocence and guilt or

4

were they also devoted for business reasons or

5

economic reasons.

6

Most internal investigations, as Judge

7

Kavanaugh pointed out in his opinion in

8

Papagno, they extend far beyond just

9

identifying the guilty party.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

They -­

Suppose the -- suppose

11

the statute did not refer to lost income and

12

necessary child care, transportation expenses,

13

and simply authorized restitution for "other

14

expenses incurred during participation in the

15

investigation."

16
17
18

Would you still have this -- would you
still win?
MR. GEYSER:

We -- in this case, we

19

would, Your Honor, because GE Capital's

20

expenses predated the government investigation.

21

So any expenses were not incurred during

22

participation in the government's

23

investigation.

reading a word into that text, in the

would avoid those problems because it wouldn't

8

the FBI and they incur out-of-pocket incidental

9

expenses.

expense incurred during participation in the

But there still is

Participation does not simply mean to

help or support.

That's not how people talk.

So Congress clearly -- and if you take

19

a step back and read the section holistically,

20

as the government suggests, and you should,

21

this statute lines up perfectly if what you

22

have in mind is what it naturally suggests.

who had to go and meet with the FBI agents and

25

go and testify at the criminal hearing,

everything here makes perfect sense.

incidental out-of-pocket expenses of traveling

opportunity costs of doing whatever else they'd

11

request of the FBI goes through company records

13

that, that is not participation in the

14

government's investigation?

And since we've been talking about the

investigation, I do want to make clear that

7

there are actually two pockets of expenses

8

here, and one was the pocket for the bankruptcy

litigation.

The bankruptcy litigation is

10

simply exactly like every other ordinary civil

11

litigation designed to recoup damages for a

12

crime.

13

And I don't see any way that that

14

falls within the phrase "attendance at

15

16

there are two reasons -­

I think

2

in the proceedings.

These were for participating

4

Surely, when Congress said

5

"attendance," they're -- they're thinking of

6

physical attendance.

7

because, if you read the -- the sentence in its

8

entirety, they're talking about things like

9

lost income because you're not physically at

And, again, we know that

10

your job, you're somewhere else, or they're

11

talking about child care because you're not

12

watching your child, you're at the hearing, or

13

transportation.

14

So I think it's too much to read

15

"attendance" out of the statute.

16

would make more sense if it said any losses

17

incurred during proceedings related to the

18

offense.

19

don't see any plausible reading that says

20

attendance includes the entirety of litigating

21

a case.

This is saying that we will

19

reading (b)(1) not to say "an offense resulting

20

in damage to or loss or destruction of

21

property," but an offense resulting in any

22

damage or loss.

23

It suggests that it -- it's really

It's true that property can be money,

24

25

money is property, so any offense that causes

me in some future, you know, proceeding or

2

event to spend money is then spending property,

3

and, therefore, I've lost property as a result

of the offense.

5

If you look at the actual language and

progression of (b)(1), it's quite clearly

thinking of property.

step is, if you've taken the property, you have

Money spent on things

within the -- the confines of (b)(1).

13

And under the government's view, this

14

also would read out of the statute subsections

15

(b)(2) through (b)(4), because anytime that

16

someone, say, is injured by a physical crime,

17

they have to go get healthcare; then they're

18

spending money, which is property, on the

19

healthcare, and that would be a result of the

MR. GEYSER:

Oh, Your Honor, if you

look at pages 28 and 29 of the Joint Appendix,

that, the fees that we charge because we sat in

5

MR. GEYSER:

That -- that would at

6

least satisfy the term "attendance," but I was

7

-- my second reason that -- that I didn't get

8

to is that it's still attendance, we think, at

9

criminal proceedings.

10

And I think that's

clear, again, from the context of the statute.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why isn't a

12

bankruptcy related to the criminal -- I mean,

13

it's -- it's -- it's related to the offense,

14

right?

15

So why is it related to the offense?
MR. GEYSER:

Well, I -- I think if you

16

read the statute as a whole and you look at

17

(b)(4) with all of its terms -- and this is a

18

point that Judge Higginson made below under

19

noscitur a sociis -- all the terms here are

20

talking about proceedings related to the

21

criminal action.

22

and prosecution of the offense.

23

attendance at proceedings related to the

24

offense.

25

to cover civil proceedings, and this is why.

So you have the investigation
You have

It wouldn't make -- make much sense

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

If Congress wanted to have recovery

2

for victims just for showing up at a civil

3

hearing, presumably, they would also want to

4

cover the fees for the hearing, the filing fee

5

for the case, or maybe the attorneys' fees or

6

expert fees, all the normal expenses that

7

people incur in civil proceedings.

8
9

It would be passing strange to say
that Congress thought, you know what, when the

10

victim has to show up to testify, that we'll -­

11

we'll cover, but we're not going to cover

12

anything else.

13

And it does make sense, though, if you

14

look at this as proceedings related to the

15

criminal action, when a victim has to testify

16

at a criminal proceeding, the only expenses

17

they incur are those out-of-pocket expenses.

18

The government bears everything else because

it's their case.

proceedings related to the offense, other than

the proceedings could be things like a grand

would be proceedings in the prosecution.

20

MR. GEYSER:

in the prosecution, but I think Congress there

22

was trying to make sure that any proceeding

23

related to the criminal prosecution would be

24

covered.

25

And -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, they used the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

term "prosecution" earlier in the provision.

2

If they wanted to limit it to proceedings in

3

the prosecution, why wouldn't they use the same

term again?

5

formulation, "related to the offense"?

6

Why would they use this broader

MR. GEYSER:

Well, again, Your Honor,

7

I -- I could see someone thinking there's a

8

distinction between a hearing that is

9

determining if there's sufficient evidence to

10

issue an indictment, so the prosecution hasn't

11

yet commenced, and proceedings after the

12

indictment, where it has commenced.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

So you -- maybe

you've got the grand jury proceeding, but you

15

have nothing else, right?

MR. GEYSER:

That's it?

There -- there could be,

17

depending on the offense, other types of

proceedings, but, again, I think this is

Congress trying to make sure that if a witness

MR. HUSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act

would be expected to participate.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

does happen the reverse way.

the police get information and they go to the

company.

7

MR. HUSTON:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

There are times

I -­
I think it's a

closer call on whether in that situation -- and

10

if they ask the company to look into something

11

it wasn't aware of, whether that's

12

participation.

13

Putting that aside, it doesn't

14

necessarily follow that an investigation by a

15

company always precedes the prosecution.

MR. HUSTON:

It doesn't always

precede.

18

19

typical way in which a victim -­

The typical way is

the government prosecutes -- investigates.

And I think the cases that we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34

Breyer's example -- example earlier this

2

morning illustrated, which is that it is

3

extremely common, and Congress would have

4

understood, that victims routinely play an

5

indispensable role in the investigation.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's why I don't

7

understand the statute, because you have a big

8

problem, I think, with the language of the

9

statute.

If, in fact, it's an investigation by

10

the company before the police investigation

11

begins, do they get child care?

12

care, transportation?

13

about that?

15

I mean, child

I mean, what do you do

And -- and so I'm stuck.

Now you're, of course, going to get me
out of being stuck.

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. HUSTON:

Your Honor, I think that

18

what the statute reflects, again, is the fact

19

that victims routinely incur expenses in

20

internal investigations that uncover invaluable

21

evidence of crimes.

22

most rest -- fraud cases make up a larger

23

category of restitution awards than any other

24

type of offense.

25

that in fraud cases, the way that frauds are

investigation or prosecution or proceedings

Counsel, you say

5

that the bankruptcy was a proceeding related to

6

the offense because fraud was at issue there

7

too.

8
9

And -- and maybe this is a clearer-cut
case, but there are going to be plenty where

10

the reasons for the bankruptcy are going to be

11

in dispute, and we're going to invite district

12

judges to engage in long collateral proceedings

13

over whether something is or isn't related

14

enough to the offense.

15

What do we do about that?

relatedly, you know, this statute covers a lot

of different kinds of crimes, including violent

crimes.

Section 3664(f)(1)(A), which is incorporated

20

into this statute, the MVRA, by Section

21

3663A(d).

22

Those -- that -- that provision of

23

Section 3664 is what expresses that in each

24

case of restitution, restitution is to be

25

awarded for the full amount of the victim's

losses.
Now, again, it's not the case that

3

it's the full amount, full stop.

fit into one of the categories in (b).

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You have to

All right.

I -­

But what about the

7

-- the general premise of our system that

8

expenses doesn't include attorneys' fees, that

9

people who incur attorneys' fees, that's their

10
11

expense, that doesn't get shifted away?
There is the general presumption that

12

if Congress wants attorneys' fees to be

13

awarded, it will not say something like

14

expenses; it will be specific that attorneys'

15

fees are covered.

16

MR. HUSTON:

17

points about that, Your Honor.

18

If I might make two

The first is that I don't really think

19

the American rule of attorneys' fees has much

20

bearing on this case because that's a rule

21

about structuring correct incentives in civil

22

litigation.

23

the criminal context where Petitioner is the

24

wrongdoer.

25

And that just doesn't translate to

And the second point is that the Crime

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

Victims' Rights Act, which is cited in our -­

2

in our brief at Section -- at page 14A of the

3

gray brief, makes it explicit that Congress

4

contemplated victims would have a right to the

5

assistance of counsel in order to do things

6

like participate in a crime -- a criminal

7

defendant's sentencing proceeding.

8
9

If you think, for example, about the
case of -- if my accountant calls me up and

10

says that I owe $5,000 to the IRS, but,

11

actually, I only owe $1,000 and he just pockets

12

the whole amount, when that crime is

13

discovered, I'm going to need the assistance of

14

a second accountant in order to figure out how

15

much I'm defrauded, in order to be able to do

16

things like participate in the criminal

17

defendant's sentencing proceeding, file a

18

victim impact statement, and seek restitution.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're also going to

20

get all of the child care and transportation.

21

Is that your opinion?

22

MR. HUSTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

If I

23

incurred those expenses, I would have those.

24

And I think -- but I think that actually

25

illustrates -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it seems odd

2

that this investigation could go on for quite a

3

while, and during that time, it's the company's

4

investigation, it goes on for several months,

5

child care -- child care for, I guess, anybody

6

called up, and transportation.

7

all covered?

8
9

MR. HUSTON:

That is all -­

It is, Your Honor.

But,

again, that's because of the breadth of this

10

statute.

11

And I think the -- the apparent oddity is

12

explained by the fact that Congress wanted to

13

make sure that even the stuff that wouldn't

14

readily come to your mind is covered.

15
16

It covers a great deal of crimes.

But Congress would have understood
that in fraud offenses -­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. HUSTON:

Lunches?

I think, Your Honor,

19

perhaps, yes, absolutely.

20

would, if it -- you know, if you can make the

21

case that they're proximately caused.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think that that

Mr. Huston, one of the

23

things that strikes me about the statute, and

24

it's -- it's -- it's, I think, the thing that

25

is giving you problems on several dimensions,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

is that this statute is pretty clearly written

2

with an individual victim in mind.

3

And I don't know exactly how that

4

cuts.

5

problem with the language of this statute is -­

6

is because it's thinking about individuals who

7

have necessary child care, who have lost

8

income, who participate in only a single

9

investigation, which is the government's

10
11

But everything that's giving you a

investigation, who actually attend proceedings.
You know, all these things make sense

12

when you're talking about an individual, and

13

make no sense when you're talking about a

14

corporation.

15

which way that cuts and what we're supposed to

16

do with that.

17

And I'm -- I'm just wondering

MR. HUSTON:

Well, I think I would say

18

this, Your Honor:

19

dispute that a company that's a victim of a

20

fraud, as in this case, can be a victim for

21

purposes of the MVRA.

22

It's clear -- there's no

That's acknowledged.

I think you're right that that's what

23

Congress had in mind when it wrote this

24

statute, but, again, I think that that's

25

because it would have been concerned that, you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

know, a child -- child care expenses are not

2

the sort of thing that come to your mind when

3

you think most naturally about restitution.

4

But Congress wanted to express the breadth of

5

this provision by making -­

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, if -- if

7

that's the case, if you agree that the purpose

8

here is all about individual victims, doesn't

9

that really pose a serious problem for you?

10

Because it seems that the government's effort

11

here is really to externalize the costs of its

12

own investigations in corporate -- in corporate

13

situations.

14

MR. HUSTON:

Your Honor, I -- I

15

respectfully disagree for this reason:

16

Congress would have been aware of the many,

17

many cases that illustrate the principle that

18

we -- that we discuss in our brief, which is it

19

is very common in fraud cases against

20

corporations for the fraud to be discovered

21

through an internal investigation.

22

So this is really the heartland of an

23

investigation.

24

thing that Congress would -­

I understand that.

mean to suggest that only -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. HUSTON:

Ah.

-- individual victims are

covered.

14

thinking about child care expenses, Congress

15

has individual victims in mind.

16

-- my response with -- to Justice Kagan was

meant to say that that's -- the sort of -­

those types of situations, even those less

obvious things, are what Congress would have

wanted to cover.

ahead.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We have talked

3

about two investigations:

4

and the government's investigation.

5

statute talks about participation in the

6

investigation, only one.

7

GE's investigation
The

And it seems to me if you're talking

8

about only one, it obviously has to be the

9

government's.

10

MR. HUSTON:

I respectfully disagree,

11

Your Honor, for this reason:

12

you were to describe all of GE Capital's

13

efforts in this case, the hiring of forensic

14

experts that preserved crucial evidence to the

15

prosecution, the time that they spent with

16

financial consultants unraveling Petitioner's

17

two years of fraudulent accounting practices,

18

if you went to a person on the street and

19

described everything that GE Capital did in

20

this case and then asked did GE Capital

21

participate in the investigation of this

22

offense, we think the answer would absolutely

23

be yes.

24

And that -­

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think that if

I think we wouldn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

use the word "participate," would we?

2

say GE conducted the investigation.

3

MR. HUSTON:

We would

Well, I think that the -­

4

that "participation" is a very sensible term

5

here because it reflects the fact that the

6

amount -- the victim's participation is going

7

to vary at various times.

8
9

The investigation of a crime happens
ordinarily in phases.

Sometimes it starts with

10

a state-level -- investigation.

11

starts, for example, in the SEC, in a civil

12

administrative proceeding.

13

what discovers a federal fraud, and it's passed

14

over to the government.

15

Sometimes it

And then that is

And sometimes victims are the ones who

16

conduct an internal investigation, as in

17

Justice Breyer's example about the bookkeeper,

18

that reveals the fraud, and then the victim is

19

the one that hands the investigation over.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's all true, but

21

what I'm thinking is, I look back, now this is

22

expenses related to participation.

23

to me, intuitively as a judge, excellent

24

because there are vast numbers of circumstances

25

and the trial judge will figure out what's

That seems

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

appropriate.

2

that, and instead of it being discretionary, it

3

becomes mandatory.

4

Now Congress is going to change

Well, if you're going to make

5

something mandatory, you say we better narrow

6

it and be specific.

7

explain why this is limited to the government's

8

investigation, particularly when you think of

9

hundreds of billions of dollars in restitution

And then that would

10

that is owed by people who commit crimes that

11

is not dischargeable in bankruptcy, which is

12

never collected, and throughout the rest of

13

their lives is simply there as uncollected

14

debt, really causing a problem.

15

So, if Congress was aware of all this

16

and really thought let's narrow it, well, that

17

would explain the differences.

18

for me is it doesn't say a word, does it?

19

do you have a view?

20

MR. HUSTON:

But the problem

Your Honor, we do.

So

And

21

if I could just take those two points, I think,

22

in your question, in reverse order.

23

The first is that it's -- to the

24

extent that much restitution was awarded in

25

this case and that restitution -- there are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

many unpaid restitution awards in this country,

2

that's a fact of Congress's explicit,

3

deliberate choice in Section 3664(f)(1)(A) to

4

award restitution without regard to the

5

economic circumstances of the defendant.

6

That's the one thing that everyone agrees on,

7

is that that shouldn't be taken into account.

8
9

Now we don't quibble with Your Honor's
point that it has to be incurred during the

10

investigation of the offense, but as I was

11

saying earlier, we think that the investigation

12

of a criminal offense is ordinarily understood

13

to include phases.

14

take place before the government gets involved

15

because that's -­

16

And some of those phases

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the -- if Congress

17

intended to cover an investigation conducted by

18

a company, wouldn't it -- wouldn't it use a

19

term like "reasonable," reasonable expenses

20

incurred?

21

MR. HUSTON:

Your Honor, I think that

22

the word "necessary" in this statute functions

23

in -- in a -- in -- in a similar way.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, there's a big

difference between necessary -- well, how would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

you determine whether the scope of an internal

2

investigation is necessary?

3

mean?

4

whether it was reasonable in scope.

What does that

It would make much more sense to ask

5

MR. HUSTON:

I think, Your Honor, that

6

"necessary" in this statute plays a function

7

similar to the word "necessary" in the statute

8

that the Court recently considered in Ayestas.

9

It means ordinary, reasonable, expected.

10

And I want to stress that district

11

courts make those sort of determinations all

12

the time.

13

requested restitution orders because they find

14

that the expenses requested were

15

disproportionate to the task or that they

16

weren't actually focused on the specific

17

offense of conviction and that they were

18

looking into something else.

19

They cut down restitution orders or

Petitioner's rule is categorical.

He

20

wants to say that even in a circumstance where

21

it's undisputed that the victim's investigation

22

is extremely helpful to the government, even

23

where it's a perfectly reasonable

24

investigation, even where the victim takes

25

steps to minimize its expenses, they still

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

cannot get restitution in those cases if it's

2

-- the investigation happens to occur before

3

the government kicks off its case.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm not

5

sure that GE took steps to limit its expenses.

6

I mean, it -- it hired very expensive law firms

7

to conduct the investigation.

8

you're going to have the district judge in all

9

of these cases being asked to do that, did they

10

really have to, you know, have partners work on

11

this as opposed to associates?

12

to hire this law firm?

13

this?

And -- and

Did they have

Couldn't they have done

14

And it's not clear to me that the

15

Congress would want the district courts to

16

spend a lot of time on that sort of restitution

17

litigation.

18

MR. HUSTON:

So -- so two -- Your -­

19

Your Honor, I think that the statute equips

20

district courts to make exactly those type of

21

determinations in Section 3664(f).

22

probation office will prepare a report

23

summarizing the expenses.

24

subject to adversarial testing.

25

The

That report is

preponderance of the evidence.

3

where necessary, district courts can refer

disputed issues out to a magistrate judge.

5

And in cases

So district courts simply have not had

6

trouble, in the 22 years that this statute has

7

been on the books, making those sort of

8

determinations.

9

I -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, here's another

10

tricky one, for me, along the lines of what the

11

Chief Justice was just asking.

12

you're making the case.

13

It seems to me

How do we determine whether an

14

internal investigation is even necessary for

15

the government's work?

16

government can do its own investigation too.

17

So how is an internal investigation that

18

precedes the government's ever necessary in

19

that -- in any sense?

20

conduct internal investigations for their own

21

reasons?

22

derivative suits, they have to worry about

23

class action suits, they have to worry about

24

compliance with SEC regulations, among many

25

other things.

I mean, presumably, the

And don't companies also

They have to worry about shareholder

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

How is a district judge ever going to

2

be able to determine whether an internal

3

investigation was necessary for the criminal

4

investigation by the government?

5

MR. HUSTON:

Your Honor, you're

6

absolutely right that companies conduct those

7

sort of investigations all the time.

8

those kinds of investigations that discover

9

frauds and that reveal the evidence that we use

10

to prosecute people every day.

11
12

But it's

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You're not answering

my question, counsel.

13

How is -- how is a district judge, the

14

poor district judge, supposed to make a

15

determination which one's necessary for the

16

government's investigation and which one's not?

17

I don't doubt they help the government.

18

don't doubt the government's happy to receive

19

that information and use the resources, the

20

private resources, to conduct its public

21

business.

22

to decide what was necessary?

23

MR. HUSTON:

I

But how is a district judge supposed

Well, Your Honor, we

24

don't think that the investigation of the

25

offense in this statute refers to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

government's work.

2

reason why Congress would not have so limited

3

it is for exactly the reason that I just gave,

4

because of the value that internal

5

investigations add.

6

And we think that the

What we think "necessary" does in this

7

statute is exclude the sort of unreasonable

8

investigations that -- that everyone would

9

think ought to be outside the realm of

10
11

possibility.

And to the extent -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do with

12

the argument that the -- in the end, all that

13

this does is to assure that the wrongdoer's

14

life will be miserable after he finishes his

15

prison sentence because he will never be able

16

to pay these huge attorney fee restitution

17

awards and you're not going to help the victim

18

because the award will be uncollectible?

19

MR. HUSTON:

Your Honor, to the extent

20

that the restitution award in this case is

21

large, it is large because Petitioner conducted

22

a massive fraud.

23

than two years.

24

nobody to blame but himself for the amount of

25

the award.

He stole $25 million in less
And so I think he really has

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

But to your point about the fact that

2

restitution awards often go uncollected, again,

3

I think that really is just a function of

4

Congress's deliberate choice in the MVRA to say

5

that restitution should be focused exclusively

6

on the losses that the victim incurred without

7

regard to the economic circumstances of the

8

defendant.

amount was, to collect 25, they spent 15.

The

$11 million is the amount of unpaid loans that

GE Capital was not able to recover.

again, that's not disputed.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

that.

I

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

thought.
MR. HUSTON:

-- but, again,

24

$11 million of that is not disputed.

25

we're talking about today is about

What

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

$4.9 million.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it seems

3

pretty clear the government would never have

4

done that on its own, try to figure out whether

5

the restitution ought to be $4 million or

6

$8 million from a guy who's never going to pay

7

any of it.

8

instead we'll spend a little time on the mass

9

murder down the street.

10

They would have said, I think,

And I'm just wondering if you're

11

talking about expenses that the private party

12

incurred for its own purposes to find out how

13

to adjust its books, what it had lost, why

14

should the victim be compelled to pay that or,

15

as Justice Ginsburg suggests, just carry it on

16

-- on his own back, when it's something that

17

the government would never have done on its

18

own?

19

MR. HUSTON:

Congress was aware, Your

20

Honor, and what the legislative history of the

21

MVRA says is that it recognizes that frauds

22

like this one impose costs on victims that are

23

more than just the property that's taken.

24
25

Although the award in this case is
substantial, again, that's just a function of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59
1

the complexity of the -- the investigation that

2

was necessary.

And that's not been challenged

3

in this case.

So we're really not -- it's far

4

too late for Petitioner to go in and claim that

5

any of these particular expenses were too much

6

and they should have hired a less -- a law firm

7

with less expensive fees, although when

8

district courts do make those -- or, excuse me,

9

when -- when defendants do make those sort of

10

challenges, courts hear them all the time.

11

Both the Cuti case and the Amato case,

12

that are discussed in our brief, involve

13

examples of restitution awards being challenged

14

and then adjusted by district courts in those

15

ways.

16
17
18
19
20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm not

sure if that -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is the criminal -­

I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not sure

21

if that helps you.

I mean, then your -- your

22

answer seems to be, well, they can always

23

litigate these things.

24

government going to be conducting an

25

investigation over money that nobody's ever

So now, not only is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

going to pay, but they're going to be

2

litigating about it, taking the district court

3

time to figure out whether the attorneys' fees

4

should be $2 million or $1.5 million, again,

5

when no one's going to get the money anyway.

6

MR. HUSTON:

Your -- Your -- Your

7

Honor, that is because Congress made a very

8

deliberate choice in the MVRA to say that

9

restitution should be focused exclusively on

10

the amount of loss that the victim incurred.

11

And even in a case where everyone

12

realizes that the defendant is never going to

13

be able to pay it back, which I think, to be

14

fair, is not this case, Petitioner was quite a

15

wealthy man before this -- before his crime,

16

and there's reason to believe that, you know,

17

the government is -- believes that he has

18

assets that we'll -- that we will attempt to

19

collect afterwards.

20

So it's not the case that nothing will

21

ever be collected.

But, in any event, I think

22

that even in cases where restitution goes

23

uncollected, it's just a function of Congress's

24

deliberate choice that the restitution system

25

we have should measure the amount of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

victim's loss.

2

loss in this case includes these -- these

3

expenses.

4

And the amount of the victim's

suit?

10

MR. HUSTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

Can it

There's

an estoppel provision in -- in the MVRA that
functions that way.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So

12

that means that a corporation, which, as

13

Justice Kagan pointed out, corporate losses of

14

these kind are not specified anywhere in this

15

provision.

16

Liability is taken as a given.

17

to do is prove their restitution amount.

18

Correct?

19
20
21

They can go into civil court.

MR. HUSTON:

All they have

That's basically correct,

Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So tell me why

22

Congress would have been worried about that

23

when it seemed more worried about the

24

individual expenses that people are unlikely to

25

go to civil court for.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

MR. HUSTON:

Well, again, there's

2

really no dispute at all that corporations are

3

victims of frauds and that they are entitled to

4

recover.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They're entitled

6

to their losses, but you're asking for

7

something more than what's specified here,

8

according to your adversary.

9

MR. HUSTON:

Well -- well, I think

10

what we're asking for -- they are a victim, and

11

the statute says that victims who incur

12

expenses during the investigation or

13

prosecution of the offense are entitled to

14

recover.

15

And the other -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, except that

16

Congress, unlike other provisions that

17

specified attorneys' fees, putting the victim

18

whole, proximate causation, Congress in -­

19

instead chose very specific categories here.

20

MR. HUSTON:

And we -- I think we fit

21

into this category, Your Honor.

We fit into

22

(b)(4).

23

say about the civil lawsuits is that's really

24

not an effective remedy because the action

25

moment is not about getting the judgment; it's

But the -- the other thing I want to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

about collection.

2

And offering -- getting a criminal

3

restitution award offers substantial advantages

4

as against attempting to pursue civil

5

litigation in terms of the ability to recover.

6

The government has all sorts of tools that we

7

use to attempt to recover criminal restitution

8

awards that are not available to judgment

9

holders.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This company you

11

told me earlier got $15 million back without

12

the government.

13

MR. HUSTON:

In the bankruptcy -­

14

well, they got -- in the bankruptcy proceeding,

15

Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

government who helped them do that.

18

themselves.

19

MR. HUSTON:

It was

That's right, Your Honor,

20

but I think that only illustrates Congress's

21

wisdom in allowing these -- these restitution

22

expenses.

23

the $11 million that Petitioner does not

24

contest, it would not be made whole because, in

25

order to get to this point, GE Capital had to

If you were to pay back GE Capital

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

incur substantial investigation expenses, and

2

participating in the bankruptcy proceedings,

3

those are losses that are real to this company,

4

which is a victim of the fraud within the

5

meaning of the MVRA.

6

And they were proximately caused by

7

the defendant's offense, which is the

8

definition of victim that's in Section

9

3663A(a).

10

So I think for all of these reasons it

11

makes sense that Congress would design a

12

restitution system that would focus on

13

restoring the victim to its position before the

14

offense.

15

substantive purpose of this statute is to award

16

full restitution.

17
18

Unless there are further questions,
we'd ask that the judgment be affirmed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL L. GEYSER

MR. GEYSER:
Justice.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

A few quick points.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

My very able friend has referred

2

repeatedly to a statute providing for

3

make-whole relief to provide the full amount of

4

restitution.

5

Of course, that is not what subsection

6

(b)(4) says, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out.

7

That's what other statutes say.

8

offense-specific provisions provide that kind

9

of relief when Congress wanted to.

10

The

If Congress were concerned about

11

overlooking expenses like child care and

12

transportation, it would have phrased this

13

entirely differently.

14

you can recover necessary expenses, including

15

child care and transportation.

16

fact, is what Congress did in the

17

offense-specific statutes.

18

It would have said that

And that, in

19

recovery, and the full amount includes the

20

following categories, including their

21

attorneys' fees and the kind of expenses

opposite formulation here, invoking the classic

24

ejusdem generis formulation.

25

Congress chose the polar

6

It does not dictate the outer bounds of a

8

9

do that.

10

This Court rejected the

4

offense.

6

That, of course, has nothing

These are exactly the kinds of

7

expenses that a corporation reasonably incurs

8

in an internal investigation, and it's

9

incredibly hard to disaggregate those expenses

10

from the expenses that would be necessary for

11

the government to incur or that the government

12

even would have bothered to do in the first

13

place.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Did your client

15

point that out to the district court judge

16

here?

17

MR. GEYSER:

No, Your Honor.

And to

18

be clear, we're not challenging the -- that

19

specific line item, where it just illustrates

20

the difficulty of engaging in these sorts of

21

inquiries in the first place.

22

In terms of private investigations, a

23

private investigation that starts before the

24

government's investigation begins, if that's

25

fully covered, it leads to deep anomalies in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1
2

the statute.
It would mean that the private

3

investigation could occur and they don't -- the

4

corporation doesn't even have to disclose

5

results to the government because it would be

6

an expense incurred during participation in

7

that private investigation.

8
9

There is no statutory hook even
requiring the corporation to turn over what

10

they found.

11

in mind in a statute that's talking about the

12

investigation and prosecution of the offense

with those terms in the singular.
