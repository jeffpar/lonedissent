ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

12

Congress in 1998 reacted to a new

13

problem.

After its 1995 Reform Act, which

14

dealt with the crisis of abuse of federal

15

claims in federal court, plaintiffs had

16

responded by shifting their litigation to state

17

court.

18

were happening; they were just happening in

19

state court.

The upshot was that the pre-'95 abuses

20

Congress, in the Securities Litigation

21

Uniform Standards Act, SLUSA, took three steps.

22

First, it precluded certain causes of action.

23

Second, it modified its anti-removal bar.

24

third, it eliminated concurrent jurisdiction

25

for many '33 Act federal claims in state court.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And,

Official
4
1

Respondents disagree with this third

2

one, but the text, structure, and purpose are

3

all against them.

4

understanding our argument is this:

5

County brought the exact same complaint that

6

they did here, alleging a federal '33 Act

7

claim, but did one thing differently, they also

8

brought a state law claim, they'd be knocked

9

out of state court.

10

And the best way of
If Beaver

That's their own reading.

But, they say, because they didn't

11

bring their state law count, they are now -­

12

the state law claim, they are now entitled to

13

bring their federal claim in state court.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

MR. KATYAL:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Katyal -­

That makes zero sense.
Well, one could

17

say, with respect to your argument, that

18

Congress chose a rather obtuse way of saying

19

that federal courts shall have exclusive

20

jurisdiction.

21

covered class actions related to claims under

22

the '33 Act, federal courts shall have

23

exclusive jurisdiction, period, and that would

24

be clear and everybody would understand and you

25

would prevail.

It could have simply said, in

But the Congress certainly took an odd
route to getting there.

3

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Ginsburg, we

4

agree with you that this is an obtuse way of

5

getting there.

6

have written a much better statute than our

7

friends across the street or so on, but I do

8

think it's the best way of understanding the

9

text.

10

And, you know, this body could

I'll explain why in a moment.
And as I was saying a moment before,

11

the anomaly on the other side is far worse.

12

This would then -- in no other statute that

13

they point to, that I've ever heard of, does

14

bringing a state count force you out of state

15

court, but that's their reading.

16

Congress is going to do something that strange,

17

you would expect them to have said so -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And if

I'm sorry, I

19

thought the whole purpose, the main purpose, of

20

SLUSA was just that, to ensure that claims of

21

this particular type were not covered under

22

state law but covered under federal law.

23

accept that that was the main purpose of

24

Congress's position, what difference does it

25

make who adjudicates the claim if both courts

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Sotomayor, we

3

disagree with the premise and what it

4

eventually leads you to in your -- in your

5

question to me in terms of your conclusion.

6

we disagree that the main purpose was

7

preclusion of state claims.

8

nothing saying so.

9

the actual statutory findings in the text of

So

They pointed to

And I'll walk you through

10

the statute which I think rebel at that.

11

And then even if it were a main

12

purpose to deal with the precluded claims,

13

there's certainly nothing to exclude, and I

14

think there's legislative history and the

15

statute itself is pretty clear that Congress

16

also had in mind the abuse that was going on

17

because these federal claims were being brought

18

to -- were being brought in state court.

19

you know, the text of the statute itself,

20

Justice Sotomayor, says that.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And,

Doesn't your -­

22

doesn't your reading contain an inherent

contradiction?

Isn't there a tension

MR. KATYAL:

No, I don't think there's

As our reply brief, you know, I

9

think, outlines, it's exactly actually the

10

compromise that was struck in the '34 Exchange

11

Act because the Exchange Act -­

Well, you're -­

there's an inherent tension in the two "except"

-- they're

contradictory on that.

19

MR. KATYAL:

I don't think they're

20

contradictory.

I think that what our reading

21

does is leave the '33 and '34 Acts in exactly

22

the same position; that is to say that both of

23

them say if you're bringing a federal claim,

24

either '33 or '34, you can't bring it in state

25

court.

You're ousted of jurisdiction.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I'm sorry.

2

Your -- your -- your reading of that first

3

"except" clause -­

4

MR. KATYAL:

Uh-huh.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- is that it

6

covers all covered class actions as defined in

7

p(f)(2).

8

only as those that have 50 or -­

P(f)(2) defines covered class actions

9

MR. KATYAL:

Correct.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

people, a certain amount of damages.

MR. KATYAL:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- 50 or more

Correct.
That could include

14

federal or state law claims.

15

reading, this reference to "except" is

16

definitional, p(f)(2).

17

MR. KATYAL:

Under your

Justice Sotomayor, you're

18

right to say that under our reading the except

19

-- the jurisdiction that is ousted of the state

20

court is greater than what is precluded by

21

Congress.

22

trying to say is that's exactly what happened

23

in the '34 Act.

reason, because as this Court said in

Congress is the master of that and can -- they

That's

Now, you had asked about the

The purpose is found

This is the text of the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could we -- I'm sorry,

17

could we -- could we just talk about the text

18

before we speak about the purpose -­

19

MR. KATYAL:

Sure.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- which -- because,

21

you know, "except as provided" in 77p, the

22

natural way to read that is we look at 77p, the

23

whole thing, and we see what's the "except"

24

that's provided in.

25

ancillary definitional provision that all it

We don't look to an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10

does is define a term.

We look for a rule that

2

might be in conflict, that could be taken to be

3

in conflict, with the jurisdictional provision.

4

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -­

So, you know, it just

6

seems as though your interpretation does a very

7

odd thing, textually, when you read "except as

8

provided" in Section 77p to say let's look to a

9

definition in that section.

10

MR. KATYAL:

So, Justice Kagan, you're

11

reading from Section 22(a), the "except"

12

clause, which is also v -- which is also

13

77v(a).

14

8a.

15

clause says "except as provided" in Section 16.

16

And you'd say -- if that alone, which is the

17

part you read to me, were enough, you would

18

say, well, do you look to the definition?

19

unclear.

20

it says "with respect to covered class

21

actions."

22

"except" clause.

23

It's found in our blue brief at page

It's

But it's more than that because then

So there are two halves to this

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I looked through that to see

said it's obtuse.

You

That's flattering.

13

(Laughter.)

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And we have very smart

15

lawyers here who have come up with creative

16

interpretations, but this is gibberish.

17

-- it is just gibberish.

18

It's

It says -- the provision that was read

19

says that the state courts have jurisdiction

20

over federal claims, except as provided in

21

Section 77p, which says nothing whatsoever

22

about jurisdiction for state -- for federal

23

claims.

24

MR. KATYAL:

So, Justice -­

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what are -- what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1
2

are we supposed to do with this?
MR. KATYAL:

Justice Alito, I -- I

3

think I'd say three things about that.

First

4

is -- as I was saying to Justice Ginsburg, I

5

don't think the statute's by any stretch a

6

model of clarity, but I don't go so far as to

7

say it is gibberish.

8

that book did talk about how if you really

9

can't figure it out, then you look to, for

Your late colleague in

10

example, the statutory findings, that even as a

11

textualist as he was, said, you know, look to

12

that to try and figure out what Congress was

13

getting at.

14

Sotomayor's claim -- question and the blue

15

brief at page 20, because the statutory

16

findings really do tell you, I think, what

17

Congress is doing.

18

And this returns me to Justice

They're as follows:

"Since enactment

19

of that [Reform Act] legislation, considerable

20

evidence has been presented to Congress that a

21

number of securities class action lawsuits have

22

shifted from Federal to State courts."

23

And then "this shift has prevented

24

that Act from fully achieving its objectives,"

25

and then "it is appropriate to enact national

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

standards [...] while preserving the

2

appropriate enforcement powers of State

3

securities regulators and not changing the

4

current treatment of individual lawsuits."

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, that

6

says nothing about ousting the state courts.

7

It says providing national standards that will

8

control state enforcement agencies.

9
10

So whether it's state court or federal
court, it's still the same national standards.

11
12

MR. KATYAL:
national -­

13
14

Well, it's not the same

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -- but -- but

going -­

15

MR. KATYAL:

-- standards because

16

Congress cared very much about the procedures.

17

The whole Reform Act did things like say you

18

can't have professional plaintiffs, there are

19

limits on attorneys' fees, all sorts of stuff

20

--

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What was very

22

clear in the Act is that there are certain

23

sections that were clearly intended to be

24

national, certain things that were and were not

25

covered, and then there were, you're right,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

some procedural aspects, but nowhere in those

2

procedural aspects did Congress say they have

3

to be followed both in state and federal court.

4

MR. KATYAL:

In the Reform Act, you're

5

absolutely right, but I do think that is the

6

way of understanding what SLUSA was doing.

7

It's precisely because they weren't followed,

8

Justice Sotomayor, in state court -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

go back to your definition?

11

action under, I call it 77p, it's just easier

12

for me, has a bunch of different subsections.

13

MR. KATYAL:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can we -- can we
A covered class

Yes.
You're relying on

15

the definitional one.

16

pertinent ones also talks about class action

17

limitations, removal of covered class actions

18

by referencing "p" in its entirety.

19

But each of the

What is either illogical, contextually

20

wrong, or improper about looking at all of the

21

provisions of "p" that talk with respect to

22

covered class actions?

23

MR. KATYAL:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

I -­
Because b and c

are certainly talking with respect to covered

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

class actions.

2

MR. KATYAL:

So I certainly agree with

3

you, Justice Sotomayor, that when Congress used

4

the -- and pointed to the entire clause, it

5

could point to any part of the clause, you

6

know, and I think the definition does give you

7

the best indicia of it.

8
9

But there's nothing that says that you
should only look, as my friend on the other

10

side does -- says, only look at the preclusion

11

provisions.

12
13

After all, these are about
preclusions.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, he's not doing

15

that.

16

that mentions or talks about the covered class

17

action.

18

He's saying you look at every provision

MR. KATYAL:

And if you did, then

19

you'd look to the definition as well.

20

would say, as I was saying to Justice Kagan,

21

except as provided in Section 16, so you look

22

to Section 16, with respect to covered class

23

actions, and you look to what that is.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that

Well, if your reading

were right, Mr. Katyal, it would be written

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

something like:

2

actions as defined in -- not as provided by -­

3

as defined in 77p(f)(2), not just 77p.

4

Except with respect to class

So there are two ways in which your

5

reading really does seem at odds with the

6

statutory text.

7

text says provided in, you're saying defined

8

by, and, second, the -- the statute makes clear

9

you look to 77p as a whole, not to some

10
11

First by not saying the -- the

sub-subsection within it.
MR. KATYAL:

So I don't think either

12

of those means that our reading is at odds,

13

Justice Kagan.

14

that, you know, as I was saying to Justice

15

Ginsburg, Congress had other ways of writing

16

the statute that are clear, that could have

17

been clearer, but this Court confronts this -­

18

and this returns to Justice Alito's question -­

19

all the time, in big cases like Burwell, in

20

small cases like Perry versus Merit Systems

21

Protection Board last term, you're dealing with

22

the statute that, maybe if you look at it one

23

way it's gibberish, maybe some of you could

24

have written it better, but it still has to be

25

given some meaning.

I think all that suggests is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

And our reading of -­

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Under your reading

3

-- under your reading, Mr. Katyal, are there

4

any 1933 Act claims that could be brought,

5

federal claims, under the 1933 Act that could

6

be brought in state court?

7

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely, Justice

8

Ginsburg.

And that's why, to return to your

9

first question, why Congress didn't say

10

exclusive jurisdiction as they did in the '34

11

Act.

12

Congress in SLUSA made -- took care,

13

and this is Finding 5 that I had read to

14

Justice Sotomayor earlier, to say, look, we

15

want to preserve the vast majority of

16

concurrent jurisdiction in state courts.

17

That's individual lawsuits and class actions

18

that aren't covered.

19

actions or actions not seeking money damages or

20

actions for fewer than 50.

21

So that's derivative

But if you accept their reading, what

22

you're essentially doing is saying, look,

23

Congress in this statute, they built this super

24

safe house, you know, in SLUSA with a front

25

door that was locked that had alarm systems to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

bar against federal court abuse of federal

2

claims -- that's the Reform Act -- and then the

3

side doors they locked because they were

4

worried about state court abuse and federal

5

court abuse of state law claims -- that's

6

Justice Sotomayor's point -- but they didn't

7

even build the back of the house.

8
9
10

They didn't build even a door to deal
with the problem of all of this being repleaded
now in state courts.

These are federal claims.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- kind of claims?
Well, but you're -­

13

you're forgetting that most securities actions

14

are Exchange Act actions.

15

Securities Act actions.

They're not

16

And for that, Congress did everything

17

it wanted because Exchange Act actions are all

18

in the federal courts.

19

jurisdiction there.

20

There is exclusive

So essentially what was happening was

21

that in Exchange Act actions, it -- that

22

exclusive jurisdiction was being compromised by

23

the ability of people to bring state law

24

actions.

25

And Congress completely shut that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

down.

2

with respect to Exchange Act actions, which are

3

the lion's share of securities lawsuits.

4

So Congress did everything it wanted

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Kagan, I don't

5

know about lion's share or not, but it is very

6

clear, manifestly clear, that SLUSA dealt with

7

both problems, '33 and '34.

8

separate titles that deal with this.

There are two

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Assuming -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

My textual argument

2

question is this.

3

what I think your argument, but perhaps not the

4

government's argument, requires us to read c in

5

a pretty unnatural way, that's -- that's p(c),

6

see, because it says "as set forth in

7

subsection (b)."

8
9

My textual question is that

So what you want us to do is to look
at subsection (b) and you -- take that as

10

referring to -- which is possible, but it's

11

tough -- not having the words "based upon

12

statutory or common law of any state."

13

You see, because -- because if it -­

14

if it picks that up, well, then -- then all

15

we're talking about is those actions that have

16

the state action within it are removable, which

17

explains the anomaly that you started out with

18

and it would just be an anomaly and you'd say,

19

well, it isn't a practical anomaly because no

20

sensible lawyer is going to include the state

21

one anymore.

22
23

He'll just include the '33 one.

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

So, Justice

Breyer, I get -­

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

So how do I -- how do

25

I deal with that textual problem?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

MR. KATYAL:

Certainly, I think the

2

Solicitor General's way of dealing with that is

3

available to you, but I think that our argument

4

does not depend on, you know, on read -­

5

reading the removal provision the way it does.

6

All our argument depends on -- it's a

7

straight-forward reading, and it -- you know, I

8

understand Justice Kagan -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

It says "a covered

10

security as set forth in subsection (b)."

11

there are commas around the (b), around that

12

phrase I just read, I agree, but the most

13

natural thing is it's referring to those

14

covered actions that are referred to in (b).

15

And what it refers to in (b) are covered

16

actions all right, but -- but they're involving

17

state law.

18

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

Now,

So my only point

19

to you is the first -- our argument is really

20

about the first half, the jurisdiction clause.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. KATYAL:

Yeah.

And the jurisdiction

23

clause is all you need to look at.

It says

24

that there's concurrent jurisdiction, that's

25

what the '33 Act said, except as provided in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Section 16 with respect to covered class

2

actions.

3

state court have jurisdiction, you look to

4

Section 16 and you look to the definition of a

5

covered class action.

6

And so, in order to decide does a

Our argument is that is, you know,

7

it's not the -- you know, the usual way

"provided" is -- is written -- Justice Kagan's

right to say that -- but it's not such an

unusual way.

There are other statutes that do

These are ways of doing this.
And, again, I think that, you know, if

17

Congress was going to do what my friend on the

18

other side says -­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. KATYAL:

Uh-huh.

-- which is to say that

21

by bringing a state law count in your federal

22

complaint, you now are ousted out of state

23

court, one would expect that -­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

You -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why not -- why

2

not make the second "except" clause read

3

identically?

4

your theory, assume somebody brings a 1933 Act

5

claim, in state court, tied to a non-1933 state

6

law action.

7
8

But the Congress didn't.

Under

Under your theory, what happens to
that case?

9

MR. KATYAL:

10

Yep.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It can't get

11

removed because under (c) you can only remove

12

those claims that are -- state law claims that

13

are based on 1933.

14

remove them.

15

And this says you can't

So now what happens?

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

So, Justice

16

Sotomayor, you're exactly right that, under our

17

reading, the preclusion is narrower than the

18

ousted jurisdiction in SLUSA so that there is a

19

category of cases, non-covered securities or

20

claims that aren't about fraud, in which there

21

is no preclusion, but we believe there is no

22

state court jurisdiction over these federal

23

claims.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So your theory is

that on those claims they just get ousted out

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

of court, even though they have a non-covered,

2

completely viable non-'33 state law action?

3
4

MR. KATYAL:

Exactly.

And that's

exactly the balance -­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's -- that's a

6

fairly extreme result on a reading that bucks

7

the presumption, and one that exists when

8

there's an ambiguity, that says we presume in

9

favor of concurrent jurisdiction.

10

So you're taking a very strong

11

presumption, turning it on its head, and saying

12

we're ousting state courts over jurisdiction of

13

securities actions that have nothing to do with

14

federal law.

15

MR. KATYAL:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

that's exactly right.

what you're saying.

So -- so two things.

Well, I don't think

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

First is

Why is it not

exactly right?
MR. KATYAL:

Because, first, I don't

24

think this is some anomalous reading.

25

reading the '33 Act exactly the way the '34

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, this Act does

not preempt those state law non-1933,

4

non-federal actions.

5

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Sotomayor, with

for the 1934 Act.

claims.
MR. KATYAL:

-- in the '34 Act, it's

18

precluding the same basket of state claims as

19

the '33 Act, and the jurisdiction, the way we

20

read it, is exactly the same.

21

same category of cases, non-covered securities,

22

non-fraud cases, there's no jurisdiction in

23

state courts for them, but they are -- but they

24

don't happen to be precluded under both the '33

The answer to this is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

31

found in the Senate report brief -- Senate

2

report at page 4 in which they said we are very

3

concerned for federalism reasons about

4

preclusion because it's such strong medicine.

5

But when we're dealing with jurisdiction, we

6

have the ability to paint with a broader brush

7

without interfering with federalism principles.

8

Here, we're only talking about federal

9

court count -- federal court causes of action,

10

and all Congress is saying is that they are the

11

master of that and you can't bring those in

12

state court when it's subject to very different

13

standards than you can in federal court.

you make this as a -- as taking -- allowing a

state court to hear a federal claim that

19

because you agree with the government that you

20

could remove this case to federal court and

We think our textual reading is better

because we actually give effect to the 12 words

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM

13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

14

IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE

15
16

MR. KEDEM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

17

Petitioners are correct that Congress

18

enacted SLUSA to reestablish federal courts as

19

the preferred venue for large class actions

20

involving nationally traded securities.

21

But it did so not by eliminating state

22

court jurisdiction over suits involving federal

23

claims but by permitting removal of such suits

24

from state to federal court.

25

Perhaps a good place to start, Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

Breyer, would be with your question about the

2

removal provision and how, under the text of

3

that provision, removal of actions that only

4

involve federal claims is permitted.

5

think it's easiest to understand if you're

6

looking directly at it, 77p, subsection (c), on

7

page 1a of the red brief.

8
9

And I

I think the question for the Court is
whether the limiting clause, as set forth in

10

subsection (b), modifies the phrase immediately

11

before it, "involving a covered security," or

12

instead modifies the phrase that comes at the

13

beginning of the sentence, "any covered class

14

action."

15

If it modifies "any covered class

16

action," Justice Breyer, I think you would be

17

correct that what Congress would mean by that

18

is the type of class action that's specified at

19

subsection (b), which would have all of the

20

criteria, including that it would be pleaded

21

under state law.

22

But if we're correct that instead it

23

modifies "involving a covered security," then I

24

think you would look to subsection (b) to

25

answer the question what type of connection to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

a covered security did Congress have in mind

2

when it used that phrase?

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why, if all

4

they wanted -- the parenthetical "as set forth

5

in subsection (b)" -- that's the words we're

6

talking about, right?

7

MR. KEDEM:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. KEDEM:

10

That's correct.
And it's in commas.

That's correct.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why wouldn't they say

11

"as set forth" and then they'd refer to (2)(a),

12

the definition of covered class action?

13

MR. KEDEM:

I think what we're talking

14

about is not just the definition of covered

15

class action.

16

phrase "involving a covered security," which is

17

a phrase that doesn't have its own definition.

It's what Congress meant by the

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. KEDEM:

Ah.

And to figure out what

20

that means, you look at (b)(1) and (b)(2),

21

which talk about certain types of misconduct in

22

connection with the purchase or sale of a

23

covered security.

24
25

We think that's -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

True, but then -­

then -- suppose, all right, involving a covered

Heritage Reporting Corporation

class action.

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

for a few reasons it makes the most sense to

12

phrase.

13
14
15

First of all, based on the rule of the
last -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Kedem, so now

16

I understand your argument, but -- but still it

17

doesn't really fit with (b)(1) and (2).

18

mean, if it were just involving a covered

19

security, as set forth in subsection (b), you

20

would look to something which told you what a

21

covered security is.

22

I

But (b)(1) and (2) don't do that.

23

They talk about, you know, the kind of conduct

24

that's illegal.

MR. KEDEM:

That's right.

modifying "covered security."

5

6

involve the security in the relevant sense.

7

Yeah.

Because it's not just
It's modifying
And

Perhaps it would be useful to consider

8

an example of a hypothetical statute in which

9

Congress imposed liability for "impeding

10

interstate commerce as set forth in Section

11

100."

12
13

In that case, I think you would want
to look to Section 100 -­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. KEDEM:

Ah, I see.

Okay.

-- and the type of

16

impeding acts that are described there to tell

17

you what it means to impede in the relevant

18

sense.

19
20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So your point

-- your point is involving a covered security?

21

MR. KEDEM:

That's right.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you have to both

23

know what a covered security is, and you also

24

have to know is what kind of involvement.

25

MR. KEDEM:

That's right.

The first

37

part is very -­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so for covered

security you could have just referred to (3)

4

where they define it, but you have to know a

5

second thing, which is how is it involved?

6

MR. KEDEM:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. KEDEM:

That's right.

We think

that's the better reading, first -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. KEDEM:

13

And (1) and (2) in

(b) tell you how it is involved?

9
10

-- based on the rule of

the last antecedent -­

-- under which the

16

limiting clause is most naturally applied to

the thing that comes immediately before it,

18

rather than to something that comes earlier in

the sentence.

MR. KEDEM:

Congress was concerned about both acts.

2

In addition to the rule of the last

3

antecedent, I would point to the fact that in

4

between our two candidates for the limiting

5

clause, "any covered class action" at the

6

beginning of the sentence and "involving a

7

covered security" later on, there's an

8

intervening phrase, "brought in any state

9

court."

10

And that phrase doesn't have any

11

obvious analog in subsection (b), which, as the

12

Court is well aware, applies regardless of

13

whether you're in federal or state court.

14

we think that strengthens the inference that

15

the limiting clause should be applied to the

16

thing adjacent to it.

both ways in Kircher.

that the two provisions, the scope of them is

22

identical, but it also said that they were

identical in that they both require certain

types of misconduct.

MR. KEDEM:

I think it was talking

about the types of misconduct at issue in 1 and

specific argument that the Court was

12

considering in Kircher was the argument that

13

the plaintiffs made that the case did not

14

belong in federal court because it didn't

15

involve the purchase or sale of a covered

16

security.

17

And the reason I think that is because the

under subsection (c).

this is the way we're going to do it.

MR. KEDEM:

It is SO far from

reality that it really strains credulity.

MR. KEDEM:

bit of a stretch.

I'm serious.

Is there

19

at a certain point at which we say this means

20

nothing, we can't figure out what it means,

and, therefore, it has no effect, it means

22

nothing?

to say it means something?

I would caution the Court

the policy arguments that Petitioners raise,

5

which we think are very important arguments,

6

and based on the findings of fact in SLUSA

7

these -- they are things that Congress was

8

concerned about, we think that our removal

argument gets to essentially the same place as

a policy matter but with a much more plausible

textual basis.

Part of the problem,

14

confusing as -- I mean, I might be wrong in how

I'm looking at it -- but as Justice Alito.

16

I'm thinking the drafter is given a

17

task and his task is to do two things,

18

economically, efficiently, I mean, that is

19

efficiently with words.

20

One thing he has to do is get rid of

21

these state actions.

That's one.

And the

22

second thing he has to do is to remove the

federal act cases into federal court.

And that's whether they're mixed, or not mixed,

or so forth.

If he was given that

task, this is the language that does it.

would expect there would be a report, and in

this report there would be an explanation such

as you gave me of the word "involving."

guess is there is no such report.

reading of the statute.
If what is meant is the contrary

21

reading, any covered class action of the sort

22

that's specified in subsection (b), it's not

clear what the words "involving a covered

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
When the Petitioners' lawyer stands up

10

and says in the first minute that his reading

11

is obtuse and when the Solicitor General's

12

lawyer spends the entire time on an argument

13

that isn't in any of their briefs in the case,

14

you know that the lawyers are scrambling to try

15

and figure out what the statute means.

16

And the way we think you would resolve

17

that is to recognize that these words actually

18

mean something.

19

They may not accomplish anything.

20

Court has said in cases like Manning that if

21

Congress is going to change this kind of law

22

significantly, you don't find elephants in

They may target a null set.

long-standing form of jurisdiction, and that's

24

25

And if you want to signal to the
lawyers how it is that we're supposed to

10

litigate these cases, that's probably not the

11

-- the best signal to send.

12

On the other hand, it's true, for

13

example, that if the Court were to understand

14

the Kircher decision that we do and the

15

structure between (b) and (c) in 77p as having

16

a parallel in v(a), one could effectively

17

resolve the removal question, but you could

18

only, essentially, resolve it in the favor of

19

non-removal.

think, to write an opinion honestly that says

21

what should happen here is these cases should

22

be removed under 77p(c).

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The mixed cases did exist

JUSTICE ALITO:

What sense does that

enough to include in the state court complaint

What -- what sense does that

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, Justice Alito,

18

it would make sure that there isn't confusion.

19

It would resolve an ambiguity.

20

It's not intended to do very much.

21

It's a conforming amendment.

We don't think

22

that the statute -- this provision, which isn't

23

discussed anywhere in the legislative history

24

at all, is intended to accomplish very much.

25

All it's intending to do, we think,

the jurisdictional provision.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

I'm answering

We don't think that it is

11

that the courts, without regard to whether or

12

not the defendant invokes p(b), do not have

13

jurisdiction.

14

result.

15

It actually accomplishes that

But no matter -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it just matching

16

the jurisdictional to the preclusion and

17

removal?

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

All right.

If you -­

19

if you told someone to write a statute that

20

says modify v(a) to make sure there isn't

21

jurisdiction over the cases we just banned, you

22

would use this exact language.

23

And the one thing I do want to be

24

clear on is that this phrase -- we do start

25

just with the simple text, that phrase, "except

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

as provided in section X with respect to

2

subject matter Y," everywhere in the U.S. Code

3

it's used refers to the -- the person to a

4

5

clause.

6

It's the opposite of a "notwithstanding"

It always has some measure of

7

superfluity -- superfluity.

8

just -- you've got two different provisions and

9

it tells you which one controls.

10
11

What it's doing is

A

"notwithstanding" provision -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Goldstein, why

12

-- why would Congress want to do that, given

13

that if the federal claim is in federal court,

14

there are, as Mr. Katyal pointed out, all these

15

restrictions on counsel and who's the

16

represented party?

17

federal claim in state court, and none of those

18

restrictions apply.

19

You have the same -- the

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's the usual rule,

20

Justice Ginsburg.

And, remember, we have a

21

really good indication that's what Congress

22

intended, because that's the PSLRA.

23

when it wrote the PSLRA against the backdrop of

24

state law -- state court secured -- '33 Act

25

class actions, wrote it to say that the

Congress,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

procedural protections apply in cases that are

2

-- are subject to the Federal Rules of Civil

3

Procedure.

4

What it decided to do is it matched

5

the same compromise that's in the '33 Act

6

itself, which is it allowed these cases to be

7

decided in state court.

8

state courts have their own discovery stays.

9

They have it in their rules.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

that.

12

on your side.

There, I -- I see

But, look, I have one textual question

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

And as we explained,

Sure.
My textual question,

which we're discussing now, is we go to v.

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.
And let's look at the

18

second part, which says "except as provided" in

19

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

-- you can't remove

it.

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Yes.
So that means if it's

provided -- "except" as provided in p(c).

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

Yep.
And it's talking

about the '33 Act.

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
All right.

So now

6

let's go over to -- to c.

7

talking about removal of a '33 Act case -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And since they're

A case with a '33 Act

claim.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

With a '33 Act claim.
Yes.
A case with a '33 Act

claim, we look to (c) and say (c), therefore,

14

must refer in part to cases with '33 Act

15

claims.

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18
19
20
21

Yes.
And if that's so,

since -- involving a covered security -­
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So, it would be a

mistake -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

-- if it refers to -­

22

if it refers to all of v, including the state

23

law problem, there is virtually no scope.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, that's not true.

It's the mistake.

Those are '34 Act cases by and large.
What might a clever

18

Well, what they might do is slap a '33

Act claim on here and say it's still within the

20

concurrent jurisdiction of the state courts.

So we're just going to make clear that's not

22

true.

That's all -­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

25

Okay.
-- that this provision

does.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE BREYER:
All right.

Now, this is my

2

choice then.

3

v for '33 Act, back to c, and when they talk

4

about (c), which refers to (b), they either

5

mean all of (b), which is a case with a state

6

law claim in it -­

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

The choice is reading

Yes.
-- and also a '33 Act

claim.

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
That's your view.
Yes.
Or the government's

14

view is that involving just refers to (1) and

15

(2) in (b) and so it refers to '33 Act claims

16

sitting there by themselves in state court,

17

too.

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Right.
That's my choice,

right?

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
And I've got to see

23

which of those two makes more sense in terms of

better.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

And so -­

Is that right?
Yes.

So here is why

18

you know that the '33 Act is the tail and the

19

'34 Act is the dog.

20

history and the findings that my friend talks

21

about refer to the shift of cases from federal

22

to state court.

23

shifted.

24
25

The -- the legislative

These are not cases that

'34 Act case shifted.
The '34 Act requires you to file in

federal court.

What happened is people instead

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

brought securities fraud cases under state law

2

in state court to avoid the PSLRA.

3

that's not what happened here.

4

Fine.

But

Our case was under the Securities Act

5

-- the '33 Act.

6

before the PSLRA.

7

in the PSLRA.

8

existing standard.

9

to the '33 Act continue to apply to it.

10

It was fine in state court
Congress didn't change that

It's not an evasion of any
All the rules that applied

So what Congress was concerned about

11

is a body of cases moving out of federal court

12

to state court.

13

the concurrent jurisdiction, non-removable, of

14

the state courts since the day the statute was

15

enacted.

16

These cases have been within

That's the compromise.
JUSTICE ALITO:

If a plaintiff files a

17

third -- files a claim in state court under a

18

state law cause of action that mirrors the '33

19

Act in the -- in the respects that are set out

20

in the statute, the state court can't entertain

21

that.

Am I right?

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is correct.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Now given that,

24

why in the world would Congress want the state

25

court to be able to entertain the real thing,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

an actual '33 Act?

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Because what Congress

3

is targeting is it just doesn't want this

4

resolved under state law.

5

under the '33 Act.

6

nationally-traded securities cases to be

7

litigated under federal law.

8
9
10

It wants it resolved

It does want these

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought it -- what

it wanted was it to be resolved under federal
procedural law?

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, that is not

12

uniformly true.

13

a concern of the evasion of the PSLRA.

14

Congress quite -­

15

Remember, we're talking about

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

Yeah, they wanted to

16

-- they wanted to resolve in accordance with

17

the PSLRA.

18
19
20
21
22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

And the PSLRA

JUSTICE ALITO:

Which wouldn't apply

-­

in state court.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Exactly right.

And so

23

that's our point and, that is, this is not an

24

evasion of the PSLRA.

25

delete the phrase in the PSLRA in cases that

If Congress wanted to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1

are subject to the Federal Rules of Civil

2

Procedure and extend the PSLRA to the state

3

court, or if it wanted to make all these cases

4

removable or if it wanted to refer to a

5

definition, there are 10 different easier ways

6

and more clear ways, rather than to pick up a

7

phrase that is not used in this way in the U.S.

8

Code anywhere at all.

9

I did want to just respond to an

10

anomaly, it's akin to the one that you just

11

described as possible, that my friend talks

12

about.

13

Respondents' view, if what you did was combine

14

a '33 Act claim with a state law claim, then we

15

admit that case would be litigated in federal

16

court.

17

He says this:

Look, under the

That is not correct.
Under 1441, this is what would happen,

18

is that the case would be removed to federal

19

court and under 1441(c) would mandate severing

20

out the prohibited state law claim and the case

21

would be remanded to state court and it would

22

be litigated in state court as a matter of law.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

The whole mixed case

24

thing doesn't make the first bit of sense to

25

me, that you've got the federal -- you have the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1

'33 Act claim and you have the prohibited state

2

act claim in state court.

3

So then the state court knows -- has

4

no jurisdiction whatsoever.

What's going to

5

happen?

6

plaintiff says, okay, fine, I dismiss my -- my

7

-- my state act claim.

The defendant moves to dismiss.

The

8

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Or the judge is going

10

to say, oh, it's too late.

11

to start out.

12

And then, if the statute of limitations hasn't

13

run, the plaintiff can just come back and file

14

the federal -- the '33 Act claim in state court

15

by itself.

16

You combined them

The whole thing is dismissed.

Right?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, but that's only

17

because of SLUSA because what SLUSA is doing is

18

barring the state law claim.

19

true if SLUSA didn't exist.

20

That wouldn't be

And I just think that you just have to

21

-- look, this is a narrow provision, not

22

discussed in the legislative history.

23

can't ask it to do the world, which is to undo

24

the jurisdiction of the '33 Act that has

25

existed a long time and, that is, it's another

Heritage Reporting Corporation

You

Official
70
1

anti-evasion principle.

2

I do want to respond as well to my

3

friend's statement that what he -- he says the

4

exact opposite thing.

5

produces a direct parallel between the '33 and

6

'34 Act, and then to Justice Ginsburg says it

7

treats the '33 and '34 Act wildly differently.

8

It does treat them quite differently,

9

He says his position

and that is he is pointing to statements in the

10

legislative history that suggest that some

11

members of Congress believe that all securities

12

cases would be litigated in federal court.

13

he leaves behind all of the non-class actions

14

and he picks up cases that SLUSA clearly was

15

not intended to apply to, and that is

16

non-covered securities.

But

17

SLUSA is quite clear about this, that

18

it is intended to respond only with respect to

19

the nationally-traded securities that are

20

defined as covered securities.

21

reading somehow picks up, according to the

22

Petitioners, all of the covered class actions,

23

even if it's not a nationally-traded security

24

at all.

25

But this

And it would be incredibly weird to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71
1

write a statute that says, except as provided

2

in 77p with respect to covered securities, and

3

to do something radically different from what

4

with respect to those that involve

nonetheless, it is the case that we do give

Okay?

And I do think

12

it's very useful that, except as provided and

that it would be completely unnecessary because

parts of v that don't do anything.

that.

5

removable.

6

7

We would want those -- those actions to be

8

removable, be consistent with Congress's other

9

purposes -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But then it says "and

20

shall be subject to subsection (b)."

And all

21

that subsection (b) does, the way this (c)

22

provision works is it makes a category of cases

23

removable only so that a court can dismiss

24

them.

25

It's like they were worried that state courts

That's the point of subsection (c).

them removable to be dismissed.

That if state courts

There has to be, because the mixed case ends up

in part being in federal court.

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It does not because

3

under 1441(c) it gets remanded.

4

part of the case, as a matter of law, gets

5

cleaved off and gets sent back to state court.

6

It does not stay and get litigated in federal

7

court.

I'm sorry -­

Mr. Katyal was just

wrong about that.

The federal

are you citing?

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

14 -- 28 U.S.C.

1441(c), it's the removal provision.

15

happens is if you have a mixed case, the

16

combined federal and state cases that are

17

subject to p(b), it gets removed.

18

law, 1441(c), says if you have a otherwise

19

non-removable provision combined -- claim

20

combined with a removable claim, that what you

21

do is you break them in half and you send the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
I mean, either on the

one hand, your view, this is designed just to

get rid of the state actions.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.
On their view, it is

designed to do two things.

Four minutes, Mr. Katyal.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

23

MR. KATYAL:

24

Four -- four points.

25

Thank you,

Thank you.
First, Congress

took the affirmative step of modifying the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
79
1

preexisting concurrent jurisdiction provision

2

in Section 22.

3

that some meaning.

4

We're the only ones who give

Justice Gorsuch, this is not about

5

surplusage, the canon of surplusage.

This is

6

obliteration.

7

explanation for what Congress did when it added

8

those 12 words.

They can't give you an

9

And that's why my friend says, oh,

10

there's some canon against doing -- a canon

11

that you have to do things a simple way.

12

is no such canon in this Court's jurisprudence.

13

The closest, as Justice Sotomayor said, is the

14

presumption about concurrent jurisdiction, but

15

that presumption has never been held to apply

16

when a statute isn't silent.

Those are only

17

when the Congress is silent.

This is one in

18

which Congress has affirmatively taken the step

19

to remove 12 words -- to -- to remove some

20

subset of what was preexisting jurisdiction in

21

the state courts.

22

There

And, in addition, as this Court in

23

Kircher said, when you don't have a long

24

history of state court adjudication in the

25

area, presumptions about preemption don't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
80
1

apply -- indeed, presumptions about

2

preemptions, Justice Breyer, your opinion in

3

Geier says they don't apply when you have an

4

express statute that deals with preemption.

5

And I think the same analogy is true

6

here.

7

with -- you know, which deals with the amount

8

of jurisdiction.

9

could apply the presumption about concurrent

10
11

You have a specific statute that deals

So, I don't think this Court

jurisdiction.
Second, Justice Breyer, you asked

12

about the legislative history.

13

Alito, you asked who do you think -- do -- do

14

you think the person who wrote this statute set

15

out to do what you think you're saying it did?

16

And, Justice

And we're the only ones who are

17

telling you a story that is in the legislative

18

history itself.

19

conference report:

20

federal court the exclusive venue for most

21

securities class action lawsuits."

22

in the Senate, Senator D'Amato, and the chair:

23

"There shall be a uniform standard and there

24

should be a uniform procedure, and that's why

25

you move these nationally-traded securities to

The first line of the
"Title 1 of SLUSA makes

2

statement:

3

provided by this legislation state that class

4

actions generally can only be brought in

5

federal court, will be governed by federal law,

6

clarity on the federal law to be applied is

7

particularly important."

8
9

President Clinton's signing

"Since the uniform standards

There is nothing in there saying this
is only about the '34 Act.

This is my friend

10

on the other side's invention.

11

affirmatively took the step to modify the '33

12

Act jurisdictional provision, not just the '34

13

Act.

14

Congress

Justice Kennedy, this is my third

15

point, you asked about removal and whether or

16

not if you didn't accept our view of 22(a),

17

would that mean that, you know, we'd

18

effectively be out of luck.

19

shouldn't reserve that question because of the

20

reasons that my colleague from the Solicitor

21

General's Office said, and indeed it may take

22

years for another case to come up precisely

23

because there's a bar on interlocutory appeals

24

from removal decisions, as this Court in

25

Kircher made clear.

And I think you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
82

And, in addition, the Ninth Circuit in

2

a case called Rea versus Michaels Stores in

3

2014 said, when this Court, the Supreme Court,

4

makes removal available for the first time,

5

then we as litigants can go and seek that

6

removal.

7

barred us from seeking removal before, but,

8

obviously, we would do that if this Court were

9

to accept the alternative reading.

10

There's a lot of precedent which

And last and finally, ultimately you

11

are left with Justice Alito's question:

12

sense does their statutory reading make?

13

would bringing a state court count oust a

14

plaintiff out of state court when a mixed one

15

would not?

16

What
Why

And Justice Ginsburg asked why would

17

Congress, when they're so concerned about

18

procedure and things like abusive litigation

19

and serial plaintiffs and massive attorneys'

20

fees, and took all these steps to regulate that

21

in the federal court context, why would they

22

just leave the back door gaping and wide open?

23

That is not the way to read a statute.

24
25

I understand the statute is a hard one
to read, but we're the only ones giving it a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

83

reading that, A, makes sense; and that is, B,

2

consistent with the legislative history; and,
