ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN F. WESSLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WESSLER:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief

15

Justice, and may it please the Court:

16

At issue in this case is the

17

government's warrantless collection of 127 days

18

of Petitioner's cell site location information

19

revealing his locations, movements, and

20

associations over a long period.

21

As in Jones, the collection of this

22

information is a search, as it disturbs

23

people's long-standing, practical expectation

24

that their longer-term movements in public and

25

private spaces will remain private.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So what -- what is

2

the rule that you want us to adopt in this

3

case, assuming that we keep Miller -- Miller

4

and Smith versus Maryland on the books?

5

MR. WESSLER:

The rule we seek is that

6

longer-term periods or aggregations of cell

7

site location information is a search and

8

requires a warrant.

9

Court to overturn those older cases.

We are not asking the
We think

10

that the -- the lesson to be drawn from Riley

11

and Jones and Kyllo is that any extension of

12

pre-digital precedents to these kinds of

13

digital data must rest on their own bottom.

14
15
16

JUSTICE ALITO:

How would you

distinguish Miller?
MR. WESSLER:

Miller involved more

17

limited records, certainly they could reveal

18

some sensitive information, but more limited

19

records and, as this Court held, they were

20

voluntarily conveyed in that they were created

21

by the passing of negotiable instruments into

22

the stream of commerce to transfer funds.

23
24
25

What we have here is both more
sensitive and less voluntary.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is it more -- why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

is it more sensitive?

2

location information more sensitive than bank

3

records, which particularly today, when a lot

4

of people don't use cash much, if at all, a

5

bank record will disclose purchases?

6

not only disclose -- everything that the person

7

buys, it will not only disclose locations, but

8

it will disclose things that can be very

9

sensitive.

10

Why is cell site

MR. WESSLER:

It will

I absolutely agree,

11

Justice Alito, that the information in bank

12

records can be quite sensitive, but what it

13

cannot do is chart a minute-by-minute account

14

of a person's locations and movements and

15

associations over a long period regardless of

16

what the person is doing at any given moment.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, I understand

18

that.

But why is that more sensitive than bank

19

records that show, for example, periodicals to

20

which a person -- to which a person subscribes

21

or hotels where a person has stayed or

22

entertainment establishments -- establishments

23

that a person has visited -­

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And particularly -­
-- and all sorts of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

other things.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Particularly because

3

the information in the bank records that

4

Justice Alito referred to are not publicly

5

known.

6

People can see you.

7

follow you.

8

less private than -- than the case that Justice

9

Alito is discussing.

10

Your whereabouts are publicly known.
Surveillance officers can

It seems to me that this is much

MR. WESSLER:

Well, I -- I don't

11

agree, Your Honor, for the following reason:

12

When a person is engaged in a financial

13

transaction, passing a -- a check, a negotiable

14

instrument, that's an interpersonal transaction

15

where a person has full knowledge that they are

16

putting something into the stream of commerce

17

to transfer funds directed at their -- their

18

bank.

19

As the five concurring justices made

20

clear in Jones, although we may, when we step

21

outside, have a reasonable expectation that

22

someone may see where we go in a short period,

23

nobody has expected in -- in a free society

24

that our longer-term locations will be

25

aggregated and tracked in the way that they can

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
emphasizing longer term.

4
5

You keep

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, I was going to

ask about that.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now, suppose what

7

was sought here was the CSLI information for

8

the day of each robbery, just one day, the day

9

of each robbery.

Does that qualify as short

10

term in your view that would not violate the

11

Fourth Amendment?

12

MR. WESSLER:

So the -- Your Honor,

13

the -- the rule we proposed would be a single

14

24-hour period, contiguous 24-hour period.

15

Now, the only other court to address this

16

question is the -­

rule?

20

MR. WESSLER:

What

So we

21

don't think the Court needs to -- to draw a

22

bright line here, to define exactly where the

23

line between short and long term is, but as we

Mr. Wessler, could
You said 24 hours

So, if there were only one robbery,

So we can't get it for

MR. WESSLER:

So, Your -- Your Honor,

8

we've suggested 24 hours.

I think that the

9

most administrable line, if the Court wishes to

10

draw a bright line, would be a single 24-hour

11

period.

12

But this Court could -- could craft

13

other reasonable ways to -- to draw that

14

intentional line.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, now -­

Well, what -- if

17

it's reasonable for one robbery, one day, why

18

wouldn't it be reasonable -- equally reasonable

19

for each other robbery?

20

MR. WESSLER:

Well, I -- I think the

21

risk is a risk of circumvention of this Court's

22

rule from Jones and of whatever the durational

23

requirement is.

24

would be quite easy to delineate a certain set,

25

limited set, of days that -- that information

With some types of crimes, it

might be worth getting.

2

difficult.

3

Others would be more

Now, in -- in this case, it doesn't

4

matter to us, actually, where the Court draws

5

that line because 127 days of data -­

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the -- the

7

longer term is more corroborative perhaps of

8

innocence.

9

for 120 days.

That's because of where he shops

10

and so forth.

So what difference?

Suppose he's in the area every day

11

MR. WESSLER:

Well -­

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that

13

the -- the rule you're proposing might be -­

14

avoid in -- exculpatory information.

15

MR. WESSLER:

Well, Your Honor, we

16

would fully expect that if the government

17

obtained a short period of data that was -­

18

appeared to be inculpatory, that would provide

19

probable cause for a warrant to gather a much

20

wider amount of data if -- if needed, or in the

21

pretrial process, the defendant, him or

22

herself, could obtain other records from the

23

carrier and use those as exculpatory evidence.

24

Though the concern here is with the

25

privacy invasion, which is quite severe over

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

the long term, over these more than four months

2

of data.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It would help me -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I want to

5

understand the -- the basis for the 24-hour,

6

however long you want it to be, exception.

7

seems to me if there's going to be protection

8

extended to the information, it has to involve

9

some compromise of the third-party doctrine,

10

and if that is altered, I don't see why it

11

wouldn't also apply to, you know, one day of

12

information.

It

13

MR. WESSLER:

So the -- the only other

14

court to address this question is the Supreme

15

Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which drew the

16

line at six hours.

17

because we -­

18

We have suggested 24 hours

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I don't

19

understand.

20

It seems to me the line is between information

21

to which the authorities have access and

22

information to which they don't.

23

why we're bothering about a line between six

24

hours, three weeks, whatever.

25

What is the line we're drawing?

MR. WESSLER:

I don't know

Well, Your Honor,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

certainly we would be perfectly happy with a

2

rule from this Court requiring a warrant as a

3

per se matter.

4

is a -- a suggestion to the Court that takes

5

into account the rationale of the concurrences

6

in Jones and that accords with people's

7

reasonable expectation that although police

8

could have gathered a limited set or span of

9

past locations traditionally by canvassing

What we are trying to advance

10

witnesses, for example, never has the

11

government had this kind of a time machine that

12

allows them to aggregate a long period of

13

people's movements over time.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, another

15

thing the government's never had is the ability

16

to go back even for 24 hours and basically test

17

everybody, everybody in the whole community or

18

anyone who happened to be there.

19

So I don't know why that isn't a

20

consideration that cuts against preserving 24

21

hours two months ago.

22

The government didn't have the

23

capability of tracking a particular individual,

24

or every individual, and they find out later

25

that's the one they want, so I -- I don't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

understand the coherence of your argument on

2

that point.

3

MR. WESSLER:

Well, I -- I do think

4

that a different concern would be raised by the

5

-- the tower dump type situation that Justice

6

Sotomayor posited.

7

about a dragnet search, sweeping in a large

8

number of innocent people.

That might involve concerns

9

That's not the same concern, I think,

10

directly before the Court here, which involves

11

--

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But isn't that the

13

same concern here?

14

differentiating between incident-related

15

searches and basically dragnet searches when

16

you're looking at what a person is doing over

17

127, 30, 40, even 24 hours, which is it's not

18

related to any legitimate police need to invade

19

the privacy of a person over a 24-hour period,

20

unless there's a suggestion that the crime

21

occurred during that entire 24-hour period.

22

And that's why I -- I'm

So that's why I asked you is there a

23

difference between saying if police have cause

24

to believe a crime has been committed, can they

25

ask for records related to that individual

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

crime, even if it happened on one day, a second

2

day, a fourth day, a 10th day, so long as

3

they're limiting their search as related to a

4

criminal activity, as opposed to a dragnet

5

sweep of everybody's intimate details?

6

Because right now we're only talking

7

about the cell sites records, but as I

8

understand it, a cell phone can be pinged in

9

your bedroom.

It can be pinged at your

10

doctor's office.

11

intimate details of your life.

12

some point even in a dressing room as you're

13

undressing.

14

It can ping you in the most
Presumably at

So I am not beyond the belief that

15

someday a provider could turn on my cell phone

16

and listen to my conversations.

17

So I'm not sure where your 24-hour

18

rule comes from.

19

on incident-related rather than the essence of

20

your complaint, which is that we're permitting

21

police to do a dragnet search of your life?

22

Shouldn't your rule be based

MR. WESSLER:

Your Honor, first,

23

you're absolutely correct that today, in the

24

seven years that have elapsed since the data

25

was gathered in this case, network technology

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1
2

has advanced quite markedly.
And today not only is data gathered

3

for phone calls but also text messages and data

4

connections, including when a phone is in a

5

pocket passively and automatically checking for

6

new e-mails or social media messages or weather

7

alerts, and today the government is able to

8

obtain historical cell site location

9

information that can locate a person as

10
11

precisely as half the size of this courtroom.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you know, Mr.

12

Wessler, I -- I agree with you that this new

13

technology is raising very serious privacy

14

concerns, but I need to know how much of

15

existing precedent you want us to overrule or

16

declare obsolete.

17

And if I could, I'd just like to take

18

you back briefly to -- to Miller and ask on

19

what grounds that can be distinguished.

20

don't say we should overrule it, and you had -­

21

you said the information here is more

22

sensitive.

23

about that.

24
25

You

We maybe could agree to disagree
I don't know.

But what else?

What -- on what other

ground can Miller possibly be distinguished?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

MR. WESSLER:

So both Miller and Smith

2

identified at least two factors to take into

3

account in the reasonable expectation of

4

privacy analysis:

5

their sensitivity and whether they're

6

voluntarily conveyed.

7

the nature of the records or

And I think here there is also a great

8

distinction on voluntariness.

9

negotiable instrument passed into commerce or,

10

for that matter, a phone number punched into a

11

touch tone phone, people when they make or

12

receive a phone call, receive a text message,

13

and certainly when their phone is automatically

14

making a data connection, do not provide their

15

location information to the carrier.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Unlike a

Well, I mean, that's a

17

debatable empirical point whether people

18

realize what's -- what's going on, and there's

19

reason to think maybe they do.

20

I mean, people know, there -- there

21

were all these commercials, "can you hear me

22

now," our company has lots of towers

23

everywhere.

24
25

What do they think that's about?

The contract, the standard MetroPCS
contract seems to say -- and I guess we don't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

have the actual contract in the record here -­

2

does seem to say that -- advise the customer

3

that we can disclose this information to the -­

4

to the government if we get a court order.

5

So I don't know whether that will hold

6

up.

And even if it were to hold up today, what

7

will happen in the future if people -­

8

everybody begins to realize that this is -­

9

this is provided?

If you have enough police TV

10

shows where this is shown, then everybody will

11

know about it, just like they know about CSI

12

information.

13

MR. WESSLER:

Three points, Your

14

Honor.

15

amicus brief at pages 3 through 4, they run

16

through a result of a survey that I think quite

17

strongly shows that a strong majority of

18

Americans do not understand that this

19

information is even accessible to, much less

20

retained by the service providers.

21

First, in the empirical scholars'

Second, I agree that the MetroPCS

22

contract in -- in effect in 2010 and the other

23

company's privacy policies today do disclose

24

that location information can be obtained, but

25

I actually think the disclosures more broadly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

in those documents accrue to our favor.

2

I'll explain why that is in one

3

moment, although I -- I think I should caution

4

the Court that -- that relying too heavily on

5

those contractual documents in either direction

6

here would, to -- to paraphrase the Court in

7

Smith, threaten to make a crazy quilt of the

8

Fourth Amendment because we may end up with a,

9

you know, hinging constitutional protections on

10

the happenstance of companies' policies.

11

those -- those contractual documents to a

12

company restate and contractualize the

13

protections of the Telecommunications Act and

14

quite strongly promise people that their

15

information will remain private without

16

consent.

17

And lastly -­

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19
20

But

Except as provided by

law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As to -- as to

21

other -- as to other private persons, not as to

22

the government.

23

MR. WESSLER:

That's right.

There -­

24

there's a provision to disclose, as required by

25

law, those four words need to be read in -- in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

context and in compliance with the

2

Constitution.

3

reasonable expectation of privacy in these

4

records, then a warrant is required.

5

So if -- if there is a

But even looking at the statutory

6

framework itself, the government points to the

7

Stored Communications Act as the -- the law

8

requiring disclosure.

9

amended that statute in 1994, it provided two

But when Congress

10

mechanisms for access to records:

11

order, as used here, and a warrant under

12

Section 2703(c)(1)(A).

13

a 2703(d)

And I think a person looking at that

14

statute would be quite reasonable and right to

15

assume that the reason there's a warrant prong

16

is to deal with records like these in which

17

there's a strong privacy interest.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But your argument,

19

as I understood it from the brief and I'm

20

hearing it today, makes the Stored

21

Communications Act and the 20 -- is it 2703(d)

22

order irrelevant.

23

it.

24
25

You don't even talk about

In an area where we're searching for a
compromise, where it's difficult to draw a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

20

line, why shouldn't we give very significant

2

weight to the Congress's determination that

3

there should be and will be some judicial

4

supervision over this -- over -- over these

5

investigations?

6

MR. WESSLER:

Justice Kennedy,

7

Congress enacted the Stored Communications Act

8

in 1986 and amended it in relevant part in

9

1994.

Three-tenths of 1 percent of Americans

10

had cell phones in 1986, only 9 percent in

11

1994.

12
13

There were about 18,000 cell towers in
1994.

Today there are over 300,000.

14

And -­

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you mean -­

16

you mean the Act was more necessary when there

17

were fewer cell phones?

No, not -- not -­
It seems to me just

the opposite.
MR. WESSLER:

Not at all, Your Honor.

22

My point is that Congress quite clearly was not

23

thinking about the existence of, and certainly

24

not law enforcement interest in, historical

25

cell site location information.

There is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21

nothing in the historical legislative record

2

for -- for the members of the Court who would

3

look there to indicate any cognizance of these

4

kinds of records.

5

So -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, again, my

6

question is, you give zero weight in your

7

arguments to the fact that there is some

8

protection?

9

MR. WESSLER:

Your Honor, we

10

acknowledge fully that there is some

11

protection, a touch more than a traditional

12

subpoena because a judge is involved, but we

13

think it is insufficient in the context of

14

records held by a third-party in which the

15

subject of the investigation -­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And yet you said, I

17

think you said in your brief, that in most of

18

the cases where you get one of these 2703(d)

19

orders, in the mine run of cases, you said

20

there was probably enough there to get a

21

warrant.

22

confessed robber identifies his collaborators

23

and there are details about the collaborator.

24

Why isn't that enough to get a warrant?

25

So let's take this very case:

MR. WESSLER:

A

In this case, it -- it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

is quite possible that the government could

2

3

4

for the court order.

5

mentioned only once in a conclusory sentence at

6

the end.

7

at that point, a cooperating co-defendant.

8

I -- I can't say whether, had they wanted to,

9

they could have made out probable cause.

10
11

Now, I -- I don't think they stated

Mr. Carpenter's name is

They did have a cooperating witness
And

It's

entirely possible.
I -- I want to return, Justice Alito,

12

to your question because I think it's important

13

to -- to remember that Miller and Smith were

14

decided four decades ago.

15

have -- have imagined the technological

16

landscape today.

17

government's invitation to -- to, in my view,

18

radically extend those cases would place beyond

19

the protection of the Fourth Amendment not only

20

those locations records -­

21

The Court could not

And accepting the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are we -- are we

22

radically extending them?

From the very

23

beginning, Smith, for example, basically said

24

the disclosure at issue doesn't disclose the

25

content of the conversation.

As the dissent

Heritage Reporting Corporation

pointed out, the provider had access to the -­

2

to the content of the conversation.

3

Yet, we drew a line in saying cell

phone numbers -- telephone numbers are

5

disclosable because everybody knows that the

6

telephone company is keeping track of those

7

numbers.

8

end of each month.

9

You get it in your phone bill at the

But we said people don't know or even

10

if they realize that the phone company can

11

listen in to their conversation, that there's a

12

reasonable expectation that the phone company

13

won't, absent some urgent circumstance, a death

14

threat, almost a special needs circumstance.

15

That suggests, as you started to say

16

earlier, that it never was an absolute rule,

17

the third-party doctrine.

18

when -- in Bond and Ferguson when we said

19

police can't get your medical records without

20

your consent, even though you've disclosed your

21

medical records to doctors at a hospital.

22

We limited it

They can't touch your bag to feel

23

what's in your bag because an individual may

24

disclose his or her bag to the public.

25

one of my colleagues here said you can -- why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I think

Official
24
1

shouldn't people expect others to touch their

2

bag as well?

3

because you expose what your bag looks like,

4

but you don't have an expectation that people

5

are going to touch your bag.

6

Well, and the Court said no

So is it really that far off to say,

7

yes, I can believe that my location at one

8

moment or other moments might be searched by

9

police, but I don't expect them to track me

10
11

down for 24 hours over 127 days?
MR. WESSLER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

12

We agree that the contents of electronic

13

communications should be protected, as I think

14

the government agrees in its -- its brief.

15

in the digital age, content as a category is

16

both under-inclusive and unadministrable.

9

you -- you -- that the information that's

Because the government

10

gleaned from this is -- is very -- it's sort of

11

general, it's vague, it doesn't pinpoint

12

exactly where you are, and in order to make

13

effective use of it, it has to be combined with

14

many other pieces of information.

15

And, you know -- you know, A, do you

16

agree with that, but, B, what is your view of

17

-- of the relevance of the fact that

18

information may not be useful in itself but may

19

be useful in combination with other

20

information?

21

Does that make a difference?

MR. WESSLER:

Justice Kagan, so on the

22

first point, we agree that, as of 2010 and 2011

23

where the records in this case come from, they

24

were generally less precise than the GPS data

25

in Jones, but we don't think that that makes a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

difference for the Fourth Amendment rule for a

2

few reasons.

3

First, to go to the second part of

4

your -- your question, even in Jones, the data

5

lacked precision.

6

within 50 to 100 feet and only tracked where a

broadcast radius as small as 10 meters, about

19

half the size of this -- this courtroom, the

20

ability now of providers to estimate the actual

21

location of the phone based on the time and

22

angle that the signal from the phone reaches

23

the towers, and the just skyrocketing amount of

24

data usage by normal smartphone users means

25

that even the large traditional cell towers are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

much closer together in urban and dense

2

suburban areas, so the distance between them is

3

less, so they are significantly -- the location

4

information is more precise.

5

It's also more voluminous because now

6

data connections create location information.

7

And so the -- the 101 data points per day on

8

average in this case pale in comparison to what

9

--

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Just, Mr. -- Mr.

11

Wessler, along those lines, one more kind of

12

technical question.

13

the briefs that some of this information is

14

required to be kept by governmental regulation,

15

the E911 program.

16

that for us?

17

There was a suggestion in

Do you have any insight on

MR. WESSLER:

Yeah, there's no -­

18

there's no direct requirement that these

19

location records be kept.

20

that the -- the capability of the cell

21

companies to track cell phones in real-time is

22

a government mandate as part of the E911

23

system.

24
25

Now, what is true is

That is -- that capability is related
to the -- the capability that is relatively

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

newer to estimate the actual location of the

2

phone based on time and angle of the signal,

3

historically, coming in.

13

financing terrorism, we could go through the

14

list, large numbers of cases, of important

They do have reasonable ground to think.

they start with bank records, with all kinds of

right line?

perhaps back before Your Honors, it would be

relatively straightforward to define discrete

I think perhaps certain other types of

perhaps what room they're in, communicative

contents, not only the contents of e-mails but

Miller and Smith to highly sensitive digital

10

age records.
And as to these historical location

12

records, the five courts of appeals to address

13

this have generated 20 majority concurring and

14

dissenting opinions, many of them virtually

15

begging this Court to provide guidance for how

16

to protect these sensitive digital records that

17

the Court simply could not have imagined four

18

decades ago.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A lot of what

20

you're talking about and a lot of what the

21

questions concern, I think, is addressed under

22

the question whether a warrant should issue as

23

opposed to whether a warrant is required.

24
25

Under current practice, when you're
getting a warrant, it makes a difference if you

2

for anything I can find and if you say I want

15

MR. WESSLER:

Your Honor, we certainly

16

think that the -- the probable cause and

17

particularity requirements of a warrant will -­

18

will do a lot of work to -- to focus

19

investigations.

20

In an investigation like this, perhaps

21

127 days or 152, as the original request was,

22

would not all be appropriate.

the robberies would actually be particularly

relevant to the probable cause determination.

Maybe under a

2

that a warrant is required in this context

3

because it's unlike the other subpoena cases

two factors that weigh on -- on the

Can you tell me

19

what is the difference between the 2703(d)

20

order and a warrant?

21

you could get the order but not a warrant?

22

What are situations where

MR. WESSLER:

So the -- the standard

23

for issuance of the order is lower.

Some lower

24

courts have -- have likened it to a reasonable

25

suspicion standard.

I think it's probably a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38

touch above pure reasonableness, but it's

2

certainly short of probable cause.

It also lacks a requirement for a

prosecutor.

I think that there are a zillion different ways

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Dreeben, why

is it not okay, in the way we said about

that most young people have the phones in the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right?

If it's not okay to put a beeper into

MR. DREEBEN:

will answer the question about cell phone

that the Court understand that this case

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. DREEBEN:

But we

No, I think -­

-- it's -- it's very

23

different from it.

The expectations of privacy

about the contents of a one-to-one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

are quite different.

bedrock understanding that a letter mailed

through the mail, the routing information is

available to the government, the address of

They grow out of the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yeah, but -- but

7

8

You can -- you can yourself control the public

disclosure.

10

But with telephones, the telephone

11

company could have plugged in and listened to

12

your conversation just as easily as these

13

telecommunications companies can read your

e-mails if they choose.

15

would protect e-mail content.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Yet, we've said we

That is true.

And I

17

think that that is because there is a different

18

between content and routing information that

19

the Court recognized in Smith itself.

20

We're dealing here with routing

21

information.

We're not dealing with the

22

contents of communications.

23

that Katz makes clear that incidental access of

24

a provider to the contents of a communication

25

when the -- when the provider is functioning as

I agree with you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46

an intermediary doesn't vitiate Fourth

2

Amendment protection.

3

We're not here to argue that it does.

4

We're here to argue that routing information of

5

the sort that was available in Smith and the

6

sort that's available here functions as a

7

business record because the business is using

8

it in its transaction with the customer to

9

route the calls.

10

The content information is being

11

provided through a provider as an intermediary

12

so that somebody can communicate with another

13

person.

14

And -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dreeben, how is

15

this different from Jones?

You know, in Jones,

16

there were a couple of different opinions, but

17

five justices, as -- as I count it, said

18

this -- this is from Justice Alito's opinion:

19

"Society's expectation has been that law

20

enforcement and others would not, and indeed in

21

the main simply cannot, monitor and catalogue

22

every single movement of an individual's" -­

23

there it was a car -- "for a long period."

24

So how is it different from that?

25

MR. DREEBEN:

I think it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

fundamentally different, Justice Kagan, because

2

this involves acquiring the business records of

3

a provider which has determined to keep these

4

records of the cell site information.

5

Jones involved government

6

surveillance.

It involved attaching a GPS

7

device to the car.

8

regarded that as a trespatory search.

9

other members of the Court were prepared to

Five members of the Court
Five

10

analyze that under reasonable expectations of

11

privacy.

12

surveillance of the suspect in the crime.

13

But in both cases, it was direct

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So the question is why

14

that should make more of a difference than the

15

obvious similarity between this case and Jones?

16

And the obvious similarity is that, in both

17

cases, you have reliance on a new technology

18

that allows for 24/7 tracking.

19

Now, you're exactly right, there were

20

different means, but in both cases, you have a

21

new technology that allows for 24/7 tracking

22

and a conclusion by a number of justices in

23

Jones that that was an altogether new and

24

different thing that did intrude on people's

25

expectations of who would be watching them

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

when.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

So the -- the people who

3

are watching in this case are the phone

4

companies because people have decided to sign

5

up for cellular service in which it is a

6

necessity of the service that your phone

7

communicate with a tower and a business record

8

is generated.

9

People who dial phone numbers on calls

10

know that they're being routed through a cell

11

phone or a landline provider.

12

can be made available to the government.

13

could be made available for quite extensive

14

periods of time.

15

Those records
They

I think in many ways it's far more

revealing to know who a person is calling than

21

The cell site information

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Dreeben, what

22

do you do with the survey mentioned by your

23

opposing colleague that says that most

24

Americans, I still think, want to avoid Big

25

Brother.

They want to avoid the concept that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

government will be able to see and locate you

2

anywhere you are at any point in time.

3

Is it -- do you really believe that

4

people expect that the government will be able

5

to do that without probable cause and a

6

warrant?

7

MR. DREEBEN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

I don't -­
The -- the

Constitution protects the rights of people to

10

be secure.

11

don't you think, that that would include the

12

government searching for information about your

13

location every second of the day -­

14
15

MR. DREEBEN:

So, in instances like

this, Justice Sotomayor -­

16
17

Isn't it a fundamental concept,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- for months and

months at a time?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

-- involving rapidly

19

changing technology and privacy expectations

20

that are being measured here by surveys, the

21

proper body to address that is Congress.

22

And Congress has been active in this

23

area.

24

failure -­

25

This is not an instance of political

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the question

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

is, was it -- the fact that Congress recognized

2

how sensitive this information is, is quite

3

laudatory, but did it understand the measure of

4

the constitutional requirement of what

5

protections should be given to that?

6

I mean, I -- I can defer to Congress's

7

understanding of the privacy needs, but does

8

that create an obligation for me to defer to

9

their judgment of what protections the

10
11

Constitution requires?
The Constitution has always said

12

government can't intrude, except in some

13

carefully defined situation, special needs

14

being foremost among them -- can't intrude on

15

those privacy interests without a warrant.

16

We're not saying they can't ever.

17

got to have articulable facts based on reliable

18

information, sworn to in an affidavit, that can

19

provide probable cause to believe that this

20

individual is involved in criminal activity.

21

That's not a new standard.

22
23

They've just

That's an

old standard.
MR. DREEBEN:

But the new standard

24

here would be saying that the business records

25

of a third party, when acquired by the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

government, constitute a -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But we have -­

-- search of -­

6

Ferguson, Bond, even in creating Smith and

7

Miller, we created an exception.

9

third parties.

People

But we said the government

10

can't intrude without a warrant in that

11

situation.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

I think there was a

13

well-developed framework at the time of Smith

14

and Miller that the Court applied to Smith and

15

Miller.

16

if you communicate information to a third

17

person, the public has an interest in that

18

person's witnessing of what they heard or what

19

they said, and it can acquire it through means

20

short of a warrant.

21

And it basically says, in our society,

That was the basic framework that led

22

the Court in Katz to conclude that what you

23

maintain privately in your house or in the

24

content of your phone calls requires special

25

process.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Dreeben, I'd

2

like to -- I'd like to drill down on that and

3

return to Justice Kagan's question.

4

the facts here wind up looking a lot like

5

Jones.

6

You know,

One thing Jones -- Jones taught us is

7

-- and reminded us, really, is that the

8

property-based approach to privacy also has to

9

be considered, not just the reasonable

10

expectation approach.

11

So, if we put aside the reasonable

12

expectation approach for just a moment, Katz,

13

Miller, Smith, and ask what is the property

14

right here, let's say there is a property

15

right.

16

the conversion case I posited with your

17

colleague, so that if someone were to steal my

18

location information from T-Mobile I'd have a

19

conversion claim, for example, against them for

20

the economic value that was stolen.

Let's say I have a property right in

Wouldn't that, therefore, be a search

22

of my paper or effect under the property-based

23

approach approved and reminded us in Jones?

are insisting that I acknowledge that it's a

it is a property right.

Justice Gorsuch, I think

that the problem with the hypothetical is that

11

it creates a property interest -­

All right.

-- out of transfers of

information.

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Please -- please,

16

could you stick with my hypothetical and then

17

you can tell me why it's wrong.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

All right.
Under my

20

hypothetical, you have a property right in this

21

information.

22
23
24
25

Would it be a search of my paper and
effect?

Yes or no.
MR. DREEBEN:

I am not sure.

And the

reason that I am not sure is there has never

Heritage Reporting Corporation

been a property right recognized in information

2

that's conveyed to a business of this

3

character.

4

If we were talking about e-mail, as

5

Your Honor's opinion in Ackerman sought to

6

analogize to property, I think we would have a

7

more complex discussion about it.

8

that it would achieve any different result.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm not sure

You're not here to

10

deny that there might be a property interest

11

and, therefore, a search?

would be a search of my paper and effect?

it either.

can't prevent the company from destroying it.

And according to Petitioner, the

customer doesn't even have a right to get the

MR. DREEBEN:

So, Justice Alito, those

17

are a lot of good reasons on why this should

not be recognized as a property interest.

19

can't think of anything that would be

20

characterized as a property interest with those

traits.

watershed change in the law to treat

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Dreeben -­

-- why -- why -- why

12

couldn't Congress also say you don't get an

13

Article III judge to determine this issue?

14

MR. DREEBEN:

That seems so

15

non-germane to what Congress was trying to do.

16

In Section 222, what Congress was trying to do

17

was to say, look, the -- the companies are

18

collecting a large amount of information.

19

We recognize that there are privacy

20

We want to give recognition

JUSTICE ALITO:

We do not want to
So the

Yeah, Mr. Dreeben, I

would read the -- the -- the phrase "customer

proprietary information" to mean that it is

2

proprietary to the cell phone company and,

3

therefore, not to the customer.

4

information, but it's proprietary information

5

about the cell phone company because, if you

6

got that information in the aggregate, you

7

could tell a lot about the company's operation.

8
9

It's customer

I assume that -- that that kind of
information would be available to the FCC.

And

10

so, if the FCC obtained it, they would have to

11

treat it as proprietary information of the

12

company.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Alito -­
Am I wrong in that?
I am not sure that that

16

is the way that Congress intended it, but I

17

think that what is significant is not the label

18

but what actual underlying rights were created.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if it were

20

proprietary to the customer, in what sense is

21

it proprietary to the customer, since it has

22

all of those attributes that I mentioned?

23

MR. DREEBEN:

That's precisely my

24

point.

As a label to indicate that Congress

25

wanted to show some respect for privacy

Heritage Reporting Corporation

interests, when people interact with

2

telecommunications companies, it provided

3

certain nondisclosure rules.

4

It also made clear that it -­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could the

6

government say to telecommunications providers,

7

you cannot use this kind of information, you

8

can't keep it?

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, I'm sure that in

10

regulating that telephone companies are given a

11

broad range -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's the

13

difference between that and saying, if you want

14

to create this information, you are taking this

15

information from customers and it's the

16

customer's information?

17

without the customer saying yea or nay.

You can't disclose it

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't what that

Congress did?

No, because Congress

Justice Gorsuch's question, which is:

require in those circumstances?

saying Congress can set the level of what the

that's true.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think it's

11

definitely not true.

12

of the Fourth Amendment, but it has already

13

decided that question.

14

This Court is the arbiter

It has decided two things:

One, under

15

the third-party doctrine, business information

16

that is obtained from a company in the ordinary

17

course of its business -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. DREEBEN:

-- is not a search of

the customer.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's begging

22

the question.

23

information when Congress says it's customer

24

information?

25

Is it the third-party's

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Congress can say a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

lot of things, and I think that the important

2

thing that this Court has said as a corollary

3

to my point about what the third-party doctrine

4

is, is the Court has made clear that state laws

5

that provide additional enhanced privacy

6

protection do not alter Fourth Amendment

7

baselines.

8
9

It said that in Greenwood.
that in Moore.

It said

It said it most recently in

10

Quon, where it confronted a claim that the

11

Stored Communications Act, the same law that's

12

at issue here, created some sort of an

13

expectation of privacy above and beyond what

14

the Fourth Amendment required, and the Court

15

said:

16

about privacy expectations in text messaging by

17

what Congress has provided in the context of

18

the Stored Communications Act.

We don't measure Fourth Amendment rules

19

And I think it, in fact, illustrates

20

that Congress's efforts to provide enhanced

21

protection above and beyond what the Fourth

22

Amendment requires do not alter the content of

23

the Fourth Amendment.

Justice Breyer.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

I just want your

4

reaction to what I asked the other side.

I

5

agree with you that the law is at the moment

6

third-party information is third-party, with a

7

few exceptions, but it may be that here another

8

exception should exist for the reason that the

9

technology, since the time those cases have -­

10

has changed dramatically to the point where you

11

get the cell phone information, the tower

12

information, and put it together in a way that

13

tracks a person's movement for 274 days or

14

whatever, is an unreasonable thing for the

15

government to do.

16

Assume that's so.

Now, one thing that is bothering me

about that line is what I said before.

like your reaction as to how to draw such a

line, if we draw it.

when faced with reason to believe that there

are securities violations, white-collar crime

violations, terrorism financing violations, all

kinds of things like that, that they do go to

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why not just

8

say what he said on the other side?

9

wrong with that?

Say what's

What we say is, look, what we

10

have here is many, many days of the government

11

taking previously unavailable tower information

12

at the time of Miller, et cetera, now putting

13

it together in order to track where this human

14

being has been for a long period of time,

15

something that never could have been gotten

16

before, and to do that without some probable

17

cause is an unreasonable thing.

18

with that as an exception welded onto the basic

19

rule?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

What's wrong

It doesn't have a

21

coherent principle that will explain why a

similar rule shouldn't be applied to credit

similar things in similar circumstances of

highly private information, you draw, you know,

12

several -- you draw several factors there and

13

-- and you have it over here, if you had the

14

similar thing, all those factors are met in

15

these other cases, so be it.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

So, Justice Breyer,

17

there is a significant difference between the

18

kinds of cases you're talking about involving

19

direct governmental searching activity and

20

governmental acquisition of information from

21

businesses.

22

The government is not monitoring the

23

movements of this person by attaching a device

24

to their person or by surveilling them, an

25

issue that I think itself raises difficult

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1

questions since it does not appear that

2

Petitioner objects to tailing somebody in

3

multiple cars, even over 127 days.

4

What we're talking about here is the

5

distinction between the government going and

6

getting information from an individual and the

7

government going to a business and asking the

8

business to serve as a witness.

9

And I think Your Honor's point about

10

how investigations proceed is exactly right.

11

What the government does at the early stages of

12

an investigation is reach out to third parties

13

because it may not have enough information

14

about whether a crime has been committed or

15

whether a particular individual is culpable for

16

that crime.

17

who have information that allows them to narrow

18

the field, to find out what's going on.

19

It goes to third-party providers

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If -- if there -- if

20

there's a shooting into a house, someone is

21

killed, and witnesses say the shooter was

22

running away with a cell phone, and the police

23

ask the company to release all information

24

about cell phones in that area, you don't have

25

to go to the -- to get a 2703(d) order?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MR. DREEBEN:

-- a blanket search?

Well, for -- I think

8

what Justice Sotomayor described earlier is

9

getting tower information.

We used exactly

10

that technique when a bullet was fired through

11

the window of a federal judge -­

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Right.

-- in Florida, and the

14

government did not have a clear idea of who the

15

suspects would be.

16

the field by figuring out -­

17
18
19

It attempted to narrow down

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you did need an

order?
MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, we did need an

20

order and we got an order.

And I think this is

21

another answer to your concern, Justice Breyer.

22

Not only are we going to less sensitive sources

23

of information at the early stages of an

24

investigation to gather information and figure

25

out what the criminal activity is and who might

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71
1

be inculpated in it, but we also are operating

2

under a statutory regime that requires us to

3

make a particularized showing.

It's not the case that we can just
walk in and get -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

But, Mr.

7

Dreeben, that could go away tomorrow.

The

8

question here is the constitutional question,

9

not the statutory one.

So can I take you back

10

to what, it seems to me, is the essential

11

identity between the factual circumstances here

12

and in Jones, which is that the government is

13

getting 24/7 information.

14

I mean, in some ways, you could say

15

this is more.

Jones was just about a car; this

16

is about every place that you are, whether

17

you're in a car or not.

18

that what makes it different is that you've

19

given the information to another person.

20

recall that when you were here in the Jones

21

case, your theory for why that was permissible

22

was essentially that you had given that

23

information to the entire public; in other

24

words, just by being in the world, everybody

25

sees you, everybody watches you, and you've

And you said to me

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But I

Official
72
1

lost your expectation of privacy in that way.

2

Now, we pretty conclusively rejected

3

that argument.

4

giving it to one person, the same information,

5

this 24/7 tracking, than we said it was when

6

you give it to the entire world?

7

Why is it different when it's

MR. DREEBEN:

So I -- I think that it

8

is fundamentally different in the means that we

9

chose to employ in Jones versus this case, and

10

it's also different in what information we're

11

acquiring.

12

24/7 tracking of the precise movements of an

13

individual everywhere he went.

19

and better, more and more precise, it's not 10

Heritage Reporting Corporation

73

MR. DREEBEN:

So I would say that the

2

third-party doctrine doesn't change.

3

think that this Court could disagree and draw a

4

line on more precise information that involves

5

24/7 tracking.

6

I also

This information is just simply far

7

more similar to what was going on in the Smith

8

case, where we got dialed phone numbers that

9

would reveal a much more precise location where

10

the dialed phone number came from and the

11

person that was being spoken to.

12

with the opportunity to decide the kind of

14

granularity that Petitioner posits may happen

15

in the future.

24

highly questionable under the Constitution, and

here's why:

Providers, which are hardly shy

Heritage Reporting Corporation

about asserting Fourth Amendment rights, have

2

protections against unduly broad subpoenas that

summarized in our -- in our brief.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

MR. DREEBEN:

There has to be a

9

showing of relevance.

showing of congressional authorization.

11

has to be a showing of specificity.

12

cannot be unduly broad so as to be unduly

13

burdensome.

And it

So the -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, all

15

those protections are available in the

16

magistrate's decision whether to issue the

17

warrant, right?

18

I -- I mean, you can -­

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

But -- but we -­

19

we have to demand this information somehow.

20

we assume that the statute went away, which for

21

reasons that I'd like to come back to, I think

22

the Court could decide the case based on the

23

statute's compliance with the Constitution,

24

even if you assume that there's a privacy

25

interest at stake, but if there's no statute

Heritage Reporting Corporation

If

Official
75
1

and we're going just under a subpoena, there is

2

a long-standing recognition in this Court's

3

cases that unduly broad subpoenas are subject

4

to being squashed -- quashed under Fourth

5

Amendment principles.

6

And the principles that are considered

7

in that context are raised by the provider.

8

They can include the sensitivity of the

9

information.

This Court, in Footnote 6 of the

10

Miller decision, expressly said:

11

understand there's a lot of sensitive banking

12

information that's going on here.

13

other protections besides abolishing the

14

third-party doctrine.

15

Amendment and they include objections to the

16

overbreadth of a request.

17

Look, we

There are

They include the First

So, in response to your question,

18

could the government just walk in with a

19

subpoena and get a lifetime of this

20

information, no, I don't think that we could,

21

and I do not think that we would.

22

We are still limited by basic Fourth

23

Amendment principles that apply even to

24

subpoenas where there's not additional

25

statutory protection.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, yeah, Mr.

2

Dreeben, in order to understand the issue here

3

and to see the difference between this case and

4

Jones, isn't it necessary to go back to old

5

Supreme Court cases that describe -- that

6

explain how the Fourth Amendment applies to a

7

subpoena?

8
9

Asking another -- asking a party or
ordering a party to produce documents is not a

10

search in the literal sense of the word, nor is

11

it a seizure in the literal sense of the word,

12

but cases going back to Boyd, and Hale versus

13

Henkel, old cases say that it's a -- it's a

14

constructive search.

15

where there's this constructive search, then

16

the Fourth Amendment standards that apply to a

17

literal search, what the Court called an actual

18

search, are different.

19

fundamentally -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

framework.

24

different framework because of both a lesser

degree of intrusion, because the government is

for pre-compliance judicial review.

And I would submit that if the Court

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, but if -­

11

you're saying, you're basically saying, well,

12

because the government is going to a

13

third-party here and doing it by subpoena, it

14

doesn't matter how sensitive the information

15

is.

16

lack of voluntariness on the individual's part

17

in terms of conveying that information to the

18

third-party.

19

It doesn't matter whether there's really a

And we could go on and we could give,

20

you know, other factors that you might think in

21

a sensible world would matter to this question.

22

And you're saying that all of that is trumped

by the fact that the government is doing this

24

by subpoena, rather than by setting up its own

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think I did say

2

that, Justice Kagan, because there is an

3

element here of voluntariness in deciding to

4

contract with a cell company, just like there's

5

an element of voluntariness in getting a

landline phone and making calls, and there's an

element of voluntariness in signing up for a

Yes, it was a search.

The

Mr. Dreeben, it

seems like your whole argument boils down to if

22

we get it from a third-party we're okay,

23

regardless of property interest, regardless of

24

anything else.

25

original understanding of the Constitution and

But how does that fit with the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

writs of assistance?

2

You know, John Adams said one of the

3

reasons for the war was the -- the use by the

4

government of third parties to obtain

5

information -- force them to help as their

6

snitches and snoops.

7

argument exactly what the framers were

8

concerned about?

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Why -- why isn't this

Well, I think that those

10

-- those were writs that allowed people acting

11

under governmental power to enter any place

12

they wanted to search for anything that they

13

wanted.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Isn't that exactly

15

your argument here, that so long as a third

16

party's involved, we can get anything we want?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think the search

18

is being carried out under a writ of assistance

19

by a government agent, operating under

20

government authority; whereas here, we -- the

21

-- if there's a search in the acquisition of

-- anything that any

company has anywhere in the globe regardless of

any property rights, regardless of any privacy

16

interests, simply because it's a third-party?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

So I -- I think that, as

18

Justice Alito was explaining, there is a

19

traditional understanding that dates back to

20

the time of the founding that subpoenas stand

21

on a different footing from search warrants.

22

And they do that because they are less

23

intrusive, since they do not require the

24

government going into private property and

25

searching itself.

14

The whole question is whether

MR. DREEBEN:

So I -- I think most

15

basically it makes a difference because this

16

Court's cases have said so from time

17

immemorial.

18

is that if I go into your house to search, I

19

will expose a great deal of additional

20

information to government view beyond what is

21

sought by the terms of an authorization.

22
23

And the reason why it has said so

And so, if I could just complete the
answer.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Sure.

The -- the difference

Heritage Reporting Corporation

here is that the government is operating under

2

court supervision with an order that provides

3

particularity.

4

of a neutral magistrate between the government

and the acquisition of information.

6

does require a showing that is less than

7

probable cause but is above what a traditional

subpoena requires.

9

It provides the interposition

And it

So even if the Court does think that

10

there is a search here, Congress has properly,

11

in our view, calibrated the balancing of

12

interests, and the Court should affirm it as a

13

constitutionally reasonable order.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN F. WESSLER

18

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

19
20
21

Thank you,

MR. WESSLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
If I could begin, I have several

22

points, but to begin on that subpoena point.

23

And, Justice Alito, to -- to your question

24

about the historical pedigree of the subpoena

25

doctrine, I think this Court made absolutely

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
87
1

clear in Riley that the historical pedigree of

2

older Fourth Amendment doctrines does not

3

automatically determine the outcome in the

4

digital age.

5

And as you yourself, Your Honor,

6

recognized in your concurrence there, the

7

search incident to arrest doctrine had its

8

origins at least a century before the -- the

9

framing of the Fourth Amendment, and yet it

10

yielded to a new understanding.

11

And I think that -­

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's certainly true,

13

but you'd want to -- so this is -- this would

14

be revolutionary, to fundamentally change the

15

understanding of the application of the Fourth

16

Amendment to subpoenas.

17

that?

18

MR. WESSLER:

Do you want us to do

Well, I -- I don't think

19

it's revolutionary at all.

And I think the

20

reason that is, is the government's concession,

21

as I hear it, that the contents of electronic

22

communications should be protected.

23

Once we recognized that there is an

24

exception for the contents of e-mails, we've

25

already acknowledged that the subpoena doctrine

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
88
1

can't stand in its most severe form.

And if -­

2

if the contents of e-mails are to be protected,

3

it's not because they are sealed in transit,

4

as, Justice Sotomayor, you pointed out.

5

They're unlike, in a fundamental way,

6

the paper letters at issue in 1877 in Ex Parte

7

Jackson.

8

accessed by the service providers, as the

9

government has argued in other cases, including

They are actually accessible to and

10

the Microsoft case to be heard later this -­

11

this term.

12

So, if they're to be protected, it's

13

because of their sensitivity and because of

14

people's long-standing expectation that their

15

communications are highly sensitive and would

16

remain private.

17

And as the concurrences at least

18

recognized in Jones, also highly private and

19

sensitive are these kinds of longer-term

20

location records.

21

Second, I -- I just want to highlight

22

that the -- the government, Mr. Dreeben, as I

23

heard him, conceded that the precision of these

24

records doesn't matter at all to the

25

government's theory here.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
89

They could be precise, I take it, to

2

within a single inch.

3

third party has custody of them would, in the

4

government's view, vitiate any expectation of

5

privacy, which we think would be a very

6

destructive rule.

7

And the fact that a

Third, this is not an area where the

8

4

but you said in your brief that the -- that the

5

companies wouldn't comply.

6

MR. WESSLER:

That I -- I don't know

7

what the state of -- of play is today.

8

few years ago, the last time I have

9

information, they were not complying.

As of a

But -­

10

but under Fourth Amendment property principles

11

and property law more generally, it's of course

12

quite common for a property right to be divided

13

between different -- different parties, for the

14

bundle of sticks to be split up.

15

people have a right to exclude and a right to

16

determine use of the data secured by the

17

Telecommunications Act.

18

And here

Certainly, we acknowledge that the -­

19

the provider itself has some property right,

20

maybe several of those sticks in the bundle,

21

but that doesn't eliminate some right on -- on

22

the part of -- of -- of the customer.

we ask that you reverse the Sixth Circuit.

Communications Act provides two mechanisms, an

order and a warrant.
