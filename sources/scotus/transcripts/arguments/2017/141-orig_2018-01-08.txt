ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL

9

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

10
11

MS. O'CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

The Rio Grande Compact is an unusual

13

interstate compact in that it does not require

14

New Mexico to deliver water to the Texas state

15

line.

16

1939, it incorporated and relied upon an

17

existing Bureau of Reclamation project as part

18

of the equitable apportionment framework.

19

Instead, when the compact was adopted in

Because Reclamation controls releases

20

from the Project for delivery to contract

21

holders below the reservoir and in Mexico, the

22

State of New Mexico asserted that this case

23

could not go forward without the United States'

24

participation as a party to be bound by this

25

Court's decree.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

To permit a full resolution of the

2

dispute, the United States intervened as a

3

plaintiff, filed a complaint that presented the

4

federal government's interests that are at

5

stake in this dispute, and explained how

6

injunctive relief against New Mexico could be

7

shaped to protect those interests.

8

In its complaint, the United States

9

did not distinguish between claims brought

10

pursuant to the compact and claims brought

11

pursuant to other laws.

12

issue because the Master, in his

13

recommendation, distinguished between such

14

claims.

15

That distinction is at

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'd -- I'd like to

16

know what they are.

17

first and then tell me how any interests have

18

not been addressed in the New Mexico state

action?

20

discrete question before us, but I still don't

21

quite understand why you need this claim.

22

What's different -- what's different from that

23

New Mexico claim?

24
25

So could you identify them

I know that's not an issue in this

MS. O'CONNELL:

You're asking about

the difference between a compact claim and a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

claim brought under reclamation law, for

2

example?

3
4
5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The treaty or

reclamation?
MS. O'CONNELL:

I think the -- the

6

problem we're trying to avoid here is that when

7

the United States sues somebody for a violation

8

of reclamation law, taking water from a

9

reclamation project without a contract or

10

acting in a way that undermines the United

11

States' ability to comply with a treaty, it's

12

typically suing the individual water users that

13

are violating those laws or interfering with

14

that obligation of the United States to deliver

15

water under a treaty.

16

What we're trying to avoid here is a

17

future motion to dismiss filed by New Mexico,

18

which -- which indicates or insinuates on page

19

14 of its reply brief that actions brought

20

under reclamation law or under the treaty

21

should be filed against individual water users.

22

We think we can file these claims against New

23

Mexico because of the compact.

24

them against the State of New Mexico because

25

New Mexico has agreed in the compact to protect

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, did you or

4

did you not file a claim under the -- under

5

reclamation law?

6

recognized a claim under that law, but did you

7

make any claim under that law or were you

8

staking your claim on your contact -- compact

9

claim?

10

The Special Master said he

MS. O'CONNELL:

Our complaint doesn't

11

distinguish between claims brought under the

12

compact and claims brought under reclamation

13

law.

14

What -- what our complaint does, as

15

we've done in other cases where we've

16

intervened as a plaintiff, is set forth what

17

the United States' interests are and then tell

18

the Court how we think it can shape injunctive

19

relief against New Mexico to protect those

20

interests.

21

So -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, could you -­

22

can you explain at the outset, you're not

23

claiming that every -- every time there's a

24

compact approved by Congress, you would have a

25

right to come into court as a party, right?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MS. O'CONNELL:

That's correct.

We're -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so what's the

4

dividing line between when you can come in as a

5

party under a compact and when, despite a com

6

-- compact, you can't come in?

7

MS. O'CONNELL:

Where -- where the

8

compact protects specific federal interests

9

that are at stake in the dispute that's been

10

filed in this Court, then we believe the United

11

States can -- can intervene as a plaintiff and

12

bring claims against New Mexico that are based

13

on that compact.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, what's the

15

federal interest that was in the compact?

16

compact does not make any reference to your

17

treaty obligations or to how you meet those.

18

The

It doesn't appear to make any

19

reference to any of the federal interests that

20

you've been identifying.

So do that for me.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

Okay.

This is -- in the

5

definitions of project storage and of usable

8

obligation to deliver water into Elephant Butte

9

Reservoir, into the project.

10

So that's Article I(k) and (l) of the
Article IV defines New Mexico's

Article I(k) defines project storage

11

as the combined capacity of Elephant Butte

12

Reservoir and the reservoirs below it.

13

14

Those

In Article I(l), the definition of

15

usable water says that all -- the usable water

16

is "all water, exclusive of credit water, which

17

is in project storage and which is available

18

for release in accordance with irrigation

19

demands, including deliveries to Mexico."

20

Those -- those deliveries that Article

21

I(l) refers to, what -- what the usable water

22

that's delivered into the Project is to be used

23

for, are releases that the Bureau of

24

Reclamation makes because it operates the

25

Project, it has contracts with irrigation

districts below the -- the Project, and it has

a treaty with Mexico saying how much -- how

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -­

What error in the

format -­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- what -­

8

what difference does it make -- I mean, if -­

9

if you are not entitled to raise this claim as

10

a party, certainly you can participate as an

11

amicus and make whatever arguments you want

12

about how the compact should be properly

13

construed, right?

14

MS. O'CONNELL:

That's correct.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what

16

difference does it make to you which way we

17

rule on the question whether or not you're

18

entitled to raise these claims yourself?

19

MS. O'CONNELL:

I think a couple of

20

reasons.

21

in this case because New Mexico asserted that

22

the United States is a required party.

23

First of all, we -- we've intervened

And the United States operates this

24

reservoir that the Court will -- will be

25

deciding what is Texas's compact apportionment,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

what is New Mex -- New Mexico's compact

2

apportionment under the reservoir.

3

Mexico explained in -- in its -- its brief

4

opposing Texas's motion for leave to even file

5

this complaint in the first place, you need the

6

United States to be bound by that decree

7

because we are the entity that releases that

8

water.

9

And as New

Additionally, we have interests that

10

are at stake in delivering water to Mexico

11

pursuant to a treaty that makes sense, where -­

12

where we would like to be a party presenting

13

the federal interests, rather than being an

14

amicus.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is a

16

pretty basic question I suppose I should know,

17

but can you compromise state rights in the

18

negotiation and determination of a treaty?

19

Could you negotiate a treaty with Mexico that

20

says we're going to give you this many

21

acre-feet of water that is already appropriated

22

somewhere else?

23

obligation trumps whatever the prior

24

allocations are?

25

And then that treaty

MS. O'CONNELL:

I'm not totally sure.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

I -- I think probably yes.

2

doesn't matter because the treaty preexisted

3

the compact.

4

The compact was enacted in -- in 1939.

5

that treaty obligation predates the compact.

6

In this case, it

The treaty was enacted in 1906.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so

Well, it -- usually

7

the latter in time prevails because Congress

8

can pass a statute after a treaty.

9
10

MS. O'CONNELL:

It's not -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -­
-- this is not a

11

completely clear area of the law, but there -­

12

there is a general working rule applied in some

13

of the cases that the later-in-time controls if

14

there's a conflict between a treaty and a later

15

federal statute.

16

MS. O'CONNELL:

And -- and we don't

17

think there's any kind of a conflict here.

18

fact, Article XVI of the treaty specifically

19

disclaims any intent to affect the United

20

States' treaty obligation to Mexico.

21

In

So we think that article should be

22

read to mean that we're still going with 60,000

23

acre-feet, we're still going with the terms of

24

the treaty obligation which Congress, as -- as

25

you say, Justice Kennedy, could change as a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1
2

matter of domestic law.
But here the parties agreed in the

3

compact that they would protect releases from

4

the Project, that that water delivered into the

5

Project becomes usable water that Reclamation

6

releases in accordance with irrigation demands

7

and to satisfy its treaty obligation to Mexico.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. O'Connell -­

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't

10

understand what -- what you mean when you say

11

that if you're not a party, you're not going to

12

be bound by the decree.

13

I mean, if we determine that New

14

Mexico is free to take additional water,

15

whatever it is under the -- under -- between

16

the end of the reservoir and -- and -- and the

17

borderline, what does it mean to say you're not

18

bound by that?

19

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, I think that's

20

-- it's sort of the flip side of the argument

21

that we're a required party.

22

the United States to implement that decree, and

23

surely, I mean, if -- I don't know that if the

24

Court said here is what Texas's compact

25

apportionment is and here is what New Mexico's

You -- you need

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

is, that the United States would sit back and

2

say:

3

different amount, so we're going to go with a

4

different amount, but I think that's what makes

5

us a required party.

6

asserting that you need us here and that's why

7

we're here trying to be helpful and -- and

8

asserting in our complaint what the federal

9

interests are that we are seeking to protect.

Well, our -- our contracts still say a

10

That's why New Mexico is

So since -- since the United States

11

needs to be bound by that decree in order for

We are -- we are willing to be bound by that

15

decree.

16

be permitted to proceed -­

17

And all that we're asking is that we

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Would I be right,

18

though, that -- that your argument would also

19

allow you to have initiated the suit in the

20

first place?

21

hadn't been a suit between the states, that you

22

could have said:

23

too much water and is preventing us from

24

meeting our obligations and -- and that you

25

could have initiated a suit under the compact?

In other words, even if there

New Mexico is -- is taking

Heritage Reporting Corporation

14
1

MS. O'CONNELL:

Yes.

We -- we do make

2

an argument at the end of our brief in

3

opposition to New Mexico's motion to dismiss

4

that, even if -- if Texas's complaint were

5

dismissed here, the United States' claims

6

against New Mexico could go forward.

7

I don't think the Court needs to reach

8

that, because Texas's complaint is going

9

forward.

10
11

This Court has denied New Mexico's

motion to dismiss.

But that -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what's the

12

difference?

13

the right to intervene, even though you don't

14

have the right to bring your own suit

15

initially?

16

How could we say, yes, you have

MS. O'CONNELL:

The Court's standard

17

for intervention is that intervention of the

18

United States is appropriate where there is

19

distinctive federal interests at stake that are

20

best presented by the United States.

21

So, I mean, I guess the Court could

22

say, you know, we don't have any claims, but we

23

could be a defendant, something like that.

24

-- we need to be here in the case in order to

2

But our argument that we -­

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Ms. O'Connell, one

4

of the federal interests you've asserted is the

5

treaty with Mexico.

6

interacts with this Court's decision in

7

Medellin, where this Court distinguished

8

between self-executing treaties and treaties

9

that aren't self-executing.

10

And I'm curious how it

Is the treaty here self-executing?

11

And if it's not, then how is it a federal

12

interest to seek a binding enforceable judgment

13

on the basis in domestic law of a treaty that

14

isn't enforceable under domestic law?

15

MS. O'CONNELL:

I am not sure.

I'm -­

16

I have not -- the State Department was not

17

included in our, you know, our -- our

18

collaboration in this case, so I don't -- I

19

20

a self-executing treaty.

21

It was enacted in the public laws -­

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

executed for how many years?

And the United States makes

MS. O'CONNELL:

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

4

MS. O'CONNELL:

Okay.
I don't.
All right.
Justice Kagan, to get

5

back to your question, the reason why we think

6

that we can bring a claim to enforce this

7

compact against New Mexico is based on this

8

Court's line of cases, that we've cited a few

9

in our briefs, Sanitary District of Chicago

10

versus United States, and a Fourth Circuit

11

case, the County of Arlington versus United

12

States, where this Court and -- and the Fourth

13

Circuit in that case have held that the United

14

States can bring suits for injunctive relief to

15

protect federal interests that are at stake in

16

a dispute.

17

In Sanitary District of Chicago, the

18

United States sued an Illinois corporation that

19

was using too much water, water in excess of

20

its permit allocation.

21

brought a suit directly against the

22

corporation.

23

And the United States

This Court said there's no statutory

24

cause of action that's required.

The United

25

States can just bring that claim for injunctive

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1
2

relief to protect.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

And if I could return

3

-- I'm sorry -- to Justice Sotomayor's question

4

to make sure I understood the answer to it.

5

I know you're afraid that if this goes

6

forward under reclamation law, you might be

7

subject to this motion to dismiss on the ground

8

that you can't sue a state under that law.

9

But putting that aside, is the content

10

of the two suits, if you had brought the -- the

11

suit under reclamation law, and if you had

12

brought the suit under the compact, is the

13

content of the suits different or the same?

14

MS. O'CONNELL:

I think it's -- it's

15

the same, because -- and that's part of the

16

reason why we are filing an exception here to

17

the Master's recommendation that our complaint

18

has to be dismissed to the extent it states a

19

compact claim, is that the reason we think New

20

Mexico is bound by these obligations to protect

21

the Project and to have its water users not

22

violate reclamation law or undermine the treaty

23

is because New Mexico has signed onto the

24

compact agreeing to protect the Project.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your -- your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

-- your argument really is like an implied

2

right of action argument, isn't it?

3

the compact doesn't give you any rights and yet

4

you say because it affects your interests, you

5

have a right to sue.

6

I mean,

And you make the third-party

7

beneficiary argument, which is an argument

8

that's often made to support an implied right

9

of action.

But you have to approve a compact,

10

you, the federal government, before it goes

11

into effect.

12

Couldn't you have protected your

13

interests at that time?

14

MS. O'CONNELL:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, our -­
By saying

16

we're not going to approve -- we're not going

17

to approve it unless we have the right to

18

bring, you know, claims to enforce it?

19

could imagine a group of states or two states

20

saying:

21

this, but we don't want the United States

22

coming in and -- and, you know, mucking

23

everything up.

24
25

And you

All right, I'm happy to agree with

And so long as you're okay with that,
and -- and -- and, you know, you give your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

consent, I don't know why you should be allowed

2

to litigate as a party.

3

MS. O'CONNELL:

I'm -- I'm not aware

4

of any compacts where the United States has

5

preserved that right for itself to intervene

6

and bring suits to bring people into compliance

7

with a compact.

8
9

I think here, I wouldn't necessarily
think of it so much as a compact claim but a

10

suit for equitable relief where the relief

11

we're asking for is that New Mexico be required

12

to comply with its compact obligations.

13

of action is coming, just from this Court's

cases like Sanitary District, In re Debs, the

And because this Court is -- is acting

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER,

SOLICITOR GENERAL OF TEXAS,

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

MR. KELLER:

Justice, and may it please the Court:

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief

The U.S. can raise its own compact
claims because the compact creates a statutory

10

duty for the U.S. to distribute water to Texas.

11

This statutory duty arises from three key

12

facts.

13

First, the U.S. owns and operates the

14

Rio Grande Project.

15

necessary predicate for the compact's equitable

16

apportionment, to quote Nebraska versus

17

Wyoming.

18

means to actually distribute the equitable

19

apportionment to Texas.

20

Second, that Project is a

And, third, that Project is the sole

And so, to put it succinctly and quote

21

22

intended to use the Project as the vehicle to

23

guarantee delivery of Texas's equitable

24

apportionment.

25

New Mexico if New Mexico's actions are

The U.S. can, therefore, sue

preventing the U.S. from fulfilling this

2

statutory duty to distribute Texas's equitable

3

apportionment.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could the United

5

States file, General Keller, an -- an action in

6

the district court in the absence of a dispute

7

between Texas and Mexico -- and -- and New

8

Mexico, and the suit would say there's a

9

violation of -- of the compact even though

10

there's no dispute between the states?

11

MR. KELLER:

Yes, because of the

12

nature of this unique compact.

13

water that New Mexico delivers to the federal

14

government is in the middle of New Mexico

15

instead of at the state line, the United States

16

then as a carrier or a distributor has a duty

17

to ensure that there's an equitable

18

apportionment.

19

of the Special Master's correct conclusion that

20

when New Mexico deposits water at Elephant

21

Butte Reservoir, they must relinquish control.

22

Now, when New Mexico is relinquishing

Because the

And so this goes to the heart

23

control, they're relinquishing control to the

24

federal government.

25

for this compact to work.

There'd be no other way
And that's precisely

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

why the compact itself refers directly or

2

indirectly over 50 times to the Project.

3

that is the federal project operated by the

4

Bureau of Reclamation.

5

And

And so, Justice Kennedy, the United

6

States could sue New Mexico to enforce its

7

ability to ensure that Texas receives its

8

equitable apportionment, just like the compact

9

does provide for the usable water definition

10

and the irrigation demands, including what is

11

also being delivered to Mexico.

12

long-standing practice of the parties -- and

13

this is in the Master's report at page 209 -­

14

that there's a -- generally 60,000 acre-feet of

15

water being delivered to New Mexico.

16

that's coming off the top before we get into

the parties' accepted 57 to 43 percent split

18

between the water.

4

water?

And it can.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell

me -­

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Excuse me.

Is that

8

different from saying they can -- that they're

9

bringing an action under the terms of the

MR. KELLER:

No, that would be a -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Or is that the same

13

-- is that just another way of saying the same

14

thing?

15

MR. KELLER:

I believe it -- it is

16

another way of saying the same thing.

17

claims arise under the compact itself because

18

the compact is doing an interstate equitable

19

apportionment between New Mexico, Colorado, and

20

Texas.

21

Their

Now, my friends on the other side have

22

spoken often about treaty claims and

23

reclamation law claims that would invoke state

24

law.

25

that Texas has raised here is about the compact

But the central focus of this lawsuit

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

and the interstate equitable apportionment as

2

opposed to any intrastate allotment.

3

And so the Reclamation Act claims that

4

the Special Master said could go forward that

5

the United States has raised, those may not

6

necessarily be claims against another state as

7

a sovereign, and so there would be potential

8

confusion if the United States' claims were not

9

compact claims in an original action between

10

sovereigns but, rather, instead were somehow

11

reclamation law claims that were invoking state

12

law against particular water users.

13

And so I think for judicial economy,

14

the proper way for this lawsuit to go forward

15

is indeed to allow the United States and Texas

16

to bring compact interstate equitable

17

apportionment claims.

18

resolved -­

19

And if those are

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now I understand.

20

You are actually taking the position that the

21

federal government can't sue another state for

22

reclamation claims.

23

farmers who are diverting the water.

24
25

MR. KELLER:

They would have to sue the

That -- that is -- that

is probably correct because there would not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

necessarily be a -- a state law basis under the

2

Reclamation Act to -- to invoke a lawsuit

3

against a sovereign state.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So unless the

5

government can claim that New Mexico has an

6

obligation and it can, therefore, sue under the

7

compact, that's why -- now I understand.

8
9

MR. KELLER:

And -- and not only that

but also under Hinderlider and that line of

10

cases, when there are these disputes between

11

states, it is going to be New Mexico's duty to

12

prevent diversions of water.

13

were particular water users, under this

14

compact, New Mexico cannot allow diversions

15

that would interfere with Texas's equitable

16

apportionment, which is exactly what we're

17

pleading.

So even if there

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

let the U.S. intervene but not beyond

20

addressing any legal matter beyond the compact

21

claims.

22

envisioned they might try to do and -- and why

23

we would at this early stage opine on that

24

issue.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Seems like an

advisory opinion to the Special Master.

3

MR. KELLER:

Well, you would not

4

necessarily have to opine on precisely how the

5

litigation will go forward; however, the -- the

6

crux of this lawsuit is an interstate equitable

7

apportionment compact claim.

8

Justice Sotomayor, that's precisely why the

9

United States is here, wanting to raise those

10

And I believe,

compact claims.

11

But for purposes of how that would

12

operate, knowing whether the suit would be

13

against a sovereign state or knowing if it

14

would be against individual water users, that

15

would certainly affect the interests involved

16

in how the case would proceed.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why is that?

18

I -- I mean, is this really just a question of

19

timing?

20

States can't raise these claims because of our

21

view about how the compact applies.

22

mean, is there any reason not to go forward

23

with the -- the litigation or at the end, if -­

24

if the Master thinks they don't have a claim

25

under the Compact Clause, then they can say

I mean, they're saying the United

But, I

that at that time?

2

But -- but at this point, we now have

3

to make determinations that I'm concerned about

4

the impact on other compacts and -- and what's

5

involved besides simply the timing.

6

MR. KELLER:

And, Mr. Chief Justice,

7

from our perspective, the practical difference

8

is going to be minimal.

9

will continue to bring its compact claims, and

The State of Texas

10

the equitable apportionment is at the center of

11

that dispute.

12

At the same time, the Court can rule

13

that the United States can bring its own

14

compact claims here because of the unique

15

nature of this compact, given that the delivery

16

of water occurs in the middle of New Mexico,

17

and then the United States is the distributor

18

and carrier, to use the language of the 1945

19

Nebraska versus Wyoming decision, to ensure

20

that that -- that Texas's equitable apportioned

21

water, while it is being relinquished control

22

in the middle of New Mexico instead of the

23

state line, does reach Texas and indeed to New

24

Mexico.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think I should have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

asked Ms. O'Connell this, but do you view the

2

United States' interests as diverging from

3

Texas's interests in any way?

4

MR. KELLER:

We -- yes, we will have

5

some disputes, and this will come up later in

6

the litigation, over precisely how the

7

equitable apportionment should be calculated,

8

but for purposes of the question presented to

9

this Court today, we do not diverge and we

10

believe the United States should be able to

11

raise its own compact claims.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, but I meant as the

13

litigation proceeds, would there be a

14

difference if only you were in the lawsuit

15

as -- you know, and with, presumably, the

16

United States as an amicus versus having the

17

United States in as a party?

18

MR. KELLER:

Well, potentially,

19

Justice Kagan, just based on the -- the

20

arguments that would be raised as to whether

21

the equitable apportionment was actually being

22

fulfilled.

23

thrust of the argument, the United States

24

agrees with Texas that New Mexico is allowing

25

diversions of water and therefore interfering

But as far as the -- the main

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We're agreeing on that.

6

11

issues?

She's asked -­
Where would

Well, one issue -­
In what -- what

Are there issues in which there can be

a difference?
MR. KELLER:

Possibly.

One issue, for

12

instance, there was an -- a settlement

13

agreement, an operating agreement, that the

14

State of Texas never entered into and so it

15

could not be bound by.

16

But the current practice is to use a

17

regression analysis that was looking at dates

18

from the 1950s to the 1970s to calculate return

19

flows, which is going to affect the amount of

20

water that is going to be part of the project

21

lands, the usable water.

22

Now, our position is that it's the

23

compact in -- in the time of 1938, when the

24

compact was entered into, that should control

25

that analysis, rather than a regression

analysis years later.

3

That is one example of

However, these are going to be

arguments that will play out in the remainder

But for purposes of the

11

you'd be happier if those issues were settled

in one litigation rather than to have to start

MR. KELLER:

Yes.

And we believe that

15

this lawsuit should continue forward and -- and

16

the State of Texas be allowed to raise these

17

compact claims and -- and settle this

18

interstate equitable apportionment as soon as

practicable.

If there are no further questions.

relegated to amicus status in future disputes

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the United

about this case is the prominence of the

MR. YARGER:

And -- and I don't agree

that the prominence of the federal facility in

prominence of federal facilities on, for

the United States was amicus in the Republican

they're the same because, as the government

why we think it is perfectly appropriate for

this very new argument in our mind of the

separate opinions that the Special Master

that the United States never sought affirmative

summary judgment relief in the '93 opinion, but

15

I don't think it ever sought affirmative relief

16

under that decree.

17

that it had any obligations under that decree.

I also

It never -- it sought defensive

There is something I

MR. YARGER:

There -- the United

States absolutely has to approve a compact, but
what it approves is the terms of that compact.
And the terms of this compact give

12

substantive rights to Texas, and the

13

commissioners who have voting rights, the

14

United States does not have a voting right on

15

this Commission, to demand releases of water

16

to -- to carry out the equitable apportionment

17

of the compact.

18

What I will say is I think there is a

19

difference that -- that the United States

20

doesn't draw in its briefing between

21

legislation carried out under the Commerce

22

Clause or under the treaty power and choosing

23

to go a different route, which is to say,

24

telling New Mexico and Colorado and Texas back

25

in the early -- early '20s:

Negotiate this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

compact and decide the apportionment among

2

yourselves, and that will be the way that we

3

determine how this water is apportioned.

the United States has important interests here?

And, you know, part of those interests

16

are international, having to do with the

17

relationship with Mexico, but part of them are

18

domestic because the United States is and was

19

even prior to this compact in a set of

20

contractual agreements that -- that give it

23

So do you agree that the interests are
pretty strong here?

24

MR. YARGER:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So how in your

view does the United States protect those

2

interests?

3

MR. YARGER:

Well, I think it -- it -­

4

two ways:

5

treaty interests, absolutely, we think that

6

it's appropriate to include treaty claims in

7

this case.

8

First of all, with respect to the

Second of all, with respect to all of

9

those interests, which are identical to those

10

that are at issue in cases like Kansas versus

11

Nebraska, it does what it's always done, which

12

is -­

13

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:
means.

I don't know what that

Do those mean the domestic issues?
MR. YARGER:

Yes, the domestic issues

16

which Congress has said for 130 years, project

17

rights are state law water rights that are

18

subsumed within an equitable apportionment that

19

the states either negotiate or this Court sets.

20

So it's no different from the many cases the

21

United States has participated in, either as

22

amicus, which I think is a pretty strong

23

indication that in past cases at least, the

24

United States hasn't saw fit to try to

25

establish the precedent of being able to take

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

states into litigation when they're not in

2

litigation, and -- and it can assert those

3

interests and make all the arguments that it

4

needs to make.

5

And I think it gets back to the -­

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But -- but, Mr.

7

Yarger, I'm still stuck on -- on this.

I

8

understand your -- your carving out of the

9

treaty interests, but the United States has

10

preexisting contract obligations to two water

11

districts to provide a certain amount of water.

12

And the resolution of this compact

13

dispute could affect the United States' ability

14

to fulfill its contractual obligations.

15

think you'd agree with that.

16
17
18

MR. YARGER:

I

I -- I would agree with

that.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Then why isn't -­

19

why isn't that significant federal interest

20

right there?

21

MR. YARGER:

It's -- it's not that

22

it's not a significant federal interest.

It's

23

a question of what is the substantive right the

24

United States is asserting here.

25

like Hinderlider.

And it's just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The United States' rights to this

water arise under New Mexico law, in fact, New

consistent with the scheme that Congress put in

7

place when it said, U.S., go to state court and

8

get water rights.

That's how we will affect these

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, let's

12

take a situation in which the contract is

13

clear.

14

You have to deliver X cubic feet of water every

15

year.

16

It authorizes the United States to -- or

17

there's a federal law that authorizes the

18

United States to distribute that water in a

19

certain way.

20

All right?

Forget about surface water.

And the compact is just like this one.

Now you breach.

It's your position

21

that the government couldn't come in and say to

22

you:

23

federal interest in ensuring that the contracts

24

that I signed, dependent on your clear

25

contractual obligation, doesn't give me a right

that contract -­

MR. YARGER:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and obligated

5

you to do something to the -- for -- to the -­

6

for the United States?

7

MR. YARGER:

Justice Sotomayor, we're

8

not taking a position on any other type of

9

claim the United States may or may not have

10

under other substantive bodies of law,

11

including state law, treaties, and reclamation

12

law.

13

All we're saying is that this, as

14

Texas said I think several times during

15

argument, at the heart of this case is an

16

apportionment between the states.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But think about this.

18

This goes back -- Justice Breyer said, look,

19

Congress approved this compact.

20

against a backdrop in which the United States

21

already had obligations, obligations to Mexico,

22

but also contractual obligations to domestic

23

parties.

Now, it did so

24

Now, how could it have approved that

25

compact unless it said we took a look at this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

compact and we think it will allow us to

2

fulfill all of our obligations, both domestic

3

and international?

4

like this that the approval of the compact was

5

premised on an understanding that it would

6

protect the United States' own interests, which

7

is exactly what the United States is trying to

8

assert here.

9

You have to think in a case

MR. YARGER:

And -- and I think the

10

question is how does the United States protect

11

that interest, because the premise of the

12

compact was also the 1902 Reclamation Act,

13

which was in effect for 36 years before this

14

compact was signed and said very clearly:

15

Federal government, go to state court, go to

16

state administrative mechanisms to get your

17

water right.

18

Hinderlider said:

19

right you get under state law will always be

20

subservient to and contained within either a

21

compact or a decree set by this Court.

22

And then this Court in
And by the way, whatever

So I think it's a question of where -­

23

how does the -- does the United States protect

24

those interests and what is the substantive

25

body of law under which it can do so?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARCUS J. RAEL, JR.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT NEW MEXICO

8

MR. RAEL:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

I have three points -- main points

11

that I'd like to make on behalf of the State of

12

New Mexico today, the first of which is that

13

New Mexico agrees with the Special Master and

14

Colorado that the United States cannot raise

15

compact claims in this matter.

16

Secondly, New Mexico has not taken

17

exception to the Special Master's

18

recommendation that the United States be

19

allowed to raise a claim under reclamation law

20

in order to protect its interests.

21

Finally, New Mexico does not dispute

22

that the United States can bring a claim for

23

alleged interference with its 1906 treaty with

24

Mexico.

25

-- does not arise under the -- under the

It's just that that claim also arises

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

compact, but under the treaty itself.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Are you -­

And how do you think

4

those claims would differ from claims that are

5

brought under the compact?

6

MR. RAEL:

Well, Justice Kagan, the -­

7

the -- the treaty itself has a mechanism which

8

allows the United States to enforce the

9

treaty -- its treaty obligations at any time.

10

And the -- and the -- I think the main

11

difference is that if you -- if -- if -- and as

12

this Court has already deemed, that if the

13

United States is allowed to enforce its treaty

14

obligation of the 60,000 acre-feet a year under

15

the treaty, then you don't open that door under

16

the compact claim that my colleague was just

17

speaking about, which would allow the United

18

States to -- to -- to, for the first time ever,

19

raise a -- a compact claim in a -- in a -- in a

20

compact under which it receives no allocation

21

of water.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and what about

23

these other obligations that the United States

24

has?

25

law claims for those.

You said that you can bring reclamation
What's the difference

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1
2

there?
I mean, I'm trying to figure out why

3

everybody cares so much that this is a claim

4

under the compact, rather than under these

5

other bodies of law.

6

MR. RAEL:

I -- Justice Kagan, I -- I

7

think everybody cares so much because the -­

8

the Reclamation Act of 1902 is a very

9

comprehensive body of law, and it allows the

10

United States to accomplish almost anything

11

that it's looking to do here.

12

That -- it's important to note that

13

there's no claim -- there's no remedy that the

14

United States is seeking in this litigation

15

that it can't -- under the compact, that it

16

can't receive under that comprehensive body of

17

law that is the Reclamation Act.

18

reason why, I think, New Mexico cares, and I

19

think -- and Colorado as well, is this Court

20

has never allowed the United States to raise a

21

claim under a compact to which it was not a

22

party -- I mean to which it was -- received no

23

allocation of water and to which it was not a

24

signatory.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the

This -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right, but -­

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- this Court has

3

never had occasion to pass on that question.

4

You said "never allowed."

5

It just hasn't ruled on it.

6

MR. RAEL:

It didn't disallow.

Well, Your Honor, I think

7

that's -- that's correct, but I think -- I

8

think what the danger that we're facing here is

9

that if you -- if you read an -- an implicit

10

right here for the United States to raise a

11

claim under a compact which -- which provides

12

it no explicit protections, if you -- if you

13

allow them to -- to -- if you -- if you allow

14

the United States to read that implicit right,

15

then I think you're -- you're opening up a

16

dangerous door in which the United States can

17

raise -- can try to raise implicit rights not

18

only in -- in this compact but in every compact

19

across the country.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How -­

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose one

22

reason the United States may be interested is

23

if it has compact claims that are litigated

24

here.

25

they're litigated in a complex proceeding in

If they're under the Reclamation Act,

MR. RAEL:

No, Your Honor.

I -- I

3

think the -- the Special Master in this case

4

found a very elegant solution, and that's why

5

we don't oppose it.

6

participate in this case under the Reclamation

7

Act, as I said, there's no remedy that they've

8

sought in their complaint in this case that -­

9

that they can't get under the Reclamation Act

10
11

In -- in allowing them to

of 1902 that they can get under the compact.
And so it would be litigated here, in

12

this Court, for purposes of judicial economy

13

and to avoid inconsistent rules.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15
16

And not under state

law but under federal law?
MR. RAEL:

Under the -- under the

17

McCarran Amendment, the -- the -- the United

18

States' water rights are subject to state law,

19

but New Mexico would -- would -- and -- and any

20

-- any compacting state administers the water

21

rights, but we can't do so in a manner which is

22

inconsistent with the compact.

23

Therefore, this Court has already

24

placed those protections in place so -- so that

25

the United States' reclamation law claim and -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

and, indeed, in this case, its reclamation

2

project, is protected in the sense that we

3

cannot administer our state water rights, our

4

sovereign water in such a manner that it

5

interferes with the compact.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, let's

go -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Am I right that -­

that New Mexico had argued at an earlier stage

10

that the United States was a necessary party to

11

this litigation?

12

MR. RAEL:

13

argue that, and -­

14

Yes, Your Honor, we did

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I will ask you

15

the same question I asked before.

16

that the United States was a necessary party in

17

this very litigation.

18

they're not even a permitted party.

19

MR. RAEL:

You argued

And now you're saying

Justice Ginsburg, I -- I

20

apologize.

21

saying is that New Mexico is arguing that the

22

United States is a necessary party, but their

23

claims arise under the Reclamation Act of 1902

24

and not under the compact.

25

I'm not saying that.

What I'm

And so the Special Master was correct

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

in his recommendation that the United States

2

should participate in order to enforce its

3

treaty obligations, but it does so under the

4

treaty, which it can bring in -- in this

5

litigation.

6

And as far as rights it's trying to

7

enforce, as far as its -- its water rights and

8

other interests, those would be brought under

9

the Reclamation Act of 1902 in this litigation.

10

So they are a necessary party, just

11

not -- not a -- not -- they're just not allowed

12

to bring compact claims in our opinion.

13
14
15

I'd like to point real quickly to the
third -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the -- but when

16

you made that claim it was only a compact, this

17

case was about a compact between New Mexico and

18

Texas, and it was in that setting that you said

19

the United States was necessary.

20

MR. RAEL:

You -- you are correct,

21

Justice Ginsburg -- Ginsburg.

22

backed away from that position when we acceded

23

to the fact that the Project is incorporated

24

into the -- into the compact.

25

New Mexico

It's just in the incorporation of that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58

Project, we're not acceding to the fact that -­

2

that the United States, who's not a signatory

3

and whose apportion of water has any claims or

4

rights -- rights of enforcement under the

5

compact itself.

6

entities:

7

Mexico, and the State of Colorado.

8

That's between three sovereign

the State of Texas, the State of New

What we're saying is that we -- we -­

9

we -- the Special Master found a very elegant

10

solution which we support and think that they

11

still need to participate, but participating

12

under the Reclamation Act and under the treaty

13

itself is -- is the manner in which the United

14

States can -- can find its remedies.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you differing

16

from Texas and acknowledging that the U.S.

17

could sue New Mexico for a reclamation claim so

18

that it doesn't have to sue the individual

19

water users?

20

MR. RAEL:

I -- I -- I am, Your Honor,

21

in -- in the sense that -- that the -- the

22

Reclamation Act of 1902 is so comprehensive

23

that the United States under -- under all of

24

the different portions of the Reclamation Act

25

can sue, in our opinion, the State of New

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59

Mexico.

2

And I think it's important to note

3

that in -- in -- in Nebraska v. Wyoming, the

4

United States was saying -- actually said:

5

We -- we can't be sued because we weren't

6

apportioned any water.

7

States is saying:

8

though we haven't been apportioned any water.

9

And yet here the United

We can sue New Mexico even

And so that -- that -- that's

10

inconsistent in my opinion.

11

they sought their defensive motion for summary

12

judgment, that -- that was their -- their

13

argument.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

When they -- when

Do you think a state

15

could sue the United States under this compact

16

if the United States started acting in a way

17

that was inconsistent with its terms?

18

MR. RAEL:

Justice Kagan, yes, I do -­

19

I do believe so.

I believe that -- that a

20

state has the -- the opportunity to try and sue

21

the United States, for example, if we were to

22

say -- if New Mexico was to say:

23

operation of the Project is interfering with

24

our ability to meet our compact obligations to

25

the State of Texas, I believe that we could do

Your -- your

that.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, if the United

3

States is so integrally a part of this system

4

that a state could sue the federal government,

5

why can't the same be true back again the other

6

way?

7

MR. RAEL:

Because the United States

8

doesn't own any -- any right -- any water, any

9

rights under -- under the compact, or even

10

under the project.

11

owned by the landowners themselves who are

represented by their individual states as

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL

24

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS INTERVENOR

25

MS. O'CONNELL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

Justice.

Three points in rebuttal.

2

The first is in response to Colorado's

3

argument that the complaint filed by the United

4

States in this case is unprecedented.

5

not.

6

It's

The case that Colorado is -- is

7

relying upon, Kansas versus Nebraska, was a

8

case where there was an admitted violation of a

9

compact by Nebraska.

The states were just

10

talking about what the damages were.

11

United States' operations of any projects in

12

that region were not going to be affected by

13

what the damages were.

14

participated in this case as an amicus.

15

The

That's why we

In other cases, we've cited some in

16

our briefs, Texas versus New Mexico, the Pecos

17

River case, and also Texas and New Mexico

18

versus Colorado, a prior case brought in order

19

to enforce this same compact, the Rio Grande

20

Compact, in both of those cases the defendant

21

state, so in the Pecos River case, New Mexico,

22

and in -- in Texas versus Colorado, Colorado,

23

asserted that the United States was a required

24

party to the action.

25

And so, to be helpful, we intervened

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

as a plaintiff in each of those cases,

2

presented what the United States' interests

3

were, and then asked for general equitable

4

relief, whatever relief would protect our

5

interests.

6

In the Texas versus Colorado, the

7

United States specifically explained that even

8

though it has no apportionment of water under

9

the Rio Grande Compact, it acknowledged that

10

the compact could be interpreted in such a way

11

as to affect the United States' interests and

12

it believed its interests would be protected by

13

Colorado's compliance with the compact.

14
15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

signatures in either of those two cases, right?

16

MS. O'CONNELL:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

You weren't

No.
To the compacts I

mean?

19

MS. O'CONNELL:

That's correct.

And

20

in both cases, we were permitted to intervene.

21

We filed complaints against the defendant

22

state.

23

The second point, just reiterating

24

that -- or answering the question whether there

25

is a difference between the claims asserted by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

Texas and the United States, their interests

2

are not necessarily completely aligned in this

3

case.

4

delivery obligations both in New Mexico and

5

Texas.

6

expected to rely on Texas to assert its

7

interests here.

This is an interstate project that has

So the United States couldn't be

8

The Project also has international

9

obligations to Mexico, as we have discussed

10

quite a bit, and I'll point out that under

11

Article II of that treaty with Mexico, if

12

there's not enough water for the irrigation

13

districts in the United States, the -- the

14

amount that we send to Mexico becomes less.

15

And so the United States has quite an

16

interest that we couldn't be expected to rely

17

on Texas to protect, in making sure that -­

18

that Mexico is not being shorted because of the

19

way that the compact is interpreted.

20

Finally, just on this point of, as

21

Justice Kagan put it, why everybody cares so

22

much about whether these are compact claims or

23

reclamation law claims, the Master said that we

24

could bring reclamation law claims.

25

totally sure that that's enough to bring claims

We're not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

against the State of New Mexico.

2

The reason why New Mexico is a proper

3

defendant against such claims is because of the

4

compact, because the compact has bound New

5

Mexico to protect the Project and to allow the

6

United States to release water in -- in order

7

to -- to meet its contract obligations and its

8

treaty obligations to Mexico.

9

And so we don't want there to be any

10

confusion going forward when the United -- when

11

the Master says the United States' complaint

12

has to be dismissed to the extent it brings

13

claims under the compact, what that means.

14

think we sort of need the compact to make those

15

other claims work.

16
17
18
19

Thank you.
