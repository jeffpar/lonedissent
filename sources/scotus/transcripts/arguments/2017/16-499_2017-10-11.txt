Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

This Court made clear in Kiobel that

12

the ATS should be construed first and foremost

13

according to the ordinary rules of statutory

14

construction.

15

And applying those tools here yields a

16

straightforward result.

17

presumption that corporations can be held

18

liable in civil actions for torts controls

19

here.

20

The traditional

Now, the bank's principal response is

21

to say that the ATS sometimes can create

22

formulations issues when cases are brought

23

against corporations.

24

that objection does not overcome the strong

25

presumption of tort liability here.

But for two reasons,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

4
1

First, some ATS cases do not involve

2

foreign relations at all.

3

example.

4

cannot justify the categorical rule the Second

5

Circuit has laid down in this area.

6

indeed, a categorical bar against corporate

7

liability would itself create foreign relations

8

problems along the lines the ATS was designed

9

to put -- to solve.

10

Take piracy, for

So a foreign relations argument

And,

And second, even when there are

11

foreign relations issues, and perhaps this is

12

an even more important point, there are many

13

other doctrines readily available to courts to

14

directly and effectively deal with those

15

issues.

16

There's no need to use the mismatched

17

theory of -- of no corporate liability when you

18

have tools available under the common law to

19

address the arguments when they arise.

20

Take the extraterritoriality holding

21

of Kiobel first and foremost.

As the Court

22

stressed in that case, the theory of the

23

extraterritoriality presumption -­

24

anti-extraterritoriality presumption is to keep

25

the U.S. out of foreign relations friction by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

5
1

applying its law overly aggressively to

2

incidents elsewhere in the world.

3

Now, after Kiobel, I would suggest

4

that that extraterritoriality holding has had

5

its intended effect.

6

cited on the other side about the number of ATS

7

suits that have been brought over the past

8

couple of decades, but the relevant question

9

for this Court is, what does the landscape look

10
11

There are many statistics

like now in the post-Kiobel world?
And the Chamber of Commerce has

12

actually done a study on this, and that study

13

noted that, at the time of Kiobel, there were

14

40 cases pending against corporations.

15

two years after Kiobel, over 70 percent of

16

those cases were dismissed on

17

extraterritoriality grounds and another

18

10 percent were dismissed for other reasons.

19

So what you have -­

20
21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In the

How about Daimler?

Would Daimler -­

25

MR. FISHER:

Yes, we think that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You can only sue

3

4

5

care of most of the next 30 percent?

6

MR. FISHER:

Will that take

Well, that would take

7

care of general jurisdiction claims.

Of

8

course, here we have a specific jurisdiction

9

claim, and the bank, because of its presence in

10

New York, has never even made a personal

11

jurisdiction argument, but, yes, Justice

12

Sotomayor, that would be another tool available

13

to district courts.

14

And so now what you have is a very,

15

very small universe of cases, a manageable

16

universe of cases, one that makes the U.S.

17

position in this respect very much like other

18

courts' in the world, particularly our close

19

allies in Europe and in -- otherwise in North

20

America, as the Comparative Law Scholars' brief

21

points out.

22

to have this corporate liability bar that has

23

no basis -­

And there's no reason whatsoever

4

against a corporation or almost really against

5

anyone?

6

Where else in the world would this type

I'm -- I'm concerned about the foreign

7

entanglement issue.

I mean, we passed this

8

statute to avoid foreign entanglements because

9

we wanted to provide a forum for someone like

10

the French ambassador in the Longchamps Affair,

11

but I'm wondering if extending it to corporate

12

liability is, in fact, going to have the same

13

problematic result of increasing our

14

entanglements, as it obviously has here with

15

respect to the government of Jordan.

16

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think you asked

17

-- the first question is, where else could law

18

-- lawsuits like this be brought?

19

and 44 of our blue brief and at pages 15

20

through I believe it's about 19 of the

21

Comparative Law Scholars' brief, there's a

22

survey of other jurisdictions in the world that

23

are similar lawsuits.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

At pages 43

I'm not

talking about jurisdictions that allow suit

Heritage Reporting Corporation

against corporate defendants.

I'm talking

2

about a case like this one, foreign activity, a

3

foreign defendant brought in a jurisdiction

4

against a corporation seeking monetary relief

5

like that.

6

MR. FISHER:

No -­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's my

8

understanding that the availability of this

9

sort of relief is pretty unique here.

10

MR. FISHER:

Yes and no, Mr. Chief

11

Justice.

12

question you just asked me was the one I was

13

answering.

14

examples like this with corporate defendants

Sometimes, yes;

21

22

again, this brings me back to Justice

23

Sotomayor's point, so here we have -­

8

sort of in between a totally foreign defendant

9

and something inside the country.

10

This is -- this is a case

And so it's sort of an -- it's

But to turn back to your point about

11

the ATS being unique, the answer to that is yes

12

and no.

13

U.S. law effectuates this availability of

14

relief for international law violations.

15

It's unique in the sense of the way

It's not unique in the fact that that

16

availability exists.

17

parts of the world is you have just regular

18

tort claims that can be brought or, in the

19

Netherlands, you can bring a claim directly

20

under a -- under a treaty.

21

in other countries in Europe, you can bring an

22

attendant civil claim attached to criminal

23

prosecutions for violations of the law of

24

nations.

25

So what you have in other

In other cases -­

And it brings me back to what is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

10
1

unusual about the ATS, and it ties into our

2

history with the First Congress.

3

this brings me again back to the purpose of the

4

ATS -- Congress did not want these cases to be

5

brought in state court.

6

more precisely, they didn't want to leave it up

7

to the states as to whether to allow these

8

claims in the first place.

9

Remember -­

They didn't want -­

And so it's a feature of our unique

10

federalism that we have this statute and a

11

statutory way that it allows these claims to be

12

brought.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if we look at

14

that purpose, when we are dealing with what

15

I'll call step 2 of Sosa, so the question of

16

whether we in -- should recognize a federal

17

common law claim under particular

18

circumstances, should we, in effect, balance

19

the international repercussions of deciding the

20

issue one way or the other?

21

So if we hold that corporations can be

22

sued under the -- under the Alien Tort Statute,

23

we have a fair idea that there are going to -­

24

there are going to be cases like this one and

25

like Kiobel that do raise foreign relations

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

11
1
2

concerns.
Now, there are some that you can

3

hypothesize on the other side, but are they at

4

all comparable?

5
6
7

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Alito,

first of all -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Where denying a forum

8

in the United States for a case against a

9

corporation is -- will -- will have equally

10
11

serious foreign policy consequences.
MR. FISHER:

Well, let me start by

12

agreeing with you that, yes, as a matter of

13

your step 2 Sosa authority, you can and should

14

look in part to international implications of

15

having a cause of action like this.

16

But my first answer to your question

17

is that, insofar as you have those concerns,

18

you should deal with it with other doctrines

19

like extraterritoriality, like forum

20

non-convenience, political question, other

21

kinds of doctrines -­

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. FISHER:

24

with those concerns.

25

Which would -­

-- more directly deal

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Which would apply

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

12
1

the same as an individual or a corporation.

2

thought Sosa was saying international law

3

starts out being the law governing relations

4

between states, but now it has gone beyond that

5

and there can be private actors who are

6

governed by the law of nations,

7

international -- international law.

8
9

I

So the -- what I don't comprehend is
why you would split individual and corporation.

10

I -- I read that footnote as saying one thing

11

is you can't sue any private person.

12

the other, you have to consider whether private

13

persons would be included, individuals or

14

corporations.

15

MR. FISHER:

And then

I agree with everything

16

you just said, Justice Ginsburg.

17

that you do not look to international -- or you

18

do look to international law for defining the

19

norm under which the cause of action is

20

proceeding.

21

Sosa holds

But I think Justice Alito is also

22

right, that once you have gotten past that,

23

which is not in front of the Court here, as a

24

matter of the common law-making authority to

25

manage the civil action that is the cause of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

13
1

action under the ATS, one of the touchstones

2

could be international law.

3

But if I could return to Justice

4

Alito's question, so, first of all, there's a

5

mismatch between their theory and the solution.

6

There are other doctrines more available.

7

And just imagine other situations.

8

Remember, their theory would be exactly the

9

same if it were a U.S. corporation that was a

10

defendant in this case, and, indeed, if the

11

terror attacks had occurred in the U.S.

12

talking about very serious foreign policy

13

implications at that point.

14

said, piracy, slave trading, child labor

15

practices that might occur in this country.

You're

Take also, as I

16

You have to ask yourself -­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

If it's a U.S.

18

corporation, won't there be other grounds on

19

which the suit can be brought?

20

MR. FISHER:

Well, it brings us back

21

to the purpose of the ATS.

If it's a foreign

22

plaintiff, what Congress wanted was to have

23

that case brought into federal court, if it is

24

a law of nations theory for which the violation

25

--

Heritage Reporting Corporation

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if you have a

2

foreign -- if you have a foreign plaintiff

3

suing an American corporation, that could be

4

brought in federal court, could it not?

5

MR. FISHER:

It could be brought in

6

federal court, but the law of nations theory

7

that we're proceeding under is available only

8

under the ATS.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10
11

MR. FISHER:

I mean, let's -­

Some of those cases might

-- I'm sorry.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, I'm sorry.

Let's

13

go back to 1789 and think of concrete examples.

14

So we know the example of the French, a French

15

citizen assaults a French diplomat in

16

Philadelphia.

17

There -- there could be foreign policy

18

repercussions for the United States if the

19

federal courts didn't provide a forum for that

20

suit.

21

the ATS.

22

That's said to be the thinking behind

So suppose the French diplomat is

23

assaulted by a British subject on a ship coming

24

to the United States but still in international

25

waters at the time of the -- of the assault.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

15
1

Now, would -- would the First Congress

2

have wanted that to be heard in federal court

3

where you have -- it would put us in exactly

4

the situation between these two superpowers

5

that we wanted to avoid?

6

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think, Justice

7

Alito, the answer to that question would be an

8

application of the extraterritoriality

9

doctrine.

10
11

It would not be an application of a

no corporate liability rule.
Just to return to 1789, imagine the

12

process server, which was one of the other

13

examples that gave rise to the Act, working for

14

a corporation.

15

And as the United States points out in

16

its brief, it would make no sense to have -­

17

think Congress would have thought the

18

corporation for which the process server was

19

working shouldn't be subject to suit.

20

And I know you talked to the first

21

Kiobel argument about the example of piracy,

22

and unfortunately today that's an example that

23

resounds -- that -- that -- that is important

24

not just then but today, and piracy operations

25

can be in a corporate forum.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

2

MR. FISHER:

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Fisher -­

And you have to -- yeah.
-- looking back to

4

1789, as Sosa indicates we should, beyond

5

extraterritoriality, did it also anticipate

6

that there's an American defendant in the case?

7

Professor Bellia and Clark argue that

8

that's exactly what was in mind, was some

9

action by an American citizen that might be

10

tagged to the United States itself and be cause

11

for just war by a foreign power, and that that

12

was the purpose of the ATS.

13

So what do you say about that?

And

14

then relatedly, if international law was not

15

part of the federal law itself in 1789, and I

16

think there is an argument that that's what the

17

Congress understood too, then don't you need an

18

American defendant in order to have diversity

19

jurisdiction?

20

MR. FISHER:

So -- so, to take your

21

first question, remember the De Longchamps

22

example involved two Frenchmen.

23

think, a direct refutation -­

24
25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So that's, I

Well, you've got the

ambassador provision as well, which is a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

17

separate part of the Constitution.

2

was arguably meant to do more than cover

3

ambassadors.

4

MR. FISHER:

And the ATS

Well, I think that it

5

just shows you that a foreign defendant could

6

be a problem.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But if you -- I

8

think we have a separate statute in -- in 1789

9

to deal with that issue too.

10

So that's -- that

doesn't answer my question.

11

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that, you

12

know, there are -- there have been many, many

13

examples.

14

General's example, of the irrigation company

15

that -- in 1907 that he said could be subject

16

to the ATS.

17

Another example, the Attorney

Nobody thought that was incorrect.

And there have been numerable other

18

cases with foreign defendants and foreign

19

plaintiffs.

20

concerns this country, and this is the holding

21

of Kiobel, then we think it's a proper -­

22

And as long as it touches and

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But can you answer

23

my question about what the expectation was in

24

1789 -­

25

MR. FISHER:

I think the -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- Sosa tells us it

should govern our review of the statute.

3

MR. FISHER:

The understanding I -- my

4

understanding of Congress' understanding in

5

1789 was that the international law was part of

6

U.S. law.

7

described this situation years later.

8

10

That's the way Paquete Habana

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't that what -­

what this Court said?
MR. FISHER:

I think that's right,

11

Justice Ginsburg.

And so, therefore, it would

12

have been a proper use of Congress' powers

13

under the define and punish clause.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I don't doubt that's

15

what we've -- some -- some have suggested since

16

then, but do we know that was the understanding

17

of Congress in 1789?

18

Bellia, Clark, others have argued -- Goldsmith,

19

suggested maybe otherwise.

20

MR. FISHER:

It seems like Professor

Well, I think there would

21

have been a revoke -- I'm sorry, a robust set

22

of arguments made about the history of the ATS

23

and how it should be interpreted.

24
25

Justice Gorsuch, I think those were
hashed out in Sosa.

And so I think that that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

19
1

position in Sosa didn't carry the day.

2

And what carried the day in Sosa was a

3

notion that international law was received into

this country as part of the federal common law

and, therefore, when the ATS says that causes

6

of action can be brought for violations of the

law of nations -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

If that's the case,

then -- then you've got federal question
jurisdiction and what's the point of the ATS?
MR. FISHER:

You have -- the point of

12

the ATS is to direct it to a federal forum and

13

to make clear that -- that alien plaintiffs can

14

bring these cases, and to make -- to make it

15

absolutely clear as a statutory matter that the

16

federal courts had jurisdiction as part of, as

So -­

MR. FISHER:

The same way that

22

maritime law, maritime jurisdiction, is more

23

specifically set out in the first judiciary

24

act, Congress wanted to make absolutely clear,

25

because of the history the Court has canvassed

Heritage Reporting Corporation

and that we have already discussed today, that

2

--

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

MR. FISHER:

5

You've -- you've -­

-- those were able to be

brought in federal court.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

You have referred to

7

the extraterritoriality doctrine as one that

8

would limit the application of the ATS in cases

9

that have foreign relations problems.

But I

10

don't know how much limitation that's going to

11

impose if -- if it is -- if the presumption

12

against extraterritoriality is satisfied

13

whenever a foreign financial transaction is

14

cleared through New York.

15

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Alito, of

16

course, that issue is in front of you and

17

nobody's -- and so we're not asking you to

18

resolve it and neither is the United States.

19

But I'd say two things in respect to

20

that:

if you want to think about that issue

21

for purposes of this case, the -- the amicus

22

brief on our side by former financial

23

regulators and financial regulation scholars

24

explain that dollar clearing, as the -- as the

25

function is called, is actually a core function

of finance.

2

And it's so important that the federal

3

government itself exercises jurisdiction over

4

any bank that does it and it holds it liable

5

under the Bank Secrecy Act, the Foreign Corrupt

6

Practices Act.

7

In this very case, or -- and the facts

8

giving rise to this very case, we know the

9

federal government imposed a very heavy

10

sanction on Arab Bank for using its New York

11

branch in the way it did.

12

So I would -- I would -­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

MR. FISHER:

15

I -- I am -­

-- I would push back a

little bit.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I take your point that

17

that's not in this case.

18

this case, that what you just said does raise

19

Mr. Clement's argument that there are many

20

better ways, perhaps, dealing with, you know,

21

financial regulation generally, than allowing

22

private suits to deal with those sorts of

23

issues.

24
25

MR. FISHER:

But if it were in

So, Justice Kagan, if I

may say one more thing to Justice Alito and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

22
1

then turn to that question, which is also,

2

remember, we have the money laundering

3

allegations using the bank -- using the

4

charitable front in Texas.

5

And as the United States points out,

6

that also satisfies touchy concern if that gets

7

litigated on remand.

8

Now, Justice Kagan, to turn to your

9

question, we just don't think -- it's just a

10

red herring to point to all of the various

11

banking regulations that exist in the world.

12

We're not proceeding under any banking

13

regulations.

14

You know, the bank would like to tell

15

a story to this Court about it being a

16

negligent and innocent actor in this -- in this

17

scenario, but that's not what the factual

18

allegations are and it's not even what the

19

district court has found that we proved in the

20

ATA part of this case.

21

What we allege is knowing and

22

purposeful financing of terrorism with the

23

expectation that it will make those terrorism

24

attacks more successful and more lucrative for

25

the perpetrators, and that is a violation of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

23
1

the law of nations.

2

The Court does not need to worry that

3

there is going to be a flood of lawsuits

4

against banks or any other financial actors if

5

we are allowed to go forward in this case

6

eventually on our substantive claims -­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MR. FISHER:

9
10

What -­

-- because you have to

allege a violation of the law of nations, not
of mere banking regulations.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what about

12

another limitation that has been suggested,

13

extraterritoriality, that's what this Court has

14

declared.

15

there should be an exhaustion requirement, that

16

is, you sue first in the country most

17

concerned.

18

then, if you -- if you don't have a remedy in

19

that most natural forum, then you can come

20

here.

As there's a suggestion that perhaps

You sue where this happened.

21

MR. FISHER:

22

that's an acceptable doctrine?

23
24
25

And

Are you asking me whether

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, the

exhaustion.
MR. FISHER:

Yes, I think in Footnote

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

24
1

21 in Sosa, the Court suggested that that may

2

well be a requirement for a cause of action

3

like this.

4

It doesn't apply in this case, Justice

5

Ginsburg, because the bank argued in the

6

district court only that we should have brought

7

this case in Jordan, and we responded to that

8

argument with many, many problems with that

9

suggestion.

10
11
12
13

The district court rejected it.

And the bank did not appeal that finding.
So there was no adequate forum
available to us.
And, secondly, Justice Ginsburg, it's

14

worth remembering that this case began as a

15

combined cause of action for the alien

16

plaintiffs under the ATS and for the U.S.

17

national plaintiffs under the ATA.

18

every bit of sense for efficiency concerns to

19

bring, in a single forum with a single judge,

20

these joint claims that deal with the same core

21

factual allegations.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it made

Your -- your -- the

23

theory of your case is that Sosa step 1, where

24

we ask if there's a specific universal norm, is

25

different from saying what parties are bound by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

25
1
2

that norm.
But isn't it true that with respect to

3

corporate liability, which can be strict

4

liability, vicarious liability, respondeat

5

superior, Monell, that this does impose a norm

6

in the sense that it tells corporations what

7

they must do, how they must run their business?

8

That seems to me a norm.

9

MR. FISHER:

No, I think, Justice

10

Kennedy, it's not in the -- in the Sosa sense

11

because the U.S. rule here is respondeat

12

superior and that's the rule shared by the vast

13

majority of civilized legal systems.

14

all that rule then tells you to ask is, who's

15

responsible for the bad acts here?

16

matter of -­

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And then

So it's a

No, but -- but norms

18

control behavior.

19

corporations with this extensive liability

20

under respondeat superior now must conform

21

their behavior.

22

And we're saying that

That seems to me to be a norm.

MR. FISHER:

Justice Kennedy, I think

23

there are other things that might influence the

24

way a corporation acts.

25

rules of evidence that will apply in any course

Limitations periods,

going to influence corporate behavior does not

So just the mere fact that it's

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

5

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

6

IN SUPPORT OF NEITHER PARTY

7
8
9

MR. FLETCHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
In the government's view, for some of

10

the reasons that Justice Alito alluded to

11

earlier, there's a serious question whether the

12

claims in this case have a sufficient

13

connection to the United States to proceed in

14

U.S. court under the Alien Tort Statute.

15

the court of appeals did not reach that

16

important extraterritoriality question because

17

it -- because it relied on its rule that a

18

corporation can never be a defendant in an

19

Alien Tort Statute case.

20

But

And in our view, that categorical rule

21

is wrong, and the Second Circuit reached the

22

wrong result because it looked to the wrong

23

source of law.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Fletcher,

could you answer the beginning question on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

28
1

implications of a holding in this case in the

2

Petitioners' favor?

3

about the international -- the impact on

4

international relations?

Why are you less worried

5

MR FLETCHER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7
8
9

Because -­
Your adversaries

are telling us that we should be worried.
MR. FLETCHER:

They are right, and I

think they are absolutely correct that ATS

10

litigation in recent decades has raised

11

international friction, indeed as this case has

12

raised international friction.

13

view, the way to deal with that friction is

14

with a doctrine that speaks directly to the

15

international entanglement,

16

extraterritoriality, as this Court did in

17

Kiobel and as it can further do as those -- as

18

those questions arise.

But in our

19

But I think one way to illustrate that

20

point is to ask whether this case would produce

21

less international friction if it had been

22

brought against the high-ranking officers and

23

employees of the bank rather than against the

24

bank itself.

25

would still have some degree of international

And I think the answer is you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

29
1

friction if you had suits against corporate

2

officers and employees.

3

And what that tells you is that the

4

way to deal with international friction is by

5

carefully defining, as this Court had begun to

6

do already in Kiobel, the types of violations

7

that are remediable, but I think once you have

8

a remediable violation, that's really the way

9

we view the question here, that however -­

10
11
12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
sorry.

If it -- I'm

Please finish.
MR. FLETCHER:

I was just going to say

13

we answer the question here by saying, once

14

you've carefully defined those violations of

15

the law of nations that ought to give rise to a

16

remedy in U.S. courts, what should the scope of

17

that remedy be, and when you view it in that

18

lens, we don't see a sound reason to

19

categorically exclude corporate liability.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think this

21

might be a question along the same lines.

22

page 7 of your brief, if I could just read one

23

sentence, you say that "the function of the ATS

24

is to ensure private damages remedies in

25

circumstances where other nations might hold

Heritage Reporting Corporation

On

Official

30
1

the United States accountable if it did not

2

provide a remedy."

3

Who's going to hold us accountable,

4

what other nations, in this case, if we didn't

5

provide a remedy?

6
7

MR. FLETCHER:

-- we don't see a reason, and again -­

8
9
10

Well, I think there's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me

the other nations are holding us accountable
for providing a remedy.

11

MR. FLETCHER:

And that's why we say

12

at the tail end of our brief that we have

13

serious questions about whether or not this

14

case belongs in U.S. court precisely because it

15

is extraterritorial potentially.

16

haven't expressed a definitive view on that

17

because parts of the record are sealed.

18

understand the principal connection to the U.S.

19

to be the clearing of dollar-denominated

20

transactions through New York, and we've taken

21

the view that that's not sufficient to displace

22

the presumption against extraterritoriality

23

here.

Again, we

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if we -­

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So in what -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But we

Official

31

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we follow your

2

recommendation and we remand this to the Second

3

Circuit, and the Second Circuit holds, as it

4

may very well in light of its precedents, that

5

there is no extraterritoriality problem here,

6

then what happens?

7

trial before the -- the issue can be brought

8

here again?

9
10

Then there has to be a

MR. FLETCHER:

Can I say two things

about that?

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

MR. FLETCHER:

Yes.
I think the first one

13

would be if the Second Circuit did that, there

14

would be another opportunity for review in this

15

Court.

And also to your point about -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

MR. FLETCHER:

At what point?
I would think, if on

18

remand the Second Circuit issues another

19

decision deciding the extraterritoriality

20

issue, Mr. Clement would be back here with

21

another cert petition asking for review of that

22

question once it had been decided by the Second

23

Circuit.

24
25

But I also -- I think your point about
Second Circuit precedent speaks to the case

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

32
1

that Mr. Clement cites at the end of his brief,

2

the Licci decision.

3

about that is that that also involved

4

allegations about clearing transactions through

5

New York and the Second Circuit, a panel of it,

6

stated that that was sufficient to overcome the

7

presumption against extraterritoriality.

But the observation I make

8

I think everyone, though, agrees that

9

that was dicta because the case was ultimately

10

dismissed on corporate liability grounds.

11

I think also it's important to remember that

12

there's a petition for certiorari pending in

13

that case, and if this Court were to agree with

14

us that the corporate liability rule is wrong

15

and remand, it would presumably vacate that

16

decision and clear the way for the panel in

17

this case to consider the issue afresh.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

If I could go back to

19

the Chief Justice's question, so in what kind

20

of case involving a corporate defendant would

21

another country hold us accountable if we

22

didn't provide a remedy?

23

MR. FLETCHER:

I think the classic

24

ones are the ones that this Court suggested in

25

Kiobel, or sort of the heartland of what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

33
1

Congress had in mind when it enacted the

2

statute, which was foreign officials injured in

3

the United States.

4

We know from the history that led up

5

to the enactment of the statute, Marbois, in

6

the 1787 incident involving the Dutch

7

ambassador, that those sorts of violations

8

could give rise to international friction and

9

that the purpose, as this Court said, was to

10

provide an adequate remedy, a federal forum and

11

an adequate remedy for those individuals, to

12

avoid the possibility of friction.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So what you're saying

14

is that in those sorts of classic cases, why

15

would the foreign government care that the

16

perpetrator was a corporation rather than an

17

individual?

18

MR. FLETCHER:

And, if anything, I

19

think it cuts the other way because I think

20

because, as we point out, tort remedies always

21

in virtually all circumstances include the

22

possibility of recovering from the corporate

23

employer when a corporation commits the tort.

24

We think actually there's the possibility of

25

friction or at least defeating the purpose of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

34
1

providing an adequate remedy if you say, in

2

this class of tort cases, you do not get that

3

normal tort remedy.

4

would be very odd to say that when the whole

5

point of the statute, at least as we understand

6

it and as the Court has understood it, is to

7

provide an additional forum.

8
9

We think, in fact, it

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And, counsel, might

that be because it's a -- an American defendant

10

against whom the United States might be

11

chargeable for a just war?

12

you say to that scholarship that suggests that

13

that's the key to the idea of -- of what causes

14

friction and alien versus alien causes of

15

action aren't within the statute?

16

MR. FLETCHER:

Wasn't -- what do

I think that I'd give

17

at least to the first line the same answer that

18

Mr. Fisher did, which is that that's a little

19

tough to reconcile with the Marbois incident -­

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21

MR. FLETCHER:

Well -­

-- which involved a

22

tort by an alien and which certainly did give

rise to quite a lot of international -­

bunch of really interesting scholarship on this

point, and I'm just wondering what -- what the

12

government's point of view is on it.

13

MR. FLETCHER:

I think the

14

government's point of view is that that is not

15

the understanding of the statute that we

16

understand this Court to have taken in Sosa or

17

Kiobel in part because, in both of those cases,

18

you had aliens on both sides.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

though, and -- and I don't think it's been

foreclosed necessarily either.

23

certainly true we took the view that courts in

America can apply general international law,

25

sure, but I'm not sure it's -- it's addressed

I mean, it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

36
1

this specific theory of the ATS.

2

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I -- there's sort

3

of two different theories that are alluded to

4

in the scholarship that you're referring to.

5

agree with you that Sosa didn't consider the

6

specific argument.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. FLETCHER:

9

Okay.

That it's only alien -­

or U.S. defendants.

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

11

MR. FLETCHER:

Right.

That wasn't addressed.

12

Sosa did, though, address what I think is the

13

other strand, which is what is the -­

14
15

I

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, if it didn't

address that one, what do you say to it?

16

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I say to it, I

17

think, where I started, which is under that

18

theory, the ATS would not have provided a

19

remedy for the Marbois incident or for another

20

similar incident.

21

that -­

22
23
24
25

And I take your point

JUSTICE GORSUCH:
statute that does.

But there's another

So -- so what?

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I think this

Court has certainly understood the Marbois

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

37
1

incident as a key to interpreting what Congress

2

was trying to accomplish in the Alien Tort

3

Statute.

4

I think it illustrates even if that

5

particular assault in -- on ambassadors might

6

have been remediable under another statute, it

7

illustrates the point that foreign nations

8

didn't observe the limitation that Your Honor

9

is suggesting.

10

They didn't only hold us accountable

11

when bad things were done to their nationals or

12

their officials that are U.S. citizens.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But it might explain

14

why this statute exists in addition to that

15

other one.

16

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I guess the other

17

one involves all, I think -- I don't remember

18

exactly how the Judiciary Act of 1789 was

19

worded, but -­

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. FLETCHER:

-- certainly there's

some jurisdiction over all causes involving

And I -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Fletcher, can -­

unless you're -­

11

MR. FLETCHER:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, please.
Just a different kind

13

of question, which is you are here saying there

14

shouldn't be an automatic bar against corporate

15

liability.

16

MR. FLETCHER:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's right.
But I wonder if you

18

have any view -- and if not, just say no -- as

19

to what the scope of corporate liability might

20

be.

21

In other words, some folks have said,

22

well, in this context, corporate liability

23

might be only available for actions that were

24

directed at high levels of the corporation as

25

opposed to anything that any old employee of a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

39
1

corporation did.

2
3

And I'm wondering whether you've
thought through that question.

4

MR. FLETCHER:

We haven't taken a view

5

on it.

6

that view that I'm aware of is Judge Posner's

7

opinion for the Seventh Circuit in Flomo where

8

he made that suggestion.

9

I think the most prominent advocate of

The one thing I would say about that

10

actually is that I understand his opinion to be

11

suggesting that that more limited version of

12

corporate liability would be appropriate in

13

large part because he assumed that this statute

14

applied extraterritorially, and he was

15

concerned about holding the corporation liable

16

for something that happened at some far-flung

17

office and wanted to make sure that there was

18

appropriately high level accountability before

19

imposing liability.

20

And, obviously, this Court's decision

21

in Kiobel cuts back on that concern because it

22

makes clear that the claims have to actually

23

touch and concern the United States, and so it

24

might alter the analysis there.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did he -- did

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

40
1
2

he cite legal authority for that proposition?
MR. FLETCHER:

I think -- I can't

3

remember whether he cited it or not.

4

the Court has also limited the scope of

5

respondeat superior under Section 1983 in the

6

Monell decision.

7

where corporate liability has been limited.

8
9

I know

So there are circumstances

But, certainly, I think for present
purposes, all we're asking the Court to do and

10

all the Court needs to do is say there is no

11

categorical bar on corporate liability.

12

And if I could, just before my time

13

runs, I do want to turn to what the

14

government's other important interest in this

15

case, which is that if the Court agrees with us

16

that the corporate liability bar is incorrect

17

and sends the case back down for further

18

proceedings, we think, we'd urge the Court to

19

indicate in its opinion that the Second Circuit

20

ought to address what we regard as a very

21

serious extraterritoriality issue promptly on

22

remand because this case has been a source of

23

international friction and because if that

24

important issue isn't resolved quickly, there

25

may be more international friction from a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case arises out of a suit by

10

Israeli nationals against a corporation

11

chartered in Jordan for injuries suffered in

12

Israel and the adjoining territories.

13

The defendant is not just chartered by

14

the Kingdom of Jordan but it's closely

15

regulated by Jordan and its central bank.

16

there are a host of problems with this lawsuit,

17

not the least of which is there is nothing

18

approaching a specific universal obligatory

19

norm under international law that imposes

20

obligations directly on corporations.

21

Now,

And try as they might, the other side

22

really can't deny that basic reality.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's no

24

international norm that makes people civilly

25

liable for international torts.

There's never

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

42
1

been an international court that has held an

2

individual responsible.

3

The norm is the conduct, i.e., should

4

you be financing terrorists or not?

Should you

5

commit piracy or not?

6

slavery, genocide, any of the other prohibited

7

international acts against humanity?

Should you commit

8

MR. CLEMENT:

But just -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, if there's no

10

civil liability, international civil liability

11

for an individual, was the ATS a violation of

12

that norm, of the norm you're trying to create

13

that doesn't exist?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

No, but, Justice

15

Sotomayor, I think it's critical that in your

16

various formulations, international law does

17

speak to who is the "you."

18

that can violate international law?

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Who is the actor

You or you or you

20

the state or you as an individual.

21

individual -­

22

MR. CLEMENT:

But the

Or you the artificial

23

juridical entity.

And there is a body of

24

international law that speaks specifically to

25

that both in the criminal context and the civil

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

43
1

liability context.

2

there anything approaching a universal

3

obligatory norm.

4

And in neither context is

JUSTICE BREYER:

When you say that, I

5

assumed, I take as a given, the statement in

6

Sosa, does international law extend the scope

7

of liability for a violation of a given norm to

8

the perpetrator being sued, if the defendant is

9

a private actor, such as a corporation or

10

individual?

11

addressing.

That's the question you're

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then I've assumed, as

14

it was brought out, that, in fact, if a private

15

person struck the French ambassador in the

16

street, as a matter to disgrace him, knocked

17

away his cane, that the statute was passed to

18

give the French ambassador a cause of action

19

against that private person.

20

So we know that sometimes the norm,

21

even though it addresses what the state's

22

supposed to do directly, is also telling the

23

private actor not to do it, it's close enough.

24

Now, when you look at this case, what

25

they've cited is, for example, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

44
1

International Convention for the Suppression of

2

the Financing of Terrorism, which we've

3

ratified, which says that states must take

4

necessary measures to enable a legal entity

5

located in its territory or organized under its

6

laws to be held liable.

7

That sounds like a corporation.

And

8

it sounds like the relation is the same as the

9

international norm to the individual who struck

10

the French ambassador in the street.

11

And then, similarly, the U.N. Security

12

Council has required states to prohibit persons

13

and entities within their territory from

14

financing terrorism.

15

those through the Anti-Terrorism Act.

16

there are other states that have incorporated

17

it.

18

Then we've implemented
And

And there are other examples.

So,

19

when you say there is no such example, it

20

seemed to me that the briefs are full of

21

examples that are designed to make the point

22

that the relationship between the corporation

23

and the international norm is the same as the

24

relationship between the private individual who

25

struck the French ambassador and the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

45
1

international law at that time.

2

Now, what is your response?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I have multiple

4

responses, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, starting

5

with the concern in 1789 was that some

6

individual might strike the French ambassador.

7

There wasn't a concern that some

8

artificial juridical entity would rise up and

9

strike the ambassador and then the question

10

would arise -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, really, but why

12

would it have mattered?

13

a corporation that had a beef about the

14

ambassador and sent one of its employees to go

15

strike the ambassador and sent a judgment-proof

16

employee to go strike the ambassador.

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Suppose that there was

19
20

Why would France have

cared?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think France

21

would care that there would be some entity -­

22

some individual, probably the actual

23

tort-feasor, which in that case would be the

24

individual who could be held responsible.

25

And, of course, Congress had a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

46
1

provision for the judgment-proof tort-feasor,

2

which they also in the Crimes Act of 1790 made

3

it a criminal act.

4

to recognize -­

5

And I think it's important

JUSTICE BREYER:

But this Court's

6

person -- this Court's case, which I tend to

7

think is precedent, says person or entity.

8

the -- the norms that I read to you say person

9

or entity.

And

10

And if it were an American

11

corporation, I can't imagine why, if it fell

12

within the international norm, you would free

13

it of liability.

14

the question I raised to say corporations are

15

never liable, given that precedent?

16

So -- so how does it answer

MR. CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice

17

Breyer, I don't think under Sosa my burden is

18

to show that they're never liable.

19

-- the burden is on the other side to show a

20

specific obligatory universal norm of corporate

21

liability.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

completely agree.

24

what are -­

25

Exactly right.

I agree.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

My burden

I

Now, given that,

I don't agree.

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4
5

But -­
I just want to be

sure I get an answer to the second part.
MR. CLEMENT:

And -- and -- and what I

6

would tell you is there is nothing approaching

7

that, and I would start with, though, I would

8

like to, if I could, go through the criminal

9

provisions and the civil liability efforts

10

under other treaties, but I'd start with the

11

financing convention.

12

And I would tell you it's very

13

important to read Article II and Article V in

14

contradistinction with each other.

15

will see that they are very different.

16

2, Article II makes it unlawful as a matter of

17

international law, imposes a duty on a person.

18

And you
Section

It doesn't define person, but then, if

19

you look at Article V, it's crystal clear that

20

the persons in Article II do not include legal

21

entities that are addressed separately in

22

Article V.

23

And Article V is different.

It

24

doesn't impose any direct international law

25

obligation on the legal entity.

It tells the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

48

countries -­

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's not -- Mr.

3

Clement, but you -- you are asserting that

4

international law doesn't operate against

5

corporations, but neither does it operate

6

against individuals.

7

that supplies the remedy.

8
9

It's the national law

MR. CLEMENT:
Ginsburg.

I disagree, Justice

I think there's a tremendous

10

difference between how international law

11

operates on natural persons and how it operates

12

on legal entities.

13

And -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you give an

14

example?

15

draws the distinction between individuals and

16

corporations as far as liability for a

17

violation of the law of nations?

18

Is there any place in the world that

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

One place I could

19

start with is the Torture Victim Protection

20

Act, which is the only statute this country has

21

ever passed specifically with the idea that it

22

was enforcement of 1350.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

That has -­

24

that's thinking of a torture, like the

25

Filartiga case.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

49

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely it is.

But

that's an example of where this nation -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, I mean, you -­

4

you said that international law doesn't

5

recognize corporate liability.

6

United States, a specific statute, Congress can

7

make an individual corporation, whatever it

8

likes, but in -- elsewhere in the world, is

9

there a distinction made between individuals

10

and corporations when the international norm

11

applies to private persons?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

And so not the

Yes, absolutely.

And, I

13

mean, you know, you could start with Nuremberg

14

and then you can go to all the international

15

criminal tribunals that have been set up,

16

whether for Yugoslavia, Rwanda, or the Rome

17

statute, all of them have made a judgment that

18

individuals -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Clement, there

20

were scholars here who pointed out that

21

criminal law is different than civil, and the

22

brief that was cited by Mr. Fisher points out

23

that there are many, many nations that hold

24

individuals and corporations civilly liable for

25

violations of the international norms.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

50
1

So where do we find international

2

norms, if not in the behavior of international

3

companies -- of international countries?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

Well, I -­
Don't they show us

what the norm is?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think there is a

8

norm to hold corporations liable for violations

9

of international law, especially under

10

jurisdictional circumstances like this where

11

the United States is a stranger to the dispute.

12

But I do want to make clear, and I

13

want to come back if I get a chance to say why

14

the criminal provisions are highly relevant.

15

But it's not like international law hasn't

16

thought about the idea of imposing civil

17

liability directly on corporations as a matter

18

of international law.

19

There are six treaties that purport to

20

do that.

They're collected in Footnote 40 of

21

Judge Cabranes's opinion at 116(a) of the

22

petition appendix.

23

impose corporate liability directly -- civil

24

corporate liability directly under

25

international law.

All six of those treaties

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

51
1

What is so telling about those six

2

treaties is that the United States has signed

3

exactly none of them.

4

And so I think when you are looking

5

under Sosa for a universal obligatory and

6

specific norm, one of the first things you look

7

to is whether this is so well established -­

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I -­
-- that the United

10

States signs some of the treaties and the idea

11

-- I mean, six treaties that the United States

12

hasn't signed doesn't get it done.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement, I think

14

the reason I said I don't agree before is

15

because, when you're talking about a standard

16

of conduct under Sosa, it's clear that you have

17

to find this universal body of law.

18

But that's different from enforcement

19

mechanisms.

It's different -- you know, we

20

have the ATS.

21

things.

22

Nobody -- so, as to enforcement, I mean,

23

where -- where do you get the understanding

24

that that's a question where all countries have

25

to agree to the same thing?

Other countries have different

Nobody requires an ATS-like provision.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

52
1

MR. CLEMENT:

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well -­
As far as I understood

3

your brief, you're only getting it from that

4

Sosa Footnote 20, which really does not make

5

that point at all.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

No, but, Justice Kagan,

7

as you yourself pointed out in the first

8

argument in Kiobel, if the footnote does

9

specifically look to international law to

10

figure out whether non-state actors are

11

covered, it's a little odd that it wouldn't

12

also look to international law to address the

13

question of whether artificial juridical

14

individuals or entities are covered by the

15

norm.

16

So I do think the logic of what got

17

the Court to where it did extends here, but I

18

have other answers too, which is I think that

19

it's -­

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Look, I agree that

21

there should be some understanding -- some

22

notions of, you know, what do other countries

23

do and is this likely to get us into trouble

24

with other countries or not.

25

should come into play at some point when we're

I mean, that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

53
1

trying to figure out what kind of claims to

2

accept.

3

with that.

4

And I think even Mr. Fisher agrees

I don't think we have to ask about,

5

you know, is it a uniform norm that every

6

country accepts, but, rather, we have a set of

7

rules under our domestic system which does hold

8

corporations accountable.

9

And if we use that as the typical

10

enforcement mechanism, is that going to get us

11

into trouble with other foreign countries?

Is

12

it going to create international friction?

And

13

it seems to me that that's the level at which

14

all these international/foreign relations

15

concerns come into play.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

See, and I would

17

disagree with you there.

18

sound sort of Chevron-esque here, but I think

19

the question is, do you look at that at step 1

20

or do you look at it at step 2?

21
22
23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I don't want to

Yes, I think that

that's the question.
MR. CLEMENT:

And I think it's

24

important, because I think it's pretty clear,

25

and this is presumably why you disagreed with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

54
1

me, but I think it's pretty clear that at step

2

1 the burden is on my friends to show that it's

3

a universal, specific, obligatory norm of

4

international law -­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, see, that would

6

suggest that all enforcement mechanisms have to

7

be the same worldwide.

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

And they just don't.
See, I would take issue

with the premise of your question that the

10

extent of corporate liability is just an

11

enforcement question.

12

actually right.

13

I don't think that's

If you look at what they cite in their

14

brief, they don't cite the restatement of

15

remedies.

16

and torts.

17
18
19
20

They cite the restatement of agency

So it's certainly substantive law.

I

don't -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about foreign

relations?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

What's that?

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. CLEMENT:

How about -­

And foreign relations,

24

sure, but not -- but not remedies.

25

remedial question.

It's not a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

55
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But doesn't that -­

2

doesn't -- doesn't that restatement recognize

3

that there can be corporate liability for a

4

violation -- for engaging in conduct that

5

violates international law?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think that the

7

restatement says that certainly at the level of

8

specificity and university -- universality

9

required by Sosa.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think that

11

joint and several liability -- I mean, that's

12

also an American concept, would that have to be

13

accepted by every country in the world?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't know that it

15

would, because I think the concept of joint and

16

several liability might get you closer to a

17

remedial question.

18

I do think whether or not a

19

corporation is directly liable under

20

international law is a question that should be

21

answered at step 1.

22

to recognize that if you say corporations are

23

liable, then you sort of have to answer the

24

question of, well, how?

25

And I think it's important

And on that, it's not just Judge

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

56
1

Posner, if you look at the financing

2

convention, this is the other thing that's very

3

interesting about Article V of the financing

4

convention, and the relevant part is on page 31

5

of the red brief, but it actually addresses the

6

circumstances in which a corporation could be

7

liable under domestic law for a terrorist

8

financed violation and it does not apply the

9

American concept of respondeat superior, such

10

that the master is responsible for every act of

11

the agent within the scope of agency.

12

Instead, it specifies that it is only

13

-- their own -- other countries are only

14

supposed to impose liability when someone in a

15

control or management position commits one of

16

the primary violations under Article II of the

17

convention.

18
19

So that's not an American conception
of corporate liability.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Is this -­

It does show that

22

international obligations speak to these

23

questions.

24

anything like the kind of universality and

25

specificity that I thought this Court required.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, all right.

2

quite agree with you.

footnote.

4

pointing to six treaties that we didn't, nor

5

others didn't sign.

6

I

I looked at the

And you can't get very far by

But let's look at what we did sign.

7

And what we did sign were the two I mentioned.

8

And not only -- well, there are three things.

9

One, we signed those.

Two, we've implemented

10

those.

We've implemented those by saying that

11

it is unlawful for corporations to finance

12

terrorism.

13

international law that said you cannot finance

14

terrorists, who do you think it would apply to?

15

And, three, if you had a rule of

I mean, maybe it applies to a few

16

billionaires, but, I mean, other than that, if

17

it doesn't apply to corporations, who does it

18

apply to?

19

So, I mean, you have those three

20

things that I think argue that in this case,

21

this provision of international law does seem

22

-- and you want to say no, that's wrong,

23

because -­

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Because you start with

the fact that the convention itself doesn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

58
1

impose the international law obligation itself.

2

It leaves it to domestic law.

3

Now, you're right, we passed a statute

4

that provides a remedy, the ATA.

We went out

5

of our way to limit the scope of plaintiffs

6

under the ATA to U.S. nationals.

7

helps eliminate friction with other countries

8

because it's an understandable norm of

9

international law that we have a special

And that

10

relationship with our own nationals, so, of

11

course, we want to provide a remedy to them

12

when they're victims of terrorism, even if

13

they're injured abroad, we want to do that.

14

So all of those are reasons that I

15

think very much cut against doing this under

16

the ATS.

17

And let me tell you in -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you -- are you

18

-- are you saying that under the ATS, a U.S.

19

corporation would be liable?

20

were taking the position that categorically

21

corporations are out, it's only individuals.

I thought you

22

MR. CLEMENT:

No, it's -- I -- I may

23

have misspoken in my acronyms.

24

corporations are proper defendants under the

25

ATA, the statute that was provided.

U.S.

The ATA

Heritage Reporting Corporation

remedy, though, is specifically limited to U.S.

national plaintiffs.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

corporation?

8

Under the ATS, we would

say that no corporation is liable.

6

Yes.

MR. CLEMENT:

Not a U.S. corporation.

And we would say that actually makes sense

because if there are agents of the U.S.

economy is being called a -- not just a

13

questions, Your Honor -- points to make about

14

this:

15

Sosa, the idea of the ATS is that not just that

16

you violated a statute but that you have

17

violated some specific universal obligatory

18

norm so you are essentially an enemy of

19

mankind.

one is, I mean, as this Court said in

20

So, as much as my clients would not

21

like to be an ATA defendant, they would really,

22

really, really not like to be -­

mankind.

lawsuit, which I think you have plenty of

5

things to gripe about in this lawsuit.

6

You know, there's a lot in this

I guess the question is, do you have

7

something to gripe about as to this particular

8

point, which is corporate versus individual

9

liability?

10
11

And so just -- just assume a

different lawsuit.
So there is an American corporation.

12

So the defendant is an American corporation,

13

and it uses slave labor, and it uses slave

14

labor of people in the United States, all the

15

work is done in the United States, the activity

16

is in the United States, of a particular

17

nationality.

18

these people come thinks that this is a pretty

19

awful thing.

20

And -- and the country from which

And -- and you're saying that there

21

shouldn't be ATS liability against the

22

corporation in that circumstance even though

23

they are using slave labor, clearly violating

24

an international norm, even though in our

25

domestic system, the manner of -- the method of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

enforcement we usually use is corporate

2

liability, and even though this is a case in

3

which the other country thinks who cares if

4

it's a corporation.

able to recover.

6

We want our people to be

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Kagan, of

7

course, that's a tough hypo, but the answer to

8

the tough hypo is there's absolutely no

9

obstacle to use the ATS to sue all of the

10

individuals that took the action, and if you

11

sue the individuals, you are certainly going to

12

make us accountable to the foreign government

13

--

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

have very much money.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

They happen not to

But -- well, actually,

17

people who work, especially in management

18

positions in corporations, tend to have a fair

19

amount of money.

20

that scenario, in your hypothetical, you're

21

going to find plenty of deep-pocketed

22

defendants.

23

And so I think you are, in

You're not going to have the mens rea

24

requirement problems, which is why all of these

25

corporate entities have been left out of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

63
1

international criminal tribunals, and those

2

same mens rea problems apply absolutely the

3

same in an intentional tort like this.

4

So you're going to -- my humble point

5

to you is, yeah, at first blush it might seem a

6

little weird that the U.S. corporation is not a

7

defendant, but there are plenty of other

8

potential U.S. defendants that will avoid the

9

diplomatic friction.

10

And then the costs on the other side

11

of allowing the foreign corporations to be

12

sued, if you applied the same logic here, this

13

suit wouldn't happen.

14

If you actually limited this to the

15

people who are actually liable under -- under

16

Article V of the financing convention, people

17

in management or control positions, all of

18

those people are in Jordan.

19

forum here is the question presented.

20

also integral to all of these problems.

So the corporate
It's

21

It's not an accident that it was -­

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, Mr. Clement -­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It is the question.

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- in the -- in the

25

slavery hypothetical, wouldn't that be a felony

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

64
1

under federal law?

2

who were victimized have numerous other

3

opportunities, numerous other ways to sue this

4

American corporation for these torts?

5
6

Wouldn't the individuals

MR. CLEMENT:
Alito.

Absolutely, Justice

7

But they would also -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, the individuals

8

also care if it's a felony.

9

little bit of compensation.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

They would like a

Exactly.

And that's why

11

I did want to answer, Justice Kagan, even on

12

the terms of the ATS, there would still be

13

defendants here in America that could bring -­

14

that could be proper defendants in those

15

actions.

16

-- I don't think I'm going to get a chance to

17

say, but there is a lot to the argument that

18

alien diversity doesn't exist.

19

They would be U.S. citizens.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm not

I guess one of the

20

things that I'm suggesting, Mr. Clement, and

21

this is reflected in your brief, you spend a

22

lot of time essentially saying that this is one

23

of those foreign cubed cases that we dealt with

24

in Kiobel.

25

And that might be right.

But the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

65
1

question of corporate versus individual

2

liability is a question that's entirely

3

orthogonal to that, I mean, that you can come

4

up with a very, very domestic-looking suit that

5

raises the question of corporate versus

6

individual liability and that that suit, when

7

you focus on it, leads you to say, why on earth

8

would you draw a distinction of this kind?

9

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Kagan, that's a

10

great word, but I don't think it describes the

11

relationship between corporate liability and

12

these extraterritorial suits.

13

I don't think it's an accident that

14

each time you get one of these foreign cubed

15

cases, that it's a foreign corporation, I don't

16

think it's an accident that each time it comes

17

up, it's really attractive to maybe duck the

18

corporate liability question and decide the

19

extraterritoriality question.

20

First of all, thank goodness we don't

21

really have a lot of U.S. corporations that are

22

violating international law right here in

23

America, but if they did, there would be plenty

24

of defendants under the ATS and under other

25

provisions.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

66
1

So the real incidence of this, the

2

real impact of corporate liability is the

3

ability to get a company -- a corporation like

4

Arab Bank that's a cornerstone of the Jordanian

5

economy, and you get them in here, you cause

6

all sorts of diplomatic friction and then, as a

7

bonus, you don't have to worry about whether

8

the -- the mens rea of somebody in Jordan and

9

the mens rea of somebody who processed the

10

transaction in the United States, whether any

11

of those actually satisfied the requirements of

12

the tort, because you can mush them all

13

together and say it's corporate responsibility.

14
15

That's why these are so attractive.
That's why -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. CLEMENT:

19

There was -­

-- this issue has

arisen.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was some

20

substantial -- there was a substantial sanction

21

against this bank, wasn't there?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24
25

There was.
On the part of the

U.S. Government?
MR. CLEMENT:

There was, which just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

shows that there's only a toehold of U.S.

2

concern here, which is the dollar clearing

3

transactions in the United States.

4

is a far, far better way for the law to address

5

that concern than with a 33-word jurisdictional

6

statute passed in 1789.

7

And there

And that's really what this comes down

8

to at the end of the day.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank

Thank you,

counsel.
Four minutes, Mr. Fisher.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

I'd like to

19

turn to questions three Justices have asked,

20

starting with Justice Kennedy, your question to

21

me towards the end of my time about whether

22

corporate liability falls on the conduct or

23

enforcement side, and try to make two

24

additional points about that.

25

First of all, the Bormes case, which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

68
1

is cited in the Solicitor General's brief

2

dealing with the Little Tucker Act a few years

3

ago, free and clear of all of the

4

extraterritoriality concerns and everything

5

else, just this Court straightforwardly said -­

6

citing the provision there that said who could

7

be sued, that that was part of the remedial

8

structure of the Little Tucker Act.

9

And we think that makes sense because

10

that is at the heart of the notion of corporate

11

personhood.

12

again is that part of the corporate bargain is

13

that you get privileges and opportunities, but

14

you also have burdens of being held liable in

15

tort actions.

16

What the Court has said time and

One additional thing on that, I think

17

it's important to point you to the Anti-

18

terrorism Act.

19

Anti-Terrorism Act applies to U.S. citizens and

20

not to aliens.

21

Mr. Clement is right that the

But the reason why, and this is laid

22

out in the amicus brief from former

23

counter-terrorism officials, is because

24

Congress knew that aliens already had a cause

25

of action under the ATS.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

69
1

And, indeed, Congress made clear in

2

the ATA that it was exercising its power under

3

the define and punish clause.

4

Congress understood to be codifying a cause of

5

action for a violation of international law

6

and, as my opponent even concedes, in one that

7

swept in corporations.

8
9

And so the

Mr. Chief Justice, you asked about
accountability of the United States in the

10

history of the Alien Tort Statute.

11

to make sure the Court remembers that piracy is

12

one of the quintessential concerns Congress had

13

in mind.

14

than simply another country taking us to war.

15

I just want

And that's a little bit different

That was a notion that certain conduct

16

makes somebody an enemy of all mankind.

17

you take that concern of piracy historically

18

and compare it to terrorism today, we think the

19

parallels are quite obvious.

20

And if

And even if we had to prove that this

21

is a situation where some other country would

22

be mad, imagine Israel's view if our

23

financing -- if our entire finance system could

24

be used and accessed to combat -- to commit

25

terrorist attacks, make them easier, make them

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

70
1

more deadly, make the funding more effective.

2

Israel, if the -- if suits like this

3

were taken away, Israel and countries like it

4

might well have a complaint to the United

5

States.

6

And finally, Justice Gorsuch, I wanted

7

to turn back to your question about the history

8

and make two additional points.

9

One is piracy, as Justice Sotomayor

10

pointed out, I think also is a very difficult

11

thing to account for under the theory you've

12

described.

13
14

Secondly, I would just bring you back
to the ordinary -­

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

16

MR. FISHER:

But why is that?

Because pirates wouldn't

17

be -- they wouldn't be citizens of the United

18

States.

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.

But if -- if

20

we're not responsible for it, it wouldn't be

21

the cause of a just war against us and,

22

therefore, not a cause of concern under the

23

ATS.

24
25

MR. FISHER:

No, but -- but that

brings me back to my other point.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

71
1
2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Oh, good.

So the

first one we can put aside.

3

MR. FISHER:

No, no, no, well, I -­

4

piracy is something that doesn't exactly fall

5

under the same rubric.

6

I would just point you to the plain text of the

7

act.

8
9
10

But the second point is

And as we've pointed out quite clearly
in our brief, Congress went out of its way to
specify aliens as proper plaintiffs.

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

12

MR. FISHER:

As plaintiffs, yes.

Yes, yes, but if Congress

13

was so careful to do that, if it had wanted

14

only U.S. nationals to be defendants, you have

15

to ask the question why Congress wouldn't have

16

been specific on the other side.

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And the argument I

18

have been developing isn't mine.

19

credit for it.

20

MR. FISHER:

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I can't take

Yeah.
But it's a very

22

careful argument that has been developed that

23

that is exactly what those words meant to the

24

First Congress.

25

MR. FISHER:

No, but I think that, as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

72
1

the Court said in Amerada Hess, Congress did

2

not limit the scope of defendants.

3

if you look at the rest of the Judiciary Act,

4

other provisions we point out in our brief did

5

limit the scope of proper defendants.

6

And, again,

So who was a proper plaintiff and who

7

was a proper defendant in the jurisdictional

8

provisions Congress was creating was very much

9

at the center of Congress's mind.

And so we

10

think the plain text, if nothing else, answers

11

that.

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.

But -- but

13

the plain text is the law of nations.

14

argument, and I'm not doing it justice -­

15

MR. FISHER:

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And the

Yeah.
-- but is briefly

17

that a law of nations would have meant

18

something that would have been attributed to

19

the United States.

20

would have been attributable to the United

21

States is an act by a U.S. citizen.

22

And the only thing that

MR. FISHER:

Well, on that level, we

23

simply disagree with the concept of law of

24

nations.

25

nations deals with the conduct, not the

As has been pointed out, law of

Heritage Reporting Corporation
