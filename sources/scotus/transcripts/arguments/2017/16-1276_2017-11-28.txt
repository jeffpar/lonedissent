Mr. Shanmugam.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

The Dodd-Frank Act provides incentives

12

to and protections for whistleblowers; that is,

13

individuals who have reported securities law

14

violations to the SEC.

15

The question presented in this case is

16

whether the statutory definition of

17

whistleblower applies to the subsection of the

18

statute that protects whistleblowers from

19

retaliation for engaging in certain types of

20

conduct.

21

The answer to that question is yes.

22

By its plain terms, the statutory definition

23

applies to the entirety of the section,

24

including the anti-retaliation provision.

25

from being absurd, that plain text

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Far

Official
4
1

interpretation is entirely consistent with the

2

history and the structure of the whistleblower

3

provisions and with Congress's overarching

4

objective of promoting reporting to the SEC.

5

It also preserves the balance between

6

the Dodd-Frank Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,

7

which already provides broad protections to

8

whistleblowers who report internally.

9

if the statute were somehow ambiguous, the

And even

10

SEC's interpretation is not entitled to

11

deference because its rule-making was

12

procedurally defective.

13

reject the interpretation of the Ninth Circuit,

14

and it should reverse the judgment of the Ninth

15

Circuit in this case.

This Court should

16

Now, by its terms, the Dodd-Frank

17

Act's anti-retaliation provision prohibits

18

retaliation only against a particular category

19

of persons; namely, whistleblowers.

20

statutory definition of whistleblower, again by

21

its terms, applies in this section.

22

And the

That section, of course, indisputably

23

includes the anti-retaliation provision, as

24

well as the award provisions.

25

the anti-retaliation provision only applies to

And, therefore,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

individuals who meet the statutory definition

2

of whistleblower; again, individuals who have

3

reported securities law violations to the SEC.

4

Now, as I said at the outset, we

5

believe that that's consistent with the

6

history, structure, and objectives of the

7

whistleblower provisions.

8
9

As to the history, perhaps the most
telling fact is the fact that an earlier

10

version of the anti-retaliation provision

11

reached all employees.

12

the provision to apply to a narrower set of

13

individuals, whistleblowers.

14

Congress then amended

As to the structure of these

15

provisions, in our view, the anti-retaliation

16

provision protects the very class of persons to

17

whom the award provisions provide incentives,

18

and, therefore, the anti-retaliation provision

19

in a very real sense works hand-and-glove with

20

the anti-retaliation -- with the award

21

provisions.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about

23

employees who must report internally before

24

they can report to the SEC?

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So, Justice Ginsburg,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

where an employee reports internally and then

2

suffers an adverse action in the immediate

3

aftermath of doing so, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

4

will provide protection.

5

In our view, the Dodd-Frank Act's

6

anti-retaliation provision only applies to

7

individuals who report to the SEC.

8

sure, it applies to those individuals really

9

without regard to the reason for retaliation.

10

And, to be

So just to make clear what our

11

affirmative interpretation of the

12

anti-retaliation provision and, in particular,

13

the third clause is, the third clause, which

14

was the last of the clauses to be added,

15

reaches a situation in which an employee, in

16

fact, reports to the SEC but is retaliated

17

against because of an internal report or

18

perhaps a report to another governmental

19

entity.

20

And precisely because a report to the

21

SEC will often be confidential, there may very

22

well be cases in which the reason for the

23

retaliation is not the report to the SEC, which

24

is covered by the first clause, but is instead

25

some other report, such as an internal report.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

Now, the primary argument on the other

2

side as to why our interpretation is somehow

3

absurd or as to why this is one of those

4

exceptional circumstances where the Court

5

should not pay heed to the unambiguous language

6

is that there are relatively few cases that

7

would be covered by the third clause.

8
9

But I don't think that there's really
any basis for that conclusion here.

As the

10

government recognizes in its brief, around

11

80 percent of individuals who report to the SEC

12

also report internally.

13

reasoning of really the leading case on the

14

other side, the Second Circuit's decision in

15

Berman, we know that there certainly is a

16

category of employees who report in both ways.

17

So then the question becomes whether,

And so contrary to the

18

in fact, there are very few cases in which an

19

individual is able to get to the step of

20

reporting to the SEC.

21

other side is that when an employee reports

22

internally, retaliation will come so quickly

23

that they will not be able also to report to

24

the SEC.

25

The argument on the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So can you please

2

subdivision (h)(1)(A)(ii)?

3

discrimination an employee who's been fired for

4

initiating, testifying in, or assisting in any

5

investigation or judicial or administrative

6

action of the Commission.

7

It protects from

Under what law is the employee who's

8

called by the SEC after another employee

9

reports the violation and assists the SEC in

10

its investigation, under your reading, that

11

employee is not protected?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I -- and I

14

don't know that that employee is protected

15

under the Sarbanes-Oxley provision either.

16

only thing that would protect that particular

17

employee is the government's reading.

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The

So, Justice Sotomayor,

19

I think you point up the reason why we actually

20

think that our interpretation must be correct,

21

and that is because the first and the second

22

clauses in subsection (h)(1)(A) actually were

23

already in the statute at the time that

24

Congress made the judgment, to which I adverted

25

a couple minutes ago, to replace the broader

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

term "employees, contractors, or agents" with

2

the narrower term "whistleblower."

3

Now, it may very well be that an

4

individual in your circumstance is not covered

5

by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but the critical

6

point is -­

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And they wouldn't

be covered by this act either?

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

They wouldn't.

But in

10

our view, in that circumstance, the decision by

11

Congress to replace "employees" with the

12

narrower term "whistleblower," in fact, takes

13

effect.

14

In other words, if you have a

15

circumstance in which you have employee 1, who,

16

in fact, reports the securities law violation

17

to the SEC, and employee 2, who merely

18

testifies in a subsequent SEC proceeding, the

19

replacement of "employee" with "whistleblower,"

20

in fact, knocks employee 2 out of the statute.

21

But we know that that was a considered judgment

22

made by Congress when the Senate replaced the

23

term "employee" with "whistleblower."

24

The primary anomaly on which

25

Respondent and the government relies, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

purported anomaly, relates not to the second

2

clause but to the third clause.

3

is that because the third clause was added at

4

the last minute, Congress somehow was not aware

5

of the fact that it was adding that clause to a

6

statute that already, by its terms, limited the

7

protected classes -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Their argument

Well, the SC -­

SEC has always been arguing -- they'll speak

10

for themselves, but they've always been arguing

11

that "whistleblower" should be given a natural

12

reading.

13

that because I'm not sure there's a natural

14

reading.

15

I'll question them on where they get

But assuming I accept that

16

proposition, isn't the fact that a natural

17

reading would cover that second employee and

18

potentially the third employee who is required

19

to report internally first, isn't that reason

20

enough because there are two provisions that

21

would be rendered partially nugatory?

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

5

Under our interpretation, all three of

6

these clauses have meaningful effect.

7

words, our primary submission is that what

8

Congress was trying to do in the

anti-retaliation provision was to provide broad

10

protection to individuals who report securities

11

law violations to the SEC, whatever the reason

12

for the retaliation.

critical to -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But isn't that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

disjunction quite odd?

2

anti-retaliation provision, you would think,

3

well, if I report internally and I'm fired for

4

it, then I get my protection.

5

Right?

A typical

But here you're saying they don't get

6

protection, except if they do something

7

completely unrelated, they might have made a

8

report to the SEC about a completely different

9

topic, they might have made it 10 years

10

earlier, and that's going to give them

11

protection even though they haven't been fired

12

for anything remotely to do with that.

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So, Justice Kagan, let

14

me explain why I think that makes sense.

15

do want to address this purported anomaly with

16

our interpretation with regard to the lack of a

17

nexus between the internal report and the SEC

18

report.

19

And I

I think more generally the reason why

20

this regime makes sense is precisely because

21

Congress adopted this more specific regime that

22

provides heightened protection to, in the words

23

of the title of the statute, securities

24

whistleblowers, against the backdrop of a

25

broader regime for whistleblowers more

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1
2

generally in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
And we know that Congress wanted those

3

two anti-retaliation regimes to coexist,

4

because in the very same section of Dodd-Frank

5

that added the Dodd-Frank anti-whistleblower

6

provision, Section 922, Congress also amended,

7

and to some extent expanded, the protection for

8

whistleblowers more generally in the

9

Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

10
11

Those are subsections (a)

and (c) of Section 922 more generally.
Now, what Respondent and the

12

government are asking you to do, to use the

13

metaphor from the last argument, is to view the

14

third clause in particular of the

15

anti-retaliation provision as the proverbial

16

elephant in a mouse hole, to say that when

17

Congress added the third clause, it was

18

essentially adding an all-purpose

19

anti-retaliation provision.

20

And I think that if that was what

21

Congress was doing, it would, at a minimum,

22

substantially diminish the role of the

23

Sarbanes-Oxley Act anti-retaliation provision,

24

if not render it effectively superfluous.

25

And, indeed -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if I could just -­

2

I guess I just don't understand what the theory

3

is.

4

internally report, and they're both fired.

5

There are two employees, and they both

And one of them, tough luck, but the

6

other one is going to get protection because

7

he's filed a report with the SEC about some

8

different matter entirely 10 years earlier.

9
10

Why does he get extra protection?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

So Congress was trying

11

to create incentives for reporting to the SEC,

12

and it did so by providing a carrot in the form

13

of the incentives in the award provisions and a

14

stick in the form of the anti-retaliation

15

provision in cases where that employee,

16

employee number 2, suffers retaliation, and,

17

again, really without regard to whether the

18

retaliation was because the employer happened

19

to find out about the SEC report specifically

20

and retaliated on that basis.

21

But you do raise the question of this

22

purported anomaly because you could potentially

23

have a case in which the employee makes a

24

report to the SEC and then reports some

25

entirely unconnected conduct internally.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

There

Official
15
1

could be some gap of time between those two

2

things.

3

Now, in our view, it's entirely

4

possible that Congress might very well have

5

made the judgment that it wanted to provide

6

protection, that it wanted to provide a broad

7

incentive to employees who suffer retaliation

8

over time and for a wide variety of

9

disclosures.

10

But to the extent that the government,

11

in particular, sort of cites this hypothetical

12

where, say, five years has passed between the

13

internal report and the report to the SEC, any

14

incidental overbreadth with our interpretation

15

pales in comparison to the wild overbreadth of

16

Respondent and the government's interpretation,

17

because Respondent and the government would

18

concededly cover cases in which an employee

19

makes a disclosure that bears no relation to a

20

securities violation.

21

And, tellingly, the SEC itself, in the

22

regulation at issue here, seemed to recognize

23

that absurdity because at the same time that

24

the SEC unexpectedly dispensed with the

25

requirement of reporting to the SEC, it sought

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

implicitly to narrow the category of

2

disclosures that are covered by the third

3

clause to disclosures involving securities law

4

violations or Section 1514(a) of

5

Sarbanes-Oxley.

6

And I think that that was a

7

recognition that there are many, many

8

hypotheticals that one can posit under

9

Respondent's and the government's

10

interpretation that really have nothing to do

11

with the securities laws at all.

12

And so, again, our core submission

13

here, Justice Kagan, is that this is a very

14

specific subset of cases that Congress was

15

targeting in the Dodd -- in the Dodd-Frank Act

16

and much more specific than the much broader

17

protection that was provided under

18

Sarbanes-Oxley.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

A question I would

20

have for both sides really is, what do you

21

think, is there any -- could the SEC here

22

promulgate a regulation that would define the

23

manner of reporting to the SEC, which manner

24

would include the class of cases where the

25

report or the information goes to an audit

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

committee under circumstances such that, were

2

the audit committee and others to do nothing

3

about it, it would likely end up at the SEC's

4

window?

5
6

MR. SHANMUGAM:
the SEC could do that.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9
10

So I don't think that

Why not?
Our core submission is

that the SEC cannot dispense with the statutory
requirement of reporting to the SEC.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -­

It doesn't.

It

12

14

arguably doesn't.

defining a manner of reporting to the SEC.

16

That's what I -- I worked this out,

It is providing for -- it's

And the manner includes just what I

17

said, report to an Audit Committee under

18

circumstances where, if no action is taken, it

19

is likely to end up at the SEC.

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't think -­
And it might not

22

physically get there, but, nonetheless, this is

23

a class of cases where quite likely it will get

24

to the SEC.

25

What's wrong with that?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Breyer, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

think it has to get there.

2

has to get there?

5
6

In other words, I

MR. SHANMUGAM:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, if they're caught

8

on the way because they don't get there because

9

there's a snowstorm, doesn't count?

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Under the statutory

11

language, and this is in the definition in

12

subsection (a)(6), the whistleblower has to

13

provide information to the Commission.

14

Now, you're right that it goes on to

15

say, "in a manner, established by rule or

16

regulation, by the Commission," and I would

17

submit, Justice Breyer, that the Commission

18

does have broad authority to issue a regulation

19

concerning how that information has to be

20

provided.

21

just that in Rule 21(f)-9 with regard to the

22

award provisions, and it says that you have to

23

report either on-line or by using a particular

24

form.

25

And, indeed, the Commission has done

We have no quibble with that.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official
19
1

what I don't think you can do, contrary to the

2

submission in one of the amicus briefs, is to

3

use the "in the manner" language to define away

4

the separate requirement of reporting to the

5

Commission.

6

That is a distinct statutory

7

requirement, and, again, I don't think that the

8

Commission really has any leeway in that

9

regard.

10

I do think that the way that the

11

Commission went about the rule-making here is

12

telling.

13

proposed rule, the SEC issued a rule that

14

merely tracked the statutory definition, and

15

the SEC provided no indication in the notice of

16

proposed rule-making that it was contemplating

17

the possibility of dispensing with that

18

requirement.

19
20

As the Court will be aware, in the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But aren't there

comments to that effect?

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

There were three

22

comments out of the 240 or so that seemed to

23

suggest that the Commission might want to do

24

that.

25

But I don't think that the mere fact

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

that there were a small number of comments that

2

suggested that is an indication that interested

3

parties as a whole were on notice that this

4

issue was potentially in play.

5

There were certainly some who thought

6

that that would be desirable, but there is

7

nothing in the notice of proposed rule-making,

8

and to the extent that Respondent and the

9

government cites some language that suggests

10

that the Commission was considering broadening

11

the application of the anti-retaliation

12

provision and inviting comments to that effect,

13

the very previous sentence in the notice of

14

proposed rule-making indicates that the

15

Commission intended to retain the requirement

16

of reporting to the SEC.

17

So, again, there was no notice, until

18

such a time as the Commission came out with its

19

final rule and converted the one statutory

20

definition of whistleblower into two.

21

And I think that there can be no

22

better evidence of how nakedly atextual

23

Respondent and the government's interpretation

24

is than the final rule itself, which contains

25

these two separate definitions, the one for

finger on something I -- I don't know what to

6

do with.

7

I thought the argument made below was

8

a plausible argument, that they have made a

9

rule like the one I was just suggesting, and

10

then you come back and say:

11

rule-making proceeding was no good, they didn't

12

tell anybody they were going to do this, and

this is way beyond, dah-dah-dah.

Well, the

And -- and I -- and then there's no

20

answer that I've found, I don't know how that

21

works, what am I supposed to do with that?

22

Have they abandoned all that here or what?

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Sure.

Justice Breyer,

24

let me address that.

And I do, by the way,

25

want to come back to Justice Sotomayor's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

question about the ordinary meaning of

2

whistleblower.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:
you don't want.

You don't have to, if

I can look it up, you know.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, let me address

6

your question first.

Our submission, our core

7

submission to the Court is this is a simple

8

case that can be resolved at step 1 of Chevron,

9

the terms and reach of the statutory definition

10

are unambiguous and there's certainly no

11

absurdity here.

12

If this Court were somehow to get to

13

step 2 of Chevron, we have an argument under

14

Encino Motorcars that this Court should not

15

afford Chevron deference because the

16

rule-making was procedurally defective for the

17

reasons that I just mentioned.

18

The other side rightly points out that

19

we did not make that argument below.

20

believe that it is necessary for us to have

21

made that argument below, because this is just

22

another argument in response to their claim

23

that there should be Chevron deference here.

24
25

We don't

And, parenthetically, this Court's
decision in Encino Motorcars came down while

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

the briefing was ongoing in the Ninth Circuit.

2

But as to the argument concerning

3

timing, because there is an argument made by

4

the Respondent, though not by the government,

5

that we're somehow out of time here, let me

6

explain why that's not true.

7

Respondent relies on section, I

8

believe it's 2401, which is the general

9

six-year limitations period for claims against

10

the government.

11

that is applicable in ordinary APA actions.

12

That is a limitations period

We are not raising a free-standing APA

13

claim here.

14

Encino Motorcars, is simply an argument that

15

the rule should not be given Chevron deference.

16

It's not even an argument that the rule is

17

somehow invalid.

18

most, the SEC is entitled to Skidmore deference

19

here.

20

Our argument, consistent with

It's an argument that, at

And so we don't think that it would be

21

appropriate to apply the six-year limitations

22

period here, and to the extent that Respondent

23

relies on the D.C. Circuit's decision in a case

24

called Gem Broadcasting, that was a case in

25

which a regulated party was essentially arguing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

for invalidity.

2

of argument we're making here.

3

They were not making the type

Now, with regard to the ordinary

4

meaning of whistleblower because I do want to

5

finish up my answer to Justice Sotomayor's

6

question from now some time ago, I think we

7

would concede that the term "whistleblower"

8

naturally refers to an individual who reports

9

misconduct, but I don't think that we would

10

concede that there is an ordinary meaning as to

11

the person to whom the misconduct is reported.

12

I think, if anything, if you look at

13

sources like Black's Law Dictionary, they seem

14

to suggest that you have to have reporting to a

15

government authority.

16

think that it is telling that contrary to the

17

Solicitor General's submission, Congress really

18

is not using the unadorned term "whistleblower"

19

very often in statutes.

20

And so, you know, I

It's either using a different term or

21

it is providing a definition for whistleblower.

22

And I think that that is, again, precisely what

23

Congress was doing here.

24
25

Congress consciously made the decision
to replace the term "employee" with the term

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

"whistleblower," and Congress added the third

2

clause, which is concededly the broadest of the

3

three clauses, to a statute that already used

4

the term "whistleblower."

5

And this is just not one of those

6

paradigmatic cases in which the text points in

7

one direction but there's legislative history

8

to the contrary.

9

legislative history with regard to the third

10
11

There's really no actual

clause.
And it is quite telling that the

12

government in its brief can muster no

13

legislative history other than an article from

14

Law 360 that it cites in Footnote 15.

15

And if you take a look at that article

16

and you take a look at the underlying e-mails

17

that are cited in that article, there's really

18

no indication even that the individual who

19

allegedly proposed the third clause thought

20

that what he was doing was extending the

21

statute beyond the statutorily-defined category

22

of whistleblowers to individuals who merely

23

report internally.

24
25

Unless the Court has any further
questions, I think I'll reserve the balance of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

my time for rebuttal if needed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL L. GEYSER

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8

MR. GEYSER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

9

The true elephant in the mouse hole

10

here would be using the indirect use of the

11

word whistleblower in subsection (h) to limit

12

what is otherwise a broad and sweeping clause

13

that aligns Dodd-Frank's amendment with the

14

modern trend of major whistleblowing

15

legislation.

16

Now, to start with Justice Kagan's

17

point, it is -- actually, it is exactly true

18

that Petitioner's reading does create a serious

19

anomaly.

20

time, it could be half a decade or a decade

21

earlier, on a completely unrelated issue,

22

they're a whistleblower for life.

23

report they make at a later time is protected,

24

even if the information doesn't get to the SEC.

25

If anyone reports to the SEC at any

So any

But I think there's actually an even

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

greater anomaly.

2

Congress, all they really were concerned about

3

here was getting information to the government,

4

to the SEC.

5

My friend suggests that

Take someone who reports internally,

6

as they're often required to do under

7

Sarbanes-Oxley, and they're immediately

8

terminated.

9

of that meeting they report to the SEC.

And then the second they walk out
They

10

even use the right fax number and they use the

11

right form.

12

information that Congress supposedly wanted it

13

to obtain.

14

this provision.

15
16

That way the SEC has exactly the

That person isn't protected under

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, but he's

protected under Sarbanes-Oxley, isn't he?

17

MR. GEYSER:

Yes, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

So in all the

19

differences that he has maybe a shorter statute

20

of limitations and you have to go through an

21

exhaustion procedure.

22

anomaly about saying, well, you're reporting

23

directly to the SEC, you're going to have a -­

24

a shorter -- you're going to have a longer

25

statute of limitations and you don't have to

So -- so what is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

exhaust, but if it's an indirect thing, you do.

2

Why is that anomalous?

3

MR. GEYSER:

It is highly anomalous,

4

Your Honor.

5

Congress added a clause (iii) is to strengthen

6

the remedies in Sarbanes-Oxley.

7

prevents -­

8
9
10

The -- the entire reason that

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sarbanes-Oxley

It does.

It

strengthens them in the cases where they report
to the SEC, which is what it says.

11

MR. GEYSER:

Well, it reports -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And strengthens it

13

just means you don't have to exhaust.

14

what's the big deal?

15

MR. GEYSER:

So

But -- but it would

16

strengthen it in a way that would not protect

17

people who occasionally do report to the SEC

18

and protect people who later don't report to

19

the SEC.

20

That doesn't make any sense.
And so I -- I -- and the other thing

21

it would do too is it puts the employer in a

22

position of being entirely unaware of the

23

critical factor that activates or takes away

24

protection under clause (iii).

25

So it -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, the -­

2

the employer is rarely knowledgeable about the

3

SEC filing.

4

confidentiality of the filing.

5

MR. GEYSER:

6

I believe the SEC rules require

That -- that's -- exactly

right.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So virtually

8

always an employer is going to fire someone

9

because of internal reporting, not because of

10

SEC reporting.

11

MR. GEYSER:

That -- that's right,

12

Your Honor, but what that really shows is that

13

this is a highly unusual form of an

14

anti-retaliation statute.

15

statutes are designed to deter specific

16

conduct.

17

Anti-retaliation

And here we know that Congress was

18

focused on deterring specific conduct because

19

subsection (h) is framed in terms of a

20

prohibition on employers.

21

shall not take certain acts against people

22

engaged in certain conduct.

23

It says employers

The use of whistleblower is entirely

24

indirect.

It would be highly unusual for

25

Congress to think that they were trying to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

bolster remedies in Sarbanes-Oxley because they

2

did realize these were highly ineffective.

3

There is evidence in the record, we do

cite studies in our brief, that show that

5

Sarbanes-Oxley generally was providing relief

6

in under 10 percent of cases.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about this

case?

Did -- did Somers avail himself of

Sarbanes-Oxley or just Dodd-Frank?

could Congress have been than to say in this

What else would you have had Congress

do if it had wanted to achieve that which your

opponent says it achieved?
MR. GEYSER:

doesn't read language like that in isolation.

13

It has to read it against a backdrop of -­

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm asking what -­

what would you have had Congress do?
MR. GEYSER:

17

what they could have done, and given all the

18

anomalies that this would produce and how -­

legislation, they'd have to be a lot clearer

than they were here, but let me give you -­

could they have possibly been?

point.

included a parenthetical after the word

"whistleblower" that said as this term is used

in Sarbanes-Oxley or as this term is used in

point would think that the definition in

subsection (a)(6) applies.

18

Suppose that in subsection (h) Congress

Our contention is that the clear

19

meaning from the text, the context, the

20

structure, the purpose, the history of this

provision is tantamount to that kind of

parenthetical.

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So -- so -­

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

this case, Utility Air, the difficulty of

Well, but -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

applying the defined term in that case strikes

2

me as so -- so much more insurmountable than in

3

this case.

4

MR. GEYSER:

I think it could be more

5

or less, Your Honor, but I think the important

6

point here is that having an incentive to skip

7

over internal reporting would be disastrous to

8

the modern scheme of securities regulation,

9

which turns on internal reporting.

question and -- because, see, I don't put as

18

much -- I'll be perhaps a little bit more

19

willing to go with your not clear language,

20

maybe, but it seems to make sense what Congress

21

was trying to do to follow the language.

You're using -- and that's why I

Because the ordinary

25

exhaustion.

He just has to have some

And it's a shorter statute of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1
2

limitations.
And if you want to make it tougher,

3

which they do, it makes sense in a statute

4

that's mostly about awards for reporting to the

5

SEC to say it's where the SEC is directly

6

involved that we cut out the need to exhaust,

7

that we cut out the need, while if, in fact,

8

you read it your way, we -- we've basically

9

eliminated Sarbanes-Oxley because everybody

10
11

would bring it under this provision.
Now, that's -- that's why, when you

12

say, you know, this is totally anomalous, this

13

is a disaster, et cetera, et cetera, I say:

14

Well, you haven't shown me that yet.

15

you want to spend one minute on doing that.

16

MR. GEYSER:

Sure.

So maybe

I mean, first,

17

Your Honor, this would not eliminate the

18

Sarbanes-Oxley remedial scheme even though it

19

was largely ineffective.

20

people who would prefer it because they don't

21

have a lawyer, they'd prefer to have the

MR. GEYSER:

would Congress want to treat lawyers and

So why

incentivized to do what they're already legally

obligated to do.

6

They've got a protection,

7

Sarbanes-Oxley.

Why put them under the

8

whistleblower statute as well?

9

MR. GEYSER:

Because Congress saw

10

examples, and they saw this in Enron, where

11

people were deterred from fulfilling those

12

roles and disclosing the information in

13

whistleblowing because they didn't want to be

14

terminated.

15
16

And the threat of termination -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that was

Sarbanes-Oxley.

MR. GEYSER:

And -- and Dodd-Frank -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that's the

19

statute Congress provided to incentivize them

20

to do what they were legally obligated to do.

21

MR. GEYSER:

Sure.

And Congress

22

specifically singled out the protections in

23

Sarbanes-Oxley as something that needed to be

24

bolstered in Dodd-Frank.

25

it's fair to divorce the two from each other.

So I -- I don't think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I see

2

Dodd-Frank as -- as expanding the category of

3

people, not limiting or -- or expanding it to

4

include people who are already included.

5

MR. GEYSER:

Well, it -- it does

6

expand people in some situations like with

7

self-regulatory organizations who aren't

8

covered under Sarbanes-Oxley.

9

that doesn't apply for internal reporters in

10
11

But notably then

those groups under Petitioner's reading.
So even though Congress would have

12

singled out those people and said these people

13

should be protected from making internal

14

disclosures, they would actually have no legal

15

protection at all if they didn't first report

16

to the SEC, which, again, is contrary to even

17

the regulated stakeholder's interest in this

18

very setting.

19

We know from the Chamber of Commerce,

20

who submitted elaborate comments during the

21

notice and comment process, that the policy

22

touchstone of Dodd-Frank -- and I think this

23

goes a little bit too to Justice Breyer's

24

question -- should be preserving internal

25

compliance systems.

It's -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'd like to talk

2

about that notice and comment period for just a

3

moment.

4

language problem, so you've got to generate an

5

ambiguity.

6

your move.

7

It seems to me you've got this plain

That's the first step of your -­

Then the second step is that the SEC

8

has reasonably resolved that ambiguity and that

9

we should defer to it.

10

But here the notice and comment period

11

provided notice that -- that we're going to

12

issue a rule-making with respect to

13

whistleblowers who report to the Commission.

14

Then -- then the rule comes out and

15

says reporting to the Commission is not

16

required, in an ipsi dixit unreasoned opinion,

17

one line basically, and then we have two

18

circuits that actually gave deference to that

19

interpretation.

20

Now, that seems to me to put the whole

21

administrative process on its head because

22

you're providing no notice to people, no

23

reasonable opportunity to comment, maybe a few

24

people spot the issue, but most people don't.

25

The agency acts without the benefit of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

the notice and comment and is unable to issue a

2

reasoned decision-making, and then we're

3

supposed to defer to that to resolve this

4

ambiguity?

Help me out with that scheme.

5

MR. GEYSER:

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

7

That just doesn't

quite hold together for me.

8
9

Sure.

MR. GEYSER:

Let me try to break it

down into a number of steps.

Now, first, to be

10

clear, I think we win under act -- under the -­

11

the better reading of the statute.

12

even need any deference at all.

13

We don't

But to -- to go through the steps, on

14

page 70,511 in the Federal Register, the agency

15

specifically asked for comments about whether

16

to broaden or change the definition of

17

whistleblower for purposes of the

18

anti-retaliation sentence.

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It said to the

20

Commission, for reports to the Commission, that

21

language is in there, too, right?

22

MR. GEYSER:

Well, that -- that

23

language is in the initial -- in the initial

24

rule.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yeah.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

MR. GEYSER:

It also suggested,

2

though, that you could qualify under the

3

whistleblower protections without satisfying

4

all the manners of reporting to the Commission.

5

So I think there actually was some ambiguity

6

there.

7

And, again, the SEC specifically

8

requested comments on that exact issue.

Three

9

people did comment on it and suggested that it

10

should make clear, the SEC should make clear

11

that internal whistleblowers are covered.

12

The Association of Corporate Counsel

13

implied that they just assumed that -- and this

14

is a pretty big group -- they -- they assumed

15

that internal whistleblowers were covered.

16

There's not a single comment out of

17

the over 250 or so that were submitted that

18

suggested that internal reporting would not be

19

protected under Dodd-Frank, and I think that's

20

telling, because I don't know any corporation,

21

while they were strongly urging the Commission

22

--

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, if it's not -­

24

if it's not -- if it's not fairly put to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

don't comment on it?

2

MR. GEYSER:

Well, Your Honor, we

3

disagree that it wasn't fairly put to the

4

notice because they specifically requested

5

comments on exactly this topic.

6

generally considered enough.

7

That's

But -- and for the reasoned

8

explanation, we think they did provide a

9

sufficient basis, certainly as -- as strong a

10

basis as the agency provided in the Long Island

11

case.

12

But I also want to make another point

13

that I think goes back to the original

14

definition of whistleblower, and I do think

15

this is important, and it shows that what

16

Congress really had in mind with (a)(6) had

17

nothing to do with the anti-retaliation

18

provision.

19

The sentence does not end -­

I'm looking at the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yeah, it's -- should

-- should the anti-retaliation protections,

3

yada, yada, yada, apply broadly to any person

4

who provides information to the Commission

5

concerning a potential violation, right?

6
7

MR. GEYSER:

Your Honor, but, again,

it's should we broaden it, should we change it.

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

yeah, but to the Commission, right?

10

MR. GEYSER:

To the Commission,

Your Honor, part -- part

11

of the logical outgrowth test, which -- which I

12

think this Court has -- has effectively

13

endorsed, but I think there's some lack of

14

clarity there, too, it doesn't require that the

15

exact proposal be endorsed.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but his point

17

really, I think, is that notice which says

18

we're going to include who counts as providing

19

information to the Commission does not put

20

people on notice that they are including -­

21

going to apply it to people who don't provide

22

information to the Commission.

23

I mean, that's English, I would think.

24

Now, that's the question.

That's why I

25

actually found your argument below, perhaps -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

but you've abandoned that, right?
Now we're just back at -- if I find

3

this sort of interesting, your argument below,

4

I'm out of luck, it's abandoned, gone, right?

5

MR. GEYSER:

Your -- Your Honor, the

6

-- I think the argument that was accepted by

7

the Ninth Circuit below didn't suggest that the

8

SEC was saying that if -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, but I mean I

10

asked that -- first, I want you to answer

11

Justice Gorsuch's question.

12

Second, I just wonder separately

13

whether I am just bound by what seems to be

14

your concession, I guess I am, that the

15

argument below is abandoned.

16

MR. GEYSER:

Your Honor, I think that

17

you can affirm on any ground that's present in

18

the record.

19

better reading of it, then -- then we would

20

warmly embrace it.

So, if you think that that's the

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. GEYSER:

Justice Gorsuch, I think

23

that -- I think, again, that the logical

24

outgrowth test would assume that in a

25

proceeding -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But the logical

2

outgrowth test, is -- is it anticipated that

3

something is going to follow?

5

Is it reasonable

And, again, what's reasonable about

6

saying X and then doing not X or the opposite

7

of X, and then doing it in an ipsi dixit,

8

one-line sentence, that's unreasoned and

9

wouldn't normally get much deference from us in

10

the first place.

11

MR. GEYSER:

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

13
14

The -­
How does all that

get you Chevron?
MR. GEYSER:

The -- the key issue in

15

the proceeding was how do you deal with the

16

interaction between internal reporting and

17

preserving internal compliance mechanisms and

18

-- and the anti-retaliation provision and

19

making sure that the award provision -- program

20

makes sense.

21

So I think the -- the interaction of

22

those things suggests that, while corporations

23

thought we need to preserve internal

24

compliance, so we need to make sure that people

25

first report internally and give corporations a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

chance to fix the problem, that the necessary

2

counterpart to that is people have to be

3

protected when they internally report.

4

It doesn't make any sense to say that

5

people have to engage in internal reporting,

6

yet they're unprotected when they do that.

7

I'd like to get to -- to the (a)(6).

8

Again, the definition section does not end by

9

saying the report has to go to the Commission.

10

It says, "in a manner established by rule or

11

regulation by the Commission."

12

And I think that's important because

13

Congress realized that the Commission needed to

14

-- to prevent the situation where the SEC has a

15

big enforcement award and everyone comes out of

16

the woodwork and they all claim an entitlement

17

to part of that award.

18

The manner established by the

19

Commission ensures that there is a -- a simple,

20

easy way to track exactly who's eligible for

21

award and who is not.

22

limit the anti-retaliation section to whether a

23

whistleblower filled out the right form or

24

faxed a form to the exact right number, even if

25

they provided information to the SEC,

Congress did not need to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

accomplishing the -- the core objective of the

2

whistleblower litigation -- legislation in the

3

very first place.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I just ask

5

whether Somers -- was there any reason he

6

didn't report to the SEC?

7

MR. GEYSER:

He -- I think it just

8

simply did not occur to him at the time.

9

so -- and in the same way that he missed the

10

limitations period for the Sarbanes-Oxley

11

claim.

12

And

What he tried to do was do the right

13

thing, and to honor the corporate Code of

14

Conduct by calling the -- the misconduct to his

15

supervisor's attention, which again is exactly

16

what all the corporate stakeholders, you know,

17

in this proceeding have said is their goal,

18

too.

19

No one thinks it's better to have

20

reports go directly to the SEC, unless the

21

corporation is entirely unwilling to remediate

22

and address the problem.

23

consistent with the -- the natural, regulatory

24

scheme in Sarbanes-Oxley; and Dodd-Frank is not

25

passed in a vacuum.

So, I -- again, it is

Dodd-Frank is part -- and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

Sarbanes-Oxley work together.

2

provisions of the Exchange Act.

3

They each amend

So I -- I don't think it -- I think

4

it's highly odd to say that in Dodd-Frank,

5

Congress wanted to create a heavy incentive not

6

to report internally, but in Sarbanes-Oxley,

7

Congress was focused intently on internal

8

reporting and especially internal reporting of

9

lawyers and auditors.

10

So, under my friend's reading,

11

Dodd-Frank would leave those critical groups,

12

the groups that this Court in Lawson versus FMR

13

recognized were best equipped to spot and

14

detect and prevent fraud, out of these critical

15

protections after Congress recognized that

16

Sarbanes-Oxley had been ineffective in getting

17

lawyers and auditors and other employees to

18

report internally.

19

This is critical whistleblower

20

protections, and we don't see any basis for

21

carving those groups out of the statute.

22

If the Court has no further questions.

ORAL ARGUMENT of CHRISTOPHER G. MICHEL

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS

3

AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. MICHEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

6

The statutory definition of

7

whistleblower is tailor-made for the awards

8

program, but it does not fit in the retaliation

9

programs.

10

Giving the term its ordinary meaning

11

in the retaliation context would harmonize the

12

statute and avoid the anomalies that would

13

result from woodenly applying the statutory

14

definition.

15

Some of those anomalies have been

16

discussed already by the Court.

But I do think

17

the most drastic one is that applying the

18

statutory definition, which requires reporting

19

to the Commission, into clause (iii) of the

20

retaliation provisions, which protects internal

21

reporting, would decouple retaliation liability

22

from the Act that causes the retaliation, and

23

moreover, would make employers liable for

24

conduct that they don't know about.

25

in our view would be a one of a kind

Now, that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

retaliation provision in the U.S. Code.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

think that that's a real anomaly.

4

-- I also think if you really look at the way

5

this statute came to be, it's quite possible

6

the way this provision gets in very late in the

7

game, that they didn't know that they'll -­

8

they forgot about this definitional provision,

9

and they were meaning it more in the ordinary

10

So, Mr. Michel, I do
And I -- I

language sense.

11

But there you are, you have this

12

definitional provision, and it says what it

13

says.

14

And you have to have a really, really severe

15

anomaly to get over that.

16

And it says it applies to this section.

So what makes it rise to that level?

17

It's odd; it's peculiar; it's probably not what

18

Congress meant.

19

thing where we can just say we're going to

20

ignore it?

21

But what makes it the kind of

MR. MICHEL:

So, Justice Kagan, I'd

22

direct you to the Lawson versus Suwannee Fruit

23

case, which I think is often cited as -- as a

24

canonical case on statutory definitions.

25

was a worker's compensation case.

And the

That

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

statute included the term "injury," which was

2

defined understandably enough for a worker's

3

compensation case as injury on the job.

4

But there was a provision in which the

5

employer was relieved from liability if the

6

employee had a preexisting injury.

7

Court said if you apply the statutory

8

definition to that preexisting injury and

9

require that injury to be on the job, that

And the

10

would be anomalous, because it would unfairly

11

assign liability to the employer, and it would

12

deter the statutory purpose of keeping

13

employers from retaliating against disabled

14

employees.

15

So I think that decision is analogous

16

here.

You would deter employers from -- excuse

17

me -- you would unfairly apportion liability to

18

employers based on conduct that they don't know

19

about, and you would take out the premise of

20

the retaliation provision, because the very

21

conduct that is an element in the retaliation

22

claim -- reporting to the Commission -- is

23

different from the conduct for which they

24

retaliated against the employee.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

One -­

Now this sort of thing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

will come up in other cases in which the

2

government is involved.

3

write an opinion that uses the terminology that

4

you just used?

5

And do you want us to

So, you have a statute with a -- that

6

uses a particular term, and there's a

7

definitional provision in the statute.

8

what we write is that the definition in the

9

statute doesn't apply if it produces an

10
11
12
13

And

anomaly.
Is that the standard?

That's all you

need to get out of the definitional provision?
MR. MICHEL:

I -- I think, you know,

14

if you look at Suwannee Fruit, for example, the

15

Court talked about incongruities, it talked

16

about undermining the purpose of the statute.

17

If you look at the -- the Public

18

Utilities case, the Court talks about

19

undermining the purpose of the statute.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought -- I

21

thought the stock phrase was absurd, that you

22

-- if the statute gives a definition, you

23

follow the definition in the statute unless it

24

would lead, not merely to an anomaly, but to an

25

absurd result.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. MICHEL:

Justice Ginsburg, I -- I

applied.

you'd agree you don't have an absurdity here.

9

I mean, the government concedes that

10

subsection (iii) would cover a subset of cases

11

-- maybe not as much as -- as the government

12

would like, but -- but it's not an absurd

reading, right?

MR. MICHEL:

15

it's absurd.

16

Gorsuch.

17

We're not arguing that

That -- that's correct, Justice

It would, however, I -- I do want to

stress how narrow the meaning that would be

19

left for clause (iii) is.

That -­

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

mean, it's not just that it's not absurd.

22

seems to me if you look at Utility Air, it has

23

to be -- not absurd or anomalous, whatever you

24

want to say -- it has to be cut very broadly.

25

Well, but, I
It

I mean, if you get to a tiny little

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53

thing and you're saying, well, the definition

2

doesn't work there, it's one thing to say,

3

well, then we're not going to apply it to that

4

provision.

5

The cases where you're allowed to move

6

beyond the defined term are when if you stick

7

to it, it really makes a mess of the whole

8

thing.

9

MR. MICHEL:

I agree, Mr. Chief

10

Justice, but I think it's a pretty big mess

11

that -- that the Petitioner's reading is -- is

making here.

13

to the anomalies we've already discussed, I do

think a very important one is that Petitioner's

reading would eviscerate the incentive for

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

might have an argument there if there weren't

22

And so the Chief Justice's point and Justice

23

Breyer's point is that if it were to make a

hash of the entire statute, and there'd be

meaning -- no meaning at all, maybe, maybe, but

responses, Justice Gorsuch.

8

available under Sarbanes-Oxley.

9

was -­

what they do do, right?

on that?

And what they did do was

19

change the statute of limitations from six

20

months to six years.

21

back pay to double back pay.

22

They changed the single

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Do you want to

23

comment on the notice and -- and rule-making

24

procedures here and its reference to how much

25

deference we owe?

And I -- I, again, I'm just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

stuck with the absence of any fair notice, an

2

ipse dixit decision, without any reasons that

3

wouldn't normally pass muster under the APA;

4

and then we have two circuit courts that

5

nonetheless thought that it was appropriate to

6

defer to that, which seems to me allowing an

7

agency to swallow a large amount of legislative

8

power and judicial power in the process, giving

9

up our opportunity to -- to -- to interpret the

10

law as it is.

11

MR. MICHEL:

So I just -- I -- I'll

12

start with a small correction, which is the

13

court of appeals in this case actually

14

serious procedural deficiency of its own, in

think Petitioner pointed to what we think is

the closest statement in the rule, which is at

page 70,511, and lays out, you know, as -- as

kind of an important little phrase there.

that.

that it couldn't have been written more

12

clearly.

I do think if you look at -­

I think it was

written very clearly.
MR. MICHEL:

Well, I think if you look

16

actually, Justice Gorsuch, at the -- at the

17

Long Island Care case, which I think is -- is

18

probably this Court's leading case on the

19

logical outgrowth test, it -- it ultimately

20

says that, you know, proposing X and getting

21

not X is enough to satisfy the logical

22

outgrowth.

23

Now, maybe that's not logical, but

24

that is the -- you know, the Court's precedent

25

in this area.

And I think we certainly satisfy

Heritage Reporting Corporation

that test here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Bottom line, are

3

you -- how much are you relying on just Chevron

4

deference here?

5

MR. MICHEL:

That -- that's not even

6

our principal argument.

We're -- we're

7

certainly happy to have Chevron deference if

8

you find the statute ambiguous, but we -- we

9

think you can resolve this without Chevron

10

deference, simply as the Ninth Circuit did in

11

its primary holding by saying that we have the

12

best reading of the statute.

13

of the lower courts have done that too.

14

There's a District of Nebraska opinion that we

15

cite that I think is particularly helpful in -­

in evaluating the statute.

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I think a number

Would -- would you

agree, though, that a notice-and-comment

19

rule-making that didn't provide fair notice

20

shouldn't be deferred to?

reasons that we have discussed.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Are you wary of the

government conceding that point?

I would be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

wary of that because I don't know what

2

implications it has for other cases where, in

3

fact, you start chipping away in an unforeseen

4

way, I mean maybe -- I can think of a lot of

5

reasons for not deferring to the rule here.

6

Among others, it doesn't refer to manner.

7

There's nothing in there about manner that I

8

could find.

9

I could think of reasons, but I -- I'm

just saying I -- that is not necessarily what

whistleblowing and internal reporting, which I

18

think is something that there's a unity of

19

interest from employees, employers, and the

20

Commission.

21
22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

So why don't you

give an award for that?

23
24

And -- and my friend -­

MR. MICHEL:

May I answer, Mr. Chief

Justice?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Certainly.

MR. MICHEL:

We do actually give an

2

award for people who report internally if the

3

-- if the company then reports to the

4

Commission and the person then reports within

5

120 days.

6

principle.

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You only give it

if they report to the SEC?

9
10

So the rule does reflect that

MR. MICHEL:

They have to ultimately

report to the SEC within 120 days.

11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Shanmugam, seven minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

16
17
18
19

Thank you,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:
on rebuttal.

Just two quick points

And thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

The first, with regard to these cases

20

concerning statutory definitions, I think if

21

you look at the cases cited by Respondent and

22

the government, most of those cases are cases

23

in which either the terms of the statutory

24

definition are ambiguous or in which the reach

25

of the statutory definition is unclear.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

Whereas here, both the terms and the

2

reach of the statutory definition are

3

unambiguous, this Court has refused to give

4

effect to a statutory definition, only where it

5

would lead to absurd results.

6

many of those cases are pre-1986 cases.

7

And to be sure,

They do not use the term "absurdity,"

8

but they sound in absurdity.

And the perfect

9

example of that is Mr. Michel's favorite case,

10

Lawson versus Suwannee Fruit.

11

in which if the statutory definition of

12

disability were given effect, an employer would

13

be liable for the entirety of an employee's

14

disability, even if the previous partial

15

disability occurred when the employee was not

16

on the job.

17

That was a case

And the Court said that that would

18

lead to obvious incongruities in the language

19

and destroy the very purpose of the statute.

20

So, again, that's absurdity by any other name.

21

And to the extent that Respondent and

22

the government seem to suggest that absurdity

23

is not required here, I would submit that it

24

would be a very odd regime of statutory

25

interpretation if this Court were to apply a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

different standard to unambiguous language in a

2

statutory definition from the standard that it

3

applies where you have unambiguous language

4

anywhere else.

5

provides a specific statutory definition, that

6

ought to be given effect and more respect,

7

rather than less.

8
9

If anything, where Congress

And to the extent that there may be
some incidental overbreadth with our

10

interpretation because one could posit a

11

hypothetical in which there's really not a

12

nexus between the internal report and the

13

report to the SEC, I would respectfully submit

14

that this case is a lot like the Court's last

15

whistleblower case, Lawson versus FMR, where

16

the Court said that incidental overbreadth, the

17

mere fact that one could think of hypotheticals

18

involving gardeners, nannies, and housekeepers

19

in the words of the Court, is not enough to

20

invalidate an interpretation, particularly

21

where the contrary interpretation suffers from

22

a similar deficiency, the wild overbreadth to

23

which I referred in my opening.

24

And my second point is just a brief

25

point on the procedural issue concerning the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

rule-making here.

2

his finger on the exact language in the

3

proposed rule that makes clear that the SEC was

4

operating from the premise that reporting to

5

the Commission was required.

6

I think Justice Gorsuch put

And to the extent that the Commission

7

asked whether the application of the

8

anti-retaliation provision could be limited or

9

broadened, it was asking about limiting or

10

broadening it in other ways, such as by adding

11

the same requirements, the procedural

12

requirements that apply to eligibility for the

13

award provisions, to the anti-retaliation

14

provision as well.

15

And it is certainly true, as

16

Mr. Geyser said, that this Court and lower

17

courts have often asked whether the final rule

18

is somehow the logical outgrowth from the

19

proposed rule.

20

Randolph from the D.C. Circuit, something

21

cannot grow out of nothing.

But in the words of Judge

22

And where there is nothing in the

23

proposed rule to put interested parties on

24

notice that an agency is considering a

25

particular interpretation, it would be the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

height of inequity to uphold a rule and to

2

afford deference to the agency in those

3

circumstances.

4

In our view, the SEC's interpretation

5

here was procedurally improper, as well as

6

substantively invalid, and for that reason and

7

the other reasons set out in the briefs, the

8

judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be

9

reversed.

10

Thank you.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
