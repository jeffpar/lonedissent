ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9
10
11

MR. KELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Texas legislature did not have a

12

racially discriminatory purpose when it adopted

13

the entire court-ordered congressional remedial

14

plan and virtually all of the remedial state

15

house plan.

16

This Court told the district court to

17

order districts that do not violate the

18

Constitution or the VRA, and on remand in 2012,

19

the district court itself said it obeyed this

20

Court's remand and it fixed all plausible legal

21

defects under even the low Section 5 standard.

22

And, indeed, today, with nine groups of

23

plaintiffs here, we cannot draw a single

24

additional performing majority/minority

25

district, even though plaintiffs have tried for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

years under both plans.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General Keller, I

3

know you want to get to the merits, but I don't

4

want to leave the jurisdiction question.

5

this last point raises it for me in stark

6

relief, which is your -- you just said you

7

can't draw this map.

8

can.

9

And

The court below said you

By not waiting for the remedy in this

10

case, we are not in a position to be fully

11

informed on that question.

12

don't understand how you distinguish Gunn, that

13

said that in these cases, unless a district

14

court has made clear that it is issuing an

15

injunction or prohibiting you from using your

16

map or some portion of your map, that you can't

17

appeal.

18
19
20

And so I still

So could you address the -- our
jurisdiction first?
MR. KELLER:

Sure.

As an initial

21

matter, the district court did not say that we

22

could, in fact, draw additional performing

23

majority/minority districts.

24

Gunn on jurisdiction first.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I'll take

Well, it did at

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6

least in one of the challenges, when there were

2

--

3

MR. KELLER:

Not -- not a performing

4

district.

This would be the Nueces County

5

state house district.

6

plaintiff MALC's own expert testified if we had

7

drawn that additional performing -- if we had

8

drawn that additional majority/minority

9

district, then neither of the districts in

In fact, there, the

10

Nueces County would have performed.

11

have faced vote dilution cracking claims there.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We would

I think that's

13

subject to dispute by your adversary, so let -­

14

let's -- but the point still remains, which is

15

every time you're ordered to change one

16

district, it affects other districts.

17

And in the end, the court, in drawing

18

maps, may find that something it concluded

19

initially is proven wrong by the map drawing.

20

So that goes to why finality requires us to

21

often wait for a remedy -­

22

MR. KELLER:

Well -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- before we

24

permit appeal.

So tell me why that's not true

25

-- why that's not the case under Gunn.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

MR. KELLER:

Well, first of all, in

2

Gunn, what the district court did is it

3

expressly stayed its own ruling, and then for

4

months later, it issued no further order.

5

Here, in quite stark contrast, a mere

6

21 and 13 days after the district court entered

7

its order, it was ordering the state to appear

8

for expedited court-drawn redistricting.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

It asked the

10

legislator to tell it whether it intended to do

11

redrawing.

12

just said, do you intend to?

13

even started the process.

14

to one prong of effectively final.

15

It didn't order it to do it.

It

And it hadn't

But that goes only

The other prong is, could you have

16

gotten relief at the end of this process?

17

were granted a stay within less than two weeks

18

of your filing -- filing a motion.

19

you had gone through the remedial stage, you

20

still would have had time to use your maps for

21

the next election.

22

MR. KELLER:

You

So, even if

Well, not in orderly

23

appellate review.

And, here, we're in the same

24

practical position as Cooper and as in Gill,

25

where what happened was district courts

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

invalidated districts and then told the states

2

you had to redistrict, but those courts did not

3

impose remedial maps.

4

appellate jurisdiction.

6

And yet, there was
Here -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

Go ahead.

I

mean, that's -­

7

MR. KELLER:

And, moreover, here -­

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. KELLER:

Yeah.

-- what distinguishes

10

this case from virtually all other cases that

11

the Court has had is we were ordered to do

12

expedited redistricting on the eve of election

13

deadlines.

14

We had told -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

You weren't ordered.

15

I mean, that's the problem.

16

judge in 1981, one of the first things that I

17

was told by the preexisting -- Lee Kemp, he

18

said, when you get an appeal, they are

19

appealing from a piece of paper called a

20

judgment, or they are appealing from a piece of

21

paper that says injunction motion denied, or

22

possibly granted.

23

When I became a

What does the piece of paper say here?

24

It seems to me the piece of paper says come to

25

court.

Now, if we're going to call that a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

grant of an injunction, we're going to hear

2

50,000 appeals from the 93 -- however many

3

three-judge courts there are.

4

says, when you come to court, have a plan.

5

And it also

Now I grant you there won't be 90,000

6

appeals; there will only be 40,000.

7

but, still, you see the point.

8

order, the sentence, the piece of paper that

9

says injunction denied or says injunction

10

But -­

What is the

granted from which there is an appeal?

11

MR. KELLER:

Well, there is no magic

12

word "injunction" used in these orders, but

13

under Carson -­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't say magic

15

word.

16

order?

17

four words, and it is, in effect, saying -- is

18

it the one that says stay denied?

19

granted?

20

I'm driving at?

21

I said, what is the piece of paper, the
Read it to me.

It probably only has

Produce some papers?

MR. KELLER:

Sure.

Stay

You see what

For instance,

22

C.J.S. Appendix 118a, the court said the

23

violations "now require remedy" and "must be

24

remedied either by the Texas legislature or

25

this court."

The court ordered us -- if the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

governor was not going to call a special

2

session, the legislature was not in session

3

within 72 hours, then we were ordered to take

4

immediate steps to consult with experts and

5

mapdrawers, prepare statewide congressional

6

plans, we were meeting -­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

order.

9

mapdrawers.

That's it.

It is the

You are ordered to consult with

10

All right?

That is an injunction.

Now, if that's an injunction, that's

11

my concern.

12

injunction, you are ordered to consult with

13

mapdrawers, unless some other thing happens.

14

All right?

15

If you're going to call that an

Now why won't that open the door to

16

you are ordered to be in court tomorrow

17

morning?

18

Okay?

19

You are ordered to produce a witness?

That's what I'm worried about.
MR. KELLER:

Well, because the

20

practical effect of that order here was

21

blocking us from using the maps in the 2018

22

elections.

23

that we could somehow have used the maps in the

24

2018 elections.

25

And plaintiffs do not seriously say

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, General, I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

that that might well be true, but I think it's

2

-- it's also true in pretty much all of these

3

districting cases.

4

these districting cases, once there's a

5

liability finding, there's a finding that a

6

particular district is -- is drawn or more than

7

one district is drawn in a way that violates

8

the Constitution, the upshot of that is that

9

you're not going to be allowed to use those

10
11

In other words, in all of

district lines.
But still there's a remedial process

12

that takes place, where people argue about what

13

the proper remedy is, and only at the end of

14

that process, customarily, or at least it

15

happened this way here, is there an injunction

16

put in place saying don't use this map, instead

17

use that map.

18

And what I'm concerned about is that

19

if you're right, we're going to be hearing all

20

of these districting cases not after the

21

remedial stage but, instead, straight away

22

after the liability stage.

23

MR. KELLER:

Well, first of all, as an

24

initial matter, many of these cases would come

25

to the court in a preliminary injunction

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

posture.

2

into the case after three trials and two

3

appeals to this Court.

4

Here, of course, we're seven years

But, more importantly, we would have

5

faced contempt if we would have told the

6

district court, no, we are not going to engage

7

in the redistricting that you have ordered on

8

an expedited basis.

9

this case from virtually any -­

10

And what distinguishes

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's quite

11

-- that's quite odd.

12

of not participating and simply letting the

13

court draw the map.

14

MR. KELLER:

You always had the choice

No.

We -- we did not.

15

Here, we were ordered to not only appear but to

16

bring our own Texas Legislative Council

17

employees with us for the court to do expedited

18

map drawing.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You still -- well,

20

it hasn't happened, but you could have had a -­

21

an appeal from that.

22

MR. KELLER:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

My point -­
That's what -­
My point goes back

to -­
MR. KELLER:

We are taking an appeal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

from that today.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What you're now

3

saying to us is we have an appeal after the

4

preliminary injunction.

5

declared unconstitutional -- a map is declared

6

unconstitutional, we have an appeal.

7

Every time a law is

And then we have a third appeal at the

8

end of a remedy.

So automatically, because I

9

don't see how to distinguish this from Gunn

10

still, and I still don't know how to

11

distinguish it from the millions of others -­

12

not millions, I'm exaggerating greatly -- from

13

the hundreds of these that we have received

14

where a court has said something's

15

unconstitutional and we have said that doesn't

16

end the case.

17

What ends the case is the final

18

injunction that imposed -- that stops you from

19

doing something and requires you to do

20

something else.

21

MR. KELLER:

Well, but we were in the

22

same posture as Cooper and Gill and there were

23

not remedial maps there.

24

Gunn -­

25

And here, unlike in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's in 1291.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

I'm talking about 1253.

2

automatically -­

What you're saying is

3

MR. KELLER:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

giving me any way to distinguish any

6

three-court decision on liability that doesn't

7

result in an immediate appeal.

8
9

But -­
-- you're not

You're basically saying every single
one of them, where a court says even one

10

district was drawn wrong, that that's

11

immediately appealable.

12

MR. KELLER:

Well, but that would have

13

been Cooper and Gill.

14

highlights that redistricting itself is

15

different.

16

certain districts invalid but then telling the

17

state you must redistrict, that itself,

18

particularly in this case when we were ordered

19

21 and 13 days later to come with Texas

20

Legislative Council employees to engage in

21

expedited redistricting -­

22

And I think this

When a court is not only declaring

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that goes back

23

to Justice Breyer's question.

I don't think

24

that ever ordering someone to come to court and

25

give an explanation has been considered a final

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

order.

2

MR. KELLER:

Well, we -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What is considered

4

a final order is a contempt finding, something

5

else that happens as a result of your failure

6

to act, not the request for you to come to

7

court.

8
9

MR. KELLER:

Well, but unlike in Gunn,

for instance, here -- in Gunn, the district

10

court stayed its own order and took no

11

additional action for months.

12

court here, when we moved for a stay in the

13

district court, clarified:

14

your maps for the 2018 elections, that would be

15

a very different case.

16

exact opposite.

17
18

21

State, you can use

But instead it did the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But we don't know

that -­

19
20

If the district

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, if -- if I

JUSTICE ALITO:

What would have

could -­

22

happened if you had told the district court,

23

well, fine, you've issued an opinion, but we're

24

going ahead and we're going to conduct

25

elections under the map that was adopted by the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

state legislature?

2

MR. KELLER:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

We -­
What would have

happened?

5

MR. KELLER:

We would have been held

6

in contempt for not obeying this order.

7

didn't have to suffer the threat of contempt to

8

be able to appeal.

9

And we

And when we moved for a stay in this

10

Court, we informed the Court that we needed to

11

know by October 1, 2017, what the status of our

12

districts were.

13

And we told the Court, grant us a stay

14

by then, grant us a stay earlier, treat our

15

stay motion as a petition for a writ of

16

mandamus.

17

of this case, and the Court granted a stay.

18

We were very clear about the status

And even then, when the circuit

19

justice issued a temporary stay in this case,

20

the district court issued an advisory informing

21

the parties they could voluntarily comply so

22

that redistricting could resume expeditiously,

23

to use the district court's words.

24
25

If I can turn from the jurisdictional
issue now to the merits.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, if I could -­

2

I'm sorry.

3

saying before you were interrupted, you said

4

what distinguishes this case, and I guess I do

5

want to know what does distinguish this case,

6

or is -- if in finding that there's

7

jurisdiction here, are we going to be finding

8

that there's jurisdiction after the liability

9

stage at all redistricting cases?

10

But I guess I -- you -- you were

MR. KELLER:

Not -- no, Justice Kagan.

11

If a court simply says -- declares districts

12

invalid and then issues no other injunction and

13

says the state doesn't have to redistrict, that

14

is a different case.

15

ahead and says the state must redistrict, and

16

here on an expedited basis on the eve of

17

election deadlines that all the parties

18

conceded existed, that's the practical effect

19

of an injunction.

But when the court goes

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Counsel -­

One more question

22

and then you have to get to the merits.

23

Suppose there had been a 45-day window.

24

that have been a practical effect of an

25

injunction?

We can play the -- the game

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Would

Official
18
1
2

between 3 and 45.
MR. KELLER:

Sure.

Justice Kennedy, I

3

think so, because this Court's precedent, Wise

4

versus Lipscomb, says that there must be a

5

reasonable opportunity for the legislature to

6

have to correct any deficiencies in the map,

7

when a part-time legislature is out of session

8

and a court is putting the state's -- the

9

sovereign authority of use it or lose it only

10

within 45 days, I -- I think that would still

11

be practically an injunction, but, again, here,

12

it was nothing close to 45 days.

13

It was within three days the governor

14

had to call a special session.

15

certainly not a reasonable opportunity.

16
17
18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's

I have a

question on the merits.
You put a lot of weight on the

19

adoption in 2013 of the court-drawn 20 -- what,

20

2012, 2011?

21

MR. KELLER:

2012.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2012 plan.

23

And I -- I think a concern, though, is that the

24

district court plan was not comprehensive.

25

-- it was put in quickly based -- it was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It

Official
19
1

preliminary, as opposed to permanent.

2
3

And I wonder if that undermines the
weight you can place on it?

4

MR. KELLER:

Well, I don't think so,

5

Mr. Chief Justice, for three reasons:

6

all, there was plenty of process in the court

7

in 2011 and 2012.

8

preliminary injunction posture.

9

injunctions had been granted in 2011.

10

First of

This was not actually a
Preliminary

The only reason that a lower standard

11

was being used here is because there were

12

collateral Section 5 proceedings, because this

13

was the unique posture where Section 5

14

preclearance proceedings were ongoing.

15

here, the procedure in the district court, we

16

had discovery.

17

And,

There were dispositive motions.

We had two weeks of trial.

There was

18

an appeal to this Court with its Perry

19

decision.

20

before and after this Court's decision in

21

Perry.

22

the district of D.C.

23

of argument on remand.

24
25

There was extensive briefing both

There was the Section 5 briefing before
There were two more days

And then, at that point, the district
court in 2012 issued tens of pages of written

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

findings and conclusions imposing those maps

2

that actually change nine congressional

3

districts and 28 state house districts.

4

In that context, particularly after

5

this Court said six different times to the

6

district court it was under a mandate to draw

7

lawful districts, and then, when the district

8

court expressly said it obeyed that mandate,

9

discrimination with respect to some, that found

questionable some of the claims and reasons

4

that were given by the legislature for these

districts.

6

There were serious questions raised by

7

the D.C. circuit court.

So the -- this Court

basically said when it ruled:

This is

It's been done hurriedly.

You

10

12

But the D.C. district court made

13

findings contrary to your position.

14

-- wouldn't -- aren't we obligated to look at

15

the full picture, not just the picture you want

MR. KELLER:

So should

The D.C. court, though,

19

did not find issues with the districts that had

20

been validated.

21

counsel MALDEF told the legislature that the

22

court-ordered maps, the 2012 court-ordered maps

23

from the district court in San Antonio fixed

24

every district where even Section 5

25

preclearance was denied.

Indeed, in 2011, plaintiff's

So what the evidence that the

legislature heard in 2013 was that the maps had

5

been fixed even beyond the analysis that the

court performed, also, to address plaintiff's

argument that somehow the process was rushed in

That is clearly erroneous.

And so, to turn that around and to say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

essentially to stop every case at the

3

MR. KELLER:

Justice Kagan, our

4

position is not that somehow this was a

5

categorical safe harbor, that the 2011

6

legislature's actions could not be examined.

7

But what can't happen is that only 2011 is

8

examined in isolation.

9

in 2011.

10

This case did not end

Indeed, what happened in 2012 with all

11

that court process, and in 2013 with the

12

legislative process adopting a court-ordered

13

remedial district, is very good evidence that

14

the legislature was acting in good faith.

15

you would need very persuasive evidence to

16

overcome the strong presumption of good faith,

17

the extraordinary caution that would apply when

18

charging a legislature with an illicit purpose.

19

And, here, essentially nothing changed

And

20

between 2012 and 2014.

21

almost no new evidence that came in even on

22

retrial compared to what the district court was

23

aware of in 2012 when it had the entire 2011

24

legislative record before it.

25

Plaintiffs point to

In that context, with or without a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25

presumption of good faith, there is no basis to

2

find that the Texas legislature was somehow

3

invidiously racially discriminatory when what

4

it did is it adopted the entire congressional

map and virtually all the state house map that

6

it had been ordered to use.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. KELLER:

No, I -- I believe that's

a very different case -­

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

MR. KELLER:

I know it is.

-- precisely because -­

6

and -- and under Arlington Heights, the court

7

could consider all of that evidence, and in

8

doing that analysis of the sequence of events,

9

the court could take cognizance of the fact

10

that the 2013 legislature there may not have

11

been doing anything at all, and that could

12

possibly go to the purpose.

13

But here, when we have a court-ordered

remedial plan and we have wholesale acceptance

on the congressional side and virtually

wholesale acceptance on the state house side,

far from sufficient time to allow a sovereign

that might be true.

It might have been a

25

terrible decision to give only three days, but

question of whether something is an injunction

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

urgency or time limit is -- is -- is a very

important consideration, in fact, a very

important limitation on what we are proposing

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

you have about five minutes left.

4

move to the merits?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Mr. Kneedler,
Could you

I -- I'd like to.

6

And -- and the -- for us, the critical point to

7

be made here is that the question of whether

8

the 2013 plan enacted by the state legislature

9

was impermissibly discriminatory turns on the

10
11

intent of the legislature in 2013.
And this Court has said repeatedly

12

that there is a presumption of good faith with

13

respect to a legislative enactment, and that is

14

true even if a prior legislative enactment had

15

been found to be impermissibly discriminatory.

16

Here, the presumption of good faith is

17

particularly strong because, as has been

18

discussed, the district court in this case,

19

following this Court's careful instructions,

20

examined the 2011 plan and determined which

21

ones did not pass the not insubstantial test

22

that this Court articulated or there was not a

23

likelihood of success.

24

leave the other ones in place.

25

And this Court said to

The court had extensive proceedings at

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

And that in our view gave -­

2

would have reinforced the proposition that the

3

state legislature could rely upon that, and it

4

-- it -- it certainly doesn't suggest any -­

5

any impermissible intent on the part of the

6

state legislature.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

So how -­

But, Mr. Kneedler, in

-- in your briefs, you acknowledge two things.

10

You acknowledge, first, that when there are two

11

maps and they're exactly the same, that

12

evidence of intent as to the first map is

13

probative of -- of -- of intent as to the

14

second map.

15

to the second map, but if two maps are exactly

16

the same, there's all kinds of evidence of bad

17

intent as to the first map, surely that's

18

probative.

19
20
21
22
23

The question is always intent as

And I think you acknowledge that.
Don't you think?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Again, depending on -­

depending on the circumstances, but -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Of course.

Everything

24

depends on the circumstances.

The -- the -­

25

the facts, which, you know, this Court is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1
2

-- has principal authority over.
The second thing that you acknowledge

3

in your brief is that these court orders,

4

especially at this preliminary stage, are not

5

safe harbors.

6

Don't you think?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Oh, we absolutely agree

7

they are not safe harbors.

They could try to

8

prove a -- a intentional discrimination claim.

9

The results test under the Voting Rights Act

10

remains available as well, and that, in fact,

11

is the principal vehicle for challenging

12

redistricting.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, given that the

14

district court has so much better understanding

15

of the facts than we do, what do you think went

16

wrong here?

17

principle that went wrong.

18

I'm trying to find the legal

MR. KNEEDLER:

The -- the legal

19

principle that went wrong is the court

20

basically said that the taint that it found in

-- with respect to certain districts in 2011

22

But the important point is that the -­

the -- it's the intent in 2013 and the desire

to -- to accept what the district court did so

6

that the state could move on.

7

It didn't end the litigation, but so

8

that the state could move on is, again,

something that is to be encouraged when a

that rather than to continue to resist it.

MR. HICKS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

I hadn't anticipated doing this, but

20

I'm going to start with the jurisdictional

21

question, which, of course, is what you all

22

start with.

23

Justice Breyer asked a key question, I

25

He said, show me the language.

Show me where

Heritage Reporting Corporation

they entered an injunction.

2

The closest they can come, there -­

3

everybody agrees there was no remedy ordered,

so the only question becomes was there an

5

injunction against the 2018 elections for

6

Congress -- I'm speaking of Congress -- going

7

forward under the existing plan.

8
9

The closest they can come to an -­
language that says there is an injunction, is

10

the language that says these violations that

11

we've just found and declared must be remedied.

12

But that's not an injunction.

13

It doesn't say when, how.

It gives no

14

details.

the injunction question, the language is in the

court's order and in its response to -­

15

not going to be able to use the 2018 plans?

16

So

And, I mean, if you were the

MR. HICKS:

No, I would not at all.

17

First of all, that three-day window was a -- a

18

chance for the -- the legislature -- the

19

governor to come back and say, I will call the

20

legislature in special session.

21

about when he would call them into session.

22

It wasn't

We had asked -- the court had, rather,

23

had said two different times in the spring of

24

2017 to the Texas Attorney General's Office,

25

you should consider having the legislature -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

the first time it was in special -- in regular

2

session -- you should consider having them

3

address the -- the problems that have cropped

4

up so far in the districts that didn't change

5

between 2011 and 2013.

6

No response.

Silence from the state.

7

Then, about two or three weeks later, after

8

this Court's decision in Cooper came down, the

9

court again said:

Hey, kind of the

10

handwriting's on the wall here for problems

11

with your districts that didn't change.

12

should consider calling a special session.

13

Will -- will you?

This was in the spring.

15

didn't do it.

16

a definite answer:

17

You

And they

In fact, at that time, they got
No, we won't do it.

So, when the time came in the August

18

order that said we find violations, we've

19

gotten to the point now after all these years

20

and we find violations in these two districts,

21

the court did not say you can't conduct the

22

elections.

The court did not say that you only

jurisdiction, that there is no injunction, what

happens next?

5

MR. HICKS:

If you're -- if

Well, I can tell you what

we hope happens next.

If -- if the Court

7

dismisses this case for lack of jurisdiction,

8

and we -- I have not consulted with every one

9

of the nine groups, but if -- if for our group,

10

if the Court says no jurisdiction and sends it

11

back, we're going to ask the court to set up a

12

remedy hearing and see if we might be able to

13

get relief in time for the 2018 elections.

There is a very good chance, I think a

15

pretty strong chance, the court -- the district

court is not going to let us do that.

Do you think we lack

word "injunction" or "order" but has the

practical effect of doing that?

answer.

do not have jurisdiction unless it has an

injunction in it in so many words.

20

that's true.

21

The first answer is yes, I believe you

I believe

If the practical effects test that the

22

Court has applied in Carson Brands, which I

23

emphasize is only as to the denial of an

24

injunction, not to the grant, which has to be

25

much more specific, but if that practical

Heritage Reporting Corporation

48

effects test is applied, there has to be

2

something that indicates there is injunctive

relief forthcoming.

4

forthcoming; rather, there is injunctive relief

embedded in this.

look at something and tell if it's an

7

injunction or not.

11

That is -- not

This Court knows to how to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Has -- has the

practical effects been applied in the 1253
context as distinguished from 1292?
MR. HICKS:

It never has.

And I think

12

the Gunn case suggests if -- if that principle

13

is followed, it wouldn't be applied.

14

to remember in the -- the Carson Brands test,

15

calling it the -- the practical effects test,

16

is really ultimately a misnomer because, if you

17

look at it, in Carson Brands, what had happened

was the district court had refused to enter a

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

On the -- on

the merits, it seems a strong argument, which

13

you dismiss as just sort of wanting to end the

14

litigation, which is usually a good thing, for

15

the legislature to say:

16

plan, I understand it's preliminary and all

17

that, but to move things along, this is the

18

plan the district court drew.

19

we're going to go with.

20

Okay, this is the

That's what

It does seem to me that at the very

21

least, and I understand this to be the point on

22

the other side, that ought to give them some

23

presumption of good faith moving forward, which

24

is significant on the determination of their

25

intent to discriminate.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

MR. HICKS:

Right.

That isn't what

2

gave them the presumption of good faith.

They

3

always have a presumption of good faith when

4

the legislature acts.

5

is presume good faith.

6

proceeded from that.

7

instance, the district court did not in 2012

8

draw a map.

That's the first step,
And the district court
But, in this particular

It did not draw a map.

9

For the two districts that are before

you now, Districts 25 and -- I mean 35 and 27,

it didn't touch them.

district court could draw a map; you don't have

to change every single district when you're -­

16

you're looking at what you think is an

17

appropriate map for two -- two elections to go

18

forward under.

19

MR. HICKS:

Well, they

I understand that, but in

20

this one, there were -- half of the Texas

21

congressional districts were not touched in the

22

interim map, not touched at all, including

23

these two -­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does -- is

your answer different if they did alter every

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

single district in Texas?

2

MR. HICKS:

Well, my answer is it

3

would then be a court-drawn map in the

4

districts, and it would be court-drawn.

5

these two districts were not court-drawn, as

6

well as 16 other districts there were not

7

court-drawn.

8

10
11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

How -- how -­

how many of the Texas districts were redrawn or
altered?
MR. HICKS:

Only -- there were -­

12

there are 36 districts; 18 of them were altered

13

in some way and 18 of them were untouched.

14

it's half and half.

15

that were untouched, you go look at the 2011

16

legislation that drew them, and you find the

17

block descriptions of what they look like, the

18

geographic description.

19

there in 2011.

20

So

And I -- and though the 18

It's the statute is

And so -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, as to the

21

district -- as to the congressional districts

22

that are at issue here to start, did the

23

district court simply rubber-stamp what had

24

been presented to it, or did it engage in a

25

pretty thorough, thoughtful analysis of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

legality of those districts?

2

MR. HICKS:

It did as thorough an

3

analysis, I believe, as it could under the

4

constraints.

5

analysis.

6

And that is not a thorough

The court itself said it's not

7

thorough.

As -- if Your Honors recall, this

8

case returned to them, and it isn't as though

9

the court on remand had a choice.

There was a

10

gap.

11

preclearance regime was in place and operative,

12

and there had to be a map in place.

13

At that time, preclearance -- the

There could not be one.

This Court

14

had already postponed -- the district court had

15

already postponed elections two or three -­

16

scheduled two or three times.

17

court in D.C. had not yet acted on the state's

18

preclearance request.

And the district

So there was a gap.

19

And it had to go forward.

20

and to talk about the analysis, the district

21

court -- and the Texas Legislative Council's

22

lawyer did tell the legislature this -- the

23

district court, it's hard to find a more hedged

24

opinion about the outcome of a case.

25

And the -­

They said it's a close question.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official
53
1

don't know how many times they said it's a

2

close question.

3

the state, when it came up here to -- before

4

think it was, the -- the state told you:

8
9

It's for this time only.

And

Hey,

It's just

We quote that in our brief.

And so it is -- it is not what I would
call a thorough analysis.

There were things

10

that changed, substantial things that changed

But the -- there were several things

17

that changed.

One, as Justice Sotomayor said,

18

there was the district court in D.C. decision

19

which said there is, essentially, more

20

intentional discrimination in this

21

congressional map than you can shake a stick

22

at.

23

said there is a preexisting crossover district

24

in the Travis County area that the district

25

court in San Antonio had not found existed yet.

We -- we have had evidence on that.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

They

Official
54
1

They said there is a crossover district where

2

people -- minority voters' rights are being

3

exercised.

4

Also, in between, the United States

5

had intervened in a different posture back

6

then.

7

opposed the map in D.C., and that evidence had

8

been introduced.

9

that didn't exist in 2012.

The United States had intervened and

10

That was all new evidence

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why don't you talk

about Congressional District 35 and some of the

13

points that the district court made when it

initially analyzed this.

15

Why don't we talk

Is it not true that this -- this -­

16

the concept of this district was recommended by

17

the Mexican-American Legal Defense and

18

Education Fund and supported by the Latino

19

Redistricting Task Force?

20

MR. HICKS:

The concept was one of two

alternatives.

It was April 11th testimony,

April 11, 2011, if you -- transcript -­

23

Exhibit 591, if I recall correctly.

24

goes in early in the session and says:

25

two maps.

MALDEF
We have

One is a concept similar to this,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

and the other one is an alternative map that

2

does what we think should have happened.

3

they say we don't have a choice between them.

4

And they offered no -­

5
6

JUSTICE ALITO:

But they recommended

this as one of the alternatives, right?

7
8

And

MR. HICKS:

Right.

It is, but there

was -­

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Linking -- linking San

10

Antonio and -- and Austin, and they said there

11

was a community of interest.

12

court said that in its initial opinion, did it

13

not?

14

MR. HICKS:

And the district

It said it didn't know for

15

sure whether there was a community of interest.

16

But the important thing about this is there was

17

no evidence -- under a racial gerrymandering

18

test, they have to survive strict scrutiny.

19

And so, on the strict scrutiny side, the Texas

20

legislature had nothing -- nothing in front of

21

it that suggested that there was problem with

22

racially polarized voting that would require

23

the creation of this district.

24

have -- it isn't that they didn't have -­

whether they had strong evidence or not; they

They didn't

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought there was

3

evidence that there was racially polarized

4

voting in the district as a whole.

5

MR. HICKS:

There is -- the state

6

offered no evidence at all on that.

7

offered no evidence.

The state

We offered evidence.

do post-hoc investigation of whether there's a

problem; you look at it at the time the

But the most important fact, Your

Honors, the most important fact the legislature

13

had in front of it in 2013 that it didn't have

14

in 2011 was that the elections had occurred

15

under that map, and what did the legislature

know in 2013 that it didn't know in 2011, that

what it had intended to do -- what it had

Just briefly, Your Honor.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

You've got a

couple more minutes too.

7

MR. HICKS:

Okay.

Just briefly on

8

this point, I would like to wrap up with this

9

in -- in -- in -- on this very point.

In -­

10

about a week ago, in the Dimaya case, this

11

Court repeated a quip -- I guess you can call

12

it a quip -- from Justice Scalia, and it said

13

insanity is doing the same thing over and over

14

again and expecting a different result.

15

Well, the Texas legislature is not

16

insane.

It knows -- it -- it knows how to do

17

redistricting maps and we believe it knows how

18

to do them, too, fairly well with respect to

19

diminishing minority voting rights.

20

So I would ask the Court to look at it

this way:

If you've done it in 2011 and you

the same thing over and over again and

expecting and achieving exactly the same

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON J. RIGGS

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES IN NO. 17-626
MS. RIGGS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

This Court does not have jurisdiction

11

to hear this appeal, but if it proceeds to the

12

merits, the district court properly applied the

13

Arlington Heights framework to analyze the

14

intent of the 2013 legislature in reenacting

15

some of the same state house districts it had

16

deliberately designed in 2011 to cancel out or

17

minimize the voting strength of black and

18

Latino voters in Texas.

19

And using that correct legal standard,

20

the district court concluded that the intent of

21

the legislature in 2013 was, in fact, to

22

maintain and perpetuate its ill-gotten and

23

racially discriminatory 2011 gains.

24

findings cannot be deemed clearly erroneous on

25

the grounds of this entire record, which is

Those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

quite voluminous.
The jurisdictional question has been

3

discussed quite a bit.

4

like to add to what's already been mentioned.

5

There's one gloss I'd

First is that the rule in Gunn, which

6

is -- is restrictive and doesn't create any

7

exceptions, has been applied in a redistricting

8

case in Whitcomb.

9

for Gunn being read as we urge it to be read.

10

So there's precedent for -­

And then there's the practical

11

consequence of not affording a restrictive

12

reading to 1253.

13

involve timing and all election deadlines start

14

at different times.

15

All redistricting cases

This invites manipulation to create

16

exceptions in -- under 1253 and in

17

redistricting cases, and the exception would

18

eat the rule.

19

Then turning to the merits.

I think

20

it's helpful to look at the district court's

21

analysis of what the evidence in 2013 and all

22

of the evidence in front of it as falling into

23

buckets that match up with the Arlington

24

Heights framework.

25

you look at the district court's opinion,

And I submit to you that if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

there's three obvious buckets of evidence that

2

it identifies.

3

One relates to the 2011 redistricting

4

plans for state house.

5

analysis of the actual motivation of the

6

legislature compared to its proffered motive -­

7

motive -- offered justification.

8

process problems with respect to 2013 that

9

could give rise to an inference of

10

Another is the -- an

And third is

discriminatory intent.

11

I want to start with that 2011 bucket

12

because it provides several pieces of relevant

13

information under the Arlington Heights

14

framework.

15

First, the effect of a redistricting

16

plan is, under Arlington Heights, an important

17

place to start, and the district court made

18

extensive findings about the discriminatory

19

effect that the 2011 House plan would have.

20

And, as Mr. Hicks mentioned, the

21

legislature knew in 2013 that the intended

22

effect had, in fact, manifested.

23

2011 process and facts also provide historical

24

evidence of discrimination, not historical

25

evidence 10 years ago, 15 years ago.

The -- the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, has there -- has

2

there ever been appellate review of the

3

district court's determination -- findings as

4

to the 2011 plan?

5

we should just accept those findings as givens?

6

If you're going to place a lot of weight on

7

them, would we not have to review those?

8
9

Do you -- do you think that

MS. RIGGS:

They would be subject to a

clearly erroneous standard.

As I understand

10

it, Texas challenges that the review of the

11

2011 plans was moot.

12

13

actual factual findings made by the district

14

court, which were quite extensive.

It should have never

But doesn't seriously contest the

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, we can ask

17

General Keller that on rebuttal, but I didn't

18

understand them to say that we agree that all

19

of the findings that were made as to the 2011

20

plan were correct, and we don't wish to -- we

21

-- we -- we accept them all.

22

MS. RIGGS:

I'm certain they don't

23

accept them.

But based on 300 pages of factual

24

findings with respect to the intent and effect

25

of the challenged 2011 House districts, it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

would be very hard to challenge those findings

2

as clearly erroneous.

3

I also think the 2011 evidence is

4

properly conceived of as part of the -- the

5

sequence of events that led up to the 2013

6

challenged legislation; that is, the same

7

people doing the same thing in 2011 as they did

8

in 2013 can be viewed as part of the same

9

process.

10

The -- the district court didn't have

11

to issue a separate opinion with respect to the

12

2011 plan.

13

together as one process, and the 2011 findings

14

-- so the 2011 findings fall under numerous

15

Arlington Heights frameworks.

They could have combined that all

16

I want to spend a few minutes talking

17

about specific districts, though, because what

18

the district court sussed out was a troubling

19

pattern that repeats what this Court saw last

20

redistricting cycle from Texas.

21

Perry all over again.

22

It's LULAC v.

In House District 105 in Dallas

23

County, Latino voters were 19 votes shy from

24

electing their candidate of choice in the

25

district.

And the legislature in 2011 went to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

extreme lengths to protect that Anglo incumbent

2

-- incumbent from being held accountable to the

3

growing Latino population in that district.

4

The -- the legislature carved up precincts,

5

pulled every Anglo voter in western Dallas that

6

it could find to pack into 105 and protect the

7

Anglo incumbent, and carving those same

8

precincts pulled out every Latino and black

9

voter from House District 105.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, there's

11

-- there's a difference between pulling out

12

Republicans and pulling out Democrats.

13

shows -- in protecting an incumbent, because,

14

presumably, our law would say you can protect

15

an incumbent if it's race -- if it's based on

16

party lines, but if you're using just race,

17

what findings are there to show that this was

18

race-based as opposed to incumbency-based?

findings were based on the fact that precincts

in numerous versions of the districts before,

because the population growth in Killeen had

pages long.

20

And, importantly, these are hard

questions.

it.

of the evidence to do this very delicate

balancing.

starting point.

And a unanimous three-judge panel

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

All right.

You -- a

12

lot of complaints have to do with vote

13

dilution, and that's what you've been focused

14

on in a number of districts.

15

about House District 90, for example, where,

16

when the legislature sought to take into

17

consideration some concerns along those lines,

it -- it then gets attacked from the other

direction as -- as discriminating on the basis

of race, in violation of the Fourteenth

cases and making sure that when it does use

race in a predominant fashion, it does it in a

22

narrowly tailored sense.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what is your

24

evidence that the state adopted the plan

25

previously approved by the court for an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71
1

invidious reason?

2

MS. RIGGS:

The evidence that the

3

district court looked at in -- in arriving at

4

that conclusion and -- and drawing the

5

inference from the evidence in front of it was

6

multiple -- multifaceted.

7

One was that the -- the district court

8

-- the legislature ignored the explicit

9

warnings of the district court that its ruling

10

was preliminary; it wasn't done looking.

The

11

next was that the -- it -- it had in front of

12

it the ruling from the D.C. district court.

13

Now the D.C. district court ruling

14

didn't reach discriminatory purpose with

15

respect to the state house case, but it noted

16

that the -- this -- it listed a bunch of record

17

evidence that it said would support a finding

18

of discriminatory purpose.

19

It also noted that the legislature had

20

-- had the advice of counsel during the

21

legislative committee meetings and floor

22

meetings.

23

And -- and there I would point -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

The advice -- the

24

advice of what?

That it was preliminary?

25

original opinion was preliminary?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official
72
1

MS. RIGGS:

So that's the particular

2

piece of advice from that exhibit that the

3

district court cited, but that exhibit, Joint

4

Exhibit 15.3, contains other advice from

5

legislative counsel, Mr. Archer, in which he

6

explains to members of the committee that House

7

District 54, where minority voters had been

8

fractured, cut in half, and stranded in two

9

Anglo districts, might have a target on its

10

back, and that the legislature, if it wanted to

11

avoid being found guilty of intentional

discrimination, ought to consider reuniting

that -- that district.

Now what's the law?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
74
1

MS. RIGGS:

So the law I think -- that

2

I would point Your Honors to is the Guinn and

3

Lane line of cases where, when a statute is

4

enacted and -- and struck down for being

5

unconstitutional and then reenacted the next

6

year, if it partakes too much of the initial

7

constitutional infirmity, it cannot stand under

8

the Constitution.

9

I would also add, though, that wanting

10

to end the litigation, even if it's coming from

11

a -- a good place, doesn't end the

12

constitutional scrutiny.

13

needs to be only one of the factors, not the

14

only or sole or dominant motivating factor.

15

Racial discrimination

16

wanting to win, doesn't end the constitutional

17

inquiry.

But more importantly, it's not that

20

they wanted to -- it doesn't matter whether

they wanted to end the litigation or not; it

matters how they wanted to end the litigation.

And they wanted to end the litigation by

24

maintaining the discrimination against black

25

and Latino voters, muffling their growing

political voice in a state where black and

2

Latino voters' population is exploding.

3

They're poised to take over in all of these

4

5

to muffle.

6

It was that intent that they wanted

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that -­

7

and that -- don't you have to suggest that that

8

was the intent that the district court had when

9

it imposed the interim plan?

Because keep in

10

mind, this -- this evil intent that you're

11

attributing comes from adopting the plan that

12

the district court adopted and let the

13

elections go forward under for two cycles.

14

MS. RIGGS:

Well, the intent doesn't

15

have to encompass any racial animus.

16

the district court did the best it could with

17

the time it had and the evidence it had.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19
20

I think

But the intent

doesn't have to encompass any racial animus?
MS. RIGGS:

No.

Discrimination -­

21

just -- the discrimination that would fall

22

under the prohibitions of the Fourteenth

23

Amendment doesn't have to come from a deep,

24

hateful place.

25

It has -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not a deep,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
76

hateful place.

2

to be racial -- intentional racial

3

discrimination?

4

hateful.

5

It has to be -- doesn't it have

Which sounds pretty deep and

MS. RIGGS:

I -- I -- intentional

6

racial discrimination certainly attaches where

7

there's a purposeful intent to keep a cohesive

8

minority group from exercising the opportunity

9

to elect their candidate of choice where they

10

might otherwise have it, absent that

11

intervention, but I don't think that's the same

12

thing as racial animus.

13

Very briefly, I would like to note

14

that regardless of what this Court does on the

15

questions of intent, in the House case, we have

16

two districts, two claims that are independent

17

of any intent, and one is House District 90,

18

which I already spoke with -- about with

19

Justice Gorsuch.

20

The other is the Section 2 effects

21

claim in Nueces County, and there the dispute

22

boils down to a very narrow question.

23

no dispute that there's racially-polarized

24

voting and that under a totality of the

25

circumstances, Latino voters in Nueces County

The dispute comes down to, under the

first prong of Gingles, which just requires

5

plaintiffs show that you can draw an additional

6

majority Latino district, the state wants to

7

import an additional requirement into the first

8

prong of Gingles that requires plaintiffs to

9

also prove that the district is performing.

10

And I -- that is not consistent with

11

this Court's recent ruling in Bartlett v.

Strickland.

because a bright line is helpful to the states

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, this would be

20

very important going forward.

21

hold that a -- a state can satisfy its Voting

22

23

where there is a mathematical majority, but

24

that district would not perform for the

you were just saying.

proven when it's been shown that it's possible

to draw two majority Latino districts.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

6

MR. KELLER:

I'll start very briefly

7

with jurisdiction.

You've heard plaintiffs say

8

that they want to now modify the districts for

9

2018.

We've already had our primary elections.

10

And that is precisely why this Court should

11

note jurisdiction now and resolve these issues.

12

I want to start and back up a bit to

13

higher-level points.

14

significant major legal errors here made by the

15

district court.

16

presumption of good faith applied.

17

plaintiffs said that there was.

18

mention of a presumption of good faith.

19

There's not even a mention of presumption of

20

good faith in their congressional red brief.

21

There were three

First, there was no
You heard

There is no

The second major legal error was the

22

Feeney well-accepted standard that to show

23

intentional discrimination you must show that a

24

legislature acted because of race with an

25

intent to harm minorities and minority voting

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
82
1

power.

2

That was not the standard applied, and

3

this brings me to my third major legal error,

4

which was the test applied was the wrong

5

question.

6

though there had been no finding of taint by

7

the district court at that time.

8
9
10
11
12

It was, was taint removed even

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why don't we

remand -­
MR. KELLER:

And also that reversed

the burden -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- then all of

13

this just proves to me that, at best, all you

14

get is a vacate this order and send it back

15

under the right legal test.

16

MR. KELLER:

Well, but in addition to

17

those three major legal errors, there's also

18

the fact that these findings were clearly

19

erroneous.

20

First of all, there is no evidence,

21

and you heard no evidence whatsoever today,

22

that somehow the 2013 legislature was trying to

23

mask an invidious intent that it had either

24

carried over or not.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's a very simple

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
83
1

argument.

You know that what you wanted to do,

2

which was to block Hispanic voters or other

3

voters, and -- and get certain candidates

4

elected, that your own counsel is telling you

5

that in those -- in certain of those districts,

6

that's exactly what you got, and you say we

7

want to get the district court not to change

8

these maps, that that's enough for the

9

three-judge panel to conclude that you wanted

10

to put in place the discriminatory intent and

11

effect.

12

That's the simple argument.

13

MR. KELLER:

But that -- that -- that

14

hinges completely on one Texas Legislative

15

Council member, Jeff Archer.

16

simply testified that there were preliminary

17

findings.

18

"I don't think that you can say that Section 2

19

requires that district."

20

the quote my friend gave.

21

And Jeff Archer

He said, and this is JX 15.3 at 42:

That was referring to

Jeff Archer was simply saying this

22

case, yes, litigation will not end.

And even

23

here, this is a -- it would be passing strange

24

to find intentional discrimination in this case

25

where there is no discriminatory effect.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official
84
1

only place that we could draw an additional

2

majority/minority district is that Nueces

3

County state house map.

4

say that they don't know if it can perform.

And you heard counsel

5

The maps that they presented to the

6

Court, their own expert, plaintiff's expert,

7

MALC, testified and conceded that they -­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. KELLER:

10

Well, I have -­

-- offered a map -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- I have two

11

questions.

On racial gerrymandering, I don't

12

think we've ever required a proof of effect.

13

We've only required that you've intentionally

14

gerrymandered -­

15

MR. KELLER:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

But -­
-- on the basis of

race, is that correct?

18

MR. KELLER:

And I'm referring to

19

Nueces County, and that was a vote dilution

20

effect claim.

21

HD90 -­

22

I'll turn to H -- I'll turn to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right, but

23

then -- but that just answered my question.

24

racial gerrymandering, you don't have to prove

25

it?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

On

Official
85
1

MR. KELLER:

That's right, and I'll

2

turn to racial gerrymandering in HD90, that

3

would be the one district we did change.

4

by the way, if we had changed other districts,

5

then we would have been subjected to all sorts

6

of additional legal challenges, which is

7

exactly why the legislature acted in good faith

8

in adopting the congressional map wholesale and

9

virtually all the State House map.

10

And,

In HD90, we had the best of reasons to

11

believe that we had a valid VRA compliance

12

defense.

13

the district had to be drawn as majority

14

Hispanic.

15

the previous version as majority Hispanic.

In 2011, MALDEF told the legislature

16

In 2012, the district court adopted

In 2013, MALC's counsel told the

17

legislature it had to be adopted as majority

18

Hispanic.

19

title actions after that where the Hispanic

20

candidate narrowly lost and narrowly won.

That's JA 403 to 404a.

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. KELLER:

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

There were

So what room -­

And in this case -­
-- what room is left

24

between our VRA jurisprudence under Section 2

25

and the Fourteenth Amendment?

What space is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
86
1

there?

2

MR. KELLER:

Well, and -- and -- and

3

the breathing space that must be accorded is we

4

-- we only need good reasons.

5
6

And, Mr. Chief Justice, if I may
answer.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MR. KELLER:

9

Sure.

We do not have to have a

perfect analysis ahead of time.

We just need

10

good reasons that we were trying to comply with

11

the VRA.

12

for instance.

And take Congressional District 35,

13

There, we had the best of reasons

14

possible to believe that that had to be a

15

majority/minority district because that's

16

precisely what the district court imposed in

17

2012, saying that that was a valid Section 2

18

district.

19

later, three trials, and two appeals to this

20

Court.

21
22

We would ask this Court to find that
the challenged districts are valid and reverse.

And here we are now seven years
