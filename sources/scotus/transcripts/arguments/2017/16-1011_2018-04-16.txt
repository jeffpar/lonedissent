Mr. Clement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Congress enacted Section 271(f) to

12

address this Court's decision in Deepsouth and

13

to prohibit a specific domestic act of

14

infringement with foreseeable foreign

15

consequences.

16

domestic act, the supply of components from the

17

United States, with a particular intent, that

18

the components be combined abroad in a way

19

that, if it happened in the United States,

20

would constitute infringement.

Congress targeted a specific

21

Congress provided a cause of action

22

for the domestic infringement and provided a

23

damages remedy that guaranteed the victim of

24

the infringement damages adequate to compensate

25

for the infringement.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

The plain text of the Patent Act,

2

therefore, gives the victim of Section 271(f)

3

infringement an entitlement to adequate

4

damages, including lost profits.

5

presumption against extraterritoriality raises

6

no obstacle to that commonsense result.

7

And the

There's no case of this Court that

8

applies the presumption to a damages provision,

9

and there's no case of this Court that applies

10

the presumption in a case of domestic injury

11

caused by domestic consequence -- conduct,

12

rather.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Except there's one

14

feature of this that's -- I mean, it's one -­

15

Congress, in 271(f), wanted the infringer to be

16

liable.

17

doubt about that.

And that's -- that's -- there's no

18

But all of the activity occurs -- not

19

only does the activity occur abroad sweeping

20

the high seas, but the one who is causing the

21

injury is not the infringer; it's the customer

22

of the infringer.

23

like that where -- where you can collect from

24

the infringer on the basis of activity by the

25

customer?

Do we have another situation

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

MR. CLEMENT:

We -- we do, Justice

2

Ginsburg.

3

domestic context is that you can sue the party

4

who's guilty of contributory infringement and

5

get lost profits for what they did, the

6

foreseeable consequences of what they did, even

7

if that's primarily damages that are caused by

8

their downstream direct infringer.

9

The -- the general rule in a

So I think it's helpful actually to

10

think about if this whole case happened on Lake

11

Michigan instead of on the high seas, we could

12

sue ION and only ION, not its customers who

13

practice the patent on Lake Michigan, and we

14

could recover our lost profits damages.

15

Now it's true that, in the domestic

16

case, the parties -- ION's customers who were

17

practicing the patent on Lake Michigan would

18

also be guilty of direct infringement.

19

that's one difference.

20

difference that Congress intended with Section

21

271(f).

And

But that's exactly the

22

They specifically created a form of

23

either contributory or inducement liability,

24

understanding that what was being induced was

25

the combination of components outside the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

United States in a way that would constitute

2

infringement in the United States.

3

Now I do think it's important to

4

recognize, though, that what is the infringing

5

conduct is what ION does in the United States.

6

What the foreign combiners of the components do

7

on the high seas is not infringement of a U.S.

8

patent at all, which is why I think the

9

presumption against extraterritoriality is

10
11

really a misfit here.
And you have to resort to the general

12

principle, which is, in U.S. law, if somebody's

13

injured domestically by domestic conduct,

14

there's no rule that says that, in order to

15

calculate the compensatory damages to make them

16

whole, if you have to include in your

17

calculation some foreign thing, there's no rule

18

against that.

19

If I run over a French citizen on my

20

way to court this morning, I can't say, well, I

21

don't have to pay your hospital bills if

22

they're incurred in France because that would

23

be foreign and the presumption against

24

extraterritoriality -­

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, Mr. -- Mr.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

Clement, though, the difference I wonder -- and

2

I don't know, but I wonder -- might be this:

3

That, as Justice Ginsburg indicated under

4

271(f), fine, you get royalties because it's as

5

if the -- the bits were manufactured here.

6

you don't have a -- a monopoly, a lawful

7

monopoly, to use this technology abroad.

8

doesn't belong to you.

9

patent laws.

10

But

That

That's outside the

And so why would you get lost profits

11

by -- because of a third party's use entirely

12

abroad?

13

damages is the bit that concerns me.

14

difference with the common law rule, for

15

example, might be because of the patent law's

16

territorial limits.

17

That -- the lost profits aspect of the

MR. CLEMENT:

And the

I don't think so,

18

Justice Gorsuch, and here's how I'd respond,

19

which is we're not collecting damages for the

20

combination itself.

21

collecting damages for the foreseeable

22

consequences of the domestic act of

23

infringement.

24
25

What we're doing is we are

And -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, let's -- let's

just segregate out again the -- the royalties,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

put those aside, okay?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Can -- can I -­

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

4

focus on the profits for me, okay?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And just -- just

Okay.
And they arise from

7

a third party's use over which you have no

8

lawful monopoly.

9

the high seas, and so your uses aren't

Your patent doesn't run to

10

protected there.

11

portion of the damages alone.

12

So help me out with that

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

The -- the reason

13

that we can collect those damages, even though

14

that -- that conduct is not proscribed by a

15

U.S. patent, is because it is the reasonably

16

foreseeable result of domestic infringement.

17

And so it's no different from what this Court

18

faced in Dowagiac and Goulds, two century-old

19

cases, where what happened -- if -­

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21
22
23
24
25

This Court -- this

-MR. CLEMENT:

And I see

skepticism creeping -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

All right.

here's the -- here's the degree of my

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Well,

Official
9
1

skepticism.

2

this Court at least where -- even under 271(a)

3

where the manufacture entirely takes place

4

here, third-party uses abroad give rise to lost

5

profit damages.

6

I -- I have yet to see a case from

MR. CLEMENT:

With all due respect,

7

Your Honor, that's Goulds.

8

Canadian sales are allowed as part of the

9

compensation for the domestic making -­

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

In Goulds, the

In passing.

11

Court doesn't even address the issue.

12

use the word "Canadian."

13

So what -­

14

MR. CLEMENT:

The
We -- we

That's all we've got.

But in Dowagiac, when

15

somebody comes into court and says, I can

16

collect my damages against the Canadian

17

wholesaler, because of Goulds, this Court says:

18

Not so fast.

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

20

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

Because you're suing a

21

wholesaler who did nothing in the United

22

States, nothing infringing, and they

23

specifically say that Goulds is different

24

because there the party, the plaintiff -- the

25

patent holder, sued the right party, the party

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

who made the article in the United States and

2

then was guilty of infringement.

3

If I could get to your point about

4

reasonable royalty, though, I think it's very

5

important to show why that's not a way out

6

here, and my friend's concession on page 35 of

7

his brief, that you can take into account the

8

expected foreign use in calculating the rate

9

for the royalty, is a very damaging concession,

10

because reasonable royalties are not some

11

alternative to damages adequate to compensate

12

for the infringement.

13

copyright context, where statutory damages are

14

an alternative to actual damages.

15

This is not like the

Reasonable royalties are just a way of

16

calculating adequate damages.

17

the preferred method when you have a patent

18

holder who voluntarily licenses the technology

19

to third parties.

20

Then you say:

Indeed, they're

Okay, you voluntarily

21

licensed it for 20 cents, the bit.

22

we're going to impose as the reasonable royalty

23

to compensate you for the infringement.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what

All that will

happen -- imagine you have the converse case.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I mean, if we can have a law like this, so can

4

9

10

And now an American firm

And suddenly a foreign patent holder,

11

in, say, Switzerland, had -- takes this

12

American company and obtains enormous profits

13

on the basis of the sales in the United States,

14

where those sales do not violate American law.

15

I mean, suppose 10 countries do this.

16

I try to think about that and I see chaos or

17

confusion.

18

comity is, what happens if everybody does it?

19

And then I become uncertain about whether

20

there's no place for our concern with what

21

happens when we apply American law abroad.

And at that point, I think part of

Well, a couple -­
With effects abroad.

A couple of points,

First of all, this has been

12

the rule for basically 100 years.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know.

I've read

3

the cases and I've read the -- both sides and

4

-- and I think you have an excellent case.

5

they also point out that it's simply a

6

different situation or it's just passing and

7

they did it as -- you've read those too.

8
9
10

And

Okay.

So I -- I -- I -- I -- you get a plus
for that, in my mind, and -- but not a total
plus because they get a plus too.

11

All right.

So -- so I -- I -- I accept the

12

argument, but I think I know the argument.

13

there anything else?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Is

The other thing is, I

15

mean, I -- I would say, you know, I get a

16

couple of pluses because this has also been the

rule -­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. CLEMENT:

These -­

And I think the key is,

4

here's the key, which is in all of these cases

5

what you need to have, before you can have any

6

of this liability, is a determination by the

7

legislature that some domestic act of

8

infringement is sufficiently serious that we're

9

going to provide full compensation, even if

10

that has some foreseeable increase abroad.

11

And if that creates some situation

12

where some country has a very idiosyncratic

13

view of what constitutes infringement, then

14

maybe governments -­

It's not

But -­
I mean, there -­

there are different views all over the world.
Now what's bothering me are not the

22

cases, but I can't find that they are in your

23

favor 100 percent.

24

right, that they're not clearly on your side.

25

They're -- they may be open.

So let's assume that I'm

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

What's bothering me is the practical

2

problem that I brought up before of what

3

happens in respect to third-party behavior

4

where they are not violating the law and

5

damages are here, are calculated on the basis

6

of that.

7

if 20 countries do that?

8
9

What happens if 10 countries do that,

I see three possible ways of trying to
deal with the problem.

One way is what they

10

want.

Another way is through the notion of

11

proximate cause, because there's a D.C. case,

12

after Empagran, that takes that route.

13

there may be a -- a -- a third route.

14

know.

15

And
I don't

I'm posing a practical problem and

16

asking you what, if anything, you want to

17

respond with.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

I want to respond with

19

two things, Your Honor:

20

understand the concern to be double damages, I

21

think there are ways -­

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

First of all is, if I

No, it's not double

23

damages.

It is the chaos that would ensue if

24

10 countries have the same rule that you are

25

advocating.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

MR. CLEMENT:

With all due respect,

2

there would be no chaos.

3

principal response.

4

chaos in some context if this were really a

5

problem.

6

And that is my

And we would have seen

And the reason we don't see chaos is

7

because every country, in order for there to be

8

the domestic act of infringement, has to say,

9

look, there's something about this that we

10

really don't want to happen in the United

11

States, and, if it happens in the United

12

States, we want to provide damages that make

13

the victim whole.

14

And I think it's a little odd to think

15

of every country doing this because my friend

16

on the other side concedes that you can have an

17

injunctive remedy to prohibit this kind of

18

domestic supply.

19

remedy, it wouldn't happen at all.

20

foreign combinations would not have happened.

21

And if you got the injunctive
These

And so the principle of damages that's

22

been around in the common law forever, and

23

hasn't caused international friction, is

24

there's no special rule when somebody injures

25

somebody domestically that says you can't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

possibly look at any foreign evidence in order

2

to evaluate what would it take to put the party

3

back in the position they were.

4

I mean, at some level, this case is

5

pretty simple.

6

of infringement, my client has $90 million less

7

in its wallet in Houston than it otherwise

8

would have if they had obeyed the law.

9

Because of ION's domestic act

And there's nothing in the presumption

10

of extraterritoriality or concerns about

11

comity.

12

Empagran, unlike Kiobel, unlike many of this -­

13

unlike Morrison, unlike many of these Court's

14

cases, there are no foreign governments filing

15

briefs here telling you, boy, would this be a

16

problem if this happens.

17

I do think it is telling that, unlike

And I think that's, A, because it's

18

not a problem.

19

would be more of a problem if the rule were the

20

other way.

21

And in some ways, I mean, it

I think you would have more comity.

I mean, if you were to tell me that if

22

I hit the French Ambassador with my car in

23

Philadelphia that I'd pay less in damages than

24

I otherwise would because he's French and he's

25

probably going to have his medical bills paid

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

by a French hospital, I would say:

2

think the French are going to be very pleased

3

about that.

4

I don't

I think they would think, no, there is

5

a domestic injury here and you compensate it

6

and you take the victim the way you find it,

7

which is the other problem with ION's

8

proposition here.

9

At times in their brief they seem to

10

say, if only my client had a different business

11

model, then maybe we could collect our lost

12

profit damages.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I -- I -- I hear

14

that, but -- but the -- to the extent we're

15

talking about the injury here and the poor

16

French Ambassador, I -- I get that we're -­

17

we're supposed to treat the manufacturer as if

18

it took place here, but how do we pretend that

19

the use on the high seas took place in Lake

20

Michigan?

21
22

That's where I'm struggling and I -- I
could still use your help.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

24

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

25

So -­
I -- the high seas

and Lake Michigan are -- are just not the same

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

to me.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, two things, Your

3

Honor:

One is, well, I think Congress made it

4

about as clear as it could in 271(f) that it

5

wanted you to treat the infringement on the

6

high seas as if it took place on Lake Michigan.

7

The second thing I would say, though,

8

is it just doesn't matter whether some action

9

by third parties that exacerbates damage is

10

independently lawful or unlawful.

11

I mean, if in hitting the French

12

Ambassador there is then an ambulance service

13

that takes the French Ambassador to the most

14

expensive hospital -­

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Help -- help -- help

16

me out with just the language of the statute.

17

You say it's obvious from the language of the

18

statute.

19

What -- what -- what would you point

20

me to?

21

show me that the -- the use on the high seas is

22

to be treated as if it took place in Lake

23

Michigan?

24
25

What's your best textual argument to

MR. CLEMENT:

Because the violator of

271(f) is liable for either contributory or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

inducing infringement, whether it's (f)(1) or

2

(f)(2), if they induce a combination that, if

3

the combination occurred in the United States,

4

would violate the patent laws here.

5

So, as the Court said in Limelight,

6

you effectively have a contributory

7

constructive infringement.

8

treat that foreign infringement, even though,

9

for reasons of comity, we're not making the

You're supposed to

10

foreign combination itself unlawful, we're

11

supposed to treat the domestic infringer just

12

like they induced a domestic act of

13

infringement.

14

Of course, it doesn't stop there.

I

15

mean, if you look at 281, which is the analog

16

of the cause of action issue at RJR, it says

17

for the infringement.

18

If you look at the 284, the provision

19

my friend wants you to look at and nothing

20

else, it says damages adequate to compensate

21

for the infringement.

22

There's no principle -­

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what about

24

-- what about proximate cause?

Wouldn't you

25

have to establish at least that the reason that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

-- that you have -- that the sales that you

2

lost to the foreign, whatever the people who

3

sweep the high seas, that you would have gotten

4

those contracts if they didn't?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

We have to

6

satisfy proximate cause.

It provides

7

sufficient protection here.

8

which I think 271(a) and 271(f) infringement is

9

different, because in the -- in the mine-run

It's one way in

10

case of 271(f) infringement, it's going to be

11

very easy to show damages that are reasonably

12

foreseeable from the foreign combination

13

because, in order to be liable at all, you have

14

to intend or induce that very foreign

15

combination.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACHARY D. TRIPP

22
23
24
25

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS
CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TRIPP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

I just have a few points I'd like to

2

make in follow-up to that.

3

asking the Court to reject the categorical rule

4

that a patentee can never be awarded damages

5

like these.

6

Of course, we're

The Patent Act provides for damages

7

that are adequate to compensate for the

8

infringement, not damages that leave the victim

9

worse off than it would have been if the

10
11

infringement had never occurred.
If I could turn to the comity point

12

and the international relations point that

13

there were questions about, we're here as the

14

United States and we are supporting Petitioner.

15

The rule that we're advocating of full

16

compensation is already the rule that applies

17

basically everywhere else in U.S. law, in tort,

18

in contract, in copyright, that this Court

19

previously assumed applied in patent law as

20

well, and it hasn't given rise to any

21

significant foreign relations problems in -- in

22

any of those areas.

23

that there's any reason to believe that it

24

would here.

25

And -- and we don't think

And I think one important piece of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

that and one of the ways this is different for

2

actually regulating the conduct on the high

3

seas is that, if -- if U.S. law was actually

4

regulating the third parties on the high seas,

5

you'd have a different set of defendants.

6

The customers who actually were -- did

7

-- did these surveys, they would be here right

8

now before -- before the Court, and they're

9

not.

10

The only -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then maybe this is an

12

easy case, but what's in the back of my mind, I

13

reverse the idea, see, France has this law that

14

you want here, right?

15

one day and he makes a tiny particle, which it

16

turns out violates somebody else's French

17

patent.

18

where it forms a very small part of a very

19

large and valuable gizmo.

20

we discover that he's paying the entire profit

21

of the entire gizmo industry to some French

22

company that had a small patent on a small

23

part.

24
25

Joe Smith goes to France

He ships it back to the United States,

And all of a sudden,

Now all I have to do is generalize
from that and I think, my God, we have a lot of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

problems here.

Now there should be some

2

principle in law that cuts that off so my

3

horrible example becomes just what you think it

4

is, a horrible example with no practical bite.

5

MR. TRIPP:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7
8
9

Yes -­
I'm looking for that

principle.
MR. TRIPP:
pieces to that.

So I think there's two

I think one is that (f) is, I

10

think, narrower than you're describing in your

11

hypothetical.

12

reaches conduct that is basically tantamount to

13

actually just making the thing in -- in the

14

United States and then exporting it.

15

reaches the supply of all or a substantial

16

portion of the components, or a component that

17

is especially designed and has no other

18

purpose, other -- other than for -- for use in

19

the invention.

20

it with intent.

21

It doesn't go that far.

It

This only

And, of course, you need to do

And then the other -- the other

22

principle that cuts off -- and I recognize the

23

-- the intuition that there may be situations

24

where it seems like the damages are running too

25

far afield from the wrongful conduct that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

happened in -- either in the United States or

2

in France, in the hypothetical.

3

saying is the right way to approach that

4

problem is with the doctrines of

5

causation-in-fact and proximate cause that are

6

tailor-made to answer those kinds of questions.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

All that we're

The D.C. Circuit did

8

that with Empagran follow-up in -- in a case

9

which you may not have read.

10

haven't read it; I'll stop.

11
12
13

Tell me if you

MR. TRIPP:
not.

I'm not sure if I have or

I'm not sure which case you're -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, they're -­

14

they're using proximate cause to try to deal

15

with this.

16

Does that ring a bell?

MR. TRIPP:

Forget it.

We -- so we think profit,

17

like as in an ordinary tort case in -- in the

18

French tourist hypothetical, in order for her

19

to prove -- obtain recovery of lost wages, she

20

needs to prove that the lost wages were the

21

proximate cause -- were proximately caused by

22

the underlying tort.

23

recover those wages does not depend on whether

24

she would have earned them in Florida or in

25

France because that is totally irrelevant to

But her ability to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

the question at the damages stage, which is how

2

big an award does the court need to give to the

3

victim to compensate her, to get her back into

4

the position that she would have been if that

5

tort had never occurred.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, you do -­

7

you do have to prove, don't you, that -- that

8

this company would have, in fact, made that

9

sale abroad?

What happens in a situation where

10

you need a license from a foreign government

11

and there's no evidence that you will

12

necessarily get that license?

13

MR. TRIPP:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15
16

Well, I think -­
Isn't that too

attenuated then?
MR. TRIPP:

It may well be, and I

17

think that gets to an important point, which

18

actually in -- in patent cases, it's quite

19

difficult to prove even causation-in-fact for

20

lost profits.

21

instructions in this case on -- even just on

22

causation-in-fact, they're in the JA from -­

If you look at the -- the

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

MR. TRIPP:

25

I have.

Yeah, I mean, this is -­

this is quite detailed, and so you have -- you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

have that.

2

cause overlay on top of it.

3

And then you have the proximate

I think the -- the other place that I

4

think is helpful to look at this is Professor

5

Yelderman's amicus brief, which does a nice job

6

of walking through the doctrine both of

7

causation-in-fact and proximate cause in the

8

federal circuit when dealing with problems that

9

are analogous to these.

10

These are a robust

check.

11

But more than anything, what we're

12

saying is that the right way to approach it is

13

with that -- through that lens and not through

14

this ham-handed rule that basically, as soon as

15

you get across the international border, the

16

causal chain is automatically severed, no

17

matter what, no matter how clear the causal

18

link is.

19

doesn't make any sense, and we're asking the

20

Court to reject it.

21

That rule, frankly, just -- just

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Tripp, may I ask

22

about your theory for getting to that result,

23

which is different from Mr. Clement's theories,

24

and there are quite a number of theories over

25

on that side of the table.

And some seem to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

emphasize 271(f) and how that came to be and

2

what its particular terms are.

3

emphasize that this is a damages provision that

4

we're talking about.

5

Some seem to

Why did you pick the one you picked

6

and why do you think it's better than the one

7

Mr. -- than the ones Mr. Clement picked, if you

8

still do?

9

MR. TRIPP:

Yeah, we absolutely do.

10

We're asking the rule -- affirmatively to adopt

11

this rule as a matter of Section 284, the

12

general damages provision that applies all

13

throughout the Patent Act.

14

basically everywhere in American law and should

15

apply basically everywhere in the Patent Act as

16

well, and not just in the rare cases that come

17

up under 271(f).

18

It applies

I think one piece of that is that

19

really the point of (f) is to treat the supply

20

of components for assembly abroad the same way

21

as just making it here and then exporting it.

22

But that's an (a) case, and we think the rule

23

of damages should be the same in both of them.

24
25

And then I think in terms of our -­
our theory, I think our -- our -- our principal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

submission is that when -- once you get to

2

compensatory damages, right, you have a

3

plaintiff that is standing in front of the

4

court and has already proven its case under

5

U.S. law.

6

by the defendant.

7

court is trying to do is to compensate the

8

victim, to get the victim back into the

9

position that it would have been in if that

10

It's proven that it's been wronged
Right?

And then all the

legal wrong had never occurred.

11

And we think the focus of that inquiry

12

of compensatory damages, that's always domestic

13

because the victim is just standing right there

14

in front of the U.S. court.

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So -- so just to

16

follow up on this, would you -- would you agree

17

that the -- that the other alternative creates

18

a potential incongruity?

19

to rely on 271(f), we might be in a situation

20

where we're permitting greater damages for

21

someone who only partially manufactured, only

22

partially completed the -- the patent

23

infringement in this country, as compared to

24

someone under (a), who did the entire act here.

25

MR. TRIPP:

Because, if we were

Yes, I -- I think that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

right, and I think actually the -- the sort of

2

the quintessential, the easiest case are these

3

(a) cases that was Goulds and as this Court

4

understood it in Dowagiac, which is that there

5

was a manufacturer here followed by a sale

6

abroad, right.

7

think, is the easiest example of this, we use

8

it in our brief, is the -- the Acme and Copycat

9

example.

10

A manufacturer for export, I

But, of course, it could also arise in

11

(f) cases, and -- and I agree with Petitioner

12

that it's particularly likely to arise in (f)

13

cases because every (f) case has this intent

14

element where you're intending that it will be

15

combined abroad.

16

cases but -- but not in all of them.

17

That happens in some (a)

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement has

18

another theory, which just says the presumption

19

against territory -- territoriality doesn't

20

apply at all to damages provisions.

21

Is there a real difference between

22

that and what you're saying?

I mean, can you

23

imagine a damages provision where you would

24

say, yes, the presumption against

25

territoriality applies and this is an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

extraterritorial application?

2

MR. TRIPP:

So I don't think there's a

3

significant difference between the two.

4

talking about compensatory damages here.

5

think all that we're saying -- I think you

6

could look at it either way.

7

basically get to the same place:

8

that it's inapplicable or apply it and just say

9

that it doesn't change the result.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We're
And I

You would
Either say

So it's not something

11

special about this damages provision; you're

12

saying as to any damages provision?

13

MR. TRIPP:

I -- I think our rule

14

would apply to any general compensatory damages

15

provision.

16

any situation where the focus of compensatory

17

damages would be doing anything other than

18

compensating the victim, and we think that is

19

always going to involve a domestic application

20

of the statute.

21

just say that it's inapplicable in that

22

context.

23

results, and we don't -- wouldn't have a

24

problem with that.

25

I have not been able to think of

You could come at that and

I think it basically gets the same

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what is the -­

2

what is the domestic injury?

3

MR. TRIPP:

The -- I mean, the

4

domestic legal wrong here is the infringement

5

for -­

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

MR. TRIPP:

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9
10

The legal wrong, yeah.

Yeah.
But this is what makes

this case difficult, because there's such a gap
between the legal injury, which is -­

11

MR. TRIPP:

Yeah.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- ephemeral, and the

13

practical injury, which occurs completely

14

abroad.

15

MR. TRIPP:

Yeah, so I think two

16

responses to that.

So, first, the patent is a

17

property right, and we often think of the

18

invasion of a property right as -- as being

19

something significant, even if it doesn't have

20

additional tangible harm.

21

fundamentally, it's quite common to hold a

22

tortfeasor responsible for the harm that it

23

causes when it sets into motion a series of

24

events by which the victim will be -- will be

25

hurt, even if they're not hurt at the time.

But also, more

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32

So, in -- in the French tourist

2

hypothetical that -- that we've been

3

discussing, imagine that what happened was that

4

she brings her car to the shop, the brakes are

5

broken, and the shop doesn't repair the brakes.

6

They tortiously don't do anything and send her

7

back out on the road with a car with no brakes.

8

Of course, she could recover for her

9

lost wages that were -- were caused by that

10

tort, and it would not matter -- if I could

11

just finish the answer to the question -- it -­

12

and it would not matter that the tort in a

13

sense didn't hurt her at the time.

14

motion her injury and would be liable for the

15

whole thing.

16
17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It set into

I -- I had one

question the Chief Justice agreed I could ask.

18

Suppose the Petitioner had a foreign

19

subsidiary in the Bahamas and it used that in

20

order to conduct a sweeping operation, so it

21

sells -- it sells the device to the -- to the

22

subsidiary, and the subsidiary then uses it.

23

What -- what result?

24
25

MR. TRIPP:

If the Petitioner under

the facts of the case was basically selling the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

item to itself?

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, as a foreign

subsidiary.

4

MR. TRIPP:

I think maybe in that case

5

it would have difficulty proving lost profits

6

because I'm not sure how big a profit it would

7

get in a sale made to itself.

8
9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then the facts

are the same; the subsidiary loses the job
because ION does it itself.

11

MR. TRIPP:

I -- I think so long as

12

they could prove causation in fact and

13

proximate cause, that -- that if there's

14

infringement here, they're on the hook for the

15

whole thing.

Thank you,

Mr. Shanmugam.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21
22
23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The presumption against

24

extraterritoriality applies with particular

25

force to the Patent Act.

And as the government

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

recognized at least in its brief, the

2

presumption applies independently to remedial

3

provisions as well as substantive ones because

4

remedial provisions can create a similar risk

5

of conflict with foreign law.

6

Now, in our view, this case involves

7

the extraterritorial application of the

8

remedial provision in the Patent Act, Section

9

284, which by its terms has no extraterritorial

10

reach.

11

all of the parties now agree, was concededly

12

domestic, our submission is that the damages

13

here were, in fact, foreign.

14

Petitioner repeatedly describes those damages

15

as foreign.

16

And while the act of infringement here,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And, indeed,

Well, suppose there

17

were a different business model and what the

18

Petitioner did was to sell the device to

19

others, rather than to conduct the operation

20

itself.

21

foreign company, and then ION sells the same

22

device and takes the sale away.

23

And it's about ready to sell to X, a

Would the Petitioner be entitled to

24

the lost profits from that sale?

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

The answer would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

be different in that circumstance because the

2

situs of the injury in that circumstance would

3

be the United States, at least absent any

4

additional facts, because I think you could add

5

facts to alter the analysis.

6

In our view, that hypothetical,

7

Justice Kennedy, is basically the fact pattern

8

of Goulds.

9

law for determining the situs of the sale of a

And there is an established body of

10

product and where you are exporting a product

11

from the United States to a foreign country, at

12

least arguably the situs of the sale is the

13

United States.

14

But this case -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

of the contract here?

16

conduct the sweep.

17

But isn't the situs

You have the contract to

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So there is

18

importantly no evidence in the record to that

19

effect.

20

41A of the Petition Appendix, the federal

21

circuit says that there is no contention that

22

the service contracts were entered into in the

23

United States.

In fact, if you take a look at page

24

The only thing that you have

25

domestically here -- and we all agree that this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

is true -- is the initial act of infringement.

2

And, indeed, there is an immediate factual

3

injury that takes place at the point of

4

infringement.

5

The patentee at that point could

6

potentially lose sales of a component if the

7

patentee, in fact, sold a competing version of

8

the component.

9

here.

10

That is not the fact pattern

And there is also the loss of

11

royalties at that point.

12

reasonable royalty remedy comes in to

13

compensate that immediate factual injury.

14

And that's where the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm -- I'm sorry,

15

I didn't think damages were awarded for a

16

hypothetical.

17

lose.

They're awarded for what you

18

And since this company didn't sell its

19

products, it only used them, why should it only

20

get the value of a royalty, since that's not

21

its business?

22

products, to sell its services, your point,

23

abroad or anywhere in the world where it could.

24

And it wasn't going to ship the part.

25

wasn't going to permit someone to get a

Its business was to sell

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It

Official
37
1
2

royalty, to pay a royalty.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Sotomayor,

3

Petitioner, in fact, did get a reasonable

4

royalty, to the tune of $22 million, which

5

compensates for the act of infringement; that

6

is to say, the initial factual injury from

7

supplying the infringing component from the

8

United States.

9

And that is hypothetical only in the

10

sense that the way a reasonable royalty is

11

calculated, because, obviously, there was no

12

license and no actual royalty, looks at a

13

hypothetical negotiation.

14

negotiation that the patentee and the infringer

15

would have conducted for a license for what

16

turns out to be the act of infringement.

17

It looks at the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, if the jury

18

wasn't permitted to find lost profits, because

19

then the royalty might be something different.

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, in fact, in this

21

case, the jury awarded both.

They awarded lost

22

profits on top of the reasonable royalty,

23

which, as my friend recognizes, is the

24

traditional default remedy to provide for full

25

compensation.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

But I do want to address very briefly

2

Petitioner's suggestion in the reply brief and

3

at oral argument that somehow the recognition

4

that the calculation of the royalty could take

5

into account expected foreign use is somehow

6

contrary to our fundamental submission

7

concerning the lost profits damages here.

8

I would refer the Court to Judge

9

Taranto's very thoughtful opinion in the

10

Carnegie Mellon case on this point, that's the

11

opinion that we cite on the page of the brief

12

that Mr. Clement cited, but I think that, in

13

calculating the reasonable royalty, you

14

naturally look to the commercial value of the

15

component that's being supplied from the United

16

States.

17

And engaging in that but-for analysis,

18

of course, one of the things that makes the

19

component lucrative is the fact that ION's

20

customers would value it for its subsequent

21

use.

22

actual foreign use.

23

the expected foreign use as a way of

24

determining the commercial value of the

25

component.

But there you're not taking into account
You're taking into account

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but it seems

2

to me that you're confining the right of the

3

Petitioner to decide how it's going to use its

4

own patent.

5

decide how it's going to capitalize on its

6

patent?

7

Isn't it up to the Patent Owner to

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The right that is

8

conferred by Section 271(f), Justice Kennedy,

9

is a limited right.

We agree with Petitioner

10

and the government that 271(f) was enacted to

11

fill a gap to essentially overrule this Court's

12

holding in Deepsouth, but Congress in doing

13

that acted in a restrained and limited fashion,

14

consistent with the traditional territorial

15

scope of the patent laws.

16

As this Court recognized in its

17

opinion in Microsoft, Congress acted narrowly

18

to regulate only the act of supply from the

19

United States.

20

if Congress had acted more broadly, if Congress

21

had prohibited the foreign combination, or if

22

Congress had amended Section 284 to make

23

broader damages available.

24
25

This might be a different case

But it's important, I think, to keep
in mind that Deepsouth itself didn't involve

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

this type of damages.

at the Court's opinion in Deepsouth, it is

clear that Laitram, the patent holder in that

case, was seeking an injunction and it was also

seeking lost profits from the lost sales of

deveining equipment.

JUSTICE ALITO:

prohibited the foreign combination, wouldn't

that be the end of the case?

Would you still

10

argue that you'd have to analyze whether the

11

damages provision applies extraterritorially?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think you

13

would, Justice Alito, for the reasons given in

14

your opinion for the Court in RJR Nabisco.

other words, the analysis doesn't end simply

16

because the underlying substantive provision

17

has extraterritorial reach.

on and conduct an independent analysis of the

remedial provision.

In

You do have to go

Now I think there would be a question

21

about whether the remedial provision, say,

22

sufficiently incorporates the substantive

23

provision, such that the remedial provision

24

should be read to reach extraterritorially as

25

well.

That was the debate between the majority

Heritage Reporting Corporation

and the dissent in RJR Nabisco.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, there -- there

3

are differences between this case and RJR

4

Nabisco, which I won't go into, but if -- if

5

you have a liability provision that says there

6

is liability for acts that are committed

7

abroad, what sense does it make to say, well,

8

although Congress thinks there should be

9

liability for these acts committed abroad, we

10

have to analyze the -- the remedial provisions

11

separately to see whether they wanted any

12

remedy for these acts that are committed

13

abroad.

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I do think, Justice

15

Alito, that that was an aspect of the scheme at

16

issue in RICO insofar as, in the first part of

17

the Court's opinion, the Court essentially

18

construed Section 1962 to reach

19

extraterritorially because certain predicate

20

acts reached extraterritorially.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why does that make any

sense whatsoever?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that

5

that actually illustrates why this is an easier

6

case than RJR Nabisco, because what really

7

doesn't make any sense is to conclude that

8

Congress, in regulating only domestic

9

substantive conduct, intended to make foreign

10

damages available as well.

11

And, again, in Deepsouth, this sort of

12

lost profits damages for downstream foreign use

13

was certainly not at issue.

14

seeking to obtain lost profits for the use of

15

deveining equipment.

16

Laitram was not

At most, they were seeking lost

leave, let me say just one thing about RJR

19

Nabisco, having been told to forget it.

20

want to address just one aspect of it, which is

21

the effort to distinguish it by Petitioner in

22

its reply brief.

23

But, with your

I do

I think Petitioner attempts to draw a

24

distinction between a provision that merely

25

creates a private right of action on the one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1
2

hand and a damages provision on the other.
But, as you will recall in the latter

3

part of the Court's opinion, the Court

4

addressed Section 1964(c).

5

creates the private right of action and

6

provides for treble damages.

7

Court's discussion of the risk to comity from

8

that provision, the Court discussed not only

9

the fact that you'd be creating a private right

10

of action in contexts where foreign governments

11

might not do likewise but also cited the risk

12

of treble damages.

13

That provision both

And in the

And although there were no amicus

14

briefs in that case and, indeed, the European

15

Community was a plaintiff in that case, the

16

Court looked back to Empagran and the amicus

17

briefs that were filed in Empagran as support

18

for the proposition that damages provisions, no

19

less than substantive provisions, can give rise

20

to comity concerns.

What this Court -­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

What are they?
Well -­
I mean, that's -­

24

that's where I'm -- I'm having trouble to be -­

25

actually, to be specific.

I can imagine a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

problem if a large British or French or Swiss

2

company, which makes items sold all over the

3

world, farms out through a -- through a branch

4

in North Carolina and makes a tiny part which

5

it turns out infringes someone else's American

6

patent.

7

And, as a result for that -- of that,

8

that French or British or Spanish company must

9

pay to that North Carolina firm its profits

10

from billions of dollars of sales across the

11

world.

12

Now that's not just hypothetical

13

because an amicus brief cites to us the Marvel

14

case where that really happened.

15

see how that would, in fact, upset foreign

16

countries a lot, because, after all, it wasn't

17

even a violation of any foreign patent law.

18

And I can imagine them having similar statutes

19

which then cause more problems.

20

Okay?

And that's all in your favor.

I can

Yeah.

21

But there is a principle of law that should

22

deal with that and it's called proximate cause.

23

And that's why I brought up the Empagran case

24

below.

25

did not seem very willing to embrace it.

They didn't seem -- your opponents here

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

problem is one of proximate cause and knowing

7

I mean, the

And take comity into

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Don't

I thought that would be

So I have several

8

responses to the various aspects of your

9

question, so let me attempt at least four of

10
11

them if I can get them out.
The first is that while there is a

12

substantial cleavage between Petitioner and the

13

government, I think that if you look at

14

Petitioner's reply brief in particular, it is

15

clear that Petitioner, like the government,

16

thinks that the same rule should apply to

17

Section 271(f) as to Section 271(a).

18

And, indeed, if you look at the first

19

10 pages of the reply brief in this argument,

20

an excursus about legal injury, the implication

21

would be the same in the 271(a) context.

22

to the extent that you cite perhaps a simpler

23

hypothetical in the 271(a) context, the rule, I

24

think, would have to be the same, and that's

25

why this case is so important.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So,

Official
46
1

I think, second, your hypothetical

2

earlier was exactly on point.

At page 49 of

3

our brief, we give the example of computer

4

software.

5

the Alice case, there are very real limitations

6

under American law on the patentability of

7

computer software, but other countries, such as

8

Japan, have a different rule.

9

have the very same comity concern that you laid

And as this Court will be aware from

And so you could

10

out 20 minutes ago, where you have a foreign

11

country that, say, because an American company

12

engages in testing in that country, seeks to

13

impose liability for the downstream production

14

of the same product or downstream foreign uses.

15

And -­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the liability

17

is -- is imposed on a U.S. entity.

There's

18

nothing in this picture that regulates anything

19

that occurs abroad.

20

damages that flow from domestic conduct and not

21

regulation of conduct elsewhere.

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The question is the

I mean, to be fair,

23

Justice Ginsburg, I think that what Petitioner

24

is trying to do in this case is effectively to

25

hold us secondarily liable for what would be or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

what might not be an act of foreign direct

2

infringement.

3

But I think that the concern that this

4

case presents is exactly the concern that Your

5

Honor stated in the opinion for the Court in

6

the Microsoft case; namely, in the Court's own

7

words, converting a single act of supply from

8

the United States into a springboard for what

9

would effectively be worldwide damages.

And

10

the Court was citing the brief filed by my

11

learned friend Mr. -- Mr. Clement on behalf of

12

the United States when it said that.

13

exactly what is going on here.

14

That is

And the last point I wanted to make in

15

response to your point, Justice Breyer, is the

16

one thing that we haven't heard anything about

17

in any of Petitioner's filings or at oral

18

argument is the fact that Petitioner and its

19

many, many corporate affiliates hold patents in

20

numerous countries around the world.

21

is the remedy in this circumstance, where what

22

you're talking about is a downstream foreign

23

use or downstream foreign infringement.

24
25

And that

And, yes, this case arises in the
context of the high seas, but as we point out

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

and as the amicus brief on behalf of the

2

technology industry points out as well, even in

3

the high seas context, you do have a remedy.

4

You can go to the countries where the ships are

5

flagged and prosecute your patents.

6

And as we point out in our brief,

7

Petitioner and its affiliates have patents in

8

all these countries.

9

countries could reach different judgments.

Now I will say that those
In

10

fact -- and this is not in the briefs, but I

11

think this is established on the facts of this

12

case -- Petitioner's corporate affiliates

13

sought patents elsewhere; they sought patents

14

from the European Community.

15

abandoned the patent that is the equivalent to

16

the primary patent at issue in this case, the

17

'520 patent.

18

And they actually

And I just think that that reflects

19

the fact that there could be different

20

judgments in different countries.

21

Petitioner is really trying to do in this case

22

is precisely what this Court ought to be

23

concerned about.

to full compensation for its injury?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That's

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Which is the full

12

compensation for its injury.

13

position is that this Petitioner is not

14

entitled to full compensation for his injury,

15

yes or no?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Your whole

Yes, as a consequence

17

of the application of the presumption against

18

extraterritoriality.

19

that this Court established in RJR Nabisco that

20

provisions that afford relief are no different

21

from substantive provisions, jurisdictional

22

provisions, the other types of provisions to

23

which this Court has applied the presumption.

24
25

And I really do think

Now I will say, Justice Kennedy, that
our submission here is a modest one.

I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

you can have reassurance that a rule in our

2

favor in this case is not going to create

3

problems for other statutes, and it may leave

4

the door open for damages of the sort we were

5

discussing earlier, damages of the type that

6

were at issue in the Goulds case, where you

7

have, for instance, the shipment of a product

8

from the United States abroad.

9

Our test is quite simple.

In

10

determining whether damages are foreign or

11

domestic, you should look to the situs of the

12

factual injury and you should also look to

13

whether there is subsequent substantial foreign

14

conduct after the act of infringement that

15

gives rise to the injury.

16

And this case is a very

17

straightforward case on the facts to apply that

18

principle because everything relevant after the

19

initial act of infringement took place abroad.

20

What Petitioner is trying to obtain here is

21

lost profits damages for losing out on

22

contracts to perform entirely foreign surveys.

23

And that's because -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't that exactly

how the copyright law is applied under the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

so-called predicate act doctrine?

2

copyright owner can get damages flowing from

3

the exploitation abroad of domestic acts of

4

infringement.

5

patent field of the same doctrine?

6
7

The

Isn't this an application to the

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes and no, Justice

Ginsburg.

8

In the copyright context, the reason

9

why you can obtain profits for things that take

10

place abroad is because the copyright law makes

11

infringers' profits available.

12

And as Judge Hand explained in the

13

original opinion on this issue, infringers'

14

profits are -- are an equitable remedy.

15

are a form of disgorgement.

16

the legal fiction that you impose a

17

constructive trust on infringing articles so

18

that whatever happens to those articles, you

19

have a constructive trust on the profits as

20

well.

21

They

And they rely on

In 1946, Congress amended the

22

predecessor to Section 284 to eliminate that

23

form of profit, to eliminate infringers'

24

profits.

25

And what you can't get even under the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

are at issue here, the lost profits of the

2

copyright holder.

3

to Judge O'Scannlain's opinion for the Ninth

4

Circuit in the Los Angeles News Service case,

5

which draws this distinction and makes that

6

distinction clear.

And I would refer this Court

7

Again, we come back to the sort of

8

fundamental proposition that this Court has

9

taught in RJR Nabisco that you have to apply

10

the presumption to remedial provisions.

11

is no indication on the face of Section 284

12

that in -- that it provides for

13

extraterritorial damages.

14

Justice Kennedy pointed out, is that you're

15

allowed to obtain damages adequate to

16

compensate for the infringement.

17

There

All it provides, as

That language, while broad on its

18

terms, does not overcome the presumption

19

against extraterritoriality.

20

have to proceed to the second step.

21

again, as this Court laid out in RJR Nabisco,

22

at the second step, what you do is you look at

23

the focus of the relevant provision.

24

of Section 284 is damages.

25

whether the damages are foreign or domestic.

And so then you
And,

The focus

And you determine

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

No different from what the Court did

2

at the second step in RJR Nabisco, which was to

3

determine whether the factual injury, because

4

that statute was worded in terms of injury, is

5

foreign or domestic.

6

And -- and in -- again, in this case,

7

it is very easy to conceive of why the damages

8

are foreign, because there really are two

9

distinct factual injuries here.

10

And since we're talking about car

11

crashes this morning, let me give you an

12

example.

13

the Court this morning, I was driving over the

14

Roosevelt Bridge, and I crashed into somebody

15

on a motorcycle, and that individual was

16

concussed, the individual then got off the

17

motorcycle and wandered down the bridge,

18

perhaps across the Potomac and across the state

19

line into the District of Columbia, and then

20

got hit by another car, you would say that that

21

person had two injuries:

22

immediate injury, the concussion, and then had

23

the downstream injury, having, say, their foot

24

run over by another driver.

25

If, for instance, I was driving to

The person had the

And, here, our argument is that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

downstream injury is entirely foreign.

2

again, critically, it relies on the intervening

3

conduct of third parties that would constitute

4

an act of direct infringement.

5

And,

Suppose that the ships in question

6

were all Norwegian ships, at least one of them

7

was a Norway-flagged ship.

8

Norway had coterminous patent laws to the

9

United States.

And assume that

In this case, Norway would have

10

the ability to impose liability for direct

11

infringement on our customers, the ones who

12

engaged in not just the combination but the

13

downstream use, and Norway would be able to go

14

after us under its equivalents to Section

15

271(b) and 271(c) as a -­

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'll think about

17

your hypo, but it seems to me it's as if you

18

got back in the car and then hit him again when

19

he went in Virginia.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23
24
25

Well, critically -­
That -- that -- that

would be more like what happened in this case.
MR. SHANMUGAM:
further, Justice Kennedy.

We did nothing
Keep in mind that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

Section 271(f) regulates only the act of

2

supply.

3

requirement under Section 271(f) that the

4

combination actually occur.

5

And, indeed, there is no further

I heard my friend, Mr. Clement,

6

suggest at one point in his argument that

7

Section 271(f) has as an element some

8

additional act of inducement.

9

whether the parties induced a combination

10

He referred to

abroad.

11

All that the relevant provision here

12

in 271(f)(2) does is to regulate the supply

13

with an intent that a combination occur.

14

Indeed, in this case, as to a percentage of the

15

DigiFINs at issue, there was no ultimate

16

subsequent combination.

17

And so, again, all that we're saying

18

-- and I think that this is a submission that

19

flows directly from the language of Section

20

271(f) -- is all Congress did was to regulate

21

the domestic act of supply, consistent with the

22

traditionally territorial nature of the patent

23

laws.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. SHANMUGAM:

-- for the initial act

of supply.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Shanmugam, what

4

struck me about your hypo is that it's a

5

classic law school proximate cause hypo.

6

mean, that's what that hypo is.

7

suggests that if there's a problem here, it's a

8

problem about where you draw the causal line.

9

It's not a problem about some categorical

10
11
12
13

I

And it

extraterritoriality rule.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

So I do want to

address that, Justice Kagan.
I think that, in my hypothetical, I'm

14

willing to concede that for purposes of

15

proximate causation and going back to Palsgraf

16

and all of those wonderful cases, that I could

17

be held liable for both of those injuries.

18

And, to be sure, this analysis is not

19

entirely disconnected from causation because,

20

as I indicated earlier, the fact that there is

21

subsequent foreign conduct matters to the test.

22

What makes this case different from

23

the earlier French ambassador hypothetical is

24

that the injury is immediate.

25

be that you need to have further treatment, but

It may very well

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

there is not subsequent conduct.

2

I will say -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

could -- well, go ahead.

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

You could -- you

I do want to address

6

any suggestion that causation is somehow the

7

solution here by making a couple of points.

8
9

The first is that, with regard to
proximate causation, the federal circuit has

10

adopted a quite expansive test which requires

11

only mere foreseeability, I would refer the

12

Court to an en banc opinion called Rite-Hite,

13

which sets out that test.

14

proximate causation argument in this case.

15

Professor Yelderman in his amicus

There is no

16

brief suggests that this is an easy case for

17

proximate causation.

18

proximate causation, at least under the

19

existing state of the law, unless this Court

20

wants to address that down the road, is going

21

to provide much solace to companies like my

22

client.

23

So I don't know that

We do have an argument that Justice

24

Sotomayor adverted to, that there is not

25

sufficient but-for causation here.

That is an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

issue that remains to be resolved on remand.

2

And in the event that this Court were to

3

reverse, it certainly should remand to the

4

federal circuit so that it can address that

5

issue.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

However, it doesn't

7

quite answer it, because the -- your client, I

8

don't want to prejudice your client, but it

9

didn't seem to me he was the strongest case for

10

your argument.

11

pretty closely related, I think, but there -- I

12

can easily imagine cases where it's not.

13

I mean, the damages here are

And so it's come -- the proximate

14

cause -- yes, it's true, if you have a tough

15

proximate cause law, tough, you will stop

16

people from being fully compensated, but the

17

reason you do it is because you're afraid with

18

92 district courts and juries and so forth

19

it'll get out of control and be a kind of major

20

problem with other countries.

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that is -­
The argument the

23

other way -- and that's argument for you, say:

24

Just cut it off.

25

there are cases that will deserve it, deserve

MR. SHANMUGAM:

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Anything you want to

say about that?

5
6

I -­

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I would like to say

two things about that, Justice Breyer.

7

I mean, the first is that this Court

8

has crossed that bridge.

And I would cite this

9

Court's opinion in Empagran for the

10

proposition, the modest proposition that these

11

sorts of damages awards can create comity

12

concerns.

13

And, yes, we're not necessarily

14

dealing with treble damages, though, of course,

15

enhanced damages are available in patent cases

16

and were, in fact, awarded here.

17

are dealing with is the very real risk that

18

American juries in patent cases award much

19

bigger damages awards than courts do in other

20

countries.

21

But what we

And so, even leaving aside the fact

22

that other countries could have totally

23

different substantive patent laws, the risk of

24

runaway jury awards here certainly does present

25

substantial comity concerns.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

And I think that that is really, you

2

know, fundamentally the reason why the

3

presumption should apply.

4

problem that the other side has, which was

5

illustrated by Justice Gorsuch's question, is

6

that it can't point to anything that overcomes

7

the presumption.

8
9

And I think that the

Sure, Congress was thinking about the
possibility of eventual foreign combinations

10

when it enacted Section 271(f), but what it

11

didn't do was to attempt to regulate abroad.

12

And this Court in Morrison and RJR has

13

made clear that it is not sufficient to

14

overcome the presumption simply that Congress

15

might have contemplated the possibility of

16

downstream foreign activity.

17

give a clear and unmistakable indication of its

18

desire to have extraterritorial reach.

19

Congress has to

It doesn't have to necessarily do so

20

in the language of the statute, though this

21

Court made clear in RJR Nabisco that it would

22

be a rare case where the presumption is

23

overcome in the absence of explicit statutory

24

language.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, did you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

say earlier that if this sensor was

2

manufactured and sold from the United States to

3

someone abroad, you -- the infringer, would be

4

liable for that sale, correct?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So the -- yes.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So, if

7

the infringer knows that the only way that this

8

product is going to be sold is tied to

9

services, why isn't -- they -- why aren't they

10

responsible for that deprivation of the use of

11

the product?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Because the damages

13

are foreign.

14

of liability that you have to have this

15

foreign-oriented intent.

16

you have to have an intent that the combination

17

ultimately occur.

18
19
20

And to be sure, it is an element

Under Section 271(f),

And we're obviously not disputing
before this Court -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the -- the

21

statute by its own is -- is addressing a

22

combination, an intent to have the infringement

23

completed abroad.

24

extraterritoriality -- with extraterritoriality

25

in that situation.

So we know it applies

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

No.

I mean, I think

2

that everyone agrees, and I think it's a better

3

reading of this Court's opinion in Microsoft,

4

that Section 271(f) by its terms regulates only

5

domestic conduct.

The Court -­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

-- did invoke the

8

presumption, but it invoked the presumption to

9

reject a reading that would have given Section

10

271(f) effectively extraterritorial effect.

11

But, again, just to be clear, I don't

12

think that Petitioner's argument ultimately

13

depends on Section 271(f).

14

Petitioner's bottom line is that not only are

15

the federal circuit's decision in this case,

16

but also its earlier decisions in cases such as

17

Power Integrations and Carnegie Mellon, a case

18

where a jury awarded $1.17 billion in a

19

reasonable royalty for foreign sales, those

20

decisions would also have to come out the other

21

way.

22

I think that

To the extent that Petitioner is

23

relying on Section 271(f), that's really window

24

dressing on its argument because, at bottom,

25

the rule would be the same under Petitioner's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

interpretation in the 271(f) or the 271(a)

2

context.

3

And, critically, we all agree that

4

271(f) was designed to overturn this Court's

5

decision in Deepsouth, but the way that

6

Congress did that was to regulate a form of

7

domestic conduct, a form of domestic conducts

8

-- domestic conduct that as a result of this

9

Court's decision in Deepsouth did not in and of

10

itself constitute infringement.

11

Congress was certainly not thinking

12

about making available this sort of downstream

13

damages.

14

really sort of driving your question with

15

respect, Justice Sotomayor, the answer to all

16

of this is that Petitioner can go to foreign

17

courts and obtain damages if Petitioner has

18

foreign patent rights and if the law of those

19

respective jurisdictions permits it.

20

And to get back to what I think was

And there is a mechanism in place, the

21

WIPO process, that streamlines and makes it

22

easier for companies in Petitioner's position

23

to obtain those patents and to enforce them

24

abroad.

25

We'd ask that the judgment be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7
8
9
10
11

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I'd just like to clarify two details
and make a couple of points.
One detail, my friend mistakenly

12

referred to this case being brought in the

13

Eastern District of Texas.

14

brought in the Southern District of Texas,

15

where both of these companies are located.

16

It was, in fact,

It may be a pedantic point, but the

17

Eastern District of Texas has a certain

18

implication to it that I wanted to clarify.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. CLEMENT:

The second point is that

21

-- just to be crystal-clear, and my friend

22

concedes this in Footnote 3 of the red brief,

23

but there were not royalties and lost profits

24

on the -- the same components.

25

profits damages for those particular

The -- the lost

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

components, we got only lost profit damages,

2

and the reasonable royalties are only

3

calculated on other units.

4

And I think the concession that you

5

can take into account the expected foreign use

6

for calculating the royalty really gives the

7

game away, because calculating reasonable

8

royalties is just another counterfactual

9

exercise, determine -- that -- the whole point

10

of which is to determine what would my client's

11

position be in the absence of the infringement

12

in the United States.

13

treat those two situations differently.

14

And there's no reason to

I'm, of course, happy to win this case

15

on any of the three theories we present in our

16

brief or on the government's theory.

17

say, though, that Justice Alito's question is

18

the reason that I do think the better way to

19

resolve this case is to say cleanly, once and

20

for all, the presumption does not apply to

21

damages provisions, because if you walked my

22

friend's theory through and applied the

23

extraterritoriality principles woodenly to a

24

generic damages provision that complimented an

25

expressly extraterritorial liability provision,

I would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

it would -- you'd end up saying:

2

a foreign application and I guess I can't give

3

damages, even though Congress made this

4

expressly extraterritorial.

5

Well, this is

And that's not a trivial concern.

I

6

mean, Congress acted to overturn this Court's

7

decision in EEOC versus Aramco and applied

8

Title VII abroad.

9

-- with a generic damages provision.

10

And it supplements it with a

It would be really weird if you

11

couldn't get damages for that expressly

12

extraterritorial application.

13

would be just as weird, with all due respect,

14

to say that you couldn't get compensatory

15

damages for the full amount of the loss in a

16

271(f) case because the foreign combination

17

occurred abroad.

18

And I think it

Congress understood what it was doing.

19

It was imposing liability on a domestic actor

20

for combinations that intentionally took place

21

abroad.

22

solution to a lot of the problems, but

23

proximate cause isn't going to be a lot of help

24

to defendants in 271(f) cases because, if you

25

have to intend or induce the foreign

And I do think proximate cause is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

combination, I would say it's reasonably

2

foreseeable.

So we think you should reverse the
decision below.
