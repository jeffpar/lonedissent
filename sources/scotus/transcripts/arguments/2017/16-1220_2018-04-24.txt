ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. GOTTLIEB

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. GOTTLIEB:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether a

12

district court is bound to accept a foreign

13

sovereign's statement of foreign law in the

14

unusual case in which the court has concerns

15

about the statement's clarity, its

16

completeness, or its consistency.

17

The answer to that question is no.

18

District courts have the authority to resolve

19

their concerns by considering any relevant

20

materials, even if they go beyond the materials

21

presented by the sovereign.

22

On the motion to dismiss in this case,

23

the district court found that the amicus brief

24

that was submitted by the Chinese Ministry of

25

Commerce failed to answer important questions

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

about how its Vitamin C regulations applied to

2

the specific agreements that were identified in

3

the complaint.

4

Ministry's interpretation appeared to be at

5

odds with the regulations that it cited and the

6

documentary evidence before the court.

7

It also found that the

The Second Circuit held that the

8

district court abused its discretion by failing

9

to dismiss the case at the motion to dismiss

10

stage.

11

on its view that the Ministry's appearance

12

deprived the district court of discretion to

13

answer its questions about the Ministry -­

14

Ministry's position by proceeding to discovery.

15

And the panel's view was based entirely

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you a

16

question about your bottom line?

17

say that the court of appeals should be

18

reversed, but if you're right, that the court

19

of appeals should not have taken what the

20

Chinese Ministry said as conclusive, then

21

wouldn't the proper bottom line be a vacate and

22

remand so the Second Circuit can reassess, with

23

the understanding that what the Ministry said

24

is not conclusive?

25

MR. GOTTLIEB:

You -- you

We do think that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

vacating and remanding would be an appropriate

2

disposition.

3

our brief, the Second Circuit in Footnote 10 of

4

its opinion describe -- described what the -­

5

what the district court had done as completely

6

and reasonably appropriate in its treatment of

7

the evidence at the motion to dismiss stage and

8

on summary judgment stage.

9

However, as we've pointed out in

The -- the Second Circuit's opinion

10

was simply that the district court had -- that

11

the -- that the district court had erred and

12

abused its discretion in failing to allow the

13

case to move forward to discovery.

14

The district court -- or the court of

15

appeals hadn't even ruled on, for example, the

16

appropriate complaint.

17

construed the second amendment -- amended

18

complaint as opposed to the third amended

19

complaint, which was before the district court

20

on its motion for summary judgment.

21

The court of appeals

The -- the court of appeals did not

22

challenge in any way the district court's

23

construction and interpretation of Chinese law

24

that occurred in its summary judgment opinion.

25

And for that reason, we think that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

under the -- taking just the terms of Footnote

2

10 of the court of appeals' opinion, the proper

3

disposition would be to reverse.

4

certainly accept that vacating and remanding

5

would be an appropriate disposition as well.

6

We think that there are significant

But we

7

costs to the rule that the -- the Second

8

Circuit -- to the rule that the Second Circuit

9

has adopted.

10

One of those costs is the independence

11

of the judiciary to decide questions that are

12

before them.

13

their responsibility to say what the law is in

14

cases and controversies before them, even when

15

that law is foreign.

16

country have been interpreting and construing

17

foreign law for two centuries and not

18

outsourcing that task to other entities simply

19

because those questions are difficult.

20
21

U.S. courts should not give up

And courts in this

The integrity of the judicial process
relies upon courts -­

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But, counsel, we

23

actually do outsource saying what the law is

24

sometimes in domestic law; Chevron, for

25

example.

We give conclusive weight to a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

determination by an agency as to what the law

2

is.

3

So why, as a matter of comity,

4

wouldn't we do the same to an administrative

5

agency of a foreign sovereign?

6

MR. GOTTLIEB:

There's a number of

7

reasons, the -- the first of which is that the

8

Chevron doctrine has a number of sort of

9

gatekeeping steps or preconditions before this

10

Court would even consider the reasonableness of

11

an agency's interpretation.

12
13
14

And so, for example, Chevron step zero
and step one -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

All that -- all that

15

suggests is perhaps we -- we should import a

16

similar regime here.

17

MR. GOTTLIEB:

That would be quite a

18

holding of this Court, Justice Gorsuch.

19

would require this Court to invent rules for

20

how a court is to determine, for example, what

21

arm of a foreign sovereign is authoritative and

22

how that foreign sovereign arm exercises its

23

authority.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It

Suppose -- suppose a

court said that a decision of the Supreme Court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

of England must be followed -- must be accepted

2

as the law of England.

3

MR. GOTTLIEB:

In that circumstance,

4

Justice Kennedy, you would have, essentially,

5

law that was before the interpreting court.

6

other words, you would have the opinion of the

7

highest court, which -­

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In

Well, and as Justice

-- Justice Gorsuch's question indicates, we

10

always accept the law of the state supreme

11

court as being the law of the state.

12

MR. GOTTLIEB:

Justice Kennedy, this

13

Court does not always accept that law.

14

Generally, it defers to the -- the

15

interpretation of the highest state court, but

16

there are exceptions to that; for example -­

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it doesn't take

18

their view of what the attorney general of the

19

state says is the law.

20

MR. GOTTLIEB:

21

That's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. GOTTLIEB:

That's -­

The -- the highest

24

ranking law enforcement officer of a state

25

would not receive binding or conclusive

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

deference on its interpretation of -- of its

2

state law.

3

But, importantly, Justice Kennedy,

4

with respect to the question of a foreign

5

court, even if presented with an opinion of a

6

foreign nation's highest court, the task for

7

the United States court would still remain to

8

determine is that -- is that opinion or is that

9

precedent binding on the question that is

10

before me.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine, fine.

What's

12

the difference between what various professors

13

have suggested I might have written in places

14

that we should give respectful deference to the

15

-- the opinions about the foreign nation,

16

highest court or appropriate, respectful

17

deference and what the court here said?

18

defer to the Ministry's reasonable

19

interpretation that the term means or suggests.

20

We

I mean, maybe there's a difference

21

between "defer to a reasonable interpretation"

22

and "give respectful deference to."

23

is it?

24
25

MR. GOTTLIEB:

But what

The first formulation

of that standard that you described, Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

Breyer, is the substantial deference standard,

2

which is what the district court applied in

3

this case.

4

inappropriate about that and it is what most

5

courts in this country -­

6

And we think there is nothing

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what you want us

7

to do is to say you used the term "defer to a

8

reasonable interpretation" and you should have

9

used the term "we give respectful deference

10

to."

11

reconsider the whole thing.

12

And for that reason, we would like you to

Now I -- I -- I see that.

It

13

certainly has a point.

14

would sort of start to smile on the court of

15

appeals when we wrote such an opinion.

16

But I'm afraid people

MR. GOTTLIEB:

Justice Breyer, if that

17

were our position, I would expect people to

18

smile, but that is not our position.

19
20
21

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

Well, what is

it?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

Our position is that

22

the standard that the court of appeals applied

23

was not a defer -- if the substance of the

24

opinion is reasonable standard.

25

that the court of appeals applied -- applied

The standard

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

was a -- a court that receives a sovereign

2

interpretation is bound to defer if it is -- if

3

the opinion is reasonable under the

4

circumstances.

5

And we know that the way that the

6

court of appeals applied that standard was by

7

only looking to the district court's decision

8

on a motion to dismiss, in which the district

9

court did not construe Chinese law.

10

The district court did not construe or

11

interpret Chinese law on the motion to dismiss.

12

It simply held that the record before it, as it

13

stood at that point, was inconclusive and

14

required further development.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

In this

16

Court, we have a brief submitted by what they

17

purport to be the official interpreters of

18

Chinese law, which you'll hear in a couple of

19

minutes, and they say, one, it is Chinese law

20

that these individual companies -- like our

21

Webb-Pomerene association is what they are -­

22

they -- but they have to make an effort to get

23

together on price, and even if they don't,

24

someone who exports must export at the price

25

that the Chinese Webb-Pomerene association

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

fixes.

2

Normally, you get three producers in a

3

room, they can agree on price.

That isn't a

4

tough problem.

5

then, when they do agree, the key point is you

6

can't export unless you follow their price.

So -- so they'll agree.

And

7

Now I asked my clerk to go through the

8

record and see if there's anything in the lower

9

court that actually suggests that isn't Chinese

10
11

law.

Well, I don't know, not much.
So that's my question.

What is there?

12

What is there?

13

you shouldn't have used the word "reasonable

14

interpretation," you should have used the word

15

"respectful deference," what is there, given

16

the brief filed here, that you will use or

17

could use to suggest, or have used, I haven't

18

seen it here, that that isn't the law of China?

19

Before we send this back to say

MR. GOTTLIEB:

So, on the merits of

20

that question, Justice Breyer, the first thing

21

I would point out is that the Ministry's

22

interpretation of its regulations has not been

23

consistent through this case.

24

amicus brief that it submitted to the district

25

court, the Ministry interpreted its 1997

And in the 2006

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

regulations, which included a notice and a

2

charter of the Vitamin C subcommittee.

3

The notice had been repealed and the

4

-- and the charter of the Vitamin Sub -- C

5

subcommittee had been replaced.

6

provisions of the Vitamin C sub -- Vitamin C

7

subcommittee charter made clear that you did

8

not need to be a member of the committee

9

anymore to export, and that you -- and that you

The replaced

10

could, in fact, export Vitamin C without

11

participating in any of the pricing gap -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

That isn't my

13

question there, on that part.

14

there that suggests that a Chinese exporter

15

could set a price lower than the price set by

16

their equivalent to the Webb-Pomerene

17

association?

18

on that point?

19
20

It is what is

That's -- is there any evidence

MR. GOTTLIEB:

Absolutely, Justice

Breyer.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. GOTTLIEB:

What?
There are -- we have

23

documents in the case repeatedly demonstrating

24

that Chinese exporters did, in fact, sell their

25

products in the United States at lower than the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

$3.35 price point.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

That -­

3

that -- that would be a point.

4

might also equally prove that they don't all

5

follow the law.

6

MR. GOTTLIEB:

And yet that

With respect to that,

7

Justice Breyer, we also have documents from the

8

Chamber, one of which is cited at pages 398 to

9

400 of the Joint Appendix, showing that at

10

certain times during this case the Ministry of

11

Commerce did not list -- the Ministry or the

12

Chamber did not list an export price for

13

Vitamin C.

14

And we have documents as well that are

15

in the record demonstrating that the Chamber

16

understood this and the participants in the

17

system understood this, that for certain time

18

periods during the case, because the businesses

19

could not get together and agree upon a set

20

export price, they allowed the businesses to

21

export without a -- a set or mandatory export

22

price.

23

And -- and again, that's pages 397 to

24

400 of the Joint Appendix, as well -- as well

25

as other authorities that we've cited in our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

reply brief and our opening brief.

2

point of that is that not only -- there's an

3

additional point that the district court made

4

in its opinion for summary judgment, which is

5

that the 2002 notice, which they take as sort

6

of the central regulatory document in the case,

7

contained a suspension provision.

8
9

And the

It contained in it a provision that
said that the Chamber and its members can get

10

together when market conditions demand and

11

essentially stop the price review function of

12

the price verification and chop regime.

13

One of the problems that the district

14

court had with the Ministry's brief in this

15

case is that the 2006 amicus brief doesn't even

16

mention the existence of the suspension

17

provision.

18

offer an interpretation of it.

19

so here in this Court.

20

can't be faulted for not deferring -­

21

It doesn't construe it.

It doesn't

They have done

But the district court

JUSTICE BREYER:

We're not.

But, I

22

mean, in Pink and others, that's the other

23

part.

24

this Court, and shouldn't we take as given what

25

they say in that brief?

I don't know.

They filed a brief in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

MR. GOTTLIEB:

Justice Breyer, I don't

2

think that that is the lesson of Pink, if

3

that's -- if that's what your question is.

4

I don't think -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, fine.

And

But here

6

we have a government.

They say this is our

7

law.

8

to that question, but I think it could be that

9

we should take that as the law, unless you come

And is there -- I don't know the answer

10

up with a fairly good reason to think that

11

isn't a -- that isn't.

12

MR. GOTTLIEB:

Well, on the merits, I

13

think I've just described why the position is

14

wrong.

15

go, Justice Breyer, I'd point out that in the

16

Abbott case involving Chilean custody, you

17

joined Justice Stevens' dissent in that case.

18

But as far as this Court's precedents

And in Footnote 9 of Justice Stevens'

19

dissent, Justice Stevens attacked the

20

Chilean -- the interpretation of Chilean law

21

issued by the Chilean official in that case

22

because it was "a piece of advocacy."

23

This Court can and does and in many of

24

its cases has looked at the legal

25

interpretations rendered by foreign sovereigns

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

to determine their context, to determine the

2

authority of the source offering the

3

interpretation, and to determine whether the

4

question that is being addressed in the

5

interpretation is one of foreign law

6

exclusively or one that sort of sits at the

7

intersection of foreign law and U.S. law, which

8

is what this Court did in the Intel case in

9

rejecting the suggestions of the -- of the

10

European Commission when this Court rejected

11

very strong arguments made by the EC that the

12

United States' line between investigation and

13

adjudication did not map on well to the

14

European line.

15

And this Court in an 8-1 decision held

16

that -- that it would not accept the European

17

Commission's interpretation, with respect.

18

Now, specifically with respect to

19

Pink, we don't think that Pink was ever

20

intended to be a rule of perspective or binding

21

deference.

22

44.1 era when questions of foreign law were

23

typically and traditionally treated as

24

questions of fact rather than questions of law.

25

Pink was decided in the pre-Rule

And the lower court opinion in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

Moscow Fire case, the referee had held that the

2

United States had failed to meet its burden in

3

proving its case as to foreign law, which is -­

4

which would not be the type of inquiry in which

5

any case would engage in today.

6

So we think as the -- as the case came

7

to this Court, it would be a completely

8

different case today, and, in any event, the

9

United States was completely aligned in that

10

case with the position that was -- that was put

11

forth by the Commissariat for Justice from

12

Russia.

13

Here -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was no

14

suggestion in Pink that there was any

15

inconsistency in the position that the Soviet

16

Union was taking, and here we do have a

17

suggestion of inconsistency?

18

MR. GOTTLIEB:

That's correct.

Before

19

this Court reached -- before the -- the

20

sentences in this Court's opinion in Pink that

21

said that the Commissariat's declaration would

22

be conclusive, this Court stopped and paused to

23

note that the position that the United States

24

had taken in Pink was supported by powerful

25

expert testimony that was before the referee

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

below.

2

And -- and, additionally, there was a

3

specific finding on which this Court relied in

4

Pink that the referee had held that the

5

Commissariat for Justice had the power to issue

6

authoritative interpretations of Russian law.

7

By contrast, the referee in the -- in

8

the decision below in Moscow Fire had held that

9

the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs did not.

10

And so there was this preliminary question that

11

this Court would have to reach the chief -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Gottlieb,

13

could you state -- I read some words in the

14

opinion below that gave me pause.

15

below said:

16

when a foreign -- foreign government acting

17

through counsel or otherwise directly

18

participates in U.S. court proceedings by

19

providing a sworn evidentiary proffer regarding

20

the construction and effect of its laws and

21

regulations, which is reasonable under the

22

circumstances presented, a U.S. court is bound

23

to defer to these statements."

24
25

The court

"We reaffirm the principle that

I guess, what are you challenging or
what -- can you just give me a bullet point

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

listing of where the court erred in that

2

statement?

3

MR. GOTTLIEB:

We think the Court

4

erred in saying that the district court was

5

bound to defer, particularly at the motion to

6

I think, first, you're saying the

can actually say what the law is as a final

MR. GOTTLIEB:

10

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.
All right.

So the

first inquiry is, is it a final statement, is
it someone who's reliable.

11

MR. GOTTLIEB:

What else?

Well, so, Justice

12

Sotomayor, the court would also have to

13

determine whether the supreme -- whether that

14

highest court's opinion is dispositive of the

15

question presented, whether it actually speaks

16

to the question that's before the United States

And imagine that that same court

received a -- a -- a later decided opinion from

that same foreign highest court that appeared

forward by the foreign sovereign interpreting

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

9
10
11
12
13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS
CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FLETCHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
If I could start with Justice

14

Sotomayor's question to my colleague about

15

where the Second Circuit went wrong.

16

it's useful to distinguish between what we see

17

as two related but distinct mistakes that the

18

Second Circuit made.

19

I think

One of them relates to how much weight

20

or deference a federal court should have given

21

to a submission like the Ministry's amicus

22

brief in this case, and that's the question

23

that the parties have really focused on.

24

do want to explain why we think that the

25

standard that the Second Circuit articulated is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And I

Official
24
1

-- is too rigid and too deferential to foreign

2

sovereign submissions.

3

But there's another important mistake

4

that we think the Second Circuit made.

And on

5

that, we think my friends on this side of the

6

table actually really aren't defending what the

7

Second Circuit has done, and that is in

8

defining what's the universe of materials that

9

a U.S. court can consider in applying the

10

appropriate standard of deference in assessing

11

the foreign government's submission and

12

ultimately in determining what foreign law is.

13

And what we understand the Second

14

Circuit to have done -- and this is the

15

clearest in Footnote 10 of its opinion on page

16

30a -- is to say that when a foreign government

17

presents its views about the construction of

18

its laws to a U.S. court, the U.S. court is

19

bound to defer if that construction is facially

20

reasonable and the U.S. court cannot look

21

behind that construction to things like

22

contradictory statements in other fora or to

23

other relevant materials on foreign law that

24

cast doubt on the foreign sovereign's

25

representation.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

And we think that was a serious error.

2

And we think it's reflected in the way that

3

this case has unfolded.

4

the motion to dismiss stage, said I have the

5

Ministry's brief, it's due deference, but I

6

still have questions and I need more

7

information.

8

9

different things that it believed bore on the

The district court, at

It then developed at the summary

10

relevant question of Chinese law.

11

analysis runs to some 50 pages.

12

That

And the Second Circuit said, in that

13

footnote that I referenced earlier, that the

14

district court's consideration of that material

15

would have been "entirely appropriate" had the

16

Ministry not appeared in this case.

17

But the Second Circuit believed that

18

because the Ministry had appeared, that inquiry

19

and that analysis of the Ministry's other

20

statements and of the other evidence wasn't

21

appropriate.

22

Circuit didn't consider any of that and so

23

hasn't adjudicated a lot of the debates about

24

the meaning of Chinese law that the parties are

25

now trying to have before you in the first

And, therefore, the Second

instance.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So -- so

8

Reasonable seems

So what are the words that these

MR. FLETCHER:

So, first, just to

9

close out the point I was speaking to earlier,

10

I think the words that you should write to fix

11

the first error that I was focused on there,

12

about the universe of materials, is that when

13

it gets one of these submissions, a federal

14

court is never required -- required to close

15

its eyes to other materials that it believes

16

bear on the question; that applying whatever

17

standard you decide is the right form of words,

18

the federal court gets to apply that standard

19

with the benefit of all of the evidence that it

20

believes is relevant, including, for example,

21

other representations by the foreign sovereign

22

in other fora.

23

Now, on the question -­

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Is that -- would

that include here the representation to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

World Trade Organization?

2

MR. FLETCHER:

That -- the district

3

court did believe that was important here.

4

-- I don't understand either Respondents or the

5

Ministry to argue that that sort of potential

6

inconsistency that the district court found

7

between what China was telling the district

8

court in this case and what it had told the WTO

9

in other cases isn't relevant to the weight

10

that a foreign sovereign's submission should

11

receive.

I

12

Here, I understand the Ministry and

13

Respondents think that there was no

14

inconsistency, and that's a question that would

15

be -- remain to be settled on remand by the

16

Second Circuit.

17

sort of inconsistency is potentially relevant.

18

And, Justice Breyer, to your question

But, yes, absolutely, that

19

about then what's the form of words, how to say

20

the sort of amount of deference, we would urge

21

the Court not to do what the Second Circuit

22

did, which is to try to articulate something

23

like a Chevron-type rule, a sort of one size

24

fits all, if the foreign sovereign's

25

interpretation is reasonable or if it meets

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

some other standard, then it's binding and

2

that's the end of the case.

3

And the reason why we'd urge you away

4

from a standard like that -- well, there are

5

actually two important reasons.

6

don't see any support for that in international

7

practice.

8

exactly right to say that U.S. courts should

9

afford foreign sovereigns' submissions the same

One is that we

We think that the Second Circuit was

10

sort of weight and consideration that we would

11

respect -- expect in courts of other countries.

12

But the United States does not expect

13

and does not receive that sort of binding

14

deference or deference to anything that's

15

reasonable that we say about U.S. law when -­

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, if it's not

17

supposed to be that, and we're not supposed to

18

tell them, what is it we're supposed to say?

19

And if you say open the door, maybe we could

20

say, of course, do whatever the State

21

Department tells you.

22

making it sound facetious, but there -- there

23

-- you can work out that kind of thing.

24

that what you want?

25

MR. FLETCHER:

I mean, that is -- I'm

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

MR. FLETCHER:

I mean, what?
-- anytime, if the

3

State Department appears in the case, that's

4

going to be relevant and we hope that the

5

courts would take that into account.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is, of course,

7

the risk that the State Department will say

8

thing A when it's country A and B when it's

9

country B.

10

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, and also the

State Department may not be there.

4

other than some general word like "respectful

deference"?

Should we say that?

MR. FLETCHER:

I think -- I would

separate out two things.

I would say always

respectful consideration.

We'd be very

10

to what foreign sovereigns had to say and were

11

not considering them with respect.

12

I would also say that it would be

13

appropriate to say that, ordinarily, the

14

submission from a foreign government is going

15

to get substantial weight, is entitled to

16

substantial weight.

17

the weight that it's entitled to is inevitably

18

going to depend on the circumstances.

But, yes, we think that

United States on behalf of the U.S. Department

Are they treated the same way?

MR. FLETCHER:

No.

I think the brief

3

for the Department of Commerce would depend on

4

the authority that the Department of Commerce

5

had in that context if it was describing an

6

interpretation it had adopted in the exercise

7

of authority under Chevron.

I

think both of them -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

MR. FLETCHER:

Why not?
Both of them are

20

entitled to respect.

21

weight that the U.S. government's submission is

22

entitled to will be determined under domestic

23

administrative law doctrines, like Chevron,

24

like Skidmore, things like that.

25

The respect and the

The weight -- the foreign government's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

submission should also get weight, but the

2

factors that would inform the degree of weight

3

that it should be given are going to depend on

4

the foreign legal system and might differ, just

5

to give a few examples, on whether or not it's

6

interpreting regulations that that Ministry

7

actually administers or is interpreting perhaps

8

some common law question or some provincial law

9

question that the Ministry actually has nothing

10
11

to do with, right?
And so part of our point is that

12

federal courts are actually presented with

13

interpretations that could be characterized as

14

falling within the Second Circuit -­

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I -- I'm curious.

16

So -- so federal agencies get deference, but

17

foreign countries don't.

18

I -- I got that.

But what -- what -- what does the

19

State Department do in foreign litigation when

20

a domestic -- American law is at issue?

21

it seek Chevron deference in -- from foreign

22

courts in the interpretation of American law?

You'd argue the same

thing here?
MR. FLETCHER:

Of course, that

would be appropriate to consider.

My point is

22

just it depends on the authority of the

23

interpretation within the foreign legal system.

25

Well, let me

6

reformulate my question.

Suppose the foreign

8

like the United States, except it's not the

It's a foreign country.

So the

Would they get -­

21

MR. FLETCHER:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
Would they get -­
Yeah.

Is there

23

anything about the fact that one is different

24

-- is a foreign country and one is the United

25

States that would point to different treatment?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

MR. FLETCHER:

Potentially yes.

And I

2

think there, potentially, there are factors

3

that would merit giving more deference to the

4

foreign government's interpretation, in part

5

because it's a different legal system that the

6

court isn't going to be familiar with and that

7

the foreign government can explain that

8

wouldn't come into play in the domestic legal

9

system.

10

So this is not a one-way ratchet, and

11

we're not suggesting that foreign sovereign

12

representations are not entitled to weight or

13

don't merit deference.

14

submission is just that it's going to

15

inevitably depend on the circumstances and that

16

those circumstances have to be evaluated on a

17

case-by-case basis.

Our principal

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, when -­
Suppose you have two

20

-- two questions -- two different cases.

21

is, what is the general principle of the

22

foreign country, what is the general principle

23

of law, like a restatement, the restatement of

24

law?

25

The other is, was this conduct

Heritage Reporting Corporation

One

mandated by the government -- by the foreign

2

government in a particular case?

3

difference as to what deference we should give

4

in case one and case two?

5

MR. FLETCHER:

Any

I guess it depends.

6

And I -- I know that's not a helpful answer to

7

give, but I think it's going to depend on the

8

circumstances, particularly if it's

9

restatement-type common law and the relevant

10

government agency doesn't have any authority to

11

interpret common law, that would be decided

12

solely by the foreign courts, that would cut

13

against deference, and, you know, if, in

14

contrast, the agency was saying it's our

15

regulations that require the compulsion, that

16

would counsel in favor of deference, but there

17

would be lots of other considerations.

I don't know that I can give a categorical

answer.

ON BEHALF OF THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE OF THE

IN SUPPORT OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
And maybe I -- may I begin by

8

expressing the thanks of the Ministry of

9

Commerce -- Commerce for allowing me to

10

participate in the oral argument today.

11

At some point, I'd like to get to

12

somewhat higher level, but I want to start off

13

with a couple of points that it seems my

14

colleagues made that -- that warrant correction

15

at this stage.

16

First of all, Mr. Gottlieb suggested

17

that the kind of program, Justice Breyer, that

18

you described, the -- the price verification

19

and chop, didn't actually operate that way,

20

that there was some gap, and he cited a couple

21

of pages in the Joint Appendix.

22

just quote those pages from the Joint Appendix,

23

and you can evaluate them for yourselves.

24
25

There, it does say:

And I would

"No consensus was

says that they keep the price as it was before.
A second statement is:

"The agreed

6

limit on the floor prices but not on the

7

ceiling prices."

8
9

That

We put the

I don't think there's any serious
doubt, candidly, that what we have here is the

10

system that we described both to the district

11

court and have described to this Court that you

12

had to get approval.

13

everybody did.

14

completely enforce the laws.

15

the same thing as saying that, well, you don't

16

have some kind of maximum speed limits because

17

people violate those speed laws all the time.

18

That's not to say that

I'm not saying we can

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it's about

What do you do with

19

the representation of China to the World Trade

20

Organization that it had given up export

21

administration of Vitamin C in 2001 and that it

22

was a matter of voluntary agreement, with no

23

coercion on the part of the government, with no

24

government intervention?

25

That -- that was a statement made by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

China to the World Trade Organization.

2

seems directly contrary to its position here.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

It

I would -- I would take

4

probably three positions with respect to that.

5

First, it seems to me the right answer for that

6

problem is, if the government's got a problem

7

with it, take it up with the World Trade

8

Organization and -- and let that organization

9

deal with those issues.

10

And, indeed, it's interesting that the

11

United States, of course, quotes our briefs

12

filed in the district court before the WTO in

13

suggesting that we had violated our obligations

14

under the WTO.

15

So it seems to me the answer is not

16

give less deference to what a foreign

17

government says to a federal court, but,

18

rather, if there's a concern, deal with the

19

concern directly with the -­

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it isn't -­

21

it's inconsistent to say the government compels

22

us, that -- yes, our government compels this

23

action by private actors -­

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- and telling

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

This is a matter of what the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

And -- and,

5

Justice Ginsburg, I think the answer -- the

6

second answer I would give is that that was the

7

context that we provided to the district court

8

and explained exactly why the position we took

9

before the WTO was completely consistent with

10

the position we put before the district court.

11

And what we said was that, in 1997, we

12

had a compulsory scheme where the MOFCOM itself

13

essentially set the prices directly through the

14

Chamber.

15

which we said, look, you guys negotiate among

16

yourselves, come up with a price, tell us what

17

it is, and then we will enforce that price.

18

In 2002, we adopted the PVC method in

And that's the approach that we took.

19

That's what we said to the WTO.

So that when

20

we said that we had abandoned export

21

administration, we did as to certain elements,

22

but what we never said to them and what it was

23

absolutely clear from the entire submission is

24

that we maintained minimum export price

25

requirements, that those were retained

Heritage Reporting Corporation

throughout.

2

And the United States in its

3

submission to the WTO specifically said,

4

quoting our language, that China retained

5

minimum price requirements and that that's the

6

rule in place, and that was the rule in place

So the sort of argument you were just

making, which is a typical legal argument in

inappropriate under your position.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I think that's

24

what this Court said in Pink.

The Court

25

basically said -- and -- and I would take the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

Solicitor General in 1984 and 1985's position

2

in the Matsushita case, which is a slight gloss

3

on Pink, that basically says, if a foreign

4

government comes to a U.S. court and says with

5

clarity and -- and unambiguously this is the

6

law, this is our foreign law, this is what it

7

means, that the Court ought to abide by that,

8

unless it's unclear or unless it's incredible

on its face.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the -­

the -- being informed by the United States that

the United States itself does not urge before

So, if the United States went to a -­

6

to another government, let's take -- let's pick

7

France, just to get out of picking governments,

8

but -- and said to them that what -- what

9

happened in the United States was consistent

10

with the rule of reason under Section 1 of the

11

Sherman Act, and for some reason, that's

12

directly relevant to France -- French law, if

13

the French -- if a French court were to come

14

back and say:

15

Section 1 that says all restraints of trade are

16

illegal, and you come and tell me about rule of

reason, I read your cases as saying there are

18

per se illegalities and you come here telling

19

me about rule of reason?

20

Wait a second, I read your

I doubt -- I mean, the -- the notion

21

that this was a respectful analysis of -- of

22

China's, you know, when you say at the end this

23

is a post-hoc attempt to shield somebody's

24

behavior, that's not respect.

opposite of respect.

That's the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Everything you take from the argument

2

on the other side, the best you can come up

3

with is there might have been some ambiguity in

4

the law.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what should we

say in general?

I just want you to reach that,

because I can see three possible things.

what the law of Texas is, whether they held the

Another possibility:

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.
Okay.

Okay.

You see?

Another

16

possibility:

17

for the power to persuade but not the power to

We take it

And maybe we could limit it to the

22

instance where it's the highest interpretive

authority of the state, or nearly that, and

24

instances where there are four professors

getting into an argument about it.

I'm worried about what words to put in.

You're worried about winning.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, no, Justice

Breyer, I'm actually -- I have the same concern

8

about the words, because the truth is, if you

9

quote the language of the Second Circuit, which

10

you quoted, I won't go through it, but, you

11

know, where it talks about which is reasonable

12

under the circumstances presented, in the

13

context of having had all of the circumstances

14

presented to it, I don't know how this Court's

That seems to me -­

put in the opinion, at least in respect to the

highest or near highest authority or -- or -­

MR. PHILLIPS:

Personally, I'd go back

that the Solicitor General adopted in 1984,

which says that you should give a conclusive

that rule.

first of all, in -- in -- in response to the

Solicitor General's position that the court of

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, except that in

3

the context of the case where the previous

4

litigation had, in fact, decided exactly the

5

opposite and the Court acknowledged that there

6

was voluminous -- a voluminous record which

7

suggests that there was a very significant

8

argument that there was an extraterritorial

9

effect, all the Court had before it that -­

10

that it relied upon was a statement of the

11

highest Ministry, this is the Ministry of

12

Justice, just -- the same as the Ministry of

13

Commerce here, to interpret that particular

14

provision saying it has extraterritorial

15

effect.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'll look at

it again, but it says the referee in the Moscow

case found and the evidence supported his

finding that the Commissariat for Justice had

the power to interpret existing Russian law.

found it reliable.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't the second what

the Second Circuit said?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, that's exactly

24

what the Second Circuit said, but -- and -- and

25

the reason why the Second Circuit's position is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

important and should be upheld is that there

2

are two purposes for this kind of deference to

3

foreign governments.

4

One is we should get it right.

And,

5

candidly, the right answer in this case is we

6

had a minimum price regime and we enforced it,

7

and -- and it dictated the outcome of this

8

case.

9

claim.

10

And it is the basis for the antitrust

And you -- you may have other comity

11

considerations that say, well, you apply it,

12

but in this case, this was litigated, it all

13

turned on what Chinese law required, and

14

Chinese law required the plaintiff -- the

15

defendants to do precisely what they did in

16

this case.

17

And then the second part of it is the

18

respect to a foreign government.

And by not

19

following what MOFCOM told them, the district

20

judge ends up adopting what the court of

21

appeals quite rightly describes as a

22

nonsensical outcome in this case.

23

we know that the right answer is what we said,

24

is there is a minimum price regime and it ought

25

to be applied under these circumstances.

Therefore,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But how -- how can you

2

say that the only thing that shows respect to

3

foreign governments is to do something that we

4

don't know that any other foreign nation does?

5

I mean, presumably, all these foreign nations

are doing something more like Justice Alito's

first option, which is giving respectful

consideration.

what comity demands as an international matter.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN JACOBSON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. JACOBSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I think the best case to start the

7

deference inquiry in this case is by

8

recognizing that the only way the 2002

9

regulation makes sense is under the Ministry's

10
11

interpretation.
Under the regulations, price fixing

12

was clearly required under the 2002 regime.

13

And the -- those regulations make no sense at

14

all under the construction offered by the

15

Petitioners in the district court.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Doesn't that go to

17

the merits of the issue here?

18

don't know that it answers the legal question

19

we're looking at, which is the court below

20

didn't go through the body of evidence that

21

Rule 44.1 permits and say there's some

22

contradictory evidence, but it doesn't make

23

sense in light of the minister's explanation.

24

MR. JACOBSON:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That I -- I

57

the Second Circuit should have done?

2

MR. JACOBSON:

Justice -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What it did was

4

look at the minister's explanation without

5

addressing any potential conflicting evidence

6

and saying it really doesn't conflict.

7

MR. JACOBSON:

So -- so, Justice

8

Sotomayor, I think if you look at pages 9a and

9

27 to 28a of the opinion, you'll see that what

10

the Second Circuit did is it looked at the text

11

of the 2002 regulation, said that appears to

12

require price fixing, but there are some

13

ambiguous terms.

14

those ambiguous terms, that is where deference

15

was granted to the Ministry.

16

entirely consistent with what you are

suggesting.

23

these other things, including what China told

There were several reasons the

There were -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

that what the Eastern District did was wrong,

2

to take -- to look at those other sources?

3

MR. JACOBSON:

I -- I don't believe

4

so, Your Honor.

5

when you have the 2002 regulation and you look

6

at the explanation by the Ministry, you don't

7

need to go further.

8
9

I think what the court said is

There is a footnote -- it's Footnote
14 in the court of appeals' opinion -- where it

10

-- where the court explains that there may be

11

instances where you have to go further, but

12

this is not one of them.

13

And -- and I do want to address the -­

14

the issue raised by -- by Justice Kagan and

15

Justice Ginsburg about other countries, what do

16

other countries do.

17

question.

18

It's an important

The -- the Europe -- the answer truly

19

is we don't know.

The -- the European

20

Convention that we've been talking about for

21

the last few minutes is one where it doesn't

address the formal submission of a foreign

23

That's the -- do we

draw that distinction, the formal submission of

The reason I ask that is

6

MR. JACOBSON:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I do.
All right.

My

8

impression, not practicing in the area, is

9

these -- this is an unusual case because this

10

normally arises, say, in a contract dispute

11

among private parties, and it says interpret it

according to the law of China.

what it is, and they'll conflict.

17

the sovereign country of China is itself

interested, and that's why they've submitted

this.

And the

That's the

This is an unusual case because

Now do we recognize that in an opinion

them.

its own laws should be controlling.

16

So the Intel case was raised.

This

17

Court made clear in Intel that the European -­

18

that it was accepting the European Union's

19

construction of its own law.

20

was, what does this mean under U.S. law?

21

was the Intel decision.

22

The difference
That

And that is always going to be true.

23

The foreign government can tell the court what

24

foreign law means, but the U.S. court has to

25

decide what the implications are of that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

foreign law when reaching its decision.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the entity

3

that submits the brief on behalf of the foreign

4

country does not have the authority under the

5

law of that country to dictate what the law is?

6

What if the entity is like the executive branch

7

of the government of the United States, which

8

does not have the authority to dictate what the

9

law is?

10

It -- it can express an opinion, and

11

that's generally -- it's very often correct and

12

it's entitled to respectful consideration.

13

MR. JACOBSON:

I -- I think, in that

14

instance, respectful deference is an

15

appropriate standard.

16
17
18

That is not this case.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why is it not

this case?
MR. JACOBSON:

Because MOFCOM creates

19

the regulations, interprets the regulations,

20

and enforces the regulations.

21

a brief by Chinese professors who explain the

22

rule that the rule-maker has the authority to

23

interpret its own rules in China and that that

24

authority is dispositive.

25

this different than -- than Chevron deference.

And there's a -­

That's what makes

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

It makes it much closer to a certificate -- a

2

certificate to a state supreme court, very,

3

very similar.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I have -­

5

I don't understand this constant emphasis on

6

respectful.

7

disagree, right?

8

due respect" usually means the person's about

9

to say you don't know what you're talking

10

It doesn't mean that you can't
I mean, you know, "with all

about.

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. JACOBSON:

13

Respectfully, Your

Honor -­

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. JACOBSON:

So -- so I believe,

16

when a foreign government comes in with an

17

official statement of its own laws, respectful

18

deference is not a sufficient standard.

19

The deference standard should be -­

20

and -- and, Justice Breyer, this goes to the

21

question that you've been asking throughout -­

22

I think, if you look at the first paragraph on

23

page 23 of the Solicitor General's brief in the

24

Matsushita case, that is the correct standard

25

to apply here.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, just to be

2

clear, respectful really plays no role, right?

3

I mean, if you wanted to say -- to the

4

government and say, well, all right, I guess

5

you're right, I guess I have to defer to this,

6

you might say that's disrespectful, but that's

7

all that matters, right, whether you're going

8

to -- and by "defer," you mean accept, whether

9

you're going to accept the proposition or not,

10

right?

11

MR. JACOBSON:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

Yes.
It's not

enough to be respectful.

14

MR. JACOBSON:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

I -- I thought you

17

just told me that if the entity that submitted

18

the brief on behalf of the foreign country does

19

not have the authority to dictate foreign law,

20

then all it should get is respectful

21

consideration but that this case is different.

22

But then you seem to have turned around and

23

said no, the rule across the board is that you

24

follow what the foreign government submits.

25

So which is it?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

MR. JACOBSON:

So I -- I'm equating

2

the foreign government with the entity that has

3

the authority to interpret law under those

4

circumstances.

5
6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could this issue ever

come up in China -- in the Chinese courts?

7

MR. JACOBSON:

8

regime has changed.

9

2008.

I suspect so.

The

PVC was eliminated in

The related restrictions were eliminated

10

in 2010.

11

today's milieu, that that would arise, but I -­

12

I suspect it could.

13

So it's difficult to see how, in

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't understand

14

enough about the Chinese legal system, but

15

could this come before the Supreme People's

16

Court?

17

MR. JACOBSON:

Well, in -- in -- with

18

-- without exhausting all of the myriad

19

contexts in which it might arise,

20

hypothetically, I would think so.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

And would they just

22

say, okay, this is what the Ministry of

23

Commerce says; that's the end of the matter?

24

MR. JACOBSON:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, absolutely.
And can you point to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

something that shows that?

2

MR. JACOBSON:

It's the -- the

3

principle that the rule-maker has the authority

4

to interpret its own rules.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It -­
Does the Supreme

6

People's Court deal with cases like this?

7

Isn't it true that, in most commercial matters,

8

the courts are not used but arbitrators are?

9

MR. JACOBSON:

Justice Ginsburg, I

10

honestly don't know the answer to -- to that

11

question.

12

point that you've made a couple of times,

13

Justice Ginsburg, about a suggestion of

14

inconsistency.

15

I do -- I do want to address the

There's absolutely no inconsistency in

16

what China told the WTO about giving up export

17

administration.

18

continued use, the repeated use and reliance,

19

by the United States, by the European

20

Commission, by Mexico, and, ultimately, by the

21

WTO agreeing with the USTR's submissions in

22

that case, none of which suggested any

23

inconsistency on the part of China.

What confirms that is the

24

And we have explained in our brief -­

25

this is at pages 12 and -- and 40 to 41 of our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

brief -- precisely why giving up export

2

administration is entirely consistent with the

3

regulations, because prior to 2002, what China

4

did to enforce the -- the price-fixing

5

mechanism was to require transactional quotas

6

and licenses for each transaction.

7

page 428 of -- of the Joint Appendix.

That's at

8

And what the implications of that are

9

is that the result of the -- of the conduct is

10

being compelled by the Chinese government and

11

is -- is illegal under U.S. law.

12

My -- my time is running out.

13

want to address a point, if I may, in the reply

14

brief the Petitioners submitted, which is the

15

argument that the regime is actually logical

16

under the district court's interpretation.

17

there are four reasons why -- why that is not

18

true.

19

I do

And

One, the -- the idea that this is

20

entirely voluntary and -- and not mandated is

21

completely contradicted by the language in the

22

2002 and 2003 regulations, which use the word

23

"shall" repeatedly, use the word "must."

24

clearly in -- in that context, mandatory.

25

It's

Second, a point that we really haven't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

addressed sufficiently, what happened from 1997

2

to 2001 is that the regulatory regime in 1997

3

failed.

4

war in 2001 that was very destructive to the

5

Chinese economy.

All right?

6

It -- it led to a price

The idea that China would then change

7

the regulatory system to one in which price

8

fixing is -- is not mandated would result in

9

lower prices, not higher prices.

10

And what

China was trying to achieve was higher prices.

11

Third, the -- the argument doesn't

12

explain why the regulations would insist on

13

compliance with industry agreements if industry

14

agreements were not required in the first

15

place.

16

Circuit.

17

That was the point made by the Second

And then, finally, agreements on

18

minimum prices are clearly illegal per se, even

19

if people charge a higher price than that.

20

That's the Plymouth Dealers case from the Ninth

21

Circuit in 1960.

22

DOJ's position in the Matsushita case.

23

consistent with Socony and this Court's 1943

24

decision in the American Medical Association

25

case.

It is consistent with the
It's

And, finally, it's -- it's entirely

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1

consistent with Catalano against Target Sales,

2

a per curiam decision from this Court in 1980.

3

What the Chinese law required was

4

unambiguously price fixing that was in conflict

5

with U.S. law, and that is why, in reaching the

6

determination whether to -- to affirm, vacate,

7

or reverse, we believe the appropriate

8

disposition is to affirm.

9

If there's nothing further.

Mr. Gottlieb, two minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. GOTTLIEB

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15
16
17

Thank you,

MR. GOTTLIEB:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I'd like to start with a question that

18

Justice Kagan asked, which was the question

19

about whether Chinese courts would -- would

20

provide this kind of deference.

21

There's no indication that Chinese

22

courts would provide a rule of binding

23

deference, and their amicus brief that they

24

have from Chinese scholars on this precise

25

question doesn't make that argument.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1

The importance of this point is it

2

shows that the rule for which the Ministry is

3

advocating here and which Respondents are

4

advocating would place the United States alone

5

in the world.

6

China doesn't apply this kind of

7

binding deference.

The United States doesn't

8

ask for it.

9

nation supports the Ministry's rule, as our -­

It doesn't apply it.

No other

10

as the amicus brief from the conflicts of law

11

scholars provides.

12

And in this Court, China is the only

13

nation that is appearing before this Court

14

urging reversal.

15

that opposing counsel mentioned, seven other

16

nations appeared asking this Court to constrict

17

-- to restrict the reach of U.S. antitrust

18

laws.

19

In Hartford Fire, two other nations joined.

20

In -- in the Empagran case,

In Morrison, three other nations joined.

In -- in this case, all you have is

21

China advocating for this rule.

And the reason

22

is because the -- the international standard

23

simply does not support a requirement of

24

binding deference because courts respect the

25

independence of judicial branches that exist in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
70
1

other countries to answer the legal questions

2

that are put to them.

3

The costs of adopting such a rule that

4

the Ministry and the Respondents are proposing

5

are substantial.

6

are built into trying to figure out who the

7

right arm of the foreign sovereign is.

8

that's not a hypothetical problem.

9

the McNab case, as described in our briefs.

10

There are accuracy costs that

And

It arose in
It

also arose in the Samantar case.

11

And the rule that you simply defer to

12

whatever foreign sovereign appears could put

13

U.S. courts in a very delicate position without

14

any guidance for how to answer the question of

15

which arm of the sovereign is authoritative.

16

It also creates the risk that the

17

United States will not enforce United States

18

laws in -- or interpret them in the way they're

19

supposed to be interpreted in those areas where

20

questions of foreign law bleed into United

21

States law, as it does -- as they do

22

consistently in cases involving -- in cases

23

involving issues like antitrust.
