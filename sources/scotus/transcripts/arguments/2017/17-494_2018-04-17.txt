ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTY J. JACKLEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. JACKLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
There are two very significant

12

consequences brought about by Quill:

13

our states are losing massive sales tax

14

revenues that we need for education,

15

healthcare, and infrastructure.

16

First,

Second, our small businesses on Main

17

Street are being harmed because of the unlevel

18

playing field created by Quill, where

19

out-of-state remote sellers are given a price

20

advantage.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Isn't

22

the problem not Quill but the fact that you

23

don't have a mechanism to collect from

24

consumers?

25

playing -- paying the sales tax; it's the

It's not the merchants who are

consumer.

2

find a way to collect from them.

3

They're collecting it for you.

MR. JACKLEY:

So

Justice Sotomayor --

4

Sotomayor, we believe that we have a right,

5

because we have a statutory scheme in place

6

that is nondiscriminatory, there aren't

7

apportionment issues, it's a fair scheme, it

8

has safe harbors in place to allow our state to

9

--

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your scheme.

But

11

I'm not concerned about your scheme as such.

12

I'm concerned about the many unanswered

13

questions that overturning precedents will

14

create a massive amount of lawsuits about.

15

I know you've told us that Quill has

16

created its own set of lawsuits, I guess every

17

law does, but here there are some significant

18

ones.

19

adversaries point out that there are many

20

states who have already made this collection

21

retroactive.

22

You're not retroactive, but your

So we have that question.

We have questions about what's the

23

contact that you have to do to impose this

24

obligation.

Are we going to decide it under

3

4

How much contact is enough to

So there's going to be a host of

5

questions.

What happens when the tax program

6

breaks down, as it already has for the states

7

who are using it, and merchants can't keep

8

track of who they've sold to?

9

questions that are wrought with difficulties.

All of these are

10

So you're introducing now a whole new set of

11

difficulties to put be -- to put behind

12

something that's been in place for 30 years

13

now?

14

MR. JACKLEY:

Justice Sotomayor, we

15

would encourage using the doctrines that are

16

already in place with Complete Auto when it

17

comes to a tax assessment to look for

18

discrimination, to look for apportionment

19

issues, to look at that substantial nexus.

amount.

What's the minimum everywhere else?

The minimum would be one

13

that creates the nexus.

And then, if you go -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what are we

15

going to do with the costs that you're going to

put on small businesses?

17

MR. JACKLEY:

The small businesses are

18

the ones that are affected most by Quill.

19

you look at that small business on Main Street,

20

it is that business that is put at a price

21

disadvantage because of Quill.

22

If you look at what the -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If

Actually, they're

24

put at disadvantage, not by Quill, but by the

25

fact that there are massive discount sellers,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7

not just on the Internet, but even in stores

2

now.

3

doing business for the small businessman,

4

someone -- one of the briefs said it was a

5

$250,000 cost to implement one of these sales

6

programs, one of these sales tax programs?

7

I -- I'm talking about the added cost of

MR. JACKLEY:

That brief left out that

8

it begins -- it's to scale, and it begins at

9

$12 a month for 30 transactions.

When you look

10

at the cost associated with collection, it -­

11

it really depends -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That doesn't

include auditing.

integrating the program with the existing sales

program of the company.

16

the maintenance of the program.

17
18
19

It doesn't include

It doesn't account for

There's lots of costs that are
inherent in a process of this type.
MR. JACKLEY:

One thing to look at is

20

the fact that all these sellers, at least in

21

the 45 states with a sales tax, already have a

22

collection and a remittance obligation and

23

already have in place the software that is able

24

to calculate -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's five states that don't centralize the

state and local.

MR. JACKLEY:

With those five states,

4

as -- as indicated from the briefing, it's to

5

scale.

6

transactions.

7

to look at when it comes to burden is Quill, in

8

the physical presence, doesn't address that

9

issue.

And it begins at $12 a month for 30
And I think the important thing

It doesn't address that issue because,

10

as shown in National Geographic, you may have a

11

situation where there's a warehouse, there's

12

goods that are warehoused in a particular

13

locality where it will still trigger the sales

14

tax obligation.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but did

16

I understand you to acknowledge that there

17

would be a constitutional minimum with respect

18

to the burdens?

19

businesses would not -- you could not impose

20

the obligation on some small businesses?

21

In other words, that some

MR. JACKLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice,

22

certainly, that's what Pike is for, is to

23

determine in a balancing if there is a

24

constitutional concern, if there is a Commerce

25

Clause concern.

6

lowest level for things like a physical

10

I mean, isn't it one person,

So that -- that would be another

MR. JACKLEY:

You know, certainly,

11

that's one way to look at it, yes, that when

It can be a traveling salesperson

The other important thing to look at

19

when it comes to burden is the state schemes

20

that are being put in place, such as in

21

Colorado with the notice and the reporting

22

requirement, those are burdens that are of

23

equal or perhaps even greater than a simple

24

collection and remittance of a tax.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you have -- if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10

there are two options, let's say option A is

2

eliminate Quill and states can do whatever they

3

want with respect to retroactive liability and

4

with respect to the minimum number of sales

5

that are required in the state in order for the

6

sales to be taxed, in order to require them to

7

collect the tax.

8
9

That's option A.

Option B is a congressional scheme
that deals with all of these problems.

10

those are the only two options, which is

11

preferable?

If

12

MR. JACKLEY:

13

for Option A is this:

14

years to address this issue.

15

Congress, but it's Quill, it's this Court's

16

decision, that is striking down our state

17

statutes.

But, General, usually,

19

when somebody says something like that, that

20

Congress has not addressed an issue for 25-plus

21

years, you know, it -- it gives us reason to

22

pause, because Congress could have addressed

23

the issue and Congress chose not to.

This is not the kind of issue where

MR. JACKLEY:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I

It is, Justice Ginsburg.
If that's your

5

answer, isn't it normal that we treat a dormant

6

Commerce Clause case the same way we treat

7

statutes?

8
9

I mean, I think the examples are
legion.

Congress cannot overturn

10

constitutional decisions, but, in the dormant

11

Commerce Clause case, it's different, and of

12

course they can, and of course they do.

13
14

So I don't really see a difference
there.

15

So what's the difference?
MR. JACKLEY:

Justice Breyer, I would

16

still say there's a difference because this is

17

a constitutional interpretation.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, but the word

19

constitutional is not magic.

20

we say we are more willing to overturn a

21

constitutional case is because Congress can't

22

act.

23

The reason that

But, here, they can act.

And,

24

therefore, there is no reason for treating it

25

specially.

What is the response to that?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

MR. JACKLEY:

I think the reason to

2

treat it special is because we have a situation

3

where Congress has had 26 years.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

They -­

Well, we have briefs

5

from three Senators and Congressman Goodlatte

6

that says Congress was about to act.

7

indeed, what stopped them from acting was our

8

decision to decide this case.

MR. JACKLEY:

10

And,

I -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now that's -- that's

11

their view of it.

better view.

18

And between whether they

And you are 50

If you do not have the power to get

MR. JACKLEY:

Congress doesn't have an

19

incentive in this instance to take action in

20

something that could be perceived as a tax when

21

yet they don't get the opportunity to use the

22

revenue.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, as things stand

24

now, it seems that both the states and Internet

25

retailers have an incentive to ask for a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

congressional solution to this problem.

2

So the Internet retailers will have to

3

deal with statutes like the Colorado reporting

4

statute and with aggressive moves by the states

5

to try to bring taxation within Quill in some

6

way.

7

And the states, obviously, have an

8

incentive to require retail -- Internet

9

retailers to collect the tax.

So there are

10

incentives on both sides.

11

overruled, what incentives do the states have

12

to ask for any kind of congressional

13

legislation?

14

MR. JACKLEY:

But if Quill is

Well, certainly, if -­

15

if Quill is overruled, the states will have

16

their constitutional responsibilities to follow

17

Complete Auto and to follow Pike.

18

I mean, what really has happened here

19

is, in Quill, this Court set the default.

20

set the baseline.

21

non-discriminatory as it may be and as

22

reasonable as it may be, such as South

23

Dakota's, it's automatically unconstitutional

24

and struck down.

25

It

So where a state statute, as

JUSTICE BREYER:

Heritage Reporting Corporation

questions that I -- two or three brief

2

questions?

3

if you wish.

4

You answer them when you wish and

And the reason I'm asking like this is

decisions, retroactivity, all kinds of things

22

like that.

23

How do we deal with that?

Okay?

I would like to -- to -- to know the

24

answer to that.

And you've already dealt with

25

one, which is, well, I'll put it specifically:

So those numbers show that they

Companies do this every day.

Systemax, who was originally a

16

defendant in this case, no longer is a

17

defendant because overnight they simply

18

switched over.

19

When it comes to retroactivity, the

20

states don't want to address this

21

retroactively, which is why South Dakota,

22

illustrative of that, has indicated we're

23

prospective only.

24
25

In the briefing, 38 other states have
indicated their laws would prevent

Heritage Reporting Corporation

retroactivity.

And significantly -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that is

3

something that Congress could take care of if

4

we overturn Quill?

5

MR. JACKLEY:

Absolutely.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In fact -­

But in terms

7

of -- in terms of the economic impact, I mean,

8

the suggestion in some of the briefs is that

9

this is a problem that has peaked in the sense

10

that the -- the bigger e-commerce companies

11

find themselves with physical presence in -- in

12

all 50 states.

13

And the work-arounds that some of the states

14

have employed are also bringing more in.

15

So they're already covered.

And if it is, in fact, a problem that

16

is diminishing rather than expanding, why

17

doesn't that suggest that there are greater

18

significance to the arguments that we should

19

leave Quill in place?

20

MR. JACKLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice,

21

because I think it's because of e-commerce.

22

E-commerce is now 9 percent of the market, and

23

it's rapidly growing.

24
25

If you look at the numbers, it's been
challenging for the states to collect on that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

e-commerce.

2

40 -­

3

The collection rate is as low as

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sure,

4

e-commerce is expanding, and companies like

5

Amazon account for a large part of that.

6

they're already collecting in all 50 states.

7

And that's the problem.

But

It's not that

8

e-commerce is expanding.

It -- it is -- it is

9

-- from your point of view, I think, the

10

problem you have to address is that the

11

coverage in terms of collecting the taxes is

12

expanding as well.

13

MR. JACKLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice,

14

certainly, it's expanding, but what remains is

15

that $100 billion loss over the next 10 years.

23

Thank you.
Mr. Stewart.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

may it please the Court:

2

I'd like to start by making two brief

3

points about the stare decisis and the wisdom

4

of leaving this matter to Congress.

5

The first point I'd like to make is,

6

whatever this Court decides, whether it

7

overrules Bellas Hess and Quill, whether it

8

leaves those in place, whether it does

9

something in between, Congress can act.

10

Congress can impose whatever solution it

11

believes is appropriate.

12

And, indeed, if states are given

13

greater latitude to experiment in this area, to

14

devise different schemes that would balance the

15

interests of out-of-state retailers against the

16

interests of consumers within the states' brick

17

-- brick-and-mortar retailers, the states' own

18

interest in -- in acquiring funds, if states

19

can experiment, Congress will have a wider

20

variety of models to look at to decide what

21

aspects of each it would like to -- to choose.

22
23
24
25

The second thing I'd say about stare
-JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That doesn't do

anything -- that doesn't do anything for the

20
1

interim period and for the dislocation and

2

lawsuits that will -- it will engender until

3

there is a congressional settlement.

4

MR. STEWART:

I mean, the second thing

5

I would say about Quill is that Quill has come

6

to be understood to stand for the proposition

7

that an out-of-state retailer cannot be made to

8

collect state sales tax unless it has employees

9

or a physical facility within the state.

That

10

-- that's the meaning that's been attached to

11

the phrase "physical presence requirement" that

12

the Court used in Quill.

13

I think, in context, it's very clear

14

that Quill was not issuing an at least

15

inadvertent holding about the role of the

16

Internet presence in determining a company's

17

obligation to collect state sales tax.

18

The Court was dealing with Bellas

19

Hess.

20

being that, if the out-of-state retailer's only

21

contact with the taxing state was delivery of

22

goods and catalogs by mail or common carrier,

23

that was insufficient.

24
25

It summarized the Bellas Hess rule as

And then the Court used the term
"physical presence requirement," we believe, as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

shorthand for that principle.

2

was not saying anything one way or the other

3

about the role of a pervasive Internet presence

4

in establishing sufficient contacts with the

5

state to allow for the collection duty.

6

But the Court

And a rough analog might be that in

7

the past 15 years, the Court -- this Court has

8

sometimes acknowledged that its prior decisions

9

had used the word "jurisdictional" in a

10

less-than-precise manner, and the Court has

11

sometimes said statutes that we previously

12

characterized as jurisdictional are not really

13

that; they are something else.

14

And, to be sure, lower courts during

15

the interim were wary of rejecting this Court's

16

statement that a particular statute was

17

jurisdictional, even if it seemed to be

18

unthinking, but the Court, when it righted

19

itself, didn't feel obligated to go through the

20

steps of deciding whether the standards for

21

overruling a prior precedent had been

22

established.

wrong shorthand; we -- we're not wrong as to

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Stewart,

2

do -- do you believe that there is a

3

constitutional minimum so that even a company

4

-- a small business using the Internet may have

5

greater burdens than Amazon and, therefore,

6

they have a constitutional claim under your

7

position, or, under your position, can the

8

states impose the burdens on any -- any

9

micro-business, I guess is what the term has

10
11

been used?
MR. STEWART:

I think our view as to

12

the -- the correct answer, the -- the answer

13

that is most consistent with this Court's -­

14

the body of this Court's dormant Commerce

15

Clause jurisprudence is there's no

16

constitutional minimum, that if you have an

17

out-of-state retailer who is deliberately

18

selling a particular physical good within the

19

state, shipping the good into the state for

20

delivery to the customer and transfer of title,

21

that that is a sufficient basis for subjecting

22

that retailer to the tax collection obligation

23

in the same way that if that single good turned

24

out to be defective, the state could be subject

25

to the -- I'm sorry, the retailer could be

Mr. -- Mr. Stewart,

5

isn't that the very kind of question that

6

Congress would be equipped to deal with,

establishing a minimum?

8
9

MR. STEWART:

Certainly, the fact that

we don't think there's a constitutional minimum

10

doesn't mean it wouldn't be a good idea and it

11

wouldn't hinder Congress's ability to decide

12

that a minimum -- minimum should be establish

13

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But isn't that

15

essentially a reason why we should leave this

16

to Congress?

17

perspective, the choice is just binary.

18

-- it's you either have the Quill rule or you

19

don't.

20

In other words, from this Court's
It's

But Congress is capable of crafting

21

compromises and trying to figure out how to

22

balance the wide range of interests involved

23

here.

24

Now the General said Congress hasn't

25

done that, but, again, you know, Congress can

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

decide when it wants to craft a compromise and

2

when it doesn't want to craft a compromise.

3

And then Congress, if it decides it wants to

4

craft a compromise, can craft a compromise in

5

ways that we cannot.

6

MR. STEWART:

I -- I would certainly

7

agree that Congress has a broader range of

8

options available to it than does the Court and

9

an ability to devise more nuanced solutions.

10

I don't think, with respect, that it's

11

accurate to characterize the choice before the

12

Court as binary; that is, although it would not

13

be our preferred constitutional rule, it would

14

be open to the Court to say physical presence

15

in the form of employees or physical facilities

16

within the state is not an ironclad requirement

17

and yet not go as far as -- as we've advocated;

18

namely, that anything -­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

But the

one -­
MR. STEWART:

-- within the state is

And one thing that the Court

23

could do is, as it often does, say:

24

at the statute before us.

25

whether the nexus that South Dakota has

We'll look

We will decide

Heritage Reporting Corporation

constitutionally sufficient.

5

could leave for another day and for Congress

6

the question should a lesser link be sufficient

7

as well.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the Court

All right.

But,

9

look, the part that's bringing me there, which

10

I really think we can't do after reading these

11

briefs, is what they -- their side puts up a

12

certain specter which I'm sensitive to, which

13

is that we have four or maybe five giant

14

potential retailers in the country; I mean,

15

there could be a very small number selling

16

virtually anything.

18

finds it easy to enter.

fact, preserve the possibility of competition

And I don't know if it's a little or

2

entry barriers from raising too high.

3

Now that's something the Antitrust

4

Division could testify about, but they're not

5

going to testify here.

6

of problem that worries me.

7

MR. STEWART:

And so that's the kind

Well, let me say two or

8

three things about that.

The first is that the

9

GAO report said that something like 80 or 90 of

10

the 100 biggest Internet retailers are paying

11

their state sales taxes.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. STEWART:

Oh, is that it?

So it's -- it's big

14

companies, but it's not just the -- the four or

15

five biggest giants.

16

And so the question is kind of how far

17

down the line do you go?

18

company have to become in order for the -- the

19

burden of collecting state sales taxes to -- to

20

be substantial as -- as a practical matter?

21

How small does a

And, you know, our front-line answer

22

is the dormant Commerce Clause doesn't entitle

23

a fledgling business to the ability to make a

24

profit if the obligation to collect sales taxes

25

in various states pushes it from making a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

profit to -- to sustaining a loss.

2

a constitutional defect.

That's not

3

But the other thing we would say is

4

nobody on the other side is really seriously

5

contending that the South Dakota law in and of

6

itself places exorbitant burdens.

7

nobody on the other side is even contending

8

that if every state did exactly what South

9

Dakota has done, that the burdens would be

10
11

And, indeed,

exorbitant.
JUSTICE ALITO:

But the South Dakota

12

law is obviously a test case.

13

-- it was devised to present the most

14

reasonable incarnation of this scheme.

15

you have any doubt that states that are

16

tottering on the edge of insolvency and

17

municipalities which may be in even worse

18

position have a strong incentive to grab

19

everything they possibly can?

20

MR. STEWART:

You know, it was

But do

And -- and, certainly,

21

if the Court issued a decision that said

22

physical presence is no -- that adopted our -­

23

kind of our view of the correct answer that

24

said you sell -- you make one sale into the

25

state, you are obligated to collect the sales

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

tax, I have no doubt that if the Court issued

2

that ruling, many states would adopt regimes

3

that are less hospitable to retailers, unless

4

they were stopped from doing that by Congress.

5

My -- my point, though, is that there

6

are various contexts in the -- the dormant

7

Commerce Clause, particularly in determining

8

whether a state's tax is likely to cause

9

duplicative taxation, in which the Court says:

10

What if every state were to do this?

11

the burdens on interstate commerce be

12

exorbitant?

13

Wouldn't

I have my doubts that that mode of

14

analysis applies here, but even if it -- if it

15

did, what the retailers are asking for is

16

something more -- much more than that.

17

are asking for the Court to say that because,

18

if every other state adopted a regime that was

19

a much more onerous variant of what South

20

Dakota's statute does, South Dakota's statute

21

must be invalid.

22

They

There's no basis in the Court's

23

dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence for

24

holding that.

-- duplicative

6

taxation, does the government have a position

7

on the question whether retroactive application

8

of -- of this would be constitutional?

9

MR. STEWART:

In our view, it would be

10

constitutional, in -- in part because, as I was

11

saying earlier, we don't understand Quill to

12

have issued an in -- inadvertent holding with

13

respect to Internet presence.

our view, can simply clarify Quill rather than

overrule it.

16

The Court, in

But even if the Court felt that

retroactive application of the decision, the

18

collection of back taxes, raised more

substantial constitutional problems, it could

simply leave open the possibility of additional

21

Pike-type challenges to back taxes even as

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- before you

finish, what is the government's position on

the prospect of prospective overruling of

6

problem.

7

Then we would have no retroactivity

MR. STEWART:

I -- I think the Court

8

has eschewed prospective announcement of

9

constitutional rules in the following sense:

10

That is, the Court has determined, certainly

11

correctly I -- I believe, that the Court's role

12

is to interpret the Constitution, not to amend

13

it.

14

If the Court says in June of this year

15

that the dormant Commerce Clause means X, it

16

can't say that up until now the dormant

17

Commerce Clause meant something else.

18

that sense, prospective decision-making is

19

inconsistent with the judicial role.

20

And in

However, there are circumstances -­

21

and qualified immunity is one of them -- where

22

even though the newly announced constitutional

23

rule as a rule applies retroactively, the

24

types of relief may depend on whether people

MR. ISAACSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

if it please the Court:
I'd like to direct my initial

10

responses to some of the questions that Justice

11

Breyer was asking counsel.

12

fact that there were conflicting numbers before

13

the Court regarding what is the amount of lost

14

revenue that the states are experiencing, and

15

he said, what should we rely upon?

He pointed out the

The most authoritative, independent,

and extensive study was the one that was done

by the General Accountability Office, and the

General Accountability Office determined that

21

professors at the University of Tennessee,

22

which was issued in 2009 based on 2006 figures,

23

and then updated in 2012 based upon 2009

24

figures, the GAO indicated that the figures

25

were only one-quarter to one-third of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32

amount of lost revenues.

JUSTICE BREYER:

the problem really.

brief is filled with stuff.

example, go to the website, which I went to,

that they recommend, and it seems easy to

determine what the sales tax was.

The problem really is your
I mean, for

And you say:

And, moreover, there are 10,000

10

different ones, and you try to do that and you

11

get it wrong, and either the state assesses

13

billions or, you know, a lot, and -- or the

class action lawyers sue you for having paid

3

are logical.

4

Okay?

Both

How do I decide who's right?

MR. ISAACSON:

Well, part of that

5

problem, Justice Breyer, is the fact that

6

there's no record in this case.

7

trying to determine even as a matter of stare

8

decisis where there is a special justification

9

for overruling Quill, I think the problem that

And so, in

10

you've identified is that no record has been

11

presented to the Court that would support that

12

substantial justification.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how about going

14

back to the very basic issue?

15

is that asking an out-of-state seller to

16

collect tax on goods shipped in-state

17

discriminates against interstate commerce.

18

An -- assertion

But, I see it, why isn't it, far from

19

discriminating, equalizing sellers; that is,

20

anyone who wants to sell in-state, whether an

21

in-state shop, an out-of-state shop, everybody

22

is treated to the same tax collection

23

obligation.

24

are subject to the in-state tax.

25

All who exploit an in-state market

Why isn't that equalizing rather than

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

discriminating?

2

MR. ISAACSON:

Well, the -- the

3

dormant Commerce Clause takes as its principal

4

objective the maintenance of a single national

5

marketplace that is free and accessible to all

6

participants.

7

And the Court found back in the Bellas

8

Hess decision in '67 that the existence of 2300

9

different sales and use tax jurisdictions with

10

varying rates, varying exemptions, varying

11

taxability items, varying filing requirements

12

and audit obligations, was a burden on in-state

13

commerce.

14

In 1992, when Quill was decided, that

15

figure went from 2300 to 6,000.

16

today is over 12,000 different jurisdictions.

17

That figure

So the concern that the Bellas Hess

18

and Quill courts had was the notion that a free

19

and open market would be encumbered by that

20

degree of complexity.

21

only worsened over time.

22

And that complexity has

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I -- I -- I don't

23

think you've quite addressed Justice Ginsburg's

24

question, though, which is brick-and-mortar

25

retailers, if they choose to operate in any

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

given jurisdiction, have to comply with that

2

jurisdiction.

3

that have to comply with lots of different

4

jurisdictions' rules.

5

There are a lot of retailers

Why should we favor, this Court favor,

6

a particular business model that relies not on

7

brick and mortar but on mail order?

8
9

I understand in Bellas Hess the Court
was concerned about a nascent, small mail order

10

industry.

11

antiquated today.

12

Those concerns seem a little

So maybe if you could address, Justice

13

Ginsburg's question is the same one I have, so

14

anything you might say on that would be

15

helpful.

16
17

MR. ISAACSON:

Thank you, Justice

Gorsuch.

18

Borders count.

States exercise their

19

sovereignty based upon borders, territorial

20

limits.

21

federalism in this country.

22

It's a key part of horizontal

So, if there's going to be some

23

standard that determines when is a company

24

subject to the tax jurisdiction of a state,

25

using the -- the territorial limits of that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1
2

state make sense.
What I think is most significant in

3

looking at this -- this issue is that most of

4

the large retailers -- 19 of the 20 largest

5

Internet retailers already do collect tax

6

because the nature of the market has required

7

them to establish a local presence.

8

100 top Internet retailers, the collection rate

9

is between 86 and 97 percent.

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

11

it's still not responsive, counsel.

12

Among the

I accept that, but

You're -- you're -- you're just merely

13

pointing out that more Internet retailers are

14

moving toward brick and mortar.

15

again, why should this Court favor those who

16

don't over those who do?

17

Fine.

But,

MR. ISAACSON:

That's the question.
So the -- the United

18

States has suggested that even one sale into

19

the state would require collection.

20

point of sale retailer only has to comply with

21

one jurisdiction, where their store is located.

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now a

Not necessarily.
You may know the

24

answer -- you may know the answer, but, I mean,

25

with all these numbers, I mean, one part of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

answer to that in my mind or, not an answer,

2

but help resolve it, is what does it cost for a

3

mandolin seller who sells mandolins on the

4

Internet to sell them in 50 states?

5

does it cost him to enter that market?

6

How much

How much did it cost Sears, Roebuck?

7

You know, that's an ancient name, but they did

8

all right.

9

(Laughter.)

10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, by the way, how

much does it cost Amazon voluntarily to comply?

12

And I -- I mean, see, there are

13

empirical questions that I think are -- would

14

help me reach an answer.

15

tell me.

16

cost Amazon?

17

saler -- seller?

differences?

MR. ISAACSON:

I do not know what it

costs Amazon, but I do know that in the

25

Kavanagh report, which we cite in our -- in our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38

briefs to the Court, indicated that the cost of

2

just implementation and integration of a

3

software system, before you're dealing with any

4

of the other issues, costs up to $250,000.

5

That the maintenance of a system -­

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

7

at $12.

8

figure seems a little misleading.

9

We know that too.

Well, but it starts
Right?

So that

I guess the real question that I think

10

Justice Breyer is maybe getting at, and I'd

11

love your help on this too, is the comparative

12

difference.

13

Right?

After Quill, now states may force

14

Internet providers to provide information, like

15

Colorado does, that enable them to collect tax

16

from the taxpayer.

17

isn't no duty at all on the Internet supplier

18

versus collecting sales taxes.

19

like Colorado's regime versus collecting sales

20

tax.

21

So the real delta here

It's something

Do you have any information at all as

22

to which is the lesser burden?

I've wondered

23

whether the Colorado regime might be more

24

burdensome to clients like yours who do sales

25

over the Internet than just simply collecting

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

the sales tax itself.

2
3

MR. ISAACSON:

The Colorado regime is

much less burdensome.

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

5

on that?

6

us that?

7

Do you have any data

Is there anything at all that tells

MR. ISAACSON:

Well, that law has only

8

gone into effect this year.

The annual

9

reporting requirement hasn't -- hasn't arrived

10

yet.

It doesn't arrive until -- until next

11

year.

And so there -- there's no empirical

12

evidence in that regard.

13

But the reporting requirement for the

14

Colorado law simply requires a single annual

15

spreadsheet reporting of all the purchases that

16

were made by Colorado residents.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then the state

18

has the burden of going after consumers, I

19

mean, just in the real world, it's much more

20

efficient, much more likely, to yield funds if

21

you go after the seller than if you go after

22

the individual consumer.

23

MR. ISAACSON:

And I think that

24

speaks, Justice Ginsburg, to the value of a

25

congressional solution.

So, for example, what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

Congress can require is one rate per state for

2

all remote sales.

3

It can require a clearinghouse that

4

can be used for the processing of payments.

5

can require standard uniform definitions of

6

products so that food and sportswear and

I think an important part of the

10

history of this issue and correcting what I

11

think is the misimpression that's been

12

presented by the United States and the State of

13

South Dakota is that Congress has been active

14

on this issue going back to shortly after the

15

Quill decision.

16

Congress passed the Internet Tax

17

Freedom Act in 1998, which established an

18

Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce,

19

which issued a comprehensive report in 2000

20

detailing the items that the states should

21

address to simplify their tax systems in order

22

to warrant federal legislation.

23

And it called upon the states to

24

develop that system within five years.

25

2

The states did not develop that -­

3

that system.

A number of states initiated a

4

project called the Streamlined Sales Tax

5

Project to come up with such a uniform system

6

of taxation.

7

with populations having -- over -- states with

8

a population of more than two-thirds of the

9

national population refused to join, and that

And over two-thirds of the states

10

included all the larger states, like New York,

11

Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas, Florida,

12

California.

13

So that Congress has given clear

14

direction to the states, the kind of steps that

15

should be taken if they were going to be

16

MR. ISAACSON:

I understand that.

I'm certainly not

suggesting that Congress should be acting to

11

correct this Court's Quill decision.

12

this Court recognized in its Quill decision

13

that Congress had the power and was better

suited to be addressing the issue.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Rather,

But -- but the

assumption of many of these questions is that

Quill is incorrect but that that doesn't make

18

any difference.

19

does make a difference when -- when Congress

20

acts for it to determine what the

21

constitutional rule is as correctly stated by

this Court.

And I'm suggesting that it

I think that then

the standard of stare decisis is that, even

5

where the Court has ruled incorrectly, there's

6

a value in settled expectations and standing by

7

the decision previously.

8
9

And that is most powerful when
Congress has the ability to correct an error if

10

that error existed.

United States deal very lightly with the issue

12

of stare decisis.

And both the state and the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if the Court is

14

responsible for Bellas Hess, and there was from

15

the very beginning strong dissenting opinions,

16

and there was a suggestion that there be a test

responsibility to keep our case law in tune

19

with the current commercial arrangements?

21

antitrust area.

22

23

It's

Why are we -- Congress -- ask

MR. ISAACSON:

Well, first, the Quill

24

Court did not invite test case litigation on

25

the issue.

Justice Kennedy raised that issue

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

in his concurring opinion in -- in the Brohl

2

decision.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

MR. ISAACSON:

Yes.

But I think the main

5

reason, Justice Ginsburg, is because of the

6

power of stare decisis, especially on the issue

7

of reliance.

8
9

If this Court decided to overturn
Quill -- and I think Justice Alito giving the

10

-- the two alternatives, either a -- an

11

immediate overturning of Quill or -- or turning

12

to a congressional solution -- the result would

13

be chaotic.

14

It's interesting, if you take the

15

statement of Colorado's only member of the

16

House of Representatives, Katie Noem, said, "If

17

the Supreme Court rules in South Dakota's

free-for-all.

there's enough incentive in the system that if

MR. ISAACSON:

The notion of software

being a silver bullet, I -- I think, is -- is a

12

looking up of the rate for the 12,000 different

Retailers need to map their products

errors because common products are defined

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think what -­

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why is it -­

-- Justice Ginsburg

6

was perhaps suggesting was that all these

7

functions would be essentially taken over by

8

companies like Amazon and eBay and Etsy, that

9

they would do it for all the retailers on their

10
11

system.
Now there's something a little bit

12

ironic in saying the problem with Quill is that

13

it benefited all these companies, so now we're

14

going to overturn Quill so that we can benefit

15

the exact same companies.

16

But -- but I think that that's the

17

idea; that, in fact, this would not fall on

18

individual entrepreneurs, that it -- instead,

19

they would pay fees to companies like Amazon.

20

MR. ISAACSON:

The -- the problem,

21

Justice Kagan, is that a number of the

22

functions that I described simply cannot be

23

performed by software.

24

need to collect resale and other forms of

25

exemption certificates, states require that

So, for example, if you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

those be physical papers that -- that you

2

collect.

3

There's no software solution to that.
If -- if a state is coming in to audit

4

you, software doesn't solve that for you in -­

5

in -- in any respect.

6

certain functions, and those functions might

7

improve by entrepreneurial initiatives, but

8

they're not going to solve these other issues.

9

So software can do

And what will happen, because of the

10

substantial expense that's associated with

11

this, is that small and mid-sized companies

12

will be deterred from entering that market.

13

They have a choice.

14

opening a store within the state and foregoing

15

a national market, or they can develop a

16

website and sell to a national market.

They can either invest in

17

The Commerce Clause was the promise -­

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But they say if

19

they open a store within the state, then

20

they're hit by these remote -- remote sellers,

21

and so their store in the state is suffering.

22

It is the small business person inside the

23

state that's suffering.

24
25

MR. ISAACSON:

It's interesting,

Justice Ginsburg, that, currently, over

2

website.

3

estimated that 91 percent of small businesses

4

will have a website.

5

And by the end of 2018, it's

So the issue here is not between small

6

in-state retailers and out-of-state direct

7

marketers.

8

large companies, who are omni-merchants, who

9

are multi-channel merchants, who are

10

The real competition is between the

increasingly dominating the Internet.

11

And one of the effects, if you

12

increase the cost of admission, if you have

13

barriers to entry, one of the inevitable

14

effects is going to be that those small and

15

medium-sized companies are going to be deterred

16

and there will be even greater concentration by

17

the largest retailers.

18

Again, I think that is antithetical to

19

what the objectives of the Commerce Clause

20

were.

21

The arguments that the United States

22

made, I think, raise some -- some very

23

disturbing notions of what the future would -­

24

would look like.

25

The notion that Mr. Stewart presented

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

that there is no constitutional minimum if the

2

Court overturns Quill, that any single sale

3

would obligate a company to then comply with

4

the particulars of that jurisdiction's tax,

5

would really mean that you'd have most smaller

6

merchants say that's not a -- a function that

7

we can assume at an economic basis.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

But that would be

really something that would appeal to Congress

10

to fix, because the whole picture, Congress

11

doesn't want to look like it's increasing

12

taxes, but fixing something like that would not

13

encounter the same hurdle.

14

MR. ISAACSON:

The absence of any

15

incentive of the states to seek a congressional

16

resolution in the event that Quill was

17

overruled, I think, is a major impediment to

18

the notion that Congress would come in and fix

19

the problem.

20

And as Justice Sotomayor pointed out,

21

what happens in the interregnum, what happens

22

in the one- or two- or three-year period before

23

Congress acts and companies are confronted with

24

this dilemma of collection?

25

The notion of a chaotic period

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

issue is as daunting as any in terms of what

3

the consequence of overruling Quill would be.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We saw today, from

6

the announcement today, that Congress can

7

sometimes act with -- with rapidity.

8
9

MR. ISAACSON:

Well, in -- in this

instance, leading state leaders -- for example,

10

the Director of Tax Policy for the Conference

11

of State Legislatures has publicly stated that

12

if this Court were to overturn Quill, there's

13

no reason that the states would favor federal

14

legislation.

15

So that dynamic is one which I think

16

would likely stalemate Congress rather than

17

encourage Congress to act.

18

I do want to make special emphasis on

19

the issue of -- of stare decisis because, since

20

Quill has been in place, and there's been a

21

clear explanation of what the standard is for

22

tax jurisdiction, literally thousands of

23

companies have conformed their conduct to the

24

standard that was -- was established.

25

Justice Scalia's concurrence in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

Quill case said that, where that kind of

2

reliance is present and companies have ordered

3

their economic affairs in that reliance, that

4

the adoption of stare decisis is at its acme.

5

And he also pointed out that that is especially

6

so where Congress can address the issue.

7

If Congress were to address the issue,

8

I think there would be no doubt that it would

9

be purely prospective.

In fact, I think that's

10

the only thing Congress could probably do, is

11

have a prospective law.

12

But this Court has indicated that a

13

purely prospective ruling is inconsistent with

14

its view of the law and made that very clear in

15

the -- in the Harper case.

MR. ISAACSON:

24

their investment decisions based upon a

25

business model understanding what the Quill

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53

2

standard requires.

So -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the -- the

3

assumption, when you're talking about stare

4

decisis, is that the decision was wrong.

5

you're saying they've made business decisions

6

on the basis of an erroneous decision, when the

7

decision is based on the fact that -- well,

8

that use taxes are not being paid.

9
10

MR. ISAACSON:

So

Yeah, I think -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other

11

words, the benefit comes from them, not just

12

from the fact that they don't have to collect,

13

but from the fact that most people aren't

14

paying use taxes.

15

MR. ISAACSON:

I think Justice Kagan's

16

decisions in Bay Mills and in Kimble make clear

17

that the application of stare decisis is not

18

dependent upon the correctness of the decision

19

which is being followed.

20

In fact, if a decision is correct,

21

stare decisis isn't necessary.

22

would be standing on its -- on its own legs.

23

The decision

So, here, you have a situation quite

24

different than other cases where the Court has

circumstances, and that's precisely what Pike

Complete Auto is, it's -- it's a nexus such

19

that the benefits of state revenue do not

outweigh the compliance costs associated with

has imposed.

14

this issue, are telling you there are

15

significant constitutional concerns.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Oh, by the way, you do, and we've

And that has significant

15

constitutional concerns, which is why the

16

states aren't doing it and aren't likely going

17
