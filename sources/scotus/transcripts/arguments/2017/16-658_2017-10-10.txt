Mr. Herstoff.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN A. HERSTOFF

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. HERSTOFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

One of the fundamental tenets of our

13

constitutional structure is that only Congress

14

can set the jurisdiction of the lower courts.

15

Based on that fundamental principle,

16

Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5)(C)

17

is non-jurisdictional.

18

28 U.S.C. Section 2107(c) is unambiguous.

19

district court can extend the time to appeal as

20

long as a motion is timely filed and there has

21

been a showing of excusable neglect or good

22

cause.

23

The plain language of
A

No maximum extension of time is set in

24

the statute or in any other statute.

And,

25

therefore, Rule 4(a)(5)(C) does not constitute

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

4
1

a limitation on a court's jurisdiction.

2

Because of that, Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is

3

subject to forfeiture, waiver, and equitable

4

considerations.

5

several acts of forfeiture and waiver.

6

Respondents forfeited their right to rely on

7

Rule 4(a)(5)(C) by -­

8
9

And here there have been

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

Should we -- should

we reach that question, counsel?

I mean, the

10

Seventh Circuit typed this limitation as

11

jurisdictional, so they never went on to

12

consider any question of forfeiture or waiver.

13

So, are you suggesting that we should decide

14

those questions in the first instance?

15

MR. HERSTOFF:

I submit that the

16

record is sufficiently clear that the Court can

17

-- can reach that issue here.

18

Court has discretion just to have it considered

19

on remand, but we do think that the forfeitures

20

and waivers are clear here.

21

Certainly, the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The issues of

22

equitable considerations, special circumstances

23

that you talk about, are there limits to those?

24

I mean, let's say the issue comes up three

25

years later.

Can the district court at that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

5
1

point consider to extend the time to appeal?

2

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, certainly, the

3

equities would have to be weighed.

4

the longer -- the longer the extension is,

5

perhaps the less reasonable it is for an

6

appellant to rely on the district court's

7

order, but assuming that a -- an order is

8

relied on in good faith by the appellant,

9

there's been no objection from the other side,

10

there's been no showing of bad faith, we think

11

that the equities should be considered.

12

here it's undisputed that Ms. Hamer was misled

13

by the district court's order.

14

Certainly,

And

There's absolutely no showing of bad

15

faith here.

16

recognized that Ms. Hamer was misled.

17

under those circumstances, we think that

18

equitable considerations should require that

19

the appeal be decided on the merits.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

misled her?

22

attorney?

The Seventh Circuit itself

But -- but who

Was it the court or was it her own

23

MR. HERSTOFF:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

And

Well -­
Was this

malpractice on the attorney's part for asking

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

6
1

for an extension that exceeded the Federal

2

Rules?

3

the statute is -- that you're right, that this

4

is a non-jurisdictional barrier, it would still

5

be a statutory barrier, a Federal Rules

6

barrier.

7

Assuming it's non-jurisdictional, that

MR. HERSTOFF:

Yes, and we then -- we

8

think that Ms. Hamer was misled by the district

9

court's order.

It's certainly true that she

10

may have also been misled by the attorney's

11

motion for the extension of time.

12

both of those factored in here, and the

13

equities should be considered.

14

There -­

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- but

That was an

16

attorney who simultaneously was asking to be

17

relieved from representing her, right?

18

MR. HERSTOFF:

That's correct, Justice

19

Ginsburg, yes.

And that -- this case is

20

directly analogous to Harris Truck Lines.

21

Harris Truck Lines, the attorney asked for an

22

extension of time that was prohibited, both by

23

rule and by statute, and yet this Court held

24

that the -- the reliance on the extension of

25

time required that the equities be considered

Heritage Reporting Corporation

In

Official

7
1

and required that the appeal be decided on the

2

merits.

3

should be followed.

And we submit here the same course

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As a matter of

5

custom and usage in the district courts, could

6

you just tell me -- suppose the verdict is

7

returned or the judge indicates it's what the

8

-- what the ruling will be -- can both sides

9

and do both sides sometimes say please don't

10

enter the judgment, Your Honor, so that we can

11

talk settlement?

12

Does that happen?

MR. HERSTOFF:

So do the parties ask

13

that the district court withhold -­

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, in other words,

15

both -- both parties tell -- in order to avoid

16

these problems, say please don't enter

17

judgment.

18

MR. HERSTOFF:

19

certainly can happen.

20

case -­

21
22
23

Yeah, and that
In this particular

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does it happen?

I

was curious to know.
MR. HERSTOFF:

I have certainly seen

24

some instances where a court comes out with a

25

decision and then asks the parties to submit a

proposed form of judgment.

So, that could

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My -- my question

was a little different.

7

Honor, we're in settlement negotiations, could

8

you please withhold entry of judgment?

9

MR. HERSTOFF:

Could they say, Your

I'm not sure that I've

10

seen that specific scenario, especially in the

11

summary judgment context where the motion was

12

pending.

13

judgment motions are pending and the parties

14

ask the court not to issue a decision at all.

15

What I have seen is where summary

I'm not sure I've seen a situation

16

where a decision is out and the parties have

17

asked the court to withhold -­

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could the parties in

19

the district court agree to withhold entry of

20

judgment for -- for -- for years and,

21

therefore, prejudice the Court of Appeals when

22

ultimately it has a case that -- that's old?

23

MR. HERSTOFF:

For years, no, because

24

Rule 58 of the Rules of Civil Procedure says

25

that the judgment is considered to be entered

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

if -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
something like that?

4
5

It's 180 days or

MR. HERSTOFF:

It -- yes, Justice

Kennedy.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MR. HERSTOFF:

Right.

So -- but outside of

8

that, I don't -- I don't see any barrier to the

9

parties asking the Court to do that.

10

Although

I -­

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We have one brief,

12

an amicus brief in this case, telling us that

13

we were wrong in drawing a distinction between

14

what's in a statute, jurisdictional, what's in

15

the rule, non-jurisdictional.

16

And instead, anything that shifts a

17

case from one court to the other, as notice of

18

appeal does, that should be considered

19

jurisdictional.

20

brief.

21

This is Professor Dodson's

MR. HERSTOFF:

Yes.

And I

22

respectfully disagree with that for a couple of

23

reasons.

24
25

That formulation of jurisdiction is
inconsistent with this Court's case law and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

10
1
2

also with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
For instance, under Professor Dodson's

3

formulation of jurisdiction, the time to -- to

4

appeal from the VA to the Court of Appeals for

5

veterans' claims would be jurisdictional

6

because it involves the transfer of

7

adjudicatory authority, yet this Court

8

unanimously held that that time period is

9

non-jurisdictional.

10

Similarly, the Federal Rules of Civil

11

Procedure, such as Rules 54(b) and 23(f), would

12

be jurisdictional under Professor Dodson's

13

formulation, but we know from Rule 82 that the

14

Rules of Civil Procedure are

15

non-jurisdictional.

16
17
18

So, therefore, Professor Dodson's
formulation of jurisdiction is incorrect.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think a rule

19

can ever be jurisdictional without being

20

codified in a statute?

21

MR. HERSTOFF:

22

statute, no.

23

jurisdictional.

24
25

A rule that is not in a

I think that it cannot be

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's a flat

rule, there are no exceptions to it?

What if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

11
1

the rule, for example, interpreted statutory

2

language?

3

MR. HERSTOFF:

If the rule interpreted

4

statutory language, then perhaps under that

5

interpretation of the statute, the statute

6

could be jurisdictional.

7

own could never be jurisdictional.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MR. HERSTOFF:

But the rule on its

And why is that?
It stems from a long

10

line of this Court's cases, such as Kontrick,

11

and it also stems from Article III of the

12

Constitution, which says that it's for Congress

13

to establish the lower courts.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -­

We have drawn the

15

line, I think it was in Justice Thomas's

16

decision, between statute and rule pretty

17

clearly.

18

MR. HERSTOFF:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg,

19

Bowles versus Russell establishes that and

20

Kontrick versus Ryan establishes it, and cases

21

as far back as the 1940s and perhaps even

22

earlier have also said that court-promulgated

23

rules cannot be jurisdictional.

24

that the same course should be followed here.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, we think

The -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

12
1

rule by its terms, I suppose, it says you've

2

got to file the motion no later than 30 days

3

after the time proscribed under Rule 4(a),

4

right?

5
6

MR. HERSTOFF:

That's right, Mr. Chief

Justice.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But then it's

8

quite clear that that's not jurisdictional,

9

right?

10

MR. HERSTOFF:

11

jurisdictional, yes, Your Honor.

12

Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I'm

13

talking about the time to file the motion for

14

an extension.

15

MR. HERSTOFF:

Oh, I'm sorry, the time

16

to file, yes, under Bowles, that probably would

17

be jurisdictional because it's right in the

18

statute as well.

19

So the first sentence of Section

20

2107(c) sets the time to file the motion.

21

think under Bowles that would likely be

22

jurisdictional.

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I

The motion for

an extension?
MR. HERSTOFF:

The -- the time to file

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

13
1

the motion, yes, that would be jurisdictional,

2

whereas the length of the extension would not

3

be, and would, therefore, be subject to -­

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you make of

5

the argument that at one time it was in the

6

statute and it was left out inadvertently?

7

MR. HERSTOFF:

They respectfully

8

disagree with that.

I think the plain language

9

of the statute is very clear, and this Court

10

presumes that Congress intends its amendments

11

to have effect.

12

And aside from that, the legislative

13

history shows that Congress knew exactly which

14

limitations it was incorporating into the

15

statute.

16

Specifically, the House report says

17

that it is incorporating the first sentence of

18

Rule 4(a)(5) into the statute, which -- which

19

is the time to file the motion and the

20

requirement that there be excusable neglect or

21

good cause.

22

That was being incorporated, whereas

23

the entirety of Rule 4(a)(6) was being

24

incorporated.

25

specific decision which parts to incorporate

So, certainly Congress made a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

14
1

and which parts not to incorporate.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they

3

also said these were only technical changes,

4

right?

5

MR. HERSTOFF:

That -- that was said.

6

However, a comparison between the old statute

7

and the new statute shows that very significant

8

changes were made.

9

permitted an extension of time if there was

10

The older statute only

excusable neglect, plus a lack of notice.

11

Here, there can be an extension of

12

time under the 1991 statute if there's any

13

showing of excusable neglect or if there's any

14

showing of good cause.

15

Additionally, the statute in the

16

second part of 2107(c) permits a reopening of

17

the appeal time if there's a showing of lack of

18

notice, even if there's no excusable neglect.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the part

20

that was carried over the time limit in the

21

case where the would be appellant didn't

22

receive timely -- didn't receive notice of the

23

judgment, that the judgment had been entered?

24
25

MR. HERSTOFF:
right.

Yes, Your Honor, that's

But excusable neglect was not required

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

15
1
2

there, whereas it was under the old statute.
So certainly the 1991 statute was -­

3

is much more permissive toward extensions of

4

time than the old statute and really the new

5

statute codified what had been in the federal

6

rules since the 1960s.

7
8
9

So, certainly the 1991 statute made
very significant changes.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think there is

10

anything that would bar the rules of appellate

11

procedure from altering doctrines like

12

forfeiture, waiver, and exceptional

13

circumstances?

14

MR. HERSTOFF:

I think that certainly

15

is possible for the rules to do that.

16

think it was done here, but -- but yes.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't

Well, this is -­

18

assuming it's not jurisdictional, it is a

19

mandatory claims processing rule.

20

MR. HERSTOFF:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, Your Honor.
And it -- it comes -­

22

it follows from a version of the statute that

23

did impose a hard time limit, did it not?

24

MR. HERSTOFF:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I would -­
The prior version of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

16
1

the statute had a time limit.

2

MR. HERSTOFF:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

It did, yes.
And there's at least

4

some question whether Congress really intended

5

to eliminate that or whether it was done

6

inadvertently or whether it was done on the

7

assumption that a time limit in the rules would

8

also be jurisdictional, as this Court had

9

suggested in some earlier cases.

10

MR. HERSTOFF:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

Well -­
Is all of that -- is

any of that untrue?

13

MR. HERSTOFF:

I would -- I would

14

disagree that there's any evidence that the

15

omission was -- was inadvertent.

16

true that the old statute did have a 30-day

17

time limit on extensions, the conditions to get

18

that 30-day extension were much different from

Although it's

23

requirement.

You could get an extension if you

5

MR. HERSTOFF:

Isn't that

Under the old statute,

6

there was a requirement that there be a lack of

7

notice, plus excusable neglect.

8

those conditions had to be met in order for

9

there to be an extension of time, whereas here

So both of

10

there's a provision for an extension of time

There's a separate provision for an

new, that was not in the original?

18

20

And that's what's

MR. HERSTOFF:

Yes, Your Honor, that's

correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, given that this

21

is a mandatory claims processing rule, and you

22

said that you didn't think there was anything

23

that would prevent the rules from altering

24

doctrines like forfeiture and waiver, would it

25

be within the discretion of a Court of Appeals

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

18
1

to say that we are going to treat this rule,

2

even though it's not jurisdictional, in some

3

respects as if it were jurisdictional, so that,

4

for example, we will sua sponte raise the

5

question of timeliness under the rule?

6

MR. HERSTOFF:

I think that would be

7

inconsistent with this Court's case law, which

8

says that -- that forfeited issues should not

9

be raised sua sponte unless there are

10

exceptional circumstances.

11

circumstances," I think, was the terminology

12

that was used.

13

"Extraordinary

And then here there are no such

14

extraordinary circumstances that would -- that

15

would allow a Court of Appeals to address this

18

consistent with your answer that you -- that

that doctrine could be changed via a rule?

appeals interpret the rule as changing the

3

teeth in the concept of mandatory.

4
5

After all, it is a mandatory

MR. HERSTOFF:

There has to be some

I think there -- there

certainly are teeth here.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If there's -­
It means if you

7

raise it, it's mandatory.

But a mandatory

8

claim-processing rule can be waived, so that's

9

the difference.

What's mandatory is if the

10

point is made, then the -- the mandatory rule

11

applies.

12

opposing party doesn't -- doesn't range -­

13

raise it, it can be waived.

14

But if a defendant doesn't or a

MR. HERSTOFF:

Yes, Your Honor.

That

15

-- that's my understanding.

And what I -- what

16

I understood Justice Alito's question to be was

17

whether, by rule -- a federal rule could say

18

that -- that there's no forfeiture or waiver

19

allowed, that we don't consider forfeiture or

20

waiver.

21

-- that was not done here with Rule 4(a)(5)(C).

Certainly, that's possible, but that

22

And certainly, this Court has long

23

interpreted the Federal Rules to facilitate

24

disposition of cases on their merits.

25

example, in Surowitz, the Court said that.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

For
In

Official

20
1

Foman versus Davis, the Court held that an

2

appeal had to proceed despite the fact that

3

there was a defect in the notice of appeal.

4

there's been a long history of the Federal

5

Rules being interpreted to maximize the

6

resolution of cases on their merits, and we

7

submit that Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is no different.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So

But -- but if a

court were by rule to say no waiver, no

effect, as declaring the rule jurisdictional.

Alito's question was that hypothetically, if

provision, whether that would be permissible.

22

We'd have to look certainly to see if that

would be consistent with the Rules Enabling

25

rule would be consistent with that.

It's also for the

Ah, well, if it's at

10

why is the court stuck with whatever the

appellee does on the issue of forfeiture?

12

If the appellee is asleep and this

rule was supposed at least in part to protect

the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, why

15

can't the court of appeals put some teeth in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAMIEN G. STEWART

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

6

There's one fact that's undisputed in

7

this case, and that is that Ms. Hamer filed her

8

notice of appeal outside of the 30-day

9

limitation that's set forth within Rule 4.

10

And there are two approaches that the

11

Court can take in this situation.

12

route taken by the Seventh Circuit below, which

13

held that Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is jurisdictional.

14

And, alternatively, the Court can do what it

15

did the last term in the Manrique case and

16

decline to rule on the jurisdictional issue and

17

instead find that, at minimum, this is a

18

mandatory claims-processing rule, that the

19

Respondents timely raised the issue in

20

pre-merits briefing to the Seventh Circuit, and

21

that the district court was -­

problem.

counsel.

The defendant is well aware of that

2

time extension and, if the defendant had read

3

the rules, would recognize that they say 30

4

days, not 60 days.

5

defendant could deliberately say nothing and

6

then, on appeal, when it's too late for the

7

district court to correct the error, say,

8

sorry, mandatory, and under your rules, Court

9

of Appeals, I don't waive anything.

10

But on your view, the

It's -- it allows the defendant to
create a trap.

12

MR. STEWART:

That certainly isn't

13

what happened in this case, Judge -- Justice

14

Ginsburg.

15

And what I think the Petitioner's

16

argument, that in -- in the question that

17

you're interposing, it -- it ignores sort of

18

the realities of litigation.

19

What -- there are certain occasions in

20

a litigation where -- generally, we're all

21

familiar with the rules, but there are certain

22

occasions in litigation where you focus more

23

clearly on the rules.

24

usually occur when there's something to do,

25

when there is something obligating us to do

And those instances

something.

2

For instance, if we had to respond -­

3

if Petitioner's counsel, former counsel, had

conferred with us, then we would have looked at

6

determine whether -- what is -- what is the

rule?

something.

gives the Court the power to decide whether

16

MR. STEWART:

It does.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It does.

All right.

So the

18

fact that you made these statements didn't

notify the Seventh Circuit that you had not

21

MR. STEWART:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why didn't you

forfeit it by making the statement?
MR. STEWART:

Because the Seventh

In the Seventh -­

the docketing statements are not binding.

2

They -- the rules, they specifically

3

spell out that if there are any inaccuracies,

4

any mistakes made in the docketing statement,

5

the Court will look at that docketing statement

6

and require the parties to correct it, which is

7

-- which is exactly what happened in this case.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, I don't

know that correction -- what correction means,

10

when that may be a reason for us to remand this

11

issue to the circuit.

12

MR. STEWART:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right, right.
But I take

14

correction to mean there's an error in the

15

record, not an error in my concessions.

MR. STEWART:

So there was -- we made

-- we -- we made a mistake in describing that

18

the Petitioner had filed their notice of appeal

19

20

She didn't.

The Seventh Circuit required us to

to you to raise it, not up to the Court of

jurisprudence from Kontrick, Eberhart and

16

the -- the issue that the violation of a

mandatory claims processing rule is timely when

19

it's raised at the initial brief in the Circuit

21

it in pre-merits briefing to the circuit.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We raised

And where -- I know

23

that's a Seventh Circuit rule that you can

24

raise it before the brief -- anytime before the

the rule?

2

MR. STEWART:

case.

5

untimeliness of the notice of appeal in merits

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Stewart, do I

8

understand you to no longer be relying on the

9

argument that this is a jurisdictional rule?

10

MR. STEWART:

11

this is a jurisdictional rule.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, we do believe that

Because you've been

13

standing up there for a while now making

14

arguments that would be true if it weren't a

15

jurisdictional rule.

16

MR. STEWART:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

Right.

I mean, so which is

18

it?

Do you think that this is a jurisdictional

19

-- that this is a jurisdictional rule or that

20

it wasn't but still we should accept what the

21

Seventh Circuit did?

22

MR. STEWART:

So our argument is that

23

this is -- this is a jurisdictional rule.

24

because of that, you don't consider any of the

25

equities.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official

32
1

But in the alternative, if this Court

2

declines to determine that this rule is still

3

jurisdictional, at minimum, it is a mandatory

4

claims processing rule and that the petition

5

should be dismissed on that basis.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think what

7

Justice Ginsburg said a while ago is that when

8

we have used that term in the past, what we've

9

meant is that it's -- it's a -- it's a

10

mandatory claims processing rule that you have

11

to follow unless the party, the other party

12

forfeits the issue -­

13

MR. STEWART:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There was no -­
-- or unless there's a

15

very good reason, you know, there's some kind

16

of extra special excuse that you have.

17

MR. STEWART:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.
But, you know, where

19

there is a forfeiture and where the -- that's

20

the end of the matter, you can call it a

21

mandatory claims processing rule or not, but

22

you forfeited it.

23

MR. STEWART:

So this -- we believe

24

that the rule is jurisdictional because it has

25

a statutory basis.

Rule 4(a)(5)(C), the 30-day

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

33
1

limitation that is contained in Rule 4(a)(5)(C)

2

was present in the rule and the statute when

3

the rule was promulgated.

4

And although the 30-day, the specific

5

limiting language of 30 days is no longer in

6

the statute, we do not believe that there was

7

any intention by Congress to strip the rule of

8

the jurisdictional nature that it enjoyed for

9

decades.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it was never in

11

the statute with respect to a case like this.

12

The only provision in the statute was when

13

there was a failure to get notice of the entry

14

of judgment.

15

There was nothing in the statute

16

covering a case where there was a reason other

17

than failure -- just the statute was blank on

18

that.

19
20
21

It's no longer blank.

It gives

permission for an extension.
MR. STEWART:

But the way the pre-1991

22

statute read, it provided the district courts

23

authority to extend the time to file a notice

24

of appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect.

25

Now, it's true, there was only one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

34
1

condition that Congress deemed to constitute

2

excusable neglect in the prior-1991 statute,

3

and that was if a party did not receive notice.

4

But the idea and the concept that the

5

30-day -- that a 30-day limitation was premised

6

on a showing of excusable neglect still remains

7

in the statute today.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did excusable -­

well, what was the text of the statute?

I

10

thought it was clear that it only applied in

the case of a failure to receive notice of the

entry of judgment.

MR. STEWART:

I'll read the text to

you, Your Honor.

15

Heritage Reporting Corporation

the rule did morph over time and evolve to take

2

into account other things, good cause, for

3

instance, and eventually Rule 4(a)(6) came into

being, which is what the 1991 amendments were

5

conforming thereto.

6

But there is no evidence that any

7

member of Congress ever criticized the 30-day

8

limitation in Rule 4(a) -- 4(a)(5) -­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you disagree

10

with the D.C. -- when this issue was before the

11

D.C. Circuit, the D.C. Circuit says the 30-day

12

limit on extension appears nowhere in the U.S.

have said so.

16

legislative history that suggests Congress

17

intended to do that.

18

And there's nothing in this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, there is a

19

problem with that because it did change the

20

rule fundamentally when it permitted the

21

opening of a judgment for six months, if you

22

didn't receive notice of it.

23

radical change from the norm.

24
25

That's a fairly

And so why would it be inappropriate
to assume that Congress intended for a district

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

37
1

court to exercise its discretion and judgment

2

in deciding how much was a reasonable time for

3

excusable neglect or for good cause?

4

MR. STEWART:

So you look at the

5

inconsistency that was established then, right?

6

If a party -- a district court could extend the

7

time up to 14 days once a party, who never

8

received notice of the final order, the

9

district court could extend the time to file

10
11

that notice of appeal for 14 days.
Under the Petitioner's theory, if the

12

30-day limitation was removed, the district

13

court would have the authority to extend the

14

time to file a notice of appeal, as the Chief

15

Justice articulated, up to three years, a year.

16

There is no limitation.

There's no

17

limitation in the statute.

18

is why we believe Congress never intended to

19

remove it.

limitation.

That inconsistency

Well, there is a

It has to be for good cause.

22

MR. STEWART:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

it's self-limiting in -- in that way.

25

MR. STEWART:

Right, for good cause.
It has teeth.

So

It -- it is, Your Honor,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

38
1

but it is -- it is at best, it is ambiguous.

2

And that's why we believe that history can

3

inform this.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So suppose there is a

5

congressional statute which does set forth a

6

jurisdictional rule, and Congress wakes up one

7

day and decides, you know what, we don't think

8

that this rule should be jurisdictional

9

anymore.

10

How does it change that?

11

MR. STEWART:

12

Through legislation

Congress can change any -- any statute.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

So Congress

14

would presumably pass a piece of legislation

15

which no longer included the rule, right?

16

MR. STEWART:

They could, but you

17

would think that they would have done so,

18

especially in a situation like this where -­

21

do you expect Congress to do if it changes its

mind?

And there's another

6

Circuit split on that question in two very fine

7

opinions, one by Judge Hartz and another by

8

Judge Sutton disagreeing over that.

9

Can you tell me why you don't think

10

you needed to file an appeal yourself if you

11

wished to challenge a district court order -­

12

MR. STEWART:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

14

Sure.
-- given that's the

normal course?

15

MR. STEWART:

Sure, Judge Gorsuch.

16

This Court, in the Jennings case,

17

described the instances where an appellee would

18

be required to file a cross-appeal, and there

19

are two instances.

20

One, if the appellee is seeking to

21

enlarge its own rights.

We weren't doing that

22

here because we won the case at summary

23

judgment.

24

The other instance would be if you're

25

seeking to lessen the rights of the appellant,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

41
1

and we were not doing that either.

2

extent Ms. Hamer -­

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

To the

Well, isn't that

4

exactly what you wanted to do, is lessen the

5

rights of the appellant by kicking the

6

appellant out of court?

7

MR. STEWART:

To the extent Ms. Hamer

8

had any right, it was limited to the initial 30

9

days under Rule 4(a)(1).

10
11

She would have filed

her notice to proceed.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

She would argue, I

12

think, just to put her argument in the best

13

light and let you respond to it is I -- I

14

obtained this additional right from the

15

district court of an extension of time, which

16

allowed me to pursue this appeal in -- in the

17

Court of Appeals.

18

And Judge Sutton would say that is an

19

extension of a new right by the district court

20

that you wish to extinguish and, therefore,

21

need a notice of appeal.

22

reasoning he follows.

That's the line of

23

What's -- what's wrong with that?

24

MR. STEWART:

25

So the problem with that

reasoning is that the district court providing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

42
1

the additional time gave her some right.

2

district court didn't have the authority in the

3

first place to give that time.

4

because of Rule 4 and Rule 26.

5

The

And that's

Rule 4 says that a party has 30 days

6

to file a notice of appeal.

Rule 4(a)(5)(C)

7

allows the district court to extend that period

8

to an additional 30 days but no more.

9

26 says that courts have the authority to

And Rule

10

extend the time to comply with the rules, with

11

the exception of Rule 4.

12

So there was no opportunity for the

13

district court to provide any further days,

14

other than what is set forth in Rule 4.

15

Court didn't have the authority to give her the

16

time that it did.

17

right to file the notice of appeal when she

18

did.

So the

Ms. Hamer didn't have a

That's why it's mandatory.

19

If there are no further questions.

Thank you,

Mr. Herstoff, 10 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN A. HERSTOFF
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HERSTOFF:

Thank you.

Just a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

43
1

couple of quick points.

2

Regarding, on the Kontrick and the

3

argument that there's no forfeiture if the

4

issue is raised in the merits brief, that

5

argument rests on a misreading of Kontrick.

6

Kontrick held that there was a

7

forfeiture where, among other things, the issue

8

had not been raised in the brief.

9

not say that anytime it is raised in the merits

10

Kontrick did

brief, then there's no forfeiture.

11

Similarly, in Manrique, there was -­

12

it was held that there was no forfeiture, but

13

there the first possible opportunity to address

14

the -- the issue was in the merits brief

15

because the appellee there had no idea what the

16

appellant was going to raise in their opening

17

brief.

18
19

JUSTICE ALITO:

At what point in time

do you think the issue was -- was waived?

20

MR. HERSTOFF:

I think the issue was

21

-- was waived when -- when they said in the

22

docketing statement twice that the appeal was

23

timely.

24
25

I think -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

So not before that?

Nothing that occurred in the district court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

44
1

waived the -­

2

MR. HERSTOFF:

3

waiver, no.

4

though.

5
6

For -- for affirmative

There was certainly forfeiture,

JUSTICE ALITO:

When was it -- when

was it forfeited?

7

MR. HERSTOFF:

It was forfeited no

8

later than 30 days after the district court

9

granted the extension of time.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it wasn't forfeited

11

on the day when the district court entered the

12

order.

13
14
15

MR. HERSTOFF:

No, no, no, Your Honor,

I'm not arguing that.
JUSTICE ALITO:

It was -- because you

16

-- the order didn't preclude the filing of the

17

notice of appeal prior to the expiration of the

18

time in the order.

19

MR. HERSTOFF:

That's right.

And

20

we're certainly not arguing that there was a

21

forfeiture based upon the -- the one-day -- the

22

one-day period between the filing of the motion

23

and the granting of the motion.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

So you -- so you think

that the appellee had on pain of forfeiture,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

45
1

they had an obligation to inform the other side

2

and the court just prior to the running out of

3

the time, you know, you're going to run -­

4

you're going to have a problem here under the

5

rule if you don't file your notice of appeal

6

right away?

7

that?

8
9

They had that obligation to do

MR. HERSTOFF:

They did have an

obligation to do that if they wanted Rule

10

4(a)(5)(C) to be enforced.

11

by not appealing or cross-appealing and

12

didn't -- just wanted to address -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

They also forfeited

How is that consistent

14

with the adversary system?

15

the other side -- the -- did she have an

16

attorney at that point?

17

MR. HERSTOFF:

I mean, this isn't

No, she was pro se then

18

at the time that the district court granted the

19

motion for extension of time because the

20

district court granted that along with the

21

motion for withdrawal, so Ms. Hamer proceeded

22

pro se from then on.

23

And so the appellees, the Respondents

24

here, forfeited their right to rely on Rule

25

4(a)(5)(C) by not objecting to the extension.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

46
1

They also, to go to Justice Gorsuch's point,

2

forfeited by failing to appeal or cross-appeal.

3

The Respondents argued that -- that

4

their -- their rights were not being enlarged

5

because they got everything that they wanted

6

from the district court summary judgment order.

7

However, that focuses on the wrong order from

8

the district court.

9

The order granting the extension of

10

time said that she had two months to extend -­

11

to file the notice of appeal, two months extra.

12

And here the Respondents are seeking, in

13

essence, a reversal of the district court's

14

order granting the extension of time and an

15

order, or decision saying that she was not

16

entitled to that extension of time.

17

That is -­

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Order from which the

19

appeal -- the order from which the appeal had

20

to be taken was summary judgment for the

21

defendant.

22
23
24
25

That's the judgment, right?

MR. HERSTOFF:

That's the district

court's judgment on the merits, yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:

And the appellee wants

an affirmance of that judgment?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

47
1
2

MR. HERSTOFF:

Yeah.

Yes, they do.

But by -­

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that could be

4

affirmed on the grounds that summary judgment

5

was proper.

6

ground that the -- the notice of appeal was

7

untimely.

8
9

It could also be affirmed on the

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, I respectfully

submit that in the latter case it would not be

10

an affirmance.

11

the appeal.

12

Respondents are seeking is not an affirmance.

13

It would just be a dismissal of

So what the -- what the

They're seeking an order and judgment

14

from the appellate court saying that the

15

district court's judgment is completely

16

insulated from appellate review.

17

And in order for the appellate court

18

to do that, they would need to reverse the

19

district court's order granting the extension

20

of time, so -­

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that -­

22

that doesn't seem right to me.

I mean, the

23

relief they want is that they can't be sued,

24

right, or they win.

25

which they get to that objective makes -­

To say that the ground on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

48
1

requires a cross-appeal, I don't think that's

2

right.

3

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, I respectfully

4

submit that the -- what the Respondents are

5

seeking to do is to dismiss the appeal.

6

what they're seeking from the Seventh Circuit

7

is not any kind of decision at all about

8

whether the district court's judgment was

9

correct.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So

Well, I don't

11

think they care whether they -- the Seventh

12

Circuit says you win or they say that your

13

opponent's appeal is dismissed.

14

MR. HERSTOFF:

15

not -- might not care, I agree.

16

that.

17

appeal dismissed, that's lessening Ms. Hamer's

18

rights because without -- without the

19

Respondents' objecting to the extension of

20

time, Ms. Hamer's granted the right to

21

appellate review, which is usually what any

22

appellant has, is the right to appeal a

23

district court's judgment.

They certainly might
I agree with

However, if they're trying to get the

24

The Respondents -­

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Every time the party

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

49
1

that wins in the district court wins on the

2

merits in the district court, also thinks that

3

it has a jurisdictional argument, they have to

4

file a cross-appeal.

5

MR. HERSTOFF:

A jurisdictional

6

argument, no, because the jurisdiction can be

7

raised -­

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MR HERSTOFF:

10

All right.

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- at any -­
A -- a -- a mandatory

11

claims processing argument, they have to file a

12

cross-appeal?

13

MR. HERSTOFF:

If they're -- yeah, if

14

they're seeking to alter what the district

15

court did, in other words, if they're trying to

16

get the appellate court to rule that the

17

district court was wrong in -- in the way that

18

they applied the claim processing rule, then -­

19

then, yes, an appeal -- cross-appeal would be

20

required.

21

If there are no further questions.

We

22

respectfully request that the Court reverse the

23

Seventh Circuit's judgment and remand for

24

consideration of Ms. Hamer's appeal on the

25

merits.
