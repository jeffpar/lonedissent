Mr. Francisco.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NOEL J. FRANCISCO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
After a worldwide multi-agency review,

13

the President's acting Homeland Security

14

Secretary recommended that he adopt entry

15

restrictions on countries that failed to

16

provide the minimum baseline of information

17

needed to vet their nationals.

18

The proclamation adopts those

19

recommendations.

It omits the vast majority of

20

the world, including the vast majority of the

21

Muslim world, because they met the baseline.

22

It now applies to only seven countries that

23

fall below that baseline or had other problems,

24

and it exerts diplomatic pressure on those

25

countries to provide the needed information and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

to protect the country until they do.

2

The proclamation reflects a foreign

3

policy and national security judgment that

4

falls well within the President's power under

5

1182(f) and has been successful, which is why

6

the country of Chad was recently dropped from

7

the list.

8
9

But it -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

mentioned 1182(f).

You -- you

And the worrisome thing

10

about this is that the President acts; Congress

11

is the one responsible for making the laws

12

about immigration.

13

one of the briefs that we read 1182(f) to allow

14

the President to suspend entry but only for a

15

period of time long enough for Congress to say

16

yea or nay.

17

It has been suggested in

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, yes,

18

1182(f) is a broad and flexible power in a

19

narrow area.

20

don't need to explore those outer limits

21

because the proclamation's meant to help

22

implement the INA by making sure that we have

23

the minimum level of information needed to

24

determine if aliens are admissible under the

25

INA.

Here, however, I think that you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

In terms of a time limit, I think

3

statute and inconsistent with virtually every

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Here, we

I'm sorry, Mr. -­

7

General.

I thought that Congress had looked at

8

the situation and created a statutory system

9

that addressed the very concern the President

10

is expressing.

11

waivers if you -- if you can meet the three

12

criteria that this special committee of the

13

President looked at, and if you don't, you have

14

to have a very heightened, extreme vetting

15

process.

16

and suggested its parameters.

17

Congress said you can have visa

And it created that vetting process

More importantly, it took terrorist

18

countries and designated which ones supported

19

terrorism and added another layer of review and

20

said, if you're a national from one of those

21

countries or you have visited one of those

22

countries in the recent past, you also have to

23

get the permission of the Attorney General and

24

the Secretary of State to -- to affirm that you

25

are not a danger to the U.S.

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So I -- but what I

3

see the President doing here is saying, I'm

4

going to add more to the limits that Congress

-- and to what

Congress said was enough.

Where does a

Congress has already decided is adequate?

11

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, there are -­

12

there's a lot packed into your question, Your

13

Honor, and so let me try to unpack it a little

14

bit.

15

I think the basic answer is that

16

1182(f) gives the President the authority to

17

impose restrictions in addition to those set

18

forth in the INA, but to go to the statutes

19

that Your Honor was -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -- it might,

22

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right, but -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- on the very

21

24
25

but -­

grounds that Congress has already looked at?
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And that's exactly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

what I was going to address next, Your Honor.

2

The Visa Waiver Program provides a special

3

benefit to our closest allies and some of the

4

safest countries in the world.

5

Visa Waiver Program nor any of the other

6

statutes that they cite addresses whether we

7

get the minimum level of information needed to

8

determine the admissibility of individuals

9

coming in from some of the riskiest countries

10
11

Neither the

in the world.
And 1182(f) then does give the

12

President the authority to supplement that

13

vetting system.

14

system is essentially determined by the

15

executive branch.

16

branch to set it up.

17

branch to maintain it.

18

executive branch to constantly improve it.

19

After all, the whole vetting

It's up to the executive
It's up to the executive
And it's up to the

And, here, you have something that

20

really is at the core of 1182(f) since its main

21

purpose is to help implement the INA by making

22

sure we have that minimum baseline of

23

information.

24

And if you look at the proclamation,

25

what we're talking about is very basic pieces

of information.

real-time basis?

6

Not the ideal, but the

Are they reporting terrorism history
Are they reporting criminal

Do they cooperate with us on a

And I could give you an example to

7

help illustrate how this works.

Suppose that

8

Jane Doe shows up at our border with a valid

9

visa, but after that visa was issued, pursuant

10

to the entire process, Your Honor, that you

11

described, her home country learns that she is

12

associated with a terrorist organization but

13

doesn't tell us.

14

Once she shows up at the border, we

15

cannot make an intelligent determination as to

16

whether or not she's admissible under the INA.

17

And that's what this proclamation really does

18

go to:

19

baseline of information needed to determine

20

admissibility.

21

Making sure we have that minimum

And so the proclamation really does

22

reflect a -- it is different than past

23

proclamations, but it is typical in the sense

24

that it seeks to identify harmful conduct that

25

a foreign government is engaging in, and then

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

it imposes sanctions in order to pressure that

2

government to change.

3

That's what President Carter did with

4

respect to Iran, what President Reagan did with

5

respect to Cuba.

6

the failure to provide us with that minimum

7

baseline of information.

8

Here, the harmful conduct is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can you represent

9

that no other country that -- that fails all

10

three of the criteria was excluded from this

11

list?

12

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, Your Honor,

13

what I can represent is that the -- the -- the

14

analysis was holistic.

It wasn't if you failed

15

any one or the others.

It was if your overall

16

score was sufficiently low.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So given -­

18

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

So I can represent

19

that all of the countries listed in the

20

proclamation are the same countries that fell

21

below the baseline, with the exception of

22

Somalia, which the proclamation makes quite

23

clear, and the exception of Iraq, which did

24

fall below -- below the baseline but was not

25

subjected to sanctions.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

And I think that this reflects the

2

tailored nature of this proclamation and the

3

fact that it was meant to impose tailored

4

pressure on these countries while also taking

5

into account other types of national security

6

and foreign policy considerations to try to

7

move those countries across the line into

8

acceptability, which we've now seen has been

9

successful, as with the case of the government

10

of Iraq -- of Chad.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In fact, if you

12

compare this proclamation to the Reagan and the

13

Carter proclamations, which I think were one or

14

two sentences, this is longer than any

15

proclamation that -- that I've seen in this

16

particular area.

proclamations by Reagan and Carter, however,

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, they

were almost as broad, but -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -- and -­

8

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

-- to complete my

9

answer to Justice Kennedy's question, this is

10

the most detailed proclamation ever issued in

11

American history.

12

this covers more countries than either

13

President Reagan's or President Carter's

14

covered.

Yes, Your Honor, to be sure,

But it's -­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And more -- and

16

more immigrants, because Carter's only applied

17

to certain immigrants, not to all.

18

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

President Carter's

19

actually applied to all immigrants but then had

20

an exception much like the waiver provision

21

here for national interests and humanitarian

22

concerns.

23

actually very similar to the proclamation here.

24

And -­

25

So I think President Carter's was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

12
1

consular non-reviewability argument -- is that

2

a jurisdictional argument?

3

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, I -­

4

yes, I think it is a jurisdictional argument.

5

And that's why I don't think you really should

6

address any of these issues.

7

The basic rule is that the exclusion

8

of aliens is a political act imbued with

9

foreign policy and national security concerns

10

and, therefore, subject to -­

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I thought

wasn't jurisdictional or at least decided the

14

merits despite the non-reviewability argument

15

that the government made.

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

I think the second

accurate.

think it's precedential one way or another.

23

government?

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yes, it was, Your

Actually, you could -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

13
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so it's

2

an argument we would have been required to

3

address if it were, in fact, jurisdictional?

4

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

I think so.

And

5

so I think one way you could understand it is

6

that it doesn't go to Article III jurisdiction,

7

though it is a justiciability argument and we

8

would urge this Court to accept it because we

9

think it's correct.

10

But even if you don't think that it's

11

correct, we think that this proclamation

12

satisfies the merits because it does fall well

13

within the power of the President under

14

1182(f).

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

If you're about -­
May I turn, General,

to the constitutional claims in this case?

18

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And your principal

20

response to the Establishment Clause claim is

21

to cite Mandel and to say that, once the

22

government comes forward with a legitimate

23

reason -- of course, national security is the

24

most important reason one can come forward with

25

-- the game is over, essentially.

And I just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

want to press on that a little bit.

2

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure.

So, first, I want to

4

ask whether that means -- you started off by

5

talking a lot about the process of this

6

proclamation.

7

argument would apply irrespective of what

8

process was used.

9

But I -- I take it that that

In other words, you would have made

10

the same Mandel argument to the first executive

11

order in this case, or would you not?

12

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

We would have made

13

a Mandel argument, but it is far stronger given

14

that you have the process and substance upon

15

which this proclamation was based, because

16

whatever you -­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess I wonder

18

why that is, just because, when I read Mandel,

19

I don't see anything about process or you have

20

to meet a certain kind of bar.

21

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23
24
25

Uh-huh.

Mandel really is kind

of you state a reason and this Court stops.
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And I think that

that is right, but I think that when you, in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

addition to that, have the extensive worldwide

2

process that we had that resulted in a

3

cabinet-level recommendation, that applied a

4

neutral baseline to every country in the world,

5

concluded that almost all the world, including

6

almost all of the Muslim-majority world passed

7

that baseline, but a tiny number of countries

8

didn't, I think that whether you apply Mandel

9

or whether you apply McCreary, that makes the

10

constitutional case in our favor overwhelmingly

11

strong.

12

It's a -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So let me give you a

13

hypothetical, and it's just -- you know, I

14

think that there are ways to distinguish Mandel

15

in this case, but -- but -- but, you know, just

16

in terms of thinking about what Mandel really

17

forecloses here.

18

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And I -- because

19

Mandel, there are only two cases in the area,

20

and it's -- it's hard to understand the full

21

contours of it.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I agree.

So this is a

23

hypothetical that you've heard a variant of

24

before that the government has, at any rate,

25

but I want to just give you.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

So let's say in some future time a -­

2

a President gets elected who is a vehement

3

anti-Semite -­

4

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.

-- and says all kinds

6

of denigrating comments about Jews and provokes

7

a lot of resentment and hatred over the course

8

of a campaign and in his presidency and, in the

9

course of that, asks his staff or his cabinet

10

members to issue a proc -- to issue

11

recommendations so that he can issue a

12

proclamation of this kind, and they dot all the

13

i's and they cross all the t's.

14

And what emerges -- and, again, in the

15

context of this virulent anti-Semitism -- what

16

emerges is a proclamation that says no one

17

shall enter from Israel.

18

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20
21

Right.

Do you say Mandel puts

an end to judicial review of that set of facts?
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

No, Your Honor, I

22

don't say Mandel puts an end to it, but I do

23

say that, in that context, Mandel would be the

24

starting point of the analysis, because it does

25

involve the exclusion of aliens, which is where

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

Mandel applies.

2

If his cabinet -- and this is a very

3

tough hypothetical that we've dealt with

4

throughout -- but if his cabinet were to

5

actually come to him and say, Mr. President,

6

there is honestly a national security risk here

7

and you have to act, I think then that the

8

President would be allowed to follow that

9

advice even if in his private heart of hearts

10

he also harbored animus.

national security.

6

7

in my hypothetical.

9

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

10

We -- we -- we

don't have those, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and, you know,

12

he thinks that there are good diplomatic

13

reasons, and there might -- who knows what the

14

future holds, that there might be good

15

diplomatic reasons to put pressure on Israel or

16

to say we want Israel to vote a certain way in

17

the U.N. and this is a way to better our

18

diplomatic hand, and so this is what he does.

19

And -- and who knows what his heart of

20

hearts is.

I mean, I take that point.

But the

21

question is not really what his heart of hearts

22

is.

in which this hypothetical President -­

2

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

-- is making virulent

anti-Semitic comments.
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

And, Your

6

Honor, it's a tough hypothetical, but it's why

7

I also think that this is a relatively easy

8

case, because we're willing to even assume for

9

the sake of argument that you consider all of

10
11

the statements.
And we're even willing to assume for

12

the sake of argument, though we think that it's

13

wrong, that you applied some kind of domestic

14

establishment clause jurisprudence, because

15

we're quite confident that, given the process

16

and substance that form the basis of this

17

proclamation, no matter what standard you

18

apply, this proclamation is constitutional.

19

Since we don't have the extreme

12

doesn't actually apply to the Respondents.

13

only applies to aliens abroad who have no

14

constitutional right to enter.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It

No, but the claim

16

is that it -- that the proclamation is in place

17

because of a dislike of a particular religion.

18

And I thought the Establishment Clause at its

19

heart is that we cannot be anything but neutral

20

with respect to religion or its practice.

21

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

That is true, Your

22

Honor, but as the Valley Forge decision makes

23

clear, not everybody has standing to challenge

24

that negative message injury.

25

plaintiffs in Valley Forge would have had

Otherwise, the

standing to challenge the land transfer from

2

the government to the Christian college on the

3

ground that it sent a pro-Christian or

4

anti-atheist message.

5

That -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But these people

6

are saying that that negative religious

7

attitude is stopping them -­

8

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- from doing

10

things that they would otherwise be able to do:

11

To associate with scholars from these

12

countries, to bring in students, to have family

13

members join them.

14

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Which is one of

16
17

the purposes of the INS.
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And -- and that's

18

where they might have free exercise or free

19

speech claims along the type that Justice

20

Kennedy suggested -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but I -­

22

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

23

couldn't support a nationwide injunction.

don't think that that gives them an

25

Establishment Clause claim when the

I

proclamation doesn't actually apply to them

2

because -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, today,

4

can we go back to something that's been

5

bothering me here, which is -- and it was

6

argued in a case this week about the unitary

7

executive theory, which basically says the

8

President is at the head, I think -- I'm

9

summarizing in an incomplete way -­

10

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Uh-huh.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- but that the

12

President is the head of the executive branch

13

and that he should have, for those who are in

14

the extreme of this theory or -- or on one end

15

of the theory -­

16

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Uh-huh.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- not extreme,

18

that he can hire or fire anyone he wants and

19

that he can put in place whatever policy he

20

wants.

21

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Uh-huh.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we take Justice

23

Kagan's hypothetical President -­

24

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Uh-huh.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- who basically

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

says to his review committee, I want to keep

2

out Jews -­

3

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Uh-huh.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- period; find a

5
6

way.

That's their charge.
So, in that situation, why would the

7

actions of the committee, whatever this is,

8

Executive Committee, not be subject to great

9

suspicion and to thorough review -- which

10

actually wasn't completely -­

11

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Uh-huh.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- done here -­

13

given that they are responsible to the

14

executive -­

15

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and they've

17

been told what the outcome of their

18

deliberations must be?

19
20
21

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Sure.

And I have

two responses to that, Your Honor.
The first is that the President's

22

cabinet, just like all of us here, is

23

duty-bound to protect and defend the

24

Constitution.

25

cabinet member were given that order, that

So I would expect that if any

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

cabinet member would refuse to comply or resign

2

in the face of a plainly unconstitutional

3

order.

4

check.

So I think that would be the initial

5

Secondly, if you had an extreme

6

scenario where all of that broke down, then, if

7

the President actually did make that

8

statement -- I want to keep out a particular

9

race or a particular religion, no matter

10

what -- that would undermine the facial

11

legitimacy of the action, even under the Mandel

12

standard.

13

Here, however, you don't have anything

14

like that.

15

its job through the agencies, where they ask

16

the agencies to construct and apply this

17

neutral standard to every country in the world,

18

including every Muslim country.

19

that the vast majority of the world, including

20

the vast majority of the Muslim world, was just

21

fine, but there were problems with a small

22

number of countries and so imposed pressure,

23

recommended pressure, to help move those

24

countries across the line.

25

Rather, you have the cabinet doing

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They concluded

General, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

problem is that I don't see that that material

2

was reviewed by the judges below, by the Ninth

3

Circuit or the Fourth Circuit judges.

4

I thought that the government had kept

5

confidential and refused to share, either with

6

the litigants or the courts, exactly what was

7

done, how, what the evaluation and how -­

8

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- it was applied

10

to all those countries in the world.

11

I understand some of the

12

confidentiality that might concern you, but if

13

the backdrop is the way that Justice Kagan

14

described it -­

15

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- that -- that

18

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, I -- yeah -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- anti-Semitic

17

heated -­

20

background, don't you think that once you get

21

through the Mandel preliminary stage, that you

22

need an independent arbiter to look at all of

23

that to ensure the process, in fact, is what is

24

claimed it was?

25

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, Your Honor,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1
2

a couple of responses to that.
First of all, I think that the

3

proclamation is very transparent and lays out

4

in great detail both the process and the

5

substance upon which the proclamation is based.

6

And I think that under the duty of

7

regularity or good faith, or whatever you want

8

to call it, that one branch of the government

9

owes to another coequal branch of the

10

government, there is a very strong presumption

11

that what is being set out there is the truth.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You -- you said

13

something earlier, General, I want to make sure

14

that I got it right.

15

the President had said we don't want Muslims

16

coming into this country -­

17

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You said if at the time

Uh-huh.

-- that that would

19

undermine the proclamation.

20

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

Did I get you right?
Yes.

So I -- I think, you

24

know, honestly, the difference here then seems

25

to be is everything that the President said

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1
2

effectively that?
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

I think there are

3

two issues, Your Honor, there.

The first is

4

whether you can ever consider things like

5

campaign statements.

6

the view that campaign statements are made by a

7

private citizen before he takes the oath of

8

office and before, under the Opinions Clause of

9

the Constitution, receives the advice of his

10

cabinet, and that those are constitutionally

11

significant acts that mark the fundamental

12

transformation from being a private citizen to

13

the embodiment of the executive branch.

14

that those statements should be out of bounds.

And we are very much of

15

But for -­

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So

But suppose you have

17

a local mayor and, as a candidate, he makes

18

vituperative hate -- hateful statements, he's

19

elected, and on day two, he takes acts that are

20

consistent with those hateful statements.

21

That's -- whatever he said in the campaign is

22

irrelevant?

23

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Your -- Your

24

Honor, if he takes the same oath -­

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You would say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

whatever he said in the campaign is irrelevant?

2

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

I would say two

3

things.

4

thing is the point I was about to turn to.

5

would say yes, because we do think that oath

6

marks a fundamental transformation, but I would

7

also say here it doesn't matter, because, here,

8

the statements that they principally rely on

9

don't actually address the meaning of the

10

And that was the -- and the second
I

proclamation itself.

11

This is not a so-called Muslim ban.

12

If it were, it would be the most ineffective

13

Muslim ban that one could possibly imagine

14

since not only does it exclude the vast

15

majority of the Muslim world, it also omits

16

three Muslim-majority countries that were

17

covered by past orders, including Iraq, Chad,

18

and Sudan.

19

And so this order is what it purports

20

to be and what its process and substance

21

confirms that it is.

22

based on a multi-agency worldwide review that

23

applied neutral criteria all across the world

24

and concluded, under those neutral criteria,

25

most of the world was fine, but a small part of

It is an order that is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

it failed to provide us with that minimum

2

baseline of information, the minimum, not the

3

ideal, the bare minimum -- terrorism history,

4

criminal history -- that we need to protect the

5

country.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Can -­

7

can I ask a more -- I did read, I think, almost

8

all the 80 briefs.

Now your time -- what do -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
worry.

11

Yeah, don't

Please go ahead.
JUSTICE BREYER:

All

12

right.

13

some were repetitive, not too many.

14

think I know the basic arguments, but there's

15

one question I'm left with and it starts with

16

an assumption, which I think you share, but I

17

want to be sure.

18

All right.

All right.

Almost 80, and I think I -­
And I

All right.

I noticed that the Carter order and

19

the Reagan order both had case-by-case

20

exceptions.

21

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.

And I looked at this

23

order, and this has case-by-case exceptions.

24

And then it says -- you know, it says

25

case-by-case waivers may be appropriate in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

individual circumstances, such as, giving some

2

examples, the following.

3

And then they have to be no

4

terrorists.

Well, that's the law anyway.

5

they -- they have to be in the interests of the

6

United States.

7

hardship, which the only time the word

8

"hardship" appears in the immigration laws, it

9

says "extreme hardship."

And there can't be undue

10

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

And

Uh-huh.

So "undue" must be

less than "extreme."

13

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.

Okay?

So I'm -- then

15

they have a list:

16

previously established, business reasons,

17

they've been here studying, or other long-term

18

activity, they want to visit or reside with a

19

close family member, they have a disease or

something that they need -­

that class of individuals.

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

quite a few who have -- do fall within that

7

class.

12

So -­
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, yes, Your

Honor, but there's only a small number of
people that seek to come into our country.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's what I'm

asking about.

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

JUSTICE BREYER:

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

You see?
Yeah.

That's now -- if you

-- you think -- now, as far as we're concerned,

if they fall within that class, there -­

there's no reason given here why they should be

20

excluded, other than the -- the normal

21

processes?

22
23

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, a couple of

responses, Your Honor.

of the reason -­

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

11

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

-- they should be

excluded, one of the principal purposes of the

13

proclamation is to exert diplomatic pressure on

should be excluded?

So you think they

-- for the waiver.

Okay.

So

there's -­
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

That's why we have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

-- that's why we have the waiver.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's -- that's -­

3

that's what I thought you would say.

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

my question.

Then I get -- can ask

Sorry.

7

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

Yes.

But I want to be sure

we're the same wavelength.

10

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Okay.

Now, falling

13

within that class, here is the problem.

14

seems to me that there are probably a

15

significant number of such people.

16

read the briefs, you think, hey, there's the

17

business community complaining, there's the

18

academic community, there were 46 scholars at

19

Harvard, there -- there are families in the

20

Lisa Blatt brief, you know, that -- that they

21

say we were trying to get medical treatment and

22

nobody told us about this, and -- and they've

23

only admitted two and there's supposed to be

24

guidance, and -­

25

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

It

And you

That's not true.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- you haven't put in

2

the guidance, and -- and -- and the most there

3

are is 100.

4

you have done the same thing that the Reagan

5

people did and the Carter people did, then it

6

might be -- I'm not expressing a definite

7

opinion -- but, well, you've got the same thing

8

here, but if this is, as one brief says, just

9

window dressing and they never apply it -­

And so there is my question.

10

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

If

Right.

-- then you have

12

something new and different going well beyond

13

what President Reagan did.

14

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sure.

Okay.

So I want to

16

know how do I find out -- how do I find out

17

when there is not that information in the

18

brief, do we have to -- can we have another

19

hearing?

20

the government, of course, thinks this isn't

21

window dressing -­

Do we send it back?

22

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

23

10

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And two responses.

And -- and is it well

3

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

-- to that.

One

4

is I don't know how well publicized it is, but

5

I suspect that people understand how to get it.

6

My second principal response is,

7

though, that, frankly, in terms of the

8

legality, I think that the waiver is not

9

necessary, although it is a very good thing,

10

which is why -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Not necessary.

12

-- there you have President Reagan -­

is why most of these proclamations often have

them.

to consider -­

20

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

-- the law that

actually requires it.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

waiver.

The answer

10

to my -- your question, Your Honor, is, no, I

11

don't want you to consider the proclamation on

the President's going to get a pass absolutely

on, you know, what he says the emergency is.

removed?

legislation about this.

that hypothetical, we'll concede the

23

hypothetical.

24
25

He's never even introduced
So we're so far from

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, imagine

-- imagine, if you can, that Congress is unable

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

to act when the President asked for

2

legislation.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. KATYAL:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.
And someone

6

introduces a bill saying let's authorize -­

7

first of all, the President may have qualms

8

about sharing that absolute intelligence

9

broadly, but let's say there's a bill

10

introduced to say let's authorize the President

11

and there's a bill introduced to say let's

12

block the President, and neither bill moves.

13

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely.

We

14

understand the President will have residual

15

authority to keep the country safe.

16

here, though, is that Congress has thought

17

about this exact problem, including, you know

18

-- you know, about -- there -- there's only one

19

problem he's identifying, which is countries

20

not cooperating.

21

Our point

He's not talking about people coming

22

in or something like that, like your

23

hypothetical.

24

Congress has said here's how we deal with it.

25

We deal with it with the individualized vetting

And with respect to that,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43

system, which pushes all the burdens on a

2

person coming in.

3

That's 1361.

You've got to show biometric ID under

4

the statute.

5

6

is from a country that's a state sponsor of

7

terrorism, like your hypothetical or anything

8

else.

9

You've got to have an in-person

So Congress has really said in a

10

robust way, here's how we would deal with it.

11

And to the extent countries aren't cooperating,

12

we offer carrots.

13

Congress rejected exactly what they're

14

trying to propose here, which is a flat

15

nationality ban.

16

force of our argument lies with respect to the

17

first point, which is this is countermanding

18

Congress's policy judgments.

19
20
21
22

And that's where I think the

My friend on the other side actually
in his brief -­
JUSTICE ALITO:
Congress did act.

It enacted 1182(f).

23

MR. KATYAL:

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

Well, Congress did -­

Correct.
Why doesn't this fall

squarely within the language of 1182(f)?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

MR. KATYAL:

For -- for -- we have

2

both textual reasons that it's not a class, for

3

reasons Justice Breyer was talking about.

4

not perpetuated -- it's perpetual, like Justice

5

Ginsburg was talking about.

6

there's a much bigger point, Justice Alito,

7

which is -­

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:
talk about the text.

It's

But we think

Well, maybe you could

It's not a class?

10

Doesn't 11 -- doesn't 1182(f) say whenever the

11

President finds that the entry of any aliens -­

12

MR. KATYAL:

Correct.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- or any class of

14

aliens.

15

really see why people who are nationals of a

16

particular country don't constitute a class.

17

What about any aliens?

18

So put class aside, although I don't

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

So we think it is

19

any, you know -- because the power in 1182 is

20

so broad and sweeping and does allow the

21

President to supplement what Congress has done,

22

we think that you have to -- you have to be

23

careful and read limit -- you have to read it

24

just the way you read every other statute to

25

say, how do we harmonize that broad text of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

1182(f) with the rest of the INA?

2

And our point in our briefs, which I

3

don't think you heard an answer to, is, if you

4

accept their idea that the President has such a

5

sweeping power, he could end, for example,

6

family -- the family preference system and

7

impose, you know, and end so-called chain

8

migration or anything like that.

9

-- countermand any of the provisions of the INA

10

He could do

and turn it into a line item veto.

11

So, for that reason, we think there

12

has to be some limit.

13

Court's dealt with in, you know, the tobacco

14

case or -­

15

That's something this

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, does this

16

proclamation do anything like that?

17

proclamation purport to establish a new

18

permanent immigration policy for the United

19

States?

20

MR. KATYAL:

Does this

Absolutely, Your Honor.

21

This is a perpetual policy that bans.

It does

22

exactly what Congress in 1965 said you can't

23

do.

24

fine-grained reticulated judgment from 2001,

25

2015, and several other times, which is to say,

And it countermands Congress's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

instead of these flat bans, we're going to have

2

-- we're going to balance foreign policy

3

considerations, economic considerations, like

4

the U.S. companies brief, humanitarian, image

5

of the United States views, all of that

6

together, and said we won't do the flat ban.

7

Instead, we're going to have a much

8

more fine-grained approach with individualized

9

vetting and carrots for the countries that

10

don't disagree -- that don't cooperate.

11
12

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is your basis for

saying that it is perpetual?

13

MR. KATYAL:

Well, there's nothing in

14

the order that ends it.

16

orders.

22

end of the report.

3

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Kennedy, this

4

argument wouldn't be there if there was

5

anything about reassessment, the way there are

6

in about half the orders, including the Cuba

7

order, which says it sunsets once the crisis

8

ends.

There's nothing like that in this.

9

And it's just like a reporting

10

requirement to Congress in which Congress isn't

11

necessarily required to do anything.

12

has statutes like that all the time.

13

This is that.

Congress

And that's why this is

14

unlike any other executive order.

15

back and look at all 43 executive orders that

16

Presidents have issued, none of them have even

17

arguably countermanded Congress's judgment in

18

the area.

19

They've all been supplements.

20

If you go

They've all been consistent.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the statute

says first that -- that -- that 1182 for such

22

period as he deems necessary, and he can have

23

continuing supervision over whether it's still

24

necessary.

25

MR. KATYAL:

Again, we wouldn't have a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

problem with that if it was tailored to a

2

crisis, it says it sunsets, and then, you know,

months we're going to have a safe world?

MR. KATYAL:

Well -- well -- well, no,

10

Justice Kennedy, that's not our argument.

Our

11

argument is, here, the President is identifying

12

something that is a perennial problem.

14

when the Soviet Union was around, we don't have

15

18

have a fine-grained vetting system to balance

19

these considerations.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the

21

military advisors tell the President that, in

22

their judgment, the President ought to order a

23

strike, an air strike against Syria, and the

24

President says, well -- does that mean he can't

25

because you would regard that as discrimination

2

against a majority Muslim country?
MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely not.

There's

3

nothing to do with the text of the statute.

4

The 1152 statute's about discrimination and the

5

"issuance of visas."

6

And that's all that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, under

7

1182(f), you would say that there's no problem

8

under that provision?

9

MR. KATYAL:

Well, under 1182, as I

10

understand, it was a strike.

11

think there's any immigration issue in your

12

hypothetical.

13

Mr. Chief Justice.

And so I don't

I might be misunderstanding it,

15

of targeted action that would have a impact on

the Muslim population.

that have impacts on the Muslim population.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -- I guess the

3

question, though, Mr. Katyal, is maybe you're

limits to prevent the President from doing

section of the statute.

contemplated by the rest of the statute.

supplant.

infiltration of the United States by terrorists

such situation?
MR. KATYAL:

And the

22

with that.

So -­

And your argument is

that courts have the -- the duty to review

Heritage Reporting Corporation

whether or not there is such a national

2

exigency; that's for the courts to do, not the

3

President?

wide deference, Justice Kennedy.

what you said when you joined Justice Breyer's

opinion in Hamdan, which is, as long as -- you

know, Presidents have wide berth in this area,

sort of emergency that precludes it.
But when you have a statute that

12

considers the very same problem and there's

13

nothing new that they've identified in this

worldwide review process that Congress didn't

15

consider exactly the same types of things, it

questions arise in particular contexts.

presidential findings for the rest of the

19

20

MR. KATYAL:

So, Mr. Chief Justice, I

21

first want to be very clear about this.

22

point about 1152 and the discrimination has

23

nothing to do with any campaign statements or

24

anything else.

25

It's purely the text of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Our

proclamation, which is nationality-based

2

discrimination through and through.

3

Sentelle said you couldn't imagine a clearer

4

text than this.

Now -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My question

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. KATYAL:

Yes.

I just want to make

12

absolutely clear that we're -- that's not -­

13

you know, you don't need to do any of that for

14

purposes of 1152.

15

39 percent of the most important part of the

16

executive order.

And that would knock out

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now I'm getting -­
-- was not on

1152.

22
23

My question,

MR. KATYAL:

Yes.

I'm getting there.

Okay.
With respect to that, we don't think
-- we think that the test, as this Court has

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

said, a reasonable, objective observer viewing

2

all the statements, and we think, absolutely,

3

my friend is right, you shouldn't look to

4

campaign statements in general or stuff like

5

that, statements of a private citizen.

6

The only thing is, here, they

7

themselves, the President and his staff, have

8

rekindled exactly that.

9

of our red brief, you have a very good example

10

If you look at page 70

of this.

11

After the executive order, this latest

12

executive order was promulgated, the President

13

tweeted these three virulent anti-Muslim

14

videos.

15

asked:

What does this mean?

16

about?

And the answer was:

17

spoken about exactly this in the proclamation.

And then the press spokesman was
What is this
The President has

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

was whether or not the inhibition on the

20

ability to -- to enter one of the proclamations

21

applies forever?

22

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

My question

No, I think the

23

President could have disclaimed -- you know,

24

easily moved away from all of these statements,

25

you know, but instead they embraced them.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

That's the difference.

2

And so, absolutely, the President

3

would have wide berth to say that's a -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, if

5

tomorrow he issues a proclamation saying he's

6

disavowing all those statements, then the next

7

day he can reenter this proclamation?

8
9

MR. KATYAL:

That's exactly what this

Court said in McCreary.

This Court in McCreary

10

said, you know, the same policy can be

11

constitutional if said -- if promulgated by one

12

entity and not by another, depending on the

13

circumstances around it.

14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is your answer

to my question yes?

16

MR. KATYAL:

Yes.

The answer is -­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Tomorrow, he

18

issues a proclamation disavowing those

19

statements -­

20
21
22

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely.

And that's a

-CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

next day he could reenter this and your

24

discrimination argument would not be

25

applicable?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. KATYAL:

And -- and -- and, Mr.

2

Chief Justice, that's exactly what I told the

3

Ninth Circuit in May.

4

that.

5

that's what a reasonable, objective observer -­

The President didn't do

That's what's -- that's -- you know,

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if another -­

Mr. Katyal, would any

8

reasonable observer reading this proclamation,

9

with -- without taking into account statements,

10

think that this was a Muslim ban?

11

I mean, there are -- I think there are

12

50 predominantly Muslim countries in the world.

13

Five -- five countries -- five predominantly

14

Muslim countries are on this list.

15

The population of the -- of the

16

predominantly Muslim countries on this list

17

make up about 8 percent of the world's Muslim

18

population.

19

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you looked at the

21

10 countries with the most Muslims, exactly

22

one -­

23

MR. KATYAL:

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

Right.
-- Iran, would be on

that list of the top 10.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

MR. KATYAL:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

Right.
So would a reasonable

observer think this was a Muslim ban?

4

MR. KATYAL:

If it were -- if it were

5

just the text of the order alone, it might

6

raise eyebrows, for fit and other reasons that

7

the briefs go into, but we wouldn't be here.

8

We absolutely agree that just -- it's the same

9

test as in Lukumi and other cases.

You have to

10

look to all the circumstances around it that

11

are said, the publicly available ones.

12

You know, and, Justice Alito, the fact

13

that the order only come -- encompasses some

14

Muslim countries I don't think means it's not

15

religious discrimination.

16

an employer and I have 10 African-Americans

17

working for me and I only fire two of them, I

18

don't think -- you know, and say, well, I've

19

left the other eight in, I don't think anyone

20

can say that's not discrimination.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

For example, if I'm

No, I -- I understand

22

that.

And it is one of our fundamental values

23

that there is religious freedom here for

24

everybody in that, number -- adherence to every

25

religion are entitled to equal treatment.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

My only point is that if you look at

2

what was done, it does not look at all like a

3

Muslim ban.

4

that jump out as to why these particular

5

countries were put on -- on the list.

6

There are other justifications

So you -- it seems to me the list

7

creates a strong inference that this was not

8

done for that invidious purpose.

9

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Alito, I think if

10

it were just the list, I think we'd be right -­

11

you'd be right, although I'd point out that

12

you, yourself, in the Stormans case said that

13

it's a religious -- it raises an inference of

14

religious gerrymander, of "the burden imposed

15

falls almost exclusively on those with

16

religious objections."

17

This is a ban that really does fall

18

almost exclusively on Muslims, between

19

90.2 percent and 99.8 percent Muslims.

20

it does look very much like what you said in

21

Stormans.

22

if it weren't for all of the different

23

statements.

24
25

And so

But even then, we wouldn't be here

And the best evidence of this, about
what a reasonable, objective observer would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

think, is to look at the wide variety of amicus

2

briefs in this case from every corner of

3

society representing millions and millions of

4

people from the U.S. Conference of Catholic

5

Bishops, which calls it "blatant religious

6

discrimination."

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Katyal, on that,

8

it's been a long time since this Court has used

9

the Lemon test, reasonable observer, even to

10

strike down a domestic statute, let alone

11

something with purely international

12

application.

13

What -- what do we do about that?

MR. KATYAL:

Yeah, so two things.

14

Number one is I think the very fact that this

15

is immigration cuts the other way.

16

heart of the First Amendment is about

17

immigration restrictions on, for example,

18

Catholics at the founding and our protest of

19

King George, which is all about using the

20

immigration power to exclude people of a

21

different faith.

22

Constitution is about.

23

thing.

24
25

I mean, the

And that's what our
So that's the first

And the second is we don't think you
have to get into Lemon and all these other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1

tests that you all have struggled with.

2

think this Court in Lukumi was very clear in

3

saying that, when you're talking about

4

denigration of religion, all the tests point in

5

the same direction.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I

Mr. Katyal, you

7

said something earlier, you said you wouldn't

8

be here if all of those statements, the

9

background statements, were not made.

Do you

10

mean that on all of your bases?

11

be here on the Establishment Clause claim?

12

MR. KATYAL:

You wouldn't

Only on the Establishment

13

Clause claim, not on anything else.

14

point is, you know, he talks about, for

15

example, this worldwide vetting process.

16
17

And our

Remember his own argument on 1182 is
the statute puts the President -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

go back to not being here without the

20

statements.

21

conceded by your adversary, do give you a basis

22

to look behind, all right, the reason.

23

So let's -- let's

Clearly, the statements, even

So, if we're looking behind it, how do

24

you deal with the General's suggestion that

25

there was a cleansing that occurred because of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1

all of the agencies and departments who

2

participated in this process?

3

MR. KATYAL:

Yeah.

So there's three

4

things.

5

argument is that 1182 puts the President in the

6

driver's seat, so the cabinet's not important.

7

It's the President's proclamation.

8
9

Number one is that his -- his own

Second, the order itself says in its
first lines, it harkens back to Executive

10

Orders 1 and 2, and it says it's an outgrowth

11

of that.

12

that was struck down on Establishment Clause

13

grounds in other cases.

14

So it was infected by the same thing

And third, and most importantly, the

15

President before this review process even began

16

tweeted and said that he wanted a tougher ban,

17

a non-politically-correct ban and the like.

18

So given all of those things, but, in

19

particular, given the fact that 1182 itself

20

forces the President to make the proclamation,

21

it's the President's proclamation, so I don't

22

think you even have to get into this whole

23

unitary executive thing, but I do agree with

24

you, Justice Sotomayor, that that's another

25

problem, which is they're coming before the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
70
1

Court and saying:

2

who's in charge.

3

Oh, no, no, no, it's these other people.

4

Nope, it's the President
And now they're saying here:

This is the President's proclamation

5

through and through.

No President has ever

6

said anything -- anything like this.

7

that's what makes this different.

8

And the President -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

And -- and yet, Mr.

10

Katyal, you have a proclamation that says there

11

are important national security interests at

12

stake.

13

of analysis that you want us to do without in

14

some sense evaluating the adequacy of those

15

national security interests, which for the most

16

part we've said courts are not equipped to do.

17

And the question is how to do the kind

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

We're not asking

18

you to second-guess a national security

19

judgment at all with the purpose of the

20

Establishment Clause.

21

We're saying you just have to look to

22

what a reasonable, objective observer would do.

23

That's the ordinary test that you've used in

24

cases like Lukumi.

25

purpose to disparage a religion?

Is there an official

2

that the President has said and that the order

itself embodies.

4

problem.

5

That's, you know, everything

That's our fundamental

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you think -­

6

it's a -- it's a -- it's still something I'm -­

7

I'm thinking about, perhaps to the side, but

8

the statute you point to, one of the ones that

9

is stronger for you.

There are obviously

10

objections to what you're saying in quite a few

11

briefs, all right, but the one that you talked

12

about, it does say you have to have an

13

interview with a consular official if the

14

person is from a country officially designated

15

by the Secretary as a state sponsor of

16

terrorism.

17

It does say that.

So they'll say, but we do have that in

18

respect to everyone under the exception.

19

there isn't much problem.

20

that in respect to other people.

21

Take their argument for a moment.

22

So

We've gone beyond
All right.

Because my question is, which I

23

couldn't find in the briefs, is, is it true -­

24

I'm just taking what they say -- that really

25

that isn't so, they don't publicize it, they

they can come in and qualify for this.

something that is important to the lawfulness

of the order, because there are many, many

categories there -­

that, just the State of Hawaii has gotten about

of remedy for me.

7

MR. KATYAL:

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

That -­

Yes.
We have this

troubling rise of this nationwide injunction,

10

cosmic injunction -­

relief for the parties at issue or even a class

14

15

MR. KATYAL:

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And, near as I can

17

tell, that's -- that's a really new development

18

where a district court asserts the right to

strike down a -- a federal statute with regard

to anybody anywhere in the world.

21

MR. KATYAL:

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

that, I think, lower courts are debating right

That's something

I think this case is the poorest

example to get into it because of United States

8

9

immigration case, and Article I Section 8 puts

Congress in the driver's seat and says there

11

must be a uniform rule of naturalization.

12

So I think, for those reasons, you

know, I get why the Court might want to get

into it.

1152 point?

9

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yes, Your Honor.

10

1152(a)(1)(A) addresses one thing, the issuance

11

of immigrant visas.

12

broader question over whether somebody's

13

allowed to enter in the first place.

14

It doesn't address the

That's governed by 1182, including

15

1182(f).

16

universe of people who are eligible to come

17

into the country in the first place.

18

So, essentially, 1182 sets the

And that is often a foreign policy and

19

national security judgment.

20

one of the rules that governs how we distribute

21

visas amongst that group that's eligible to

22

come in.

23

1152(a)(1)(A) is

And it's not just nationality-based

24

distinctions that it applies to.

It also

25

applies to things like place of residence.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So,

Official
81
1

once you have that universe of eligible people,

2

1152(a)(1)(A) governs how you distribute them.

3

But let's assume that you disagreed

4

with me.

5

have to implement this proclamation in a

6

slightly different way.

7

All it would really mean is that we

We would have to issue immigrant visas

8

but not non-immigrant visas to people who

9

aren't allowed to enter, but we wouldn't have

10

to allow anyone to enter and we wouldn't have

11

to issue any non-immigrant visas.

12
13
14

So the bottom line is I think they're
simply wrong on that case -- on that issue.
My final point has to do with my -- my

15

brother's recognition that, if the President

16

were to say tomorrow that he was sorry, all of

17

this would go away.

18

made crystal-clear on September 25 that he had

19

no intention of imposing the Muslim ban.

20

Well, the President has

He has made crystal-clear that Muslims

21

in this country are great Americans and there

22

are many, many Muslim countries who love this

23

country, and he has praised Islam as one of the

24

great countries of the world.

25

This proclamation is about what it
