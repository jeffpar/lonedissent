CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 16-1371,

5

Byrd versus United States.

6

Mr. Loeb.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. LOEB

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. LOEB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In this case, the government seeks to

12

transform a violation of a car rental agreement

13

into a rule where unlisted drivers have no

14

ability to even invoke the Fourth Amendment.

15

The government's proposed rule should

16

be rejected for at least three reasons:

17

ignoring a person's privacy expectations when

18

he locks his personal property in a car's

19

locked trunk with the permission of the renter

20

is contrary to this Court's reasonable -- of

21

expectation of privacy test, which looks to

22

privacy expectations and not contract terms and

23

not property rights.

24
25

First,

And while the contract violation
alleged here does not negate Fourth Amendment

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

rights, it's notable that Mr. Byrd's presence

2

in the car -- and the government does not

3

dispute this -- was not improper.

4

of his personal items in the trunk was not even

5

a contract violation.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

His storing

Could he have been

7

-- could he have been the renter, given his

8

criminal record?

9

MR. LOEB:

Perhaps not, Your Honor.

10

But he was given permission by the renter to

11

store his items in the locked trunk, and the

12

government does not argue that that was

13

impermissible.

14
15
16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose he had been

just a passenger and the renter was there.
MR. LOEB:

Likewise, even if he is

17

just a passenger, if the person who has rented

18

the car gives him permission to lock his own

19

personal property in the trunk of the car, he

20

has a reasonable expectation of privacy that

21

strangers will not rummage through his personal

22

property in that locked trunk.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the

24

Budget rental agreement had, you know, in big

25

letters on it, if anyone is stopped driving

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

this car, they must consent to police search?

2

You know, Budget doesn't want to be involved in

3

promoting criminal activity.

4

MR. LOEB:

Your Honor, the -- first of

5

all, Mr. Byrd didn't sign the agreement.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that -- so

7

that allows him to escape from those

8

provisions?

9

MR. LOEB:

Moreover, those provisions

10

would not define what a person's constitutional

11

rights are.

12

reasonable expectations of privacy.

13

This Court has looked to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -­

Okay, well,

14

what if -- what if Reed told him, look, I don't

15

-- you know, I -- I know your background; I

16

don't want you transporting flak jackets and

17

heroin in the trunk of this car that I've

18

rented?

19

MR. LOEB:

That would be different

20

than that he was not given permission by the

21

renter to store his personal property in the

22

trunk.

23

But instead, in this record here -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So then in

24

that case the police -- he -- the police could

25

go through the trunk without a warrant?

MR. LOEB:

I don't think so, Your

Still -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so Reed

4

tells him don't put stuff in my trunk and -­

5

but you can take the car?

6

MR. LOEB:

I'm sorry, in your

7

hypothetical where he's barred from -- from

8

doing that, I would -- I would agree that he

9

doesn't -- that he may -- doesn't have

10

permission to use the trunk and he may be more

11

like the passengers in -- in the Rakas case.

12

It would be a little -- I would still say he

13

has a Fourth Amendment right to invoke there -­

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. LOEB:

16
17

If the -­

-- but a more difficult

situation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- but if

18

the police have access to, going back to my

19

first hypothetical, the -- the rental

20

agreement, which they probably would, you've

21

got to have the rental agreement in the car,

22

they say let me see your license or -- or

23

title, and then he gives them the Budget

24

agreement and the agreement says you must

25

consent to police search if you're stopped.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

What about that?

MR. LOEB:

Again, that kind of

3

contract of adhesion you wouldn't ordinarily

read -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Contract of

adhesion?
MR. LOEB:

When you go into a rental

8

agreement, it pops up on a little screen where

9

they tell you to use their electronic signature

10

thing and sign off on it.

11

you're not -­

12

These are terms that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They don't

13

want to rent the car to somebody who's going to

14

put illegal stuff in the car.

15

you know, they want to -- it's their car.

16

want to cooperate with the police in terms of

17

what can be used in their car.

18

well, put aside the contract of adhesion, what

19

-- what then?

I don't -- or,

20

MR. LOEB:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They

I don't -­

Well -­
In other

22

words, he knows that Budget doesn't want him to

23

have an expectation of privacy in the trunk.

But there would not be a -- a

So -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, he knows

5

that the owner of the car, Budget, does not

6

want to give him any privacy in the trunk.

7

police know that the owner of the car does not

8

want to give him any privacy in the trunk.

9

yet, nonetheless, he has an expectation of

11

The

And

privacy?
MR. LOEB:

Your Honor, that may be a

12

harder case because of the expectation -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know

14

it's a harder case, but -- but I'm trying to

15

get to the limits of your theory.

16

MR. LOEB:

Well, in our theory, you

17

have a person in Mr. Byrd's position, he's been

18

given permission to use the trunk, to lock his

19

items in the trunk -­

20
21
22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, I'm

asking about my case.
MR. LOEB:

Yes.

So in -- in -- in

23

that scenario, it's very different in that he's

24

not been given permission to the trunk.

25

maybe under Rakas, you'd say that it's like the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

5

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

And maybe the

Yeah, but -­
And what if the -­

8

what if the rental agreement said that if any

9

unauthorized person uses the car, we consent to

10

a search by the police?

11

MR. LOEB:

Here, if they had called

12

Budget and -- and Budget had said as owner we

13

-- we -- we authorize the search, it may be

14

that they could have searched the car.

15

didn't -- didn't do that.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if -- if they had

called Budget and Budget had said it's okay to

right?

21

MR. LOEB:

It -- it's -- but that

22

would be a very -- a different scenario where

if you look to this Court's Chapman case, they

24

said an inchoate right to properly -- to

25

possibly eject someone from a leased apartment

whether they want to rent a car with Budget

20

they know the owner doesn't like to approve

21

them, but the renter goes ahead and sublets the

22

house or the apartment to a family, under the

I

LaFave, which is called the car rental cases?

policemen and others to understand what it is

12

And your rule in this case is?

13

MR. LOEB:

Our rule is that if you are

14

given permission by the renter to store items,

15

of your personal items in the trunk, you have a

16

reasonable expectation of privacy in it,

same exact scenario if I am borrowing a

4

friend's car and given permission to use the

5

car and the trunk.

6

The same difficulties apply in the rental

7

situation as the friend scenario.

The exact same scenario.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

No -­

Well, you mentioned

the rental situation.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Go ahead.

What about this:

A

13

homeowner is going away for a long weekend,

14

arranges with a teenager in the neighborhood to

15

come in and walk and feed the cat and spend

16

quality time with the cat -­

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- but says under no

19

circumstances may you bring anybody else into

20

the house.

21

But the teen -- and the teenager says

22

okay, fine, and then goes ahead and gives the

23

keys to a friend who uses the house to sell

24

drugs, and the police come in and they conduct

25

a search.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

17

2

Can that trespasser claim that his
Fourth Amendment rights were violated?

3

MR. LOEB:

So this Court has carved

4

out an exception for the criminal trespasser,

5

for the -- the car thief, for it's an exception

6

for when someone's mere presence in the house

7

or the apartment or the car is itself a

8

criminal act, the mere presence is criminal,

9

and where it's an intrusion on another person's

10

privacy.

11

So the friend coming in who's a, in

12

your hypothetical, a criminal trespasser under

13

the Rakas Footnotes 9 and 12, would be

14

considered perhaps in a category of people who

15

cannot invoke Fourth Amendment rights.

16

all, Mr. Byrd's presence in the car is not a

in that circumstance.
And this Court said no, even though

12

there could be an inchoate right of -- of the

13

landlord to evict him, if they knew about the

14

violation of the lease, that does not undermine

15

his Fourth Amendment rights.

16

And same -- same here.

There may be

17

that Budget has an inchoate right to bring a

18

contract action or a tort action against Mr.

19

Byrd, but until they do so, just like in the

20

sublet example, if the landlord -- if the owner

21

finds out about the impermissible sublet and

22

then brings an action of eviction, then you can

23

say at that point on that there is a diminished

24

expectation of privacy that the subleasers have

in that situation.

14

MR. LOEB:

Well, in the suppression

hearing, his testimony was that he had the

16

permission of Ms. Reed and that he had the

17

permission to lock his personal items in the

18

trunk and that he did store his clothing in the

19

car and in the trunk.

22

Court has warned that -- that -- that -­

23

And then we see in the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So I'm having -­

24

I'm having a problem with this case, which is

25

why are we here?

Meaning, once he admitted

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

that the -- that the goods in the trunk were

2

his, I don't know why that doesn't give him

3

automatic standing to challenge the search.

4

I thought in Rakas it was the fact

5

that the defendants had repeated three or four

6

or five different times that the defendants

7

claimed no proprietary interest in the goods

8

searched.

9

isn't it?

10
11

That's different than this case,

MR. LOEB:

Exactly.

Exactly.

Exactly, Your Honor.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

on this legal issue at all?

14

MR. LOEB:

So why are we here

We're -- we're here because

15

the government and the Third Circuit has

16

advocated a rule -- a blanket rule that, if

17

you're an unlisted driver, you never have an

18

expectation of privacy.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Even if you don't

20

have an expectation of privacy in the trunk,

21

you've claimed an expectation of privacy in the

22

property.

23

MR. LOEB:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

And here -­
And absent

probable cause, there's no right to search.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So

why are we here?

MR. LOEB:
that, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're here because

We lost below.
But I'm not -­

she's absolutely right, counselor, but I'm

10

asking why are you pitching this case on the

11

automobile exception.

12

the straightforward point that the whole -­

13

this whole discussion is about who has the

14

right to challenge a search, and without

15

probable cause.

Why don't you just argue

16

MR. LOEB:

Right, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right?

If

18

you're claiming an interest in the property at

19

issue, he's claimed it, he testified, he has a

20

right.

21

So now we go to a suppression hearing.
MR. LOEB:

Right, Your Honor.

And he

22

testified regarding the clothing he put in the

23

car, and you see them rummaging through the

24

trunk when they open that locked trunk, so

25

that's undisputed here.

argument -­

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- if I can -- if I

15

can follow up on -- on Justice Sotomayor's

16

question and -- and Justice Breyer's in terms

17

of what's the clear line we can draw here.

18

You've raised two theories on which you might

19

prevail.

20

essentially, as I understand it, that

21

possession is good title against everybody

22

except for people with superior title.

23

And -- and I understand that.

One, a property law theory,

That's

24

an ancient common law rule.

I can go back and

25

find that in treatises all the way back to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Joseph Story.

2

Or I can do this reasonable

3

expectation of privacy test, and that's what

4

we've been struggling with so far.

5

-- we have to ask what the nature of the

6

contract is and the terms of the contract.

7

might want to look at the nature of the

8

relationship between Mr. Byrd and -- and

9

Ms. Reed.

What's the

There was a lot of debate in the

10

briefs over whether they're girlfriend and

11

boyfriend or fiancée or maybe common law

12

marriage and someone's cheating on someone

13

else.

14

to contend with.

15

whether the test is even an empirical or a

16

normative question.

17

We

All of that's in the briefs that we have
Then we have the question

Do we look at what the reasonable

18

expectations of privacy are by social science

19

data, get my law clerks to go do that, or do we

20

just announce normatively what we think it

21

ought to be?

22

cultural norms across the country?

Should it depend on regional and

23

Gosh, it's very complicated.

24

Professors Baude and Stern, among many others,

25

suggest maybe we ought to look back at that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

property test again.

2

MR. LOEB:

What do you think?
We think the property

3

interest here, the right that he -- that Mr.

4

Byrd would have had to bring a trespass action,

5

demands a recognition of his right to invoke

6

the Fourth Amendment, and it's a very clear and

7

simple rule.

8
9

So the old adage is possession is
nine-tenths of the law, and as you state in

10

your question, that has roots in the common law

11

going back to the 1600s and 1700s.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the problem -­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Wouldn't that apply to

14

criminals too?

JUSTICE ALITO:

The problem -- go

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Wouldn't that apply to

18

criminals too?

19

criminals don't have Fourth Amendment rights.

20

The property-based concepts that Justice

21

Gorsuch was stating would say that criminals

22

have that kind of property interest.

23

We've been very clear that

MR. LOEB:

No, Justice Kagan.

So the

24

Restatement 895, which deals with this under

25

the Restatement of Torts, Second, says just -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

the -- the principle that was articulated, that

2

mere possession would allow you to bring a

3

trespass action against anyone else who invaded

4

it.

5

says where someone is "clearly a thief," the

6

court can deny them the right to bring that

7

trespass or conversion action against the third

8

party, the stranger who's invading the space.

9

But -­

10

But if you look at comment h there, it

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, the problem

11

with going down this property route is that we

12

go off in search of a type of case that almost

13

never arose, if it ever did arose -- arise at

14

common law, where an unauthorized sub-bailee

15

brings an action for trespass to chattel

16

against a law enforcement officer.

17
18
19
20

When would that ever have happened in
18th-century America?
MR. LOEB:

Never.

Well, it's your right to

bring a trespass action against a stranger.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

MR. LOEB:

Yeah.

The fact that you can

23

exclude a stranger and bring a trespass action

24

against him -­

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's -­

property right under the Constitution -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's hard enough to

4

find the case where it's the stranger, where

5

it's the private-party stranger.

6

not what we have here.

7

lawful rights that no private party had, which

8

was to stop this vehicle.

9

But that's

We have a party who has

12

MR. LOEB:

I

Well, their -- their rights

13

-- the police right is confined.

14

they need reasonable suspicion to extend the

15

search, they need probable cause to search the

always been, you know, deemed sacrosanct,

expectations of privacy -­

car and you're in sole possession and control

of it -- the troopers themselves recognized he

2

police from a search unless in being in that

3

house he is committing a crime?

4

MR. LOEB:

Right.

Unless you're

5

committing a criminal trespass or, in the case

6

of the car, the car thief, and especially when

7

you were locking your personal things in the

8

trunk -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's impossible.

Okay, let's see what -­
MR. LOEB:

-- you have an expectation

12

of privacy in that space.

13

foundation of -- of the expectation of privacy

14

is the right to exclude others.

15

Rakas have said that, and it's very clear that

16

both under common sense of who you can exclude

17

and under common law, where you have a right to

18

possess and exclude, that Mr. -- Mr. Byrd has a

19

Fourth Amendment right that he can invoke in

20

this case.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

The -- the -- the

And Jones and

The Constitution uses

the word "property" numerous times, but the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So is it your argument that any

3

definition of "effects" if we are going to go

contingent interests?

So would it include
Would it include future

If somebody has left me a car in a

right to bring a Fourth -- does that implicate

my Fourth Amendment rights?

12

MR. LOEB:

I think if the common law

13

recognizes your right to replevin or to

14

trespass against a stranger, then both under

15

common law and common sense, that it makes

16

sense to recognize a right to invoke a Fourth

17

Amendment right.

18

And still, we're not saying that the

19

police don't have adequate tools here.

20

they're -- if they had reasonable suspicion to

21

extend this stop and further investigate, if

22

they had probable cause, or if they had

23

consent, they could have searched the trunk of

24

the car, but they did not have that here.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If

Mr. Loeb, we've always

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

said that there's a normative component to

2

expectations of privacy.

3

they're those expectations that society has

4

prepared to recognize as reasonable.

5

In other words,

So here you have at the very least a

6

person who's violated important contract terms,

7

terms that are of some significance to the

8

owner of the property, as well as a person who

9

is engaged in conduct that frustrates law

10

enforcement in various ways; get behind the

11

wheel, you're not the person who's authorized

12

to be here, the police don't know who you are.

13

And, you know, this is -- the facts of this

14

case provide a good example of how unauthorized

15

driving can frustrate law enforcement.

16

So why is it that society should be

17

prepared to recognize this conduct as

18

reasonable?

19

MR. LOEB:

Because society recognizes

20

that when you put your personal items in a

21

locked space, if you put it, in Chadwick, in a

22

locked footlocker, you have an expectation of

23

privacy regarding it.

24
25

And the courts don't look behind this
to say, well, are you really engaged in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

criminal conduct, are you a bad guy?

The

2

question is a question of if you're sitting in

3

a car which you have locked and you can lock

4

the car and you've locked the trunk and your

5

personal items, society recognizes an

6

expectation of privacy in that.

7

when he was sitting in the Ford Fusion after

8

he's pulled over by the police, is not

9

wrongfully present.

And Mr. Byrd,

If someone is wrongfully

10

present and creating a criminal act by being

11

present, that's different.

12

concedes he was not wrongfully present in the

13

car, he had his personal items locked in the

14

trunk, and as an objective matter, someone has

15

a -- an expectation -- a reasonable expectation

16

of privacy in those circumstances.

17

expectation is bolstered by the common law,

18

which says he has a right to sue others for

19

trespass if they intruded upon that car.

20

that's true, clearly he can at least at minimum

21

invoke the Fourth Amendment.

But the government

22

I'd like to reserve -­

Suppose it had not been a familial
Suppose it was just a neighbor

Does the familial relationship really
matter?

MR. LOEB:

No, Your Honor.

bolsters the expectation.

family member or a close friend or, here,

10

someone you've been living with for 15 years

11

and you exchanged -- as the record establishes

12

here, exchanged cars on a regular basis, it's

13

reasonable to believe that you can drive the

14

other person's car, that you can lock materials

15

in their trunk when you're driving, and that

you'll have an expectation of privacy when you

do so.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Justice, and may it please the Court:

2

To challenge the search in this case,

3

Petitioner has the affirmative burden to prove

4

a connection to Budget's car that would justify

5

treating it as his effect for purposes of the

6

7

He can't do that when he sent Reed

into the rental office alone to rent a car he

Is that son in the same position as
Mr. Reed?
MR. FEIGIN:

I think as a matter of

20

law he would be.

21

Justice Kagan pointed out, the actions here

22

were even more unreasonable.

23

why we would -­

24
25

Obviously, I think, as

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the reason

I -- I don't

disagree with you, but I'm asking a question,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

which is:

Police can search a car when they

2

have probable cause, correct?

3

MR. FEIGIN:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
And they're free

5

to do that of any car driven even by a licensed

6

driver, correct?

7

MR. FEIGIN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Yes.
Or a licensed

co-driver on a rental agreement.

So really the

10

issue here before us is when are the police

11

permitted to search without a warrant, without

12

probable cause?

13

issue as, because if we rule that someone

14

without permission can -- has no expectation of

15

privacy even when the renter has given it to

16

them, then what we're authorizing is the police

17

to stop every rental car and search every

18

rental car, without probable cause, that might

19

be on the road.

20

And that's what I see the

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

21

there's no evidence that there's a widespread

22

practice of that because for one thing it's

23

impractical.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the police

here said we stopped him because he was driving

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

a rental car.

He was doing something totally

2

illegal.

3

put your hands at a 10 to 2 angle, and they

4

found that suspicious.

Every driving school teaches you to

5

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And they waited

7

until he made a turn that was not authorized by

8

the traffic laws.

9

So to say that there isn't a practice

10

is a little bit disingenuous, Mr. Feigin.

11

the question I really have is should we be

12

creating exceptions to the most basic of Fourth

13

Amendment rights, that of probable cause,

14

before police intrude in searching at all?

15

But

And we're doing it under the guise,

16

not of was this search legal under the Fourth

17

Amendment, but whether someone has standing to

18

even question that.

19
20

Because this is a standing case,
correct?

21

MR. FEIGIN:

It's -- it refers to a

22

doctrine the Court has sometimes referred to as

23

standing.

24

standing case is whether someone has the right

25

under the Fourth Amendment to treat something

And, of course, the question in any

as their own effect or their own home.

relying on -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Their own effect.

5

Well, we know that he was told that he could

6

use the trunk and put things in it, whether

7

he's a passenger or a driver.

8

that and the owner of -- and the renter of the

9

car agrees with him, I'm still not sure what's

10

missing.

11

MR. FEIGIN:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

Once he says

Your Honor -­
Why that claim of

an interest is inadequate.
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, let me say a couple

15

of things, Your Honor.

16

quite -- quite clear that a passenger doesn't

17

get rights in the trunk of a car.

18

putting items in the trunk of a car, even with

19

the permission of someone else, doesn't give

20

one rights in the trunk.

21

First of all, Rakas was

And simply

The person may have rights in their

own items within the trunk, but they don't have

rights in the trunk itself.

pretty big connection that the person who has

-- I've got that point.

MR. FEIGIN:

Okay.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, what do you

24

think of the -- of the rule that we just sort

25

of came up with maybe, or maybe he's been

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

advancing it, look, the problem with your rule,

2

it seems to me, is that there are cars, houses,

3

apartments, sublets, summer cabins, all kinds

4

of things which have all kinds of contracts,

5

understandings, leases, et cetera.

6

And over a wide range, who knows

7

what's in them?

And what can be expected?

8

That's awfully complicated.

9

I'm looking for something simple.

And, therefore,
And the

10

simplest thing that we were discussing, it

11

seemed to me, is to say the following:

12

the individual has all the other indicia of the

13

right to control the -- and fill in the

14

blank -- here it's a car, he's sitting there

15

driving it, that he can assert a right to

16

privacy and has standing, unless it is

17

criminal, unless it is a crime.

18

Where

Now maybe here it was a crime, but

19

that would be the rule, unless he is a criminal

20

possessor, unless he came in as a squatter

21

having broken the window, et cetera.

22

see the point?

23

MR. FEIGIN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Do you

Well -­
But the virtue of

what he just said, it seemed to me, your -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

your opponent here, was that that's pretty

2

simple, comparatively speaking.

3

think?

4

MR. FEIGIN:

What do you

I don't think -- I don't

5

think that's going to be particularly simple,

6

Your Honor.

7

mentioning to the Chief Justice, in some

8

jurisdictions, this would be a criminal act.

9

Second, I don't know what that rule

First of all, as I was just

10

does with cases -- and I'm not making this case

11

up, there's actually a petition before this

12

Court that presents this very question where,

13

for example, you have an unauthorized driver

14

who also has a suspended driver's license.

15

Simply getting into the car and turning the key

16

is a criminal act.

17

doing that.

18

They're not allowed to be

And yet I take it their rule would

19

create a legitimate expectation of privacy in

20

that circumstance.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, because it's a

22

crime for him to be there, and so, therefore,

23

he falls within the exception.

24

MR. FEIGIN:

25

So, Your Honor, I think

it's going to actually wind up being much more

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

difficult to apply in practice, and I don't

2

think it makes a particular amount of sense.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you suggest

4

as a rule?

You suggest as a rule that what we

5

look to see is under the law, as we've heard,

6

it could extend back to the 18th Century, et

7

cetera, under -- under the law of bailments and

8

a lot of other things, does this person have

9

the legal right to be in that particular place

10

where he is doing those things he's doing at

11

the time, which are relevant to appearance of

12

ownership?

we'd propose resolves this case, and I don't

the assertion of Fourth Amendment rights comes

Justice Alito that that can't possibly be your

test because there are all kinds of provisions

them.

7

And you would never say that that

So here you have a case where somebody

8

is in possession and control of the car.

That

9

person has been given permission by the renter

10

to be in possession and control of the car.

11

It's true that there's a contract violation,

12

but the contract violation, let's be frank, is

13

not uncommon.

14

these contract violations are foreseeable.

-- and it's understood by everybody as relating

to insurance liability, not to privacy.

Some courts have even said that

up the car of a door and sitting in the front

question is very much related to mine, because

there are all kinds of contract terms where if

11

you're in violation of the contract.

Why does this

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Feigin, you keep

2

saying that, but as a matter of property law

3

now and forever, a possessor would have a right

4

to exclude other people but for those with

5

better title.

6

So someone in these position would

7

have a right, I think you'd agree, to exclude

8

someone who's attempting to get in the car to

9

hijack it, carjack it.

10

You'd also have a right to throw out a

11

hitchhiker who had overstayed his welcome.

12

so as -- I think you're having to argue that

13

the government has a special license that

14

doesn't exist for any other stranger to the

15

car.

And

I don't think so, Your

Honor.

I don't think this Court has included

18

the idea that even the illegitimate possessor

19

of an item maybe having some sort of trespass

action they could bring has incorporated that

particular rule into the Fourth Amendment.

of the contract that excludes him from its

He's depending to some

He just wants to ignore the part

If I could get back to Justice Alito's

7

question, I think the key distinction between

8

this particular breach and other kinds of

9

breaches, if you were a legitimate renter, is

10

precisely that.

11

within the scope of the relationship.

12

legitimate renter who is driving the car and

13

then violates some term of the rental agreement

14

still has a legitimate connection to the car

15

everyone -- that everyone agreed was created in

16

the first place.

17

He's simply not included
A

And the question then becomes whether

18

they lose their legitimate expectation of

19

privacy based on that breach.

20

there's two good reasons why they wouldn't.

21

And I think

One is even when a contract declares

22

the agreement to be void upon the violation of

23

a particular term, courts construe that not to

24

have the contract immediately vanish into thin

25

air but, rather, to create a right of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

voidability in the party whose term has been

2

breached.

3

And so I think we would all understand

4

that if someone gets on their cell phone while

5

they're driving a rental car, even if they're

6

not supposed to, unless and until Budget

7

actually tries to dispossess the renter of the

8

car, that the agreement continues in force.

9

Second, even if that were not true, I

10

think there are some legitimate societal

11

understandings that might kick in at that

12

point.

13

late returning the car, I think everyone

14

understands that when you get there an hour

15

late, you're going to pay Avis the money for

16

the car, they're going to treat the contract as

17

though it continued, they may charge you a late

18

fee, but they're not going to act as though you

19

should have turned into a pumpkin and vanished

20

from the car the instant the clock struck noon.

21

If you're stuck in traffic and you're

JUSTICE ALITO:

And then what do you

22

do about the cases with the -- the illegal

23

sublessee or the individuals who occupy a

24

rental unit in violation of a provision that

25

specifies the maximum number of people who can

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1
2

stay there?
MR. FEIGIN:

So I think there probably

3

would be a legitimate expectation of privacy in

4

those cases.

5

this one in two key respects.

6

And I think they're distinct from

One is this Court has made crystal

7

clear that homes are different from cars under

8

the Fourth Amendment.

9

other is a house.

One is an effect; the

The Court has made clear

10

that homes are at the core of the Fourth

11

Amendment, yet cars have dramatically reduced

12

expectations of privacy because they move and

13

are subject to regulation.

14

The second thing is I don't think in

15

the subletting example or the example of having

16

too many occupants in -- in an apartment, for

17

example -- and this is getting back to some of

18

Justice Sotomayor's questions -- in those -- in

19

those cases, you don't have the clear,

20

well-established legal norm that you have in

21

this case.

22

And you don't have to believe me on

23

what the legal norm is.

If you look at the

24

amicus brief on their side from the National

25

Motorists Association at Footnote 2, they say

How important

7

is it -- how important is it that -- that the

10

important in these types of cases is the

11

ability to give clear guidance, not only to the

12

courts, but to the police who have pulled a car

13

over in the middle of a situation -- that is

14

the most dangerous situation they confront.

17

mean, maybe it's paradoxical; you think, well,

20

absence of the authorization on the rental

agreement that the police can look at is

22

evidence that, you know, this is not your

MR. FEIGIN:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12
13

So I think -­
And you're saying same

rule?
MR. FEIGIN:

I think we would say same

14

rule, and one of the reasons why -- I think the

15

Court could draw the distinction, but there

16

would be a couple reasons I would urge the

17

Court not to draw that distinction.

18

One is that it would give more privacy

19

rights to someone who is not diligent than to

20

someone who is.

21

am I on the rental agreement would have -- be

22

less likely to have privacy protections.

23
24
25

So someone who actually asks

The second thing is that it creates
very difficult proof problems.
The defendant gets on the stand and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

says, well, my friend said so and so.

That's

2

very difficult for the government to disprove.

3

And there it also raises questions of

4

trustworthiness.

trusting your friend.

Well, maybe your friend is a

Maybe your friend is just not a
You shouldn't have been

And the Fourth Amendment doesn't have

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about when

they -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If I understand -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

the -- became an authorized driver by lying, I

16

don't have a criminal conviction, and he's

17

listed, what happens then?

18

of the contract sufficient enough to invalidate

19

his expectation of privacy?

20

MR. FEIGIN:

Is that a violation

I think it probably

21

would, Your Honor, because he procured the

22

contract through lying.

MR. FEIGIN:

The Fourth

Amendment -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know you don't,

but I -- I -­

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, maybe I'll add

15

something to that assertion, which is that the

16

reason I don't think that's the right way to

17

think about that is because the Fourth

18

Amendment doesn't just protect people's

19

expectations of privacy writ large, it protects

20

persons in their houses and their effects.

21

And so, if -- for someone to claim -­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, Mr. Feigin,

23

the rule you want us to write in this opinion

24

is, if you are an unauthorized driver of a

25

rental car, even if you have permission of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

authorized driver, the police can search the

2

trunk without any probable cause?

3

MR. FEIGIN:

I would phrase it as the

4

-- you do not have enough of a connection to

5

the car to treat it as -­

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

bottom line is the one I announced.

8
9

Yeah, but the

MR. FEIGIN:

-- your effect for

purposes of the Fourth Amendment.

10

That would be the effect of the rule.

11

I would add that there are other Fourth

12

Amendment protections that protect against what

13

Your Honor is proposing.

14

First of all, you need reasonable

15

suspicion both to stop the car and for the

16

entire duration of the search.

17

He hasn't challenged the duration of

18

the search and the -- sorry, the duration of

19

the stop.

20

the stop in this case because I -- presumably,

21

because he would lose because there was

22

reasonable suspicion that supports the entire

23

length of the stop here.

He hasn't challenged the duration of

24

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

25

MR. FEIGIN:

Mr. Feigin.

Yeah?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

One thing we're

2

struggling with here is you say some contract

3

terms are so common, kind of an empirical

4

argument, that we should take cognizance of

5

them.

6

On the other hand, you kind of make a

7

normative argument that some contract terms we

8

should disregard even if they are common, like

9

the cell phone breach.

Listening to a cell

10

phone while driving shouldn't forfeit your

11

expectations of privacy as a normative matter,

12

even though, empirically, they're quite common.

13

The government's been living with the

14

reasonable expectation of privacy test for a

15

long time.

How much of it is supposed to be

16

empirical?

How much of it is supposed to be

17

normative?

And how are we supposed to decide?

18

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, if -- if you

19

don't mind, if I could just take the first part

20

of your question first.

21

that's quite our position.

I don't think that

22

Our position isn't about normative,

23

empirical data about how common a particular

24

contract term is.

25

As I -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You -- you've made

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

several times this argument that it's very

2

common, that anyone in the country would know

3

that this is a breach, and that that,

4

therefore, informs the reasonable expectation

5

of privacy test.

6

That's an empirical claim.

You've also normatively made the

7

argument that there are some breaches, though

8

common, we should not take cognizance of, we

9

should not forfeit Fourth Amendment rights on,

10
11

like the cell phone example.
And I'm asking you, the government's

12

been living with the Katz rule for 50 years.

13

How much of it's empirical, how much of it's

14

normative, and how are we supposed to decide?

15
16
17
18

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, I'll get to

that in just one minute.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, if you could get

to that straight away.

19

MR. FEIGIN:

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. FEIGIN:

Okay.

Sure.

And then I -- I'd

22

appreciate just being able to clear up what our

23

position is here.

24
25

We are not asking the Court to reject
the Katz rule.

The Court recognized -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I know that.

I'm

not asking you that either, Mr. Feigin.
MR. FEIGIN:

Yeah.

In reasonable

4

expectations of privacy, I think is a very

5

difficult inquiry for a court to undertake and

6

a court should be very hesitant before deciding

7

that some social understanding is sufficiently

8

well-embedded in society that it justifies

9

constitutional protection under the Fourth

10

Amendment.

11

Where you have the kind of empirical

12

or common sense data you have here, where the

13

assertion is in derogation of the established

14

legal norms of a major commercial industry, I

15

don't think that societal understandings, to

16

the extent they even exist at all, can really

17

carry the day.

18

But to get back to the sort of premise

19

of your question, we're not saying that certain

20

contract terms should be respected and certain

21

contract terms shouldn't.

22

we're drawing here is between somebody who

23

actually has a legitimate connection to the car

24

25

is an authorized driver of the car is someone

privacy.

MR. FEIGIN:

I think the answer there

15

would be no for two reasons.

16

think that's really what's going on in this

case.

of all, there's no connection to the owner of

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. LOEB

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MR. LOEB:

Thank you, Your Honor.

23

The government says that Mr. Byrd's

24

conduct would violate criminal law in Ohio.

25

That is not true, as explained in Footnote 2 of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1

our -- of our reply brief.

2

was where the renter who gave him permission,

3

allegedly gave him permission, is the one who

4

reported the car as stolen.

5

very different than here.

6

The case they cited

That's certainly

As to clear rules, our -- our -- our

7

position here is a clear rule in one -- one of

8

two ways.

9

One, that unless it's a criminal

10

trespass, or a stolen car, there is a ability

11

to at least invoke the Fourth Amendment or,

12

second, if anyone has a right to bring a

13

trespass action to exclude others and sue them

14

if they trespass on the property, they should

15

have an expectation of privacy protected by the

16

Fourth Amendment and ability to invoke it.

17

The -- the rule the government posits

18

here is one picking and choosing between

19

contract terms.

20

lists all these terms, including the

21

unauthorized driver, the cell phone, the

22

driving on gravel.

23

voidable.

24

but some of them we should treat differently.

25

You're picking and choosing between contract

The online standard contract

All of them they say it's

He says some of them are voidable,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

provisions, that is a complicated rule which

2

makes no sense.

3

The same kind of logic would lead

4

application to the subletter, for some reason

5

he says that homes and apartments should be

6

different.

7

bright-line rule that unless you're a criminal

8

trespasser, unless you're a car thief, that you

9

have at least the ability to invoke the -- the

10

This Court should adopt a clear,

Fourth Amendment.

11

He makes a distinction between homes

12

and cars.

13

which are regarding the nature of a car.

14

has never said the question of who can invoke

15

Fourth Amendment rights turns on whether you're

16

a person who's present in a house or present in

17

a car.

18
19
20

This Court has drawn distinctions
It

This is a unique argument which this
Court should reject.
JUSTICE ALITO:

What about other

21

criminal activity?

So why do you draw a line

22

between a criminal trespasser and somebody who

23

has an open -- an open bottle of alcohol in the

24

car, or someone who gets in the car intoxicated

25

or someone who is ingesting other control -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71
1

controlled substances in the car?

2

MR. LOEB:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

doesn't have a license.

5

MR. LOEB:

Because Rakas and -­
Or somebody who

Rakas, and the Court before

6

it in Jones, talked about wrongful presence in

7

the car and gave the example in the Rakas

8

footnotes of the car thief and -- and the

9

criminal trespasser.

10

So what's different about those crimes

11

is those are crimes where your mere presence in

12

the car is criminal itself and you're -- you're

13

intruding upon someone else's privacy and

14

dispossessing them of their privacy interests

15

by your criminal presence in the car.

16

There's other examples.

Often we have

17

cars being used to transport drugs, we have

18

examples of people going over speed limits,

19

people drinking in cars.

20

Those kind of criminal offenses have

21

never been considered as a basis for negating

22

the driver's right to simply invoke the Fourth

23

Amendment.

24

reasonable suspicion, is there a basis for

25

probable cause to search the car.

There's a question then is there

And that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

should be the standard here, not -- not finding

to invoke the Fourth Amendment at all.
