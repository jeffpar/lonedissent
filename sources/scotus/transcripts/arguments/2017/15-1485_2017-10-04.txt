the District of Columbia versus Wesby.

Mr. Kim.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD KIM

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. KIM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

Probable cause is a practical

12

standard, and thus it accounts for the

13

practical limitations that officers face when

14

making arrest decisions, including their

15

inability to look directly into the minds of

16

suspects offering innocent explanations for

17

suspicious conduct.

18

this one, what the actus reus established and

19

circumstantial evidence of mens rea that is

20

strong or at least fair, arrest is reasonable,

21

and hence constitutional, and more clearly

22

qualified immunity applies.

23

And so, in a case like

Let's turn to the totality of the

24

circumstances and consider them from the

25

correct perspective.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kim, before you

2

do that, could you clarify the other charges

3

that are in this case, the one relating to

4

disorderly conduct and negligent supervision?

5

Where do they stand?

6

affected by the argument you're making today?

7

MR. KIM:

And are they in any way

We do not pursue an argument

8

that probable cause existed for disorderly

9

conduct.

As to negligent supervision, that

10

common law claim fails if there was either

11

probable cause or qualified immunity.

12

where they stand, Your Honor.

13

That's

If I may turn back to the totality of

14

the circumstances, my clients responded to

15

neighbors' complaints about -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

sure I understood what you just said.

18

we hold on qualified immunity grounds or

19

probable cause grounds, I don't think it

20

affects those claims, does it?

21
22

MR. KIM:

I'm sorry, I'm not
Whether

No, that's right, Your

Honor.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why would our

24

finding of probable cause affect it?

25

those stand on their own, don't they?

I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

MR. KIM:

No, Your Honor, if -- if

2

there was probable cause, the negligent

3

supervision would fail as a matter of law.

4

That was undisputed in the courts below, and

5

it's undisputed in this Court.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

your adversary answer that.

8

MR. KIM:

9

So my clients responded to a

10

neighbor's complaints about illegal activities

11

in a house in their residential community that

12

was supposed to be vacant.

13

of late-night partiers, none of whom claimed

14

any right over the home.

15

Hughes, confirmed -­

16

Well, we'll let

Thank you, Your Honor.

They found a group

The homeowner, Mr.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, why

17

isn't there a right?

Someone invites me into

18

what they claim is their home or their place of

19

living.

20

Isn't that an invitation?
MR. KIM:

Yes, there was a claim of

21

invitation, Your Honor.

I was referring to the

22

absence of any claim of any property right over

23

the home.

But, yes, there was -­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. KIM:

But I don't -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- have a property
right when I get invited into someone's home.

3

MR. KIM:

To be sure, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't ask to

5

look at their lease.

6

them to establish, to my satisfaction or anyone

7

else's, their right to be there.

8

they're there, they can invite me in.

9

MR. KIM:

I don't ask to -- for

I assume if

Your Honor, we're not

10

suggesting that there has to be some type of

11

confirmation by any party guest of the

12

inviter's right to invite.

13

instead is from the officer's perspective,

14

looking at the totality of the circumstances,

15

there was a fair probability that Respondents

16

were trespassing either knowingly or

17

negligently.

18

a partygoer needs to confirm an invitation.

19

This is from the officer's perspective.

20

What we're saying

This is not about whether or not

If he has the fair probability of

21

guilt necessary to arrest, a prosecutor later

22

can decide whether to press charges, but there

23

was that fair probability here based on the

24

totality of the circumstances.

25

So the homeowner had confirmed no one

He had not been

2

there to guard against the partygoers' entry,

3

and the house appeared vacant.

Yeah, but then, when the

7

see with their own eyes that the house was

manner that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -­

I mean, the -- I am

told, perhaps I shouldn't take this into

10

account, but compared to the Middle Ages with

11

which I am more familiar -­

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- the -- the people

14

today, younger people frequently say, hey,

15

there's a party at Joe's house.

16

know it, 50 people go to Joe's house.

17

all -- they don't really ask themselves does

18

Joe own the house or rent the house or

19

something.

20

assumption would be it's Joe's house.

21

nobody questions it.

22
23

It's Joe's house.

And before you
And they

But the normal
And

So what's the evidence here that's
different from that?

24

MR. KIM:

Well -­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because I -- if I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

11
1

just think that's what happened, hey, there's a

2

party at Joe's house, I would think the people

3

who went over there, whether they knew Joe,

4

heard it secondhand, thirdhand or whatever, are

5

normally naturally going to think that Joe has

6

a right to the house.

7
8

Okay.

But here this is different than that
because?

9

MR. KIM:

For two reasons, Your Honor.

10

First, if I take your hypothetical correctly,

11

Joe had the authority to throw the party.

12

there's that -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, but I'm not

14

talking about Joe's authority.

15

about what the partygoers think.

16

MR. KIM:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

So

I'm talking

Absolutely, Your Honor.
When they hear

18

there's a party -- I don't want to repeat

19

myself -- I'm saying what -- what I would

20

assume is the normal thought in the partygoer's

21

house is no more than just what I said.

22

There's a party at Joe's house.

23

Period.

24
25

Let's go.

Now, in my mind, that doesn't give any
reason whatsoever for thinking that this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

12
1

partygoer suspects, knows, or believes that it

2

isn't Joe's house that he has some right to.

3

So you -- I want you to tell me what's

4

different about this case.

5

MR. KIM:

6

What's different about this case are

Absolutely, Your Honor.

7

these facts:

First, it was a house that was

8

supposed to be vacant and looked vacant.

9

it was a house where the -- the owner said that

10

no one had permission.

11

the purported hosts -­

12

And

It was a house where

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, I know that,

13

but now put yourself in the mind of the -- of

14

the partygoer.

15

thinking about the partygoer.

16

the policeman knows, the policeman knows, and

17

maybe Peaches knows, call her Joe, it wasn't

18

Joe's house.

19

The policeman has to be
So one thing is

Now, all right, that's one thing, so I

20

have to ask myself, is that a reason for

21

thinking the partygoer knew it or did anybody

22

think the partygoer knew it.

23

Okay.

24

MR. KIM:

25

What's the second?
Well, the absence of the

supposed host, Joe or Peaches, you can name

however you want, the host wasn't even there.

authority over the house -­

6

MR. KIM:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. KIM:

There were illegal

9

activities happening there or so the officers

10

reasonably could think of the type typically

11

associated -­

12
13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was it -- may I

stop you there?

14

MR. KIM:

Yes, Your Honor.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Didn't the person

16

who extended the invitation, Peaches, hadn't

17

she been there and she said she left to go to

18

the store, but she had been there?

19

MR. KIM:

Your Honor, there was

20

evidence that she told Officer Parker that she

21

had gone to the store.

22

themselves did not say that, notably.

23

simply said in response to the question where

24

is Peaches, she's not here.

25

The partygoers

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

They

I'm trying to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

14

2

3

fact, Peaches didn't have a right to be in the

4

house.

Two, that, in

Okay.

5

Anything else?

I want to have a

6

complete list of the things that make it

7

different.

8
9

MR. KIM:

Yes, Your Honor.

Peaches was not there.

Number 3,

Number 4, partygoers

10

acted suspiciously in response to the police

11

presence.

12

very suspiciously when asked sensible questions

13

like:

14

one answered those questions according to the

15

-- the depositions.

They fled and hid and they acted

Who's the owner?

Who lives here?

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. KIM:

No

Okay.

And I don't think we should

18

discount the fact that Peaches proved herself

19

to be quite evasive, untrustworthy.

20

repeatedly hung up on the police when they

21

tried to investigate.

22

back to the scene she would be arrested.

23

she eventually admitted trespassing herself.

24
25

She

She said if she came

Given all the circumstances, the
police -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

that's it, nothing else?

3

MR. KIM:

That's it, though,

There is more, Your Honor.

4

I could keep on going.

The actus reus itself I

5

think can be used here as a basis to infer the

6

necessary mens rea.

7

either knowledge or negligence, even assuming

8

the partygoers actually relied upon an

9

invitation from Peaches, and even assuming they

Let's remember, it's

10

actually believed she had the permission to

11

invite them, if their actual reliance was

12

negligent, that, nonetheless, was criminal

13

trespass in the District of Columbia.

14

So the Court of Appeals here, in what

15

I think is an impractical approach for what's

16

supposed to be a practical standard, said that

17

the officers basically had to heighten their

18

understanding of the credibility of -- of the

19

partygoers' clear invitation and Peaches'

20

supposed corroboration.

21
22

We don't think that's what police
officers are required to do on the scene.

23

Suspects on the scene offer any number

24

of different types of innocent explanations for

25

conduct.

These will often be false.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Kim, why

weren't any of these partygoers arrested?

smelled marijuana, but, as I understand it, no

drugs were found, correct?

8

MR. KIM:

For

The evidence is that no

drugs were found, that's right, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

any other.

12

suspected of engaging in sex arrested?

13

weren't the people standing around the

14

strippers arrested for those activities, if

15

they were illegal?

16

Why weren't the people who were

MR. KIM:

entry.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Kim, could you

7

tell me a little bit about how you think the

8

summary judgment posture of this case does or

9

doesn't matter?

I mean, usually in summary

10

judgment cases, we say we need to view the

11

facts in the light most favorable to the

12

non-moving party.

13

And many of these facts, you could see

14

it one way or you could see it another way.

15

has one explanation or it has another

16

explanation.

17

It

So how does the summary judgment

18

standard fit with the probable cause standard

19

and also with the qualified immunity standard?

20

How do those three things work together here?

21

MR. KIM:

Thank you, Your Honor.

22

I think the essential facts were

23

undisputed until Respondent's brief on the

24

merits.

25

come too late for reasons I'm happy to discuss.

Their attempts to dispute those facts

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

18
1

The inferences to be drawn from those

2

established facts are for the Court, and

3

probable cause to be determined as a matter of

4

law.

5

The Court puts itself in the shoes of

6

the officer and thinks:

7

the officer to arrest based on these facts?

8

And, of course, if there are inferences drawn

9

from the police officers, the Court will defer

10

Was it reasonable for

to those inferences.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

-- you said you were happy to discuss the

13

reasons that the -- the -- the disputed facts

14

come too late.

15

What are the

What are those?

MR. KIM:

Because it was inappropriate

16

for the respondents to wait even in their cert

17

papers to raise these disputes and it was -- it

18

is inappropriate for them to ask this Court to

19

be the first Court to parse the record closely

20

to consider these claims of dispute.

21

These disputes were -­

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why -- why would -­

23

why would they be asking that?

I mean, one

24

thing is their motion for summary judgment,

25

which was successful.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

19
1

But why would you be entitled to

2

summary judgment in view of the disputed facts

3

that they claim now?

4

MR. KIM:

Because, Your Honor, their

5

disputes are waived or forfeited.

They should

6

have been raised before, and especially in the

7

brief in opposition before this Court decided

8

in its discretion to grant cert on the two

9

questions presented.

10

Moreover, I would note that even if

11

you took the facts that are undisputed, even

12

now, and added them with the facts stated

13

directly in the questions presented, that would

14

be sufficient to establish probable cause as a

15

matter of law.

16

No matter how you would want to take

17

the inferences in the light most favorable to

18

the Respondents, it wouldn't matter here

19

because, again, the inferences are for the

20

Court and the established facts establish

21

probable cause.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -­

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So they -­

they didn't dispute the central facts in their

brief in opposition?

MR. KIM:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

That's right.
Facts that

were laid out in the petition for cert?

4

MR. KIM:

That's right, Your Honor.

5

In fact, they affirmatively agreed to what we

6

think is the most central fact.

7

sentence in the brief in opposition says that

8

this case is about, among other things, what

9

happens when the owner has indicated to the

10

police that he has not given permission.

11
12

The first

They now attempt to dispute that.

And

it's too late for them to do so, Your Honor.

13

So, if you actually look at the

14

totality of the circumstances and you allow the

15

officers to use their common sense, this Court

16

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. PARKER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

9
10
11

MR. PARKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
There are two fundamental errors in

12

the way that the lower courts analyzed the

13

question of probable cause in this case.

14

First, they took certain important

15

facts out of context, viewed them in isolation,

16

and engaged in precisely the sort of

17

divide-and-conquer analysis that this Court has

18

said is inappropriate.

19

And the second is they concluded that

20

because those facts were susceptible to

21

possible innocent explanations, they could not

22

contribute to a finding of probable cause.

23

Neither of those is correct.

When

24

police officers encounter a criminal suspect,

25

they are required to draw fair inferences from

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

23
1

the entire constellation of facts, drawing on

2

practical and commonsense experience.

3

facts will rarely be clear and often they will

4

point in different directions.

5

Those

And when they do, this Court has said

6

repeatedly that the possibility of competing

7

inferences supports, not undermines, a finding

8

of probable cause.

9

the case of mens rea, which is not directly

That is especially true in

10

knowable.

11

the head of the criminal suspect and know

12

exactly what he or she is thinking.

13

The police officer cannot peer into

And just like juries and judges must

14

rely on all of the surrounding circumstances to

15

infer what the mental state is, certainly

16

police officers should be permitted to do so

17

under the less exacting requirements of

18

probable cause.

19

This case presents a very good example

20

of why these principles are appropriate.

21

-- I want to be very clear at the outset what

22

we are not saying.

23

And I

We are not saying that no one can

24

accept a secondhand invitation to a party or

25

that they cannot go to a party at the home of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

24
1

somebody they don't know or that, when they

2

arrive, they have to inspect the lease to

3

ensure that the person has authority to invite

4

them.

5

All we are saying is that if a person

6

finds himself or herself in a compromising

7

situation -- here, finding themselves in a

8

vacant home that actually is vacant -- where

9

they, as a matter of fact, are an intruder who

10

is committing the actus reus of a crime, and

11

especially if there are surrounding

12

circumstances that would lead a reasonable

13

observer to think that that may be what really

14

is going on, then the deck is stacked against

15

that person.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

You are saying that

17

anytime a policeman goes into a house and

18

there's a party and people tell you, somebody

19

invited me, and it turns out that that somebody

20

didn't have a right to be in the house, you can

21

arrest them?

22
23

MR. PARKER:

No, I'm not -- I'm not

saying that.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. PARKER:

You're not?

No.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then what else is

there here than that?

3

MR. PARKER:

Well -­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, sorry, there is

5

one other thing.

6

isn't -- it's sparsely furnished.

7

you see a sparsely furnished house with some

8

people in it and they say word got around that

9

Joe invited everybody to his house for a party,

10

it turns out that Joe hadn't rented the house,

11

you can arrest them.

12

saying?

13
14

17

So whenever

Isn't that what you're

MR. PARKER:

It is not what I'm

saying, and I think -­

15
16

The other thing is that it

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Then why isn't

it?
MR. PARKER:

Well, because -- there

18

are two answers.

One is that, I think, would

19

be precisely the kind of bright-line rule that

20

this Court has repeatedly said is not to be

21

imposed in probable cause cases.

22

instead is required is an analysis of the

23

totality of the circumstances to determine

24

whether the statement of a -- or the claim of

25

an innocent mental state is -­

What I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

26
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm saying what else

2

is there here?

3

And maybe it's a question of believability,

4

then let's have a trial?

5

And I don't see anything else.

MR. PARKER:

Well, let -- let me -­

6

let me talk about the facts of this case, if I

7

can turn to that.

8
9

I think it's useful to think of this
almost as like two sides of a ledger.

On one

10

side, there's the condition of the home.

11

the other side, there's the statements of the

12

people who were there.

13

On

If you think about the condition of

14

the home, the police were responding to a -- a

15

citizen complaint, multiple citizen complaints,

16

that this was a vacant home.

17

vacant home, but they said that it had been

18

repeatedly exploited to throw parties in the

19

past.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not only was it a

But the story of

21

the -- of Peaches, who extended the invitation,

22

was that she had just leased the house.

23

somebody had just leased a house, the sparse

furnishing would not be at -- at all

25

incriminating.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So, if

MR. PARKER:

I -- I think that that is

2

a perfectly permissible inference from the

3

facts that you described, Justice Ginsburg.

4

think our only point is it is not the only

5

permissible inference based on the totality of

6

the facts here.

7

In addition to the tip that they

8

received, when the officers arrived, they

9

noticed that the -- the condition of the home

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

that?

If all it had, according to you, was a

18

bed and some folding chairs and utilities that

19

worked, nothing had been turned off, what

20

happens during a party?

21

MR. PARKER:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23
24
25

Well -­
Disarray?

So what

was different in this disarray from a party?
MR. PARKER:

Well, the -- the evidence

in the record indicates that the house was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

28
1

considerably more dirty than just an ordinary

2

house.

3

went to the house said that the floor was so

4

dirty, she was unwilling to sit on it.

5

was trash strewn about.

6

contraceptives strewn about.

In fact, one of the individuals who

There

There were used

7

I think that all of those things would

8

lead a reasonable officer to think that perhaps

9

these are just particularly messy houseguests,

10

but this is also consistent with the type of

11

party people would throw in a vacant house

12

where they're not too concerned about the state

13

that they leave it in.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

MR. PARKER:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Parker -­

Yes.
-- you know, you're

17

exactly right, that, of course, we have to view

18

this through the eyes of the officer.

19

there is much that an officer could look at

20

here and say, I think I have probable cause.

21

And, certainly, when the qualified immunity

22

standard is laid on top of that, makes it even

23

easier for the officer.

24
25

And

I guess one of the things that -- that
strikes me as why there's resistance here, is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

29
1

that when looked at from the point of view of

2

the reasonable partygoer, it looks a little bit

3

different.

4

that's not the standard, but we are setting

5

rules and those rules are going to affect how

6

police officers act in the future as well.

And I -- I take the point that

7

And when looked at from the reasonable

8

partygoer's view, there are these parties that,

9

once long ago, I used to be invited to -­

10

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- where you didn't -­

12

don't know the host, but you know Joe is having

13

a party.

14

marijuana was maybe present at those parties?

15

And, you know, so -- and, you know, it just is

16

not obvious that the reasonable partygoer is

17

supposed to walk into this apartment and say:

18

Got to get out of here.

19

And can I say that long, long ago,

And -- and it seems a little bit hard

20

that they're subject to arrest.

21

do I think about that question?

22
23
24
25

MR. PARKER:

So -- so how

Well, I -- I think there

are a couple of ways.
I think the overarching point here is
that, as I said, when a partygoer goes to a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

30
1

house, if it turns out that it actually is

2

vacant and that they actually are intruding,

3

the police, upon encountering that situation -­

4
5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right, but they don't

know that, as I said.

6

MR. PARKER:

That's right.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, from the

8

partygoers' point of view, they just know that

9

Joe is having a big party, and it's a good

10

time, and -- and maybe there will be some

11

liquor and maybe there will be some

12

recreational drugs.

13

a good time.

14

And -- and they're having

MR. PARKER:

I -- I think that that's

15

an entirely possible inference to draw, but

16

it's not the only inference.

17

there are a number of facts that suggest that

18

that, in fact, was not what was happening.

19

And I think here

It's not just that the house looked

20

vacant and that people who were reasonably on

21

the scene would -- would be able to observe

22

that this looks like a situation where we

23

should not be; it's that when they were asked

24

about it, the individuals said nothing to

25

dispel probable cause.

If anything, they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

31
1

reinforced it.

2

It wasn't just that none of them lived

3

there; none of them knew who lived there.

They

4

also -- when asked who invited you, almost all

5

of them said somebody else.

6

reflect whether they named any particular

7

person, but we do know that only two of the

8

individuals on the scene, it appears at least,

9

named Peaches.

The record doesn't

And those were two of the young

10

women who had been hired to come dance at this

11

party.

12

themselves.

13

They were not the actual partygoers

When Peaches was -- was called, she,

14

as -- as Mr. Kim explained earlier, was

15

evasive.

16

that she had authority to throw a party there,

17

and she didn't.

18

would fit into a reasonable officer's

19

understanding of the facts and suggest that

20

they may be hearing a story that is not true,

21

both from the partygoers and from Peaches.

22

She lied to the officers.

She said

All of those things, I think,

And certainly I think that when police

23

arrive at a scene and see the actus reus of a

24

crime in the process of being committed, they

25

can at least reasonably intuit that the people

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

32
1

here probably know what they're doing.

2

That isn't always going to be able to

3

get you over the probable cause hump, because,

4

as I've said, this is not an area susceptible

5

to those sorts of bright-line rules, but at

6

least it's going to inform what a prudent

of skepticism when dealing -- may I complete?

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Court should affirm the grant of

21

Respondents' summary judgment motion.

22

Respondents uniformly told police they had been

23

invited to a party.

24

their statements and the owner of the house

25

confirmed the host was not some stranger.

The host corroborated

Heritage Reporting Corporation

She

Official

33
1

had been involved in lease negotiations that

2

ultimately fell through.

3

Petitioners now maintain that there

4

was probable cause to arrest because the party

5

was raucous and involved stripping and drinking

6

and marijuana smoke, but those activities don't

7

put a partygoer on notice that the host has

8

failed -­

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there

10

was a lot more involved that the Petitioner is

11

relying on than those things that you just

12

listed.

13

that weren't limited to the fact that it was a

14

raucous party.

15

He went through six different items

MR. GARRETT:

So there was also the

16

fact that Peaches was absent.

Justice

17

Ginsburg, you were correct that Peaches was at

18

the party.

19

they arrive and she has left.

That's undisputed at JA 43.

Then

20

Does a partygoer who arrives at a

21

party where the host is there and then she

22

leaves know he should not be there, after she

23

was there when he arrived?

24
25

They also mentioned disarray, and the
-- and the status of the home.

I think, in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

34
1

fact, the status of the home is generally

2

undisputed in terms of what was there.

3

many things were left out, so let me explain

4

them.

5

And

The bed, the chairs, which were not

6

folding chairs -- you can see that from the

7

pictures in the record -- the stereo, the

8

utilities were on.

9

utility bills.

Somebody was paying the

coverings.

There was

There were window

There was shower curtains.

12

So they say it was vacant, but it's

13

certainly not vacant under the definition of

14

D.C. law.

15

certainly wasn't vacant.

16

well, when the people arrived, the condition of

17

the house was such that they should have

18

realized they're not supposed to be there.

19
20
21

D.C. law defines vacant.

It

So they must mean,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does it matter

that the tips they had said that it was vacant?
MR. GARRETT:

Well, the tip, I think

22

the tip is hard to sort of decipher.

We've got

23

the police report at 1:12 where there are two

24

tipsters named Keck and Foster.

And we don't

distinguish between them.

2
3

Three pieces of information given:
Vacant, illegal activity, loud music.

Oddly, Mr. Keck comes in at summary

5

judgment and files an affidavit that seems

6

quite different from that.

7

used to be vacant; about a month ago I started

8

seeing people using the house.

9

He actually says it

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The important

10

thing I suppose would be what the officers were

11

told and whether it was reasonable for them to

12

act on what they were told.

13

MR. GARRETT:

And it certainly was

14

reasonable for them to act, Chief Justice

Roberts.

16

the Petitioners maintained in the District

17

Court -- certainly at that point when the tip

comes in they have suspicion.

the house, investigate what's going on, which

20

they did.

We don't dispute -- and this is what

They can go to

21

The question is then what develops

22

into probable cause for unlawful entry and,

23

most importantly, what is the evidence that

24

these individuals knew that they weren't

25

supposed to be here or at least were negligent

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

36

2

in not knowing them?
JUSTICE ALITO:

What should the

3

officers have done after they had made all

4

their inquiries at the house?

5

MR. GARRETT:

I think there are

6

several things they could have done here,

7

Justice Alito.

8
9

Number 1, they now had information
from the owner that he didn't want them there.

10

They immediately could have asked the

11

individuals or ordered the individuals to leave

12

and, if they hadn't, that's unlawful entry.

13

They could arrest.

14

They could have issued a citation for

15

disorderly conduct which likely would not have

16

raised Fourth Amendment concerns at all.

17

could have investigated, as they now maintain,

18

they smelled marijuana smoke.

19

suggestion that one officer heard about

20

prostitution.

21

investigated those crimes.

22

They

There's a

Well, they certainly could have

I think it's interesting, or at least

23

telling, that under Devenpeck they could have

24

come in here at any time and say we arrested

25

for unlawful entry, but really we had probable

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

37
1

cause for other things, whether it's

2

disorderly conduct, marijuana, narcotics,

3

prostitution.

4

They've abandoned the disorderly

5

conduct justification and they've never

6

suggested they had probable cause to arrest

7

anybody for the other crimes.

8

--

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think the

The key things that I

10

hadn't fully taken in, one, you put yourself in

11

the position of the officer.

12

you this is a vacant house.

13

Two, people tell

So it is known, i.e., they knew, I

14

guess there's some evidence of this, that there

15

were vacant houses in this area used for

16

parties.

17

They know also that it is a vacant

18

house.

19

things that -- and then they look around and it

20

looks sort of vacant, not completely, but sort

21

of.

22

And it doesn't -- and those are the

And so that together leads them to

23

think, well, these people knew it was a vacant

24

house.

25

MR. GARRETT:

But -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

38

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -- and would a

2

reasonable officer have concluded that the

3

partygoers knew or they knew it was a vacant

4

house?

If so, that's enough.

5

MR. GARRETT:

6

7

Because it is

trespass to go into a vacant house, I gather.

8
9

And -­

MR. GARRETT:

No, it's not, Your

Honor.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not?

Well, but

11

the other stuff they have, I guess, isn't it?

12

Vacant -- you can't -- it isn't trespassing in

13

the District of Columbia to go into a vacant

14

house?

15
16

MR. GARRETT:
Honor.

No, it's not, Your

In fact, if a house -­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. GARRETT:

What if -- go ahead.

Well, if a house is

19

actually vacant -- I mean, this is the oddity

20

of how this argument comes up -- if a house is

21

actually vacant or abandoned, it's not

22

trespassing because somebody is not maintaining

23

their control over it.

24

It is prima facie evidence of trespass

25

if somebody's in a vacant house that is boarded

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

39
1

up or otherwise secured in a manner that

2

conveys it's not to be entered.

3

I think one fact that was not talked

4

about here is that there was no evidence of

5

boarding up and there's no evidence of forced

6

entry.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, when those tips

8

-- when the people nearby called it and they

9

said the house is vacant, you think they were

10

referring to the technicalities of District of

11

Columbia law?

Don't you think they meant -­

12

MR. GARRETT:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

No.
-- that nobody was

living there?

15

MR. GARRETT:

That's correct, Your

16

Honor.

17

question arises:

18

have reason or did they know that it was

19

supposed to be vacant?

20

I do think that's right.

And then the

These partygoers, did they

Now, the host had told both -- she

The

2

status of the home is that a partygoer going to

the home would not infer, simply because of its

condition, there must be something wrong with

the host title.

So, our point on the -- on the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the fact of what

you just mentioned is troubling to me.

it's a low-income neighborhood.

You say

And I just wonder, if we moved all of

these facts to an affluent community, and what

11

the neighbors said when they called the police

12

is, you know, our neighbor, Joe, who is the CEO

13

14

officer in a big company, has been transferred

MR. GARRETT:

5

Well, I think it would

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why would it be a

closer case?

6

MR. GARRETT:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Because -­
I mean, is the

8

expectation, well, this is a low-income

9

neighborhood; we don't care what goes on here?

10

MR. GARRETT:

Oh, quite the opposite.

11

The point is that we're looking at this from a

12

police officer's commonsense perspective.

13

And certainly it seems like

14

commonsense that, if you're in River Terrace,

15

the condition -- the facts that the home

16

doesn't look the same as it might in Northwest

17

D.C. is something the police ought to take into

18

consideration.

19

I -­

JUSTICE BREYER:
I'm sorry that it is.

This is important to

20

me.

21

In fact, the house under D.C. law wasn't

22

vacant?

23

MR. GARRETT:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

I didn't know this.

No, Your Honor.
And, indeed, if the

officers -- which is unlikely -- had known all

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

42
1

these details, they would have known it's not

2

vacant.

3

by the person who supposedly invited them to

4

the party.

What it is, is not owned by or rented

5

MR. GARRETT:

Correct.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -­

So then the question

7

becomes did -- would a reasonable officer have

8

believed that they were trespassing and they

9

were trespassing if and only if there is some

10

reason a reasonable person could have believed

11

that they knew that the person who invited

12

them, first, second or thirdhand, did not have

13

a right to be there?

14

MR. GARRETT:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16
17

Correct.
And there's -- you

think there's nothing to have a trial about?
MR. GARRETT:

Oh, I -- well, so let me

18

-- let me maybe use that question as a

19

transition to Justice Kagan's question about

20

the differing standards of review in the

21

different motions.

22

So, both parties filed motions for

23

summary judgment.

24

make sure I talk about the waiver issue.

25

And -- and I want to also

So if, if the Court is reviewing our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

43
1

motion and asking whether to reverse that

2

motion, the facts are construed in the

3

District's favor.

4

If the Court is reviewing should it

5

direct entry of judgment for Petitioners, then

6

you would construe the facts in our favor.

7

Now, there was some discussion of, well, have

8

we waived this distinction, and let me explain

9

why that's not the case.

10

In their petition, the Petitioners

11

asked for reversal of liability findings at

12

pages 16 and 25.

13

in their favor.

14

brief that they very clearly said not only

15

should you reverse their motion, you should

16

grant ours.

17

And they construed the facts
It wasn't until their merits

They also say:

disputed some of these facts below.

Well, I

19

encourage the Court to look at JA 186, which is

22

facts they rely on here.

They never mention five of the seven

And our rule,

not challenge the factual assertions in the

petition, you're bound by those assertions.

3

The reason is that we make a judgment

about whether to take a case based on the cert

papers.

pertinent facts on which Mr. Kim has relied.

are historical facts that they asserted.

that.

MR. GARRETT:

And on -- on

Again, I'm not sure I -­

24

I could have much to add, other than if the

25

question is whether we're reviewing our motion,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

we do take those facts as true.

2

But they clearly -- Petitioners

3

clearly know how to say we want a directed

4

judgment in our favor.

5

it in the petition.

6

simply I think it ought to be at least

7

unambiguous if they're going to change relief,

8

in their merits brief, they ought to have made

9

that clear at the petition stage because there

And they didn't ask for

And -- and my point is

10

are two different motions.

11

necessarily enter summary judgment for them

12

even if the Court's inclined to reverse our

13

motion.

14

And you don't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but I do

15

think, again, under our rules, in reviewing

16

either motion, you take the facts as they

17

asserted in the petition that you either

18

accepted or did not rebut.

19

MR. GARRETT:

And -- and we don't

20

dispute those facts in the context of our

21

motion.

22

they're relying on are cases where the facts

23

end up mooting -- the waiver cases end up

24

mooting the legal question.

25

to moot any legal question.

And I would also note the cases

We're not asking

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

46
1

The point is they've now extended in

2

their merits brief the scope of this case from

3

our motion to their motion.

4

responding to that.

5

And so we're

And as I was saying earlier, the -­

6

the reason these facts weren't disputed below

7

is because in the district court, Petitioners'

8

theory was that this was a summary -- a strict

9

liability crime, and so they didn't rely on

10

anything having to do with facts that would

11

have put Respondents on notice, because their

12

position was that's irrelevant.

13

As soon as we talked to the owner and

14

he says you're not allowed to be here, game

15

over, they're liable for trespass.

16

it's now that they're actually asking the Court

17

to enter judgment on a different summary

18

judgment motion than the one they actually

19

filed in the district court.

20

So it's -­

One might ask what other evidence they

21

could have looked for.

22

asked, what else could they have done?

23

might also ask what else could the police have

24

looked for as evidence of mens rea?

25

One of -- Justice Alito
One

And I think looking at the cases cited

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

47
1

in this case, you see a number of examples that

2

were absent here.

3

which you see in several cases like Kozlovska,

4

where the owner tells police these individuals

5

knew they weren't supposed to be in the house.

6

We don't have that.

7

evidence like forced entry, where somebody has

8

to force their way into the house because it's

9

not theirs and they're trying to get into a

10

One is direct evidence,

There's circumstantial

house.

11

Here, of course, the evidence, as it

12

turned out, is that the host had keys.

13

there was no forced entry.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so

They were -­
Here, we've -­

15

we've been talking about probable cause up

16

until now, but there's also the qualified

17

immunity question, and this Court has said that

18

there's no liability on the part of the officer

19

unless he or she knowingly violated the law or

20

was plainly incompetent.

21
22

So can you explain how you cross that
hurdle?

23

MR. GARRETT:

Yes.

Yes, Justice

24

Ginsburg.

Our position is that these officers

25

were plainly incompetent in disregarding

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

48
1

evidence of the partygoers' state of mind.

2

It's not a subjective standard.

3

Nonetheless, multiple officers testified they

4

witnessed nothing that would have put these

5

partygoers on notice that they weren't supposed

6

to be here, which I think speaks to what an

7

objectively reasonable officer would have

8

believed.

9

they believed it was a strict liability crime.

10

And our contention is that the -- the

Of course, they arrested because

11

facts that have been mentioned, flight, which I

12

-- which I do want to address, drugs,

13

prostitution -- our point is that none of this

14

is evidence of the mens rea element.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Garrett, as

16

you say, it is an objective standard.

And

17

there are all these cases in the District of

18

Columbia; Tillman is the one that gets the most

19

emphasis in the briefs, but there are others,

20

right?

21

Bowman.

22

court cases, say if they upheld convictions,

23

they upheld convictions for trespass, even

24

though the person gave some excuse about how

25

they didn't know or they didn't -- or they -­

There's this Artisst, Smith, McGloin,
And all of these cases, which are D.C.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

49
1

and they -- and they shouldn't -- they had no

2

reason to know that they were there.

3

And I'm -- I'm just wondering, you're

4

a D.C. police officer and there are all these

5

cases that say, you know, we're going to uphold

6

convictions even though people like the

7

partygoers here have -- get up on the stand and

8

say:

9

here.

This is why I thought I had a right to be

11

And, you know, what is a police
officer supposed to make of all that law?

12

MR. GARRETT:

Well, I think what they

13

make of that law -- and I want to make one

14

clarification.

15

unlawful entry statute.

16

statute.

Tillman is not actually an
It was a different

17

But I think what they make -­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19
20

Are all the others

unlawful entry statutes?
MR. GARRETT:

Yes.

And I think what

21

they make of that is where somebody enters a

22

residence where the will of the owner has been

23

expressed, you don't have to accept a suspect's

24

explanation.

25

In Artisst, there was a sign saying

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

50
1

you must register.

2

McGloin, he was in an obviously restricted

3

area.

4

because that is a case where the crime was

5

knowingly entering the paid area of a Metro

6

station, and the reasoning was you walked past

7

the tills, you walked through a door; we can

8

infer from the act itself that you knew what -­

9

what you were doing.

10

He didn't register.

In

Tillman, I think, is a different case

But, again, the difference I think is

11

in all those cases, there's a sign, there's

12

some indication that puts these -- these

13

suspects on notice, I'm not supposed to be

14

here.

15

of the -- the difference in this case.

16

obviously arguing about what were the

17

inferences they could have drawn from things

18

like stripping and -- and marijuana, but it's

19

-- it's certainly very different than a sign

20

outside a -- a building saying don't come in

21

here unless you register.

22

And that, I think, is -- is -- is sort

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We're

conduct a mass arrest of 21 individuals, you

7

require some individualized suspicion.

If they wanted to

If they wanted to arrest for

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I do

I thought -- I

10

thought I recalled from the Petitioners' brief

11

that the police interviewed every one of the

12

people at the party.

13

MR. GARRETT:

Well, I -- I don't think

14

that's clear.

15

judgment papers that everyone said they were

16

invited to a bachelor party, so I suppose you

17

could infer from that they talked to everybody,

19

shows is specific officers saying:

20

a handful of people.

Petitioners say in their summary

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. GARRETT:
Your Honor.

That's not accurate,

I -- and I don't -- but, to be

10

fair, I don't think that was the

11

representation.

12

that we have limited depositions that were used

13

at summary judgment.

14

where the person states who invited them, and

15

in both cases, they state it was the hostess.

I think the representation was

MR. GARRETT:

I don't recall.

I'm

sorry.
I do want to talk just briefly about

4

the imputation point.

not -- Petitioners aren't seeking to justify

6

the arrest of 21 individuals on the basis of

7

individualized suspicion.

8

reliance on Pringle and the common -- and

9

imputing mens rea from one to the other.

10

Again, the -- they're

There's been a

I just want to make sure I touch on

11

that because I think Pringle is a very

12

different case from this -- from this case.

13

In Pringle, there were three

14

individuals in a car at 3:00 in the morning and

15

the Court reasoned that one person was

16

certainly involved in narcotics activity.

17

And because of that, the -- the

18

officers could infer everybody was because you

19

wouldn't be in a car at 3:00 in the morning

20

with two others, two other innocent people.

21

I don't think that logic works here,

22

simply because the hostess implicated herself,

23

made a statement against interest, and

24

essentially admitted she was liable for

25

criminal trespass.

It doesn't necessarily

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

54

follow that she told everybody else that.

2

I think that singling out is also the

3

difference between Pringle.

4

And

Peaches essentially explained that she

5

was the reason for the unlawful entry.

6

told people that they were invited.

7

according to Petitioners, that she hadn't

14

well, you can still infer that the other 20

knew about it.

The

And Petitioners are now saying,

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Garrett, I just

17

wanted to get back to Justice Alito's question

18

because, as I understood it, you -- you agreed

19

that it would be acceptable for an officer to

20

make this arrest in a more affluent part of

21

town.

22

And maybe I'm mistaken in that, but

23

because perhaps the furniture situation one

24

should understand would be less in this area of

25

town than that area of town.

But if it's a new

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

55

tenant, we all live with folding chairs for a

2

period of time when we move.

3

So does that hold?

Is that a fair

4

reason?

5

distinguish between parts of town in deciding

6

when to make an arrest?

7

Should officers really have to

MR. GARRETT:

I'm sorry if I misspoke,

8

Justice Gorsuch.

I'm not trying to argue for

9

some sort of bright line rule between

10

low-income and high-income properties.

11

saying the Court has repeatedly said you look

12

at this from a commonsense perspective.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. GARRETT:

redline where he enforces the law?

So does

considerations that could be taken into account

Heritage Reporting Corporation

in the condition of a property.

2

was going to make a concession, the concession

3

would be there are certainly situations where

4

the condition of the home will be enough.

I think if I

So, Petitioners cite examples,

6

real-world examples, where there's a big

7

mansion, it's empty because it's being sold,

8

and there's a For Sale sign out front.

9

Now, when the police show up to a

10

teenage party, they obviously have probable

11

cause to arrest at that point because the For

12

Sale sign, the condition of the house, gives

13

you at least some evidence that -­

4

come upon evidence -­

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Shouldn't I worry

6

that you think it's a closer case, that

7

officers implicitly may distinguish, and you

8

suggest should, based on where in town they're

9

enforcing the law?

10

MR. GARRETT:

Well, I think -- I think

11

the contrary rule would be very odd.

12

it would be very odd for police to take into

13

account certain commonsense considerations

14

sometimes, but ignore the fact that this woman

15

has said she's just moved in or you're in a

16

low-income neighborhood and disregard that.

I think police are on the ground, they

know their neighborhoods, and that kind of

commonsense consideration should -- should play

into account.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD KIM

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. KIM:

8

10

Justice.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

I have just a few points.
First, just to clear things up -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Kim, I don't

11

know if I agree completely with your opposing

12

counsel that the wealth of the neighborhood

13

should make a difference, but I suspect that if

14

police officers arrived at a wealthy home and

15

it was white teenagers having a party, and one

16

of them says, "my dad just bought this house,"

17

that it would be very -- and I told the kids

18

they could have a party, and it became, Joe

19

told me to come, and Larry King told me to

20

come, and X King told me to come, that those

21

kids wouldn't be arrested.

22

lied might be, but I doubt very much those kids

23

would be arrested.

24

MR. KIM:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Maybe the kid who

Well, Your Honor -­
So, how is this

case different?

Same set of facts:

Sparsely

2

furnished, even a little bit dirty, lights are

3

on, that sort of thing.

4

So shouldn't we have a rule that if

5

we're going to require mens rea at all, that

6

police officers should be treating people

7

equally?

8
9

MR. KIM:

Absolutely police officers

should treat people equally.

My clients take

10

very seriously their obligation to do so.

11

there is no selective enforcement claim in this

12

case, and with good reason.

13
14

And

The officers took their time here,
investigated very thoroughly.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This -­
Twenty one people

16

en masse arrested for trespassing for going to

17

a party.

18

Does that feel right?
MR. KIM:

Yes, Your Honor, because,

19

first, they were responding to a community

20

complaint.

21

this very seriously.

22

vacant home in their community.

23
24
25

The community, this community, took
It was an abuse of a

The officers appropriately took that
seriously.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Peaches had keys.

MR. KIM:

We don't know that -­

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If those

3

partygoers -- well, we know there wasn't forced

4

entry.

5

MR. KIM:

There is no evidence of

6

forced entry for sure, Your Honor.

7

know that the officers thought that Peaches had

8

keys.

9

We don't

But going back to your question, this

10

was a vacant home, in the sense that no one was

11

living there.

12

Columbia law sense.

13

Not in any technical District of

Neighbors had reported this house

14

wasn't supposed to have anybody living there.

15

And that's the type of home that trespassers

16

can target in houses in any socioeconomic

17

status.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Kim, you

19

got up and said you had a few points.

20

you want to run through those?

21

MR. KIM:

Yes, Your Honor.

What do

First just

22

to clean up.

The fact that everyone was

23

interviewed was in our petition on page 3 and

24

supported by the record in multiple spots,

25

including page 131 of the Joint Appendix.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

63

As to whether or not this -- the

2

question of competing motions for summary

3

judgment is properly before the Court at this

4

point, it's not just that they didn't raise the

5

disputes.

6

brief in opposition this is the factual

7

background.

8
9

They affirmatively said in their

And if you look again at page 1 of
their brief in opposition, they agree as to the

10

essential factor that the owner had not given

11

permission.

12

There was also waiver in the Court of

13

Appeals below.

14

the Circuit says here are the essential

15

undisputed facts.

16

about that.

17

Pages 3 to 4 of their brief in

It quotes the trial court

And, finally, I just need to close

18

with the reminder both questions, both

19

questions here, need to be considered from the

20

perspective of the on-scene officers who were

21

trying to do their jobs that night.

22

We put ourselves in their shoes, and

23

ask whether what they did was reasonable or at

24

least arguably reasonable.

25

They investigated thoroughly.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

They

had much evidence, circumstantial, but much

evidence as to either knowing or at least

negligent trespass.

did was reasonable or at least arguably so.

Given all that, what they

They did not have to think that
Peaches was the only trespasser that night.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Kim, realizing

8

that this is not the legal question before us,

9

I'm just curious as to what your answer is.

10

If you were giving counsel to the

11

Police Department, and they said in a situation

12

like this what should we do, a very different

13

question from the legal question before us, but

14

what would be the answer to that question?

15

MR. KIM:

I think it's difficult.

And

16

it really depends on the totality of the

17

circumstances, just like the Fourth Amendment

18

question does.

19
20
21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

These -- these -- it's

these circumstances.
MR. KIM:

I think community policing

22

is a fraught endeavor with many competing

23

pressures and many competing responsibilities.

24

I am not an expert in that.

25

I would

not -- I would not endeavor, especially in this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

forum, to -- to answer that question.

2

But, again, what we're being asked

3

here is not whether what the officers did

4

was -- was the right decision.

5

arguments why it was.

6

we're going to set a nationwide floor that

7

officers may not arrest in circumstances like

8

these.
