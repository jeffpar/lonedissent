Mr. Perlin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ASHER PERLIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. PERLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In 2008, Congress comprehensively

12

overhauled the terrorism exception to foreign

13

sovereign immunity to close gaps that had for

14

years allowed foreign terror states to thumb

15

their noses at U.S. judgments finding them

16

liable for acts of terrorism while their

17

victims were drawn into a long, bitter, and

18

often futile search for scarce assets that

19

would be subject to execution under the

20

exceedingly narrow commercial exception to

21

foreign sovereign immunity.

22

The centerpiece of that legislation is

23

Section 1610(g).

That provision provides that

24

American terrorism victims can execute their

25

judgments upon the property of a foreign state

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

that is subject -- against which a -- a

2

judgment has been entered under 1605A, and it

3

makes available the property of the state's

4

agencies and instrumentalities.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

If -- if -­
Well -­

As provided in the

section.

MR. PERLIN:

As provided in this

10

section.

11

that provision means.

12

13

the word "execution" and the words "as provided

14

in this section."

15

that the property is subject to execution upon

16

that judgment as provided in this section.

The Respondents would

What it actually says is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We know what -­

18

that -- that Congress wanted to do away with

19

what they call the Bancec factors, and this

20

statute was written perfectly to do just that.

21

You say it does something more.

22
23

MR. PERLIN:
Honor.

25

It has to do more, Your

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And why does it

What the statute did is it made more

assets available because you didn't have to

3

instrumentality of the state, an agency.

5

available.

6

The

So it swelled the assets that would be

7

available.

But it didn't say anything, not a

8

word, about immunity.

9

MR. PERLIN:

10

two questions there.

11

about immunity, but those are magic words.

12

does say that the property is subject to

13

execution.

14
15

Well, there -- there's
It doesn't say anything

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It

Magic words under

(a) and (b).

16

MR. PERLIN:

I'm sorry?

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In 1610 in (a) and

18

(b), Congress knew how directly to say property

19

is not or is subject, immune from attachment.

20

But it used something very different here.

21

Rather, it says that property is, quote,

22

"subject to attachment as provided in this

23

section."

24

formulations.

25

Those are two very distinct

MR. PERLIN:

They are different.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

Subsections (a) and (b) were part of the

2

original Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act from

3

1976.

4

If you look at subsection (f)(1), which the

5

President has waived, it says "shall be subject

6

to execution."

There were other amendments since then.

7

The -- the Terrorism Risk Insurance

8

Act, which is codified as a note to subsection

9

-- to Section 1610, also says shall be subject

10

to execution to -- to execution.

11

language -- when Congress sat down to write

12

subsection (g), it was looking at the other

13

terrorism exceptions to execution immunity that

14

it had already passed, and those were (f) in

15

TRIA, and it modeled (g) after -- after those

16

sections.

JUSTICE BREYER:

On the uniform -- on

21

the uniforms that the people in the embassy

22

wear, on -- on the papers that the ambassador

23

keeps in his desk if, in fact, you read "as

24

provided in this section," the answer is no.

25

If you read it to include because it has to be

Under your reading,

where those words must mean something else,

4

MR. PERLIN:

They cannot.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. PERLIN:

Why not?

Subsection -- Section

7

1609 says that Section 1610 -- execution under

8

1610 is subject to international agreements

9

like the Vienna Convention which would protect

10

diplomatic property, and Section 1611 protects

11

military assets, certain central bank assets.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. PERLIN:

Okay.

Congress, when they

14

enacted 1610(g), they did not completely

15

abrogate foreign sovereign immunity for terror

16

states.

17

the victims, they wanted to punish and deter

18

the terror states, but at the same time,

19

Congress recognized that Iran and North Korea,

20

Syria, Sudan, these are sovereign states, and

21

they're entitled to a bare minimum of sovereign

22

immunity, and Congress retained that bare

23

minimum by protecting quintessentially

24

sovereign assets while making everything else

25

subject to execution.

remedies of 1605A, capital A, are very novel,

8

to say the least.

9

a private right of action anywhere else in the

10

Sovereign -- Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

11

You don't have any other provision that allows

12

punitive damages against a sovereign state,

13

which is a sure sign that Congress was not

14

concerned about affronting the dignity of

15

terror states.

16

The remedies -- remember, the

property that is subject to execution under

8

the 1605 judgment to this provision.

9

also -- there's -- there's no other way to read

And it

10

it.

If you read it as -- as the Respondents

11

would, there's no -- there's no provision

12

provision of 1610.

5

thought that the University of Chicago had

6

raised an interesting argument, that the

7

definition of foreign state in the statute

8

includes, by definition, an agency or

9

instrumentality of a foreign state, so that the

10

reference to foreign state that you're relying

11

upon does include the concept of piercing the

12

corporate veil in its very definition.

13

MR. PERLIN:

Well, that would -- that

14

would -- that itself would abrogate Bancec, the

15

rationale that University -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that -- not

17

quite, because what -- I mean, this provision

18

deals directly in aid of the plaintiffs in the

19

Bancec case and in the others that had found

20

against plaintiffs.

21

There are at least three cases where a

22

class of plaintiffs were found not to be in a

23

sufficiently tied relationship to the foreign

24

state and the plaintiffs there couldn't

25

recover, so there was a real issue this was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

addressing, the fact that there were

2

subsidiaries and agencies of foreign state who

3

had commercial property, and it wasn't being

21

agency or instrumentality's property.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, give an

23

example.

I mean, there's a famous example

24

which you probably know about, the -- the

25

letter of Cyrus, saying to everybody throughout

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13

the Middle East that the Jews are free and they

2

can go back to Israel, Palestine, the temple,

3

and that letter exists and Persia -- the

4

Persian letter, and Iran has sent it around the

5

world.

6

Now, in your view, they have -- and

7

people have looked at it.

And if it comes to

8

the United States, you can seize it.

9

-- that's your view of it?

Is that

Because if it is,

10

of course, if Congress knew about it, then they

11

12

the nature of the stuff in Chicago.

It -- Congress has addressed

immunity for culturally significant objects

provision that Congress did enact in -- and

20

we've been talking about (g) and so -- so this

21

is subsection (3), refers to "nothing ... shall

22

be construed to supersede the authority of a

court to prevent ... the impairment of an

24

interest held by a person who is not liable in

25

the action."

raised that as a defense.

And because Section

1610(g)(3) refers to a -- a party with an

11

ownership interest, not just a -- some other

12

intangible interest -- and -- and even to the

13

the House Report says that "although it

subjects to execution any property in which the

state has a beneficial -- beneficial interest,

22

it does not extend to diplomatic property."

23

So once Congress is excluding

24

specifically that narrow class of

25

quintessentially sovereign property, diplomatic

Heritage Reporting Corporation

25

property, you know that it's extending to -- it

2

covers everything else.

3

if it didn't cover commercial use property or

non- -- sorry, non-commercial use property,

5

there's no reason to specifically mention

6

diplomatic property because, obviously, that's

7

going to be included in non-commercial.

8
9

There's no reason -­

This applies to everything.
Everything except diplomatic, military, and

10

certain central bank assets.

11

that Congress would be concerned with

12

affronting the dignity of a state sponsor of

13

terrorism and would extend protection to their

non-commercial assets for that reason, to avoid

15

an affront to their dignity, is just

preposterous.

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

In your

14

brief, you offered several other

15

interpretations of the phrase "as provided in

17

different from the one -­

18

MR. PERLIN:

19

JUSTICE ALITO: -- you provided this

20
21

morning.

Yes.

Are you disavowing those now?
MR. PERLIN:

I think that the best

22

construction is that it refers to the judgment

23

entered under 1605A.

24

alternative constructions that are viable and

25

certainly more viable than the Seventh

I think that those are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

Circuit's.

2

Again, if you sit down and try to

3

think of cases where -- where the property of a

4

foreign state will have applicability -­

5

applicability under 1610(g) where it wouldn't

6

-- where this property wouldn't be subject to

7

execution under 1610(a)(7), right, according to

8

the Respondents' construction, you won't find

9

it.

You will not come up with a case or you're

10

going to have to work very, very hard and

11

there's no reason Congress would have included

12

-- if this were only meant to pierce a veil,

13

Congress would have said subject to subsection

14

(3), or paragraph (3), the property of an

15

agency or instrumentality of a foreign state

16

against which a judgment has been entered under

17

1605A is subject to execution -- to attachment

18

and execution.

19

It did not need to mention the

20

property of the foreign state.

Iran and the

21

government both talk about how it had to

22

mention the foreign state.

23

had to mention the foreign state because a

24

judgment was entered against the foreign state,

25

but it does not need to single out the property

Well, it's true, it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

of the foreign state, if all this were -- was a

2

veil-piercing mechanism.

3

It doesn't work.

It doesn't -- you

4

cannot pierce the veil of a company or a

5

country to reach the property the country owns

6

directly.

7

Now, let me just point out that none

8

of the other provisions of 1610 work with (g)

9

either.

(b), which the Seventh Circuit relied

10

on -- it said this section refers to subsection

11

-- really refers to subsections (a) and (b).

12

Subsection (b) applies only where there's a

13

judgment entered against the agency or

14

instrumentality.

15

If you have -- again, if you have a

16

judgment against the agency or instrumentality,

17

you don't need a veil-piercing mechanism to

18

reach it because you go after -- you go after

19

its property directly.

20

(c) is -- is -- specifically mentions

21

(a) and (b) only, that an execution referenced

22

under (a) and (b), and it doesn't mention (g).

23

And Congress could have amended it to include

24

executions under (g).

25

(d) is for prejudgment attachment

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

where there's an express waiver of immunity.

2

None of these provisions work.

I'm

3

going to -- I'd like to reserve the rest of my

4

time for rebuttal, but if you -- if you sit

5

down and try to -- they don't work.

6

doesn't -- there's no way to read it according

to the Seventh Circuit and -- and apply it.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13
14
15

MR. STRAUSS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Let me first pick up on a piece of the

16

legislative history that my friend quoted to

17

the Court.

18

precursor of what became 1610(g), did say that,

19

as -- as Mr. Perlin said, that the provision

20

was designed to eliminate many of the barriers

21

which are preventing U.S. citizens from

22

collecting on court-ordered damages.

23

said it does this by changing the legal

24

standard of the Bancec doctrine.

25

the way in which this exposed more assets -­

Senator Specter, who introduced the

He then

So that was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

more property to execution by terrorism

2

plaintiffs.

3

In fact, the Petitioners' position

4

about the construction of 1610(g) is wrong for

5

four independently sufficient reasons.

6

the language the Court has focused on, "as

7

provided in this section."

8

Section 1610, that is the section of which (g)

9

is a subsection.

One is

This section, is

So the phrase "as provided in

10

this section" means the Petitioners have to

11

satisfy the provisions of 1610, which means

12

that only property used for commercial activity

13

in the United States can be seized.

14

Petitioners, I think, have just not come up

15

with a plausible alternative account of what

16

"as provided in this section" means.

And

17

But there's a second reason.

18

has to do with the difference between

19

subsection (g) and the provisions of subsection

20

1610 that really do abrogate sovereign

21

immunity.

22

says, in Section 1609, that the property of

23

foreign states in the U.S. shall be immune from

24

attachment, except as provided in 1610.

25

And it

The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act

Then the subsections of 1610 say in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

terms one after another that certain property

2

shall not be immune.

3

as does (b), as does (d), as does (e).

4

Subsection (g) contains no such language.

5

relevant part of subsection (g) does not refer

6

to immunity at all.

7

Subsection (a) says that,

And there's a reason for that.

The

The

8

reason is that (g) is about Bancec, and the

9

Bancec doctrine is not an immunity doctrine.

10

The Court was very explicit about that in the

11

decision, the Bancec decision itself.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you do

13

think -- agree with him, don't you, that the

14

property of a foreign state in -- in (g)(1)

15

is a -- is a strong indication at least that it

16

is not limited to overturning the Bancec

17

decision?

18

MR. STRAUSS:

No, I -- I don't agree

19

with that, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

going on there is Congress wanted to make it

21

very clear that Bancec was no longer -- no

22

longer going to be a barrier in these cases.

23

I think what's

And so it said property of the state,

24

property of agencies, property of

25

instrumentalities, property of separate

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

juridical entities, interests in separate

2

juridical entities, all of these things are in

3

the same basket, and all of them are subject to

4

attachment and execution.

6

I think that's why you have that -­
that language in -- in (g)(1).

It's not a -­

10

But Bancec
It

cetera.
MR. STRAUSS:

It's -- it is -- that is

12

-- it's right that Bancec was not about the

13

property of a state itself, but the way the

14

section is written, property of a state

15

including property that is in a separate

16

juridical entity or is an interest held

17

directly or indirectly in a separate juridical

18

entity, what you see in the legislative history

19

is a lot of concern that state judgment debtors

20

would be arranging their assets in ways that

21

would distance themselves from ownership.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it the case there

23

on that particular point -- I was trying to

24

work out that does Bancec ever apply -- could

25

it apply to funds or -- yeah, funds of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

foreign state itself?

2

suggests it applies where the -- where the

3

foreign state deposits some money in a bank?

4

Is there anything that

And then they argue, we -- that isn't

5

our money, that's the bank's money, and we're

6

just the beneficial owner of that money.

7

Bancec might have said, yes, that's right, it's

8

not their money, it's an agency -- it's an

9

agent's money.

10
11

MR. STRAUSS:

14

I'll -- I'll say two

things to that, Justice -­

12
13

And

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about that

argument?
MR. STRAUSS:

-- Justice Breyer.

I

15

think the Bancec criteria are not very clear.

16

The Court deliberately left the criteria vague.

17

And I think Congress was concerned about that

18

situation.

19

And I think that's why you see this

20

language in (g)(1) that really tries to be

21

comprehensive and cover every base.

22

think you don't get out of (g)(1) is anything

23

about immunity because it even applies to

24

separate juridical entities who would have no

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

doesn't want them to cover everything in every

5

side is that the certain actions are, you know,

6

the ones in -- in -- don't include the ones

7

governing the property of the foreign state.

8
9

It's titled property in certain actions.

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, I think the

certain actions, Mr. Chief Justice, are actions

10

to execute judgments under 1605A.

12

14

This is a

property it's referring to.

16

was intended to make it much easier for

17

plaintiffs who have terrorism-based judgments

18

to get their hands on assets, but only those

19

plaintiffs.

20

and that's why a judgment entered under 1605A

21

-- but that doesn't mean that the rest of the

22

section does not apply.

The third is this:

The -- the statute that added

say to parties like Petitioners, who are

20

seeking to execute a 1605A judgment, must show

21

that the property they want to seize is used

22

for commercial activity of the United States.

23

That same statute said that.

inserting 1605A into subsection (a), which is a

subsection that requires commercial activity.

That statute then amended the FSIA to

3

It created 1605 -­

It said if you have a judge -- if you

4

are trying to execute a 1605A judgment, here is

5

how you do it.

6

subsection (a), subsection (a)(7) says you can

7

execute a 1605A judgment, provided you can show

8

that the property is used for commercial

9

activity in the United States.

That's what

that statute does.

Then the next provision -- or a few

lines later in the statute, really, it's not

15

would have it, Congress created this remedy,

provided that if you want to execute a judgment

based on this remedy, you go to subsection (a)

18

and you show that the property you're seizing

19

is used for commercial purpose -- commercial

activity in the United States.

And there's really a fourth reason as

different entities is subject to execution "as

The

20

was subject to execution, regardless of what is

22

right.

23

If it said that the property

And then so, second, I think another

24

thing that really drives home that they are

25

misreading this law is that the way they read

it, it gives with one hand what it takes away

2

with another.

3

So, as my brother was explaining,

4

Congress added (g) at the same time it added

5

(a)(7), and what (a)(7) says is that these very

6

same people, victims of terrorism with

7

judgments under 1605A, it says that they can

8

execute against the property of a foreign

9

state, but only if it's used in commercial

10

activity.

11

But the way they read (g), those

12

people can defeat that limitation just by

13

invoking a different subsection of the same

14

statute.

15

non-commercial property, whatever, and that's

16

just not a sensible way -­

They can get commercial,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know you're

saying it, but explain to me why.
MR. TRIPP:

Yes.

So the reason it's

not right, we explain this on pages 24 and 25

of our brief.

9

of 1605A itself.

10
11

It has to do with the language
This is on 12A of our gray

brief if you want to see it.
And what 1605A says is "The Court

12

shall hear a claim under this section if" and

13

then the prerequisites to jurisdiction are

14

satisfied.

15

jurisdiction and enters a judgment, it's a

16

judgment under 1605A, regardless of what cause

17

of action they happen to invoke.

18

So we think anytime a court gets

I also think this doesn't really move

19

the dial for them much because, in practice, in

20

the mine-run application of 1605A, when

21

somebody gets jurisdiction, they're also going

22

to use the cause of action.

23

As Petitioners were -- were

24

describing, it's very powerful, it's directly

25

on point, punitive damages, vicarious

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42

liability, and so it would still be true that,

2

in the mine-run application of (g), they would

3

be reading the law to give with one hand what

4

it takes away with the other.

5

And then the last thing I'd just like

6

to mention here is about the United States'

7

competing interests in this case.

8

obviously, we have a very strong interest in

9

combatting state-sponsored terrorism.

I mean,

We also

10

have concerns in these cases about the

11

reciprocal -- reciprocal treatment of our own

12

property abroad.

13

light of those concerns which are quite

14

weighty, if Congress was really going to take

15

the step of allowing execution against property

16

of a cultural and historic significance to

17

another country and its people, that would be a

18

big deal and it would not be the kind of thing

19

that you expect to see buried in a conforming

20

amendment without remark.

21

And I think, particularly in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, how about

22

the cases, the other cases he was talking

23

about, the ones with proceeds in the bank from

24

a commercial activity, et cetera?

25

His reading would take care of those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

rulings, wouldn't they?

2

MR. TRIPP:

I -- so I think one thing

3

about -- the way we read the statute too, I

4

think it does help to some extent with -- with

5

the breadth of the using commercial activity,

6

is that the way we read (g), once you -- if you

7

have a judgment against the foreign state, you

8

can pierce the veil down through to the agency

9

or instrumentality, and then you can go after

10

the agency or instrumentality's property under

11

(b)(3).

12

-- the property be used in commercial activity.

13

It's enough that the instrumentality is engaged

14

in commercial activity.

15
16
17

And (b)(3) does not require that the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you think those

other courts were wrong?
MR. TRIPP:

Those other -- I believe

18

the other decisions that he was talking about

19

were interpreted in (a)(7), not (b)(3).

20

-- but as we understand it, the statute works

21

together with -- with all of it.

22

1610, you can pierce the veil and use (a), (b),

23

the procedures in (c) would apply, (d) could

24

apply, (f) could apply if it weren't waived.

25

And so I think a natural way for Congress to

And so

It works -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

pick up all of those -- all of those procedures

2

was to say that the property is subject to

3

execution as provided in this section.

4

And so what Congress did was to tether

5

the extent of execution under this

6

veil-piercing provision to all the protections

7

that are already baked in elsewhere in 1610,

8

and those protections ensure that you can't

9

execute against the ancient Persian artifacts

10

like these.

11
12

So, if there's no further questions,
we're asking the Court to affirm.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ASHER PERLIN

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19

MR. PERLIN:

The first point I want to

20

make is that the -- the government and the

21

University claim that our reading would render

22

this -- would render subsections (a)(7) and

23

(b)(3) superfluous.

24

case.

25

That's -- that's not the

The private right of action under -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

under Section 1605A(c) applies only where the

2

plaintiffs are U.S. nationals, members of the

3

military, or government contractors or

4

employees.

5

The immunity waiver that's also in

6

1605A, but subsection (a), so 1605A(a), applies

7

where the claimant or the victim is a U.S.

8

national, a member of the military, or a

9

government employee or contractor.

10

It's a -- it applies to a broad -- it

11

-- the immunity waiver reaches a broader class

12

of plaintiffs.

13

1610(g) is limited to those who hold judgments

14

under 1605A, and this judgment that's available

15

under 1605A is a -- is the statutory judgment.

16

The remedy provided under

The provisions of 1610(a)(7) and

17

(b)(3) apply where the judgment relates to a

18

claim for which the foreign state is not immune

19

under 1605A, which is explicitly referring to

20

the immunity exception and it's explicitly

21

referring to the broader class of plaintiffs.

22

So we don't think that -- that there's -- there

23

is some overlap, but it does -- that does not

24

render (a) and (b) superfluous.

25

Second of all, (b), as Iran argues and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46

they argued below in -- in the Bennett case,

2

which is Case 16-334, I believe, there, there

3

was a case where VISA had collected money for

4

Bank Melli, a bank -- an Iranian bank, and was

5

holding it because -- because of the sanctions.

6

It could not return that -- it could not pay

7

that money out.

8

said we want to -- we want to enforce a

9

judgment against that money that VISA collected

Terrorism victims came and

10

11

interpleader action.

12

And VISA filed an

Iran defended, and they said you can't

13

-- you cannot enforce your judgment under

14

1610(b)(3) because that applies only where the

15

judgment is entered against the instrument -­

16

the agency or instrumentality, and Bank

17

Melli -- there's no judgment here.

18

Iran -- that's what Iran's argument was.

19

-- and, right -- Iran continues to maintain

20

that -- that it won't apply to (b)(3).

That's what
The

21

And I think that that's -- I mean,

22

that's -- you would have to say that -- you

23

would have to read out of (b)(3) the limitation

24

that you need a judgment against the agency or

25

instrumentality for it to apply to (b)(3).

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Again, there's -- there's no way to read this

2

through according to their construction, to

3

read it through and apply it.

4

Now, again, just to make clear the

5

point about the "as provided" -- "upon a

6

judgment as provided in this section," if you

7

look at the other substantive provisions of

8

1610, they allow -- let's start with -- let's

9

look at 1610(a).

The opening paragraph says

10

that the property of a foreign state "used for

11

... commercial activity in the United States,

12

shall not be immune from attachment ... or from

13

execution, upon a judgment entered by a court

14

of the United States."

15

Right?

There's "execution, upon a judgment"

16

and then words that modify the judgment.

18

structure.

19

Same

It's the exact same

Subsection (f), it's not the exact

20

same words, but it's the same structure again

21

that -- that the property is subject to

22

execution of any judgment relating to a claim

23

for which the state is not immune.

24

words following "judgment" are modifying the

25

word "judgment," which makes sense under the

Again, the

2

here because we're -- we're talking about a

3

particular judgment.

5

Section 1610(g) applies

The -- the word "execution" is

6

separated from that phrase by a comma.

The

7

words "upon that judgment as provided in this

8

section" do not contain a comma.

9

are meant to be read together, and the "as

Those words
