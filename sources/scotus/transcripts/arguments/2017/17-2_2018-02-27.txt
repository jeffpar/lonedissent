ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Section 2703 of the Stored

12

Communications Act focuses on classically

13

domestic conduct.

14

court order by the United States of information

15

related to a United States crime and, here, by

16

a United States service provider.

17

It requires disclosure in a

21

22

materials or, in the alternative, to ask the

23

source to do its own search and then turn the

24

materials over.

25

It's -- the disclosure here

The Act permits the government to

So why -- you describe it as if it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

only a disclosure, but it's really a search.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

So, Justice Sotomayor,

3

it -- it's a hybrid instrument that has two

4

functions.

5

directly on the provider.

6

provider to make disclosure of information.

7

That is a function that's classically performed

8

by a subpoena or a discovery order.

9

not authorize the government to go in, sit down

The first function operates
It requires a

It does

at Microsoft's facilities, put hands on

11

keyboards -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, actually, it

13

does.

14

provision, it's an -- an alternative for that,

15

meaning the provision provides for a warrant

16

that presumably would let the government do

17

just that if it chose.

18

If you read -- if you read the

MR. DREEBEN:

So, presumably, not

19

because the statute actually says that the

20

government can get a warrant requiring

21

disclosure.

22

case is an act on the provider.

23

fundamental distinction between a search and a

24

subpoena-type instrument is that in a search

25

the government does go right in and grab the

The act that -- that occurs in the
And the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

2

information.
In a subpoena context, the instrument

3

operates on a person and it places an

4

obligation on that person to make disclosure.

5

Once it gets to the government, once the

6

government has the account in hand, it executes

7

the warrant aspect of the order, which is a

8

probable-cause-based order, allowing the

9

government to search the account.

10

So it's essentially analogous to if

11

the government knew that an individual had a

12

laptop computer and it wanted to obtain that

13

computer and search it, it could serve a

14

subpoena on the individual, requiring the

15

production of the laptop.

16

Once the government gets the laptop

17

into its custody, it needs a search warrant to

18

get in and look at the information.

19

single order achieves both functions under a

20

statute whose structure and language makes

21

clear that it places disclosure obligations on

22

a provider and it then authorizes the

23

government to conduct the search.

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And here a

Mr. Dreeben -­
Mr. Dreeben, may I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

ask you a broader question?

I think the

2

starting point all would agree in, what was it,

3

1986, no one ever heard of clouds.

4

of storage didn't exist.

This kind

5

And there are good arguments that can

6

be made either way, but a court can say either

7

you are right, all right, or the other side is

8

all right, and there's nothing nuanced about

9

it.

If Congress takes a look at this,

10

realizing that much time and -- and innovation

11

has occurred since 1986, it can write a statute

12

that takes account of various interests.

13

it isn't just all or nothing.

14

And

So wouldn't it be wiser just to say

15

let's leave things as they are; if -- if

16

Congress wants to regulate in this brave new

17

world, it should do it?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg,

19

a couple of responses.

First, I agree that the

20

Court is construing a statute passed in 1986

21

and then amended subsequently.

22

the Court should leave things as they are with

23

the instrument that Congress authorized,

24

operating on a person, and requiring that

25

person to produce information regardless of

And we think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

whether it's stored overseas.
Microsoft here made a unilateral

3

decision to move information overseas.

4

in the law requires it.

5

prohibits it.

6

Nothing

Nothing in the law

What Congress did was act against a

7

backdrop of law dating back to this Court's

8

Societe Internationale versus Rogers decision

9

in 1958 and running through the Aerospatiale

10

decision in 1987, under which the basic rule of

11

both domestic and international law is that

12

when a court has personal jurisdiction over an

13

individual before the court and issues an order

14

requiring disclosure of information, that

15

person must comply with the order regardless of

16

where it has chosen to store the information

17

over which it has control.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In that sense, is it

19

-- is it correct to say that the parties agree

20

that the Act does not have extraterritorial

21

application?

22

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And is that just a

24

concession you make for purposes of this case,

25

or do you read the statute that way?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

MR. DREEBEN:

We read it against the

2

backdrop of this Court's decision in Morrison

3

and RJR, which provide that unless the statute

4

clearly has extraterritorial application in its

5

text, structure, or operation, it has none.

6

And we're not here arguing that this

7

application is extraterritorial and

8

permissible.

9

always been the rule from decisions in this

10

Court and decisions in the lower court in a

11

basically unbroken line that when a party is

12

before a U.S. court and a court issues an order

13

to that party that says produce information,

14

that's domestic conduct.

15

What we're saying is that it has

It's viewed as domestic conduct not

16

only in United States law reflected in this

17

Court's decisions; it's viewed as domestic

18

conduct in international law.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I mean, there are computers

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

And this Court has

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

a test for determining whether an application

2

of a statute that has some domestic conduct and

3

some foreign conduct is domestic or

4

extraterritorial.

5

And as Justice Alito put it for the

6

Court in the RJR opinion, one has to look at

7

the focus of the statute.

8

statute has domestic conduct in view, then it

9

is a domestic application of the statute,

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Dreeben, why

would that be the case using the focus test

15

that we wouldn't take cognizance of the fact

16

that the information must be collected abroad

17

and transmitted from abroad to the United

18

States before it could then be disclosed?

19

mean, there's a chain of activity that's

required here.

MR. DREEBEN:

Because I think the way

that the Court has approached this, Justice

statute and the actual text and try to identify

from that text what is the focus of the

15

I understand that,

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, it does, but -­

Is that -- is that your

Well, I think this

16

Court's case law provides a test that says that

17

if the activity that's within the focus of the

18

statute occurs in the United States, the fact

19

that there may be antecedent or other conduct

20

abroad doesn't detract from a domestic

21

application.

22

And I have an example that I think

23

will help illustrate that point.

Suppose that

24

a defendant in federal court were convicted and

25

ordered to pay a fine and the defendant said, I

8
9

It's not an

And that's the same that we're asking
to happen with the warrant.

In fact, the text

10

of the statute says nothing about

11

extraterritorial conduct.

12

How you

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Dreeben, I

13

don't know that you fairly answered Justice

14

Ginsburg's question.

15

This is a 1986 statute.

The reality

16

in 1986, if you look at the statute and its

17

reference to stored records, to stored

18

communications, was -- it's a past technology,

19

old concept.

20

back then they were thinking that where these

21

materials were stored had a geographic

22

existence in the United States, not abroad or

23

nowhere else, and that they were protecting the

24

communications that were stored in particular

25

locations.

But I think it's fair to say that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

Things have changed.

But what you're

2

asking us to do is to imagine what Congress

3

would have done or intended in a totally

4

different situation today.

5

that Justice Ginsburg alludes to is the fact

6

that, by doing so, we are trenching on the very

7

thing that our extraterritoriality doesn't want

8

to do, what our jurisprudence doesn't want to

9

do, which is to create international problems.

10

And the problem

Now I understand there's a bill that's

11

being proposed by bipartisan senators that

12

would give you most of what you want but with

13

great protections against foreign conflicts.

14

There are limitations involving records that

15

are stored abroad.

16

Why shouldn't we leave the status quo

17

as it is and let Congress pass a bill in this

new age -­

9

how much this conflicts.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

No foreign government

11

has come to this Court saying that the order

12

that we seek would conflict with its law.

13

State Department and the Office of

14

International Affairs in the Justice Department

15

have heard no complaints from foreign

16

governments about the way that we have

17

typically operated under 2703 for decades.

18

The

In fact, the complaints all run the

19

other way.

The complaints are that when

20

foreign governments need information from U.S.

21

providers, they come here under a Mutual Legal

22

Assistance Treaty, an MLAT, and they depend on

23

the United States pursuant to a statute to go

24

into court, invoke 35 -- 2703 and seek the

25

information from the provider wherever it may

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

be located.

2

And the Microsoft decision has caused

3

grave interference with our ability to help our

4

foreign law enforcement partners enforce their

5

own laws.

6

puts us out of compliance with our

7

international obligations.

8
9

It is -- the Microsoft decision also

The Budapest Cybercrime Treaty, which
is joined by over 50 nations, including most of

10

the European nations, requires courts to -- in

11

-- in particular jurisdictions to have the

12

authority to require providers to furnish

13

information in response to court requests

14

regardless of where the information is stored.

15

That's Section 18.1(a) of the Budapest

16

Convention.

17

is exactly what the government is arguing for,

18

and we are the ones who are really urging the

19

status quo.

So the international baseline here

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's assume

21

because there's been a lot of back and forth,

22

and I -- I tend to disagree, there's an open

23

question on the Budapest Treaty, but putting

24

that disagreement aside, assuming the point

I've made, there is a bill.

obligations of disclosure.

10

What a warrant does, if it's in its

So what are we supposed to make of

MR. DREEBEN:

I think what you make of

it is that the structure of the statute

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

provides three mechanisms for the government to

2

obtain disclosure:

3

order, which is the intermediate form of

4

process that's at issue in the Carpenter case;

5

and a warrant.

6

A subpoena; a 2703(d)

And those three different instruments

7

correlate with the different levels of

8

sensitivity of information that Congress

9

perceived, and, therefore, it ratcheted up the

10

showing that the government had to make in

11

order to get the disclosure order.

12

And so, instead of saying just go get

13

a warrant, it says get a warrant using the

14

procedures of Rule 41, not all of Rule 41.

15

territorial limitations of Rule 41 are not

16

incorporated into the statute.

17

statute has its own territorial provision which

18

provides for nationwide service of disclosure

orders.

The

In fact, the

And it goes on to specify that this

21

disclosure obligation applies regardless of the

22

instrument, be it subpoena, 2703, or a warrant.

23

It all falls on the provider to make

24

disclosure.

25

And I think that that's an important

Heritage Reporting Corporation

fact because, when you have an order to a

provider, it allows the provider to do what my

The government goes in and it

18

The grand jury subpoena, I think, is a

19

little bit of a more difficult question because

20

the question would be whether 2703 meant to

21

occupy the field in getting information from

22

providers or instead left us free to use grand

23

jury subpoenas in areas that aren't covered by

24

2703.

25

What is clear, I think, though, is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

23

that 2703 was meant to build on categories of

2

existing instruments, plus adding a new one of

3

Congress's own device.

is useful for us in certain circumstances for

the content of information under the way that

other question?

Are they doing that, or are

MR. DREEBEN:

Every district court

24

Heritage Reporting Corporation

continuing to compel information from service

providers, regardless of where they store it.

4

And in the case of providers like

Google, algorithms enable them to move

maximize the efficiency of their system.

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is happening when

12

these district courts outside of the Second

15

MR. DREEBEN:

The Internet

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see the problem, I

3

think, but what I don't see yet -- maybe I just

4

have to go back and study it -- is -- is your

5

answer to Justice Gorsuch's question, which has

6

been bothering me on both sides.

7

you on this, you know, but I look at the

8

language of the statute, and the statute says:

9

A government entity "may require the disclosure

They're with

10

by a provider of electronic communication ...

11

only pursuant to a warrant issued using the

12

procedures described in the Federal Rules of

Criminal Procedure."

Yes.

MR. DREEBEN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. DREEBEN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right?

Yes.
That's what it says.

Yes.
So then I go to the

20

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and there

21

the first thing I discover is you ask a

22

magistrate, and it says:

23

with authority in the district ... has

24

authority to issue a warrant to search for and

25

seize a person or property located within the

"A magistrate judge

that I can help clear up a little bit of this.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. DREEBEN:

Yeah.

Okay.

There are two angles of

21

it.

The most basic one is that the Stored

provision that allows the government to go to a

variety of places to get warrants.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Second

14

question is -- maybe it's not this case, but

15

what happens if you go to Microsoft and you

ask, say, some for -- for some bank records

17

that are in Italy, and, in fact, Italy does

have a law, we imagine, which says absolutely

no bank record can be taken by any other person

something.

is the answer?
MR. DREEBEN:

The answer is that

5

courts conduct a comity analysis.

6

the Restatement of Foreign Relations -­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

They look to

So the answer

8

is that, which many amici suggest to us, that

9

what should be done in such a case is you go to

10

the magistrate or the judge and you say, judge,

11

I want you to look at the factors of comity.

12

And one of them will be, if there is -­

what should be done, and this new law proposes

Heritage Reporting Corporation

that.

2
3

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think what's

more -­

4

-- radical is that

Microsoft's position is that no court ever gets

concretely to a -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you are agreeing,

19

Mr. Dreeben, that a court in that circumstance

20

should conduct a comity analysis?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23
24
25

Yes.
And if you are, what

would that look like and when would it occur?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, in our view, it

would occur at the contempt stage, after the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

government procures an order, if it seeks to

2

impose sanctions on a party for noncompliance.

3

That's roughly the model that this Court used

4

in Societe Internationale versus Rogers, a 1958

5

decision that squarely posed the question of

6

whether a party over whom a U.S. court had

7

jurisdiction could be ordered to produce

8

documents that were located in Switzerland when

9

Swiss law had a blocking statute.

10

And the Court had no problem with the

11

issuance of the order, but it had a great deal

12

of problem with failure to conduct any comity

13

analysis that took into account possible

14

conflicts with foreign law.

15

And that same framework was applied by

16

lower courts when they encountered grand jury

17

subpoenas seeking financial information located

18

in foreign countries -- states, and there was

19

an assertion of a conflict with foreign law.

20

So there's nothing new about this

21

problem.

It's a problem that courts have been

22

grappling with for decades, quite successfully.

23

And what's more remarkable is it's never come

24

up under the Stored Communications Act.

25

have had no protests, either before or after

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We

We've been willing

10

to assume for purposes of this case that its

11

focus mirrors 2703 and addresses only domestic

12

disclosures, but that only puts us in the same

13

position as Microsoft, with one difference.

14

Microsoft's theory is that if it moves its

15

information abroad, since storage is the only

16

thing that counts, it's then free to disclose

17

that information to the world, to sell it, to

18

do anything it wants free from U.S. law.

19

The only thing that Microsoft adds to

20

that picture is that the only person who can't

21

get it is the United States under lawful

22

process.

23

that the Court should reverse that judgment.

12

the act to unilaterally reach into a foreign

incorrect, that until this very case Microsoft

23

This case is the first time it

24

objected, but there were past efforts of the

25

same kind and Microsoft disclosed the contents

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

of the communications.

2

Is that so?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor, but

3

what -- I just -- I want to make sure that you

4

-- you -- that the Court understands, Justice

5

Ginsburg, that this is a very new phenomenon,

6

this whole notion of cloud storage in another

7

country.

8
9

We didn't start doing it until 2010.
So the fact that we analyzed what our legal

10

obligations were and realized, wait a minute,

11

this is actually an extraterritorial act that

12

is unauthorized by the U.S. Government, the

fact that we were sober-minded about it

And if there is a particular objection

by the government where the information is

government will have to deal with that.

6

gather that's not the situation here.

7

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

But I

Well, Your Honor,

8

first, it is the situation here, but let me

9

answer the question directly.

10

The reason that this is an

11

extraterritorial act goes right to the heart of

12

why we have a presumption against

13

extraterritoriality.

14

countries across the world believe that they

15

have the sovereignty and the sovereign right to

16

pass their own laws governing the access to

17

e-mails stored on their soil.

18

No one disputes that

And here we are reaching into their

19

lands and imposing our U.S. position on who

20

gets access to e-mails on their soil.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- why should

22

we have a binary choice between a focus on the

23

location of the data and the location of the

24

disclosure?

25

where the owner of the e-mail lives or where

Aren't there some other factors,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36

2

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

we're forced to this binary choice?

5

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Justice -­

Your Honor, that is a

6

consequence of this Court's analysis in

7

Morrison, which no one is challenging.

8

so, yes, you've got to figure out what the

9

focus is at step 2.

10

But,

No one's arguing for any focus other

11

than the government's argument that it focuses

12

on disclosure and our argument that it focuses

13

on storage.

that argument.

That's Congress's decision if

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under this Act,

could you voluntarily disclose this to the

2702?

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

It would not be a

13

violation of 2702 if we voluntarily did

14

something, but it would be a violation of our

15

obligations to our customers.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if that's so,

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Absolutely not, Your

Honor.

That is -- I -- I agree with you that

3

that is what the statute says, but it raises

4

the same exact problems of extraterritoriality

5

because -- I mean, the only thing that we

6

wouldn't be able to do is rely on the word

7

"warrant" and all of the territorial

8

implications of that word, but all of our other

9

answers would be the same.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what actions -­

what actions would Microsoft have to take

extraterritoriality -- extraterritorially to

14

comply with the -- in this case, the warrant?

15

What would Microsoft have to do outside the

16

United States?

17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, so let's start

18

with the fact that these e-mails are stored

19

outside the United States.

20

Ireland.

21

and fetch them from Ireland.

22

They are stored in

They are subject to protections in

So what happens in Ireland?

happens in Ireland is really a remote control

25

is actually working a mechanism where these

Heritage Reporting Corporation

What

44
1

e-mails are stored on a hard drive in a

2

facility under protection of foreign law, and a

3

-- a reader, which is a physical piece of

4

hardware, reads the digital ones and zeros off

5

of it, which are also physical manifestations.

6

It's then packaged up and it runs through

7

Ireland on hard wires and over the Atlantic.

8

This is a quintessentially extraterritorial

9

act.

10

Now I was just saying -- there are a

11

lot of complicated questions in this case, but

12

the decisive point and the point that Justice

13

Gorsuch was making earlier is that the e-mails

14

are stored in Ireland and the DEA is forcing us

15

to fetch them.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, I don't

-- perhaps it's my technological ignorance.

How is it in a locked box?

mentally imagine this, what has to happen?

accesses directly the information in Ireland,

or does something have to happen in Ireland?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

extraterritorial search; it would, therefore,

be illegal.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, there's a basic

7

physical property at issue here that

8

underscores that this is not just some random

9

act of putting e-mails in one place or another.

10

There's this physical phenomenon called

11

latency.

12

service for those 200 -­

13

It actually slows down the e-mail

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So you

-- so they have to wait a little longer, I

15

assume quite -- quite a short while longer, but

16

they're protected from any government intrusion

matter what happens, the government won't be

able to get access to their e-mails.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, so this

5

is the -- the tail-wagging-the-dog problem.

have 200 million customers who are relying on

the best service here in the United States that

can possibly be brought.

14

of 60,000.

The percentage of those that

It's 99.9 -­

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know, but my

16

basic point, and I'm not sure that you've

17

answered it, is that there is nothing that

18

prevents Microsoft -- in other words, an e-mail

19

from me to somebody on the other side of the

20

building that is going to be stored somewhere

21

else would be protected from disclosure, if

22

people, the government, wanted access in the

23

normal course of a criminal investigation where

24

they have a warrant establishing probable

25

cause.

From here to the next block, that is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

going to be protected from disclosure to the

2

government.

3

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And, Your Honor, my

4

answer is an equally practical one, and that

5

is, if customers do not want their e-mails to

6

be seized by the government, they don't use

7

Microsoft's services.

8

Microsoft's services whether they are in Canada

9

or Mexico because those are available by MLATs.

10

They don't use

What do they do?

They use services

11

that are sold specifically with the -- with the

12

promise that we have no U.S. presence, and,

13

therefore, you can trust us to keep it under

14

lock and key from the U.S. Government.

15

By the way, you probably all have cell

16

phones with this feature.

It is a feature that

17

scrambles your instant messaging and that -­

18

that scrambles it in a way that no government

19

can get their hands on it.

20

So it's not like this is a device that

21

is available only through Microsoft's services.

22

If people want to break the law and put their

23

e-mails outside the reach of the U.S.

24

Government, they simply wouldn't use Microsoft.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it correct that we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

don't know the nationality of the individual

2

who has this e-mail account?

3
4
5

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, that is correct,

Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if this person

6

is not Irish and Ireland played no part in your

7

decision to store the information there and

8

there's nothing that Ireland could do about it

9

if you chose tomorrow to move it someplace

10

else, it is a little difficult for me to see

11

what Ireland's interest is in this.

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, Ireland's

13

interests are the same interests of any

14

sovereign who protects information stored where

15

-- within their domain.

16

We protect information stored within

17

the United States and we don't actually care

18

whose information it is because we have laws

19

that guard the information for everyone.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I guess the point

21

is when we're talking about this information,

22

which, all right, yes, it -- it physically

23

exists on one or more computers somewhere, but

24

it doesn't have a presence anyplace in the

25

sense that a physical object has a presence

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

someplace.

2

And the Internet service providers can

3

put it anywhere they want and move it around at

4

will.

5

strained.

The whole idea of territoriality is

6

Wouldn't you agree with that?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I -- I would not

7

agree with that, Justice Alito, and here's why:

8

First, I disagree with the premise.

9

This -- these e-mails have a physical

10

presence.

11

Are they movable?

12

movable as well.

13

They are actually on a hard drive.
Yes.

But letters are

And they are under protection of

14

foreign laws, which, by the way, are really

15

quite robust.

16

the -- to the basic question of focus, the

17

common thread that ties together all of these

18

cross-referenced provisions of the SCA, the

19

common thread is stored communications that are

20

in electronic storage.

21

provisions together and that is the focus of -­

22
23
24
25

So moving -- moving just back to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And what about

-JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why do we need to
Why shouldn't we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

just look at 2703 and ask what Congress was

2

trying to do in that section?

3

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor,

4

even if you focus on 2703 and -- and isolate it

5

from everything else, the first thing I'd say

6

is even the government agrees that that's not

7

what you're supposed to do.

8

minimum allowed to look at how it relates to

9

other provisions.

10

You are at a

The focus is still on protecting

11

e-mails in electronic storage from government

12

intrusion.

13

It is not about -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how do we know

14

really?

I mean, it seems as though we have a

15

choice between two things:

16

Congress is doing is it's regulating the

17

disclosure in the United States of electronic

18

communications that are stored everywhere in

19

the world.

20

saying.

21

One is what

And that's what the government is

And you're essentially saying the

22

opposite.

What Congress was doing was to

23

regulate the disclosure anywhere in the world

24

of electronic communications that are stored in

25

the United States.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

I'm not sure how I pick between those

2

two from the face of the statute, whether it's

3

2703 or whether it's the broader statute.

4

give me your best shot.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Okay.

So I -- I'll

7

give you, if I may, I'll give you a couple

8

shots.

9

So

If we're only focusing on 2703,

10

Congress passed the -- the 2703 because it

11

wanted to limit law enforcement access to a

12

specific category of e-mails.

13

what?

14

And that is

E-mails that are in electronic storage.
Congress was concerned that e-mails

15

shared with a service provider would lose all

16

Fourth Amendment protection under the

17

third-party doctrine.

18

Congress did not need to pass 2703 to

19

author disclosure by a warrant.

20

enforcement already had access by a warrant.

21

The focus was on enhancing the security of

22

e-mails that were in electronic storage.

23

Law

Now back up and relate the various

24

provisions, 2701, 2702, 2703.

I was saying

25

earlier, at the most basic level, this is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

Stored Communications Act.

2

communications that are sitting in storage.

3

It's about securing

I was describing earlier this brave

4

new world that Congress was facing where it

5

wanted people to -- to understand that their

6

e-mails in electronic storage were safe.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If I -- but

8

you focus on the storage.

2703 is headed,

9

"Required disclosure of customer communications

10

or records."

11

the Act when it amended it.

12

And Congress put that heading in

And it seems to me that the government

13

might have a strong position there that the

14

statute focuses on disclosure.

15

takes place in Washington, not in Ireland.

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And disclosure

Well, Your Honor,

17

2703 -- this goes back to Justice Kagan's

18

question -- it cannot be read in isolation from

19

2702.

20

27 -- 2701 and 2702 are with 2703 -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, 2702

21

says, "Voluntary disclosure of customer

22

communications or records."

23

place in Washington, not Ireland.

24

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

25

And that too takes

And so the answer,

Your Honor, is that -- that the Act was first

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

and fundamentally about protecting the

2

communications that were in electronic storage,

3

and so 2703 pairs with 2702.

4

Now, 2702 is about making sure -- so

5

2702, as -- as the government has suggested, is

6

about making sure that the electronic -- that

7

the electronic communications in electronic

8

storage are protected.

9

exception to 2702.

10

And 2703 is simply an

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you're -- I'm

11

going to ask a technical thing to help me with

12

that, and do it -- no more than 15 seconds.

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I did is I -- I

15

looked at the warrant which is in the record,

16

and it's signed by James Francis, Magistrate

17

Judge, Southern District, New York.

18

right?

Is that

19

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So then I went

21

over to Rule 41, and I assumed it fell within

22

(b), (a), or, what is it, it's -- it's (b)(1).

23

Am I right or is it -- do you know that well

24

enough in your head?

25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

2

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

But let me hear the

3

question again.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, if it fell

5

within (b)(1), it says that Mr. Francis, Judge

6

Francis, has authority to issue a warrant to

7

search for and seize a property located within

8

the district.

9
10

So that's how I got in by -- into my
linguistic problem of -- what's the answer?

11

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, 27

12

-- the government has invoked 2703(a), which is

13

--

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah -­

15

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

-- the provision that

16

requires a warrant.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and it says, "only

18

pursuant to a warrant issued using the

19

procedures described in the Federal Rules of

20

Criminal Procedure."

21

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I said what's the

23

warrant?

It's Judge Francis's warrant.

24

in the Southern District of New York.

25

to Rule 41, and there 41(b)(1) -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

He's
I went

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Oh, 41, yes.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- which -- you see?

3

Yeah.

4

answer says that Judge Francis -- this says

5

that Judge Francis has authority to issue a

6

warrant to search for property in New York.

7

So -- so what's the answer to that?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yeah, I -- I agree

8

with you, Justice Breyer.

9

are distinctly territorial devices.

10

The

And -- and warrants
They're

not extraterritorial devices.

15

I -- I think the

question -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

But you didn't make

much of a point of this in your brief.

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so I suspect that

18

-- that -- that it just can't be that easy,

19

this case.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Justice Breyer, I

21

in our brief -­

No, but, Mr.

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- I think the

3

question is this:

If this information were in

4

Redmond, Washington, would the magistrate judge

5

be unable to issue the order because Redmond,

6

Washington, is not in New York?

7

question.

That's the

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.

9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Oh, he would not be

10

able to issue the warrant.

11

because Redmond, Washington, is not in New

12

York.

13

nationwide ability to reach evidence within the

14

United States, warrants are not

15

extraterritorial.

16

And it's not

It's because warrants, although there is

Now just by way of -- of wrapping up,

17

the government asks this Court to grant it an

18

extraordinary power, and it's a power that

19

Congress did not think it was granting law

20

enforcement in 1986, and certainly did not

21

intend to grant to every police officer and

22

every sheriff's deputy anywhere in the country.

23

Back then, if the police needed to

24

gather evidence from all over the world, they

25

would have to engage with law enforcement

Heritage Reporting Corporation

everywhere else in those countries.

2

The Internet makes it possible now to

3

reach a lifetime of correspondence for billions

4

of people all across the world, but only

5

Congress can grant that power.

6

And this goes to Justice Ginsburg's

7

point.

Think about the questions that the

8

Court has been wrestling with today.

9

about the architecture of other providers.

It's

10

It's -- there were conversations about where

11

the Internet is headed.

12

about whether this will kill the tech sector,

13

how much of an international consensus there is

14

about the sovereignty of data.

15

There is conversations

These are all questions that only

16

Congress can answer.

Meanwhile, this Court's

17

job is to defer -- to defer to Congress to take

18

the path that is least likely to create

19

international tensions.

20

And if you try to tinker with this,

21

without the tools that -- that only Congress

22

has, you are as likely to break the cloud as

23

you are to fix it.

24
25

If there are no further questions, I
-- I thank the Court for its attention.

And we

respectfully request that the Court affirm the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. DREEBEN:

9
10

I have four quick

points, two technical and two substantive.
The technical point first is, Justice

11

Breyer, you asked what the authority of the

12

district court is.

13

district court, in this case for a magistrate

14

judge, comes from, first, 2703, which entitles

15

a court of competent jurisdiction to issue the

16

relevant warrant in this case.

17

The authority of the

This is on page 6A of the government's

18

appendix to its brief.

19

definition of a court of competent jurisdiction

20

on page 12A of the appendix to the government's

21

brief, which defines it to include any

22

magistrate judge that has jurisdiction over the

23

offense being investigated, as well as several

24

other bases.

25

There is then a

This was a Patriot Act amendment

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

designed to expand the authority of courts to

2

issue orders.

3

The second technical question is the

4

one asked by Justice Kennedy on whether

5

Microsoft could voluntarily disclose this

6

information to the government.

7

It's barred by 2702 from making disclosures,

8

except as authorized by that statute.

9

It couldn't.

And one of the exceptions is that the

10

government can proceed under 2703 to compel the

11

same information.

12

claiming the authority, once it moves the

13

information overseas, to unilaterally disclose

14

it to anyone.

15

responding to an order that's issued by the

16

United States, it says it has no obligation to

17

produce the information.

18

So Microsoft is basically

But if it's in, you know,

And then the substantive points here

19

are that this statute does, indeed, focus on

20

disclosure, not storage.

21

requiring disclosure as to the variety of

22

categories of information that providers may

23

have, and it backs it up with at least three

24

more provisions that address disclosure.

25

2703 begins by

Section (e) says there's no cause of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

action for disclosing in accordance with the

2

statute.

3

issue preservation orders of the information to

4

be disclosed.

5

I complete the sentence?

Section (f) allows the government to

And Section (g) discusses -- may

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

MR. DREEBEN:

Sure.

-- discusses the

8

execution of the warrant and it provides that

9

the government need not be there, which makes

10

this an instrument, not like a warrant that

11

allows us to conduct a search, but like a

12

subpoena or discovery order that places

13

obligations on parties over whom the court has

14

jurisdiction.

15
16
17
18

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
counsel.

Thank you,

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:22 a.m., the case

was submitted.)
