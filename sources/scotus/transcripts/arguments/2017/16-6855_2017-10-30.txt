Mr. Olive.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK E. OLIVE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. OLIVE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

When a court in 2254 proceedings

12

reviews a state court's summary denial of

13

appeal from a lower court's reasoned

14

post-conviction opinion, the federal court

15

should look through the appellate cited order

16

to that last reasoned decision, as this Court

17

does, as all the circuits have done, other than

18

the Eleventh.

19

fits the history of AEDPA, it best fits the

20

plain reading of 2254(d), and it best fits this

21

Court's precedents.

22

A look-through like this best

The ruling in Richter was a necessary

23

ruling and a narrow ruling.

The question posed

24

in Richter was what to do "where a state

25

court's decision is unaccompanied by an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

explanation."

2

This Court's choice was either to

3

require de novo review of that, utterly

4

inconsistent with the purpose and the history

5

of AEDPA, or to accommodate AEDPA and 2254(d).

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose that the -­

7

the Georgia Supreme Court in this case had

8

issued an order saying we affirm the decision

9

below; our decision should not be taken as

10

necessarily agreeing or disagreeing with the

11

reasoning in the lower court's opinion.

12
13

Would look-through be appropriate in
that situation?

14

MR. OLIVE:

Your Honor, it depends.

15

The Ylst presumption is rebuttable, as Justice

16

Scalia explained in the 1991 opinion, and he

17

also explained that there's no gold standard

18

for how it is rebutted.

19

of how it could be rebutted.

20
21
22
23

JUSTICE ALITO:

He gave some examples

Well, what if -- if

that -­
MR. OLIVE:

And I think that would be

something to consider, but whether it would -­

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

MR. OLIVE:

So you -­

-- ultimately rebut, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

couldn't say.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

MR. OLIVE:

4

You can't say?

Right.

I know that it -­

that it -­

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

So we -- we would -­

6

we would presume that the state supreme court

7

had adopted the reasoning of the lower court

8

even though the supreme court said specifically

9

that it didn't?

10

MR. OLIVE:

I think that it goes a

11

long way toward rebutting, but whether it

12

ultimately would rebut could depend on other

13

facts and circumstances in the case.

14

For example, there could be a reason

15

for that decision because the state briefs

16

things that weren't presented as bases for the

17

decision below.

18

Justice Scalia said in Ylst in '91, asked for

19

further briefing on some items and got that

20

further briefing on some items.

21

that a court saying that, it is a significant

22

circumstance to consider.

23

Supreme Court is quite capable of saying that.

24

And -­

25

It could be that the court, as

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I agree

And the Georgia

Suppose it said it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

in every case.

2

the Georgia Supreme Court says now we're going

3

to add, as boilerplate to every decision, we

4

are not relying on the reasoning of the lower

5

court.

6

Suppose you win here and then

MR. OLIVE:

That -- that would seem

7

like a ruse, Your Honor, to do it, and how

8

could they know in every single case that

9

that's what they're going to do and why would

10

they intend in every single case -­

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you could play

12

with the words.

13

affirm not necessarily for the reasons below.

14

You know, they could have a formulation.

15

They could say we do -- we

MR. OLIVE:

Yes, I -- you know, the -­

16

Justice -- even the dissent below said that

17

that was a possibility.

18

critique that this is judging opinions by lower

19

courts -­

20
21

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. OLIVE:

-- or for having an

opinion -­

24
25

Well, why would it

be -­

22
23

And it gets around the

JUSTICE ALITO:
ruse?

-- why would it be a

I -- it seems to me that there is a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

general -- that that is the general practice of

2

appellate courts in the United States.

3

court summarily affirms the decision of the

4

lower court, the summary affirmance is not

5

taken as necessarily adopting the reasoning of

6

the lower court.

7

When a

That's the meaning of our summary

8

affirmances.

That is the meaning, the

9

established meaning of thousands and thousands

10

of summary affirmances by federal district

11

courts -- by federal courts of appeals.

12

MR. OLIVE:

Well, we know that -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That might be the

14

reasoning, correct, on merits decisions.

15

necessarily what courts do in granting or not

16

granting a COA?

17

MR. OLIVE:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19
20
21

Is it

Granting or not granting?
A COA, which is

what's at issue here, correct?
MR. OLIVE:

Right.

That's correct.

We -- we actually know that it -­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

lost -- what -- what's correct?

24

MR. OLIVE:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, I

Would you repeat it?
What I said was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

8
1

it's true that on summary affirmances, where

2

there's been full argument by both sides -­

3

MR. OLIVE:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

Right.
-- that you don't

know the basis for a lower court's decision.

6

MR. OLIVE:

Right.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But is that the

8

uniform -- the same thing, a uniform practice

9

in granting or denying a COA?

10
11
12

MR. OLIVE:

I don't know the answer to

that question.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, we do know

13

in this case because we have a former chief

14

judge of Georgia and a bunch of other -­

15

MR. OLIVE:

That's correct.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- judges from

17

Georgia telling us that that's not the standard

18

in Georgia, correct?

19
20
21

MR. OLIVE:

Correct.

That is correct.

The summary affirmance -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

But that's a question

22

of -- that's a question of Georgia law.

23

not a question of Ylst -­

24
25

MR. OLIVE:

That's

Well, we know that this

Court doesn't consider the denial of a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

certificate of probable cause to appeal not to

2

adopt the decision of the habeas court.

3

both Sears and in Foster, this Court looked at

4

a CPC denial and concluded not that it was

5

precedent or that it said anything, but instead

6

looked through it to the -- to the habeas

7

corpus court and the -- and the state.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

In

Well, that's a very

debatable -- that's a very debatable and -­

10

and, I think, a dubious reading of both of

11

those decisions.

12

those decisions that says in determining, like

13

in Foster, was the -- was -- was there a Batson

14

violation.

15

consider only the things that were said by the

16

lower state court; we're not going to consider

17

anything else.

There's nothing in any of

We didn't say we're going to

18

Did we say that?

19

MR. OLIVE:

20

focused its attention on.

21
22
23

That's what the Court

JUSTICE ALITO:

Did it say that,

though?
MR. OLIVE:

It didn't -- you didn't -­

24

no, sir, you didn't say that expressly, but

25

that's exactly what you looked to.

You didn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

say, oh, well, the state supreme court had a

2

better reason or a different reason; we ought

3

to defer to it.

4

You -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but if

5

you have it -- I think in Foster it was

6

pertinent in the analysis of the -- the lower

7

state court determination was certainly

8

evidence of what the issues were and were not

9

decided.

But I've read the footnote carefully,

10

and I don't see anything in there that

11

suggested that that was a -- an absolute rule

12

of law.

13

MR. OLIVE:

Looking at what the

14

practice that the court undertook and the

15

procedure the court undertook, you looked at

16

the reasons given by the state habeas court.

17

I agree that the state would never

18

cite a CPC denial as precedent for anything in

19

Georgia, and they haven't and we wouldn't

20

either.

21

case and in most cases, except when the court

22

says otherwise, the court is adopting the facts

23

as set forth in the lower court's opinion.

24
25

But it -- it is clear that, in this

The state -- the state, in its brief
to the Georgia Supreme Court in support of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

denial of CPC, argued strictly the bases that

2

were in the order that was entered in the lower

3

court, which they wrote, by the way, with some

4

alterations -- minor alterations by the court.

5

And in the brief -- in that brief,

6

they cited 52 times this court should deny the

7

CPC on the basis of what the lower court did.

There was no -­

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose -- suppose

10

that there is a decision by a state

11

intermediate court of appeals, and the majority

12

rejects a claim for certain reasons, and

13

there's a concurrence in the judgment that says

14

we would also reject the claim -- or I would

15

also reject the claim for a different reason,

16

and then that decision is summarily affirmed by

17

the state supreme court.

I think it would be

look-through.

What about the

commonsense, well-known, well-used -­

well-understood rule that a summary affirmance

by an appellate court is not interpreted in

13

this country as an adoption of the reasoning of

14

the lower court?

15

MR. OLIVE:

According to Ylst, where

there's been one reasoned state judgment -­

judgment rejecting a federal claim, federal

18

habeas courts should presume later unexplained

19

orders rest upon the same ground.

rule of Ylst, and it's been applied by all the

21

circuits.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the

Except that that

was a procedural default question.
MR. OLIVE:

It -- it -- it was.

the logic is the same.

But

The logic is most -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

most narrowly reflects the role such orders are

2

ordinarily intended to play, except -­

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

thought the logic -- the logic would be,

5

though, that it is unusual for a court

6

reviewing a procedural determination, if you

7

can't tell, because it's silent, you would

8

normally not assume the court went on to the

9

merits when the lower court said there was a

10

Well, I

procedural bar.

11

But when it's simply merits decisions

12

in both cases, the -- the argument anyway is

13

that that's a different situation.

14

MR. OLIVE:

Well, the circuits haven't

15

ruled that way, and I know you're wanting to

16

resolve the issue for all of us now.

17

Court has looked through on merits rulings as

18

well without citing Ylst.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But when -- when -­

when -­

23

MR. OLIVE:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

This

-- in McWilliams.
-- when the

question is -- this question will arise only if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

that lower court decision was unreasonable.

2

MR. OLIVE:

That's correct.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So why shouldn't a

4

court of appeals -- why don't we assume that a

5

court of appeals would not adopt a badly

6

reasoned decision?

7

MR. OLIVE:

Well, I think that

8

probably that is a good assumption and that in

9

most instances state courts get it right, but

10

in the situation where a order is palpably

11

unreasonable, what Congress directs us to do is

12

apply de novo review.

13

And so the individuals who will be

14

injured by this rule, Respondent's rule and the

15

lower court's rule, are the people whose very

16

judgments ought to be viewed -- ought to be

17

getting greater review.

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Olive, if we're

19

talking about consequences of the ruling here,

20

it seems to me it's possible that by adopting a

21

look-through rule, we would encourage state

22

supreme courts to say more, perhaps very little

23

more, maybe as little as we're -- we're

24

agreeing with the result but not necessarily

25

the reasoning.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

But equally possible would be to

2

encourage state intermediate courts to say less

3

and perhaps take advantage of Harrington, so

4

that no state court says anything and achieves

5

maximum deference from federal courts, like

6

California has, for example.

7

Should we be concerned that a ruling

8

in favor of look-through might actually yield

9

if states are rational and look for the least

10

cost and the most deference adverse

11

consequences to your -- your -- your clients?

12

MR. OLIVE:

13

assertion of that in Richter.

14

was there are no -- there is no merit to the

15

assertion that our decision will encourage

16

state courts to withhold explanations.

17

writing practices are influenced by

18

considerations other than avoiding scrutiny by

19

federal courts.

20

You know, there was an

Opinion

And that's at 562 West at 99.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21

you agree with that?

22

that's right?

23

And the response

MR. OLIVE:

I'm asking you, do

I mean, do you think

Yeah, I don't agree with

24

that.

I think that federal -- I mean state

25

court judges are not nearly as concerned with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

federal review as some say.

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I understand they

3

are, but perhaps state legislatures are.

4

they may for altruistic reasons, as in Georgia

5

-- very, very altruistic reasons, insist on a

6

practice of some reasoned decision-making, but

7

couldn't you see other state legislators making

8

other decisions, say like California has,

9

because of the cost of analyzing these cases?

10

MR. OLIVE:

And

We note just as -- as an

11

aside, that's changed now in California under

12

Proposition 66, all capital cases start in the

13

lower court and will go through the appeals

14

process, when that's eventually implemented.

15

But, no, I don't think the

16

legislatures or the courts after AEDPA are

17

losing ground when it comes to federal habeas.

18

And they have reasons for structuring their -­

19

their processes in whatever way they please.

20

And in Georgia, it's a serious opinion

21

writing endeavor by a trial court that then is

22

looked through, or has been for years, until

23

two, about two years ago, by the appellate

24

court.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

So how seriously

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

should we take a word that you read from Ylst

2

which was "presume," it says the -- the habeas

3

court should presume that this simple, one-word

4

statement of the state supreme court means that

5

the decision that's keeping the person in

6

prison is, in fact, the decision of the

7

intermediate appellate court?

8
9

Now, then if it's a presumption, the
state could refute it.

And I guess is this

10

right?

11

look, here, Your Honor, to federal judges,

12

look, this decision of the intermediate court

13

is so obviously wrong, in any event, it's so

14

obviously a procedural ground, an adequate

15

state ground, and look at what they argued to

16

the state supreme court and bring out the

17

briefs, and say under these circumstances you

18

shouldn't presume that that lower court

19

decision is what the supreme court decided on.

20

The state would be free to say, well,

Indeed, nobody even claimed in the

21

supreme court that they ought to just decide on

22

that ground.

23

such -- would they be free to do that kind of

24

thing?

25

I mean, would you be free to do

MR. OLIVE:

I think they would, but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

the state has never in Georgia disagreed that

2

it's most improbable that the Georgia Supreme

3

Court's decisions did not rely on -­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it's -- in

5

Georgia, I take it, the adequate state ground

6

is not really one -- it's not in play in this

7

kind of situation, but there are states where

8

it are -- it is.

9

I don't know how well, but what -­

10

what I've just said and what you said it would

11

be free, is that basically the situation that

12

most of the states use, as that's what's going

13

on right now in the country.

14

MR. OLIVE:

The circumstances under

15

which the presumption can be rebutted are

16

probably innumerable.

17

went in the lower court and -- and other

18

indicia are important.

19

And how the briefing

Again, the court in Georgia is

20

perfectly free to, knows how to, and does issue

21

orders denying CPC for bases other than the

22

briefs of the parties or other than what was in

23

the lower court.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did the -- did the

lower court in this case that we looked-through

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

to, did it say anything at all about why it

2

found no prejudice?

3

MR. OLIVE:

It did, Your Honor.

It

4

said that much of the evidence that had been

5

proffered in post-conviction was cumulative,

6

which it really -- there's an argument that it

7

wasn't that I can make.

8
9

And also that the neuropsychological
testing omissions could not be considered

10

prejudicial, but didn't really give reasons,

11

other than the evidence of guilt and the

12

evidence in aggravation.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it said -­

14

didn't it -- I mean, it said a lot.

15

devoted about 30 pages to this.

16

I think it

And I -- I suspect you think that some

17

of the things that it said were wrong, but is

18

it fair to say that in general it said, in

19

fact, said over and over one of the reasons why

20

we find no -- why -- why the judge found no

21

prejudice is that taking into account all the

22

evidence that it suggested is mitigating and

23

all of the aggravating evidence -- and there

24

was a lot of it here -- the addition of this

25

mitigating evidence wouldn't change the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

outcome?

2

Didn't the court say that?
MR. OLIVE:

The court did say that.

3

But it wasn't -- it didn't consider all of the

4

mitigating evidence.

5

mitigating evidence that had to do with this

6

19-year-old who had not, in the defense of the

7

case, killed anyone with respect to this crime

8

and whose lawyer said he's just been bad and

9

led a bad life.

10

There was a -- a swath of

There was, in fact, presentation at

11

post-conviction proceedings of evidence of

12

redeemability for this person and his good

13

acts.

14

And -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

No, it wasn't, all

15

right, it wasn't presented at trial, but it was

16

presented to the habeas court.

And it was not mentioned

by the habeas court.

MR. OLIVE:

Well -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is your answer to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

the argument that what you're asking the

2

federal habeas court to do really is to grade

3

the quality of the opinion that was written?

4

MR. OLIVE:

Well, the evidence that

5

was offered was of institutional failure and

6

also things like he was creative and

7

intelligent and was struggling to break away

8

from his past.

9

And -- and the redeemability, this

10

Court knows, with an 18-year-old, a

11

17-year-old, a 19-year-old is serious

12

mitigation.

13

it's not a grading of what the judge did or the

14

opinion that was written.

15

But, Your Honor, they -- they -­

2254 works this way.

The Court says federal habeas judges

16

must train their attention on what was actually

17

involved -- this is a quote -- "in the

18

application of this Court's law to facts."

19

That's kind of a grading, but you can get a D

20

and pass under 2254.

21

It's just egregious actions outside

22

the realm that no one would consider

23

reasonable.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, so what if

the -- what the habeas court did was this?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

They said this is all the evidence that is -­

2

is proffered in mitigation, and this is all the

3

evidence that was provided by the state in

4

aggravation, and taking into account all the -­

5

all the mitigation and all the aggravation, we

6

conclude that there's no reasonable probability

7

that a jury would have returned anything other

8

than a sentence of death?

9

Now, would that be -- would that be

10

unreasonable because there isn't a detailed

11

explanation?

12

MR. OLIVE:

In -- in this case, we

13

think it would be unreasonable.

14

state wrote this order.

15

wrong with that.

16

sides, and the judge takes it and amends it in

17

whatever way they think necessary.

18

a very minimal way in this case.

19

Again, the

The -- there's nothing

There's orders for both

And it was

And the order that was written and the

20

order that was signed reduced to irrelevancy,

21

it went through item by item various things,

22

but when it got to the institutional failure

23

and to the positive characteristics and traits

24

of this 19-year-old, you can't find it.

did.
JUSTICE ALITO:

-- so let me modify

8

what I -- my hypothetical where there's no

9

explanation, there's just a citation -- there's

10

just a listing of mitigation and aggravation.

11

There's a little bit of explanation.

12

three sentences of explanation or there's a

13

half a page of explanation.

14

There are

At what point does it become, would

15

you say, okay, well, that's enough, it's

16

reasonable?

17

MR. OLIVE:

Well, that's -- the level

18

of abstraction there is difficult for me to

19

give an answer to, but this Court has given an

20

answer in Williams and Wiggins and Rompilla and

21

Porter where the Court painstakingly went

22

through the evidence on aggravation and

23

mitigation, especially on the prejudice prong.

24

So grading is a bad label for it, but

25

the AEDPA says take a look at what they said

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

and analyze it and see if it's reasonable.

2

And the second prong of 2254(d), which

3

I didn't mention before, the court has to grade

4

in that you look at what the state fact

5

findings were based upon.

6

look at the opinion, you do have to analyze the

7

opinion.

8

take much to get a high enough grade to pass

9

2254 muster for the courts.

10

So you do have to

If that's called grading, it doesn't

And going back to the limited holding

11

in Richter, this Court's language shows its

12

fealty really to 2254.

13

2254(d), a habeas court must determine what

14

arguments or theories supported" -- and so, if

15

there's a written opinion, you can see what

16

arguments or theories supported -- "or, as

17

here, could have supported the state court's

decision."

The Court says, "Under

20

with look-through, our argument is you do know

21

the reasons, if you know the reasons for the

22

23

follow Richter where there is no opinion

24

explaining the reasons relief has been denied.

25

And under Wetzel, this Court says

taking out the second clause, a habeas -­

2

habeas court must determine what -- or -­

3

arguments or theories supported the state

4

court's decision.

5

In this case, it's -- it is clear and

6

has been clear for years that the arguments

7

that support -- to support the Georgia Supreme

8

Court's denial of CPC are those arguments that

9

are in the state post-conviction reasoned

10

order.

11

And if the Court wishes to -- to go

12

beyond that, it's quite capable of doing it.

13

It can issue three or four pages in denying

14

CPC, and it does.

15

It can issue a paragraph in denying

16

CPC, explaining reasons beyond the lower court,

17

and it does.

18

to do it, it can do it.

19

Otherwise, the presumption in Ylst should be

20

respected.

21

The Court -- if the Court wants
It knows how to do it.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Have there been any

commentary or can the bar offer us any

experience as to whether or not the Richter

24

rule, in the cases where it has applied has

25

proven to be workable and administratable or

13

The workability of -- of Richter in

its application in other jurisdictions, I'm not

15

seeing commentary on, but it is, again, cabined

16

to the unique situation which otherwise the

17

Court might have had to order de novo review

18

with respect to the unique situation that there

19

be no reasons given by a court.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, Richter does

21

require a habeas court, a federal habeas court

22

to imagine all of the conceivable arguments

23

that could have supported a state court

24

decision, correct?

25

MR. OLIVE:

Yes, ma'am.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it, by

definition, requires more work.

MR. OLIVE:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because you're not

really granting habeas relief that will result

3

in -- necessarily in the release of a defendant

because, once it goes back down, the state

5

court can then decide which among the many

6

possibilities there are to still affirm the

7

conviction, couldn't it?

9

MR. OLIVE:

That's correct.

And, you

know, all that happens when you do an analysis

10

of a reasoned decision, if you find it to be

11

unreasonable, you get de novo review.

12

don't get relief, you get de novo review, and

13

you may lose under de novo review.

You

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH HAWKINS WARREN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MS. WARREN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

5

A federal habeas court must apply 28

6

U.S.C. 2254(d)'s standard to the last state

7

court merits decision whether that decision is

8

summary and whether or not that decision is

9

preceded by a lower state court's opinion.

10

Put another way, federal habeas courts

11

conducting a 2254(d) inquiry are not required

12

to look-through a later summary state court

13

merits decision to review only the specific

14

reasoning of a lower state court opinion.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Warren, can I just

16

ask a question about the breadth of your

17

position?

18

from the briefs.

19

It's a little bit confusing to me

You spent a lot of time talking about

20

the word "decision" and how habeas review is

21

only available for decisions, not for opinions.

22

So does your argument go that even

23

when the -- a state court, the higher state

24

court has issued a reasoned decision, that even

25

there the habeas court is not limited to that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

decision but can and should decide whether

2

there are other grounds?

3

MS. WARREN:

Justice Kagan, our

4

position is that 2254(d) always applies to the

5

decision, but when that last state court

6

adjudication on the merits is reasoned, there

7

is a textual basis in 2254(d) for the federal

8

habeas court to look at those reasons to help

9

assess whether the decision itself is contrary

10

to or involved in unreasonable application of

11

this Court's precedents.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm not sure I

13

understand the question.

14

that the reasoned decision is -- is not -- is

15

just completely wrong.

16

But suppose you said

Could you substitute, you know, so I

17

think the way I've understood that that goes is

18

that's completely wrong, so now we don't -- we

19

don't give deference to it, right?

20

itself out of AEDPA because it's completely

21

wrong.

22

It's taken

Are you saying, no, there's a second

23

step where you have to say, well, if I were the

24

judge, I could have written a better decision

25

that would receive AEDPA deference?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

MS. WARREN:

No, Justice Kagan, I

2

don't think that's what our position is here.

3

So we would say that looking to the reasoning

4

as part of the analysis of the decision is part

5

and parcel of ascertaining whether that last

6

state court decision on the merits was contrary

7

to or involved in a reasonable application.

8
9

That, of course, is a very different
situation than we have here where the last

10

state court decision is summary and there is no

11

evidence of what that last state court actually

12

reasoned.

13
14
15

There is only the decision.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the -­

16

we were told that it was a matter of practice

17

in Georgia, I think Petitioner said, the

18

Georgia Supreme Court's practice is to issue a

19

reasoned denial of -- of a CPC whenever it

20

disagrees with the lower court reasoning.

21
22
23

So, if it disagrees, it's its practice
to tell us.
MS. WARREN:

Your Honor, I would

24

disagree that it always issues a reasoned

25

decision when it disagrees.

It is certainly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

true that there are instances, a handful of

2

instances that Petitioner points to where a

3

reasoned denial has issued.

4

But I don't think it is fair to

characterize it or to presume that those are

6

the only instances in which the Georgia Supreme

2

when somebody files an application for a cause,

3

for a certificate of probable cause, the

application, quote -- he's quoting from the

5

rule -- "will be issued where there is arguable

6

merit."

7

He says that Supreme Court Rule 36 says

And,

8

therefore, there is no arguable merit.

9

that seems like Euclid, or whoever, I don't

Aristotle or something.

JUSTICE BREYER:

their point.

We do know they

So I guess what you're asking us to do

is to think of ways that nobody, has yet

21

point.

What's the answer to my point?

MS. WARREN:

Justice Breyer, I'm -­

8

I'm not sure exactly what the -- what the

9

question was.

10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the point of

the question -­

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sorry.

Well, from

14

your pleasant expression, it sounded to me as

15

if you were understanding my obscure question.

16

My -- I had two separate questions.

17

One, I quoted the rule, which seemed to me what

18

Justice Sotomayor said, must be correct.

19

Then I asked a separate question, that

20

the problem looking at it practically is that

21

you're asking us to take on a burden.

22

person who will have a greater burden is you

23

because you, in your job, when faced with a

24

decision of an intermediate appellate court and

25

a denial of CPC, will have to sit there making

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The only

Official
36
1

up reasons that are not present in anybody's

2

opinion.

3

And I use Oglethorpe as a comic

4

example of that.

5

that you'll have to do.

6

But it's that kind of thing

So my question is obviously why should

7

we take a system that works fairly well and

8

throw this practical monkey wrench, which means

9

a lot more work for you, into the gears?

10
11
12

MS. WARREN:

A few answers to your

question, Your Honor.
The first is we agree with the way

13

that you stated the arguable merits standard

14

and I do think that is the correct way to view

15

Rule 36 from the Georgia Supreme Court.

16
17
18

As to the second point, a few
different answers.
As to the process, that process

19

exactly -- is exactly what the California

20

courts do with Richter already, so it is not a

21

novel process.

22

But on the practical side of things,

23

and as the Eleventh Circuit explained below, I

24

think in practice the federal habeas court when

25

assessing the Georgia Supreme Court summary

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

denial on the merits will first look to the

2

lower court to see if the lower court's

3

reasoned opinion offers any reasonable basis.

4

And so, in many cases, the process

5

would be very similar.

6

think the problem that -- the thread that runs

7

through the Petitioner's argument that is

8

problematic is presuming that the lower state

9

courts' reasons are the reasons of the Georgia

10

The problem here, and I

Supreme Court.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Ms. Warren, I take

12

that, but it seems to me that that's the

13

question, right?

14

what the Georgia Supreme Court is doing here in

15

-- in exactly the way you said?

16

What should we presume about

So let me give you a hypothetical.

17

Let's say we have a Batson case and there was a

18

denial of relief in the Batson case.

19

but it was based on a very clear error of law.

20

So somebody said -- it's a Hispanic defendant,

21

and somebody said Hispanic defendants are not

22

entitled to raise Batson claims.

23

And -­

All right?

And -- and then the -- the supreme

24

court, the state supreme court just says

25

affirmed.

All right?

So what should we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

understand about that?

2

Why -- why is the state court doing

3

that?

4

assumption about what the state court is doing?

5

What -- what -- what's the reasonable

MS. WARREN:

I think there are two

6

reasonable assumptions.

7

have, presuming that that claim was properly

8

preserved for merits review at the certificate

9

for probable cause stage, we can presume that

10

The first is that they

they have denied that claim on the merits.

11

But then I think that the -- the other

12

presumption we must make, according to this

13

Court's precedents and admonitions, we should

14

presume that the Georgia Supreme Court knew and

15

followed the law.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You see, this is -- it

17

seems a very odd thing to say the Georgia

18

Supreme Court looked at an opinion and said

19

that is such a bad opinion, it has such a clear

20

error of federal constitutional law, but we are

21

not going to explain that to anybody.

22

we're just going to affirm.

23

option.

24
25

Instead

Now, that's one

The other option is that the Georgia
Supreme Court had a bad day, and it too made an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

error.

And the question is, and I suppose, you

2

know, Ylst answered this question, but it

3

seemed to me to answer it in a pretty

4

reasonable way.

5

state supreme courts to say that's a clear

6

error of federal constitutional law and we are

7

not going to tell anybody about it.

8
9

It's like we just don't expect

MS. WARREN:

Well, the example you

give, Justice Kagan, there are a few things

10

about it.

The first is if there is a clear

11

error of law below and there is no other

12

reasonable basis on which the Georgia Supreme

13

Court could have denied relief, then habeas

14

relief will ensue.

15

Because even when the federal -­

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, no, no.

Here

17

there is, there's another basis, but -- but you

18

have to believe that what the state court is

19

saying, even though this -- this lower state

20

court made an error of federal constitutional

21

law, because we can dream up something better,

22

we'll just affirm it.

23

what we're -- what we think is an alternative

24

basis.

25

it be out there.

We won't tell anybody

We won't do anything.

We'll just let

That judge will think that

to make a Batson claim, but he had a bad Batson

claim?

MS. WARREN:

But, Justice Kagan, the

10

situation you describe is exactly the situation

11

where the approach we're describing is most

12

important for reasons of federalism and comity,

13

because we must start with the proposition that

14

this Court has reiterated time and time again,

15

that the Georgia Supreme Court did know and

16

follow the law, and to resist the readiness to

17

attribute error that this Court described in

18

Woodford versus Visciotti.

19

But in those situations -­

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, it seems to me

21

that that just makes a bizarre assumption about

22

state courts, that they're so uninterested in

23

errors of federal constitutional law that

24

they're just going to say, well, as long as we

25

have something in our heads that suggests that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

the ultimate judgment was right, we're not

2

going to tell anybody about them.

3

to leave them out there as -- as something that

4

the judge and the parties and -- and future

5

judges and future parties will think was right

6

when we know it's wrong.

MS. WARREN:

We're going

That -- that may be so,

8

Justice Kagan, but, of course, 2254(d) does not

9

require by its text reasoning.

It does not

10

require statement of opinions.

And this Court

11

has already found based on that very textual

12

interpretation the reasons are not required.

13

And that is exactly what this Court has -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, that's

15

the problem, which is it does require it,

16

because when you read 2254(d), it talks about

17

"resulted in a decision that was based on an

18

unreasonable determination of the facts in

19

light of the evidence presented in the state

20

court proceedings."

21

So it requires us to look at the

22

reasoning.

23

about involved an unreasonable application of

24

clearly established federal law.

25

So does (a) when it talks to us

So you're right.

There's nothing that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

42
1

says you have to write an opinion in a

2

particular way, but we do have to look at what

3

they say.

4

You even admit that.
MS. WARREN:

Justice Sotomayor, I

5

think we have to look at what they say when

6

they say something.

7

looking at the "involved in an unreasonable

8

application," I think that language points to

9

the situation I described with -- with Justice

And in a (d)(1) inquiry,

10

Kagan earlier, where there is a reasoned

11

opinion.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

13

take -- and let me just deviate to that

14

question.

15

Let's

Let's assume that there's an argument

16

below.

The state court denies the habeas

17

petition summarily.

18

to a habeas court and present an argument that

19

wasn't made below and argue that that is an

20

alternative ground to deny the habeas, even

21

though it wasn't presented below?

Can the state now come in

22

MS. WARREN:

Let me make sure I

23

understand your hypothetical.

24

suggesting that the lower state court did not

25

issue a reasoned opinion?

Are you

MS. WARREN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No -- exactly.

Okay.
No reasoned

6

But we know for a fact that this

MS. WARREN:

Well, in Georgia, by law,

7

the lower state court, the state habeas court,

8

is required to issue a reasoned opinion.

9

that is not a situation -­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So

I'm asking you

11

what happens on hab -- on federal habeas

12

review.

13

imagining that -- that we have the state doing

14

in every court, not only do we have to imagine;

15

the lawyers have to come in and set forth every

16

potential constitutional violation and set

17

forth every interpretation of the facts that

18

are potentially available, decide which ones

19

would be an unreasonable application of federal

20

law or -- or unreasonable finding to grant a

21

habeas -- you have to do the same thing to deny

22

one.

23

a totally new argument that wasn't made to the

24

state court at all and say you should deny

25

habeas on this totally new argument?

Can the state come in, in this

All right?

Could the state come in with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MS. WARREN:

I'm not sure that it

2

would be precluded from doing so.

3

certainly, that's the inquiry that the federal

habeas court would be -­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And,

So why do we

6

bother having state habeas anymore?

7

we just say don't -- have federal habeas only

8

and -­

9
10
11
12

MS. WARREN:

Why don't

Well, I think -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and assume that

the state will deny every habeas?
MS. WARREN:

I think -- I think an -­

13

an important point to -- to show where there is

14

not much daylight between the Petitioner's

15

argument and ours is that we are not suggesting

16

that that state habeas court lower opinion is

17

outlawed from consideration or that it has no

18

role in the process whatsoever.

19

In many cases, the very first place

20

and in many cases perhaps the very last place

21

the federal habeas court will look is to that

22

reasoned decision below, but not because it

23

presumes those lower court reasons are the

24

reasons of the last court that's adjudicated

25

the claim on the merits, but simply to see

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

whether a reasonable basis exists to sustain

2

the denial of relief.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You don't think

4

that there's more respect for a state court, to

5

let them make their own decisions?

6

what we're doing is imagining what they would

7

have said, instead of just asking them.

8
9

MS. WARREN:

Because

Your Honor, to the extent

there's any discomfort with the imagining or

10

the hypotheticals, that line has already been

11

drawn by this Court in Richter.

to the respect point, has -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But Georgia,

There was

14

absolutely no reasoned decision anywhere there.

15

We had to do something.

MS. WARREN:

That is correct.

But the

17

textual analysis that this Court engaged as to

2254 applies equally here.

19

text, of the same statute, and there's no

20

principled basis for deviating from that

textual analysis when it is applied to the

22

summary denial on the merits by the Georgia

23

Supreme Court.

24

It's the same -­

where a reasoned opinion will ensue, and then

5

the Georgia Supreme Court, which will analyze

7

There are two courts that will always

And so to suggest that the Georgia

8

Supreme Court should be written out altogether,

9

I think, is also an affront to federalism and

10

to comity.

11

that the Georgia Supreme Court has adopted

12

those lower state court reasonings similarly is

13

an affront to federalism.

Where is the question

of -- of Georgia law that is implicated here?

16

It would be one thing if it were generally

understood in Georgia that a summary affirmance

18

by the state supreme court does not necessarily

adopt the reasoning of the lower court.

would be another thing if it was the rule in

the opposite is true.

proposition that every time the Georgia Supreme

reasoning, it takes the time to issue a

reasoned dissent.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, didn't Ylst tell

7

us what we should generally draw from silence?

8

It just says the maxim is that silence implies

9

consent, not the opposite.

Courts generally

10

behave accordingly, not always, but generally

11

affirming when -- without further discussion

12

when they agree, not when they disagree, with

13

the reasons given below.

14

And that was -- you know, there was a

15

different context.

16

procedural versus merits.

17

reasoning was not limited to -- to the context.

18

It was -- it was a more general understanding

19

of what silence means, or generally should be

20

taken to mean, with respect to state supreme

21

courts.

22

As you say, it was
But that basic

Why wasn't it right?
MS. WARREN:

Well, Justice Kagan, a

23

few reasons.

First, this was a pre-AEDPA

24

determination.

25

doctrine that is restricted to help federal

It's a judge-made prudential

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

courts ascertain whether it can hear federal

2

claims, not how to conduct substantive habeas

3

review.

4

And so it very well may be the case

5

that in that context -- in that context that

6

it's helping federal habeas courts ascertain

7

whether later state summary adjudications have

8

vitiated a state court bar, that silence does

9

imply consent.

10

That is not the case here.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you do

11

when you're presenting an argument in these

12

cases?

13

respond primarily or only to the state court

14

decision, or do you say we've got four more

15

good arguments, and so we're going to put all

those in our brief?

Do you just -- you, the -- the state,

MS. WARREN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I am

18

not exactly sure of the practice.

state court has said below, but I cannot say

21

for sure.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't

What if the -- the

23

state supreme court says, you know, we think

24

that this opinion is clearly wrong, but we're

ground.

5

this; we're just going to say affirm.

6

but the thing that I'm thinking is this habeas

7

petitioner has never been presented with this

8

alternative argument.

9

It wasn't, but it could have

And -- and we're going to affirm on that

But -­

So it might be that this habeas

10

petitioner would have a really good response to

11

this alternative argument, but he doesn't even

12

know that it's in the case.

13

unfair to the habeas petitioner, to say your

14

petition is denied, not to tell him why, even

15

though he's never been given the chance to

16

respond to this new reasoning.

17

MS. WARREN:

That seems quite

Well, I think Harrington

18

versus Richter already says that the -- the

19

petitioner's burden still remains the same,

20

which is to say that there is no reasonable

basis on which that court could have based its

denial of relief.

14

be the situation where the issue, the ground

15

for affirmance was never raised at all below or

16

where the ground for affirmance that -- that is

17

attributed to the state supreme court is

18

different from the basic ground for affirmance

19

that was addressed by the district court -- by

20

the -- by the lower state court?

21

MS. WARREN:

Well, I think that all

22

this Court has to do is apply what it has

23

already found in Harrington versus Richter, and

24

then that has laid out the process for how the

25

federal habeas court would treat the Georgia

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

Supreme Court's summary adjudication on the

2

merits there.

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, you know,

4

of course, in this Court, we say our summary

5

affirmances are not necessarily an endorsement

6

of the -- of the lower court's reasoning.

7

That's well established in this Court's

8

jurisprudence.

9

And as I understood Mr. Olive, he said

10

it might be a different case if that were

11

clearer in Georgia.

12

to now confront 50 states or X number of states

13

with rules or something in their precedents or

14

a footnote saying we do not necessarily endorse

15

all the lower court reasoning, just exactly as

16

this Court has done for itself.

So let's say we are going

17

Then what?

18

MS. WARREN:

I think if a state has a

19

clear rule, either by case law or a rule by its

20

court, that -- that gives further direction as

21

to how to treat summary affirmances, that those

22

would be honored.

But where -­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MS. WARREN:

Supreme Court has no rule, has -- has no clear

binding practice that is consistently

2

indicative of what it intends by summary

3

affirmances, that the summary affirmance of the

4

Georgia Supreme Court should not be treated the

5

exact opposite as the way this Court and other

6

federal courts treat their own summary

7

affirmances.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
difference.

Well, there is a big

I mean, first, Harrison is

10

different because in Harrison there was no

11

decision of the state court that you could look

12

to.

13

Obviously, the federal habeas court

14

has to try to figure out some theory as to what

15

they were holding.

16

here where there is a decision of the court.

17

That isn't the question

And where a habeas court later takes

18

that decision as being the decision from the

19

state that led to this person's being deprived

20

of liberty, what does that say about whether

21

the summary affirmance should be treated as

22

precedent for state law?

23

think.

It says nothing, I

24

When you have us saying ours should

25

not be treated that way, of course, we don't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

want it as a precedent binding every court in

2

the nation.

3

our summary affirmance does not mean that we

4

agree, of course, they don't want it to be

5

binding throughout the circuit.

6

When a federal appeals court says

But this decision before us has

7

nothing to do with that.

We can say this

8

district could set -- the appeals court in

9

Georgia has made the decision that is leading

10

to his deprivation of liberty and ignore the

11

summary affirmance without saying anything

12

about whether the summary affirmance is

13

precedent or not, a matter not before us.

14

Isn't that so?

15

MS. WARREN:

Justice Breyer, you're

16

correct that I don't think this Court has to

17

make a judgment as to what the summary

18

affirmances mean in Georgia, but at that point

19

I would -- I would ask the Court to go back to

20

the text because the text requires application

21

of 2254(d) to the adjudication of the claim

Well, I would certainly

that Ylst's purpose, as it was originally

conceived, is consistent with and complementary

19

to the inquiry that this Court later set out in

20

Harrington versus Richter.

21

And so using Ylst for the purpose that

22

Ylst was originally intended, which is to

23

identify the state court bars and to preserve

24

them, which is a probable assumption, where

25

silence may very well equal consent, that -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

58
1

that respects comity in its own way by ensuring

2

that state court procedural bars are not

3

vitiated by later state court summary opinions.

4

Here, asking this Court to make sure

5

that the Georgia Supreme Court or any higher

6

state court of the land does not have infirm

7

reasoning imputed on it when they are faced

8

with both reasonable and unreasonable bases on

9

which to sustain the denial of relief also

10

serves comity and is the best -- and is in

11

service of federalism and comity in that set of

12

cases where it matters the most, when that

13

lower state court may contain an infirmity.

14

And for that reason, the presumption

15

that is the thread running throughout

those final decisions of the state courts and

6

not look behind those.

an argument that we'd look behind that kind of

8

ruling.

9
10
11

I mean, I haven't heard

So what exactly have we accomplished
here?
MR. OLIVE:

I think what the state's

12

rule creates is a maze trying to figure out

13

what a summary affirmance means in a state,

14

what a discretionary denial of an appeal means,

15

what a -- you know, what do any of them mean

16

when the -- when the Ylst rule applies across

17

the board?

18
19
20

The Ylst rule says a silence means
agreement.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So even if a state

21

supreme court says we affirm the judgment, and

22

-- and uses language exactly like this Court

23

uses, but not necessarily all the reasonings,

24

and there may be additional reasons beyond

25

those that the lower court provided, we would

look behind that?

2

suggestion?

3

federalism and comity?

4

Is that -- is that the

And how does that fit with

MR. OLIVE:

What Ylst holds is that

5

we're trying to figure out what's most

6

probable, not necessarily what is absolutely

7

right, what is most probable.

8
9
10

And we think the court said what's
most probable is agreement with the lower
court.

It can -­

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Even when the court

12

-- supreme court disclaims -­

13

MR. OLIVE:

14

-- be rebutted in your

example -­

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

16

MR. OLIVE:

-- that?

Pardon?

In your example,

17

that is a circumstance which could lead to

18

rebuttal.

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

20

MR. OLIVE:

21
22

Okay.

And in the Georgia Supreme

-JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And -- and in that

23

case then, what have we accomplished is my

24

question, if you could answer that?

25

MR. OLIVE:

You mean by just having a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

rubber stamp that says "not for the same

2

reasons"?

3
4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It's just going to

be a slightly different rubber stamp.

5

MR. OLIVE:

Well, I think -­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We've created a

7

simple rule and states could decide what they

8

want to do.

9

Correct?

MR. OLIVE:

I see my time is up.

10

love to say "correct" to that.

11

(Laughter.)

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

14

I'd

Well, since -­

I'd say correct and

stop if I were you.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would least

16

-- at least like to give you the final word.

17

You can take a sentence.

MR. OLIVE:

19

(Laughter.)

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

counsel.

Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you,

The case is submitted.
