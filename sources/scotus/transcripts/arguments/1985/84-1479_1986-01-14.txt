that important factual finding is that the statements,

there is this terrible friction that results between

1

I would like at this point to make very clear

2

that I do not wish to come before this Court and suggest

3

that the federal writ of habeas corpus is unimportant.

4

He recognize that it is a very important protection and

5

clearly, other than in Fourth Amendment, litigation,

6

where a state prisoner does generally not have the right

7

to come into federal court of a federal habeas corpus

8

application, in the other areas of constitutional law we

9

do not dispute that where a constitutional issue

10

affects, may affect the validity of a state criminal

11

conviction, a state prisoner should have one full and

12

fair opportunity to come into federal court and have the

13

federal court examine that constitutional issue before a

14

conclusive presumption of finality attaches to that

15

state court criminal conviction.

16

What we are asking the Court to reject in this

17

case is the suggestion by the Second Circuit Court of

18

Appeals that what habeas corpus really is is a never

19

ending merry go round ride,

available to state habeas --

MR. KARTAGENER;

it says is the court need not entertain the successive

Rut we suggest that the whole purpose of that

statute,

when read in accord with the Congressional

intent, which is shown in the Senate report

that

accompanies it,

was to have that statute interpreted as

11

M R. KARTAG5NEF;

I would certainly agree with

20

that position, Your Honor,

and in our brief we argue as

a final subsection that, even if the ends of justice

22

analysis were to be considered extant, notwithstanding

23

the Congressional mandatory legislation of 1966,

we

24

should still prevail under that analysis.

Because

25

Why?

the important concerns that
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the Court has so recently articulata:? in the araa of

2

habeas corpus -- the need for finality, the need for a

3

conclusion in state criminal litigation, the important

4

need to have the state criminal trial be the main bout

5

and not just the preliminary bout in a long line of

6

knock-down, drag-oat fights in the federal courts on

7

constitutional issues -- there is a very important other

8

reason why that end of justice argument would support

9

us.

10

And that is because there was a strong

11

suggestion in the amendatory legislation of

12

and this is in the Senate report, which we cite at

13

length in our brief -- that the purpose of the amendment

14

in 1966 was to bring a greater degree of finality to

15

state habeas corpus applications, and indeed a qualified

16

application of the doctrine of res judicata, which as

17

this Court is well aware until that time was essentially

18

missing, almost in its entirety, from habeas corpus.

19

1966 that

And I would suggest that, we're not really

20

asking for res judicata principles to be applied under

21

our rule in this case, not in the strictest sense,

22

because res judicata, if strictly applied, would say

23

that if you have brought one habeas corpus application

24

and you left out a claim and you come back into court

25

later with a new claim, under pure res judicata

That’s really not what we're arguing about

here.

4

asking the Court to io in exercising

5

capacity over the lower federal courts, just as the

6

Court did in Sanders in interpreting Section 2244 as it

consistent with that Congressional intent, consistent

10

with all of the important concerns that the Court has

11

articulated about the need to bring finality to habeas

there are two areas where you might allow a repetition

And I think it's a very important two exceptions, a very

7

important gualification, because I think one of the

8

things that would certainly bother the Court in a habeas

corpus situation is if we’re dealing with a claim that

10

reslly raised some shadow of a doubt as to the innocence

11

of the state prisoner, or some claim that truly goes to

12

the accuracy, integrity, or validity of the factfinding

process.
And what we suggest as the exceptions is the

14
15

What about the finding of the trial

6

they’re clearly erroneous?

7

MB. WEBER:

You say

Your Honor, we haven’t argued

that

8

that is a clearly erroneous finding.

What we believe is

9

that the state court found a mixed conclusion of law end

10

fact that the statements were voluntary and unsolicited

11

and spontaneous, and that the .federal court on a habeas

12

petition could re-examine that finding.

13

But what’s more important, perhaps, is that a

14

finding of spontaneity or voluntariness of

15

unsolicitedness perhaps, if you will, does not answer

16

the inquiry that Henry requires of the federal court on

17

18

10

Accordingly, if Wilson's case were tried in

11

1985 there could be no doubt that his testimony would

12

not be admissible at trial.

13

below should be affirmed because, in the light of Henry,

14

that evidence was erroneously admitted in 1970 at

15

Wilson's trial.

The decision of the court

My argument today will consist of two points*

16
17

First, it was entirely appropriate for the Court of

18

Appeals and the district court to entertain Wilson's

19

current petition in light of United States against

20

Henry, which was an intervening authority with direct

21

and substantial bearing on Wilson's constitutional

22

claim.

23

Second, in correctly entertaining Wilson's

24

current application, the court below complied with

25

Section 2254(d) by giving due regard to the finding of

9

With regard to the first point. Section

10

2244(b) does not provide a basis for the federal courts

11

to foreclose Wilson's habeas corpus petition, because

12

the statute is purely permissive, and, second, because

13

under the circumstances of this case, the court below

14

correctly exercised its discretion to entertain the

15

petition.
