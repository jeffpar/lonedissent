ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. J. MICHAEL CODY, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

Mr. Attorney General?

MR. CODY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

7

On the night of December 30, 1978, Joy Faulk and

8

Charles Browning were shot to death in a rural area of

9

Rutherford County, Tennessee.

10

The Respondent Clark was indicted by the grand

11

jury on two counts of first degree murder.

12

trial, he was convicted of the first degree murder of Joy

13

Faulk and given life imprisonment and the second degree murder

14

of Charles Browning and given ten years in prisonment.

15
16

The malice instructions were not challenged at
trial, but later challenged on appeal.

17
18

Following a jury

The state appellate court affirmed the jury verdict
and the Tennessee Supreme Court denied permission to appeal.

19

The petition for the writ of habeas corpus, which

20

alleged the malice instructions violated due process pursuant

21

to Sandstrom versus Montana, was granted by the district

22

court and this affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth

23

Circuit.

24
25

This grant of the petition for a writ of certiorari
is limited to the question of whether error in the trial

court's jury instructions on malice was harmless beyond a

2

reasonable doubt.
The facts in this case are extremely important.

3
4

Joy Faulk and the Respondent had been involved in a stormy

5

relationship prior to Faulk terminating that relationship

6

several months before the slayings.

7

Following their breakup, the Respondent threatened

8

on six different occasions to kill Faulk if he ever caught

9

her with another man.

10

Two weeks before the slayings, the Respondent

11

borrowed the murder weapon, a 25 caliber automatic pistol,

12

after untruthfully indicating that his own gun had been stolen.

13

Several days before the slayings, the Respondent

14

spoke to Browning's wife for the purpose of determining the

15

relationship and during the course of the conversation he

16

twice stated that he wanted to find out about Browning and

17

Faulk's relationship before he did what he had to do.

18

at the time he made those statements, he was in the possession

19

of the murder weapon.

And,

20

Now, prior to the commission of the crimes, the

21

Respondent's truck was observed pursuing Browning's truck

22

in which Faulk and her two daughters were passengers along

23

the road.

24

pulled into a private driveway, either to let the Respondent

25

pass or to seek safety.

Some ten miles from this observation, Browning

1

At that time, the Respondent parked his truck

2

immediately behind Browning's, thereby blocking any escape,

3

and left the lights on, then immediately went to the Browning

4

truck, put his pistol inside the cab and fired the weapon

5

at least four times at point-blank range.

6

Browning, who was, of course, the driver of the

7

truck, had a fully loaded 22 caliber pistol in his right

8

pants pocket.

9

the evidence is clear was positioned so that it could not

10

11

from his pocket before he was shot.

He could not have removed the pistol

12

Browning was shot once in the head from a distance

13

of six to eight inches and Faulk was shot three times, twice

14

in the head and once in the left shoulder, from a distance

15

of less than 18 inches.

16

were obliterated by the head wounds in this case.

Respondent fired his weapon almost immediately after causing

21

was playing, the headlights were on, the driver's window

22

was down, and the passenger's window was up.

23

Browning's foot was still on

The motor in the truck was on, the radio

And, finally, after the Respondent fled the scene

24

of the murder, Faulk's two daughters who miraculously not

25

injured in the shooting, crawled over the bodies and were
5

1

found wandering around the roadway seeking assistance.
Shortly thereafter the Respondent led the police

2
3

on a high-speed chase at which time he discarded the murder

4

weapon prior to his apprehension by the police.

5

That night and at the trial, Joy Faulk's daughter

6

identified the Respondent as the individual responsible for

7

killing her mother and Browning.

8
9

Now, the primarily issue litigated at the trial
of this case was the identity of the murderer.

The Respondent

10

sought to prove that someone else did it.

He mentioned two

11

other individuals that he thought did it.

But, given the

12

overwhelming evidence that he had committed the murder, the

13

Respondent, who did not testify, also attempted to say that

14

if he did it he was temporarily insane, he was voluntarily

15

intoxicated, he had amnesia and didn't remember it at the

16

time.

17

The jury instructions given in this case by the

18

trial judge were extensive and went into the first and second

19

degree murders and the elements of those offenses, told the

20

jury to consider the instructions as a whole, that the state

21

had the burden of proof, the Defendant had the presumption

22

of innocence, but the court gave the two Sandstrom type

23

instructions, one which said homicides are presumed to be

24

malicious in the absence of evidence to rebut, but that

25

rebuttal evidence could be direct or circumstantial and either

from the state or from the Defendant.
And, secondly, if a deadly weapon is used under

3

certain circumstances, then malice could be presumed to

4

support a second degree murder conviction unless it is

5

rebutted by other facts and circumstances.

6

QUESTION:

General Cody, would you say that the

7

instructions here were like those in the case of Connecticut

8

versus Johnson and were conclusive presumptions or were these

9

instructions, in your view, rebuttable presumptions?

MR. CODY:

Justice, they were very —

I do not believe there is any con­

The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals held that

17

these instructions did not violate Sandstrom and, further,

18

that the Respondent could not have been prejudiced in view

19

of his sole defenses of non-participation and insanity.

20

The federal district court, however, found that

21

the element of malice was a disputed issue at trial because

22

of the defenses and refused to find it harmless.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Did you tell us, Mr. Attorney General,

that there was no objection to the instructions?

MR. CODY:

The first degree murder was the murder

of Joy Faulk, the woman who was shot twice in the head and

once in the shoulder.

Respondent's former girlfriend who he had said, if I ever

catch you out with someone I will kill you.

And, of course, this was the

Browning, which was the second degree murder con­

7

viction — It was based upon that he was the person that

8

she was found with on that occasion.

9

QUESTION:

I take it the harmless error inquiry

10

would be whether there was no possibility or no reasonable

11

possibility that the first degree murder conviction might

12

have been a second degree murder conviction?

13

MR. CODY:

I think the inquiry could go to both,

14

but I beliteve that it is very clear in this case that the

15

overwhelming — First of all, on the first degree charge,

16

there is no question that premeditation and deliberation

17

and willfulness were all properly charged.

18

And, under Tennessee law, voluntary intoxication,

19

for instance, is not a defense to second degree murder.

20

It is only a defense to premeditation and deliberation aspects.

21

So, we believe that any jury which, under these

22

facts, would have found that the murder was committed pre-

23

meditatively and deliberately and wilfully.

24

multiple shots within the cab of the truck at point-blank

25

range would have also found malice and could have certainly

9

both victims were seated — there could be no indication.

Self-defense was never

If the Court please, the State of Tennessee submits

11

first that the jury instructions in this case which incorporate

12

a rebuttable presumption on the element of malice alone,

13

are subject to analysis under the harmless error doctrine.

14

Second, that the existence of malice was not placed

15

in dispute by either of the two defenses raised by the

16

Respondent.

17

And, third.and finally, in any event, the evidence

18

of malice in this case, on the facts and the entire trial,

19

is overwhelming and that the Respondent was not prejudiced

20

by the instructions.

21

QUESTION:

Well, to urge — Your first point is

22

that it is subject to harmless error analysis, that assumes

23

there was error.

Is it conceded that there was error?

24

MR. CODY:

Well, Justice —

25

QUESTION:

Or do you say there is no problem in

1

2

the instruction if there is no issue about malice?
MR. CODY:

It is difficult to answer that question.

3

We did not think that there was any basic error in this

4

rebuttable presumption, but the court has granted certiorari

5

only on the question of whether it was harmless and that

6

is the reason that we only raised that point.

7

QUESTION:

So, you are suggesting that the narrow

question presented here is the harmless error question?

And, we

think that an erroneous rebuttable presumption on malice
in this case shouldn't be in any way classified as error
so basic to denying a fair trial as to require an automatic
reversal regardless of the facts and legal significance of
the defenses.
And, we believe if the Court analyzes the record
in this case and the evidence and defenses presented that
it would find a harmless error clearly and reverse the

of Appeals.
With the Court's permission, I would like to leave
what remaining time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. LARKIN, JR., ESQ.

2

AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER

3

MR. LARKIN:

4
5

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Court has often recognized the harmless error

6

doctrine serves salutary purposes in the criminal process.

7

It is also clear from the Court's decisions that

8

an erroneous jury instruction may generally be analyzed for

9

its harmlessness in the particular facts of a given case.

10

The question here is whether the Court ought to

11

create an exception from those rules for instructions that

12

have an erroneous presumption.

13

is rebuttable, but the Court has looked at both rebuttal

14

and conclusive presumptions in the cases preceding this one

15

such as Sandstrom and Connecticut versus Johnson.

16

In this case, the presumption

It is our position there is no reason to adopt

17

the per se rule in this area.

18

that the analysis that the Court followed in United States

19

versus Frady directly controls this case.

20

And, it is also our position

The question in Frady came up in the context of

21

whether or not the Defendant had been prejudiced because

22

he hadn't objected at trial to the instruction.

23

But, the question of whether the Defendant is prejudice:

24

is simply the flip side of the question of whether the error

25

is harmless.
a

12

So, the analysis the Court followed in Frady should

2

apply here.
Two aspects of the decision in Frady are quite

important.

5

the record to decide whether or not Frady, in fact, had been

6

prejudiced.

7

8
9
10
11

First, the Court found no difficulty in analyzing

And, second, the Court found that for three related
reasons he was not.
The first was that the government's proof in that
case of malice was overwhelming.

That is also the case here.

The second reason was the erroneous instruction

12

did not affect the defense in that case of non-participation

13

that Frady had raised.

14

That is also the case here.

Neither the defense of non-participation, voluntarily

15

intoxication, insanity or amnesia could have been affected

16

by this instruction.

17

And, finally, the last reason given in Frady why

18

the error there was not prejudicial was that the jury found

19

that Frady had premeditated and deliberated and that, too,

20

is the case here.

21

22

QUESTION:

against Johnson, wasn't it?

23

MR. LARKIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Frady was decided before Connecticut

That is correct, Your Honor.
Why do you think it wasn't cited by

any of the opinions in Connecticut against Johnson?

MR. LARKIN:

That I don't know, Your Honor, but

If it is controlling here, you would

4

have thought that it would have been cited by one side or

5

the other.

MR. LARKIN:

6
7

it hasn't been overruled.
The question analyzing Frady was whether the erroneous

8

Clearly, for that reason at least,

instruction had affected the verdict in that case.

The Court

10

was able to find that it did not.

11

of different reasons for it.

12

reasons that should apply in a case such as this one.

13

The Court gave a variety

Those are the same types of

Now, as Frady demonstrates, the error that occurs

14

in a case like this with an erroneous instruction of this

15

type, is not a fundamental defect in the trial process that

16

completely deprives someone of a semblance of a trial.

17

The instructions given in this case have been used

18

in Tennessee murder prosecutions since the time of Andrew

19

Jackson.

20

and federal cases, for some time thereafter, and this Court

21

had even approved a similar type of instruction in the Allen

22

case.

They were used elsewhere nationwide, both in state

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. LARKIN:

25

Does that make them right?
Not necessarily.

The rationale that

we understand the Court to have adopted in Sandstrom is that
14
r*n k

\f

1

there is a risk that the jury may misconstrue these types

2

of instructions.
But, that doesn't mean that they are necessarily

3
4

to be equated with a directed verdict.

5

this take place along a continuum.

6

is an instruction that allows a jury to infer an ultimate

7

fact from a basic fact.

8

constitutional problem with that type of instruction so long

9

as the evidence is sufficient to support it and so long as

Instructions like

At one end of the continuum

The Court has never found any

10

the type of inference the jury is allowed to draw is one

11

that is entirely rational.

12

At the other end of the spectrum is a case where

13

you have an actual directed verdict, either in whole as where

14

the case is not allowed to go to the jury at all, or in part

15

where the case is allowed to go to the jury on one or more

16

issues.

17

The problem with an instruction like the type that

18

was found in Sandstrom is not that it necessarily amounts

19

to a directed verdict, it is just that there is some risk

20

that the jury may misconstrue how it should be applied.

21

But, where the evidence is overwhelming, it seems

22

to us quite unlikely that the jury is not going to be swayed

23

by that type of evidence.

24
25

If it is a problem of uncertainty, certainly isn't
present where there are other findings by the jury that are

For example, in Frady, there was

the case here.

That is also

4

The erroneous presumption in this case affected

5

only the instruction on malice, not the instructions on willfulne S £

6

premeditation and deliberation.

7

The additional findings the jury made in this case,

8

therefore, show that they necessarily found malice regardless

9

of whether or not the error was brought to their attention

10

or otherwise.

11

Secondly, it is also not the type of error where

12

an inquiry is inherently impractical.

13

to make that type of inquiry in Frady and the lower courts,

14

both state and federal, have found that they are able to

15

distinguish cases where there are erroneous presumptions,

16

conclusive or rebuttable.

17

cases where they are harmless from the cases where they are

18

pre judicial.

QUESTION:

This Court was able

They are able to distinguish the

Mr. Larkin, can I interrupt?

It is

20

pretty much the same question I asked before, but are you

21

saying it is perfectly clear that they would have found him

22

not guilty or they could not have found a murder one conviction

23

to be a murder two conviction?

24

me.

25

to murder one on both victims, but the jury apparently didn't.

That is the thing that puzzles

I would have thought the evidence is overwhelming as

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

MR. LARKIN:

Well, I would explain that the same

2

way the trial judge explained it here.

3

contains the trial judge's order denying the motion for a

4

new trial and making sentences consecutive.

5

Page 132 in the record

There he said he found that there were two cold-blooded

6

killings, one premediated and the other flowing out of the

7

first.

8
9

It seems to me what happened here in this case
was the jury thought that the killing of Faulk was premeditated,

10

probably largely because there had been numerous threats

11

made by the Respondent that he would kill her if he found

12

her with another man and also because she was shot multiple

13

times and Browning was shot only once.

14

Now, the evidence would be sufficient to support

15

premeditation and deliberation as to both, but what probably

16

accounts for what happened here is just that the jury thought

17

premeditation and deliberation probably requires thinking

18

about it for a long time.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

If that is true then, maybe the harm

of the presumption was that it was prejudicial as to the
one that was found guilty of second degree murder.

Maybe

without the instruction they would have found manslaughter
or something else.
MR. LARKIN:

Well, there was no basis in the other

jury instructions for allowing them to reduce the second

It is clear that there was no evidence presented

11

Respondent offered in this respect was a statement that Mitzi

13

two people who picked her up that night after the killing,

had guns and they were fighting.

that there was any type of fight there.

On the stand, Mitzi denied

So, the only evidence he has that would justify

anything less than a second degree murder conviction was

this one particular type of hearsay statement.

20

QUESTION:

Did the Defendant undertake to prove

21

an alibi in any way that he wasn't there and that two other

22

people had committed the crime?

23

MR. LARKIN:

That was his primary defense at trial,

24

yes, Your Honor.

25

was weakened by the fact that neither he nor anyone else

Of course, the alibi he tried to present

were able to pinpoint where he was, and that is because he

2

said he had amnesia at the time.

Also, the two people who were supposed to have

4

committed this crime, Joy Faulk's ex-husband, Sam, and Charles

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT DANIEL, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. DANIEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

5

The Petitioner takes the position based upon a

6

view of the facts which I think Justice Marshall's last question

7

kind of pinpointed.

8
9

They view the facts only in their view of how it
had to be from their standpoint of looking at it rather than

10

looking at it in a multitude of ways in which a jury can

11

consider.

12

If they are arguing sufficiency of evidence, that

13

is one thing, but they are not.

14

raised at issue.

15

That is not the point here

And, before I go into the matters that I want to

16

specifically address for the point of view of my own presenta­

17

tion, are some matters which the Petitioner has stated here

18

which I think need to be touched upon.

19

First of all, they said the malice instruction

20

was not challenged at the trial.

So, there is no question about any waiver aspects

Now, they have stated here as to the facts, their

view of the facts, and just to give you an illustration,

they say someone was following them for ten miles.

interpretation of what actually occurred as to whether or

standpoint of looking at it.

is all I am saying.

No, Your Honor, I do not.

We concede

2

it was great evidence, substantial evidence viewed from one

3

standpoint, but not so overwhelming as to dictate the result,

4

and clearly, I think, is the indication of Justice Marshall's

be that concrete as the Petitioner takes the position of

Now, what we suggest and what we have submitted
throughout the case is — And, they state again that the

12

the testimony of two psychiatrists who testified in his behalf,

They said that if, in fact, he committed the crimes

22

he was not guilty by reason of insanity and this was the

defense we relied upon as well as the fact that we, from

the outset, contended, number one, Mr. Clark, the Defendant,
had no recollection of the events, had insanity, therefore

could not present an alternative version out of his own mouth.

2

The only witness to it was a little girl, a six-year old

3

girl, whose testimony, by the statement of the trial judge,

4

was so contractive and impeached, and he said impeached,

5

that he allowed into evidence out-of-court statements that

6

she had made in which she had said specifically, and there

7

are other witnesses who agreed, that they are fighting, they

8

have guns, they are fighting, so that there was clearly a

9

fight going on.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Daniel, you spoke a moment ago of

11

the psychiatric testimony supporting your client's amnesia

12

defense.

13

about saying that if he was there he has totally forgotten

14

or has no recollection and still, if he was there, he might

15

have had the malice required for first degree murder.

16
17

Do you see anything inconsistent between that sort
of amnesia you are talking about and the intent to kill?

18
19

I wouldn't think there is anything inconsistent

MR. DANIEL:

Amnesia in and of itself was not

20

What I am saying is our evidence was — our

Can you cite me anything the psychiatrist said that he lacked

malice?

5

MR. DANIEL:

6

QUESTION:

7

10

That he was incapable of possessing

malice?

8
9

Well —

MR. DANIEL:

What they said was that he — as I

pointed out before, that he was incapable of, in their
opinion --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DANIEL:

Of conforming to the law.
Of comforming.

And, as I presented

13

and as I think we presented it to the jury in the fashion

14

that his conduct was such that it could not be voluntary

15

and that is the essence of that defense, and we used it straight

16

out of the Tennessee requirements so that he had to give

17

his opinion exactly as the Tennessee law requires on that.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

And that the Tennessee courts have interpreted
as going for voluntary, saying it cannot be voluntary unless
it is a produce of the free will.

If he cannot control it,

he did not have the intent and cannot conform his conduct.
It is the determination that he didn't have the intent necessary
for malice.

MR. DANIEL:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. DANIEL:

I apologize for getting off on that.
I mean, it is your case.
I respectfully agree with Your Honor.

4

I was simply trying to respond to a matter that they raised

5

there.

6

What we suggest to the Court and what we submit

7

and argue in this case is that the jury,here clearly had

8

before it a contested issue; that is there was a contested

9

issue we contested all the way through.

That is that there

10

was fighting going on.

11

was malice from day one, from the opening shot and the opening

12

statement.

13

means possible that there were other explanations, there

14

were fights or there was provocation, principally that there

15

was no evidence as to what, in fact, had happened or how

16

it happened.

17

on the issue itself went to and said that you are to presume

18

intent, you are to presume malice and malice it defined as

19

intent.

20

here we had a defendant that was incapable of even recollecting

21

the events, assuming he was there, could not present any

22

evidence contrary to this.

23

We contested whether or not there

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

QUESTION:

Now, on the question of malice, does

2

this record show with respect to the examination by the

3

psychiatrist whether he had any recollection of having

4

threatened to do these killings?

5

MR. DANIEL:

6

QUESTION:

No, there was no evidence to that.
The psychiatrist didn't ask him whether

7

he recalled that when they are dealing with his capacity

8

for recollection?

9

MR. DANIEL:

The psychiatrist, as I recall it,

10

in essence said that he had no — He said he would never

11

have done anything like that and had no recollection of ever

12

having threatened or having done anything that would harm.

13

And, indeed, the lay witnesses themselves said,

14

that although he made some threats at times he also on other

15

occasions said I would never do anything to her, I would

16

never hurt her, anything of this nature.

17

So, the psychiatric testimony did not anywhere

18

state in any way, shape or form that he ever threatened or

19

claimed to have harbored any intent to harm her.

20

QUESTION:

The presumption, of course, was rebuttable.

21

Let's assume that you had no psychiatric evidence whatever.

22

Do you think the evidence in this case would have rebutted

23

the presumption of malice?

24

MR. DANIEL:

Do you mean the evidence in the sense

5

times, he followed her car down the road, he fired three

shots into her at close range.

are you suggesting that unless you had had the defense of

8

insanity that the evidence did not rebut successfully your

9

position?

10

MR. DANIEL:

That would leave you with all the

Oh, no.

In spite of those facts,

Your Honor, please, if the

insanity defense were not there, our claim would be identical.

Don't have to rely on insanity.

That

15

is in addition to the other defense, because — this is what

16

I was going into to begin with — the facts — First of all,

17

I don't agree with their statement of the facts, they are

18

reaching conclusions, but, nevertheless, the issue of intent

is one which to be submitted to the jury where we contest

If we didn't have the other evidence, statements,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

know, all these types of things.
There was absolutely nothing that the jury was

3
4

required to accept that would have required them to reach

5

the conclusion without this presumption that malice was intended.

6
7

Malice must go to the second degree as well as
the first degree offense.

8

Now, the Tennessee Supreme Court in the recent

9

case of State against Martin, which I attached a copy to

10

my brief in this Court, came out with a decision in which

11

in essence it has now acknowledged the erroneous presumption

here.

13

initiative even though the error wasn't raised because it

14

was a death penalty case.

15

It reversed a murder case in that one on its own

But, in that case, they have now conceded that

16

even though premediation is found specifically, that premeditatio

17

was clearly proved in the Martin case, but that this was

18

not sufficient to dictate a finding of malice and it reversed

19

on the issue of malice while finding premeditation was fully

20

established even though there were substantial eye-witnesses

21

to it, because it held that malice is a separate issue and

22

that malice in order to be found cannot be presumed under

23

its view of the law now and that since it cannot be presumed

24

it found that this was a separate issue which must be tried

25

by the jury upon proper instructions irrespective of whether
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the evidence with regard to premeditation was clearly suf­

2

ficient and that is what it found.

3

So, we submit to the Court that the Tennessee Court,

4

even now by its own findings, by its own determination, has

5

reached the position that we have taken throughout.

6

taken perhaps five years to get there because of various

7

different evolutions of the case, I guess, but now we submit

8

that their decision in that case is controlling here as to

9

the Tennessee law aspects of the case.

10

QUESTION:

It has

Do you suggest that there was not abundant

11

evidence on the malice issue apart from the instruction?

12

Just looking at the evidence, do you say this record does

not contain overwhelming evidence of malice?

15
16

MR. DANIEL:

I say it contains sufficient evidence

of malice just as in the case —

11

who admitted that she had been told by her father what to

who possibly could have committed the offense — then you

can draw certain conclusions.

MR. DANIEL:

Now you are challenging

No, if Your Honor please, you asked

20

me that question earlier, I believe, and my response, as

21

I understand it, was that it was not overwhelming.

22

is the position we have taken specifically in our brief,

23

it was not overwhelming, that it was sufficient.

24
25

That

If the question was simply sufficiency of the evidence
to establish the fact, I wouldn't argue that.

But, to say

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that it is overwhelming so that it dictates that conclusion,

2

I respectfully submit —

3

QUESTION:

Well, then, let's take your position

4

that it is merely sufficient to support the verdict.

5

why is it relevant to be dealing with these peripheral things

6

about suggesting that maybe he isn't really the guilty man.

7

MR. DANIEL:

Then,

Well, if Your Honor please, we contended

8

throughout the case that, number one — Our defense was this:

9

Number one, that we do not believe he committed the offense.

10

He said I would not have any reason to do it, I loved her,

11

I wouldn't have done it.

12

Number two, if, in fact, he committed the offense,

13

he did so as a result of mental illness over which he had

14

no voluntary control and over which his will had no — He

15

was unable to formulate the intent and had no ability to

16

conform his conduct, and, likewise, he did not have the intent,

17

malicious intent, irrespective of the mental element; that

18

it arose out of a fight, a provocation or a heat of passion

19

type of thing which would reduce it to manslaughter.

20

this is what our position was.

21

22
23
24
25

And,

If we were to go back and again try the case
tomorrow, I can't concede that my man committed something
he says I don't remember doing and wouldn't have done, I
loved her.
So, I am in the position of having to argue these
33

things without a client who can testify as to what occurred,

2

assuming he was there without conceding he was there.

MR. DANIEL:

That is his —
Did he love the man too that he killed?
No, Judge — Excuse me, Mr. Justice

8

Marshall, I am sure he didn't love the man and I wouldn't

9

say that.

I am simply saying as it respects the female victim

10

in the case, his position throughout and through all the

11

psychiatric was that he loved her and he couldn't conceive

12

of ever having had any reason or —

But, he didn't testify.

MR. DANIEL:

No, no, he didn't.

He couldn't.

He wasn't there or didn't recall any facts about the incident
and had no .way to present any evidence as to what actually
did occur.

There simply was no thread of direct evidence

as to what happened in this case.

It is simply a case of

circumstantial evidence in which the only witness who
allegedly present was admittedly impeached according to the
trial judge and testified as we mentioned before.
I further submit this and this is a point I think
is necessary here, the only issued that was raised here is
the harmless error, whether or not the evidence beyond a
reasonable doubt.

Both the district judge and the Sixth

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Circuit panels, who presumably are reasonable and competent,

2

experienced jurists, agreed with the position we have taken

3

here with regard to the effect of this error and their ruling

4

in this case related to a thorough consideration of the

5

factual aspects as the trial judge went at some length to

6

detail and point out.

7

This is a matter that the jurists who have considered this

8

matter before on this particular issue particularly went

9

into and evaluated.

10

I am not just coming out of left field.

Now, they did so under the harmless error doctrine.

11

They applied the Chapman rule of beyond a reasonable doubt

12

and since that has already been applied here, I respectfully

submit there is no reason for this Court to determine what
other type of harmless error rule could apply in some other
case under different facts and hypothetical circumstances.
We submit that the federal courts below have evaluated
the error based upon the Chapman rule, have reached the logical,
proper conclusions under that that rule and that should dictate
the holding of this Court in this case because of the fact
that they have made their ruling and the fact that they con­
sidered the issues presented to them in this case.

In this case, as I understand it, the Tennessee

the general rule on inconsistent verdicts of juries, the

MR. DANIEL:

Generally, I would say so, Your Honor.

They have not reversed simply because of an inconsistent

17

verdict.

in several different types of cases.

It was, according to the testimony, loaned to my client.

There were some other aspects of that which I have

That is correct.

17

We, again, submit that the controlling rule here

18

is the fact that we have right to rely upon the presumption

19

of innocence and that the Court cannot, in keeping with the

20

process and justices that have been followed by this Court

21

throughout, say that in essence directing a verdict on an

22

issue that is contested in a case and where they Defendant

23

cannot, due to his mental condition, is unable to, assuming

24

he even was there, testify, present evidence, rule that he

25

was obligated to rebut this type of evidence as the instruction

of innocence.

3

The presumption of innocence, if we had had that

alone -- simply go into court and say we want to rely on

5

a presumption of innocence, that that presumption alone should

6

have been enough to allow us to make the jury confront the

issues head on without a presumption telling them what they

are supposed to do unless we rebut it.

matter.

Circuit pointed out, we nevertheless submit that to adopt

the position taken by the Petitioner in this case is simply

do away with the presumption of innocence in a case where

15

there was strong evidence and allow the court simply to take

16

a position that, well, all right, we don't think there is

17

enough evdience and there is strong evidence on this, it

really makes no difference to us whether or not this issue —

the jury was allowed to fairly consider this issue without

ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. J. MICHAEL CODY, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

11

MR. CODY:

12

13

If the Court please, with your indulgence,

just mention two very short points.
One, the evidence in this case which I recited

14

in the opening statement, I believe, is taken almost verbatim

15

from the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals' findings.

16

And, with respect, I believe, to Justice Powell's

17

question about the psychiatrist's knowledge of the prior

18

threats, on page 129 of the record, Dr. Roger White,

19

Psychiatrist, is asked, would it have helped you to have

20

known past threats that this Defendant made toward the victim?

21

The answer was in this particular case and considering the

22

special nature of my contact with him, probably not.

23

opinion is based largely on my contact with him and his

24
25

My

response to a special form of examination.
QUESTION:
