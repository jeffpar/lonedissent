QUEST TON;

4

NR. SELLER:

Sorry.
I am sure as this Court is aware

5

from reading the briefs, there are a number of peculiar

6

aspects to this case.

7

that the case had been tried on the assumption that

8

Little Bird of

9

Number, and that it would violate Roy's First Amendment

The most peculiar, I think,

is

the Snow did not have a Social Security

11

t h e g o v e r a m e n t, but it came out on

that she in fact di d have a S ocd al Security V umber

14

tn e last day of

I think it is fair to say that when

15

trial

this

16

revelation was made Roy changed somewhat the nature of

17

his constitutional objections. This case had been brought

18

on the theory and the complaint charged

19

Amendment rights would be violated by having to*obtain

20

and provide a Social Security Number to the government in

21

order to get welfare benefits.

that Roy's First

But after the surprise revelation that despite

22

had led the District Court and

the government to

23

what Roy

24

believe , Little Bird in fact had a Social Security

25

N umber.

Poy claimed at that point that he was instead

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

concerned more with the use and dissemination of the
number rather than having to provide it to the
government.
In any event,

the District Court, held at the

conclusion of the trial that the Social Security Number
requirement was unconstitutional as applied to Roy, and
the court enjoined the government from denying welfare
benefits based on Roy's failure to provide that number to
the government.
Sow, in reaching its constitutional holding,
the District Court found as —
QUESTION;

How could the District Court have

enjoined the government from failing to provide Social
Security based on the failure to have furnished, the
number if the number had already been applied for?
ME. GELLER*

The District Court enjoyed the

government from using or disseminating the number that we
already had.

Of course, we hav

made a separate

objection to the injunction on the ground that cur use of
the number, which doesn't require any action or belief or
the part of the appellee, wouldn’t violate the First
Auendment.

th e District Court failed to have found

that there was a compelling government interest in using

had any less restrictive means available to it to

interfere with Poy's religious beliefs.
We heiievt that the District Court was plainly

wrong in the way it went about answering that question.

5

I think the District Court first of all failed to

6

appreciate that under this Court's free exercise cases

7

any less restrictive alternative imposed on the

government must be — must actually be capable of

achieving the governmental -- the compelling governmental

interest, at least to the same extent that the challenged

provision would achieve that interest.
