ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. BRADFIELD*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court*
This case involves the validity of Federal

12

Reserve Board rule applying the Bank Holding Company Act

13

to the corporate owners of certain banks, so-called

14

non-bank banks.

15

The Bank Holding Company Act applies to

16

companies that control a bank , which the Act defines as

17

any institution that both takes deposits the depositor

18

has a legal right to withdraw on demand, and engages in

19

the business of making commercial loans.

20

The first part of this definition ccncerning

21

demand deposit was added to the Act in

22

substituting for a broad charter test.

23

was added in 1970.

The Act prohibits the

have removed themselves from the regulation under the

11

Act when they act through national banks, state banks

12

and industrial banks to provide essential banking

13

services but eschew either the taking of demand deposits

14

or the making of commercial loans.

In response, a unanimous board of governors,

24

after rulemaking, defined the term "deposits" that the

depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand to

2

include NOW accounts.
QUESTION*

Nr. Bradfield, in 1956 when

3

Congress was considering adopting the definition, did

4

the Board propose to Congress that, in defining demand

5

deposits, that it include accounts which in actual

6

practice were paid on- demand?

7
8

9

Was that a suggestion made by the Board to
Congress in

'66?

HR. BRADFIELD*

That was a suggestion that was

10

made by — The Eoard took, the position, not in practice,

11

but that accounts that were payable by check, the

12

accounts that were payable on demand should be covered

13
14

.by the Act.
There’s a bit of history that I will get to.

15

Justice O'Connor, concerning industrial banks and their

16

proposal and the Board's proposal to cover —

17

QUESTION*

Yes, but my concern is to determine

18

whether it be the essence of the present Board rule and

19

position was one that was suggested by the Board itself

20

to Congress in

21

somewhat formalistic language by the Congress that

22

rejected —

23

1966 and resulted in the adoption of

MR. BRADFIELD*

The Board actually proposed

24

the language was deposits payable on demand.

25

language later became deposits that the depositor has a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

That

1

legal right to payment on demand
I do not think that there was any significance

2
3

to that change in language.

4

that Congress — The committee reports specifically say

5

that they were talking about demand deposits checking

6

accounts, and they used for emphasis, right after demand

7

deposits, they were using checking accounts.

8

don’t believe that they intended any specific technical

9

distinction.
QUESTION*

10

The legislative history

And I

Well, can we say in concluding that

11

Congress did not intend to pick up passbook savings

12

accounts?

13
14
15

ME. BBADFIELD;'

Yes, I believe that that is

correct, anc" the legislative history makes that clear.
QtESTIONs

Well, tell me whether you think

16

literally the Beard’s new definition of a NOW account is

17

broad enough to pick up passbook savings accounts.

18

MR. BBADFIELD*

The Board’s definition does

19

not pick up savings accounts.

20

savings accounts, and the legislative history makes it

21

clear that Congress was not intending to cover savings

22

accounts —

23

QUESTION*

It doesn’t apply to

Well, does the literal language of

24

the Board’s new definition cover — is it broad enough

25

to conceivably cover passbook savings accounts?
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

HR. BRADFIELD;

Well, technically it's

2

possible that it might cover that, but the, the

3

specifics of the definition do not cover passbook

4

savings accounts because they *re not payable by checks.

5

They are not payable by third-party means attainment,

6

and that’s the essence of what Congress was trying to

7

drive at; driving at those instruments that were money.

8
9

Checks are money.

When you go to the grocery

store, you give the clerk a check, you are creating

10

money at that point, and that *s what Congress was

11

concerned about; the combination of that characteristic

12

with the combination of

13

commercial lending.

14

— that characteristic with

And when the two are combined. Congress

fas

15

concerned that that created great power over resouces,

16

the potential for preferential lending, and that

17

Congress wanted to prohibit that and wanted to prohibit

18

the owners of banks from using those facilities f< r

19

their own benefit.

20

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Bradfield, if you turn to

21

page 2 of your petition for certiorari, and you probably

22

have this material at hand without turning to it, if you

23

look at the statutory definition in 1841(c), that a bank

24

means any institution which accepts deposits that the

25

depositor has a legal right tc withdraw on demand.
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And then, if you look right below below it to

2

the regulation, the regulation comes along and says

3

deposits that the depositor has a legal right to

4

withdraw on demand means any deposit that, as a matter

5

of practice, is payable on demand.

6

Now, I — that doesn’t strike me as being

7

within what Congress was talking about.

8

you have to have a legal right to withdraw on demand,

9

and the Board says no, it’s just a practical matter.

10

HE. BEADFIELDs

Congress says

This is because in practice --

11

There are two aspects of that.

12

the notice, it is not practical to give the notice.

13

notice — this is an instrument that is passed into the

14

hands of a third party.

15

One is that in practice
The

When passed into the third party and notice is

16

given, then that check is in effect dishonored by the

17

institution; and when dishonored by the institution, it

I8

completely impairs the ability of the institution to

19

function as a financial institution.

20

QUESTION*

Now, perhaps that's a sensible

21

answer to my question, but I had intended to get at

22

another point.

23

It seems to me — It seems to me when Congress

24

has said that — they're talking about deposits that the

25

depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand.
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

And

1

then the Board comes along and says this language that

2

Congress means, means any deposit that as a matter of

3

practice is payable on demand •

4

And it seems to me that that’s a significant

5

alteration of Congress’ meaning.

6

in pretty strict terras about the legal right to withdraw

7

on demand.

8
9

HR. BFADFIELDi

Congress was talking

I don’t — First, I would like

to go back to the Legislative history and point out that

10

Congress was talking about — I don’t think they were

11

making that technical distinction.

12

about what was a commerical bank, characterized a

13

commercial bank.

14

legislative history.

15

commercial bank.

16

Congress was talking

That’s what they said in the
They were driving at what was a

And this kind of instrument that creates money

17

was one of the characteristics of the commercial bank

18

that they were driving at.

19

mean, when you look at the whole legislative history in

20

perspective, they clearly didn’t mean to turn on one

21

technical aspect, to be able to undermine the whole

22

objectives of the —

23

QUESTION;

And th<y clearly didn’t

Hell why, then, did they use the

24

rather technical language "has a legal right to withdraw

25

on demand?"
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

HR. BRADFIELDi

1

Because they believe that that

2

was the equivalent of the demand deposit language that

3

was already in Board regulations at that time.

4
5

QUESTION*

But, yet, they didn't take the

Board regulations, they took this much stricter language.
HR. BRADFIELDi

6

But they explained that in the

7

legislative history.

8

technical basis for concluding that they intended

9

something different.

I don't think there is any

They looked at the Board

10

regulation that was in effect, in effect since 1933, and

11

what the Board had then defined, and defined a demand

12

deposit as any instrument that was subject to withdrawal

13

by check — by check.

14

withdrawal by check was a checking account and was a

15

demand deposit.

Any deposit that was subject to

And that the purpose of that was tc prevent

16
17

evasions of the basic prohibition of payment of interest

18

on demand deposits, and so that any instrument that was

19

withdrawable by check was a demand deposit.

20

what was in front of the Congress in 1966 when it

21

adopted the language.
Now, there was that shift.

22

That was

The Board

23

recommended demand deposit in its recommendation to the

24

Congress.

25

depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand, but

It was changed to deposit that the, that the

1 1
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

there’s no basis for concluding that they meant in that

2

technical distinction something far different.
And I would add to that, strengthen that, by

3
4

the very people who asked for this change -- the very

5

people who asked for this change were the industrial

6

bankers•

7

Now,

they said we io not offer checking

8

accounts.

We take certificates, savings certificates;

9

and we don't make commercial loans, we make consumer

10

loans.

11

and the Board had earlier then within the scope of the

12

Act.

13

respect to checking accounts.

14

what the Board has d>ne by saying that, that savings

15

accounts that are in practice paid on demand are within

16

the scope of the Act.

17

So, we don’t object to what the Board has done

He don’t object to what

Now,

the Board has done with
What we object to was

that Is what Congress overturned.

And

18

they overturned tha ; in a very narrow way, intending to

19

exempt industrial Lanks and savings banks, but as far as

20

Congress was concerned, did not have any kind of a

21

transactional account and dil

22
23
24
25

not make commercial loans.

So, they were completely outside the scope of
what Congres was worried about.
QUESTION*

How does — Does a NOW account

really differ significantly from the kind of account you

just referred to?
MF. BFADFIELDs

A $ OH account, yes, very

3

significantly differs because it has a transaction

4

capability.

5

about are really savings accounts in which you need a

6

passbook, essentially a passbook; there's no third-party

7

transaction capability.

8

to go to the institution and withdraw your money.

9

is when you have money.

10

What those accounts that I was talking

You need a passbook,

you have
Then

In the case of a transaction account, when you

11

go to the store or you make a purchase, then you have

12

money when you actually write your check.

13

the thing that Congress — That was the essence of

14

banking that Congress was concerned about.

15

And that's

And, so, those two characteristics,

the

16

ability to create instruments that are money and the

17

ability to make commercial loans, those were the

18

characteristics that we're worried about.

19

legislative history is replete with references to that.

20

QUESTION;

And the

Mr. Bradfield, if your position —

21

if the Board's position with its new definition of NOW

22

accounts is invalid, do I understand that it would then,

23

it would be required that some industrial lean companies

24

go out and purchase, try to purchase FDIC insurance,

25

which for other technical reasons they would not be able

1

to do?
Are we going to have a hiatus in the

2
3

requirements?

4

MS. BBADFIELDs

Justice O'Connor, you make a

5

very excellent point that has been strongly made on the

6

side of the respondents, that the Board's rule somehow

7

upsets basic industry expectations, and I think I'd like

8

to take a minute to refute that, because I think it's

9

just simply not the case.
First, in the case of industrial banks we’ve

10
i

11

made a careful survey and found only 53 industrial

12

banks, 26 of which are in Colorado, which in fact offer

13

NOW accounts and make commercial loans.

14

out oE about 1,200 industrial banks in the country, only

15

that, less than five percent would be covered by the

16

Beard's regulation.

So, those —

\

Of those companies, only a — we don't know

17
18

how aany, but not all of those 53 are owned by

19

companies, so that they might not have to register in

20

any event.

21

QUESTION*

Mr. Bradfield, did these

22

institutions change their routine practice of allowing

23

withdrawals on demand?

24
25

MR. BRADFIELD*

That's very — that's exactly

what I was getting to. Your Honor, that they —

Did they change their —

MR. BRADFIELD*

the traditional activity has been to offer savings

When

Then it wouldn't be like an

ordinary bank anymore.
MR. BRADFIELD*

16

So then it wouldn *t be covered

17

by the Bank Holding Company Act and we wouldn't be

18

worried.

19

about it, and it would be up to — and then it would be

20

up to Congress to change that.

21

It's possible that we ought to be worried

But that is not covered at this time in the

22

Board's regulations.

We’re worried about the

23

combination of NOW accounts, money and commercial loans,

24

which these institutions, these 50-off institutions

25

actually engage in now.

1

There's another class of institutions, which

2

is the privately insured SSLs, and that industry which

3

did very recently and very rapidly like the industrial

4

banks, those institutions have recently gone into NOW

5

accounts and commercial loans.

destroyed by the events in Ohio and Maryland.

from this and no longer oppose the Board's rule.

chartered which, which take -- would like to be able to

take NOW accounts and make full commercial loans.

23

And they had full notice about the Board's

proposed regulations, the very recent development.

They, too, could conform their activities by giving up

MR. DAVIDSOM*

Mr. Davidson

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
I represent a group of petitioners whose

primary concern is with the commercial loan aspect of

the Board's new definition bank in regulation Y.

7

Counsel who will speak after me represents the group of

8

petitioners who is primarily concerned with the demand

9

part of that definition.

10

With respect to the commercial loan aspect of

11

the definition, I wanted to discuss two points with the

12

Court this afternoon.

13

regulation seeks to expand the Bank Holding Company Act

14

beyond the entire area of business that Congress

15

intended to regulate with that statute.

16

And second,

First, that the Board's new

that the Board's new definition of

17

commercial loan is contrary to common usage and to

18

Congressional intent and therfore cannot be justified on

19

the grounds of agency deference or its evasion authority.

20

On the first point,

the statute -- the

21

language of the statute and its legislative history, and

22

I think just as indicated by counsel for the Boarl,

23

shows that the Bank Holding Company Act is a statute

24

designed for the regulation of the business of

25

commercial banking.

It does so by authorizing the Board
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(2C2) 628-9300

1

to regulate companies which own or control subsidiaries

2

that are commercial banks.

3

Sow, commercial banks are institutions which

4

accept deposits which commercial enterprises are

5

eligible to maintain, in other words corporate checking

6

accounts, and which engage in the business of lending

7

those deposits back to businesses in the form of

8

commercial loans.

9

The Beard's briefs to this Court have stressed

10

the importance of both aspects of those defining

11

characteristics of the business of commercial banking.

12

In the Board's original brief, the Board has pointed out

13

that corporate checking accounts typically constitute a

14

very substantial proportion of the total demand aspect

15

of demand deposits of a commercial bank.

16

And in the Board's reply brief, the Board

17

argues that the foremost obligation of a commercial bank

18

is to supply the credit needs of business enterprises in

19

its community.

20

Now there are, and there always have been,

21

other kinds of providers of financial services which are

22

not engaged in the business of commecial banking as that

23

term has indicated.

24

institutions that are more consumer oriented,

25

engaged in the business of providing financial services

Prominent among them are

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

which are

1

to individuals, including the service of consumer

2

lending.
Now, one key example is the whole category of

3
4

industrial hanks, and as the Court brief itself notes,

5

industrial banks historically are consumer-oriented

6

institutions which serve industrial workers and similar

7

customers who can’t obtain credit from commercial banks.
And there still is a need for such commercial

8
9

banks today, and that’s precisely -- such consumer banks

10

today — and that is precisely why the Comptroller found

11

that the Dimension proposal -- and respondent mentioned

12

Financial Corporation here before the Court -- to open

13

consumer-oriented national banks not engaged in the

14

business of commercial banking was warranted by the

15

needs of the local communities where Dimersion seeks to

16

operate.

17

In light of some of the comments which we have

18

heard this afternoon, I think it is important to point

19

out that these consumer banks , and for fiat matter their

20

affiliates, are regulated to insure their safety and

21

soundness; some of them by the states, some of them,

22

like the proposed Dimension banks, by federal agencies

23

like the\Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal

24

Deposit Insurance Corporation .

25

And there is no evidence that the existence of

And I might note that the same arguments which

14
15

the Board makes here, in its briefs and in oral

16

argument, are the same arguments it has been making to

17

Congress for the last few years, and Congress itself has

18

not perceived the need for any particular emergency here

MR. DAVIDSON;

I think that the important

2

point to think about in terms of the commercial loan

3

language that Congress put into the statute with the

4

1970 amendment is that the commercial loan language, at

5

that time the term commercial loan, is a phrase of

6

common usage.

7

the banking industry.

8
9

It has a commonly understood meaning in

And at that time, in 1970 when Congress put
that phrase into the statute, and for that matter to

10

this day, the term commercial loan, as a matter of

11

common usage, excludes money market and inter-bank

12

transactions which financial institutions, including

13

banks, use for day-to-day asset, liability or liquidity

14

management.

15

It’s a fact that money market and inter-bank

16

transactions are distinct from what people commonly

17

understand by the term commercial loan, and indeed have

18

different characteristics from commercial loans is

19

something that has been demonstrated in a long string of

20

Board decisions —

21

22
23

QUESTION;

Well, how about some of these other

items that are incluiai in the definition?
MR. DAVIDSON;

The only — the things that the

24

Board has included in the definition of commercial loan

25

which we are challenging is the money market and
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., U.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

inter-bank transactions; commercial paper, banker’s

acceptances, broker car loans, purchase and sale of

federal funds, and so forth.

Those are instruments which banks use for

day-to-day liquidity purposes and are not within the

commonly understood of the meaning of the term

8

itself concluded over a course of many years in looking

9

at those specific transactions and concluding that they

were not within the meaning of the term commercial loan

to support their proposition which they

It's interesting, that quotation appears in a

8

chapter in the book on bank lending, which begins with a

9

— the chapter begins with actually the book drawing a

10

sharp distinction between loans, bank loans, and other

11

kinds of transactions that banks engage in for

12

day-to-day liquidity purposes.

13

It's a separate chapter of that book which

14

discusses those kinds of transactions and how they are

15

different, and enumerates the instruments that banks use

16

for day-to-day liquidity purposes as including federal

17

funds, commercial paper, banker's acceptances and

18

negotiable CDs issued by other banks.

19

As this book, as this text points out and as

20

the prior decisions of even the Board and its staff has

21

pointed out, these kinds of transactions basically do

22

not involve the same kind of borrower-lender

23

relationship.

you can see why the term of these particular, why the

1

Has the second bank made a commercial loan, in your view?
HR. DAVIDSON*

2

No, I don't believe so.

I

3

don't believe that that would be the situation of making

4

a commercial loan unless one could indicate that there

5

would be some transfer of funds from the second bank to

6

the original borrower.
In that case, which

7

I suppose could happen in

8

seme situation where the loan would be refinanced or

9

there would be some new relationship that would involve

10

some face-to-face dealings and a negotiation of terms of

11

the new loan assumption, you might be able to say that

12

there was enough face-to-face relationship there to say

13

that there was a making.

14

But,

15

For those reasons and for the reasons, for the

apart from that, I would sugeest no.

16

reasons stated in our brief, we believe that the Board

17

has exceeded the language of the statute and Congress'

18

basic intent, net only with the commercial loan

19

amendment in particular but with the whole scope and

20

what it seeks to regulate under the Bank Holding Company

21

Act.

22

And for those reasons, we believe that no

23

amount of agency deference or deference to the agency's

24

evasion authority can justify the Board in doing

25

something which is to expand its jurisdiction in a

contrary to specific limitations on that jurisdiction

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Courts
The issue that I wish to address is the

12

validity of the Board's attempt in this case to expand

13

the Bank Holding Company Act jurisdiction to cover

14

industrial banks by the means of redefining a statutory

term relating to so-called demand deposits.

Industrial bank is the name that is given to a

variety of small financial instittutions chartered under

state law principally to provide installment credit to

19

consumers and to small businesses.

20

According to data recently submitted to

21

Congress by the Federal Reserve, industrials currently

22

operate in about 20 states; there are about 1,200 of

23

them in the country in existence; and their total

24

deposits are only about five billion dollars.

25

Industrials typically offer two types of

assumption that because of the cloud of uncertainty cast

over this portion of their activities by the Board's

attempts to regulate industrials over the last few

years, that there are many industrials who are waiting

to see what the outcome of this litigation is on this

issue.

17

The American Financial Services Association

18

and the other petitioners that I represent have

19

challenged the Eoard's efforts to bring industrials

20

under Bank Holding Company jurisdiction not only because

21

of their conviction that industrials were never intended

22

by Congress to be covered under that Act because they

23

are not by any stretch of the imagination commercial

24

banks, but also because the Board's new treatment of

25

industrials confronts corporate owners of these

Board's earlier treatment of industrials, because I

8

think the defect in their present position is clearly

9

revealed by a reference to the history of the Board's

10

11

attempts in the past to cover industrials.
As Mr. Bradfield said, in 1956 the sole test

12

of bankness under the Bank Holding Company Set was

13

whether sn institution held a charter as a national bank

14

or a stats bank.

15

state-chartered industrial loan cimpany would be

16

included under the definition of hank if it, and now I

17

quote, "accepts deposits subject to check or otherwise

18

accepts funds from the public

19

practice repaid on demand, as ar-. demand or savings

20

deposits held by commercial banks."

In 1963, however, the- fed rule that a

that are in actual

21

The actual practice language was a reference

22

to the fact that savings accounts, both in industrials

23

and in commercial banks, have historically been subject

24

to a reserved right in the institution to require some

25

period of notice before withdrawal, a right that is

almost never exercised even though its reservation is

2

uniformly compelled by state and federal law.
In 1965 the Board reaffirmed its position,

3
4

holding that industrials had offered investment

5

certificates that were repaid in practice on demand were

6

subject to the Bank Holding Company Act, and again there

7

was no attempt to distinguish industrials on the basis

8

of whether they offered checking accounts.
Industrials took their case to Congress, and

in 1966 Congress responded by repudiating the Board's

attempt to extend its jurisdiction over this type of

financial institution.

difference between prior notice accounts as to which the

14

right of notice was ceguired but almost never exercised

15

and true demand deposits, where no such right existed at

16

all.

17

Congress fully recognized the

And Congress amended the Bank Holding Company

18

Act definition to include as banks only those

19

institutions offering deposits that were withdrawable on

20

demand as a matter of legal right.

21

The Board argued at

that time for a definition

22

that used the terminology demand deposit, but Congress

23

rejected that and used the, the very technical, rather

24

stilted language deposits that the depositor has a legal

25

right to withdraw on demand, and used that language for

Contrary to Hr. Bradfield’s suggestion, the

5

Board’s definition that is in the present regulation

6

would include passbook savings accounts, as Justice’

7

O'Connor asked if it would, if the withdrawal from the

8

savings account was made by check.

9

A NOW account is really no more than an

10

interest-bearing savings account from which withdrawals

11

may be made by a variety of methods, either by

12

presentation of a passbook or a withdrawal slip or by a

13

negotiable instrument.

distinguishable from a true demand deposit in several

distinct and important respects.

The Board now tries to reassert its

2
3

jurisdiction over industrials by making two arguments.

4

First, they argue that depositors do in fact have legal

5

right to withdraw on demand until the institution

6

actually exercises its right to acquire prior notice of

7

withdra wal.

/

And second, they argue that the legal right to

8'
9

withdraw on demand language really doesn’t mean what it

10

says, but it was intended to apply to checking accounts.
I don’t think there’s any merit in either one

11
12

of those arguments.

The first argument simply amounts

13

to playing with words and ignores the plain meaning of

14

the statute.

15

the phraseology legal right to withdraw on demand was to

16

exclude prior notice accounts, fully recognizing that

17

the prior notice is almost never exercised.

What Congress clearly meant to do by us^ng

18

The Board’s argument flies in the face of the

19

legislative history, and it would make nonsense of what

20

Congress intended to do in 1966.
The argument also flies in the face of the

21

22

Board’s own longstanding interpretation of the

23

distinction between demand deposits and savings

24

deposits.

25

reserved right of notice is almost never exercised with

The Eoard has been aware for decades that the

respect to interest-bearing savings accounts that are,

2

in practice, withdrawn on demand.

3

Yet, that distinction, as slim as it may

4

appear, has always sufficed in Board regulations --

5

indeed, it suffices today — to distinguish such

6

accounts from demand deposits on which a payment of

7

interest is prohibited.

8
9

The second argument, that the language should
be read to mean checking accounts rather than what it

10

says, is simply wishful thinking.

11

12

the means by which deposits could be withdrawn.

have been very easy for it to do so by defining that leg

since almost 20 years ago. Congress tried to make it

And if the Board now believes that industrials

have so changed in the nature of the services that they

offer, a proposition that we vigorously dispute, it

should be required to make that case to Congress and it

BR. BRADFIELD*

Thank you, Br. Chief Justice.

13

I would like to start by pointing out that the

14

basic approach that Congress has had to this whole

15

question of tank holding company activities is that the

16

combination of ownership by industrial and commercial

17

firms of banks is just too frought with the potential

18

for abuse to be permitted.
Tne alternative of permitting such

19

20

combinations but subjecting them to careful regulations

21

was rejected, was considered and it was rejected by the

22

Congress.

So, rather than the Board extending its

1

2

jurisdiction, the Board is simply implementing what

3

Congress already intended in

4

1956 and 1966 and in 1970.

If you take that approach and then you look at

5

the respondents' representations that they are just

6

small consumer organizations, then you have to ask

7

yourself the question whether the industrial hanks and

8

Dimension are small consumer organizations, and you have

9

to ask yourself the question that they are — they may

10

be today, but will they be tomorrow?

If they have this

11

authority to combine HOW accounts and commercial loans,

12

full commercial loans, won't they be able to use this

13

authority in a way that's precisely the way that

14

Congress said it shouldn't be used.
NOW accounts, I should remind you, are a

15

ery

16

major portion of our money supply.

There's over 171

17

billion in NOW accounts;; larger than currency in

18

circulation, and almost as large, 65 percent of the

19

amount of demand deposits.

20

that's what Congress wanted to regulate.

NOW accounts are money, and

I'd like to also point out that the charge has

I don’t think that the

Justice Stevens was exactly correct that if a,

11

a commercial bank buys a loan from another commercial

12

bank it has made a commercial loan, and if there’s a

13

problem with that loan it is responsible and has to

14

engage in direct face-to-face negotiations with the

other party in order to straighten things out.

Similarly, broker car loans, a direct face-to-face

I would finally point cut that the notice

notice requirement that they propose would. Is just

sufficient to take an instrument, the NOW account, from

it's enough -- if that were true, any bank holding

company, the largest bank holding company could simply
