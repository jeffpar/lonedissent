ORAL ARGUMENT OF CABANNE HOWARD, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

6
7

MR. HOWARD:

10

11

The issue in this case is whether the State of
Maine, consistent with the Commerce Clause, may prohibit the
importation of live baitfish for the purpose of protecting
its environment.

12
13
14
15
16
17

The case is here on the State's appeal from a decision
of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
which declared the state statute unconstitutional for failing
to survive the strict scrutiny test required by this Court
in Hughes versus Oklahoma.

20
21

22
23
24
25

This Court subsequently postponed

jurisdiction over the appeal until this hearing.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

Mr. Howard, I think you may

After a brief summary of the relevant facts and a
statement of why this Court has jurisdiction, I would like
to explain why the Court of Appeals misapplied the proper
standard for appellate review of factual findings in district
court set forth in Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, and why the Court also subjected the Maine statute
to an unnecessarily strict standard of constitutional
scrutiny.

The State of Maine has a small and unique freshwater

fishery.

3

alike.

4

legislature passed a statute which is at issue in this case

5

to protect the fishery against the importation of diseased

6

fish.

7

It is available to all residents and non-residents
To protect that fishery, in 1959 the State's

In 1981, Congress passed the Lacey Act Amendment

8

of that year, making it a federal crime to engage in inter­

9

state commerce in violation of statutes such as Maine's.

10

In February of 1983, the Defendant in this case was

11

indicted for importing and 158,000 baitfish, some of which

12

contained various diseases about, which the state was con­

13

cerned.

14

grounds of the unconstitutionality of the underlying state

15

statute.

16

Title 28 United States Code, Section 2403(b) in order to

17

defend its statute.

18

The Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the

The state was permitted to intervene pursuant to

An evidentiary hearing was held before a United

19

States magistrate and the state and federal government

20

introduced substantial expert testimony showing that its

21

statute satisfied both prongs of the Hughes versus Oklahoma

22

test, those being that the statute was needed to protect the

23

state against various parasites and exotic species which could

24

come in through a shipment of live bait, and, secondly, that

25

there was no alternative to an absolute ban on the importation.
4

1

The district court and — The magistrate and subse­

2

quently the district court agreed with the state and sustained

3

the statute, but the Court of Appeals, asserting its freedom

4

to re-evaluate the evidence completely, reversed.

5

6

The state then appealed to this Court, although the
United States government did not.

7

The state believes that this case is covered by the

8

plain language 28 United State Code, Section 1254(2) which

9

gives this Court jurisdiction, and I am quoting, "by appeal

10

by a party relying on a state statute held by a court of appeals

11

to be invalid."

12

On the merits, on the question of the adequacy of

13

the evidence to support the district court's finding, the state

14

believes that with regard to the -- that the principle error

15

created by the Court of Appeals in this case was a decision

16

in effect to retry the case.

17

overwhelming that the statute met both prongs of the Hughes

18

test.

19

The state's evidence here was

With regard to the legitimate purpose behind the

20

statute, the state fish pathologist and two other expert —

21

academic experts testified that the statute was needed to guard

22

against both three specific parasites which could establish

23

themselves in Maine's sport fish such as trout, bass, and salmon,

24

and also that the statute was needed to protect against the

25

introduction of exotic species such as, for example, the common

carp, which might successfully compete with indigenous species

2

for habitat.

3

The same witnesses, as well as the Defendant's own

4

expert, testified as to the second prong of the Hughes test;

5

that the scientific community has not established a testing

6

program of any kind for baitfish.

7

since there is no possibility of inspecting fish or testing

8

fish —

10

QUESTION:

And, since that is the case,

General Howard, can I interrupt you for

just a second?

11

MR. HOWARD:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.
As I understand your brief, you take the

13

position that the Court of Appeals acted as a trial de novo

14

in effect and you are giving your version of the evidence.

15

You are not giving us the findings that you think the Court

16

of Appeals ignored.

17

lying evidence ourselves or can we content ourselves to look

18

at the district court's findings?

court found to be the facts in the case.

court's findings if you read them, the findings of — It refers

as a fact certain things, these things.

2

QUESTION:

In your submission, do we need to go beyond

3

the district court's written opinion to find out what the facts

4

are?

5

MR. HOWARD:

Well, we believe that this Court should

6

act in the same way as the Court of Appeals should have acted,

7

which is to apply the clear erroneous test to the record and

8

if you find that there is substantial evidence in the record

9

to support the findings of the district court, you should rever

MR. HOWARD:

QUESTION:

9

There were differences in the opinion

There were — If I can summarize -But, nevertheless, the court believed

judgment of another.

10

MR. HOWARD:

Yes, that is right.

The thrust of the

11

Defendant's expert testimony which the Defendant's counsel

12

will summarize also was that the diseases and parasites that

13

the state was concerned about were really not that serious,

14

therefore, there was no need for —

15

QUESTION:

Did the findings of the district court

16

necessarily involve passing on the credibility of these

17

experts?

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

MR. HOWARD:

Yes, sir, they certainly did, and we

would suggest that is a very important part of this case.
QUESTION:

That is what puzzles me because one of

the things he said was that the lack of agreement is not itself
the ground for taking one position or the other.

He, in effect,

seemed to say that there is disagreement among experts and
you need more than that in order to come to the correct
conclusion.

Doesn't he say the experts disagree on the issue?
8

1

2

MR. HOWARD:

the question of the seriousness of a threat.

3
4

The-experts were in disagreement on

QUESTION:

Correct.

And, does he resolve that

disagreement?

5

MR. HOWARD:

He says that it is not — The Commerce

6

Clause should not be read to require the state to take the

7

risk that something will happen to the state.

8
9

QUESTION:

Correct.

So, he is saying that no matter

which one is right the fact that there is disagreement is enough

10

to support the reasonableness of the state — That is quite

11

different from saying that he picked one set of experts over

12

the other.

13
14

MR. HOWARD:

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Either way it is

satisfactory for us.

15
16

Well, that is true.

QUESTION:

Well, I understand, but it is a different

argument.
(Laughter)
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Howard, this line of questioning

gets to a question I have had frankly and that is what does
the Hughes case require, what is the test laid down in Hughes?
One aspect of it, as I understand here, is that the state has
the burden of establishing that no non-discriminatory
alternative is available.

The district court, as I understand

it, said that Hughes does not preclude the state from acting
where the evidence on the effectiveness of such alternatives
9

1

is in doubt and where the potential disruptive impact is great.
Now, I read the First Circuit's opinion as

2
3

possibly disagreeing with that as a legal standard under Hughes.

4

And, if that is the case, then you have a legal issue here

5

to deal with before you have to grapple with the underlying

6

facts.

7

MR. HOWARD:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Well —
In other words, maybe the district court

read the standard under Hughes to generously according to the
First Circuit.

11

Is that a possibility?

MR. HOWARD:

We think that we have satisfied the

12

Hughes test even giving it the strictest reading that the First

13

Circuit's opinion could be read to give it.

14

relying on any —

15

QUESTION:

So, we are not

Well, do you think the district court's

16

articulation of this standard, that if the evidence is in doubt,

17

then that is enough for the state?

18

correct?

19

MR. HOWARD:

20

QUESTION:

21

22

Do you think that is

Well, I think that makes sense.
Well, it may make sense.

Do you think

it is correct under Hughes?
MR. HOWARD:

Well, I think Hughes could be read to

23

include such a statement, where there is such a test, where

24

there is doubt in the scientific community.

25

As I am going to say in a minute, of course, we —
10
a

miirocAv 'nir'3AOT:!!k.!,crA.Ui3*\"V

invr*

1

think — A further argument in this case can be made that the

2

standard should be not as strict as the Hughes test in the

3

first place.

4

But, that argument aside, I think —

QUESTION:

I think it is important to know whether ther e

5

is some framework here for a disagreement on the legal standard

6

between the district court and the First Circuit.

7

MR. HOWARD:

I didn't get the impression from reading

8

the district court's opinion that the district court — rather

9

reading the Court of Appeals' opinion that it was disagreeing

10

with what the district court had said.

11

Appeals agreed that the district court was applying the strict

12

scrutiny test and in applying the test it is fair enough to

13

say that if there is doubt among the scientific community as

14

to what the status of science is, that that ought to be enough

15

to give the state a legitimate purpose in legislating against

16

uncertainties.

17

at all.

18

I think the Court of

So, I don't see a difference between the two

As I was saying a second ago, the prohibition —

19

the needs of this prohibition in this case is required because

20

of the absolute testing procedure.

21

district court found was that there is no testing procedure.

22

So, in short, the state feels that it satisfied the Hughes

23

test in this case no matter how strictly one wants to state

24

it.

25

evidence in this record.

The evidence that the

And, in fact, the Hughes test can't be satisfied on the
It probably is a test that nobody

% a

1

can satisfy.

2

Now, beyond this, the state also suggests that the

3

strict scrutiny test of Hughes may not be appropriate to apply

4

in this case for the reason that the Congress enacted the Lacey
*

5

Act Amendments in 1981 which encouraged the states to pass

6

statutes of this kind.

7

And, if the courts were to continue to apply the

8

strict scrutiny test to statutes like this, that would frustrate

9

the will of Congress in passing the Lacey Act Amendments.

10
11
12
13

In short, there is a need to harmonize the policy of Congress
in encouraging statutes like this with, of course, the policy
of the Commerce Clause to prevent the economic vulcanization
of the United States.

14
15
16
17
18

In our brief, we have suggested that there is a way
in which the Court could fashion a lower degree of scrutiny.
We are not arguing that there should be no scrutiny at all,
of course, but we do argue that there should be a lesser degree
of scrutiny.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

For example, on the question of legitimate purpose,
we think that the proper way under the Lacey Act to approach
a case like this would be to presume that the state statute,
that the state legislature has acted for the legitimate purpose
that it says and put the burden on the Defendant to come in
with some evidence that there is some illegitimate purpose
going on.
12

And, similarly, on the question of whether there

1

2

is an adequate alternative, the state should be given a little

3

bit more leeway than being required to adopt any hypothetical

4

alternative.that the Court of Appeals might be able to think

5

up.
In conclusion, the state believes that the Commerce

6
7

Clause should not require it to take the risk that the

8

indiscriminate importation of baitfish would not be harmful

9

to its environment.

10
11

If there are no further questions, Mr. Chief Justice,
I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERROLD J. GANZFRIED, ESQ.

14

IN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLANT

15
16

Mr. Ganzfried?

MR. GANSFRIED:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

17

I would like to address some of the questions that

18

came up during the state's presentation and that is that there

19

is no difference of opinion in the record on the fact of whether

20

there were may tests, inspections, certification, or sampling

21

procedures presently available to test these fish for the

22

parasites and exotic diseases in any way other than a total

23

exclusion.

24
25

The district court found that the fact remains that
there is no testing technique.

The Court of Appeals did not

13
Ik il 1“^

II .k ■■ r*

1

find that finding to be clearly erroneous and, in fact,

2

Appellee Taylor does not contest to the contrary.

3
4

His brief in this Court on page 25 says simply that
there are procedures that could be developed.

5

So, we submit that what one might ordinarily expect

6

would be a less restrictive form of regulation in this area,

7

mainly an inspection and testing procedure is on the facts

8

that Maine has proven in this case, simply not available.

9

QUESTION:

Can you buy baitfish in Maine?

10

MR. GANSFRIED:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GANSFRIED:

13

Warm water bait?
I may not have the technology correct,

but if it is from Maine, if it is not imported into Maine —

14
15

You can buy live bait in Maine.

QUESTION:

Yes.

Maine people do sell bait for the

purpose — for the same purpose that these baitfish were —

I believe that there is a form of

recall —

QUESTION:

MR. GANSFRIED:

How do they know that —

has a different name.

QUESTION:

How do they know that the baitfish

produced in Maine are without bacterial injury?

6

be some testing procedures then.

7

MR. GANSFRIED:

There must

Yes, there are some procedures for

8

testing.

9

in order to test a fish you have to kill the fish.

10
11

The difficulties with them are, number one, that
Once you

kill the fish, it is not live bait.
QUESTION:

If they can assure themselves that

12

the baitfish produced in Maine posed no danger, why can't they

13

assure themselves by visiting some out-of-state hatchery that

14

the right procedures are —

15

MR. GANSFRIED:

The record indicates, and it is

16

uncontested on this point, that the parasites, diseases, and

17

predators that were discussed in this case are not native to

18

the State of Maine and have not been previously found in the

19

State of Maine.

20

QUESTION:

21

if they can't test?

22

How do they know that they haven't been

MR. GANSFRIED:

To the best ability that they have

23

with the tests — They have no test that they can perform

24

without killing the fish and, therefore, rendering no longer

25

live baitfish.

QUESTION:

1

That is true of all fish.

I mean, if

2

you were importing trout or salmon or whatever, you just take

3

a sample and you kill the ones in the sample, isn't that right?

4

MR. GANSFRIED:

Yes.

The difference is, and the

5

testimony in the record reflects this, is that for trout and

6

salmon, testing, sampling, and certification procedures have

7

been developed and they are regarded as reliable.

8

procedures have been developed for live baitfish and to the

9

extent that there are any testing procedures at all, they are

No such

10

not considered reliable and they often produce false negatives,

11

so even — As Mr. Walker, the state expert, the first witness

12

in the case, testified, he examined the fish in this batch

13

of 158,000 Mr. Taylor was bringing in and based on the tests

14

available to him, he said even the fish he killed and

15

examined he could not certify that they were free of these

16

diseases and parasites.

17
18

QUESTION:

So, you say that because these parasites

have never been found in Maine as far as you know, that Maine

19

is just lucky enough not to be cursed with those, but they

20

know that other states, baitfish from other states are.

21

MR. GANSFRIED:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

That is correct.

And, you never can tell when they are

or are not.
MR. GANSFRIED:

You can sometimes tell when they

are, but you can never tell with any reliability that they
16

1

are not.

2

QUESTION:

May I ask one question about the absence

3

of testing procedures which seems to suggest kind of ends the

4

case.

5

Wasn't the dispute in the testimony over the question

6

whether the problem was sufficiently serious to justify the

7

expenditure and so forth to develop testing procedures?

8

experts said, well, this doesn't amount to anything anyway,

9

so that is why we don't have tests.

10

Some

That is what the conflict

was.

11

MR. GANSFRIED:

That is right.

And, the portion

12

of the district court's opinion to which I referred to before

13

discussing the disagreement, the district court does indicate

14

that he is speaking about a disagreement only with respect to

15

the question of the legitimacy of a state interest and not as

16

to whether there is a less restrictive alternative and found

17

that the Defendant's expert agreed with prosecution that there

18

is not testing/inspection/certification procedure.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

The district court's comment to that disagreement
was limited to the legitimacy of the purpose.

The Court of

Appeals did not find to the contrary on the purpose.

The

district court upheld the purpose, the Court of Appeals did
not find that the state's purpose was not a legitimate state
purpose.
QUESTION:

Do you take the view that if there is
17

1

disagreement among experts on whether there is a serious problem

2

or not that that is a sufficient basis for sustaining the

3

statute without the judge finding that one group of experts

4

was right as opposed to the others?

5

MR. GANSFRIED:

We think that the question of whether

6

the threat to the state is a sufficiently serious one is

7

essentially a legislative determination and that the —

8
9

QUESTION:

So, your answer is if they can get one

expert that says it is serious, that is enough to justify the

10

statute even though the judge says I don't know whether to believ

11

him or not.

12

That is your position?
MR. GANSFRIED:

Our position is essentially — The

13

orderly way to proceed is for Mr. Taylor, if he develops a test,

14

which he hasn't done yet, to present that, to present his experts

15

to present his possibilities as to inspection and certification

16

procedures to the state legislature.

17

It basically is our feeling that under Hughes versus

18

Oklahoma, there should be sufficient elbow-room for a state

19

to implement prophylactic measures when the effect on the state's

20

ecology would be very serious and there is substantial

21

scientific basis for the state's concern.

22

On the question of the state of the record in this

23

case, I would point out that the Defendant's expert himself

24

contradicted himself on the point.

3
4

We have to look at the underlying evidence

We can't just read the district court's opinion, right?
MR. GANSFRIED:

5

No.

I think the findings the

6

district court sustaining the legitimacy of the state purpose

7

and according proper deference to the state legislature, not

8

substituting the court's judgment for the legislative judgment,

9

and the findings of fact by the district court, which were not

10

found to be clearly erroneous by the Court of Appeals, but were

11

simply disregarded by the court which, as it said, read the

12

record and "drew its own conclusions."

13

We think that where the Court of Appeals went wrong

14

was in substituting its finding of fact for those of the

15

district court and in substituting its judgment for the state

16

legislature.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Gansfried, do you think there is

18

any tension or disagreement between the district court and the

19

Court of Appeals on the Hughes standard?

20

MR. GANSFRIED:

They articulate the Hughes standard

21

the same way, but in terms of the application of that standard

22

to the particular case —

23
24
25

QUESTION:

I mean, the Court of Appeals seemed to

apply a more strict standard under Hughes.
MR. GANSFRIED:

The Court of Appeals seemed to
19

1

assume it was the arbiter of both facts and state interest.

2

And, under this Court's decision, it is neither.

3
4

I have addressed the difficulties with the Court
of Appeals' opinion.

5

Let me get back to one important point that is a

6

factual one and that is the uniqueness of Maine's situation.

7

They do prohibit the importation of live baitfish,

8

but if I could draw an anlogy to this Court's decision in

9

Philadelphia versus New Jersey, the situation Maine was in here

10

is similar to what New Jersey would have been in had there been

11

no domestic solid waste in New Jersey.

12

is attempting to keep out and protect its environment from that

13

which was not there before.

14

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

16

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

18

20

Mr. Eggert?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. PAUL EGGERT, ESQ.

17

19

Here, the State of Maine

MR. EGGERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Taylor in the court below has attacked the

21

constitutionality of the state statute which forbids the

22

importation of baitfish.

23

circumstance of being in the midst of a federal criminal

24

prosecution and attacking a state statute.

25

He has done that in a fairly unique

As background for that particular challenge, Mr.
20

1

Taylor has been in the bait business for approximately 17 years.

2

He has raised in the State of Maine baitfish and mainly golden

3

shiners during that period of time.
They are, indeed, the same type of species of golden

4
5

shiners that he was attempting to import in this particular

6

situation.

7

The reason Mr. Taylor is importing golden shiners

8

from other states is due to the reality of aquaculture in Maine.

9

Maine has a harsh winter, a short warm season during which fish

10

may be raised and harvested and the fish selling cycle is just

11

the opposite of that.

12

with live bait, but they do not do so.

13

winter, ice fish with live bait, and that is the peak season

14

for Mr. Taylor.

15

Maine fishermen can fish year around
Mainly, they fish in

It is very difficult for Mr. Taylor to raise golden

16

shiners and keep them over the winter to supply the demand of

17

his customers, and, therefore, in order to remain in business

18

and to grow in his business as the demand of the marketplace

19

dictates, he has been forced to go outside the state during

20

winter months to bring back in golden shiners.

21

The initial question that is before this Court as

22

I understand it is a matter of jurisdiction which has been

23

reserved to this hearing.

24
25

Our position on jurisdiction is that Section 1254(2)
is not as clear cut as the state would have us believe, but,
21

1

in fact, that particular statute does not apply to criminal

2

cases, which this is.

3

statute applies only to civil cases.

4

legislative history of that statute and in the very language

5

of the statute itself.

6

hear the merits of this particular case, but that we would

7

contend that the Court must treat this as a petition for Writ

8

of Certiorari and we would further contend that this question

9

is not important enough for the Court of grant that, petition.

10

It is a criminal appeal.

And, that that

That is clear in the

That does not mean that this Court cannot

All parties in this particular case, I think, agree

11

that this statute that we are talking about is discriminatory.

12

It is a flat prohibition against the importation of baitfish.

13

It stops it at the border.

14

What is being prohibited is something that the state

15

allows all the time to go on within its borders.

16

are a common baitfish within the State of Maine and outside

17

the State of Maine.

18

Golden shiners

Once this discriminatory effect of the statute has

19

been admitted by all parties, the constitutional law which —

20

the body of constitutional law which has surrounded the analysis

21

of the statute indicates that the courts must look at the statute

22

and the proposed justification for the statute with strict scruti:hy

23

We would contend that the district court, through the magistrate'

24
25

findings, and also the district court's findings, gave lip
service to that strict scrutiny standard and said that they
22

1

were applying the strict scrutiny standard and, in effect, were

2

merely adopting the opinions of the state's experts because

3

they really didn't have any basis for distinguishing between

4

or finding one expert's opinion to be more correct than the

5

others.

They fell back to the position that the state has

6

proposed these problems as their legitimate purpose.

7

Defendants contest that, but we are not really sure, therefore,

8

we will accept the state at face value and allow the statute

9

to stand.

10
11

The

We contend that the Court must do more than that,
that the Court must not just make findings perhaps on a pre­

12

ponderance of the evidence standard or maybe even a lesser

13

standard in this particular case, as what the court did,

14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

but they must make those findings and then look and scrutinize
those findings in the context of everything else that was
presented in the hearing.
I think this Court does, indeed, have to go back
to the transcript to look at the evidence that was presented.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Eggert, in the brief you

suggest that under a Commerce Clause analysis that clear
and convincing evidence is the standard to be applied.

Now,

you are not arguing that to us, are you?
MR. EGGERT:

No, I am not, Your Honor.

I think

I may have been analogizing that when that is the standard
and the lower court — When a clear and convincing standard
23

1

is evidenced as the standard, and the lower court has

2

obviously misapplied that standard, that the Appellate Court

3

then has to look at the record, the factual record, and make

4

a determination for itself from that record whether or not

5

the lower court is correct.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. EGGERT:

Well, this is just a preponderance —
As it pertains, I believe, to the

8

initial findings of fact, but that is not sufficient that

9

the findings of fact agree with the state's position.

The

10

Court must go further than that and apply those facts to

11

the statute and that is where the strict scrutiny comes in.

12

It is not enough that the Court say, yes, we agree, for

13

instance, that there is a parasite which could be introduced

14

into the State of Maine through importation of baitfish.

15

It goes further than that to find out if that is a sufficient

16

reason for blocking commerce at Maine's border.

17

In two of those particular instances --

18

QUESTION:

I am not sure I understand your idea

19

of strict scrutiny here which is the kind of thing you might

20

apply under an equal protection analysis if there were

21

discrimination on the basis of race.

22

there, do we?

23

Hughes versus Oklahoma that we have to apply, isn't that

24

right?

25

We don't have that

We just have the requirements set forth in

MR. EGGERT:

Well, the Hughes versus Oklahoma indicated
24

!

1

that the strict scrutiny standard is what is being applied

2

and what has to be applied.

3

that used in equal protection cases.

4

place in wfcich that standard is fully explicated.

5

That language is identical to
I know of no other

I would suggest to the Court that, yes, indeed,

6

it is the same standard and that the courts have to go beyond

7

just what is presented to it by way of factual basis.

8

particular case is justification for the statute and gives

9

serious consideration and hard consideration as to whether

10

or not that is sufficient to allow a state to block inter­

11

state commerce.

12

This

In this particular case factually, we have one

13

of the parasites, capillaria, being proposed and that was

14

found in this particular shipment, as I understand it.

15

is proposed as a justification for blocking interstate

16

commerce, and yet the state's expert has agreed he has found

17

capillaria within the state.

18

QUESTION:

That

Well, under — in applying the Hughes

19

test, do you think the Court of Appeals is free to just

20

speculate on other possible alternatives or does the Court

21

of Appeals have to consider and rely on the evidence as

22

determined by the district court?

23

MR. EGGERT:

No, I don't think it can speculate

24

and go totally outside the record, but it certainly can look

25

to other sources in the sense that the First Circuit Court
25
Al nPRQOM RFPnPTINGrOMPANY. INC.

1

of Appeals did.

2

structure to see whether or not Maine's avowed purpose with

3

this statute was at all consistent with what they do with

4

other fish.

5

It went to Maine's statutory and regulatory

The state's contention is that somehow baitfish

6

are entirely different from trout and salmon which they would

7

like to encourage in the State of Maine and that is true

8

because they are different species.

9

bit of prejudice, I believe, involved in that particular

10

conception and that is that somehow the baitfish dealers

11

in Arkansas are not as careful and good as the trout raisers

12

in Maryland, let's say, without much justification for that.

13

The state's experts --

14

QUESTION:

However, there is a

Mr. Eggert, supposing that we were dealing

15

with district court findings of just rather plain, ordinary

16

facts as to whether there were or were not an adequate test

17

for this parasite.

18

Now, if the district court finds those facts of

19

particular weight and the appeal is taken to the Court of

20

Appeals, does the Court of Appeals review those under a clearly

21

erroneous standard as it would other findings of fact?

22

MR. EGGERT:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. EGGERT:

25

No, I don't believe they do.
Why not?
Because it is a mixed question of

law and fact.

The hypothesis I gave you was the kind

of factual questions that are classical, factual questions

4

the clearly erroneous test.

5

MR. EGGERT:

6

QUESTION:

7

10

MR. EGGERT:

I agree.
Why isn't the Court of Appeals bound

They are bound by the clearly erroneous

test when they look at the facts, but they are not bound
when they then apply the legal standard to that.

11
12

That doesn't set you free from

by the clearly erroneous test here?

8

You are always going to

QUESTION:

Well, no, I don't think anyone would

think they were.

13

MR. EGGERT:

Okay.

But, then, when they go and

14

look at the legal standard that the district court applied

15

and determines, which I believe they did determine, that

16

the district court was wrong with that legal standard, then

17

I think that opens to question whether or not the district

18

court was adequately and properly looking at the factual

19

record in making its findings.

20

QUESTION:

Is that the clearly erroneous test or

21

is it something different?

22

statement.

23

MR. EGGERT:

You know, it is a rather vague

I guess it is more of a hybrid.

I

24

think the courts have said that when there are factual findings

25

that don't fit into the legal structure or the proper legal

1

standard, that the courts then are not bound by those factual

2

findings.

3

record and review the facts.

4

That they then have to somehow get back into the

So, if as far as we had to go was to say could

5

the district court, based on the record, determine that there

6

were no alternative means or that there were no other alternati

7

means of testing or that there are no adequate methodscof

8

testing and that was the end of the question, then I think,

9

yes, the district court would be correct.

The Court of Appeals

10

would apply the clearly erroneous standard.

11

not end, in my view, the inquiry that the Court of Appeals

12

has to undertake when it reviews the district court findings.

But, that does

13

I would like to perhaps clear up a problem in the

14

record and that is I do not believe any of the experts said

15

there were no procedures except procedures for testing various

16

fish for these parasite problems.

17

The state's expert himself testified that he tested-

18

the fish in his samples for the three parasite problems and

19

was satisfied that he found two of the three within the

20

shipment.

21

fact, there is a testing procedure.

22

I think that is pretty clear evidence that, in

What is really at issue and what the experts disagree

23

upon is the sampling procedure which is undertaken.

24

with trout and salmon, everybody has agreed that some "X"

25

number of a thousand fish, five out of a thousand fish can
28

Now,

1

be sampled and if those are disease free, then we can pretty

2

safely say that the entire shipment is disease free.

3

have not yet agreed we can do that and say we have sampled

4

five of the thousand baitfish and, therefore, the entire

5

shipment is disease free and the reason that hasn't been

6

done is because these particular problems that the state

7

is talking about do not pose a threat to the total ecological

8

system of the warm-water fish in Maine.

I don't know.
And, your position is it doesn't pose

MR. EGGERT:

a problem in the sense that it will not infect the wild fish
population; that there is no evidence in the record, even
though these parasites have existed in other states all

Right.
The other reason that the state's

Maine's water environment is not unique.

13

In fact,

they come probably from the same place, through the Massachusetts
wholesale dealers, into the State of New Hampshire.

And,

any release of those baitfish in the State of New Hampshire,
at least in the common, shared watershed between New Hampshire
and Maine is going to mean that these problems are going
to exist in Maine, if, in fact, they don't already exist,

Finally, and perhaps by no means least, the district

21

court found that there was no economic protectionism involved

22

in this particular statute despite some direct evidence in

it was better to raised baitfish in Maine and keep Maine's

25

baitfish economic alive and healthy rather than spending

The Circuit Court of Appeals, I think, more correctly

2
3

looked at that and at least indicated that that was a reflection,

4

that there was, indeed, some economic protectionism involved

5

in this particular case and that is the very problem that

6

the Commerce Clause is designed to prevent.
QUESTION:

7

8

bait fishing entirely?

9

MR: EGGERT:

10
11

Do you think Maine could just prevent

QUESTION:

Yes, indeed, they could.
And, keep out baitfish from any other

states?

12

MR. EGGERT:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.
I know they could prevent bait fishing,

14

but do you think could keep -- They could enforce that rule

15

by preventing importation of baitfish?

16

MR. EGGERT:

I would think the state could regulate

17

in such a fashion that they say people in Maine, we will

18

not allow fishing with live bait in the State of Maine.

19

If that is a serious problem, if the state thinks there are

20

serious problems with live bait, then that is an even-handed

21

regulation that they certainly could adopt.

22

I am not sure the could, but —

23
24

QUESTION:

Politically

You don't think the state is required

to go to that length to meet its reasonable alternatives?

No.

I am suggesting that the state

a

ncoc/Mk1 'C*|nD(r'iiE*7Hii^:i('T,

is required to perhaps expend a little bit of effort to

2

regulate and allow baitfish to be imported into the State

3

of Maine under strick controls perhaps, but not be allowed

4

to just flatly prohibit the importation of baitfish.

5

I believe that the State of Maine can, if it wants

6

to, devise a system, a permanent system, a licensed system,

7

an inspection system which would satisfy them and which would

8

satisfy Mr. Taylor and other bait dealers in the State of

9

Maine, indeed, as many other states in the northeast.

10

QUESTION:

Is your client prepared to share its

11

costs — share the cost of sending inspectors all around

12

the country?

13

MR. EGGERT:

If that is what it takes for him to

be able to import baitfish, to have them inspected somewhere^

else, he certainly would.

The place where most of these baitfish come from
in Arkansas, there is, in fact — I am not sure, the Department
of Inland Fisheries research station there that does, in
fact, test sample certified fish to be disease free and they
certainly could do that right there at the source in Arkansas
and the fish could be brought into Maine quickly.

You were concerned, as I recall, about whether
there is a difference in the test that the district court
and the Court of Appeals applied here.

I had a chance to

reread the Court of Appeals' opinion during the other arguments
and I can't see anything in there that indicates that the
Court of Appeals criticized the district court on its applica­
tion of the test.
And, furthermore, the point on which the Court
of Appeals reversed? that is that there was other means that
the state hadn't sought and found to protect tiself, that
a

point is one in which there is no disagreement in the record.

2

There is no evidence at all that there is no test.

3

is unequivocal.

4

The record

The disagreement occurs on the point as to whether

5

there is a risk, whether there is a real risk or not.

6

Defendant's experts on that issue tried to make the point

7

that there was a difficulty on the risk.

The

But, that wasn't the point on which the Court of
Appeals reversed the lower court.

So, it doesn't seem that

10

there is a problem with regard to the application of the

11

test in either case.

12

And, as to the question about the risk, Justice

13

Stevens, I think you were concerned that the district court

14

didn't make findings about that and if I could just direct

15

your attention to a paragraph on page D-7 of the jurisdictional

16

statement.

It is in the middle of the page, the first full

17

paragraph.

I think that is the paragraph where the court

18

is finding that — having cited the testimony above it —

19

the court is coming to the conclusion that given the somewhat

20

unique characteristics associated with the Maine fish population,

21

the substantial uncertainties surrounding the effects and

22

so on shows that there is a risk.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

What sentence do you refer?

I just

read that paragraph as a recitation of what the testimony
was.

is entitled to rely on the uncertainty.

MR. HOWARD:

Right.

But, I think he is finding

that there is a substantial uncertainty.

That is to say

that he is not finding that — He is finding that there is

QUESTION:

Do you know of any other states that

have a similar rule?

19

MR. HOWARD:

No.

And, I think one of the reasons

20

why there isn't is because the State of Maine — and it is

21

in the record and the courts found this below — a unique

22

and fragile fishery here which requires a prohibition of

23
24
25

this kind.

Many other states have regimes where the state

administrative officer, the Fish & Game Commissioner, let's
say, has the power to regulate the importation of fish

MR. HOWARD

I know of no other state that has

a statutory prohibition.

17

QUESTION:

Well, do you know of any other state

18

that lets them in on the assumption that the threat is not

very great?

20

MR. HOWARD

It is a question of what the state

21

administrative officers do with their administration discretion

22

that legislatures may have given to them.

that requires a prohibition of this kind.
QUESTION:

more havoc there than they would in the non-fragile New

MR. HOWARD:

Yes.

We have a very unique fresh-water,

pure-water fishery with a lot of — a small number of fish,

trout, bass, salmon that are very vital to our state and

because of that unique fact the state has a special interest
