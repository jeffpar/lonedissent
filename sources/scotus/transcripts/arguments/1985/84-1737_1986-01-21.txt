Exactly right.

Now, however, the American College

of Physicians has been around a long time, hasn’t it?
MR. LAUBER*

A lot of them have.

one might even precede that.
MR. LAUBER*

And, well — okay.

It's a new tax on an old

16

organization, put it that way.

17

there'd have to be three conditions met.

18

trade or business.

19

the conduct of a trade or business must be unrelated to

20

the accomplishment of the tax exempt purposes of the

21

organization.

22

Now,

For this tax to apply,
There must be a

It must be regularly carried on, and

the American College here has conceded

23

that its publication of commercial aivertising is a trade

24

or business, and that it is regularly carried on by it.

25

The only question, therefore, is whether this advertising

business is substantially reLated to the a:complishment

2

of the respondent’s educational purposes.
Respondent contends that it is related, on the

3
4

theory that the ads it publishes help to educate the

5

doctors who read the magazine.

6

on tha fact that respondeat does not publish general

7

consumer advertising for things like Mercedes Benzes and

8

margarine; rather, they advertise only products that are

9

of professional interest to the doctors who read its

These products are mainly prescription drugs,

12

but also include non-prescription drugs like Tylenol ana

13

aspirin, medical products like support socks, and

14

classified or help wanted advertisements for doctors in

15

search of employment.

16

The question is whether the publication of

17

these advertisements is an educational activity.

18

view, the answer to this question is clearly provided by

19

regulations promulgated by Treasury in 1967 to deal with

20

this varied commercial advertising problem.

21

In our

Example 7 to those regulations describes a

22

professional association like respondent, that puts out a

monthly professional journal.

organization also avoids general consumer adverti'ing and

limits its ads to products of professional interest to

their professional capacity.

Nevertheless, Example 7 of the regulations

3

concludes that the publication of advertising designed

4

and selected in the Banner of

5

advertising is not an educational activity of the kind

6

contemplated by the tax exemption statute.

7

ordinary commercial

Example 7 reasons that such commercial

8

advertising is fundamentally different from an

9

educational activity,

both i.i its governing objective

10

because it aims not to teach but to sell merchandise, and

11

also in its method because its method is the usual method

12

of Madison Avenue which is designed to put the reader in

13

a frame of mind where he wants to buy or to prescribe the

14

advertised product.

15

QUESTION*

Mr. Lauber, do you take the position

16

that commercial advertising can never under any

17

circumstance whatever be substantially related to or

18

contribute importantLy to a tax exempt organization

19

within the meaning of the statute?

20

MR. LAUBER#

Our position is that the test is

QUESTION;

Because whit I think you are arguing

2

for is an absolutely per se rule which could never be

3

varied, notwithstanding the fact that the statute as far

4

as language is not so phrased?

5

MR. LAUBERi

6

Well,

the regulation was

explicitly approved by Congress in 1969.

7

QUESTION*

Well, but Congress didn't change the

8

statute.

It never changed the language that says that —

9

that speaks in terms of "substantially related," or

10

"contribute importantly to the purposes of the tax exempt

11

organizations," so I just wonder whether it's quite fair

12

to say there has to be a blanket per se rule and the

13

statute could never be applied as it's written?

14

MR. LAUBERi

Well, as mentioned in our brief,

15

Jutice O'Connor, there are, one can imagine, examples of

16

what might be called advertisement being deemed related.

17

For example, the IRS has ruled that a company simply list

18

its name with a ounch of other corporate patrons for

19

charitable endeavor on a page in the magazine.

20

would not be commercial advertising because nothing's

21

being advertised.

22

That

Similarly, one can imagine, say, if there's

23

been a favorable laboratory write-up by a scholar of a

24

particular drug, and if the drug company were to have

25

that reprinted in its entirety as it originally was in
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

another magazine, that could be related, but the

2

regulation says that advertising designed and selected in

3

the manner of ordinary commercial advertising is not

4

educational, and we think that is a species of a per se

5

rule.

6

There can be other kinds of advertising outside

7

that are not designed and selected in that manner.

8

Kozinsky, for example, hypothesized a couple of ways a

9

group might be able to run its advertising business

10

differently, where it had much more input into the

11

editing and arrangement of the ads.

12
13
14

Conceivably,

Judge

that might work but if it*s

designed —
QUESTIONS

Well, is the critical factor in your

15

view that if the advertising message is simply an

16

accident of the marketplace, that under these regulations

17

it’s taxable?

18

MR. LAUBERs

That’s a very good point.

That is

19

our position, and what respondent seized upon here is

20

this highly technical advertising designed for a highly

21

technical audience, but that is simply a creature of the

22

marketplace.

23

This is drug advertising which is designed to

24

hit a particular market, and

the market is symmetrical

25

with the people who read this magazine, so it is really a
o

function of the marketplace, that the advertising here

2

takes the technical form that it does.

QUESTION!

While I have you interrupted,

4

ask you one more question.

5

whether something is substantially related to the

6

organization's purpose is a question of fact cr a

question of law?

run — arguably run businesses like museums, shops and so

11

forth, it is a factual increase.

12

particular case of advertising we have a regulation which

13

speaks directly to that, which has given us a narrower

14

question to ask, and the narrower guestion the regulation

15

piescribes is whether or not the advertising is designed

16

and selected in the manner of ordinary commercial

17

advertising.

However, in the

It’s a reiinement of the general factual test,

18
19

■.hich is simply -- reduces the universe of facts you need

20

to look at to come up with the correct answer, and

21

Congress expressly approved this regulation in 1969.
QUESTION!

22

Nr. Lauber, let me follow through on

23

Justice O'Connor's first question.

There is outstanding

24

still a revenue ruling having to do with bar association

25

3

5

How dees that square with your pressing for an
absolute ruling?

6

KB. LAUBERs

Bell/ I think. Justice Blackmun,

7

in the case of the A3A Journal, X think — well, the bar

8

journals, the allocation is based on divvying up the

9

income between

10

the editorial content which is furnished

through subscriptions and dues, and the advertising.

11

I think all the advertising in the ABA Journal

12

is unrelated business income because they advertise

13

things like computers and trips to Bermuda and that kind

14

of thing.

15

the ruling speaks of is allocating expenses as between

16

the cost of publishing the editorial matter and the cost

17

incident to the advertising.

18

between those two streams of income.

19

It's clearly unrelated.

contend that those also are not related to the

educational purposes.
QUESTION*

2

That's against the Revenue ruling,

3

and what I'm leading up to is that if you should prevail

4

here on your general thesis, shouldn't we just remand for

5

determination of which is properly allocable to, as

6

substantially related income and that which is not?
MR. LAUBERs

7

Justice Blackmun,

I'm not sure of

8

the kind of legal notices that are referred to in that

9

*82 Revenue ruling.

It's possible that some legal

10

notices could be exempt from tax on the ground that

11

they're done for the convenience of members.
QUESTION*

12
13

Kell, the Revenue ruling held

flatly, ruled flatly that they were exempt from tax.
MR. LAUBER*

14

Well, I think in any event,

the

15

legal notices are distinguishable from commercial

16

advertising.

17

employment are not commercial advertising because there's

18

no product being advertised, but the best bulk of

19

advertising we have here is commercial advertising for

20

medical products and that is exactly what the regulation

21

speaks to.

22

I mean, one might say that notices of

As I noted before, this is not a new

23

controversy.

24

regulation in 1969.

3

tax-exempt and tax-paying medical journals.

4

After listening for several days to the same

arguments respondent and amici are making here, Congress

journals.

QUESTION*

The House report

Well, now is this the House report

that a company — some substitute of legislation?
HR. LAUBER*

What happened. Justice Rehnguist,

13

is the regulations came out in *67, and there were moves

:4

made on the floor to either stop them or to defer their

15

effective date in 1968, aid those moves were unsuccessful

16

on the promise that hearings would be held the following

17

year to address this issue in full.

18

were commenced in

21

be unrelated to trade or business.

22

And the hearings

the hearings that the

Now, I think the House bill that Mills

23

introduced actually came in after the hearings had begun,

24

but the whole issue had been served up by -*-he Congress

25

the previous year and the hearings had been scheduled, to

QUESTIONS

Wall, how inch stronger do you think

the Government's position is in view of these hearings

that Congress had enacted.

19

It shows that Congress

Now, it's true, Congress only codified a

20

portion of the regulations respecting fragmentation of a

21

journal into advertising and editorial content.

22

not codify the example which speaks about advertising net

23

being related activity, but if they'd approved that part

24

of the regulations in the course of enacting the other

2

And, we think that adds to the deference that

3

should be shown to the Commissioners* construction.

4

short, what Congress said is that, your Committee vents

5

to make clear that such regulations are valid, so we

6

think that this case really presents a very narrow

question in view of this regulation which Congress has

endorsed, and

14

regulation, that the publication of those ads can’t be

educational activity and therefore the ad revenue;; are

16

subject to tax.

17

That means, under the

And respondent's main argument in response to

18

all this is that the regulation doesn’t apply to it.

19

Respondent notes that in Example 7, the professional

20

association that publishes the journal there is said to

21

be tax-exempt under Section 501-C-6 which provides a tax

22

exemption for business leagues and trade associations.

23

Respondent, although it is also a professional

24

association, is organized instead as an educational

25

organization under Section 501-C-3.

Respondent therefore

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

argues that Example 7’s principles should only apply to

2

groups, to publishers who are tax-exempt under 501-06

3

and not to any ether tax-exempt publishers.

4

As we explain in more detail in our brief, this

5

argument is wrong for at least three principal reasons.

6

First of all, the IRS has always interpreted the

7

principles of Example 7 to apply to tax exempt publishers

8

across the board.

9

apply to Example 7, to a 501-C-3 group, and this Court

There are rulings which explicitly

10

has held that the Commissioners’ construction of its own

11

regulation is entitled to deference.

QDESTTONi

Mr. Laaber, I suppose there are

13

instances where the same ad is published in the Annals

14

20

suggesting that there is a slight element of

inconsistency in the result?

22

MR. LAUBERw

I think that’s exacty right,

because respondent’s argument would mean that the same ad

to tax because AMA is exempt under 5D1-C-6,
