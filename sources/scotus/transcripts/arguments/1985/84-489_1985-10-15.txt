ORAL ARGUMENT OF1 '.LEROY S. ZIMMERMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF T’HIE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

M:r. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question presented by this appeal is whether

12

a district court has the a.u+thority to direct the United States

13

Marshals Service to share responsibility with state officials

14

for the production of state inmates to appear in Federal

15

Court at a trial of a civil action.

16

District

This question arose in the course of a civil rights

17

action brought by a state prisoner against Philadelphia County

18

officials for events allegedly occurring while he was in the

19

custody of county prison officials.

20

The magistrate ordered the state custodians to produce

21

the plaintiff and two witnesses.

22

220 miles from the federal courthouse.

23

away and another witness 143 miles away.

24
25

Plaintiff was incarcerated
One witness 218 miles

Recognizing the Iburden that is placed on the state
custodians, the magistrate ordered that state custodians
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

transport the inmates to

2

there to transfer custody to the United States Marshals, who

3

would transport the prisiioners from the House of Detention

4

to the Federal Courthouses and maintain custody of them while

5

they were inside the courrthouse.

6

the Philadelphia House of Detention,

Well, the magistrate's order transferring custody

7

from state to federal offficers and the apportion of trans­

8

portation responsibilities were

9

that the U.S. Marshal regularly transported federal prisoners

10

between the Philadelphia

11

Courthouse.

12

based

in part on his knowledge

House of Detention and the Federal

This arrangememt permitted state custodians to avoid

13

the deployment of guards

14

that of maintaining prison security, to transferring prisoners.

15

from their primary responsibility,

The U.S. Marshaals Service intervened to oppose the

16

orders, arguing that no aauthority exists to support such orders.

17

In rejecting thie Marshals' contentions, the magistrate

18

recognized that the explosion of federal civil rights litigation

19

by state prisoners and strained available resources.

20

Consequently, in fashioniing a procedure, the magistrate stressed

21

that his order placed comsiderable burden on state officials,

22

but the Marshal really would have very little burden, if any

23

at all.

24
25

The Court of Apipeals in a split decision did net
dispute the magistrate's

factual and pragmatic conclusiors,

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

rather, Judge Gibbons, writing for the Court, concluded that

2

no statutory authority, including the All Writs Act, supported

3

the magistrate's order, apportioning the transportation

4

responsibility between state officials and the United States

5

Marshals.

6

The Court held that the Marshal is obligated to main­

7

tain custody over the prisoners while they are in the courthouse.

8

In fact, the Court of Appeals held that if security concerns

9

justify it, the Marshal could be ordered to take custody of

10

state prisoners outside the courthouse.

11

Now, it is our position --

12

QUESTION:

General Zimmerman, as I understand it,

13

the state does not contest that part of the magistrate's order

14

which required transportation from a correctional facility

15

to Philadelphia.

16

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

17

QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.

And, the government doesn't challenge

18

that part of the Court of Appeals' decision which required

19

the furnishing of security within the Federal Courthouse?

20

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

21

QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.

So, what we are talking about is trans­

22

portation from the State Correctional Center in Philadelphia

23

to the Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia.

24

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

25

It is our position that the All Writs Act --

Yes.

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

2

QUESTION:

Do you have a Federal House of Detention

in Philadelphia?

3

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

I beg your pardon?

Do you have a Federal House of -- Do you

have any place where federal prisoners are kept in Philadelphia?

6

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

No.

The House of Detention in

7

Philadelphia, operated by the County of Philadelphia, is a

8

designated repository by the Federal Marshals to house federal

9

prisoners.

10

QUESTION:

So, what this ruling says is that they

11

can pick up their own prisoners and transfer them, but they

12

don't have to pick up these from the exact same place?

13

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

This ruling -- The magistrate, in

14

fashioning this ruling, Justice Marshall, said that because

15

they regularly -- in considering this, because the Marshals

16

regularly went back and forth, that it was not a burden on

17

them to transport state prisoners to Federal Court in civil

18

rights actions.

19

20

QUESTION:

General, I don't suppose your submission

would be limited to that fortutious circumstance.

21

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

22

QUESTION:

No, Justice White.

You would think any time in the 1983 action

23

the Federal Marshals should be required to bring the plaintiff,

24

if he is a prisoner, and witnesses from the prison, furnish

25

any of that transportation.
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Justice White, so long as it is not

2

an inordinate burden on the Federal Marshals.

3

that is something — I think the source of the powers in the

4

All Writs Act, but I think that beyond that then there is a

5

matter of discretion, assuming that point of law where the

6

magistrate can take into account the respective burdens —

7

QUESTION;

I think that

If it is a question of authority, why,

8

if they have authority or if they are obligated to do this

9

under the law, it wouldn't make any difference what the burden

10

is, would it?

11

MR. ZIMMERMAN;

12

It is our position that the All Writs Act —

lection.

No.

Mr. Attorney General, refresh my recol

How far was the transportation in terms of miles?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Five miles from the House of Detention

in Philadelphia to the Federal Courthouse.
QUESTION:

And, you mentioned burden.

I realize

that you can make all sorts of suppositious cases, but suppose
it were 50 miles.

Would the rule still be the same?

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Well, Justice Powell, I don't think

that the question of burden is in this particular case.

There

22

is no record in this case to determine whether it were not

23

nor is there a challenge to the magistrate's exercise of

24

discretion by the Marshals.

25

The sole source, the focus of the question in this
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

case is whether or not the All Writs Act provides the authority,

2

the power in the court, to fashion such a writ as it did in

3

this case.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

6

It is our position that —

7

QUESTION:

And, that would apply to the 50 miles?
Yes, sir.

General Zimmerman, suppose that you are

8

somehow correct that the All Writs Act could encompass such

9

a power on the part of the Federal Court to order this

10

transportation, what requirements would you then think

11

a judge or magistrate would have to find in order to justify

12

such an order?

13

determine that there should be cost shifting from the state

14

to the federal government?

15

an order like this under the All Writs Act if you are correct?

16

Is it enough that the magistrate or judge

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Is that alone enough to justify

Justice O'Connor, I don't think that

17

this is a question solely of money.

18

this is a question of allocation of manpower and getting prisoners

19

from a place where they are incarcerated to a place where their

20

rights would be vindicated.

21

It is our position that

Obviously, money is involved, but it is a question

22

of manpower and the allocation of manpower from maintaining

23

the operation of prisons in a secure fashion.

24
25

That is part of the question of this burden.
does involve money.

It

QUESTION:

1

What, requirements do you think would have

2

to be met under the All WFrits Act if your position about it is

3

valid --

4

MR. ZIMMERMANS

5

QUESTION:

Well, I believe —

-- to justify such an order?

I think

6

the language of the Act incorporates words such as necessasry

7

and appropriate.

8

What is there in this case other than a cost shifting in affect?

9

What would make it necessary and appropriate?

MR. ZIMMERMANs

In this particular case -- It is

10

not our argument that it is necessary, but I do believe that

11

the Act -- Of course, the Act says, "appropriate in aid

12

the respective jurisdiction of the Court."

13

of

And, I suggest that in this case, as well as being

14

agreeable to the usage and the principle of law -- In this

15

case, the All Writs Act was designed to give the courts that

16

flexibility and I believe that when there is a determination

17

made and there is a burden, anything that lessens that burden,

18

that burden to produce a prisoner, and obviously there has

19

to be --

20

QUESTION:

It is a burden on both the federal and

21

state agencies to have to do this.

22

and there is always a cost.

23

magistrate in making such a determination?

24
25

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

There is always a burden

What is to guide a court or

As we argue, if the All Writs Act

is the source of the Court1 s power, and I believe that it is
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

here, then, of course, there will be a question in each of

2

the cases, a matter of discretion of the magistrate to exercise

3

discretion, whether or not he has acted correctly in looking

4

at the burden of producing a witness.

5

In civil rights: cases, it is necessary frequently

6

for the Court to make a determination on whether or not to

7

produce the prisoner or witness in the court.

8
9

Now, in examining and making that decision, there
are burdens that are going to be placed if the Court decides

10

the prisoner should be there or the witnesses ought to be there

11

to better vindicate the rights, to have a more clearly and

12

informed court.

13

QUESTION:

In this case, does the state take the

14

position that it would not have obeyed and ad testificandum

15

order to have the prisoner transported?

16
17
18

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

No, it does not take that position,

Justice O'Connor.
The All Writs Act is designed to give the court the

19

flexibility you say is necessary to free the courts from the

20

constraints of historic practice where new solutions are

21

essential to solve new problems.

22

that flexibility, the All Writs Act, recognizing it as a

23

judicial arsenal from which the courts can develop new tools

24

as the need arises.

25

And, this Court has reaffirmed

Now, the Act is worded broadly.

As I said a moment

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

again, a new writ only satisfy two requirements, that it be

2

necessary or appropriate in aid

3

and agreeable to the usages and the principles of law.

4

of the court's jurisdiction,

Now, that first requirement, we feel that there is

5

no question that the underlying civil rights action was within

6

the District Court's jurisdiction and I submit the magistrate's

7

orders were appropriate in aide of that Court's jurisdiction.

8

The explosion of civil rights litigation, especially

9

by prisoners, has increased the requirement for the production

10

of prisoners in court and the corresponding burden on the

11

custodians who must produce those prisoners.

QUESTION:

General, if this action were in state

court, and it could have been there, could it not?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:
QUESTION:

Then we would have no problem at all.

MR. ZIMMERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Justice.

Well, the state court —

I ta.ke it the U.S. Marshals would not

be involved.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

So, the expense would be that of the

Commonwealth.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

It would be.

Especially, in (civil rights cases, the court must
often decide whether to require — As I indicated, whether
to require the production of these prisoner witnesses in court.
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

In making that decision, the Court must weigh the relevance

2

or the importance of probable testimony against the burden

3

of producing the prisoner witnesses.

4

QUESTION:

General, pursuing Justice Blackmun's question

5

another step, if this had been in the state court and the

6

plaintiff was not an indigent — He was in prison, but he wanted

7

witnesses from the state prison, wouldn't you make him pay

8

the witness fees and wouldn't you make him pay the transportation?

9

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

No, Justice White, he would not be

10

required -- If the witnesses were in prison, he would not be

11

required to pay those.

12
13

QUESTION:

Even though the plaintiff is not an

indigent?

14

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Well, if he is an indigent --

Well, I said —
-- he would not be required to pay.

17

If he were not indigent, yes, Justice White, he would be required

18

to pay the cost.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

And, in this case then, if this person

were not an indigent, wouldn't he have to pay?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

In the case of a state prisoner here

22

in this case?

23

of litigation, that may be taxed against him, yes.

24
25

He would eventually, depending on the outcome

QUESTION:

Okay.

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, while this state
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

prisoner is in Philadelphia, who pays for his expenses there,

2

the federal government?

3

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

The arrangement is entered into between

4

the Marshals Service and the Philadelphia County House of

5

Detention.

6

QUESTION:

7

this prisoner here.

8

in Philadelphia?

9

I am talking about in a case like this,
Who would pay for his living expenses

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

The arrangement there is between

10

Philadelphia and the U.S. Marshals in this case.

11

state prisoners would not be transported from the place of

12

incarceration in Philadelphia to the House of Detention.

13

They would go directly to the Federal Courthouse.

14

15

QUESTION:
one day.

16
17
18
19

Well, suppose the case lasted more than

Who would pay the expenses?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

State Penitentiary there.

QUESTION:

Then the state would pay his expenses?

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

22

QUESTION:

25

They would not go back to the House

of Detention ordinarily, not as state prisoners.

21

24

A state prisoner would be returned

to the place in Philadelphia called Greaterford which is the

20

23

Ordinarily,

That is correct.

Now, in this case, who would pay his

expenses?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

In this particular case, the expenses

would be worked out in accordance with a voluntary agreement
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

between the Marshals Service and the County of Philadelphia.
QUESTION:

2
3

I am trying to find out what is that

voluntary agreement.

4

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Well, I don't know the correct

5

terms — I don't know the exact terms of that agreement in

6

this particular case, Justice Marshall.

7

QUESTION:

Well, you talk about the additional --

8

There are no additional expenses in this case.

9

that this bus goes every day?

10

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Is it admitted

There is no record in this case,

11

but the magistrate found in making his order that the bus --

12

The Marshals traveled regularly to and from the House of

13

Detention to the Federal Courthouse.

14
15

QUESTION:

And, is there any showing that this

precedent would cause additional expense?

16

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

There is no showing of any kind because

17

there is no record.

18

burden.

19

a power, a power question of the Court and the authority of

20

the magistrate under the All Writs Act.

21

And, in this case, we are not arguing

I don't think burden is involved here.

QUESTION:

It is strictly

May I ask, during the day at the Federal

22

Courthouse he is in federal custody, as I understand it, and

23

nobody disputes that.

24

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

Who buys his lunch if he has to spend
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

the day there?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Well, I am not certain about who

3

buys his lunch in the Federal Courthouse, but from my experience

4

as Attorney General as a prosecutor I believe that his lunch

5

would be provided by the United States Marshals because he

6

is in their custody inside the courthouse in this case.

7

QUESTION:

General Zimmerman, when you say you are

8

not arguing burden, and yet I take it that the magistrate would

9

not have been free to say that the state has paid enough of

10

these costs so I am going to pick someone out of the courtroom

11

here and have him required to pay the expenses from the Detention

12

Center in Philadelphia to the Federal Courthouse.

13

just pick someone from random, why can he pick the federal

14

government?

15
16
17
18
19

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

If he can't

I believe that in this particular

case anything that will lessen that burden of proceeding -QUESTION:

But, you conceded, I take it, that you

can't call upon bystanders to lessen the burden.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

I don't take the position in this

20

case that Section 1651, the All Writs Act, is unlimited.

21

are limitations.

22

cannot order somebody to do something that is not in the course

23

of their duties.

24
25

There

The limitations are that certainly the Court

QUESTION:

All the All Writs Act gives you is a remedy

if there is something you are entitled to under some other
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

standard.

Why are you entitled to it?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

I believe the Court was entitled

3

to do what it did here in order to get these witnesses from

4

where they are incarcerated to a federal court to vindicate

5

their rights.

6

That is a very important aspect of this.

QUESTION:

But, it is conceded, isn't it, that the

7

magistrate also had power to bring -- to order the state to

8

bring the people from the Correction Center in Western

9

Pennsylvania to the Federal Courthouse.

10

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

That is correct and that is what

11

he did in this case.

12

case was on the state custodian.

13

QUESTION:

And, most of the burden in this particular
There was very little --

My question wasn't from the Correctional

14

Center to the Philadelphia.

15

all the way to the Federal Courthouse.

16

authority, didn't he, to require the state to do all of that.

17

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

I said from the Correctional Center
The Marshal had the

The magistrate.

I am sorry, the magistrate, yes.
The magistrate had the authority

20

and, in fact, did in this case say bring the prisoners from

21

wherever they are incarcerated throughout the Commonwealth

22

of Pennsylvania in the various institutions to Philadelphia.

23

Now, in order to lessen --

24

QUESTION:

25

But now my question is do you or do you

not admit that he would have had the authority to go further
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

and say not just bring them to Philadelphia, but bring them

2

to the Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia?

3

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Yes, he would have, but I argue in

4

this case he considered t'.he burden and an attempt to lessen

5

the burden on the state ciustodian somewhat.

6

In this case minimally I concede, but we are not

7

focusing on that in this case.

8

in this case is whether or not the magistrate -- the problem

9

in this case is whether tlhe magistrate had the authority to

I believe that the principle

10

do what he did and I beli<eve the All Writs Act, of course,

11

gives him that authority because of the need, to vary writs,

12

to vary orders.

13

The question of burden in producing persons makes --

14

That has to be examined a:nd wherever it makes it more likely that

15

the Court will be able to hear and to consider all of the evidence

16

relevant to the merits of a claim, clearly that aids the Court

17

in an informed exercise of its jurisdiction.

18

Now, the Marshals argue that these orders are neither

19

appropriate or necessary Ibecause there already exists the general

20

habeas corpus statute whi<ch they say places the full burden

21

on the custodian to produce the prisoners in the Federal Court­

22

house .

23

This argument, we believe, ignores the point that

24

some cases may call for miodification of traditional procedure.

25

And, where modification i:s determined to be necessary or
17
ALDERSO'N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

appropriate in aid of the Court's jurisdiction, the power to

2

modify is found not in the habeas corpus statute, but in the

3

All Writs Act.

4

the end for purposes of analysis as the Marshals argue, but

5

really the beginning.

6

Thus, the habeas corpus statute is really not

Similar considerations, I submit, support the con­

7

clusion that the order under review is as required by the All

8

Writs Act agreeable to the usages and principles of law.

9

Certainly, transfer of custody violates no positive

10

congressional command nor does it violate any common law rule,

11

rather the order modifies traditional procedure to respond

12

to modern developments in our ever-expanding jurisprudence.

13

The essential principal underlying the writ of habeas

14

corpus ad testificandum is affording the Court an orderly and

15

an efficient means of procedure for securing the testimony

16

of prisoner witnesses.

17

by a modification of the writ directing the transfer of a prisoner

18

from the custodian to a substitute custodian.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

21

This principle hardly is subverted

Was a writ issued in this case?
An order was issued in this case,

Justice White, by the magistrate, by Magistrate Hall.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General --

23

QUESTION:

Why wasn't there just a write of habeas

24
25

corpus?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

The magistrate did not label the
18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

writ.

2

this case.

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

In the calculus of the magistrate,

and without a record I suggest it is impossible to be precise,

that order, you will see that he took into account the principles

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK IRVING LEVY, ESQ.

Mr. Levy?

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LEVY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The state's argument here is, in essence, that the
magistrate's order is reasonable.

The trial courts have broad

10

authority to impose reasonable obligations on the United States

11

Marshals Service and that our objection to the order are, as

12

in the words of the state's reply brief, merely dry formalism.

13

All of that is far from correct.

The United States

14

Marshals Service is an arm of the Executive Branch of the federal

15

government.

16

of the Department of Justice, and under the supervision of

17

the Attorney General, and is funded through Department of Justice

18

appropriations.

19

Marshals are appointed by the President, is part

In fact, this Court in its opinion in the Naggle

20

case reported in 135 U.S., specifically recognized that the

21

Marshals Service is within the Executive Branch.

22

Thus, contrary to the premise of the state's argument,

23

the Marshals Service is not the hand-maiden or the administrative

24

staff of the courts subject to whatever duties judges, in their

25

discretion, may devise.
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Now, of course, the Marshals Service and the courts

2

have developed a sound and cooperative working relation that

3

well serves the effective administration of justice.

4

is by law subject to the control of federal judges in many

5

respects.

6

as an executive official and agrees to do things that legally

7

could not be required.

8

in this case are fortunately very rare.

9

The Marshal

In addition, the Marshal often exercises his discretion

Thus, disputes of the kind involved

But, that cooperative arrangement does not negate

10

the principle that there must be a source of statutory authorizaticj) n

11

before a court can require the Marshal, as part of the Executive

12

Branch of the federal government, to take a particular action

13

and expend its funds in a particular way.

14

The Marshal has myriad responsibilities and only

15

limited resources with which to carry them out.

16

principal responsibilities are the security of the courthouse,

17

custody over and transportation of federal prisoners needed

18

in federal court, execution of arrest warrants, and seizure

19

of forfeited property, and implementation of the Witness Protection

20

Program.

21

Among its

To perform these duties, there are fewer than 1,000

22

Deputy Marshals nationwide, while there are 500 active federal

23

district judges and 250 full-time magistrates in 500 federal

24

court facilities around the country.

25

The allocation among those various duties of the
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

finite resources appropriated to the Marshal is at the heart

2

of the Executive Branch's function.

3

In the aggregate, orders of the type entered by the

4

magistrate here will impose a substantial burden on the Marshals

5

Service and interfere with its discharge of its statutorily

6

assigned responsibilities.

7

In addition, a trial court in any given case, is

8

in no position to assess these considerations and decide how

9

the Marshals' resources are to be deployed overall.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, can I interrupt with a question

11

that goes to the question of power rather than whether it is

12

a good idea or not?

13

MR. LEVY:

Sure.

14

QUESTION:

Supposing you had an emergency situation,

15

a fire at the County Detention Center or an escape or a riot

16

or something like that, and the state was short of personnel

17

and couldn't get a witness to the courthouse and they let the

18

district judge know and the district judge said, well, we want

19

to go ahead with the trial and it is the only way we can get

20

the witness here.

21

the trial go forward is to send a Marshal out and pick him

22

up.

23

to do that?

24
25

It is absolutely necessary in order to have

Would you. make the same argument that he has no power

MR. LEVY:

Well, first, in those circumstances it

is exceedingly likely that the Marshal would agree to go out
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

and do that.
QUESTION:

2

Let's assume the question is one of power.

3

In that situation, would the judge have the power to order

4

the Marshal to --

5

MR. LEVY:

The answer is he might, but that is a

6

much different situation from what we have here.

In that situation

7

the Marshal would not be required in the first instance to

8

bear the transportation or production burden, rather the court

9

would have entered the ad testificandum writ to the custodian

10

and when the custodian was unable or in this instance unwilling

11

to comply, the court, in effect, would enter a second order,

12

a compliance order, enforcement or sanction order.

13
14

QUESTION:

What would be the source of the federal judge s

authority to enter such an order?

15

MR. LEVY:

Well, for example, if the state custodian

16

simply refused to comply with an order that was within his

17

capability --

18

QUESTION:

Well, take my hypothetical.

It is just

19

an emergency and the judge thinks the only way he could really

20

get the witness there is to order the Marshal to go out and

21

get him.

22

MR. LEVY:

Well, the question would be whether --

23

as part of enforcing an order that directive to the Marshal

24

would be appropriate.

25

but that is a much different sort of issue than is presented

There are questions whether it would,

produce that --

MR. LEVY:

Would there

I am doubtful that there would be.

I

am not taking a categorical position on it.

9

QUESTION:

10

same issue that we have here?

11

MR. LEVY:

Isn't that, in jurisdictional terms, the

Well, net necessarily.

As I say the

12

jurisdictional question in this case is whether the magistrate

13

has the authority, the judicial power to require the Marshal

14

in the first instance to step into the state's shoes and become

15

the principle respondent for producing the body of the prisoner.

16

That is not the situation --

17

QUESTION:

18
19

He just delivers him from the intermediate

point to the courthouse.
MR. LEVY:

But, the Marshal would not be acting in

20

lieu of or as the surrogate custodian in that case.

21

would be acting as a law enforcement official enforcing a federal

22

court order that the state was unable to comply with.

23
24
25

The Marshal

That enforcement responsibility of the Marshal simply
presents a different question than the one in this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, getting it closer to this case,

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

2

of Detention in Philadelphia that I need for trial this after­

to do it because it was not inconsistent or a burden on his

other responsibilities.

6

In this case, as the Attorney General of Pennsylvania

7

stated, there is no record and the magistrate did not make

8

any specific findings about either the burden on the state

9

in this case.

All he said generally was that there was a burden

10

on the state in general or the burden on the Marshal in this

11

case.

12

In contrast to the hypothetical, Justice Marshall,

13

I am advised, just as an illustration, that the Marshal typically

14

brings between six and twelve prisoners from the Philadelphia

15

Detention Center to the Federal Courthouse on an average day.

MR. LEVY:

QUESTION:

MR. LEVY:

That is correct.

It might require additional

There are any number

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

of ways in which this could impose a very serious burden on

2

the Marshal and that would interfere with the Marshal's

3

execution of its other obligations.

4

Now, Congress could certainly decide as a policy

5

matter that the United States Marshals Service should transport

6

these prisoners and Congress could make available the necessary

7

funds to do so, but we don't have that here.

8
9

QUESTION:
my mind.

Let me get one other thing straight in

The government concedes, as I understand it, that

10

after the prisoners and witnesses are delivered to the Federal

11

Courthouse -- I guess they are taken to a lockup downstairs

12

or something -- that the Marshal then can be ordered to continue

13

to hold custody of them in the elevators and throughout the

14

building, not merely in the courtroom.

responsibility, that is correct.
QUESTION:

Supposing you had a situation as you do

in Chicago where there is a Federal Detention Center about
a block from the Federal Courthouse.

Could they be ordered

to take custody at the Federal Detention Center and haul them
back and forth across Jackson Parkway?
MR. LEVY:

Again, it is a matter of judicial power

to require the Marshal to do that.
QUESTION:

We think not.

But, you would say the extent of judicial

power is the exterior walls of the building which houses the
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Federal Courthouse?

2

MR. LEVY:

The Court of Appeals looked over a some­

3

what broader exception where the security needed required the

4

custody be transferred outside the courthouse.

5

exactly what that means, but they left that open.

6

It is unclear

But, the rationale is not that the Marshal has any

7

independent responsibility for the prisoner-witnesses, but

8

rather he has responsibility for the security of the courthouse.

9

So, when they are in the courthouse, whether it is in the lockup

10

or the elevator or the courtroom, the Marshal would be

11

responsible for custody.

12

When they are outside the courthouse, even in a federal

13

jail or detention center, that would not be within the scope

14

of 569(a), the courthouse security provision for the Marshal.

15

QUESTION:

But, if the Marshal has the responsibility

16

for the courthouse, where does the judge get the power to tell

17

the Marshal what do it in the courthouse?

18
19

20

MR. LEVY:

Well, the Marshal would have the dis­

cretion how to implement the courthouse security.
QUESTION:

The judge can order the Marshal though

21

to be responsible for security in the elevator.

22

a matter for the Marshal to decide for himself.

MR. LEVY:

That is not

25

QUESTION:

That is correct.

In other words, the judge should defer

to the expertise of the Marshal in construing that statute.
31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. LEVY:

Well, as on any statutory construction,

2

the reading of the agency whose statute it is is entitled to

3

substantial deference.

4

but it would be relevant and significant.

5

It would be controlling, of course,

Now, absent legislative authorization, our sub­

6

mission is that a court cannot require the Marshal to transport

7

state prisoners regardless of its view of the reasonableness

8

of that order.

9

The question then is whether there is any lav/ful

10

authority for the transportation order issued in this case.

11

There plainly is no such explicit authority, so the question

12

is one of implied authority.

13

Now, our analysis starts from the proposition, which

14

is essentially undisputed, that under settled principles, it

15

is the obligation of the custodian to produce its prisoners

16

in court pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.

17

Indeed, if the prisoners in this case were in federal

18

rather than state custody, it would be the responsibility of

19

the Marshal to transport them to court.

20
21

The result we seek here asks that state to do no
more with respect to its own prisoners.

22

The custodian's obligation to produce --

23

QUESTION:

Of course, that isn't necessarily a

24

compelling argument, because what may be permissible as the

25

distribution of burden within the federal system may not be
32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

permissible when you go outside the federal system and ask

2

the state to produce some --

3

MR. LEVY:

Our point here though is that the custodian

4

has the obligation and we agree that obligation would apply

5

to us if these were federal prisoners, just as it applies to

6

the state where they are state prisoners.

7

Now, the custodian's obligation to produce its

8

prisoners existed at common law and is carried forward by the

9

express terms of the federal habeas corpus statute.

In fact,

10

the whole theory of the ad testificandum writ requires that

11

the custodian be the respondents and bring its prisoners to

12

court since it is the custodian that has the control over the

13

prisoner.

14

It is the fact that custody that fixes the custodian

15

mandatory and non-delegable legal duty.

16

two important considerations.

17

one else, has a public duty to make available evidence in its

18

possession, here, the prisoner himself, even if that imposes

19

a burden or is inconvenient.

20

This obligation reflects

First, the custodian, like ever

And, second, the custodial state has a penal interest

21

in the continued confinement of the prisoner, since it is that

22

confinement that gives rise to the special problems and added

23

expense of obtaining the prisoner in court.

24

or unreasonable for the law to impose the production obligation

25

on the custodian.

It is not unfair

33

litigation, the entire system has operated on the questioned

rule that the production obligation rests on the custodian.

QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, what if someone commenced a

MR. LEVY:

I would also say, Justice White, that there is a statute that

provides that the Marshal is to be allowed the expense of

8

transporting prisoners.

a substantive authorization to transport prisoners, but it

11

it will be covered by the United States Treasury.

12

QUESTION:

May I ask as a follow-up on Justice White's

13

question that if instead of volunteering to do the transporta­

14

tion initially you had a situation in which the state had done

15

the transportation, as was true in the Seventh Circuit case,

16

and then came in and asked for reimbursement from the Marshal.

17

The Seventh Circuit held that they could be ordered to reim­

18

burse them.

19

You, of course, disagree with that case, but would

you agree that the Marshal could voluntarily reimburse the

state for the cost of transportation?

QUESTION:

Your view is the Marshal has greater

discretion than the judge?
MR. LEVY:

It is a common situation.

For example,

7

the United States Attorney has discretion to prosecute or not

taking into consideration any number of factors.

9

It would never be thought though that simply from

10

that a court could require the U.S. Attorney to exercise that

authority in a particular way and at the direction of the court.

Now, let me say that, first, the Attorney General
has promulgated regulations that say the Marshal can enter
into intergovernmental or cooperative agreements.

So, the

And, second, the Marshal, in fact, does provide

assistance to states in many areas.

5

had been committed.

6

the Marshals' discretion for free or in transporting state

7

8

will often help the states do that without charge.

9

QUESTION:

For example, apprehending

The Marshals will assist the states in

The Marshal

Why is the Marshal willing to do this

10

latter thing, transport prisoners between states for state

11

proceedings, but not to do what the magistrate in this case

12
13

said he should do?
MR. LEVY:

Once again, the Marshal would be free

14

in this case, but in those other instances, he decides that

15

set of circumstances does not detract from the exercise of
his other duties.
He may, for example, have a plane -- this is one
of the hypotheticals the Court suggested — and he knows that
there is empty space and no additional guards would be needed.
So, he exercises his discretion to assist the state.
The order in this case doesn't depend in any way
on that determination.

And, the authority of a court, the

power of a court to order the Marshal to do simply wouldn't
be workable if it depended on that kind of precises deployment

that are entrusted to the Marshal as an executive official.

QUESTION:

6

It can order the Marshals to attend

7

MR. LEVY:

That is correct.

8

QUESTION:

And, it could order the Marshal to execute

9

any lawful writs, process of papers, issued out of the court.

10

MR. LEVY:

Anything that is properly addressed.

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

12

MR. LEVY:

Let me discuss the statute there which

13

is what the magistrate specifically relied on, 28 U.S.C. 569(b),

14

which provides that the Marshal shall execute all lawful writs,

15

process and orders of federal courts.

16

That provision, which has been in the Code since

17

1789, sets for the Marshals traditional obligation to execute

18

court orders.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

It establishes the Marshal as the designated official
for executing judicial process and makes clear that the Marshal,
even though a part of the Executive Branch, has a mandatory
duty to do so.

We concede all of that.

But, Section 569(b) is not an independent, affirmative
source of judicial authority to address orders to the Marshal.
Rather, it simply requires that the Marshal execute those orders
44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that under some other source of lawful authority are properly

2

directed to it.
To give a specific illustration, the case at hand,

3
4

the fact that a trial court is empowered to issue an ad testifi­

5

candum writ to someone, that is the custodian, does not mean

6

that it can issue the writ to the Marshal.

7

A contrary conclusion would mean that the Marshal

8

can be required to perform any order whose substantive terms

9

are not prohibited.

10

Under this theory, any court -- any order that a

11

court can enter at all could be directed against the Marshal

12

in the first instance, but simply by the fact that it is addressed

13

to him the Marshal would be bound to carry it out.

14

QUESTION:

But now here the Marshal could have issued

15

the subpoena ad testificandum and directed the Marshal to deliver

16

to the custodian of the state prison, could he not?

17
18
19

MR. LEVY:

I am afraid I didn't understand the question,

QUESTION:

of habeas corpus ad testificandum to produce these witnesses

22

to serve that writ on the custodian.

23

MR. LEVY:

To serve the writ, yes.

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

25

MR. LEVY:

That is right.

But, that is far different.

to the state and to the Marshals, that is correct.

11

QUESTION:

Well, who served them on the state?

12

MR. LEVY:

I am not certain of the answer to that.

13

It may have been that they were simply served by mail or that

the Marshal may have served them.

15

that they were properly served.

QUESTION:

I simply don't know what arrangements

Mr. Levy, as I understand it, since about

22

1976 or 1977 the circuits that have addressed this problem

23

have all gone the other way from the Third Circuit.

24

the Marshals Service or the Attorney General ever asked Congress

25

to take a look at this problem in the intervening period?

8

resolved, as we told the Court before.

Certainly there are finite resources on both sides,
