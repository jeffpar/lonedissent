claiming deductions by taxpayars that use the accrual

proper tima for accruing tax deductions is governed by

MR. LAUBER*

Well,

there is a let tc say atcut

10

that.

The Revenue Cede treats insurance companies in e

11

unique

manner.

12

Subchapter L, that just governs insurance companies,

13

Congress allows insurance companies alone cf all

14

taxpayers to claim current deductions for additions to

15

reserves they establish to pay off life insurance and

16

disability claims.

17

There's a whole subchapter cf the Cede,

So, they are allowed to deduct these reserves

statute

21

on their books, but they can't deduct them lecause

22

they're not allowed to by the Revenue Code.

2

liability?

3

HE. IAUBEE;

Se agree with that.

Ir. fact the

4

accountants for the respondent required that a reserve

5

he set up fcr these ccr.tingert liabilities at the ere cf

6

the year, and they found

7

generally accepted accounting principles, but this Court

8

has often held, most recently in Thor Fewer Tool

9

Company, and earlier in Triple-A, that the fact that a

tn a t was consistent with

10

deduction, an accrual is proper fcr financial accounting

11

purposes, is not dispositive fcr tax purposes because cf

12

very different objectives that the two accounting

13

systems have.

14

In this rise we think it is clear that

15

respondent at the close of its tax year had incurred nc

16

obligation to pay the progressive jackpots to anyone.

17

Indeed, there is no one in the world who could at that

18

moment assert any possible claim to those funds.

and that

just strikes

me as very extrema position to argue.
NE. lAUBEEs

That isn't cur position.

Cur

position is, what precludes a deduction is not the fact
that they have a liability now, which might be -- they
might be divested of if they go out into bankruptcy or
go out of business, or lose their License.
r

Cur position is, they can't deduct it because
they have no present liability to make a payment.

It’s

net that they have a liability that they might get cut
of.
