that the engineers or the Arctic Star were employed as

seamen because the nature of their work was maritime.

7

The Court of Appeals' degree of freedom to

substitute its own determination in this regard depends

in our analysis upon whether that Court disagreed with

the trial judge’s understanding cf how to define the

11

term "employed as a seaman," in which case it would be

12

free to substitute its own definition, or whether it

13

disagreed with the district court’s interpretation of

14

the facts, in which case it would be required to pay

15

deference to the trial judge's findings under the

16

clearly erroneous rule.

QUESTION*

5

Mr. Barnes, the ultimate question

6

of whether the workers were seamen, is it a mixed

7

question of fact and law, do you suppose?
MR. BARNES:

8
9

Well, that depends in our

analysis on what the issue is.

10

QUESTION:

If the question is —

The ultimate determination whether

11

someone is a seaman, is that a mixed question of fact

12

and law?

13

MR. BARNES*

It has both elements to it.

If

14

the dispute is over how you define the term "seaman,n

15

from our standpoint, what character of duties make

16

someone a seaman, if that is what is at issue, you have

17

the legal aspect of that question.

18

If the issue is what are the character o': the

19

duties of these particular workers, then that aspect of

20

the determination is factual.

The subsidiary fact finding that

22

goes into it would be factual?

23

MR. BARNES;

The Ninth Circuit mentioned that

24

the Arctic Star spends in its opinion more time at

25

anchor than she does under way, that is true.
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

But in

1

the regulations and in the Ninth Circuit opinion itself,

2

there is no rule of law which develops that a barge

3

which is not self-propelled cannot be staffed by

4

seamen,

5

specifically deal with that kind of situation.

And indeed, the Administrator’s regulations

6

The case that earlier arose here indeed

7

involved this very kind of situation. Your Honor,

8

involved, for instance, dredging barges.

9

distinction that was drawn — dredging barges, which of

10

It

And the

course are also towed; they are not self-propelled.

11

The distinction that developed from the cases

12

is whether the particular workers that are at issue are

13

part of that vessel’s crew, meaning their work is to

14

maintain that vessel, or whether they are really

15

floating miners, whether their work

16

of the dredging crew and the vessel carcies them to

17

their work.

really is to be part

That’s the difference.

But there is io — in fact., it’s to the

18
19

contrary.

The regulations of the Administrator provide

20

that on a — they specifically deal with a

21

non-self-propelled barge, and they specify that whether

22

a hand aboard a non-self-prop elled barge is a seaman

23

depends on whether principally his duties are maritime

24

in character or whether, by contrast, he is more like a

25

floating stevedore or whether he is involved in the

HR. BARNES*

They are engineers.
They were not licensed?
They are not Coast Guard

apply to this industry and these types of crafts.

10
11

QUESTIONS

Is that non-licensure fact of any

significance in the case?

12

HR. BARNES;

In my opinion it is not.

The

13

trial judge determined

that -- because the trial judge

14

had before her a discussion of what duties a licensed

15

seaman does, a licensed marine engineer does.

16

the witnesses she reviewed — before her were reviewed,

17

a question of which of these duties seemed to describe

18

those of the engineers aboard the Arctic Star .

And with

And a major point in the opinion and in her

19

fact finding in that the duties of these particular

21

engineers are the duties of aarine engineers and they

22

are the essential equivalent of what a marine Coast

What the trial judge determined, to follow up

on where we were, is that these marine engineers are

seamen because their duties a re- maritime, and the

10

specific fact findings that she made are important to

review,

because they were these.
First, that these engineers were responsible

for maintaining all the systems for the operation of

Second, that they had to be available on call

Third, th?.t they performed the tasks cf Coast

Fourth, that theirs was the work of a marine

Fifth, that they were members cf the crew of

25

character.

the findings of fact and

Yes.
Or that we don’t have to find

12

whether they’re clearly erroneous, because they involve

13

legal interpretations.

14

They did neither one.

What the Ninth Circuit did is this.

15

Initially, it felt that the determination of the whole

16

question of what is seaman status is a question of law,

17

and boldly in its first opinion said:

18

question of law and we are free to substitute cur

19

determination for that of the trial court.

This is a

We moved for a rehearing en banc, challenging

21

that independence and pointing out that it was contrary

22

to the established standard of review in such questions

23

in the Supreme Court and in the Ninth Circuit cases.

24

And in a revised opinion, the Ninth Circuit did this,

25

very similar in our opinion to what occurred in the

it was applying a de novo standard of review only to the

to you that there was no area of disagreement between

the Ninth Circuit and the trial court which the Ninth

QUESTION*

It is true

Hell, Mr. Barnes, I think the thing

15

that still confuses be is that the regulations, the

16

administrative regulations for determining who is a

17

seaman, require or sat forth a test, that the work of a

18

seaman is work in aid oc navigation, in aid of

19

navi gation.

20

And as I understood it, the Ninth Circuit

21

thought the district court never addressed that, never

22

addressed the test set out in

23

regulations, because the trial court based its finding

24

just on, well, this is maritime, but it never said

whether the work was in aid of navigation or how it

And when you trace back that language to its

QUESTION*

7

Mr. Barnes,

there's a lot of

8

argument between the two of you as to whether these were

9

pure findings of fact or ware something more than that.

10

If they were something more than that and de novo review

11

was proper# do you lose your case?
MR. BARNES;

12

If tha Ninth Circuit feels that

13

there is an element of legal interpretation in those

14

facts, I don't say we lose oar case# because the remedy

15

is a remand to sort out that which is legal from that

16

which is factual.
When someone says, I find the person is a

18

seaman,

19

and it gets more and more concrete — I find that he

does the work of a Coast Guard licensed engineer, there

is of course a range of

QUESTION*

Well, I would hope not, although I

2

must confess in reading the briefs it almost seems that

3

way as between the two of you.

4

over whether these are pure findings of fact.

5

MR. BARNES*

There is so mu-u made

Well, the reason we make much of

6

that is that when one reviews the trial record, and

7

keeping in mind this was a trial before a judge who

8

heard the evidence and the testimony and concluded that

9

these are the facts, we think that’s very significant,

10

because the Ninth Circuit did not address those findings

11

and say that, we disagree with them because they're

12

clearly erroneous.

And that’s why we make much of it.

As we look at the record before you , at the

13
14

very least this case could be decided either way on the

15

record that’s before you, at ihe very least.

16

that’s so, if there is room to interpret the evidence

17

that the trial court heard two ways, then, as you’ve

18

recently recognized in the An ierson case, is is not the

19

Ninth Circuit’s job, it’s not the Ninth Circuit's job to

substitute its interpretation for that of the trial

doesn't quite say this — with respect to the five

3

subsidiary, clearly factual inquiries, the district

court was absolutely right, and then they said,

nevertheless we don't think that this person — these

people were seamen, because this doesn't establish their

work was in aid of navigation.

Supposing they had said

and I know their opinion

8

Would that hive been permissible?

9

MS. BARNES:

That would have been in incorrect

10

legal standard.

They would have applied the wrong rule

of law, and we would have sought review for a different

reason.
QUESTION;

13

I see.

But is it your view that on

14

the ultimate -- I'm still not quite clear -- on the

15

ultimate determination of whether they're seamen or not,

16

that that has to be viewed under the clearly erroneous

17

standa rd ?

18

MR. BARNES*

I will go that far,

yes.

The

19

ultimate determination of seaman, when the issue has to

20

do with what the duties of the workers were, not with

21

how do you interpret the term.

22

I'm trying to draw, and what I'm trying to suggest is an

23

approach to analyzing it that goes this way.
