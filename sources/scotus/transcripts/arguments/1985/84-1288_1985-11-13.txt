ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JONES*

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

members of the Court, may it please the Court, I am here

10

today to ask the Court’s assistance in restoring a

11

valuable bargaining procedure for both plaintiffs and

12

defendants, a procedure which has been effectively

13

denied to civil rights litigants in the Ninth Circuit by

14

the lower court's decision.
That is the ability

15

to negotiate attorneys*

fees along with all other elements of

settlement which gave them, as the Ninth Circuit put it,

2

"more than the District Court during earlier settlement

hearings had indicated it was willing to grant."

4

However,

5

chip, the respondent's attorney appealed the fee waiver

6

and the denial without binding or even looking for an

7

abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge, the

8

Court of Appeals peremptorily struck the fee waiver from

9

the settlement agreement, and in the process imposed a

rule which virtually banned simultaneous negotiations of

Further, the entire decision was based on a faulty

2

premise that special settlement rules apply to civil

3

rights fee shifting cases.

4

This Court recently ruled in derrick v. Chesny

5

that no such special settlement rules exist, and

6

therefore the lower court ruling must be reversed.

7

type of case presents a unique situation, because both

8

sides are generally interested in improving conditions

9

for the plaintiff class.

10

This

That is the primary reason why the Idaho

11

Department of Health and Welfare agreed to provide more

12

relief than the trial judge had indicated that he was

13

going to grant, but this willingness to provide

14

additional relief was expressly conditioned on a waiver

15

of attorneys' fees.

16

QUESTION;

General Jones, do you read the

17

Ninth Circuit's opinion as being limited to class action

18

situations where Rule 21 would apply?

19

KR. JCNFS;

Justice Eehnquist, I read it as

20

being applicable to all situations, not only class

21

action cases but all situations.

22

QUESTION;

What is the authority of the

23

District Court to supervise the settlement cf something

24

that isn't a class action?

MR. JONES*

I wouldn't think so, Your Honor.

I think the only place where the District Judge really

has any place in looking into a situation is where there

is totally unethical conduct.

QUESTION;

General Jones, in the class action

you could ethically have offered the respondents

complete relief on the merits of all their claims?

8

that wasn't what happened here, but if you had offered

complete relief on all their claims conditioned on a

Justice C'Conncr, I think it

13

certainly would have been ethical.

I think we could

14

have offered them less than they were entitled to and a

15

waiver of fees.

16

There is no rule that protects them from going to court

17

and trying their case in front of a court, and as the

18

amicus for thr

19

of New York raid they were confronted with a situation

20

where the City of New York sprung a fee waiver request

QUESTION;

What the

Does it alter the ethical

11

considerations at all in the propriety of making an

12

offer of settlement?

13

MR. JCNES:

As between the parties,

I don't

14

see that it alters the ethical arrangements at all.

15

think the biggest part of the problem that you have in

16

these cases is the ethical considerations between the

17

plaintiffs and the plaintiffs* attorneys, but again,

18

that is something that has to be resolve! between thjm

19

20

considerations.

Mr. Attorney General, you said

Sell, Your Honor, I think that

7

there has to be an inquiry to make sure in the

settlement conference that the plaintiff class is not

being put upon, that is, this is not some kind of a

sweetheart deal, that they are being shortchanged on

that they have for miking payment of the fee sc long as

then, the

14

idea that the trial judge who is supervising the whole

situation can appropriately inquire into the fee?

don’t question that then?

17

MR. JCNESi

No, I don’t question that.

You

I am

saying that he can look into the fee, and he can look

into the arrangements so far as they impinge cn the

any need to do so .

The rule is in conflict with this Court's

soul-searching for plaintiff's counsel, but litigation

15

in general has its share of problems, scul-searching,

problems, yet this Court in Merrick held that

all?

g

MR. JONES*

Certainly, Your Honor, the whole

10

underpinnings of the Court’s decision was that there was

11

some special rule that applied in civil rights cases

12

which allowed the judge to enter an order that says,

13

well, you don’t negotiate the fee portion along with the

14

merits portion.

15

legislative intent gives us the ability to require

16

bifurcated negotiations, and the Merrick case makes

17

clear that that is not the case.

18

The Court specifically said that the

Another ground for reversal is that the rule

19

adopted below is an unreasonble deterrent to settlement,

and contrary to the strong public policy in favor of out

negotiations place the defendants in a quandary.

more money if it is 2X, he may turn it down.

1

in a settlement of a civil rights case

2

provide, but we have assumed that the contention on the

3

other side is based on the proposition that in light of

4

the policies behind Section 1988 that statute should be

5

interpreted as imposing a limitation on the ability to

6

waive or compromise fees, because otherwise, as Justice

7

Rehnquist has suggested in his questioning, it is

8

difficult to see any other basis on which there can be a

9

rejection by the Court of a settlement the parties have

It did not so

10

agreed to any mere than they would have been required to

11

litigate in the first place.

12

Now,

settlement efforts usually involve the

.3

art of compromise, and we recognize that in the context

14

of fee award statutes, settlement negotiations can

15

present ethical diff .culties for the plaintiff’s

16

counsel, not the least of which is the danger that

17

relief for the client’s substantive claims might be

18

sacrificed in favor of the fee award, and our starting

19

point in this case is that it should not be assumed that

20

Congress resolved this problem, or that the Court should

21

resolve it by automatically placing the fee award in the

22

favored status in which it would be removed altogether

23

from the settlement negotiations, and the plaintiff’s

24

counsel would have nothing left to discuss compromise

25

about except the plaintiff’s substantive claims.
19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

That is resolving the ethical dilemma by

1

2

elevating the attorneys* fee award to a favored status,

3

and in the absence of direction by Congress that it

4

intended to do that, we believe that that isn't the

5

proper resolution to be assumed.

6

And another important perspective in this case

7

begins with the Court’s recognition last term in Herrick

8

against Chesny

9

the defendants were unable to make offers that would

that settlements would be discouraged if

10

extinguish their total liability, including their

11

liability for fees, which can be a very sizeable

12

ingredient.
QUESTION*

13

Rule 68 pushes the ethical problem

14

to the extent that there is one right onto the plaintiff

15

and his lawyers, does it not?
MR. WALLACE;

16

That is our position, Mr. Chief

18

discussions, the defendant’s counsel's ethical

19

obligations, and there is more than one counsel’s

20

ethical obligations to consider here, the defendant's

21

22

negotiations to try to minimize his client’s liability

23

in whatever way he can.

24
25

Now, ordinarily, in

these settlement

And what we caution against is open-ended
ambiguity about the extent to which and the
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

circumstances in which the defendant's counsel must

2

compromise that duty to minimize his client's obligation

3

in favor of other concerns, because that kind of

4

ambiguity would seriously threaten the viability of the

5

settlement process itself, and would lead tc relatively

6

routine efforts to invite judicial second guessing of

7

the fairness of the settlement terms.
In our experience,

8

that kind of second

9

guessing really requires an inquiry which approaches a

10

trial on the merits, and if you are going tc have that

11

kind of second guessing, there isn't much point in

12

trying to settle the case in the first place.
QUESTION*

13

Mr. Wallace, do you suggest that

14

Pule 23 in class actions offers no source of authority

15

for tie Court tc make any inquiry under any

16

circumstances and to the appropriateness of the fee

17

waiver proposal in the settlement?

18

ME. WALLACE*
We don't think

We don't go that far, Your

19

Honor.

that the arguments in this case

20

are limited to class actions for the most part, but we

21

do think that while Rule 23 is primarily concerned with

22

protecting the members of tha class, one possible source

23

of concern is whether in the long run the members of the

24

class would be deprived of opportunities to have their

25

claims presented, an!

if you had a situation where there
2 1

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

was a vindictive effort to discourage counsel from

2

representing the members of the class by giving them an

3

offer that they can't refuse contingent on waiver of

4

fees just to teach counsel that they had better not

5

bring such cases, for example —

6

QUESTION!

Do you think the circumstances in

7

this case would be sufficient to at least enable the

8

District Court to look at it where it is made on the eve

9

of trial, and only injunctive relief was sought, and the

10

relief granted

11

that enough to permit the District Court under Rule 23

12

to look at it anyway at the request of the attorneys on

13

the other side?

14

was substantial in the settlement.

MR. WALLACE*

Well,

I hate to say no.

Is

To look

15

at it in the sense that if an allegation was properly

16

made that came within the standard this Court adopted in

17

Franks against Delaware, an allegation that there was

18

something really improper here in this offe., after all,

19

the plaintiffs were not required to accept the offer.

20

The fact that it was the eve of trial meant that they

21

presumably were ready to go to trial, and a settlement

22

negotiation -- our main point is that the Court really

23

should minimize the extent of judicial cabining or

24

intrusion or second guessing of settlement negotiations,

25

because it becomes a long ani unedifying inquiry into
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

who said what tc whom when, and after all, the

2

settlement is something that both sides agreed to and

3

were no,. forced to agree to.

4

Now,

there are categories of cases where the

5

choices are less difficult than they are in this kind of

6

a class action seeking only injunctive relief where

7

there won't be any monetary award to divide between

8

counsel and his clients as they see fit where the

9

clients aren't someone who can afford to pay the cost

10

themselves, as would often be the case if you had a

11

promotion case or something else seeking injunctive

12

relief.

13

this particular case because there is really no guardian

14

of the clients separate from this lawyer who is

15

representing them.

16

is no client for him to discuss it with.

And the situation is aggravated a little bit in

He himself is the guardian — there

17

That, of course, is not the defendant's fault,

18

and I do.i.'t mean to criticize plaintiff's counsel for an

19

admirable job here.

20

partly of his own making in the way he chose to handle

21

this case, but even so, a judgment has to he made on

22

whether to accept a settlement offer in light cf what he

23

perceives to be the strength of the case and the

24

client's overall best interest net only in the relief

25

sought in this case, but in the possibility that future

Nr. Wallace, before you sit down,

counsel for the respondent contends there is only one

8

before this Court.

they are defending a judgment which addressed it on the

simultaneous negotiation be permissible.

QUESTIONS

Idaho’s settlement offer made just seven days before

15

they had asked for but demanded that they waive all

for plaintiff's counsel and contravened the very purpose

of the Civil Lights Act with respect to fees of 1975,

MR. C CL EMAN:

I think you can't read Rule 68,

10

which says that after two and a half years of litigation

11

in a case where the plaintiffs resisted a motion for

12

summary judgment, where they had all this discovery,

13

where they wrote a pretrial conference memorandum, and

14

the plaintiff's lawyer comes into court on March 22nd

15

ready to try the case, and at that point the state says,

16

I will give you everything you want, namely, these

17

children who in 1980 when this suit started were placed

18

in facilities with adults, many of whom had been charged

19

with sexually molesting children.

21

the state didn't even have a child psychiatrist.

22

11

the federal district judge has the responsibility of

setting a reasonable fee.

So the fact that the plaintiff

signed the settlement on his fee should not bar the

judge from setting another fee.

goes to a frivolous claim.

Well,

the case that came out of

10

the Second Circuit which held that you could get counsel

fees even though the case was settled says that you have

12

the right to counsel fees, and I think that it is

13

something the judge would look at.

14

saying, Your Honor, if you file the lawsuit and the day

15

after you file there is a settlement, that obviously

16

that is different from a case where you have a two and a

17

half year litigation.

18

this Court has made it clear that in each case the judge

19

has the responsibility of looking, and we say here he

20

has the responsibility because of the Act of 1976, he

21

had the responsibility because this was a Rule 23

22

proceeding, and he had the responsibility because

23

Paragraph 25 said that it was subject to his approval,
