may I ask whether it makes any difference in

We think it really makes nc

difference, because we think that the decisions of this

Sherbart and Verner and Thomas and

Review Board — that government may not condition

3

benefits, for example, such as unemployment compensation

4

benefits, on an unconstitutional condition such as

5

deprivation of religious rights.
The same thing, *e submit, holds true if in

6
7

fact somebody enters knowing that there is such a

8

regulation.

9

frankly, Justice O'Connor, of a decision by this Court

Of course, the practical impact, quite

10

saying that the military may apply such a regulation

11

constitutianally nauli be that it would in the future bar

12

conscientious believers, who would feel that they could

13

not go day to day without covering their heads, from

14

joining the Air Force.
We think that's really an additional factor as

15
16

to why this Court ought not to permit the absolute rule

17

that the military services are arguing for in this case.
QUESTIONS

Well, Mr. Lewin, you refer to

22

military has been involved, have we?

But those were cases from civil life.

MR. LEWINi

Yes, Your Honor.

We've

That's absolutely

24

true.

They were cases from civilian life and the — what

25

makes this case certainly more difficult, and the

the wearing of a yarmulke even in courts or

Military life is different.

However, this

7

Court has said time and again that the protections of the

8

Bill of Rights apply in the military, and our view, quite

9

frankly, is that in this case the military has gone far

10

beyond what this Court has even tolerated in those

11

situations where, foe example in the parallel area of

12

speech, the Court has upheld military regulations.

13

Just to proceed immediately to that point,

14

Justice Rehnquist, Brown and Glines is a case which the

15

Solicitor General relies on very heavily, but of course

16

Brown and Glines which was,

17

of speech cases where the Court sustained a system of

18

prior restraint in the area of speech as applied

19

military, was a case in which a regulation said that

20

material could be prohibited from a military base if it

21

presented, quote, "a clear danger to the loyalty,

22

discipline or morale of members of the Armed Forces, or

23

material interference with the accomplishment of a

military mission."

3

possibility of some disruption, not the fact that there

4

might be some interference, but a clear danger to factors

5

such as morale and discipline.

Clear danger, not simply the

This case doesn’t concern a regulation in which

6
7

the military services are saying any deviation from the

8

dress code that in the view of a commander presents a

9

clear danger

to morale, discipline, may be prohibited.

10

This is a case where the military has simply said,

11

absolutely, unequivocally, we will permit net the

12

slightest departure whether it presents a danger or not,

13

from the uress code.
QUESTION;

14

But the military has also said -- at

15

least there is testimony — that ary departure is in

16

itself a defeat of the military objective which is

17

uniformity of dress.

18

MB. LEWIN*

It's true.

It is some departure if

19

one assumes that any departure is a clear danger.

20

we are saying —
QUESTION;

21

What

is that the purpose of uniforms is to make everybody look

MR. LEWIS

Agreed, Justice Rehnquist

The

question is whether a departure in and of itself
suffices, or whathar the fact that something is a
departure suffices to overcome the religious protection
that's afforded by the Free Exercise Clause.
And, our position is precisely that just as
this Court has said,

that departures are not enough,

merely departures or disruptions are not enough in the
area of speech, departures if they don't — are not so
extreme as to present that kind of a danger, cannot be
sufficient merely because the military says so.
Because, if one relies on what the military
says, then, we submit, essentially this Court is saying
what it has rejected time and again which is that by
entering upon military service someone doffs the
protection of the First Amendment.
QUESTION*

Where in the military context have

we said, as you intimate we have said, .that departures
are not enough?
MR. LEWIN*

Well, I think by the emphasis on

clear danger or —
QUESTION*

I think you are just drawing a

negative inference from languages, where the holdings
would be against you.

(202) 628-9300

1

statements that have been made that say that the

2

Constitution does protect individuals in the military

3

service would itself be undermined if in fact the

4

military could simply by saying so and expressing its

5

expert opinion say that variations undermine morale.

6

would mean that the military — a commander could just as

7

well say prayer is prohibited, private prayer, because

8

that would undermine morale, because people should only

9

obey commanding officers and not pray.

10

It would mean the military --

11

QUESTION*

12

It

It wouldn’t mean — the military has

never taken that sort of a position.
MR. LEWINs

13

We’re fortunate that they haven’t.

14

I’m quite astoundel. Justice Rehrquist, that they have

15

taken the position that such smal 1 departures as a

16

yarroulke on the top of one’s head or even a kum-kum as

17

cited in the brief that they refer to, the dot that a

18

Hindu might wear, very small derartures from the uniform,

19

or for that matter, the appendi i to the government's

20

brief.

21

The government has taken various liberties, I

22

must say, with the record in this case and just put

23

before this Court a host of material which they did not

24

see fit at all to subject to cross examination and trial

25

in this case.

One of the extraordinary things is a

2

General's brief about what they -- at that time was 53

members of a Pentecostal church.

4

speaking to the pastor after I sa w a copy of the letter,

5

over 100 members of a Pentecostal church, who were

court-martialed or discharged from the Army because they

refused to roll up their sleeves, as a matter of piety.

I'm told now, by

Now, it seems to me again. Your Fonor, that
although it is true, the military can say that every

10

order requires obedience irrespective of what a civilian

11

court may say, or what civilian personnel might say, we

12

submit that that's not what the free exercise clause is

13

about.

14

QUESTION;

Well, Nr. Lewin, you pressed the

15

point several times that the Constitution follows a

16

person into the military, but not just the way it does

for all civilians, of course.

there is — someone had tabulated 387 different religious

sects extant in the state of California.

18

HR. LEWIS;

Well, must they -No, I think very possibly _n that

19

case the military would not hive to accomodate, because

20

it — well, the difference is that where the military is

21

required to create a whole new uniform for somebody --

22

QUESTION;

Just different buttons.

23

MR. LEWINs

Or different buttons.

If he's able

24

to provide his own buttons, maybe that should be a

25

permissible means.

If he's asking the military to

(202) 628-9300

provide buttons for him, I think that may oast a burden
which a yarmulke does not.
One of the things about the religious
observance in this case is, it imposes no burden upon
anyone.

It is a small head covering that someone wears.

Judge Starr in dissenting below noted that it is
equivalent to prayer.

That's really all that it is.

It's a constant symbol of devotion that somebody is
wearing that imposes no burden on any other person
whatever.

Yas, Your Honor.

I think

21

distinctions are possible under a standard that says that

22

where there would be a clear danger in terms of morale or

23

discipline, it seems to me it’s possible.

24
25

The Solicitor General keeps talking about how
the standard can’t be expressed, and yet the Air Force

QUESTION;

5

6

The dress coda does not prohibit

military personnel from wearing rings?

7

MR. LEWIN;

That’s right.

It does not prohibit

8

wearing not more — there’s a maximum number, not more

9

than threa rings.

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. LEWIN;

How about crosses around the neck?
I think if thay’re obvious, if

12

they’re open, very large, then I think it might very well

13

fall into the araa of prohibited ornamentation, but

14

bracelets are permitted, identification bracelets if

15

they’re neat and conservative.

16

QUESTIONS

17

May I interrupt?

What is the

difference between a cross around the neck and a

I don’t know whether

MR. LEWIN;

No, I’m not suggesting that there

be a constitutional difference.

I think —
QUESTION*

3

If there were —

Let me ask you this.

could the

4

military constitutionally prohibit a person from wearing

5

a cross that was rather plainly visible around the neck?

6

MR. LEWIYi

If it's a matter of religious

7

obligation. Your Honor, I think that the military, unless

8

it could find that it in some way interferes with the

9

morale or discipline, could not.
A very plain, conservative cross that is

10
11

religiously required, or an emblem that somebody believes

12

is religiously mandated, at all times, I think that’s -QUESTION!

You mean one that hung down over

18

it requires only that it

then

1

MR. LEWIN;

Well,

but what that does is# it

2

distinguishes in terns of faiths between those where

3

there may be a requirement that it be worn — that the

4

particular article has to necessarily be seen.
QUESTION;

5

But that isn’t the basis for the

6

government's distinction/ as I understand it.

7

is that if it's invisible it doesn't alter your outward

8

dress and that’s all the government is concerned

9

your outward dress.

10

MR. LEWIN;

The basis

with, is

Well, let me say that first of all,

11

until the trial in this case, that wasn't true either.

12

At the trial in this case it developed that there were

13

Mormom undergarments that were being worn in violation

14

then of the regulations.

15

regulations to permit non-visible objects to be worn.

16

QUESTION;

21

But that distinction is based on the

22

appearance of uniformity, which may make very rationa-l

sense.

4

Well, in the military it may well

Certainly we've never said no.
MR. LEWIN:

Well,

I think what this Court has

5

said is that even in the military, that one has to apply

6

the least restrictive alternative.

7

the opinion said, "Like the Army regulation that we

8

upheld in Spock, the Air Force regulations restrict

9

speech no more than is reasonably necessary to protect

10

the substantial government interest."
So, again one has to look to the least

11

12

restrictive alternative.

language taken from the case that refers to whether there

2

is i clear danger to military effectiveness?

3

US. OBERLYi

That's the Brown case.

That weald

4

be — I find all of the tests somewhat unhelpful, but

5

that would be one test that we would use.

6

rephrasing the same test would be to say that the

7

government's burden is to show a substantial governmental

8

interest, which is not necessarily the same thing as a

9

compelling governmental interest as used in Thomas, and

Another way of

10

to show that the means chosen to achieve that substantial

11

governmental interest are reasonably related to --

12

QUESTION:

Well, if the Court were to use the

13

test of whether it’s a clear danger to military

14

effectiveness as applied to the wearincr of the yarmulke

15

indoors in the manner which Captain Goldman did for four

16

years without objection, what is the danger to military

17

effectiveness in his case?

18

MS. OBERLYw

I must say th; t although the

19

"clear danger” words appear

20

not in fact what the Court did.

21

sanction the prior restraint on speech and petitions to

22

Congressmen, saying that a military commander need not

23

await the actual outbreak of disruption and a threat to

24

order, discipline and loyalty among his troops before he

25

can act to avert that disruption.

in thosf opinions, that is

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

That is inconsistent with saying that he can

only act when there's a clear danger.

requiring the actual occurrence of a present danger, of a

clear danger.

9

QUESTIONS

In other words, by

Well, you haven't answered my

question.
MS. OBERLYs

What I'm saying is that I think

10

that our position here is fully consistent with what the

11

Court did in the Sreer and Brown cases, by saying that

12

military changes don't have to wait for the actual

13

occurrence of the clear danger, and that here in this

14

case what's analogous to the presumed clear danger in the

15

free speech cases is the military judgment that

16

exceptions to the uniform requirement will undermine the

17

military purposes of training, discipline, morale, esprit

18

de corp ,, things that the military --

19

20
21

QUESTION*

In every instance regardless of the

particular duty assignment or location and so forth?
MS. OBERLY:

Yes., Your Honor.

The Court has

22

said in Brown itself, and also more recently in Chappell

23

versus Wallace, that the military does not need to have

24

and in effect can't practically have different rules for

25

combat in peacetime and ashore and on base, the same set
37

(202) 628-9300

1

of rules, the same criminal justice system

2

requirements apply at all stages to every service member.

3

same uniform

The reason is that the job of the peacetime

4

military, no matter where they’re stationed, no matter

5

what their duty assignment is, is to be ready to fight a

6

war, to defend this country should they be called upon to

7

do so, and therefore it’s essential that they be equally

8

well trained and indoctrinated from the moment that they

9

join the military as it is —

10

QUESTION;

Well, all right.

So, how does the

11

wearing of the yarmulke by Captain Goldman in the

hospital affect this?

are not saying that Captain Goldman alone wou d

16

necessarily be a threat to the national security if he is

17

allowed to wear his yarmulke.

18

We

That is not our position.

Our position, however, is that deviations as a

19

class from the uniform requirement interfere with the

20

military purposes I've identified, by preventing the

21

assimilation of an incredibly diverse group of civilians

22

who come into the military from widely varying

23

backgrounds,

24

instinctive obedience to command, who in fact come in

25

with perhaps the opposite notion, and who from the day

who do not come in with the notion of

However, it might

I’i like to point out, as Hr. Lewin mentioned

3

at the end, that we, the government discussed in its

4

brief at some length a study that was done by the Defense

5

Department for Congress on the whole subject of whether

and to what extent the military services could accomodate

7

religious practices.

8

study as something that the military offered up instead

9

of more rigorous requirements to be imposed on the

10
11

Mr. Lewin seems to denigrate the

military.
In fact, the House had passed a bill that would

12

have required as a on e-year experiment that yarmuIkes or

13

religious headgear be permitted, and the Senate did not

14

pass that bill.

15

committee was tie requirement that the Defense Department

16

do this study addressing yarmulkes and all other issues

17

of religious accomoiation, ani report back to Congress at

18

the end of the study with recommendations as to what

19

accomodations jere feasible and what accomodations were

20

not feasible.

Instead, the result in conference

21

The study group reported back that they could

22

and would, and they in fact have made accomodations to,

23

in certain instances that are deemed consistent with

24

military necessity,

25

it is now Defense Department policy to allow the wearing

so that taking yarmulkes for example,

of religious garb, whether it’s a yarmulke or something

2

else, in personal living quarters occupied by soldiers

3

but not in offices or in aceas where military business is

4

being conducted., and the study group that did the study

5

for Congress determined that greater accomodation would

6

interfere with the military mission.

7

What's significant about that to us is that it

8

shows the political process and the congressional — or

9

constitutionally committed congressional oversight of the

10

military, working the way it's supposed to.

11

has the Defense Department's report.

12

If it turns out that Congress makes a mistake

and orders the military to make changes in its uniform

20

If, on tue other hand, this Court

constitutionalizes mandatory exceptions to the uniform

is the political process of civilian — of legislative

exactly as it's suppose! to, an! that we would ask the

5

Court to leave the situation where it is and leave it to

So that, the Congress is looking — various

11

simply to say that if this Court affirms what the Court

below did, then everything is being put in a neutral

Congress will ta<e that as an approval of what

actual experience, which is Captain Goldman's actual
