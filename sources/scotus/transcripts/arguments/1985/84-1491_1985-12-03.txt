That's why we have the rule for a public figure that

QUESTION*

Ur. Marion, here we have a private

14

figure case, and as I understand it, the defamatory

15

statement was ccuched in very bread, general terms,

16

something to the effect that federal investigators have

17

found connections between Thrifty and underworld

18

figures, something about that broad.

19

MR. MARION;

20

QUESTION*

That -Now, Pennsylvania has a shield law,

21

as I understand it, so that the plaintiff, the private

22

figure plaintiff here would be unable to in the course

23

of deposition and discovery find out the source of those

24

broad allegations.

25

proposition in a case like this, doesn't it?

That makes it a pretty tough

Well, what if the allegation were

10

as broad as I read to you, and in a jurisdiction where

11

there is a shield law?

12

to disprove?

13

NR. MARION;

Now, how is the plaintiff going

Very simple. Your Honor.

Even

14

assuming that the allegation was broad, let's say the

15

allegation was so broad as simply to say the plaintiff

16

had connections with organized crime, and we're not gong

17

to tell you how we know, it seems to me, Your Honor,

18

that in that case, just as in this case, in the court

19

below, the plaintiff always knows whether or not there

20

are connections with organized crime.

21

take the stand and testify, as this plaintiff did,

22

no connection with organized crime.

23

lawyer can ask him a series of questions, how did you

24

conduct your business, did you conduct it lawfully, and

25

sc forth.

The plaintiff can

the defendant because if the defendant sits silent after

the plaintiff comes and says what the facts are, the

defendant runs a very real risk if not of defaulting on

QUESTION*

MARIONs

Certainly.
It seems to me this cuts in the

21

other direction because if the allegedly defamatory

22

statement is that Thrifty has connections with organized

23

crime, and the issue is whether -- say there is no doubt

24

about the persons with whom Thrifty had connections.

25

had connections with Mr. A, Mr. B, and Mr. C,

and the

justified that comment?

2

MR. MARION;

Well, in this case there was a

3

Pennsylvania Crime Commission in existence which spends

4

its entire existence studying orcranized crime and issues

5

a report every year.

6

this wasn't disputed at all below --

7

That report -- and by the way,

QUESTION:

No, but I'm suggesting that that

8

kind of information is more apt to be available to the

9

newspaper than it is to the individual who may or may

10

not read all this stuff .

11

MR. MARION;

Well,

with discovery -- with

12

discovery it is equally available to both sides, and it

13

was in this case, and

14

saying I know of no connections, you knew,

15

A, B, and C,

16

people.

17

that shifts the burden of production to the defendant,

18

and in this case the defendant did come forward and say

19

precisely what the connections were; it's all in the

20

record; and why they ware said to have the connections.

21

the plaintiff, by the plaintiff

they're honest people, they’re good

I know of no connections to organized crime,

QUESTION;

But all that seems to be persuasive

22

to me of the point that you're perfectly able to

23

discharge this burden of proof if it's placed on you.

24

don't see how that goes to the question of how the

25

burden of proof shall be allocated.

wouldn't it be rational for the law to say that the

But it took a long time for the

Supreme Court to make the flat statement, didn't it?

3

MR. SORKINi

Yes, sir, it hadn't come up,

4

quite frankly.

5

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in -- during the 1970s in

6

two other cases has relied upon this Pennsylvania

7

constitutional provision for certain explicit reasons.

8

One is n a case called Moyer v. Phillips, a 1975 case,

9

the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rules that the ricrht of

10

defamation, to claim a cause of action of defamation,

11

must survive the death of either the plaintiff or the

12

defendant because the cause of action of defamation is

13

protected by the Pennsylvania Constitution and stands on

14

the same basis with other causes of action.

15

There was another case in 1978 where the

16

Pennsylvania Supreme Court was ruling on an issue where

17

somebody was illegally committed to a mental

18

institution, and when that person was found that the

19

commitment was illegal, and then that person petitioned

20

to have the records of his commitment destroyed, and the

21

court held that because the right of reputation is so

22

important, the court would order destruction of those

23

record s.

2

So the question I think that we have to face

3

here is whether the rule of Gertz, which says that the

4

states may not impose liability without fault, also

5

means that the private plaintiff must, in addition to

6

proving fault,

7

that is an unequivocal no.

8
9

prove falsity,

and I think the answer to

Falsity can be proved without resort to proof
of fault, and fault can be proved without resort to

10

evidence of falsity.

Marion gave the example that I have in my brief of what

MR. SURKIHs

I believe that that's a possible

this case, that in those states that do have shield

laws, it would be unconstitutional and an improper
