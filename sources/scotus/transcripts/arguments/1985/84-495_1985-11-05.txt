Mr. Gordon,

just as a matter of

curiosity, is Governor Thornburgh still a party to this

litigation?
MR. GORDON;

8
9

The parties did agree that he

should be removed, bat the District Court never entered

10

an order on that, so technically I believe he still is a

11

party, but he will be removed as soon as it is returned

12

to the District Court and the District Court issues an

13

order.

posture with a high official of Pennsylvania as the lead

Even though the parties have agreed

that he should go out.
HR. GORDON:

3

Yes.

It is our understanding

until the Court issues an order dismissing him that he

is still a party.

6

Now, before reaching the questions presented

7

to the Court this morning, I would like to sketch very

8

briefly the procedural history of the case,

9

relevant to the issues before the Court.

which is

The statute was passed in June of 1982, and it

10

11

was not until October that this lawsuit was filed.

12

About one month later, the plaintiffs filed a motion for

13

preliminary injunction, and they attached tc this motion

14

40 detailed affidavits.
On November 18th of

15

1982, the District Court

16

issued a procedural order to govern the hearing on the

17

motion for preliminary injunction, and as a part of this

18

order, the District Court directed the parties to agree

19

on stipulations, and also prohibited any party from

20

contesting any fact at the hearing unless that party had

21

positive evidence to offer in support of that particular

22

f act.

23

So, stipulations were agreed upon, but they

24

were agreed upon solely for the purposes of the

25

preliminary injunction hearing, and they were largely

The District Court with ons minor exception

denied the preliminary injunction, and after lengthy

consideration,

the Court of Appeals struck down numerous

that to he appealable a decision of a court of appeals

You mean

Twelve fifty-four two, that's

In fact -QUESTION;

In other words, because Congress

21

didn’t say final judgment expressly, the inference is

22

that Congress intended appealability even when there

23

wasn’t a final judgment?

24
25

MR. GORDON*

I think it certainly permits that

conclusion, but that is not our entire argument.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

We

dcn't base our entire argument on the omission of the

word "final."

3

QUESTION;

Well, to the extent you base your

argument on it at all,

which allows cert, as you know, before or after

rendition of a judgment or decree?

9

NR. GORDON;

what ioes that do with

Wouldn't that be

No, I don't believe so? 1254(2)

applies to a very narrow class of cases.

10

QUESTION;

I am talking about 1254(1).

11

MR. GORDON;

Well, I know, and 1254 ( 1)

12

obviously applies to the broader range of cases.

13

don't think the Court has ever held for cert that there

14

need be a final order.

15

consistent, and in fact the original version of the

16

statute enacted in 1925 from which 1254(1) and

17

are derived were worded similarly and very broadly.

18

Namely, both of those sections, and more particularly

19

the predecessor of 1254(2), provided for an appeal in

20

any case in a Court of Appeals if the decision was

21

against the constitutionality of the state statute.

22

I

I think it is entirely

1254(2)

And certainly the decision under review here

23

satisfies those general requirements.

24

the case was properly in the Court of Appeals, and

QUESTION;

Well, I know, but the guestion is

whether there is a final judgment.
MR. GORDONS

We don *t argue that there is a

final judgment in this case.
QUESTION:

But you say it is nonetheless

appealable under 1254(2).

8

UR. GORDON:

9

QUESTION;

Yes, we do.
I am wondering why you can’t read

10

1254(2) as Congress intending the long time requirement

11

of final judgment obtained here and that 1254 ( 1 ) was

12

simply an exception.

13

HR. GCRDONs

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. GORDON;

Well,

we understand —

Why can’t it be read that way?
Well, the absence of the word

16

"final" permits a reading either way, but it is our

17

position that the general rule of finality does not,

18

cannot, and should not be followed when there are

19

particular policies which are relevant to a specific

20

statute, and which support the conclusion that non-final

21

review should be permitted.

MR. GORDON;

Then we request that the Court
That is cur alternative

10

argument.

11

Congress was concerned about the effect on federal-state

12

relations, which comes about when a federal court

13

strikes down a state statute, and while the power to

14

declare state statutes unconstitutional obviously is

15

necessary if we are to preserve the federalist system,

16

Congress believed that states should be entitled to

17

enforce their laws absent this Court's decision of

18

unconstitutionality.

19

As I was saying, in this particular statute,

This policy --

QUESTION;

Getting back, if I may, since I had

20

to interrupt, now, as I understand it, there are

21

apparently several provisions of this Pennsylvania

22

statute still before the District Court, are there not?

23

HR. GORDON;

24

QUESTION;

25

That’s right.
And as to the five — there are

five here, are there not?

And as to those five, did not the

stipulation of facts expressly reserve the right to make

4

a record in the District Court so that our holdings

5

could be, I gather, changed by subsequent factual

6

developments ?

7

9

MR. GORDON:

That was certainly the intention

at the time when that stipulation was entered into.
QUESTION:

Why should we treat with these

10

important questions now?

11

true final judgment out of the District Court before we

12

address them?

13

MR. GORDON:

Where do we actually get a

Well, the problem is that the

14

Court of Appeals issued a final judgment as to these

15

particular statutes in this case.

16

to interpret their decision other than it being a final

17

declaration as to these provisions that we have brought

18

before the Court this morning that they are

19

unconstitutional,

20

there is nothing that we could prove on remand or should

21

he able to prove on remand that would change that

22

result, so that is the difference.

23

There is no other way

that they cannot be enforced, and that

QUESTION:

Well, would you be satisfied if we

24

simply said the Court of Appeals erred in entering a

25

final judgment cn those issues?

It should have just

said the injunction was not an abuse of discretion?
ME. GORDON;

2
3

that.

4
5

No, we wouldn't be satisfied with

QUESTION;

I wouldn't think you would be.

So

why are you making this argument?

6

(General laughter.)

7

MR. GORDON;

Hell,

let me tell you why.

I

8

don't think that would really get us anywhere for this

9

reason.

Plainly, if the Court of Appeals held that the

10

statutes are unconstitutional, they would have if they

11

applied the proper standard of review at the time found

12

that there was a likelihood of success on the part of

13

the appellees on the merits, and it is our position that

14

that conclusion was plainly incorrect.

15

QUESTION;

So you would have attempted to come

16

here anyway if the Court of Appeals had just said the

17

preliminary injunction was all right?

18
19
20

MR. GORDON;

Well, I am not certain that we

would have.
QUESTION;

Well, if you wouldn't, why should

21

we do anything more than affirm them as to the

22

preliminary injunction?

23

MR. GORDON;

Well,

the difference is this.

24

First of all, that that isn't what they did, and it is

25

clear, I would think, that if that is all this Court
1 1
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

does, then it would be an exercise in futility for us to

2

go back to the Eistrict Court anyhow, because no

3

District Judge is going to be able to look beyond the

4

fact that the Court of Appeals reached the merits, and

5

feels rather strongly,

6

provisions are unconstitutional.

to say the least, that these

7

As I was saying, this policy --

8

QUEST 10Hi

9

hr. Gordon, for which of the

statutes at issue here is there in your view a need for

10

additional factual record before a final adjudication on

11

constitutionality is proper?
MR. GORDON*

12

Let me say that it is cur

13

position based upon the appellee's apparent conception

14

that they have no additional evidence to offer that the

15

Court may reach the merits and uphold these statutes

16

based on this record.

17

position on the merits -QUESTION;

18

If the Court disagrees with our

Well, you take the position then

19

that no additional factual record is necessary for the

20

final decision on any of these statutes and their

21

validity ?

22

MR. GORDON*

We take the position that the

23

Court may uphold these statutes based on this record.

24

However, if the Court concludes that the Court of

25

Appeals properly applied the law to the limited record
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

before it in finding that there were problems with the

2

statute, then we have evidence to offer on most of the

3

provisions.

4

I would say probably the one exception is the

5

second position requirement, where the only contest is

6

whether or not you can read this particular statute as

7

including an exception for an emergency.

8

there is any additional evidence we have to offer on

9

that provision, but on the others, I think there are

I don't think

10

additional justifications by way of facts that we can

11

offer if the Court deems that necessary.
QUESTION;

12

Do you take the position that

13

abstention is appropriate as to any of the statutes to

14

allow the state courts to interpret them?
MR. GORDON;

15

I am not sure that it would be

16

feasible.

17

procedure that we could use to get a ruling on the

18

interpretation cf these statutes, so I am net sure that

19

extension would be a feasible alternative, and frankly,

20

I don't understand absention to be the proper course

21

when the statutes can clearly be interpreted in a

22

constitutional manner, and that certainly is our

23

argument.

24
25

Pennsylvania has no particular certification

QUESTION;

in this case.

At the District Court level?
Yes.
Absolutely.

In fact, it was dene

There was a reservation.

QUESTION*

Well, I am speaking as tc the five

8

provisions before us.

9

understood it that expressly reserved the right to make

10

a record in the District Court as to the five issue you

11

have before us.

12
13
14

You have a stipulation as I

Is that right?

MR. GORDON;

As to those and all of the issues

that were involved, yes.
QUESTION;

Yas, and that reservation may be

15

triggered without regard to what the Court may think by

16

either party to the stipulation?

17

MR. GORDON;

That was certainly our

18

understanding when we entered into it.

19

at this level is that based upon the Court of Appeals

20

decision, the appellees take the position they have

21

nothing additional to offer, so there has been a change

22

since we entered into that stipulation.

23

Now,

The difference

24

point, it is our position that this interest that

25

Congress recognized in the appeals statute is as surely

In fact, the Court has indicated more recently

in the Affrin case and by way of a summary affirmance

need for this type of statute.

woman

16

The Pennsylvania legislature specifically

17

found and the evidence revealed that women, despite

18

existing requirements for informed consent, are not

19

always being provided with relevant information, and it

20

has been reported that some clinics encourage women to

21

undergo abortion by withholding information which might

22

cause them to bear the child to term.

23

The Pennsylvania statute does not put words in

24

the mouth of the counselor or the physician, and it

25

describes only in general terms the information which

It contains no parade of horribles,

no statements of dubious validity, and it gives doctors

21

Under threat of criminal sanction, the

22

Pennsylvania statute requires two things.

First, it

requires the physician to use the standard cf care that

24

he would use as if the fetus were to be born prematurely

25

rather than being aborted, regardless of the

Second, the physician must use the abortion

technique most likely to result in a live born fetus

4

unless that technique would cause a significantly

5

greater medical risk to the woman.

6

Court of Appeals, the significantly greater language on

physician to give his primary allegiance to his patient,

9

that is, the woman, and forces the physician to trade

Now, as found by the

10

off the woman's best medical care in order to only

11

marginally increase the chance of fetal survival.
The Commonwealth concedes that such a tradeoff

12
13

is impermissible, but they ask this Court to delete the

14

word "significantly" in order to cure the constitutional

15

problems.

16

"significantly," this Court would be forced to rewrite

17

the statute, and we do not believe that the Court can dc

18

that.

19

To do that, to delete the word

But the statute, even if the word

20

"significantly" were deleted, contains other problems.

21

It requires doctors to compare risks of differing

22

abortion methods that are impossible to compare.

23

example, a physician could use a prostaglandin method or

24

a saline method on a woman who had diabetes or who had

25

hypertension or combined , which is frequently the case.
28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

For

Each method carries approximately the same

1
2

risk of mortality in a mathematical sense»

The

3

prostaglandin method, however, will increase the risk of

4

stroke, and the saline method would increase the risk of

5

uncontrolled diabetes.
What the doctor is required to do here is to

6
7

compare those two risks, to say is the risk of stroke a

8

significantly greater medical

risk than the risk of

9

uncontrolled diabetes, and it

is that comparison that is

10

impossible to make, especially without consulting his

11

patient as to which risk she is likely or wanting to

The question then becomes as a result of the

impossibibility of the judgment that the doctor is

belief that criminal sanctions are likely to produce one

Your Honor, it is our view that

1

to tell the woman thut the father is liable for support,

2

given the national crisis in the collection of child

3

support enforcement orders that Congress has recognized,

4

and the difficulty in the collecting of support may in

5

many cases be misleading, but in addition to inform

6

that, to use — to provide that information to certain

7

women, such as a rape victim who must be informed that

8

her assailant is liable for the support of her child if

9

she carries the pregnancy to term can be extremely cruel

10

and traumatic in that situation, and may force her to

11

relive that trauma.

12

It is those very situations that that,

13

information may not be appropriate at different times.

14

It is our view that the statute must allow the physician

15

to tailor the information to the specific needs of this

16

patient, and he can't do that, or the counselor can't do

17

that given the mandates of the provision.

18

The statute, as I said, is both cruel and

19

inaccurate in seme situations, and misleading, and also

20

requires the prevision of irrelevant information which

21

can harm the health of the woman in certain instances.

22

Let me give you another example.

23

Informing a woman that there are unforeseeable

24

risks to an abortion is an inaccurate statement given

25

that abortion is the most studied medical procedure in

1

American medicine today/ and can only be intended by the

2

legislature to arouse unwarranted fears of the woman.

3

In addition/ it is irrelevant to provide

4

information such that medical assistance payments are

5

available or information that the state strongly urges

6

the woman to contact particular agencies and consult

7

private social agencies that are run by opponents of

8

abortion in situations where the woman needs the

9

abortion in order to protect her life.

10

In those circumstances not only is it

11

irrelevant, but it could be harmful to the woman's

12

health, and the facts in the record do show that.

13

Accordingly, the informed consent provisions must be

14

held in invalid..

15

In conclusion, the Pennsylvania Act

16

constitutionally infringes on the rights of women in

17

consultation with their physicians to make critical

18

decisions about abortion and to interfere with women's

19

ability to control their own lives and health.

been argued to this Court that the controversy

21

surrounding the abortion issues requires a retreat from

22

the principles both espoused by this Court in

24

this controversy that compels a clear and unwaivering

25

dedication to those sound and fundamental principles.
