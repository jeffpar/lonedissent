ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

HE. GRIBBON*

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

please the Courts
The issue in this appeal is whether a tax on

10

oil and chemicals imposed by

11

finance a spill fund to be used for the cleanup of

12

hazardous wastes is pre-empted by an Act of Congress.

13

New

Jersey in order to

As part of the Comprehensive Environmental

14

Response, Compensation ani Liability Act of 1980,

15

commonly referred to as CERCLA, Congress imposed a tax

16

on oil and chemicals to finance a superfund to start

17

cleaning up hazardous wastes nationwide.

of the federal

1

no need to inquire whether Congress intended pre-emption

2

of state action.

3

Here it is undisputed that Congress has

4

pre-empted some state taxation for cleanup purposes, and

5

the question is whether the New Jersey spill fund

6

escapes that pre-emption.

7

New Jersey statute which was passed in 1977 that the

8

purpose of the spill fund was to clean up hazardous

9

wastes in accordance with the National Contingency Plan.

10

It is clear on the face of a

Three years later, Congress came along and

11

passed CERCLA to accomplish the same cleanup purpose on

12

a nationwide basis.

13

therefore, that a purpose of the spill fund was really

16

that they are eligible for payment under CERCLA.

the interpretation of

114-C, we urge, gives the pre-emption real meaning.

Certainly Congress intended that it was to have some

10
11

real meaning.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Grib bon, I think the Solicitor

12

General in a brief filed with us takes the position that

13

is neither yours nor the appellee's.

14

understand the SG *s position.

15

do you plan to comment on it?

16

MB. GRIBBONs

I'm not sure I

Do you, and would you —

I will comment on it right now,

17

Justice O'Connor.

The Solicitor General rejects New

18

Jersey's view that the pre-emption is limited to claims

19

actually paid.

20

statute is partially pre-empted by the federal statute.

21

He arrives that way by distinguishing between

He goes on to say that the New Jersey

22

claims that New Jersey would pay that are submitted by

23

third parties as against payments made directly by the

24

state, even for the same purpose, and therefore he says

25

that the pre-emption is only to the extent that New
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Jersey honors claims that are submitted to it and it

2

does not cover direct payments made by the state to

3

accomplish exactly the same purpose.

4

And, it is that second part where we disagree

5

with him and feel there is no basis in the statute or in

6

its legislative history for making this arbitrary

7

distinction between claims submitted to New Jersey and

8

work done directly by New Jersey that accomplishes the

9

same purpose.
Actually, the New Jersey statute is very clear

10
11

that everything that it pays is put in terms of claims

12

and compensation, ani similiarly CERCLA recognizes that

13

a state —
QUESTION*

14

I don’t understand that last

statement.

scheme all payments v<ould be made to the state itself,

17

in effect?

18

Are you saying that under the New Jersey

MR. GRIBBCNi

All payments nr de by the state

19

itself are regarded is payment of claims, because there

20

is a New Jersey Environmental Department that submits

21

claims to the Treasurer’s Department and the Treasurer

22

then pays them, so that New Jersey does not recognize

23

this distinction that the Solicitor General purports to

24

see between paying claims for third parties and doing

25

the work yourself.

That really doesn't make any sense.

QUESTION*

Hell, I suppose it*s also possible

2

to argue that what the statute means is pre-empted.

3

it, not only things that could actually be paid by the

4

federal government because it's part of the national

5

priority list, tut sites or damage that are not included

6

in any national priority list would never be paid by the

7

federal government and therefore are not pre-empted?

8

Now,

9

MR. GFIBBONs

Is

what about that?
Your Honor, we would agree with

10

that interpretation.

11

to the extent a claim -- to the extent a response or

12

damage claim does qualify under CERCLA and can be paid,

13

then the state is pre-empted

14

oil and chemicals to pay it.

15

QUESTION*

That’s precisely what we say, that

from resorting to a tax on

But if there is a site in New

16

Jersey that isn’t on the priority list of the federal

17

government and of EPA,

18

could make its —

19

HR. GRIBBONs

then you would think the state

Could tax chemical and oil and

20

make a payment, except for sites that are on the

21

National Contingency Plan, an earlier list where removal

22

without any kind of approval from EPA can be compensated

23

under EPA, and a lot of the expenses of the State of New

24

Jersey are removal expenses.

25

CERCLA distinguishes between remedial and

removal, and there is a broader right to the states in

2

removal.

3

your statement that the State could create a fund by

4

taxing oil and chemicals as long as it was for the

5

purpose of dealing with non-CERCLA qualified matters.
New Hampshire has precisely that kind of a

6
7

statute, and we’ve referred to it in our brief.
QUESTION*

8
9

Essentially, I think I’m in agreement with

Mr. Gribbon, along the line of your

answers, what if the federal government pays claims to

10

the state, perhaps would pay.

What does the state do

11

with the money derived from its taxes where the federal

12

government had paid the claim already?
The state raises taxes, and I understood you

13
14

to say the taxes are raised to pay claims that the

15

federal government under the Superfund Act already will

16

pay.

17

Is that correct?
MR. GRIBBONj

Yes, that is correct.

If they

18

qualify, if they will go to the fede* al government and

19

say, we’ve spent .his money, or this needs to be done

20

and we qualify for payment, yes.

21

QUESTIONS

Well, assume that the claims do

22

qualify for federal payment.

23

windfall with the taxes it has raised?

24
25

MR. GRIBBON*

Does the state have a

Well,

to some extent it does.

It has presently in this spill fund an accumulation of

1

$25 million that it hasn’t spent, and it has spent very

2

heavily — pardon?

3
4
5

QUESTION;

Because the federal government has

paid the claims ?
HR. GRIBBON;

It may be because the federal

6

government has paid 90 percent of the cost of cleaning

7

up sites in New Jersey.

8

Jersey than it has in any other state, and New Jersey

9

has benefited from that and it still keeps in its fund

It has spent more money in New

10

this $25 million that it’s collected from the tax on oil

11

and chemicals.

12

13
14
15

QUESTION;

You said

"maybe."

I suppose the

record just doesn't show?
HR. GRIBBON;

It shows the $25 million

accumulation.

16

QUESTION;

Yes.

17

HR. GRIBBON;

But to say exactly why that’s

18

there, that’s impossible.

19

New Jersey participating heavily.

20

its official report, it’s among the leaders in

21

competition for the national superfund dollars.

22

QUESTION;

It shews these two things.
Indeed, it says in

Mr. Gribbon, while you are

23

interrupted, I’d like to pursue a little further Justice

24

O’Connor’s question about the Solicitor General’s

25

interpretation of the statute in which he says, the word
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

"claims” refers to third party claims against the state.

2

As I understand your response, you are saying,

3

well. New Jersey treats a claim L* its own agency

4

against the state treasury as a claim.

5

necessarily answer the question, what the word "claim"

6

means in the federal statute?
MB. GEIBBONs

7

But, does that

In the federal statute, a state

8

is recognized as an appropriate claimant, something that

9

the Solicitor General overlooked or didn't pay any

10

attention to.

But there isn't any reason why the state

11

can't be a claimant for Superfund monies in accordance

12

with the words of the statute.
QUESTION*

13

It is sort of a strange way to

14

write a statute, though, to talk about claims,

15

compensation for claims, to mean a state compensating

16

itself.

17

MB. GEIBBONs

Well,

the New Jersey statute is

18

written that wa r, ani I

think the :eason for it is that

19

there are these two different departments of the state,

20

the Environmental Department on the one hand which does

21

the work or that contracts it out and the Treasury which

22

holds the money.

23

environmental work, claims and compensation have been

24

used fairly interchangeably with no distinction as to

25

whether the state does the work directly or the federal

Indeed, in the whole area of

10

(202) 628-9300

1

government does the work directly, or pays for having it

2

done.

3

I would just like to say —

4

QUESTION*

Mr. Gribbon, if we agreed with your

5

interpretation cf the statute, would all the money ever

6

collected by New Jersey to put in its Superfund have to

7

be refunded?
MR. GRIBBON*

8

9

We believe it would, Your Honor,

the reason being twofold*

in the first place the

10

pre-emption goes to the purpose of the statute.

11

Jersey never took any steps to change the purpose of its

12

statute after CERCLA was passed.

13

that.

14

New

It could have done

Indeed, the New Jersey statute in *77

15

recognized that there could come along a federal statute

16

that would be pre-emption and it directed that at that

17

time there be a review and ra-examination.

18

took place.

19

That never

Moreover, the non-CERCLA funds that

20

expenditures have been made by New Jersey are quite

21

insignificant, about six percent of the total fund, the

22

record appears to show at least in the earlier years.

23

So, we believe that since — initially, let me concede,

24

New Jersey could have split the fund.

25

It could have decided, we're going to collect
1 1
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

so much for all spills which are not governed by CERCLA

2

and we're going to collect so much for chemicals which

3

are not covered.

4

rate was originally set to cover all kinds of hazardous

5

waste, not just oil spills, and that tax rate has never

6

been changed even though in 1980 the tax would have gone

7

off through a capping provision in the statute if it

8

were not for the hazardous waste claims.

It did not dc that, and indeed the tax

9

Hew Jersey’s experience with oil spills was sc

10

favorable that they would have had enough money, were it

11

not for these hazardous wastes.

13

question while I have you interrupted, please.

15

affecting the Superfund.

no.

21

there.

23

to a broad-based tax of some sort and would take the

24

whole burden as it now rests off oil and chemicals.

All of the bills they are talking about would

the pre-emption would disappear.

2

would no longer be bearing what was recognized as a

3

disproportionate burden of the tax, and the pre-emption

4

would disappear.

5

The oil and chemicals

It's entirely possible, though, that they are

6

not going to arrive at any kind of agreement and the

7

present bill would simply be extended and the

8

pre-emption presumably would continue, although that

9

remains to be seen, if oil and chemicals continue to

10
11

bear the disproportionate burden.
On the words of the statute, and it isn't a

12

big, comprehensive sort of a

13

only this, that the "may be compensated," particularly

14

the "may be," reflects the potential and not the

15

certainty of payment that actually paid, which was not

16

used, which would reflect — and by examining CEPCLA a

17

state legislature can ietermine what kinds of claims

18

qualify for payment and which don't, and if they think

19

the need is there, create another fund even by a tax on

20

oil and chemicals and that, as I say, is exactly what

21

New Hampshire has done.

22

statute, I will emphasize

There are other aspects of section 114, for

23

example, the exemption from pre-emption and a provision

24

against double taxation in 114-B, which we submit fully

25

support our view that looking solely at the statute

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

itself. New Jersey's view strips it of meaning ani

2

doesn't give proper significance to the words that are

3

used in there.

4

Let me turn briefly to the objectives and

5

purposes of CERCLA, which we submit fully support the

6

interpretation of the pre-emption that we urge.

7

was compromise legislation jammed through in the 1980

8

lame duck session with very little in the way of

9

explanation as to just exactly what Congress meant.

10

This

There were, for example, no reports.
Accordingly, one has to look at what was said

11
12

and discussed during about two years of legislative

13

gestation that this bill was going through.

14

in that discussion, I submit, give real content to the

15

pre-emption.

Two strains

The first one is about money, where it was

16
17

going to come from and how much they were going to

18

need.

19

would be enough to make a start on this massive job.

20

They finally decided th'.t a fund of $1 .6 billion

Now, this money could have come from general

21

revenues because all of us in some measure bear some

22

responsibility for hazardous wastes.

23

from a tax on generators.

24

miners, milling people,

25

contribute to this.

It could have come

These are manufacturers,

some 260,000, who directly

14
ALDERSON REPORT mG COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

Nonetheless, it was decided not to do that, to

1

2

impose this tax only on oil and chemicals, some 30

3

chemicals, with the result that about 400 -- about 900

4

taxpayers bore the entire burden of the federal waste

5

program.

6

and concern that those people should not be taxes again

7

for this purpose, at least for the five-year

8

experimental period luring which CERCLA was to be in

9

effect.

10

Thereafter,

there was considerable discussion

So that, the basic consideration there was a

11

recognition that oil and chemicals were bearing a

12

disproportionate burden of the cost of federal waste

13

cleanup, and that at least for this period when the

14

federal program was getting itself going and finding

15

what needed to be done, they shouldn't be subject to

16

multiple state taxation.

17

all 50 states.

18

They could have been taxed in

The other theme that runs through the

19

discussions is the need to provide for federal-state

20

cooperation in order to achieve effectively this

21

nationwide program of dealing with the waste, and this

22

involved the states nominating sites and working with

23

the federal government, and indeed paying ten percent of

24

the total cost.

25

So, it was necessary, and many legislators
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

suggested that this was going to be difficult enough

2

with one federal program without having up to 50 other

3

state programs competing in chis prioritization,

4

competing for human resources and financial resources.
So, those two strains, I submit, fully support

5

6

our contention that what was intended was that the

7

states would not put additional taxes on oil and

8

chemicals for these same purposes, and it didn't have tc

9

do with actual payment but rather with the purpose of

10

the tax.
Now,

11

the New Jersey Supreme Court, in

12

accepting the actually paid argument, relied almost

13

entirely on a single incident in the legislative history

14

of CERCLA, and in a colloquy on the Senate floor.

15

Senator Raidolph, the Floor Leader, did agree in

16

response to two complicated leading questions from

17

Senator Bradley that pre-emption extends only to funds

18

whose pur iose is to pay clai .s actually paid by

19

S upe rf und .

20

I submit that in the first place, any court

21

should be extremely cautious in according very much

22

weight to such an isolated exchange, particularly when

23

it strays so far from the words of the statute.

24

Moreover, it is at least as likely as not, if you look

25

at the context of that statement, that Senator Bradley

4

had in mind pre-existing

These were funds that had collected money

5

before the effective date of CERCLA, and Senator

6

Randolph at great length explained that there was no

7

pre-emption involved there.

8

however they wanted to spend it.

9

deep interest in that because it did have such a fund.

That money could be spent
And, New Jersey had a

It should be noted in this connection that

10
11

earlier in this colloquy both Senator Bradley and

12

Senator Randolph referred to pre-emption as extending tc

13

claims and damages compensable under CERCLA, and

14

"compensable" and "may be asserted" were the terms that

15

were used most frequently throughout the legislative

16

discussion, along with this concern to prevent federal

17

taxation.

18

I think, in answer to Justice O'Connor's

19

question, I have dealt with an argument New Jersey maVes

20

which appears to be that even if our view of the

21

pre-emption is accepted, this spill fund should

22

nonetheless survive.

The other argument that it seems to make is

2

3

that in fact it has refrained from spending money on

certain sites.

5

correct, and I'll show in just a moment that it is not,

6

we submit that- spill funds should still be stricken

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

New Jersey has one of the worst, if not the

because of this problem massive amount of resources are

The New Jersey Legislature responded to the

hazardous substance pollution problem and the threat of

7

oil spills to the state's coast and tourist industry in

8

1977 when it adopted the Spill Compensation and Control

9

Act.

The Spill Act provided strong liability provisions

10

in order to have responsible parties pay for as much of

11

the cleanup as possible, but it also provided a funding

12

source for those cleanups where responsible parties were

not available to finance +-he work.

New Jersey relied almost exclusively on the

21

Is that correct?
MS. JACOBSON:

Belying upon the review of

22

state statutes that Exxon has included in its brief, our

23

statute does seem to be different from other statutes.

24

That may be a timing — there may be a timing issue in

25

there, in that ours was adopted in 1977.

In fact,

many ways it was the model for the federal Superfund Act

2

And, this litigation was brought almost on the

3

very heels of the adoption of the statute, so other

4

states were put on notice, beware, you may run into some

5

litigation if you adopt the same kind of statute New

6

Jersey has.
Interestingly, though, if you look at their

7
8

review the majority of the statutes are financed by some

9

sort of special tax or fee, either on waste generation

10

or licensing or so forth, so that states have relied

11

upon special funds, some sort of dedicated fund, as the

12

way to provide their share of federal — of the federal

13

cleanup program, and also whatever falls outside of the

14

federal cleanup program.

and the state schemes,

Given that federal coverage, what

Actually, quite a lot, if you look at the

state scheme in relation to the federal scheme.

First,

16

in regard to remedial actions, the states are

17

responsible for ten percent of the share of the costs,

18

and perhaps even mor?.
Since that is not eligible for compensation on

19

20

the federal level, that is something that's clearly an

21

appropriate area of state fund expenditure.

22

Bradley-Randolph colloquy and some further legislative

23

history from Congressman Florio in the House debate,

24

support this, although Exxon has never conceded this

25

point.

Both the

Beyond that is the issue of petroleum spills.

2

Exxon has conceded that the state may use its special

3

ta.v to finance the cleanup and removal of petroleum

4

spills and related damage claims.

5

this — or claim that this is a peripheral purpose of

6

the Hew Jersey fund, but if you look at the statute

7

itself and the legislative findings, it's crystal-clear

8

that the state was very concerned about petroleum spills

9

because of our beaches, the tourist industry, and so

forth.
Having a contingency plan available in case

11
12

there is a catastrophic occurrence in regard to

13

petroleum is thus an essential part of the Hew Jersey

14

fund.

15

The New Jersey fund also provided coverage for

16

property damage.

17

possibilty of covering property damage, they decided at

18

the last minute to exclude it from coverage under

19

Superfund, so that's another area that the New Jersey

20

fund may be used for.

21

Although Congress debated the

areas are significant, and are those areas not covered

on the federal level.

appropriately be the subject of a state fund

2

Interestingly, Exxon started out in this case

3

saying that we could use our fund for very few ..a. these

4

purposes.

5

at page 8 they suggest that the only possible use of the

6

state fund is tc pay for prepositioning costs which are

7

mentioned in the second part of Section 114-C.

In fact, even in the jurisdictional statement

8

It was clear from the legislative history,

9

however, that this use, prepositioning and equipment

10

cost, was simply illustrative and not exclusive.
Another area that has been ignored by Exxon

11
12

are the regulations contained in the National

13

Contingency Plan relating to eligibility.

14

regulations provide -- and as they have been interpreted

by EPA,

that what may be compensated by Superfund is to be

;ets right down tc the fact

It is this opportunity to supplement the

24

federal fund in cases where Congress has not been able

25

to cover the area that gave rise to the actual

compensation test that was endorsed by the Sew Jersey

Supreme Court and that we have already discussed.

3

One other important factor is to realize that

4

this pre-emption language came out of the oil spill

5

context where it had a very different effect.

6

oil spill context, when they first debated pre-emption,

7

the Congress was contemplating a program that was much

8

more comprehensive, be it in a limited sphere, than the

Superfund program.

all future spills into navigable waters, and cover all

12

related damages of the kinds that Congress deems could

15

they broadened the coverage in the sense of applying to

Therefore the federal coverage, in a sense,

21

shrank to what they actually could cover and thereby

expanded to what the states would be able tc use a

8

Although New Jersey has not taken legislative

9

action to change its spill fund, one of the reasons for

10

that is that this litigation has been pending for the

11

last four and a half years and in the course of that

12

time the state fund has been administered consistently

13

with the position that we have taken in this litigation,

14

so the fact that the state statute recognized that a

15

federal Act would be adopted, certainly is not at all

16

dipositive of the issue before this Court.

17

When you look at the legislative history of

18

this particular provision, when you look at thr language

19

of the provision which relates the limits on state

taxation to coverage on the federal level -- I mean,

when you look at the purpose of the statute as a whole,

of promoting cleanups in New Jersey and elsewhere,

inconceivable tc us that Congress could have intended tc

The wiping out of the tax would mean that the

cleanups, go back to the drawing board to come up with a

new tax, and where you have a dedicated tax you don't

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL

18

MR. GRIBBON;

May if please the Court, let me

19

make clear that it is our position that this is a

20

question of law.

21

on motions for summary judgment as to what the proper

22

meaning of Section 114-C was.

The case was put to the courts below

23

Our view of it differs from that of the New

24

Jersey District Court and it also differs, as Justice

25

White pointed out, from the view that the State is now

3

He in regard that as a question of

The figures that it referred to Cc-e into this

4

case in response to New Jersey’s defense of, don’t look

5

to the purpose, look at what we did with the money.

6

that is a basic difference between them.

7

And

He believe that pre-emption clearly goes to

8

purpose, and really has nothing to do with the manner in

9

which the expenditures were made.

So, we made the

10

alternative argument that based on New Jersey’s own

11

official records, it was clear that they had not limited

12

their expenditures to non-CERCLA qualified sites, and

13

that is all that the legal issue is about.

14

Lest there be too much concern for New Jersey

15

being hobbled in its efforts to do something about

16

hazardous waste, this is a very small pre-emption that

17

Congress felt necessary when it put the whole burden of

18

the federal waste cleanup program on oil and chemicals.

19

It has nothing +o do with general revenues.

20

believe that Justice Stevens pointed out, they can

21

their general revenues any way they want to.

22

nothing to do with money that they can borrow, and New

23

Jersey has borrowed $100 million and has it sitting up

24

there, which it hasn’t used.

MR. GRIBBON:
