ORAL ARGUMENT OF K. PRESTON OADE, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Mr. Oade, you may proceed when

MR. OADE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We are here today because the individual Petitioners
have suffered what we deem to be constitutional injury by

10

being laid off on numerous occasions from their employmenet

11

as tenured public school teachers with the Jackson School

12

District in Jackson, Michigan.

13

The eight individual tenured teachers have, between

14

1976 and the present time, been laid off oi

15

from periods ranging from six weeks up to three years of no

16

employment for Petitioner Wendy Wygant.

17

another one of the individual Petitioners, has been laid off

18

eight times, eight separate times, during the past nine years.

19

The reasons for these layoffs are because of a race-

a number of occasions

Deborah Brezezinski,

20

based system for layoff contained in a labor contract between

21

their employer and their union.

22

We submit that this is an explicit use of race imposed

23

and sponsored by the state itself, the local school board

24

being an agent of the state, being a political subdivision

25

of the State of Michigan, and as such we submit that it must be

1

justified by the state and that justification must be of the

2

most compelling nature.

3

We submit to the Court that at a minimum where the

4

state seeks to assign job benefits and burdens based upon

5

race the burden is upon the state to show a state interest

6

that has some remedial character and we say, number one, the

7

state must identify an injury, identify a constitutional injury

8

that must be remedied at the expense of the individual Petitioners

9

We say, number two, the state must show that the

10

instrument or device or means chosen to remedy that identified

11

discrimination are properly tailored to achieve that end and

12

no other end.

13

Number three, we think at a minimum the state must

14

do this before, not after, before it resorts to the use of

15

race for determining job benefits.

16

do it before the use of race is assigned to determine job

17

rights, how are the courts to review whether the use of race

18

is a permissible constitutional objective and responds to

19

a proper remedial purpose?

20

If the states does not

So, the justification should not be ad hoc or ex

21

post facto.

22

adopted.

It should be done before the use of race is

23

Now, we say that the use of race in this case has

24

no remedial character and as such amounts to a nak^d racial

25

preference.

We say that because —

QUESTION:

Mr. Farris, do you think that a school

2

board has the right to look at its employees overall and to

3

look at the number of black employees it has and the number

4

of black employees available in that immediate area for employment

5

in jobs in the school and conclude for itself that the school

6

hasn't done as much as it should have to employ black employees

7

and develop a program to implement some effort to hire more

8

black employees?

9

MR. OADE:.

Justice O'Connor, we agree with that

10

and we think that as a predicate for properly conceived affirmativa

11

action that is exactly what any employer must do.

12

QUESTION:

Well, could it, as part of the program,

13

adopt some kind of layoff policy like this if it felt it were

14

necessary to complete the implementation?

15

MR. OADE:

We think that there are some differences

16

between affirmative action recruiting and what an employer

17

may do to incumbent employees.

18

We think to take two public employees, one white

19

and one black, and to treat them differently because of their

20

race must, as I have said, bear a most extraordinary justifi­

21

cation.

22

present in the abstract, I guess, is what your question goes

23

to.

24
25

And, whether or not such a justification would be

QUESTION:

Yes.

Do you think it is possible under

the kind of inquiry I suggested?
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. OADE:

I think, Justice O'Connor, there are,

2

for example, school desegregation cases where the courts have

3

found that in order to remedy on-going constitutional violations

4

in segregated school districts and in order to have effective

5

desegregation that it may be necessary to make layoffs by

6

race, but only if strictly necessary to remedy constitutional

7

violations.

8

violations in this case.

9

And, of course, there are no such constitutional

We say there is no balancing to be done.

Individuals,

10

says the Constitution, have a right to equal protection under

11

the laws.

12

some other compelling constitutional value, then there is

13

a balancing test to be done, but in this case before the Court,

14

we plead in the complaint in the lower courts in paragraph

15

21 of our complaint that — and I quote, "There has been no

16

finding of past employer discrimination in the hiring of teacher

17

personnel on the part of the Jackson School Board by a government

18

agency competent to rule on such matters."

If there is some injury that must be remedied or

19

QUESTION:

What are you reading from?

20

MR. OADE:

Paragraph 21 of the complaint.

It is

21

recited at page 12 of our reply brief and is also contained

22

in our original brief, Justice White.

23

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you with one question?

24

You discuss the importance of remedying past wrongs, which,

25

of course, is discussed a great deal in the cases.
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

Would

1

you deny the possibility that in the total absence of any

2

past wrong and any desire to remedy anything there might

3

be a valid interest in the desirability of multi-ethnic

4

representation on a teaching faculty which they cite in

5

this collective bargaining agreement?
MR. OADE:

6

To answer your question, Justice Stevens,

7

I think there is and I think the Bakke case was an example

8

of that.

9

QUESTION:

So then it would at least be

10

arguable — I am not suggesting an answer — that that kind

11

of justification might suffice in the absence of any need

12

to remedy anything?

13

MR. OADE:

It might suffice, but again -- And, I

14

think in the Bakke case there was a First Amendment interest

15

there that tne University of California Board of Regents had

16

in an ethnically

17

deprive applicants to the medical school of equal opportunity

18

to achieve that objective.

19

diverse student body.

QUESTION:

But, you could not

Well, put the Bakke case to one side

20

for a minute and talk about this case.

21

a permissible objective of the school board and the union

22

to do exactly what they said in the collective bargaining

23

agreement; that there had been trouble in the schools and

24

they thought a possible solution to their problems would be

25

some diversity of the faculty.

Why would it not be

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. OADE:

We don't think the achievement of this

2

aim was for diversity on the faculty.

3

collective bargaining agreement and on its face —

4
5

QUESTION:

We go right to the

On its face it says the desirability

of multi-ethnic representation on the teaching faculty.

6

MR. OADE:

But, the goal that that is aimed at is

7

proportional representation, Justice Stevens, between the

8

population of minorities in the student body and the teacher

9

population.

We say that that is an impermissible constitutional

10

objective if you can only get there by depriving tenured teachers

11

of employment rights.

12

I am going to talk about why that is an impermissible

13

objective and why in this case it is an unrealistic and unobtain­

14

able objective.

15

I don't think a school board should simply be able

16

to say we desire multi-ethnic representation.

17

the matter is the Jackson School Board has multi-elhnic repre­

18

sentation.

19

and employed minority teachers consistent with the available

20

supply of qualified minority teachers.

Well, assume they had never had a black

If they had never hired a black teacher

2

and did not have any, I think this would be a different case

MR. OADE:

9

I just want to — If they need to be

I think, first of all, they do need to

be remedying something.

I think there it has to have some

10

remedial character.

11

of race for determining job rights, it must have a remedial

12

character.

13

of the law just to achieve a worthy social objective that

14

the school board may think is worthy.

You can't deprive one individual of equal protection

QUESTION:

15

Whenever the state resorts to the use

You would say then that if there were

16

two people — They had a vacancy and there were two applicants,

17

a white and a b'.ack person, you would say the state could

1£

not choose the black just to increase the number of blacks

19

on the faculty absent some proof of discrimination in the

20

past?

21

MR. OADE:

No, we do not say that, Justice White.

22

QUESTION:

Well, you seem to.

23

MR. OADE:

First of all, this is not a hiring case

24

and we certainly —

25

QUESTION:

Why would the hiring case be different

1

if the reason one person is hired and the other person is

2

turned down is a racial reason and there is no proof of past

3

discrimination?

4

MR. OADE:

We think in the absence of any remedial

5

effort and the absence of any work force analysis and the

6

absence of any under-utilization of minorities in the work

7

force and in the absence of any goals and timetables or standards,

8

yes, that would be impermissible for an employer, simply for

9

the sake of race, to prefer one individual over another individual.

10

QUESTION:

But, you would say if the school board

11

just thought the blacks were under-represented that the preference

12

for the black would be quite all right as a hiring matter.

13

MR. OADE:

We are saying if —

14

QUESTION:

Even though there had been no constitutional

violation in the past.
MR. OADE:

No, I am not saying that.

3

MR. OADE:

And, I did not find it.

4

We know from two prior decisions in two related

5

cases previous to this one which we refer to as Jackson One

6

and Jackson Two, that there is no discrimination in the school

7

district as to minority hire.

8

district court who made a jurisdictional finding in 1976.

9

We know that from a county circuit court decision in 1979

We know that from a federal

10

where a county circuit court judge, Judge Britten, examined

11

the history of the Jackson School District, examined the adoption

12

of the race-based layoff system in the contract which we challenge

13

here today, which at that time minority teachers were suing

14

the school board to uphold the preference contained in the

15

agreement because the Jackson School Board had refused to

16

follow when it met laying off tenured, white, experienced

17

teachers and retaining inexperienced, minority, probationary

18

teachers.

19

in Jackson One and Jackson Two.

20

That happened in 1974.

That lead to the lawsuits

In Jackson Two, the county circuit court found that

21

there is no history of overt discrimination by the parties

22

to this labor contract.

23

Now, this contract was adopted in 1972.

Let's look

24

at the situation in the Jackson School District when this

25

contract was adopted.
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Justice Marshall asked did we have segregated schools

2

in the Jackson School District.

3

school district over a period of time had made an on-going

4

effort to keep up with changing housing patterns and had redrawn

5

their school boundary lines and built new schools in order

6

to effectively integegrate that school district and had achieved

7

that prior to the time that this contract was adopted in 1972.

8

Certainly not in '12.

This

It had also set certain minority hiring goals in

9

that school district and those minority goals are discussed

10

in our brief and they concern the fact they wanted at least

11

two minority teachers in each of the small elementary schools

12

which had between 10 and 15 teachers each.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Oade, if there had been some segregation

14

and if it was relevant, whose obligation was it to put it

15

in the record in this case?

16

MR. OADE:

The state's obligation, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

We came forward and we said we are being victimized by a labor

18

contract which exhibits on its face an intent to discriminate

19

on the basis of race and we have suffered a constitutional

20

injury because of it and it is the state that must come forward

21

to justify it.

22

compelling justification in the record, the state loses.

And, obviously, to the extent there is no

situation.

It was a healthy

You had the same number of minority teachers one
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

would expect to find given non-discriminatory hiring.

2

So, this contract was not adopted as an affirmative

3

action hiring or recruitment effort.

4

in order to do one thing, to achieve proportional representation

5

between the percentage of minorities and the student body

6

and the percentage of minority faculty.

7

minority students, they wanted 25 percent minority teachers.

8
9

It was adopted in 1972

If they had 25 percent

That is what the contract says and I quote:

"The

goal of such policy shall be to have at least the same percentage

10

as is represented by the student population of the Jackson

public schools."

But, the earlier hiring goal, was that

Is it permissible to try to get the same

the same ratio as in the student body?

MR. OADE:

Well, one has a remedial character, Justice

Stevens.

is a shortfall of minority teachers relative to the supply,

18

it didn't happen by accident, then —

20

If, in fact, you have some determination that there

It is not a remedy for the benefit of

any victim.

21

MR. OADE:

No, it is not, and that issue —

22

QUESTION:

But, nevertheless, it is permissible.

23

MR. OADE:

I don't think the Court has to reach

24

that question in this case as to whether it would have to

25

be victim-specific.

Certainly there are no findings,

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

victim-specific or otherwise.

2

this case is before this Court is because you do not have

3

findings of discrimination, either on an individual basis

4

or on a group basis.

5

And, we think the very reason

Getting back to the labor contract, the contract

6

says nothing about hiring goals or timetables.

7

about the school district's employment practices or procedures.

8
9

It says nothing

What the contract is designed to do is achieve this
racial balance and what Article XII is designed to do, as

10

put by the district court, and again I quote — Article XII,

11

to be clear, is the contract provision that assigns layoffs

12

on the basis of race.

13

Based on the district court's findings which are

14

on page 32A of our appendix to the petition, "the plan is

15

designed to either, one, retain a sufficient number of minority

16

teachers so that the racial composition of the Jackson School

17

District faculty will roughly approximate that of the student

If

body; or, two, if that ratio has not yet been achieved, then

19

at least to prevent a reduction in the minority to majority

2C

ratio."

21

So, what we have is a racial preference designed

2:

to achieve a racial balance and a prohibition against laying

23

off minority teachers if that would reduce the existing percentage

24
25

Why is that an impermissible objective, which Justice
Stevens has ini^.ired previously.

It is impermissible because

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

there is no causal nexus or relationship between the percentage

2

of minorities in the student body or the percentage of minority

3

teachers.

They are subject to totally different influences.
There are any number of reasons why you might have

4
5

a certain percentage of minorities in the student population.

6

It might reflect change in birth rates, it might reflect housing

7

habits, it might reflect racial demographics, it might reflect

8

parent choice, it might reflect population movement.

9

number of reasons can increase or decrease the percentage

10

Any

of minority students in a school district.
Now, let's look at the percentage of minority teachers.

11
12

What influences the percentage of minority teachers in a school

13

district?

14

the percentage is the supply.

15

of minority teachers who are available to be hired by any

16

school district?

17

The first and most important thing that influences
iJhat is the available supply

Taking the number, tie most recent data we have,

18

we know that in 1979 and 1980 all Michigan colleges and

19

universities graduated a certain percentage of minorities

20

with education degrees, whether it is a Bachelor's, whether

21

it is a Master's, whether it is a Ph.D, and assuming that

22

every minority that gets an education degree wants to go into

23

teaching, we know that the available supply of minority teachers

24

is at most 11 percent.

25

The school district cannot be expect to hire and
18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

retain more minority teachers than are available out there.

2

Yet they have an objective that says we have 27 percent minority

3

students, we want 27 percent minority teachers, and until

4

By 1972, this Court had charged school boards to

23

step up to their Fourteenth Amendment duties to end discrimination

24

and integrate their schools, advising boards to evaluate the

25

total facts and to review a wide range of factors.

This is exactly what the Jackson Board did as a
part of a comprehensive, four-year study.

3

The Board knew that the district had discriminated

4

against students and faculty.

5

minority teachers would be necessary for faculty integration

6

and were educationally essential to aid students who will

7

live in the society.

The Jackson Board further knew

The educational policy was sound and the governmental
interest was compelling.

QUESTION:

9

10

Mr. Susskind, before you proceed, did

I understand you to say that the Board in 1972 knew it had
been discriminating against minority teachers?

11

MR. SUSSKIND:

12

QUESTION:

It certainly did.

Did it take that position in the litigation

13

before the district court in the first case?

14

at that time.

It did deny in that case it had discrimi­

The same parties as in this case?
Different issues, however.

The discrimination issue wasn't different,
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

was it?

2

MR. SUSSKIND:

Justice Powell, first of all, when

3

this case was tried before Judge DeMascio it wasn't a question

4

of whether or not Jackson was going to integrate its schools.

5

I think Judge DeMascio made it very clear, there was no effort

6

made and no proofs put in to prove a Fourteenth Amendment

7

claim.

8
9
10

The Plaintiffs in that case, don't forget, were
the union and the black teachers simply attempting to enforce
the labor agreement.

11
12

QUESTION:

Well, whatever the issue the Board claimed

it had not discriminated.

13

MR. SUSSKIND:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SUSSKIND:

Your Honor, not only did Jackson —

Is that correc:?
That is certainly correct.

Jackson

16

had not only voluntarily integrated and when we were sued

here — very frankly the Jackson Beard at that point didn't

want to open itself up if it didn’t need to to that type of

an admission and the possibility of other lawsuits.

QUESTION:

While I am interrupting you, let me ask

21

you this question.

of discrimination by the Board?

Has there ever been any judicial decision

MR. SUSSKIND:

No judicial by the Board.

The Board,

Has there ever been any judicial decision?

You have, of course, the NAACP.

The answer with respect to this Board

is no, isn't it?

MR. SUSSKIND:

Your Honor, there has been no judicial

there was no reason for a trial.

QUESTION:

So, there has been no judicial determina­

tion?

9

MR. SUSSKIND;

That is correct for those reasons.

10

Now, let me also say as to the facts and the stipulated record,

11

Justice Powell, that Jackson surely knew what was going on

12

there, but didn't want to flail itself publicly either —

13

Frankly, when we were establishing the stipulated record

for this case and certainly not in the matter before Judge

They already had it.

The only issue there raised by the Board — In fact,

I think Mr. Oade kind of mentions it here himself —

is the question between tenured teachers and non-tentured.

Now, that was resolved in the state court under Michigan state

law.

8

though that litigation was pending, the labor agreement, colie

9

bargained, was followed.

10

The following year all the minority teachers, in fact,
Even

So, I think that is, with all due

respect, a red herring on that particular issue.

11

It seems to me that the Board, having been told

12

by this Court — I am not saying that you told Jackson speci­

13

fically — but it seems to me the clear word that was sort

14

of getting out, particularly after Brown Two and Swann.

15

don't mean to be paraphrasing perhaps what was going on here,

16

but it seems that the Court had perhaps had it with some of

17

the cases that kept coming up here with the same issues being

18

raised.

19

I

We certainly felt that you would have to look

20

where do you have your students placed, what kind of faculty

21

do you have, and if you are going to integrate, this just

22

wasn't one issue you would look at, you would look at where

23

the students are, where the faculty is, and I certainly find

24

.it — And, one of the things we should have done, and, indeed,

25

look at is as long as we were doing all of these tnings under

3

might do for us educationally and culturally.

4

the decision —

5

And, I think

Once you had, as an example, the stipulated to NAACP

complaint in 1969, I think everybody got looking at this and

7

said, gee, you know, this is not only the right thing to do,

8

but it is the right thing to do educationally, let's have

9

a culturally, ethnically diverse faculty.

No one seems to

10

quarrel with the competency of the Board to do that and no

11

one seems to have suggested that there is anything the matter

12

with it.

13

So, I guess the main fault we seem to have here

14

is that because we don't have a really good record ..s because

15

we voluntarily integrated.

16

like Columbus or Detroit and refused to integrated, did not

17

obey this Court's order until somebody sued us and made us

do it, we would have the record you would want.

We either seemed to do what this Court wanted us to do and

be glad to answer that further if the Court should desire.

QUESTION:

Well, just a short answer in response

to the question.
MR. SUSSKIND:

Certainly.

It was looking at the

6

fact it had to integrate, to look at the faculty and the students.

7

I am talking about the students by placement and the need

8

for integration and where the faculty was placed and what

9

they would have to address on that issue.

But, at the same

10

time, at the same time they were dealing with the question

11

of integration, they also were dealing with the issue of

12

educational soundness, for a diversified faculty, and dealing

13

with that problem.

14
15
16
17

Now, if you are asking me which is more important,
they were both equally important.
QUESTION:

So, the Board does rely essentially on

faculty/student ratio and the role model rationale.

18

MR. SUSSKIND:

19

and I didn't mean that.

specifically was was it their duty to integrate, how to go

about that integration, and certainly at the same time —

In 1961, you had 12,611 students, 515 teachers,

and ten of them were minority.

At that point in time, Justice O'Connor,

when you look at the number of schools we had and the number

going to get a layoff — We had just gone through this hiring

MR. SUSSKIND:

How seriously did you affect

Justice Stevens, I regret to tell

you —
QUESTION:

Does the record tell us that?

MR. SUSSKIND:

I can't honestly tell you.

I can

11

tell you that the majority teachers certainly had about —

12

or the minority teachers have an average of five years or

13

less seniority.

14

You se>i, the problem is a lot of this applies to

15

what program.

16

laid off without any regard to the racial question.

17

You can have a many-year teacher end up being

Because she was teaching the wrong subject

18

or something like that.

19

MR. SUSSKIND:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SUSSKIND:

Right.

Yes.
That is right.

If they were going

22

to lay off, for instance, ten people in the high school, it

23

may turn out that your ten less senior is your math department

24

or your entire foreign language department.

25

have to really look to the makeup of that particular layoff.

That is why you

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

It may end up with somebody with ten years' seniority, as

2

an example, ends up getting laid off without any relationship

3

to the question that brings us before this Court today.

4

That is why it is really impossible without sitting

5

down and laying that all out at any point in time and say

6

this is why it happened because that really may not be why

7

it happened at all.

8

You know, when these parties looked at this issue,

9

I think they very clearly recognized what is going to happen

10

when you subordinate your seniority.

11

each time they looked at the contract and certainly in 1977 —

12

And, by the way, by the time you get to 1977 these layoffs

13

are now getting chronic because you are having a rather

14

significant decline.

15

Not only in 1972, but

Here you are looking at, first of all, what is needed

16

in the building, what is needed in a particular program, elemen­

17

tary music, elementary art, so these parties certainly knew

18

what they were doing and the language from Article XII really

19

hasn't changed the principle at all.

20

It was certainly there.

Now, all the teachers involved we are discussing

21

are all qualified.

22

hired in an individualized way.

23

Merit isn't involved.

No one has ever suggested they weren't

You know, one of the issues

24

certainly this Court has focused on in reviewing this problem

25

is somebody is stigmatized.

Merit isn't involved, but race is.
So are a variety of other factors,

Justice White.

MR. SUSSKIND:

Not in these layoffs.
Well, you know, I have to tell you

that I don't think that is absolutely correct, sir.

the other factors —

QUESTION:

All of

The case wouldn't be here if it weren't,

I wouldn't think.
MR. SUSSKIND:

That is true, but all I am saying

11

is when you are looking at the total layoffs, Justice White,

12

you are looking at all of these other reasons.

13

frankly you have got to recognize this, if some of these other

14

problems, for instance, protection of some of these other

15

programs, hadn't been what they were, that teacher might have

16

been laid off.

17

reason was that, I think, is inappropriate and inappropriate

18

in the record.

19

Now, quite

So, to suggest very honestly that the only

20

at all that indicates there is any tie between Article XII

21

and the minority student population.

said, is a goal.

24

it doesn't have anything to do with Article XII.

in that labor agreement also and this is what we would like

to have.

because of what the goal is because of the decline in teachers,

You know, we are never probably going to get it

So, I think the attempt to take Article VII and

11

say, well, this is going to be here forever for this reason

12

would not be a proper interpretation respectfully of that

13

labor agreement.

14

Now, lot me suggest that no bad faith from anyone

15

against either tne union or the Board.

16

is well aware of that as has been alleged.

17

I think the Court

This ;s a question of di.ersity for the benefit

18

of the students.

19

standpoint, and I suggest there is no compelling state interest.

20

To end a discriminatory system does not seem to be in keeping

21

with what this Court had been saying in the 70's and certainly

22

up to the time when Jackson was first integrated.

23

this is not a situation — These parties were reviewing this

24

on

25

thing else in a labor agreement.

So, as we are looking at it from an educational

regular basis.

You know,

It has a definite life span as does any­

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

To suggest sort of in a whisper that somehow there is

2

something wrong with the process — and I am not saying the

3

Court ought to yield to constitutional questions to a labor

4

agreement necessarily — but I would rather expect that we

5

know it is part of integration, we know it is part of that

6

plan, and you know why you have done it; that rather than

7

a whisper that perhaps there is some impropriety in that process,

8

there would be some real allegations and some real proof and

9

the Petitioners never put in anything in this case, including

10
11

the pleadings.
In the sad history of really what occurred after

12

Brown Two, Jackson, I think recognizing the time to come,

13

elected to obey this Court's decisions and the law by voluntarily

14

integraling.

15

obey the law when it knew it had to obey it.

16

In doing so it didn't wait to be sued, only

Now, the language under attack here certainly arises,

17

as we lave already discussed perhaps longer than we should

18

have, from a compelling governmental interest and one which

19

we say certainly is educationally sound.

20

Now, I think this Court has indicated that school

21

boards have a specialized ability to perhaps deal with these

22

educational issues.

23

We furnish students with an ethenically diverse

24

faculty so they can learn to live in a pluralistic society

25

and that certainly is one of the goals and it is certainly
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

still true today.

2

Now, through education the time is going to come

3

when society will be able to be truly colorblind and judge

4

people as I think this Court would want it to without regard

5

to race.

6

20 years.

7

that you have here aren't going to be before this Court.

8

Certainly the best place for this matter to be dealt with

9

are in your educational halls.

This is not, however, we would suggest to move back
It is the time to move forward where these issues

How are you going to deal

10

with that if we aren't going to have this type of diverse

11

ethnic faculty to work.

12

And, is the Board going to be second guessed in

13

its good faith effort when it was supposed to be looking at

14

whether or not it should integrate, when it did so over a

15

four-year period, and it attempted to address the problem

16

through the layoff clause not unilaterally, but with its teachers

17

throujh the adversary process of collective bargaining.

18

This is really a situation that is a little bit

19

different.

20

it certainly wasn't court-imposed language.

21

not only agreed to it in 1972, but these competent teachers,

22

all of whom are well degreed, have felt it a good idea to

23

continue this right through to the present date.

24

aware of this case too.

25

This wasn't a court ordered integration case and
These parties

of the issue that there are some pretty strong process con­

You have a good faith effort of competent parties,

5

designed to protect the gains made, not to harm these Petitioners

or anybody else.

7

language of Article XII found so offensive by the Petitioners

8

should not be found offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment.

9

We would suggest on that basis that the

As you know, this case at bar here was presented on

10

stipulated facts, stipulated to the district court, no factual

11

question was ever raised before the Sixth Circuit.

12

the governmental interest is compelling, so is the educational

13

interest.

We would ask this Court to affirm the opinion of
the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Thank you.

QUESTION:

We believe

May I just ask you what may be a frivolous

question?

19

MR. SUSSKIND:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I was interested in the fact that minorities

21

described in the collective bargaining agreement include blacks,

22

American Indians, Orientals, or persons of Spanish decendency.

23

How in the world would you determine who is a person of Spanish

24

decendency?

MR. SUSSKIND:

You know — Let me say one thing

about this role model question if I may and which I think

12

will give you an answer to your question.

13

Now, we weren't hiring black teachers that could

We wouldn't hire an American Indian to each Indians either.
