grave reservations about the propriety of their chopping

without a search warrant, armed only with an order to

Because of these grave reservations, they

So if the prosecuting -- if the

county attorney, if that is the term in Hamilton County,

wants a particular item seized by the police, he can

I did not say that.

question.

The

The Court of Appeals did say the county

prosecutor is a policymaking official in this area of

activity, and did say that the constitutional rights of

the doctor were in fact violated, but found that there

was no policy in this particular case because of the

failure to implement the county prosecutor's position

What ioes the word "policy" mean?

defined in Tuttle as the selection from alternative

courses of action, and here the county prosecutor had

the option of getting a search warrant — the county

But in this case the Sixth Circuit

held that its McKinney case, which I gather was based cn

14

MR. MANLEY;

That is correct, but you see,

there, Mr. Justice Rshnguist, Waylan is subject to a

MR. MANLEY;

That didn’t happen in this case.
Well, I know, but if it had

20

like this are not retroactive.

Don't you agree that new decisions

MR. MANLEY:

At

For purposes of the exclusionary

QUESTION;

I would think your policy argument

-- if you accept — the best argument for your policy

10

argument for a county policy is to accept the Sixth

11

Circuit's statement that it was not contrary to law at

12

the time, because you would think that the county

13

officers would be carrying out procedures that the

14

constitution permitted.

15

ME. MANLEY;

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Well, as a matter of fact —
And that is exactly what they

testified to.
ME. HANLEY:

That is exactly what the sheriff

19

testified to, that he was of the opinion that this was

20

permissble --

21

QUESTION:

But if it were contrary to clearly

established law at the time, I think you would have a

tough time establishing a policy from a single act.

There is no question about that.

QUESTIONi

Do you distinguish policy from

practice?

3

MR. MANLEY;

Well, that is why I started to

4

say the Sixth Circuit, I think, get off on the wrong

5

track, but if you are trying to prove policy hy means of

6

a longstanding practice or custom, T think you have tc

7

show more than one time, repeated occurrences, and maybe

8

even as in Rizzo 20 cases is not enough.

9

But on the other hand, a policy doesn't have

10

to be proven by circumstantial evidence.

11

be proven by the statements or the writings or the

12

actions of a

policymaker.

MR. MANLEY;

MR. MANLEY;

There is nothing like that here,

it would be well to clarify several points that were

That in fact is not correct.

The police

It was a deputy sheriff who contacted, his
supervisor, who in turn connected the deputy sheriff to
the prosecutor's office, and the deputy sheriff first

8

talked to an assistant prosecuting attorney who went in

9

and talked to the prosecuting attorney, and the message

10
11

was relayed back to the deputy sheriff.
One other matter,

and this is a minor matter,

but on Page 3 in Footnote 4 of the petitioner's reply

brief he indicates that the respondents have changed

14

their argument from the Court of Appeals in that in the

15

Court of Appeals we were not arguing that it was not a

16

policy of Hamilton County which caused the deprivation.

17

I believe that the statement that is in the

taken out of context to the entire paragraph in our

12

would have been a policy.

13

It may have been a custom in the county that would have

QUESTION;

Kay I ask you one other question#

because you called attention to Footnote 4 on the reply
brief, and you indicated that your brief had teen -portions had been taker, out of context# and

they

indicate, they quote from your brief saying there is a
distinction.

They seem to suggest that you drew a

distinction between a policy of the county itself on the
one hand and a policy of either the sheriff cr the
prosecutor on the other.

Do you maintain that there is

a difference, that the county prosecutor or the county
sheriff could have a policy for which the county would
not be responsible?
NE. FPIEDKANN;

Your Honor,

I believe that the

county prosecutor could have a policy perhaps with
regard to the operation of his office for which the
county itself does not recognize him as the final
repository of authority.

In that situation he could

have a policy that is not necessarily the policy of

2

he has the ultimate responsibility in that area where

3

that is the policy of the county.

4

Conversely, he could have a policy if

QUESTION;

5

prosecutor or both collectively had a policy regatdinq

7

that as being county policy but were their policy?

8

MR. FRIEDMANN*

9

QUESTION;

Would you question

If the prosecutor had it?

Say if the -- or say if the

10

sheriff, after consulting with the prosecutor, concluded

11

that it would be his policy to do exactly what they did

12

here, if that were true, would that be county policy in

13

your view?

14

MR. FRIEDMANN*

The ultimate decision with

15

regard to the execution of an arrest warrant that is

16

directed to the sheriff, I believe, the ultimate

17

responsibility lies with the sheriff to effectuate that

18

warrant, and in that regard, unless there is a specific

19

state statute that requires h^m to do something else,

20

think he would be the ultimate policymaker in that

21

regard.

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. FRIEDMANN*

Thank you.
Your Honor, I think in cases

protecting the rights of individuals.
In the present case we have a situation where
all persons involved in the local governmental process

MR. MANLEY*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Initially, Mr.

took place in that after the event, the sheriff caused a

12

complete investigation to be made, and the record in

14

that his people got from the county prosecutor, and

15

indicated that what his people did was completely

16

consistent with the policies of his office at that time,

so that while we don’t have the conversation that Mr.
