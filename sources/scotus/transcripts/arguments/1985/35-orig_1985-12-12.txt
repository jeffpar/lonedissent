there the Court had before it a controversy as to the

status of Euzzards Bay,

refer the Court to the charts appended to either of the

briefs, you will see that Buzzards Bay is one of the

semi-contiguous bodies of water to Nantucket Sound.

13

and it is a famous case, it's been discussed by almost

14

all the interna tioal publicists at length, as to the

15

Buzzards Bay case in 1981 -- interestingly enough, this

16

Court said very succinctly, without equivocation,

17

18

owner, that it has Buzzards Bay by virtue of its

province charter."

Mr. Herrmann, do you think that

title acquired in that fashion can be abandoned by the

2

states?

3

MR. HERRMANN;

Theoretically, yes, Your Honor,

4

but our position is, we have briefed that.,

5

like to point out again, while in theory it could be

6

abandoned, in practice prevailing international law

7

implies extremely strict provisions, how that must

8

occur, and if those provisions are not met the theory of

9

lapse or abandonment of an already perfected title, and

and I would

10

may I just address that distinction, what the Master was

11

talking about and what I think Your Honor is talking

12

about is, once a title is perfected can it be abandoned

13

or can it lapse .

14

What the Master was talking about later in the

15

discussion, and what the Government is focusing on is --

16

was a so-called historic title ever acquired.

17

the perfected ancient title which was now perfected in

18

colonial times, no, I would say in theory yes, but it is

19

quite clear that international law, both by the courts

20

and the publicists, this so-called active abandonment

21

theory is definitely in disfavor.

22

But as tc

It's in disfavor because it leads tc

23

instability of international titles and possible

24

international tensions.

25

QUESTION;

Well, there's no problem here,
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

because if the state doesn’t have it the United States

2

does.

3

possible I must say it's hard for me to understand why

4

the legislative acts of disclaimer by Massachusetts and

5

the publication of its official charts don’t reflect

6

abandonment by the State of Massachusetts.

There's no lapse in title, and if abandonment is

ME. HERRMANN;

7

Your Honor, I don't think -- I

8

submit that they do not reflect abandonment by

9

Massachusetts for the following reasons.

If Your

10

Honor’s referring to the late 19th Century charts that

11

were published by the harbor and land commissioners,

12

those were

13

14

statute by the legislature.

published upon the mandate of the

Just like the British Territorial Waters

15
16

Jurisdiction Act, both those statutes were passed as an

17

almost emergency measure to cure the problem that

18

apparently there was no criminal jurisdiction in the

19

open water, on

20

very quickly, because of two cases that involved the

21

inability to prosecute a criminal, so the Legislature

22

almost on an emergency basis extended its jurisdiction

23

seaward.

24
25

the seacoast.

The problem was quickly --

So, the first thing is they had no Intent, and
Mahler versus Transportation which we cite in cur brief

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

denis with that problem so there should be no inference

2

that a state -- a legislature is abandoning a state

3

seabed unless they expressly say so.

4

The purpose of that legislation was not to

5

abandon territory already vested in the State.

Its

6

purpose was purely one to extend on an emergency basis,

7

curial jurisdiction for criminal purposes.

8

one.

That's point

Point two is that if you look, as I think one

9
10

must, at the state statute and the large-scale charts of

11

1891 -- I*m sorry, 1883, you look at them together

12

because they are a unitary manifestation.
As we pointed out in our brief, the charts are

13
14

ambiguous.

They do not show an intent to abandon

15

Nantucket Sound with -- not specificity as is required

16

under international law.

17

Why?

Because if Nantucket Sound had been high

18

seas, as the Government contends, there would have had

19

to have been a closing line between Vineyard Sound,

20

clearly,

21

Massachusetts exhibits, Your Honor, as we have referred

22

to it in your brief.

23

and Nantucket Sound.

That is Exhibit 4 of

It is clear that the Harbor and Land

24

Commissioners had a great deal of problem reconciling

25

that criminal jurisdiction statute and what they
1 0
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

perceived to be the actual status of Nantucket Sound,

2

which was not high seas.

3

Finally, Your Honor, I would ask you to

4

consider the following point.

5

constitutionally impermissible for a state to diminish

6

the national domain, once -- and this is what the

7

Special Waster really found — if there was a perfected

8

ancient title, that was then state seabed but it was

9

also a part of the national domain, and I do not think

I submit that it is

10

that any state legislature under our constitutional

11

system has the right to disclaim territory that belongs

12

tc the nation as a whole, as well as to it.

13

So, for those three reasons, A, it wasn't the

14

legislative intent to abandon anything; E, they did net

15

do so effectively, look at the charts that went with the

16

statute; and C, I don't think

17

constitutional power to.

18

they have the

Eut tc return again, Your Honor, to the first

19

part of your question,

20

international law?

21

been, I suggest to you,

22

at the time the Units! States says that there was a

23

lapse, that is in the last century, and this is an

24

interesting historical point,

25

incidentally, was in 1949 during the Truman proclamation

2

which extended the United States' assertion of imperium

3

and dominion from the three-mile limit out to the edge

4

of the continental shelf.

5

At the time in question, in the late 1890*s,

6

it would have been — the option was clearly, either

7

inland waters and ergo, state seabed, or, net belonging

8

to the United States at all.

postwar manifestation.
The elements, quickly stated in bare outline,

12

because there has been much written about it by the

13

publicists, in internatioal law to have abandonment

14

which is not favored, you have to look to the exact

15

circumstances.

16

First,

the question of time.

As long as there is not an adverse claimant

17

and the United States has not proven -- has net even

18

suggested that since colonial times any other foreign

19

nation or group of foreign nations has ever even hinted

20

at a claim to Nantucket Sound, absent an adverse

21

claimant, the World Court, the International Court of

22

Justice has in

24

which cf course there is not

1 2
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

There were always exploitation activities and

1

2

assertions of dominion.

But even assuming for the

3

moment for the sake of the argument that from colonial

4

times, let's say from the time of the Revolution, there

5

had been a total cessation of assertion ever Nantucket

6

Sound, the '^orld Court in the two cases we cited, the

7

case of the Minkes and Ekrahoes Islands in the Channel,

8

the British Channel, and in the case, the so-called

9

Eastern Greenland case,

in both those cases a time

10

period of over 200 years was deemed as not significant

11

for one reason only, the absence of an adverse claimant

12

which is also absent here.
Secondly, it seems well settled in

13
14

international law, according to the pre-eminent experts

15

whose views we cite in our brief, that you have to

16

consider two more circumstances if abandonment is tc be

17

argued about.

19

One is the geographical situation on the

It seems wall settled that if the so-called

20

abandoned territory is in direct geographic proximity,

21

if it’s integrated into the territory or very much

22

adjacent to it, of the so-called abandoning state,

23

counts heavily against such a presumption.

24

important, if the so-called abandoning nation at all

times during the time period involved retains the power

2

if it wishes -- I'm not talking about actual assertion

3

but if it has the de facto power to reach out, as it

were, at any point in time and assert its jurisdiction

5

over that area, then it seems settled in international

6

law that you can have no presumption of abandonment from

6

in a more precise way.

I invite the Court first to look at the chart

It seems to us that when you look at that map

8

and you look at Nantucket Islani, what you see is an

9

island in the sea, not a bay,

not an extra mouth to an

10

inlet, but an islani around which there is a strait.

11

There’s a strait from the eastern entrance to Nantucket

12

Sound between Vineyard and Nantucket Sound, and there's

13

another strait which is indeed a well marked navigation

14

channel going from the eastern entrance toNantucket

2

Convention under Article 4, but a procedure, a method

3

which the United States has at all times declined to

4

follow and which this Court has determined is a matter

5

for the Government of the United States to determine and

6

net for the Court to review.

7

This configuration is wholly unlike all the

8

examples that are mentioned in the briefs and in the

9

report in this case.

It is aot like Delaware Bay or

10

Chesapeake Bay cr Boston Harbor or Buzzards Bay or Long

11

Island Sound, all of which are clear, deep indentations

12

into the mainland, nor is it like Mississippi Sound And

13

Chandelier Sound which this Court has characterized as

14

cul-de-sacs, dead ends,

not a straight in and out.

Despite the fact that this case has been

15
16

proceeding at its usual slow pace for many years,

17

despite the fact that this question of whether a

18

configuration of this kind can qualify as inland,

19

Massachusetts has to this day never suggested that

20

English law or American law has at any time

21

characterized such a like body of water elsewhere as

because it refers to a three-mile belt in one of its

14

we're claiming jurisdiction over so much of the Sound as

But at all events, even if we misread the

statute, this Court has squarely held in the Alaska case

19

that a claim to fishery regulation is not sufficient to

20

establish an accession of sovereignty as inland water,

21

and therefore fishery regulation would net suffice.

22

Now,

in the hundreds of documents introduced

don't have a single one that reflects an expressed

QUESTION*

2

Well, Mr. Claiborne, it seems to me

3

that what Massachusetts is claiming is something under a

4

so-called doctrine of ancient title on the theory that

5

under that doctrine it in fact acquired title in

6

colonial times regardless of what its claims were since.

7

Do you concede that there is such a doctrine

as ancient title which we would follow if the elements

title is clear and secondly that it was continually

asserted rather than clearly abandoned, as was the case

21

here, in the intervening time.

22

Yes, in that we recognize that there can

if that is what is meant by ancient

The Court there found that with

$hat is more,

it was expressly clcsed in that

11

way by Massachusetts legislative declaration of 1881

12

which had been implemented by a map introduced in the

case in this Court which showed the closure, nothing

QUESTION;

15

All right, but if Massachusetts is

16

correct that it acquired ancient title at one time, and

17

if you are correct that it was abandoned later by

18

Massachusetts at a time when the United Ttates was not

19

claiming it, does that mean that the title then passed

20

to international usage and the boundaries of the United

21

States were altered, at the time of any abandonment?
MR. CLAIBORNE; Justice C’Connor, if one

22
23

assumes,

contrary to oar argument that there ever was a

24

perfected claim or perfected ancient title, and that

25

that title survived until -- or through

the period

(202) 628-9300

when

1

the United States became a sovereign nation, then what

2

Your Honor suggests could indeed be the result, but it

3

was open to the United States to reclaim that area as it

4

did with respect to the resources of the seabed in the

5

Truman Proclamation of 1945, and as it has with respect

6

to fisheries in other legislation, and as it could with

respect to all

9

by using a straight base line method which as a matter

there is no getting around Massachusetts engaged in,

It is the Master who

It says, the last sentence, last full sentence

6

on that page, "Therefore, whatever rights it may have

had over Nantucket Sound during the Colonial period."

8

Now, that's got to be a reference to the so-called

ancient title,

10
11
12
13

"lapsed until the Commonwealth's attempt

tc resuscitate" -QUESTION;

That would make a whole lot of

sense with the final sentence of the paragraph.
MR. CLAIBORNEs

Yes, Your Honor.

The

14

expression "historic title," after all, is very close tc

15

the "historic waters" which is the term this Court and

16

the International Convention have both used.

And of

17

course an ancient title is a historic title.

It's one

18

based on history.

19

QUESTION*

Mr. Claiborne, if you look at page

20

51 of the Master's report, at

21

the one over paragraph at the top, the Master says,

22

"Massashusetts can establish an ancient title tc

23

Nantucket Sound only if the Supreme Court holds that the

24

clear beyond doubt standard is inappropriate in this

25

proceeding."

the end of the paragraph,

Then he starts his Section 2, The History of

2

Historical Geography,

3

that as an independent basis for its claim Massachusetts

4

argues that even if that title didn't pass under the

5

Royal Charters or as a result of the doctrine of inter

6

fauces terra, Massachusetts nevertheless has title by

7

virtue of history and usage.
So, I concluded,

8

9

which begins with the explanation

frankly, in reading his

report that the language back on page 65 was a

10

resolution of this historical claim of continuous

11

occupation and that he had dealt with the ancient title

12

claim in the language that I read to you in the middle

13

of page 51.
ME. CLAIBORNEi

14

Justice O'Connor, I must

15

confess that the report seems to us, as to others, less

16

than absolutely clear.

17

reconcile it is to read the passage which Your Honor

18

referred to on page 51 as meaning that the perfection of

19

the ancient, title has not been shown if the clear beyond

20

doubt standard is applicable without prejudice to the

21

second question, whether that title, if effected,

22

survived .

23

I think the only way you can

And, that second question is dealt with under

the general heading, in subpart D, I think, repeating,

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

It's a

genuine discussion of the entire Massachusetts claim.
It doesn't say Evaluation of the Massachusetts
Historic Claim, but the whole of it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, under D -1 , Vineyard

Sound, the first sentence says, he concludes that there

is historic title to that.

7

discusses why they hive historic title, and then

8

Nantucket Sound, it talks about historic title.

9

EP. CLAIBORNE:

Then he goes through and

However one reads the Master's

10

report, it does seem to us that the Master has made a

11

finding, on page 65, that whatever rights over Nantucket

12

Sound accrued during the Colonial period, which he

13

suggests were none but whatever they might have been,

14

have long since lapsed by renunciation.

15

QUESTION:

Well, that assumes that --

16

MR. CLAIBORNE:

That finding may in

the

17

Master's mind net be relevant to ancient title.

18

whatever he might have thought about that, his finding

19

is a matter of fact.

20

QUESTION:

We say,

His finding is, but that -- you

21

want to say that the lapse idea applies to ancient title

22

as well as to historic title?

23

MR. CLAIBORNE:

It's professed by -- it's

24

conceded by Massachusetts that ancient title can be

25

lost, and since ancient title requires to be fortified

by long usage, it must follow that it is lost by

2

non-usage and all the more so by express disclaimer.
QUESTION;

3

If you read page 51 as the end of

4

the discussion cf ancient title, it's a strange posture

5

to leave the case in if the faster thought that ancient

title had lapsed.

MR. CLAIBORNE;

proved ancient title.

12

It wouldn’t make any difference what

You are going to argue the standard

of proof?
MR. CLAIBORNEs

13

Well, with respect to the

14

standard of proof, we submit that this Court has very

15

clearly,

16

to them the clear lead of the Court, and that the Court

17

has approved the Masters’ report, to the effect that

18

when the United States in its sovereign decision

19

disclaims an area, never mind when it disclaims it, it

20

is going to be ineffective if it comes too late in the

21

sense that it's not dispositive, but it at least has

22

this effect, so the Court has said, which is to require

23

the State to prove that its historic claim, and that

24

should apply whether it’s an ancient title or a

25

so-called historic title, is quite clear and that it is

and that its Masters have followed what seemed

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

therefore quite wrong and unfair for the United States

2

to come in so late and attempt to defeat it.
And that much is due to the decision that the

3
4

United States, to define its borders in a certain wav.

5

It seems to us that, as it did to the Master here, that

6

this Court has quite clearly fixed that standard when

7

there is a disclaimer, and here there is a disclaimer,

8

nc question about the fact that the United States is and

9

has disclaimed title to Nantucket Sound or to the center

10
11

of it.
That disclaimer may or may not be belated, but

12

it does at least require that the states proof be at a

higher standard, and that is not an extraordinary

proposition.
