ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARCY J .K . TIFFANY, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MS. TIFFANYi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, this case involves a conspiracy by

11

Indiana dentists to refuse ex-rays requested by group

12

dental health care insurers.

13

ex-rays to detect instances of fraudulent claims and

14

overtreatment of dental patients.

15

The insurers needed the

Their goal was to contain the cost cf the

16

Insurance programs they were administering, a goal that

17

vas shared, indeed, insisted upcn by these whe were

18

footing the bill for the programs, the employers, and

19

unions who had negotiated the dental benefits.

20

The attitude of the dentists toward this ccst

21

containment effort was best summed up in the words of

22

Tr. David McClure, one cf the chief organizers cf the

23

conspiracy here.

24

situation as, and I quote, "economics war where the name

25

cf the game is money.”

this one had its victims.

Here they were the patients,

the consumers, who were

5

The dentists* response to the insurance

6

companies* cost containment efforts should net be

7

surprising, since from their perspective cost

8

containment essentially means fewer dollars for the

9

dentists.

-To again quote Dr. McClure, "Management,

10

government, labor, and the insurance industry are

11

determined to reduce the cost of the dental health

12

dollar at the expense of the dentist."

13

Now, a third party payer faces a difficult

14

problem with respect to cost containment.

In the normal

15

purchase transaction the individual consumer has an

16

interest in making sure that he is not paying for mere

17

than he needs.

18

the tab, consumer self-interest tends tc coincide with

19

that of the seller, which is to say, get as much as

20

possible cut cf the insurance company.

However, when an insurer is picking up

Thus, the responsibility is left tc the plan

it is paying only for services that are covered under

24

the contract.

25

In this case the dentists were well aware that

the ex-rays were needed for this purpose.

2

McClure yet again, "The fight for ex-rays will continue,

3

tecause this is the only way insurance companies can

4

control their costs."

Tc quote Er.

The fight began with the Indiana Dental

5
6

Association, which is composed of 85 percent of all

7

licensed dentists in the state of Indiana.

8

organized the boycott, and did so very effectively.

9

They adopted a set of principles of acceptability which

submitted would net be acceptable.

the

1

insurance companies so they could determine whether the

2

claim should be paid.

3

The efforts were very successful, and the

4

Administrative Law Judge found that eventually most

5

Indiana dentists were refusing tc provide the ex-rays tc

6

the insurers.

7

Now, about that time this Court decided the

8

Gcldfarb case, which of course held that professions dc

9

not enjoy any special immunity from the antitrust laws.

10

The leaders of the IDA boycott were understandably

11

nervous about their possible antitrust liability.

12

response was tc form the Indiana Federation of Dentists

13

under the mistaken belief that if they styled themselves

14

as a union they would be immune from the antitrust laws.

15

The

To once more quote the irrepressible Dr.

16

McClure, who was the first president of the Indiana

17

Federation of Dentists, "They would no longer have the

18

antitrust albatross around their necks."

19

The mandate of IFD was clear, to continue and

20

intensify the boycott that was begun by IDB.

Equally

21

clear was the economic motivation for the formation of

22

IFD, as evidenced by, among ether things, the

23

constitution and bylaws.

24

IFD was organized to represent the socioeconomic and

25

political interests of the dentists.

They explicitly stated

(202) 628-9300

that

The constitution and bylaws authorized

strikes,

pressure, and they provided fcr discipline of

4

5

after six weeks of trial, the Commission concluded that

this conduct reduced or eliminated competition among

7

dentists as to their policy in dealing with third party

insurers.

QUESTION*

Based cn a record developed

Ms. Tiffany, the Commission refused

10

tc find that it had the result of diminishing

11

competition among insurers, did it not?

12
13
14

MS. TIFFANY*

The Commission declined to find

that it diminished competition among insurers.
QUESTION*

The Commission seems to have

15

conducted a sort of abbreviated rule of reason analysis

16

here, not really doing a full-blown inquiry into the

17

economic effects of the boycott, as I understand it.

18

MS. TIFFANYt

That’s correct.

The rule of

19

reason analysis was applied here, although the

20

Administrative law Judge had found that a per se

21

analysis would have been appropriate to this conduct.

22

The line, however, between per se and rule of reason is

23

not always a clear one, as this Court noted in the ICAA

24

case, and —

25

QUESTIONi

Do you think an abbreviated rule of

reason analysis is justified?
MS. TIFFSNY*

I don’t telieve we would refer

3

to it as an abbreviated rule of reason.

was conducted — a rule of reason analysis was

5

conducted, and it was extensive enough, given the facts

in this case,

involved horizontal competitors who were refusing tc

13

deal with third parties except on terms and conditions

14

that they had agreed to, that they had specified between

16

Paramont Famous

That case, like this one,

\

It is also very much like the Professional

17

Engineers case.

Here, the dentists were restricting the

18

flow of price-related information.

19

had been provided, it would have enabled insurers tc

20

determine whether the dentists are overtreating, which

21

is the economic functional equivalent of overcharging.

22

This in turn would have enabled the insurers

If this information

23

to make purchasing determinations that would have

24

lowered their costs.

25

Professional Engineers, while this is not a naked price

Thus, as was the case in

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

restraint, it is a restraint that directly impacts

2

price.

3

Without this type of restraint, decisions as

4

to the types of services purchased would have been made

5

as a function cf the interplay cf the market forces.

6

Now, the Seventh Circuit did reject the

7

Commission's findings on an evidentary basis, finding

8

that there was insubstantial evidence to show that the

9

boycott restrained trade.

This holding of the Seventh

10

Circuit means that there is really a very narrow issue

11

facing this Court, and that is whether the Court of

12

Appeals misapplied the standard review when it reversed

13

the Commission's decision.

14

The importance of this case, however, goes far

15

beyond the narrow legal issue-to be resolved here.

16

problem of cost containment in the context of third

17

party insurers is a large one.

18

really dwarf the facts in this particular case.

19

The

It has dimensions that

20

problem cf rapidly rising health costs is one that is

here to stay.

encountered by the insurance companies in Indiana are

23

being faced throughout the country.

Indeed, problems similar to those

MS. TIFFANY*

The Commission basically took

19

the position that it really wasn’t necessary to

20

establish one way or the other that the cost containment

21

efforts were in fact effective in this particular case,

22

rather, that the insurance companies were entitled tc

23

give an innovative cost containment effort a chance tc

24

operate, which they did not have here, and in fact that

25

was one of the difficulties of getting evidence in

Yes.

competition, even if it maybe isn't in the public

MS. TIFFANY*

12

Well, there were several effects

on competition, several ways that competition was

restrained.

make these determinations as to whether they were being

QUESTION*

Ms. Tiffany, Judge Fairchild’s

concurring opinion, he didn’t join Judge Coffey’s

16

opinion, he says pretty clearly that no evidence was

17

developed on the validity of an assumption that a

18

dentist’s policy of refusal of cooperation has any

19

significance in competition among dentists, and the ETC

20

decision fails to analyze the proposition.

I take it you disagree with his opinion.

Because of this restraint, the purchasers cf the

information that would allow them to cost compare.

9

Here, the purchasers have to be understood in

10

the context both of the patients who are purchasing and

11

the third party insurer who is paying for it.

12

effect is essentially to have a bifurcated purchaser.

for the insurance companies tc do their part, tc be able

19

to make the determinations that they were willing to

That is absolutely correct, Mr.

Chief Justice, and the record shows that the insurance

companies were sensitive to that, indeed, in some

21

instances, in trying tc negotiate a plan that would be

22

more acceptable, had agreed

23

where the pack would take two ex-rays at the same time,

allowing the dentist tc have one copy and sending the

other copy in to the insurer, and the insurer was

decided that the Commission had failed to evidence

Thus,

absent the rare instance where the Court of appeals

11

grossly misapplied the substantial evidence standard,

12

the Commission should net prevail today, and the Seventh

The final order of the Commission upon the

12

should be applied, and they specifically stated a number

13

of reasons why that is so.

14

specifically the conduct involved in by IFE was not

15

aimed primarily at excluding competitors, it was not
