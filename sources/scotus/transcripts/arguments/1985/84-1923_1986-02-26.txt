ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court, this case presents

10

important questions of subject matter jurisdiction of a

11

Federal District Court in cases arising under the Social

12

Security Act.

13

Congress granted its consent to such suits

14

when it enacted Section 405(g) of Title 42.

15

Congress imposed two specific restr.ctions on that

16

waiver of sovereign immunity.

17

But

First, Congress has provided that judicial

18

review is available only after "the; Secretary's final

19

decision, after a hearing."

20

review is available only if the individual commences an

21

action within 60 days after the mailing to him of the

22

notice of the final decision or within such further time

23

as the Secretary may allow.

24
25

And secondly, judicial

This Court has repeatedly made clear in
Yamasaki and Diaz and Salfi that in order for a person

to be included as a member of a class, he must

2

individually satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of

3

that section.

4

in the class, he has to have been able to file his own

5

indiviudal suit when the suit was filed.

6

In other words, in order to be included

The Court of Appeals in this case completely

7

disregarded these principles.

suit to challenge the manner in which evidence of mental

9

impairment was being evaluated by the New York State

Respondents brought this

10

Agency under several regulation issued by the Secretary

11

to implement the statutory definition of disability.

12

Any member of the class in this case who

13

disagreed with a state agency's decision that he was

14

able to work and therefore was not disabled within the

15

meaning of the Act was free to take an administrative

16

appeal to the ALJ, to the appeals Counsel, and then to

17

seek judicial review in District Court.

18

In fact, in this case seven of the eight

19

individuals who are claimants in this case did go to the

20

ALJ stage.

23

members in this case were explicitly informed that they,

1

too, had a right to seek further review, including going

2

to the ALJ and appeals counsel, they declined to do so.

3

When they declined to seek re/iew in <jU days, their

4

decisions became final and binding against them, and

5

they therefore accepted the consequence that those

6

decisions were in effect res judicata.

7

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Kneedler, I guess the

8

problem is that the District Court found that the

9

Secretary's policy involved in this case was a covert

10

one.

11

somebody who doesn't know of the policy at all or have a

12

reason to know according to the District Court's finding

13

going to meet the requirement, and that is why you have

14

to meet the so-called

15

It had been hidden from public scrutiny.

How is

tolling argument, I think.

MR. KNEEDLERs

The District Court labeled the

16

policy secret, but all it could have meant by secret, I

17

submit, is that —

QUESTIONS

And you didn't file any challenge

to that in this Court?
MR. KNEEDLERs

Well, it wasn't — if what the

24

courts below meant by that was that there was some

25

affirmative act of concealment of what was going on,

You talk about it, but I had just

assumed we had to take that finding as a given.

15

MR. KNEEOLER;

We don't regard it as a

16

finding, and have not throughout, and this is what we

17

argued in the Court of Appeals at oral argument and in

18

the rehearing petition, that all that happened here, and

19

all the plaintiffs raally tried to establish at trial

20

was that the various memoranda that they relied upon as

21

evidence of the policy were not published, or were not

22

routinely made available to the claimants.

23

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Kneedler, is that quite

24

accurate?

25

even the ALJ's were unaware of what the physicians were

I thought that the trial court found that

QUESTIONS

L

Isn't that so?
Well, the ALJ *s —
tha only onas who knew anything

4

whatever about it were the state and perhaps also the

5

federal agency, but it wasn't, as Justice O'Connor said,

6

something that was made generally known to the public,

7

was it?

8
9

MR. KNEEDLERi

No, I am not suggesting that it

was published, but what I am saying is that the

10

application of the regulations that these memoranda

11

refer to were contained in the sort of routine internal

12

memoranda that go on all the time in the administration

13

of the program.

14

QUESTION*

I don't see how the class members

15

could have raised this question before the agency if

16

they didn't know about it.

17

MR. KNEEDLERi

The question is not whether

18

they could have raised _his specific question.

19

issa i is whether they knew that their claims were denied

20

on the basis of a finding that they could work.

21

decisions that the class members in this case received

from the state agency said that.

What form did it take when it was

finally made public?

11

MR. KNEEDLER*

Well, it was litigated in the

12

Minnesota mental health case out in Minnesota, and there

13

were, as I understand it. Freedom of Information Act

14

requests for regional documents that referred to this.

15

So that may have been the occasion.

17

public notice took?

But that is the form that the

MR. KNEEDLER*

18

I misunderstood.

You said when it became

19

public.

The objection tf at is being

20

raised here is the manner, in a sense almost the thought

21

process by which an adjudicator decides whether a person

22

can work, and what the claimants are objecting to is

23

that the regulations were misapplied in a certain way by

24

an adjudicator.

25

an internal memorandum or the thought processes of the

Whether that in turn is attributable to

(20 2) 628-9300

1

individual state agency adjudicator seems to us to be

2

irrelevant for purposes of the ability of a claimant to

3

seek review.

4

If it was found out a year later that a

5

particular adjudicator was consistently applying wrong

6

principles at the state agency level, this would not

7

excuse a claimant from seeking further review within 60

8

days, just as if a case was being tried in the District

9

Court and it came to light that the District Judge who

10

decided the case was under a misapprehension of how a

11

law should be applied and had entered

12

13

in a Social Security case.

19

scheme, these applicants, these people with mental

20

deficiencies are entitled to a fair individualized

2

review of policies or positions of the Secretary.

3

provides for judicial review of decisions by the

4

Secretary on claims for benefits, and if a particular

5

approach to the way a claim was decided remains an issue

6

at the time a case gets to the appeals counsel, then the

7

way in which a case was finally disposed of by the

8

Secretary is subject to judicial review when the person

9

files a suit under Section 405(g), but all through the

is seeking review of is the denial of his claim.

15

particular objection that the claimants have here is

16

that they suggest that RFC was determined in an

17

inappropriate manner, but RFC is not an end in itself.

18

The RFC calculation is part of the manner in which the

19

decisionmaker weighs the evidence of the impairment and

20

decides whether it prevents the claimant from working.

21

It is an essential element of the merits of the dispute,

22

so someone who is disagreeing with the way a

23

decisionmaker made that decision is in effect just

24

disagreeing with the decisionmaker's decision tKat he

that they needed to pursue the denial of their claims.

3

As I said, they were told that it had been found that

they could work, that they were therefore not disabled,

and that if they disagreed with that determination, they

6

could seek further review within 60 days.

The sort of

memoranda that are relied upon by

8

the claimants in this case, I would like to say several

9

things about it.

First, there is no suggestion

10

anywhere, and we have repeatedly pointed this out, and

11

the plaintiffs have not disputed it, that there is no

12

evidence in the record of an intent to conceal anything

13

from claimants.

14

there were ones, were openly discussed between the state

15

agency, were openly discussed between the state agency

16

and SSA, within SSA, and they were debated.

programs are of massive dimension.
QUESTIONS

That is what the basic policy is, as

10

I understand it, that there was a policy that determined

11

a great number of decisions, and the decisionmakers

didn't tell the people they were ruling against why they

13

were doing it.

14

Am I wrong?

MR. KNEEDLER*

But that — they wrote a

15

decision that explained they had arrived at the

16

conclusion the person could work, but there is no

17

requirement that a decisionmaker has to give the basic

18

outlines of his decision, but there is no requirement

19

that he explain all of tha thought processes that h',>

goes through, in the same way that there is no

requirement that the District Court fully explain every

step that it went through.

from others who are responsible for running the program,

21

and they follow those steps routinely, and a claimant

22

who gets a decision that is based on that policy, if he

decides not to appeal it, just like in any other system,

he has to be taken to have made a knowing decision not

I thought what Judge Weintein was

was never made known to the claimants.

The problem in cnis case is that the rationale

of the Court of Appeals is not premised on the existence

of a secret policy in the sense that there was

affirmative concealment of anything.

7

Court’s premise of tolling in this case on the 60-day

the state agency's approach to this remained

undisclosed, that the 60-day time limit would run

11

apparently for as long as the policy remained

undisclosed.

13

If this had been adopted in 1976 and came to

14

light in 1982, undec the Court of Appeals rationale,

15

there is no reason why those old claims could not be

16

reopened, and this, it seems to us, is fundamentally

17

inconsistent with the explicit judgment of Congress in

U

Section 405(g) recognized by this Court in Califano

versus Sanders, that a claimant has only 60 days within

question of mental impairments.

focused, and I would like to read the House report to

2

you, that serious gaestions have been raised by federal

3

courts, professionals in the field of psychiatry and

4

SSA’s listing of mental impairments and the

6

appropriateness of SSA’s current methods of assessing

7

residual functional capacity and predicting ability to

8

work, in individuals with mental impairments.

9

the precise issue raised in this case.

That is

What Congress

10

did when it enacted Section 5 of the 1984 Act was to

11

extend a moratorium the Secretary had previously adopted

12

to direct her to finish something that she had

13

undertaken on her own, which was to reexamine the

14

criteria for evaluating mental impairments and to

15

reevaluate the listings.

16

filed, the Secretary had undertaken those measures.

17

And even before this suit was

Then what Congress did to provide a remedy for

18

people who might have been wrongfully denied benefits

19

under the prior approach, it said that any claimant

20

whose claim was denied after March 1 of 1981 could

21

reapply for benefits and have his claim reexamined under

22

the new standards the Secretary promulgated, which were

23

finally promulgated last August.

24

this case whose claia was denied after March 1,

25

which was as far back as Congress chose to go, can

So any class member in

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 623-9300

1981,

reapply for benefits under the special regime that
Congress established for dealing with this problem.
Congress did not, however, provide for the
reopening of the past decisions in which those claims
were originally denied.

Congress, in order to do that,

it would be necessary for a court to excuse the failure
of class members to seek farther review within 50 days
and to exhaust their remedies.
Congress knew how to do that, too, when it
wanted to do so, when it wanted to excuse claimants from
their failure to comply with the rules, because in
Section 2 of the 1984 Act, Congress took class actions
as they were then existing when it enacted that Act on
the medical improvement question and said all such class
members can be sent back to the Secretary to have their
claims reevaluated, whether or not they satisfied the
60-day rule or the exhaustion requirement.

So Congress

looked at -hat problem and took that approach.

It did

not take that approach uniar Section 5 of the 1984 Act.

that Congress has stepped in and addressed what it

10

perceived was perhaps a systemic problem I think makes

11

it unnecessary for the Court to have to fashion,

12

judicially fashion rales of exhaustion or 60 days here.

13

I think we are entitled to take Congress at its word in

14

doing this.

As I say, the Court of Appeals rationale was

simply that what the state agency decisionmakers did was

not affirmatively disclosed.

is not published in the Federal Register excuses

quite an openended principle, and we think it would
really leal to havoc in the administration of the Social
Security Act.
By the same token, the Court of Appeals*
approach to the exhaustion question was not at all
dependent upon the notion of a secret policy in this
case.

The Court of Appeals adopted what it called an ad

hoc balancing approach to the question of exhaustion
rather than adhering to the strict final decision
requirement where julicial review is available only
after a hearing, which suggests that everything that
would be resolved in a hearing has to be resolved before
judicial review is there, and the only exception this
Court has recognized to that was in the case — was in
Matthews versus

Jldridge, which precisely fits the

three-part test for the Cohen doctrine for the
collateral order doctrine under 1291 which uses the same
final decision language.

Trfe have a very — from this

Court's decisions and what Congress has said, a very
precise jurisdictional regime that is fair and
reasonable for the claimants.
The Court of Appeals approach would greatly
undo that.
I would like to reserve the balance of my

ORAL ARGUMENT BY FREDERICK A.O. SCHWARZ, JR., ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4

MR. SCHWARZ;

Me. Chief Justica, and may it

5

please the Court, what happened here in the Social

6

Security Administration was highly disturbing, as was

7

found by the courts below in a series of detailed

8

findings which tha government did not challenge on

9

appeal and did not raise in their cert petition to this

10
11

Court.
The guestion for this Court, howsver, is

12

whether relief can be awarded responsive to conduct

13

unbefitting an agency of the United States without

14

opening the door to an excessive or premature use of the

15

courts in derogation of the usually appropriate

16

administrative scheme of review.

17

And so I want to start by describing a very

18

narrow rule where full exhaustion is excused, a rule

19

that arises from what one hopes irs the unique or at

20

least truly extraordinary circumstances of this case.

21

Then I want to show why this narrow exception fits

22

directly within what this Court has said, particularly

23

in Eldridge and Ringer.

24
25

The principle test of waiver of exhaustion
suggested by this case is indeed narrow because the

capacity, and they simply passed a per sa rule or

adopted secretly a per se rule that truncated the

Page 39A of the appendix to the cart petition found "the

5

the filing of this lawsuit and after a preliminary

Suppose — I would like to change the facts a

require at the initial decisionmaking stage.

only to get that in compliance with the regulations if

Let me tell you, I am
and I am arguing this
Let me say why

10

we are interested in the case, why we joined it.

11

suppose most poignantly is the finding that was made by

12

Judge Weinstein that 40 percent of the homeless people

13

who are now sleeping on the streets of New York*

14

increasingly making our city look like Calcvltta, are

15

people who were terminated from the — mentally

16

disturbed persons with severe mental disabilities who

17

were terminated by the Social Security Administration

18

per this policy.

19

I

So, we have an interest in stopping this

20

policy.

21

judgment here is affirmed, the claimants — by the way,

22

they don’t automatically get benefits.

23

still establish the right under a fair proceeding

24

without the tilting of the balance that was improperly

25

and secretly put in by the Secretary.

Now, we also have a fiscal interest.

They have to

If they prevail, we will be entitled to some

portion of the back benefits that they receive to the

3

extent that the city or the state nuae good our

obligation to care for the needy, which calls for us to

5

spend less money, and it is far less adequate than the

federal benefits under the Social Security

Administration.

You feel you can move in and pick

10

MR. SCHWARZ:

That, of course, would remain to

11

be decided by the District Court as a matter of the

12

remedial details of the decree.

13

there has been no decision to that effect, Justice

14

Blackmun, but I think we would have a claim upon those

15

moneys, and the claimants would have a claim on the

16

residue, the amount that is greater than the moneys

17

which were reimbursed

18

And I don’t think —

to the claimants by the city.

But as T say, that has not been resolved in a

19

case, and first a;d foremost, our interest is that our

20

people not be thrown out of a government program and as

21

was found by Judge Weinstein thrown out on the streets

retroactive payments.

Here again, if anything, our case

is stronger on the point than was Eldridge’s.

The harm

here is not just a Cj-airn of damage or a colorable
assertion.

Here there were explicit actual uncontested

findings that this class of mentally disturbed claimants
was devastating, some even becoming suicidal, some
indeed committing suicide by the improper denials, and
there were uncontested findings that because of their
condition, their mentally disturbed condition, they were
particularly likely to be deterred from pursuing their
claim further through the administrative appeal process
by the crushing news of the denial, and of course if
they did pursue it further, as Judge Weinstein found,
even though some of them would win, there was
nonetheless a taint to the record that went to the
ALJ's.
To insist on exhaustion here would not only be
inconsistent in principle with the legal claims we •
rai.se.

It would also in practice insulate from any

remedy a policy that caused real injuries to thousands
of mentally ill persons, and none of the benefits that
can be achieved from exhaustion as defined in Salfi, as
earlier articulated in McJart, could have been achieved
in this case through further exhaustion.
So, with no benefits from exhaustion, with
38
ALDEkaON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., VvaoHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

substantial and irreparable injury from exhaustion, and
with a crucial collateral issue, we squarely fit the
Eldrid ge standard.

Und nothing which you said in Ringer

changes this analysis.

First,

Ringer was recognized as

being at bottom a claim for benefits, and that is laid
out at some length.

But here, another point about

Ringer and the issues, the holding by the Secretary
there or the statement by the Secretary that BCBR
surgery was not reimbursible is a kind of matter which,
as this Court said, is clearly discretionary, clearly
within the discretion of the Secretary to decide whether
a particular medical procedure is reasonable and
necessary under the \ct.
It is not within the discretion of the
Secretary or any other government official to secretly
violate their own regulations and deprive people of
their rights in that fashion.

It is not normal and

within the administrative pow;*r to say thit claimants
will not be given a meaningful first stare evaluation,
and to do so secretly, and I stress again that in Ringer
it was an appropriate medical judgment that was made.
Here, the medical judgment had been made in
the regulations as to what has happened, meant to
happen.

There were meant to be five stages.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

would like to make several points about the secret
policy point.
First, this is a time limit for a suit against
the government.

This Court has male clear that such a

limit could be toll, if at all, only upon a showing of
affirmative misconduct by the government.

Here the

District Court did not even reach the question of
whether the APA required these internal memoranda to be
published.

There has bean no finding that the statute

was violated by not giving more complete decisions,
explanations of the decisions to include this particular
approach.

Respondents raised that issue for the first

time in this Court.
Third, the named plaintiffs in this case all
— seven of the eight all went to the ALJ.

They were

not deterred or misled by the government from seeking
further review.

And fourth, the rnnamed claimants, none

of them invoked the procedure Congress has set out for
extending the time limit wnen equity warrants it.
