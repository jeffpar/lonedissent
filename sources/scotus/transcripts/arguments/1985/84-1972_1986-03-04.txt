ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. ROTHFELDi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, the issue in this case is a narrow

11

one, wnether a

12

and backed by a contingent note provided by the bank's

13

customer represents a deposit that is insured by the

14

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

15

standby letter of credit issued by a bank

While this guesticn obviously is a technical

16

one, reduced to its essentials, the issue here is

17

actually very straightforward, and can be resolved

18

simply by bearing in mind the central purpose of the

19

deposit insurance program, protecting funds that

20

depositors entrust to banks.

21

This case is typical of commercial

22

transactions that make use of so-called standby letter

23

of credit to guarantee credit by one of the parties, and

24

a look at the facts of the transaction here may help put

25

the issue in focus.

The care began when

the Orion Manufacturing

2

Corporation arranged to purchase materials from the

3

respondent.

4

materials when theywere delivered, Orion obtained a

5

standby letter of credit from

6

the benefit of respondent.

To guarantee that it would pay for the

tie Penn Square Bank

for

This letter of credit, like all letters of

7

-,CE

8

credit,

functioned as a guarantee mechanism, and worked

9

very much like a line of credit.

Under the letter,.Penn

10

Square was obligated to pay respondent upon tne receipt

11

of respondent’s signed statement that Orion hadn't paid

12

its bills to respondent when those bills came due.

13

As security for Penn Square, Orion gave the
i

14

bank a contingent so-called backup note in the amount of

15

the letter of credit which

17

under the letter of credit.

18

t

the bank would drew upon for

Although this note was labeled a promissory

19

note and on its face appeared uncontingent, both Orion

20

and Penn Square understood that nothing would be

21

considered due on the note and the note would bear no

22

interest unless and until the bank was forced to pay

23

respondent under the letter of credit.

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Rothfeld, are you

suggesting in your description of this note that it was

MR. RQTHFELD:

You are saying that this particular

note was not a promissory note within the language of

the statute?

--

Is that because there was a side

understanding setting forth certain contingencies?

That is correct, although

MR. ROTHFFLD*

Essentially that is correct,

Justice 0‘Connor.
QUESTION*

12

Does it make any difference at all

13

whether the note bore interest or not, or was in fact

14

easily negotiable because of its lack of interest?
MR. ROTHFELD:

15

I think that the note here

16

functioned simply as an elaborate reimbursement

agreement, but the note diin't represent any actual

But I just don’t think that reads

the statute very accurately, because up to the proviso

it talks about money or its equivalent, and then it says

provided that without limiting the generality of the

term money any such encounters must be regarded as

13

evidencing the receipt of the equivalent of money when

credit or issuing checks — in exchange for checks or

19

MR. ROTHFSLD:

I think that it is fairly clear

20

from the background of this deposit definition that the

21

FDIC put that proviso in its original regulatory

22

definition of deposit, and Congress borrowed it and put

23

it in 1813(L)(1) simply to make it clear that deposits

24

include things in addition to cash, that anything of

25

value that is given to and entrusted to a bank that Is

put at risk and is lest when the bank fails is entitled

2

to the benefits of deposit insurance.

3

And that is why it listed checks and drafts,

4

which create unconditional liability which are as good

5

as cash to the depositor, an promissory notes were put

6

in for the same purpose, because the depositor who gives

7

an uncontingent promissory note to the bank may as well

8

have given the bank cash.
And in fact, as ws explain in cur brief,

9

in

10

the 1930’s, at the time when this original definition

11

was first written, it was understood that for a variety

12

of purposes the term promissory note should not be

13

deemed to include contingent notes.

14

used such a definition for its discount purposes, for

example.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

2

HR. SLATTERY;

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

3

please the Court, I would like to begin, if I may, with

4

an answer to a question* Justice O’Connor posed to the

5

Solicitor General.

6

You asked, I believe. Justice O'Connor,

7

whether the statutory words, the person obtaining any

8

such credit or instrument, refers to the bank's customer

9

or tc the beneficiary of the letter of credit.

The

10

words refer to the bank's customer, Orion, and the words

11

mean in respondent's view the person at whose request

12

the tank issues the letter of credit to the beneficiary.

13

And the primacy or secondary liability

14

reference, of course, refers to the customer's liability

15

on the promissory note that he has delivered to the

16

bank .

17

Further, in regard to a question that Justice

18

Flack nun asked about the status of S. 750, which has

19

recently been introduced by Senator Jake Garn at the

20

FDIC's request and is now before the Senate Committee on

21

Housing, Banking, and Urban Affairs.
I believe that the text of that bill removes

22

23

all letters of credit from tne protection of the deposit

24

insurance program, not merely on funded letters of

25

credit.

I recall reading an official version of the

bill, in i I also recall that the trail publication that

2

the FDIC cites in its reply brief letter of credit

If memory serves me correctly, T believe the

unfunded letters of credit, but all letters of credit

The FDIC —

QUESTION;

10

Hr. Slattery, do you think that the

11

FDIC*s long-standing decision not to charge insurance

12

premiums, in effect, for unfunded or for standby letters

13

of credit constitutes an administrative interpretation

14

of the Act which we owe some deference in resolving this

15

question ?

16

HR. SLATTERY*

I do not, Your ^onor.

The FDIC

17

has made the statement in its opening brief that it has

18

never assessed Letters of credit of the sort *'iat were

19

issued to respondent in this case, nor has it ever paid

20

claims on letters of credit of this sort.

21

22

the failure by the FDIC to assess deposit insurance

23

premiums is purposeful or unconsidered.

24

was unconsidered because I cannot believe that a

QUESTION;

7

Bat it has to be a derision, in

NR. SLATTERY;

As I say. Your Honor, it is

8

problematic.

It appears that there was some vague and

11

deposit insurance programs while commercial letters of

12

credit may have been.

13

made in the reply brief.

a basis upon which to distinguish funded from unfunded

letters of credit.

That, at least, is the suggestion
That is a distinction without

It appears from Assessment Decision Number

19

109, for example, that virtually all letters of credit

20

are unfunded, commercial and standby.

21

Decision Number 109 -- I am paraphrasing, but I believe

22

my paraphrase is very close to the actual words of the

23

regulation — the FDIC stated that commercial letters of

24

credit normally are not sold for cash, but are issued

25

against an agreement to reimburse the bank, for drafts

The FDIC goes on to say in that Assessment

2
3

Decision Number 109 that if that reimburse.<ien t agreement

4

dees not constitute a promissory note, then in that

5

event the letter of credit is not accessible as an

insured deposit, the inescapable conclusion being only

7

this, «hat the statute says, that if the agreement is a

8

promissory note, then the letter of credit is insured

9

and is assessed.
I note also, Justice O'Connor, in further

10
11

response to your question, that the distinction between

12

funded and unfunded letters of credit has been drawn by

13

the FDIC in other contexts where at least prior to this

Your

it becomes a depositor at the time it turns over the

instrument, the note.

Is that correct?

MR. SLATTERY*

12

No, Your Honor, that is not

correct.

gave the FDIC only the power to expand the scope of

A couple of points. Your Honor,

2

which I will try to make quick.

3

crucial question, the meaning of a promissory note in a

case, that clearly must be defined by reference to

5

federal law, and it must be determined in light of the

6

meaning of the statute and the Congressional purpose.

7

It can't be enough if something is a promissory note

8

that it has the term promissory note written across the

9

top.

10

QUESTION*

as to the

Is the note that we are talking

11

about, is that the note that appears at Page 27 of the

12

joint appendix?

13

MR. ROTHFELP:

That is correct , Your Honor,

14

which — and the note is characterized explicitly as a

15

backup note to the Latter of credit, which clearly

16

indicates that it is to be drawn upon only when the

17

letter of credit is itself drawn upon.

18

It is impossible to imagine why Cong*:ess would

19

have wanted to insure a letter of credit that is backed

20

by this sort of contingent --

21

QUESTION*

On that point,

what is your

that.

He refers to them on Page 15 of his brief.
MR. ROTHFELDi

2

Wall, I should make two points

3

in response to that. Your Honor.

First, so far as

4

1813(L)(1) itsalf is concerned, which is the part of the

5

statute that is at issue here, everything is defined in

6

terms of money or its equivalent, and it is very

7

difficult to imagine why Congress would have wanted to

8

list something like an incontingent note to say that it

9

must bs regarded as Bogey or its eguivalent.
As to the instruments that the respondent has

10
11

listed,

those all appear in Section 1813 (L) (4) of the

12

statute, which is the only part cf the deposit

13

definition that is not put in terms of money or its

14

equivalent.
QUESTIONS

15

But they all suggest that the

16

purpose of this statute was to extend credit to a number

17

of bank creditors for whom no deposit in the

18

old-fashioned senee had been made, that he fits into

1P

that general class, and therefore fits into the overall

20

Congressional purpose.

21

argument.

22

MR. ROTHFELD;

That is as I understand his

Again, I think

there are'

23

several points to make in response to that.

First, the

24

types of instruments listed in Section 1813(1X4) are

25

all things for which the bank generally has received

And again. Congress singled out those types of

3
4

bank instruments sari is cashier's checks as the only

5

things which were not defined in terms of money or its

6

equivalent received or held by the bank.

think, to the extent that they they don't f3ll into the

a special separate category, and Congress recognized
