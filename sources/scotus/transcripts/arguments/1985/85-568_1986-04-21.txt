Appropriately enough, it is a series of state

all FEBC-regulated power supply costs in the retail

MR. LEE*

Where is Tapoco located, Mr. Lee?
A

short distance over the North

Carolina-Tennessee border,

QUESTIONi

MR. LEE*

in eastern Tennessee.

How far from the border?
I would say. Justice Eehnquist, on

7

the order of 50, 50 Biles, but I could be off by a few

8

yards.

9

During the period at issue,

Nantahala and

10

Tapoco operated under two contracts that were filed with

11

FERC as rate schedules.

12

New Fontana Agreement, TVA incorporates the

13

hydroelectric generation of these two companies into its

14

system and then delivers back electricity which is

15

lesser in quantity,

Under one of them, called the

but more dependable.

These NFA entitlements from TVA were divided

16
17

between Nantahala and Tapoco by a

1971 apportionment

18

agreement.

19

Nantahala*s entitlements had been sufficient for its

20

customers'

Prior to that time, that is prior to

needs.

1971,

Bat since then, Nantahala, like

f

21

Tapoco before it, has had to purchase additional power

22

froi TVA.

23

And these TVA power purchases cost more than

24

three times as much as the hydro entitlements.

25

for each company, the power supply cost is a blend cost,

So that

whom are in North Carolina,

10

Hew much of this lew cost entitlement power

and hew much tc Tapocc’s

customers in Tennessee?

11

In one sense, the case varies from the usual

12

pattern because it involves the allocation of low cost

13

FERC-regulated power, where in each of the Narragansett

14

and Northern States line of cases, the issue was high

15

cost.
And yet, high cost power is also at issue

16
17

here, because for both companies and both states the

18

real cost is the mix of the entitlements and the

19

purchases.

QUESTION*

Well,

Hr. Lee, what’s the filed

rate that the North Carolina Commission is bound by?
NR. LEE*

The filed rate in this instance was

23

the New Fontana Agreement, supplemented by the 1971

24

allocation.

25

That is the filed rate.

When it hadn’t been made?
Yes.

I mean, it just — there’s

something missing here.

9

ME. LEE»

I appreciate the opportunity to

10

clear that up.

12

it was binding as a filed rate so long as it was not

14

Since it had been filed, under this

So that the North Carolina Utilities

Commission during the interim period between the filing

date and any modification made to it had available to it

17

two options.

18

was simply to wait, to abstain and wait until FERC

19

actually made the allocation.

20

It could have followed either one.

One

The other option was to go ahead and deal with

21

all of the issue except the power supply costs and

22

regard itself as being bound by the power supply that

Clearly what it was tcund by was the filed

3

QUESTION;

was actually modified.

So it’s your view that North

4

Carolina was bound by that apportionment agreement, even

5

though FEBC later changed?

6

MB. LEE*

That is correct.

And then once FERC

7

made the change, then North Carolina could similarly go

8

back and make the same change that was reflected in the
►
FERC agreement.
And that is the thrust of Narragansett

9
10

and Northern States and these various state cases.

11

only exception is tha Nort.n Carolina Supreme Court

12

decision in this case.

13

The

14

O’Connor, by departing from that procedure was to take

QUESTION;

Well,

what if Nantahala had gone

19

cut and purchased high cost power at a rate on file with

20

FERC, which the North Carolina Utilities Commission

21

subsequently decided Nantahala had imprudently and

22

unnecessarily purchased?

23

SR. LEEi

And why is this different?

It’s different for this reason, that

24

that simply is not the fact in this case, and there was

25

no issue of whether this particular purchase or this

2

cost power, was or was not prudent

3

The question that you have just raised is the

4

question that is raised by the Pike County and Sinclair

5

Machine Products case.

6

this Court need not resolva, namely in those instances

7

where FEEC dees not actually face and decide the

8

question of hew they should be allocated, where FERC

9

could have decided it but did not, is that then binding

11

That is a difficult issue that

on the states?
That's a difficult question and a close one,

12

but it need net be resolved in this case, because ir

13

this case the only issue is how should these

14

entitlements be allocated.

15

and under the Narragansett and Northern States line cf

16

cases that decision is binding on FERC.

17

FERC has made that decision,

It is also our position that the economic

18

preference that North Carolina has erected for itself by

19

sweetening its mix of the entitlements between the

20

purchases and the entitlement power is a violation cf

21

the commerce clause.

22

commerce clause issue because cf the availability of a

23

statutory ground for the decision, and that statutory

24

ground is the availability of this Narragansett-Northern

25

States doctrine.

But this Court need not reach the

(202) 628-9300

1

The Appellees really do net argue, cr they dc

2

not purport to argue, witn the basic Narragansett

3

principle, but they contend that it's inapplicable here

4

for a variety of reasons, none of which is on the mark.

5

And I would like to examine just very briefly the three

6

assertions that appear with greatest frequency in that

7

re spec t.

8
9

Probably the most frequent is that the FERC
rate schedules, the NFA as supplemented by the

10

apportionment agreement, is not a proper basis for

11

making cost allocations, because that agreement is the

12

product of Alcoa’s alleged domination of Nantahala and

13

Tapoko.

14

The short answer to that allegation is that it

15

comes too late.

16

rejected it, and FERC’s position was sustained by the

17

Fourth Circuit in an appeal taken by these Appellees.

18
19

F2RC squarely considered it and

2

clear that he was intervening on behalf of interests cf

3

all of Nantahala’s retail customers.
And then, j)lice FERC had made its decision, the

North Carolina Attorney General appealed to the Fourth

decision was upheld and North Carolina can’t challenge

that.

MR. LEE:

And what it concluded was that the NFA was in

21

all respects fair, but that an adjustment needed to be

22

made to the 1971 apportionment agreement, and it made

23

the adjustment that in FERC’s judgment was necessary in

24

order to constitute just and reasonable rates.

25

Once FERC reached that determination as to

2

Regulatory Commission, than the Federal Power

3

Commission, because of the fact that this Court in

4

Attleboro had held that the states did not have it.
In the event that the states could than come

5

6

along and, once these power supply costs had been

7

deterained at wholesale, could say,

8

them at the retail rate, it would simply permit the

9

states to do by indirection what they cannot do

we disagree with

10

directly, and thit is to ia affect overturn FERC's

11

determination for the only purpose that really matters.
The purpose that really matters for the

12
13

allocation of these entitlements and therefore the

14

allocation of the purchases is in the setting of retail

15

rates.
As Tennessee points out in its amicus brief,

16
17

if North Carolina can do what it has purported to do,

18

what it has attempted to do in this case,

19

the amount of its entitlements to what it needs, rather

20

than to FERC's determinations, there is no reason that

21

Tennessee couldn't do the same.

That is the guesticn cf the

procedure that can be used,

that is whether it can

whether it can use this

whether North Carolina can pierce the corporate veil is

irrelevant to this case.

My answer to that is that the guestion of

It adds nothing to the analysis, for this
reason.

said that the State Commission was not questioning the

2

FERC filed allocation of low cost power, that is tc say

3

the teras on which Nantahala acquired power at

4

wholesale, but was merely determining what ccsts could

5

properly be impose! on retail customers.

6

It analogized cases where state utility

7

commissions have accepted the wholesale cost, but found

8

that a particular wholesale cost was offset by savings

9

elsewhere or was, as in for example the case of a

10

research cost, not a

particular cost that ought to be

imposed on particular retail customers, or cases where

state commissions have found that power purchase ccsts

were unreasonable oecause power could have been acquired

more cheaply from a different available source.

What it did

3ne of the things, one of the parts of the

lexicon of this case that

3

the Appellants ace constantly referring to Alcoa as a

customer of Tapoco.

I

you

should be aware of is that

It is a customer of Tapoco, but

5

primarily in this case it is a utility company.

6

Certainly in the state of North Carolina it’s a public

7

utility, and it owns two public utility subsidiaries,

8

and as sari is the sole stncknoliec in those.

9

Now, was there any reason for inquiring into

10

Nantahala’s prudence in letting itself be manipulated

11

the way it could not otherwise do, being wholly owned by

12

the master Alcoa?

Let me quote to you from what cur

If you want to put that in the context of the

MR. CRISP,:

Hew, the tattle that I alluded tc,

5

hydroelectric power, gargantuan quantities of which are

6

required to smelt aluminum.

Alcoa came

And they suddenly ran into a phenomenon that

8

is not indigenous to the mountain people cf Tennessee

9

and North Carolina.

I think it pervades the country.

10

People don't want their land dammed and lakes built on

11

then.

12

out.

They don't want privately and voluntarily to sell

So what did Alcoa do?

13

First of all, it bought

14

a utility.

15

changed to Carolina Aluminam.

16

was changed tc Yadkin, Inc.

17

and farther away from tie concept of a utility.

18

yet, it was Carolina Aluminum who sold, transferred, the

19

two dams in<North Carolina to Tapoco.

20

That was Tallassee.

What they did,

Tallassee's name was
Carolina Aluminum's name

See, we're getting farther
And

they created these subsidiaries

21

with the power of eminent domain, and they net only

22

exercised that power with respect to condemnation

23

proceedings, they pervasively exercised it in

24

threatening people to give up their land who otherwise

25

wouldn't do it.

\m anier the guise of a public utility they

2

then went in and acquired the rights to build the dams,

generate the power,

spinning off these facilities*

to Tapoco, drained all of the lew cost power to Alcoa in

Tanaassaa.

and then by corporate manipulation,

And the higher cost power was left to the

people who were served in North Carolina, and it would

have been true if they had been serving across the line

10

in Tennessee as far as that is concerned, which we did

11

for a while.

12

The wrongness of that was first recognized by
