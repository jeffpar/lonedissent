MR. KLEINi

7

Mr. Chief Justice, end may it please the Court:

8

We are faced today with twc issues cf great

9

import.

Thank you.

The first issue is whether the voluntariness of

10

a confession is a question cf fact to which this Court

11

and lower federal courts must defer.

12

issue is whether the Petitioner’s confession was

13

involuntarily obtained by police practices which

14

operated to overbear his will.

15

And the second

We submit that the Court of Appeals’ use of

16

the presumption of correctness deprived

17

his statutory rioht to federal plenary judicial review,

18

and if this Court affirms the decision below, it will

19

displace the ultimate authority to decide the questions

20

of constitutionality of confession from federal courts

21

where Congress placed it and where this Court has

22

consistently recognized

With regard to this issue, it is crucial that

24

we look to the nature of the voluntariness inquiry

25

itself and to the nature of the federal courts’ role in

MR. KLEIN*

10

Why does the question of whether

Wnen you are dealing

with

11

voluntariness of a confession and you have a defendant

12

or a petitioner in front of you, you cannot deal with

13

the assessment of credibility and demeanor at a closed,

inherently secret and inherently coercive setting such

15

as an interrogation.

that the cases I have referred tc depend on the fact

that the witnesses were present before the judge who

I think that Congress has

dealing with -- excuse me, I lost myself for a second --

13

voluntariness of a confession, that state courts do not

14

offer the proper institutional setting fer final

15

adjudication of federal rights, and that in the past and

16

the potential is still there for state courts to defeat

17

federal claims by failing to, as the Court said in

18

Culombe, to draw the inferences that the historical

19

facts compel.

Is it Culombe v. Connecticut?
I guess.
And how many Justices of the Court

NR. KLFINj

I thought it was three or four.

6

Certainly I think the concern cf Congress has

7

been that the state court, state courts are not

8

insulated enough from local community sentiment, from

9

the question of guilt and innocence itself, and that a

10

further proceeding would be needed in this court to

11

protect,

to ultimately vindicate those rights.
Now, if you lock at the problem here, if

Mr. Klein, many of

court voluntariness findings seemed to be based on some

kind of distrust of state court findings in general.

MR. KLEIN;

I do not think that the fair

21

these practices did not operate to overbear petitioner’s

23

wanted tc note that this Court has observed that illegal

24

and unconstitutional practices get their first footing

25

by silent approaches and slight deviations from the

accepted legal procedures, and I think this case is a

2

perfect example of where those silent approaches and

3

slight deviations can lead.

4

At the outset we did note that there was no

5

question but that petitioner had received his warnings,

6

and we are not contending that he didn't understand

7

those warnings when they were given.

8

contending is that we have to look at what the

9

interrogator did after the warnings were given, and I

What we are

10

think it's clear that the entire thrust cf the

11

interrogation was to divert petitioner from the reality

12

of the criminal justice system, to undermine any of the*

13

warnings that had been given previously, and to

14

ultimately overbear petitioner's will.

15

The detective employed a series of lies,

16

deceptions and promises during a constant psychological

17

assault assuring petitioner over and over and over again

18

that it was the detective's job to get him heip, that

19

petitioner was not a criminal, that he was not

20

responsible for what had happened, and that he should

21

receive help instead of

punishment.

MS. P&SKOWs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

12

Even under an independent review standard, Mr.

13

Miller’s 1973 confession to the brutal murder of 17 year

14

old Deborah Margolin should be found voluntary, and so

15

it v=s by both the New Jersey Supreme Court and the

16

Third Circuit.

17

However, this Court need never reach that

18

issue because as respondents submit, under

19

deference should be accorded to the factual findings of

20

the state court, including, as in this case, the factual

21

finding concerning Miller’s state of mind, that is, that

22

his will was not overborne.
