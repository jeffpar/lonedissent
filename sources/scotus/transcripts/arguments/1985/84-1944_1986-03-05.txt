ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

MR. LAUBERs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courti
This case is here on direct appeal, somewhat

10

unusual for a tax case, because the district court

11

declared a prevision of the Revenue Code

12

unconstitutional as a retroactive law that deprives

13

Appellees of property without due process.

14

brief on the merits Appellees, while not abandoning this

15

constitutional theory, seem to place greater reliance

16

upon the statutory construction argument, a variant of

17

which they presented below, bat which the district court

18

did not pass upon.

In their

19

Before talking about either of these

20

arguments, I'd like to explain briefly how the

21

challenged statute works, which is a little bit

22

complicated in some ways.

23

Section 210(c) of the Revenue Code, which Congress

24

enacted in 1976.

25

The challenged statute is

This is one example of many transitional rules
3

(202) 628-9300

that Congress from time to time puts into the Revenue
Code to bridge the gap between an older statutory regime
and an amended regime.

In 1976 Congress overhauled the

estate and gift tax juite romprehensively .

One thing

Congress did was to effect an overall reduction of
estate taxes, particularly for smaller estates.
Congress also brought about a degree of
integration between the gift tax and the estate tax.
For present purposes, the most relevant integrating
thing Congress did was to repeal a pair of exemptions
that were available under the old law — they were
basically deductions — and

replace them with a single

unified credit under the new law.
Under the old law, a taxpayer during life was
entitled to exempt a total of $30,000 of his property in
gift form from the gift tax.

That was in addition to

the annual exclusion of $3,000 per donee.

The doner was

free to claim this 530,000 exemption in whole or in
part, whenever he waited it.
At his death, his estate was then entitled to
exempt p60,000 of property from the estate tax, and the
ability to claim that was independent of the donor's
inter vivos claim of the gift tax exemption.
In 1976 Congress abolished both of those
exemptions aifd replaced them with a single unified

1

credit, which was designed to replace both the gift tax

2

$3,000 exemption and the estate tax 560,000 exemption.

3

And the new credit was to be available against either or

4

both of these taxes as first incurred.

That meant that

5

somebody could use part of the unified credit for gifts

6

during life and what he didn't use would be available to

7

be used against the estate tax by his executor after his

8

death.

9

Congress realized that there was a problem of

10

continuity here, because some people would have claimed

11

the £30,000 gift tax exemption in whole or in part

12

during life for gifts they made prior to 1977.

13

effective date of the new law was January 1st, 1977.

14

QUESTIONS

The

Mr. Lauber, had he waited until

15

January 2, *77, he'd get the full — we wouldn't have a

16

case here, would we?

17

MR. LAUBER*

That's right, because after the

18

new law was enacted that abolished the old gift tax

19

exemption, and everything was then governed by the

20

unified credit.

21

2, he would have had to use up part of his unified

22

credit or pay gift tax on the transfer.

23

25

So if he had made the gifts on January

So if he gave away $30,000 on January 2, he
would have had to use up —

unified credit in order to avoid paying gift tax.

QUESTION*

He'd have had to use it all up to

the tax.

MR. LAUBER»

I think not all, because the

8

credit is dollar for dollar against the tax, whereas the

9

old exemption you only get a number of cents on the

10
11

dollar equal to your marginal rate.
Anyway, Congress saw there was a problem of

12

continuity because if people who previously had claimed

13

and been allowed their $30,000 gift tax exemption got

14

the full unified credit, which was meant to be a

15

replacement for the old exemption, they'd get the same

16

thing twice.

17

So to prevent this problem Congress enacted

18

the challenged provision. Section 210(c) of the code.

19

And it provides that the unified credit available to a

20

person or his estate would be reduced by an amount equal

21

to 20 percent of the aggregate amount allowed as a

22

specific exemption under prior law for gifts made after

23

the day the conference committee approved the new bill

24

and before the end of tve year.

25

The^purposa of the provision was to prevent
6

(202) 628-9300

what this Court has sailed a rush to the door by people
trying to hurry up and make a lot of gifts at the end cf
the year in the hope of doubIs-dipping by getting both
the old exemption plus a full new credit.

The reason

why Congress picked 20 percent as the multiplier to work
out this reduction isn't clear, but it's generally
thought Congress figured that was equal to the average
effective gift tax rate, and therefore — in fact, gift
tax rates ranged from about three percent to 58
percent.

But Congress apparently thought that the

average effective rate paid by the nation's taxpayers as
a whole on their gifts was about 20 percent and
therefore that if you took thit out of the unified
credit you would be compensating for the tax henefit on
average realized by most people who claimed the old
ex emption.
QUESTIONS

You say it isn't clear.

Why

wouldn't something like that be in the legislative
history?

Well, it really, you would think

it's something —

How, the facts of this case are that the

11

1976, which was during the transitional period covered

12

by Section 210(c).

QUESTION:

Suppose the law had never been

changed, and under the old law what would happen in a

gift in contemplation of death where somebody made a

11

gift in contemplation of death and took his exemption

12

and paid some tax and then he had to pay his estate tax,

13

too?

14

MR. LAUBERs

Well, under the old law, if he

15

had made the gift in contemplation of death and say he

16

claimed the £30,000 exemption and paid no tax —

17

QUESTION*

.8

MR. LAUBERi

Yes.
You than have the property

19

included in the estate, subject to estate tax, and he

20

would basically have wasted the specific exemption,

claimed it, but aside from the time value of money by

deferring the tax he wouldn *t really have gotten a great

tax benefit.

HR. LAUBER*

Then he'd get a credit against

some difference in this case, that he can't be
double-dipping?

He's going to get socked for the amount

of his gifts in his astate tax.
HR. LAUBER;

happened in the prior law. Justice White, that people

21

could waste their exemption, and people could claim a

22

23

could wind up being included in the estate as a gift in

In any of those cases, it would be subject tc
estate tax and he would have wasted his gift tax
exemption.

And there was no change in that from the old

law to

the new law, because what happened under the new

law is

the waste of the old exemption is reflected in

7

the removal of that chunk of the unified credit.

8

QUESTION:

Hell, it just seems to me that

9

because these gifts were included in his estate, he*s

10

not exactly in the same position to have his exemption

11

reduced as somebody who really got the benefit.

12

MR. LAUBER:

Hell, that's the statutory

13

argument that the Appellees make, and perhaps I should

14

just go right into that.

15

You argue

Combining him and the estate as one

21

for the moment.

22

I state it correctly, because it's awfully easy to get

23

confused — under the old law he would have paid no gift

tax, but the amount of the gifts would have been

25

included in his astate tax and he would have paid an

included.

And that tax would have been higher than undeL

4

the new law where he got a 528,000 exemption or credit

5

against the tax as to both of them, is that right?

6

HR. LAUBER*

7

QUESTION*

That’s right.
So the net result is he pays less

8

tax, he and his estate together pay less tax, than wculd

9

have been paid, becaase he paid no gift tax before and

10
11

the estate tax would have been higher?
MR. LAUBER*

If Congress had never amended the

12

law, the figures we’re comparing, what would have

13

happened if he had — if Congress had never changed the

14

law at all, enacted our provision —

15

16

MR. LAUBER*

That’s right.
— the tax under those rates —

these were gifts in contemplation of death.
MR. LAUBER*

Right.

Assuming these same facts

22

and that Congress either did or did not pass the law

23

we’re considering, he paid less tax overall, even with

24

this reduction of $6,000.

QUESTION*

You do agree that it would be

O'Connor, yes.

MR. LAUBERs

14

QUESTIONS

15

and it was allowed.

16

No.

That's right.
— in substance.

MR. LAUBERs

It means allowed,

What the statute says is that

17

you've got to reduce the credit by any amount allowed as

18

a specific exemption under prior law.

19

is, although Mr. Hirschi claimed the exemption and

20

although the Commissioner didn't disallow it, because he

21

accepted the return as filed, in effect or ultimately it

22

was not allowed because under the estate tax they wound

23

up paying estate tax on that property, anyway.

24
25

And their theory

And we think that argument is foreclosed by
this Court's^decision in 1943 in Virginian Hotel, where
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

the Court held that the word "allowed” means claimed by

QUESTION*

7

MR. LAUBER;

Pardon me?
An income tax case?
That was an income tax case.

8

That involved depreciation deductions, where somebody

9

had claimed a depreciation deduction in the earlier year

10

and had a net loss.

11

from the depreciation.

12

So he didn't really get any benefit

And he asserted that the deduction wasn't

13

allowed for depreciation, sc he shouldn't have to reduce

14

his basis in the property on that account.

Court rejected that argument and pointed out that our

tax code has no machinery for havinga formal allowance

of deductions.

Overall, Congress has reduced

But the Court in Virginian Hotel pointed cut

16

that every year the Commissioner gets millions of tax

17

returns that are claiming billions of deductions, and

18

there’s no way the Commissioner tells people, we have

19

allowed your deduction.

20

What happens is that the return is accepted as

21

filed, and that means the deduction is allowed, because

22

the tax is computed on the basis of the return as filed,

including that deduction.

But

The President signed the bill in October and
the return is not due for the calendar quarter until
November 15th.

There’s no showing in the record that

Mr. Hirschi tried to withdraw his gift tax return or
amend it to disclaim the exemption, so he apparently
died content that ha had gotten his exemption.

Now his

heirs and executors have found out that if he hadn't
claimed that and died within three years of making the
gifts, they're worse off.
But that does not mean Mr. Hirschi did not
derive the benefit from the exemption he freely claimed
on that gift tax return.
I guess I should say a word about the
constitutional argument of the holding of the court
below.

We think that that holding is wrong for at least

four reasons.
First of all, as Justice Stevens and I
discussed, it's hard to see how anyone was deprived of
property here by the law.

Mr. Hirchi was deprived of no

property because he paid no gift tax at all, and his
heirs wound up paying a lower estate tax than would have
been true if Congress had not enacted this law.

So it's

hard to see where anyone has been deprived of property
in the least.
Secondly, even if one could find a deprivation

4

That’s because the statute was enacted two
Hirschi’s transfer

And it is true that the law required the

credit available to the estate to be computed by

7

past, but this Court has held that that does not, that

fact, does not make a law retroactive.

Indeed, the

11

events that may have occurred many, many years before

the testator died, as for example in the case of gifts

The mere fact that a

Hr. Sutkowski

ORAL ARGUMENT OF
EDWARD F. SUTKOWSKI, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. SUTKOWSKI*

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court!
I'd like to address your attention to page 2
of the Government's brief# which near the bottom
summarizes their position and I think will make the
decision in this case rather straightforward.
Specifically# the Government proposes that!
"Rather, the unifiei crelit in such
circumstances" — relating to the transaction in this
case — "was required to be reduced to reflect the
transfer tax benefit" —
QUESTION*

What page are you reading from?

MR. SUTKOWSKIi

Page 2 of the Government's

brief *
— "to reflect the transfer tax benefit that
the transferor had already garnered."
Several questions have been raised by the
Court with respect to that benefit# and counsel has
referred to the Estate of Penick case, the Court of
Claims case which is offered in supoort of the
Government's -^position .
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPa..., INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

,102) 628-9300

In that case, the Court of Claims held that
the taxpayer in essentially similar circumstances,
although the taxpayer in Renick had made the gift on
December 30 of the year, that is to say after the date
of enactment, as contrasted with the taxpayer in this
case who made the gifts prior to the date of enactment
but after the applicable committee reports had been
published.
The Court of Claims held that it appeared that
the taxpayer in Renick would benefit from the $30,000
exclusion.

In any event, the single item of legislative

history turning on the passing use of the word
"benefited" does not warrant departing from the
unambiguous language of the statute.
Putting it another way, the Court of Claims
hell that, having tentatively benefited by this gift,
this claimed exemption, is tantamount or the same as
having garnered that forever.
fls a matter of fact, the real distinction to
be drawn in this case is between the taxpayer who
suffered the unfortunate consequence of having died
within the three-year period preceding — succeeding the
date of the gift and the one who had not.

In the case

of Mr. Hirschi, having no control over only that event,
which incidentally was the only event that transpired

the reference to benefited

legislation that purports to go back four years before

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

MR. LAUBERs

One very brief point.

One way cf

9

looking at the tax benefit that Mr. Hirschi got, aside

10

from deferring the tax to his heirs and the time value

11

of money, is that he took a gamble.

12

he claimed this benefit and he lived three years he'd

13

never be taxed, either under the gift tax or the estate

14

tax.

15
16

He gambled

that if

He took a betting man’s risk.
QUESTION*

He would still have to — he would

get his unified tax cut by $6,000.

17

MR. LAUBERs

Right, that would happen.

But

18

that property he gave away would never be taxed by the

19

United States under any circumstances.

20

happened here is the decedent took a bit cf a gamble and

lost.

22

So what re.lly

But at this Court held in United States and

23

executor should not complain because his decedent
