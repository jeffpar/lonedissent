During those period of years, sometimes

Ultimately the congressmen from that area,

Congressman Temple, introduced an act which became

ultimately the Termination Act fcr the Catawbas, but

9

only after reviewing it with the tribe, having the tribe

10

approve the concept of terminating the federal

11

relationship with their group, and ultimately after the

12

Act was passed by the Congress, an explanation was sent

13

to te Catawbas, and that explanation made it very clear

14

that the relationship between the federal government and

15

the Catawbas was at an end.

Perhaps it might be worth our while to look at
the joint appendix on page 137.

tribal constitution, and that in fact did happen in

what I want tc ask you is, do you think the statute

QUESTION;

Mr. St. Clair, Judge Butzner in his

4

opinion for the majority of the Court of Appeals

5

referred to something that happened, I guess before the

6

enactment of the Act itself, where he says an Indian

7

expressed concern about the tribes’

8

claim against South Carolina but a Bureau BIA cfficer

9

assured him that any claim the Catawbas had against the

treaty reservation

10

state would not be jeopardized by carrying cut a program

11

with the federal government.

12

MS. ST. CLAIR;

Early in the 1^00’s,

13

representatives cf the Catawbas called upon

14

That was confirmed by an Indian agent to the

Catawbas within this same period, early in the 1900’s.

24

For 75 years thereafter nothing further was lone by the

25

Catawbas with respect to their inquiry as to whether or

You have to understand that prior to 1975, hr.

3

decided, no one understood that non-recognized tribes

That only came --that

Indians, and the Catawbas were locked upon as state

The

1

Catavbas have continuously since 1840, when South

2

Carolina purchased their interests pursuant to the

3

Treaty of Nations, contended that South Carolina had

4

breached their agreement and that they had a claim

5

against South Carolina.

6

What seems to us to be very clear is that the

7

Court of Appeals below has interpreted a claim against

8

South Carolina as being a non-intercourse claim.

9

course, it is not so described.

10

Of

It has been suggested by the respondents that,
well, the claim against South Carolina is sort of a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

shorthand way of contending that there is a claim under

2

the Non-Intercourse Set, and they cite an exhibit in the

3

record. Exhibit 14.
A careful reading of that does not support the

4
5

suggestion, and furthermore it is not likely that the

6

Catawabs had in mind a non-intercourse claim even as

7

late as 1943 because neither the Indians nor the

8

Congress nor the Department of Interior understood that

9

a non-recognized tribe had any federal relationship that

10

would justify a claim under the federal Non-Intercourse

11

Act as appropriate.
That did not come until later, and I guess

12
13

what this case is all

about is, try to transport the law

as it developed in 1975 in Fassamaquoddy back

Catawbas.

It was a contract.

It was not legislatively

2

initiated, and it provided for certain welfare cr

3

certain payments to be made to assist the Catawbas.
Fart of that involved, however, the purchase

4
5

of $75,000 worth of land, some 3,U00 acres by the State

6

of South Carolina, which was then given to the Secretary

7

of Interior to hold in trust for the Catawbas.
The respondents, of course, argue, well,

this

whole case is nothing more than an effort tc terminate

10

that memorandum of understanding which was not

legislatively enacted and did nor reguire legislation to

a fiduciary or trust relationship between the federal

government and the Secretary of the Interior, and the

Catawbas because the Secretary held 3,400 acres in trust

But it did have the appearance, at least, of

that what Congress had in mind in this case was to be

7

that with all due respect the Court of Appeals has

8

violated probably some fairly well understood rules of

9

grammar in their interpretation of the language which is

10

set forth on page 2 of our brief, the new brief, and I

11

think it*s important that we examine in some detail, the

first sentence says the constitution of the tribe,

13

adopted pursuant to the Act of June 18, 1934, as

14

amended, shall be revoked by the Secretary.

15

The reference to 1934 is the circumsaances of

It would seem to us clear that simple grammar

would require "them" to refer to the subject matter of

Well, because "Indians" and

this, and have been for many years in respect to other

Eut,

20

to take the second clause out and say,

MR. ST. CLAIR:

4

You couli read to

Well, all I can say is, even

5

the Mon-Intercourse Act uses Indians and tribes as being

6

co-terminous, meaning the same thing.

7

from that, the second clause does not — and the second

8

one is what the Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit,

9

focused upon, aces not do what that Court said it did.

But quite aside

There is no ambiguity that you can resolve in

10
11

favor of the Indians,

and the ambiguity renders it

12

meaningless, and it was so broad, or viewed by Congress

13

as being so broad that they wanted to be sure that

14

citizenship was saved and that's why that last sentence

15

was in there.
I would like to examine this case in the light

16
17

of Oneida 2, the statute of limitations.

This case is before the Court on the

defendant's motion for summary judgment which was based

18

solely on the effects of the 1959 Act of Congress,

19

that motion necessarily assumed that as of 1359 the.

20

tribe's 1763 treaty plans were still under the full

protection of federal law, and that the tribe's

recognized Indian title had never been validly distrubed

prior to 1959.

24

and

The principal issue decided by the court

1

Congress in 1959 intended to abrogate the special

2

federal protections that applied to the tribe’s 1763

3

treaty claim to 140,303 acres of lard, in addition to

4

lifting federal restrictions and transferring title to a

5

particular 3,400 acres of land that were actually

6

distributed pursuant to the Termination Act.

7

The legislative history of the 1959 Act

8

provides a conclusive answer to that question.

9

that Congress did not intend to remove federal

11

It shows

protections from the 1753 treaty lands.
What Congress intended to do, the legislative

12

history shows,

is enact legislation that was fully

13

consistent with the expressed consent of the Catawba

14

tribe, and tribal consent, the legislative history

15

further shows, was contained in a tribal resolution that

16

expressly conditioned the tribe’s agreement upon leaving

17

the status of its 1763 treaty claim unaffected.

18

At the congressional hearings on the 1959 Act,

19

Congressman Robert W. Hemphill, the bill’s sponsor, left

20

absolutely no doubt that his was legislation designed

21

solely to implement the expressed desires of the tribe

22

as set forth in the tribal resolution of January 3rd,

23

1959, and I quote Congressman Hemphill's testimony

24

before the Interior Committee i

Now,

11

the Congressman's and the Committee's

12

concern for tribal understanding and consent is

13

attributable at least in part to the fact that in 1959

14

we were approaching the end of the termination era, and

15

a year earlier the old federal termiation policy of

16

coercive termination of Indian tribes had been

17

rejected.

18

Termination Acts of Congress, provided for explicit

19

tribal agreement and the earlier Termination Acts did

20

not.

Indeed, the last three Acts of Congress,

Now,

the new federal termination policy held

22

that no tribe would be terminated, in the words cf

beginning of the events which led up to this memorandum

of understanding, the state was seeking a final

22

settlement of a claim against the State of South

24

they asked for assistance from a University of

Indian Affairs cn their behalf and characterized the

2

State’s proposed payment to the tribe as, and

3

"a pittance for 144,300 acres."

4

I quote,

So, clearly in 1937 the state was attempting

5

to buy this 144,000 acre claim for the payment of money,

6

and the state continued these efforts into the 1940's,

7

into the negotiations that led up to the memorandum of

8

understanding,

9

that in return for their participation in this relief

and they were insisting in the early '40s

10

project that they would — that this tribe would have to

11

execute a release and quit claim against all claims

12

against the Sta^e of South Carolina.
But again, the Interior Department and the

13
14

tribe refused to agree to such an agreement, an

15

extinguishment, as they had done in 1937.

16

relented and that three-party agreement was signed by

17

the parties in 1943 without the extinguishment of the

18

claims provision that had been in earlier drafts of the

agreement.

So, in 195? when the tribe souqht to insure

that its claim would not be — or its claim against the

Your Honors,

this legislative history leaves

8

no doubt that the 1959 Act was enacted to carry out an

9

understanding

with the Catawba tribe.

The tribe would

10

agree to a division of the federally held lands and the

11

cessation of minimum federal services on the condition

12

that the Act would not affect the status o^ its 1763

13

treat* claim.

14

If Congress had interded to nullify the

15

express condition upon which tiibal consent had been

16

based, why did it not notify the tribe?

17

intended to begin the running of a state statute of

18

limitations, where was the notice that unless the tribe

19

filed its claim within a period of years, its claim

20

would be extinguished forever?

18

MR. CILLER;

Your Honor, when Congress has

19

intended to aiply a statute of limitations alone, it has

20

expressly said so, as it did in 29 U.S.C. Section 2415.

21

QUESTION;

But the purpose of Congress

22

applying the statute of limitations -- it’s a question

23

of Congress withdrawing a status which prevented the

24

state statute from running.

25

MR. KILLER;

Well, I understand that that’s

4

from that 3,400 acres that was actually distributed?

5

QUESTION;

hut the question is, from what
Was it removed from

Well, I thought you were .just

6

making the argument that when Congress gees about

7

applying a statute of limitations and -- it spells it

8

out very specificsily,

10

but that's when the statute of

imposed by Congress.

Here, all Congress is saying, jf your

11

opponents are correct, is that this status, particular

12

status is withdrawn and one of the consequences of the

13

withdrawal of that status is that the state statute new

14

begins to run.

15

HR. HILLER;

Well, taking that for a moment,

16

then, the 1959 Act states that -- does not say, state

17

statutes of limitation will apply.

18

about is the applicat ion of gena ral state law, in

19

Section 5, and

20

what we apply is a se parate series of state statutes

21

wholly apart from state statutes of limitations.

22

25

What it dees talk

if we apply the gene ral state law here

QUESTION;

Are you suggesting that state

statutes of limitations are not general state law?
MR. MILLER;

Oh, no, Ycur Honor.

The general

application of state law would include the statute of

limitations, buSt it would also include the application

2

cf a separate series of state statutes which we lodged

3

with the Court on December 10th, statutes which remain

4

in full force today, which establish a state law scheme

5

that expressly defeases the Catawbas of their title to

6

the land, and grants fee simple title to the lessees who

7

occupied the land back in the early 1800 's.
So, these statutes,

8

9

state statutes, wholly

apart from the operation of state statutes cf

10

limitations, would mean that as a matter cf state law

11

the Catawbas had beer, defeased of their title since 1840

12

when the statute was enacted.
So, if we read Section 5 to apply to not only
