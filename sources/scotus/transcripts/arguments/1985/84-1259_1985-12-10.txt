In September of 1977, EPA conducted a

3

three-hour on-site inspection of the cwo powerhouses at

request Dow submitte, drawings and schematics to EPA

depicting the powerhouses, the equipment in the

17

powerhouses, and the areas surrounding the powerhouses.

18

The EPA enforcement engineer testified that after that

19

September inspectio.* he needed no further information

20

from or about Dow to confirm his suspicions that the

21

powerhouses were in violation of the Act.

22

Three months later,

in early December of 1977,

23

Dow received a phone call from the EPA requesting a

24

repetitive on-site inspection with a camera.

25

refused that request, told the EPA it would not allow

2

possibility of EPA’s getting a warrant was discussed.
In fact, after the phone call a Dow attorney

o

4

called the D.S. attorney's office in Bay City, Michigan

5

and told that office that if the EPA approached the

6

office and was going to try to seek a warrant, that Dew

7

would appreciate the opportunity to be there and be

8

heard.

9

Two months after that refusal cf the second

10

on-site inspection, knowing that Dow refused consent for

11

a second on-site inspection, knowing that Dew objected

12

to aerial photographs, or the photographs of its plant,

13

and knowing of its duty to resort to the court, the EPA

14

ignored Dow’s constitutional and statutory rights and

15

ignored its duty to seek judicial oversight and acquired

16

surreptitiously --

17

QUESTION*

But isn’t the question in the case,

1C

whether it had such a duty?

You said it ignored this

19

duty, but isn’t that the issue?

20

MS. GCOTEE*

Yes, Justice Stevens.

The issue

21

is whether there was a search.

Okay, so you have no objection to

the flying over and taking a look, but to the

sole objection is to the taking of the photographs?
MS. GOOTEEs

7

— your

Yes, it is, and that -- that’s

8

both constitutional and statutory.

9

the taking of pictures,

Under the statute

the capturing of the extreme

10

intrusive detail to the size of a half-inch in diameter,

11

deprives Dow of the notice that an inspection has

12

occurred and deprives Dow of the opportunity to claim

13

confidential business information.
QUESTIONS

14
15

Well, would you object to standing

on the hillside with a camera?
MS. GCOTEEs

Justice Brennan, that’s an

17

interesting hypothetical.

Midland, Michigan is very

Generally a lateral view from the

that people can drive by and look at our plant.

Now —

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

11

MS. GCOTEE:

As we go into the sky at varying

levels, it’s going to depend more and more cn the degree

of intrusion.

If one is equipped with a camera and there is

that be objectionable?
MS. GOOTEEi

20

I have to come back to degree of

intrusion.

We’re on level ground, not even with a

hilltop, and the police or the inspection officials take

Yes, it is.

It's very bad.

Except that I think the

Before you go on, may I put another

hypothetical that I suspect you will say is difficult.

One reads in the media that a satellite flying 100

2

miles, not 20,000 feet but 100 miles above the Earth can

3

identify a tennis ball on a tennis court.

4

These satellites are up there every day,

the

5

Soviet and the Amerina, and if these pictures had been

6

taken by an unfriendly — at 100 miles up, would that

7

make any difference?
MS. G00TEE;

excellent hypothetical and one we've obviously thought

about.

stay away from is the spatial relationship.

The distinction that I think this Court should

I don't think it matters whether it's 1,000
feet up or 100 miles up.

14

QUESTION*

It's really a matter of privilege?

15

NS. GCOTEE:

It's purpose, and in this case --

16

it's mostly military satellites that have that

17

capability.

ten meters.

coming in, it may be four meters.

21

That's usually top secret information.

You may proceed.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

5

please the Court, we have been discussing various types

6

of aerial overflights.

7

clear is that there is — one of the distinguishing

8

factors in this case is the intrusive aerial photographs

9

taken by EPA.

10

The one thing we did not make

This was no brief, non-intrusive

11

investigation.

12

brief, the Agency if they had access to these

13

photographs captured the entire details of Dow's

in fact the equivalent of good engineering drawings.

Now, the Sixth Circuit agreed with the

18

district court that Dow has a reasonable expectation of

19

privacy from ground level intrusion, and then in an

20

apparent flip-flop, in an inconsistency in its opinion,

21

the court held

22

that it has no reasonable expectation of privacy.

23

that from the air Dow is an open field,

I direct the Court's attention to photograph 3

May I ask you a couple of

questions.

Supposing the problem were either emissions

from a stack or water or some chemical being discharged

it except by flying over the plant, but if you do fly

11

over the plant you could see a discoloration of water or

maybe some smoke coming out of a

Would it be illegal and unconstitutional under

Thank, you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Courts
Referring to the issue that came up several

5
6

times in petitioner's argument as to whether EPA

7

conducted a search here, obviously the ultimate issue in

8

this case is whether there was a search within the

9

meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

But, she has suggested

10

that we conceded in the court of appeals that there was

11

a search here, and of course that's true, there was a

12

search in the layman's normal use of the term, that is,

13

EPA was looking for something.
That is what law enforcement agencies do all

I understand its position is that it has trade

and we devoted quite a bit of attention to that in our

the intrusive surveillance of detail beyond the purview

I think also, more generally, the reason why

to do with he Fourth Amendment.

12

13

that principle is limited by what the

20

22

because it is a clear, -recognized principle of trade

5

6

that is not a violation of trade

So, again, I am not sure there is really a

7

secret here.

But the reasons for having these kinds cf

8

unfair competition statutes don’t have to do with the

9

Fourth Amendment.

It’s easy to see that conduct that

10

might be considered unfair competition under the trade

11

secret laws would clearly not be considered a Fourth

12

Amendment violation.

13

One example is the use of an informant, which

14

government law enforcement agencies do all the time, and

15

that’s not considered to violate the Constitution.

16

the other hand, most trade secret statutes suggest that

17

convince an employee of another plant to exchance

19

5

considered it unfair competition.

6

Even in that context, I can’t believe if the

7

state had sent a plane over to check for building code

8

violations, if that was threatening the safety of the

9

employees who were going to be working in that plant,

10

that that would be considered to violate the Fourth

12

14

They’re just not taking trade secrets.
They’re looking for other information.
Finally, I would make one more point about the

15

trade secret claim, and that is that it doesn’t really

16

address what the issue here is because what they’re

17

claiming, I take it, is that the EPA overflight and

18

photography was some kind of a ..earch that required EPA

to get a war .ant.

this overflight.

The relief that they are seeking here, forcing EPA to

The companion case to this one will be coming

privilege of the home, where the overflight and the

Here we had a footnote in our brief,

8
9

discussing whether this qualifies as privilege or not.

10

I think there’s an argument that it’s not privilege at

11

all here, but we’ve been willing to assume for purposes

12

of this case that it can be treated the same because we

13

feel there is no expectation of privacy in any of them.
Basically, what Dow’s position is, is that

11

doesn't let EPA take photographs that are relevant to

12

its enforcement of the Clean Air Act.
And,

13

there's no reason why the Fourth

14

Amendment should do that.

They can't build a roof, they

15

say, and from that they draw the conclusion that the

16

Fourth Amendment should provide a roof for them.

17

From that, we draw the conclusion that what

they have in there is just not private aid they can't

whether there is an expectation cf privacy in the sense

that you can expect that what you have in there can't be

seen from the outside, and then there's a second aspect,

which is whether what you're seeking to protect is

You may well know that someone

can fly over and take photographs through the glass, if

that’s possible, I don’t know, and that will reveal

On the other hand, what you do have in an

7

something that we have recognized as being more private,

and it may be that the rule should be more stringent

The point is whether there is a legitimate

If the

person on the ground probably has a right to assume that

he's going to be free from that kind of surveillance,

reasonable expectation of privacy.
If EPA is doing nothing more than taking the

to that is that as long as you're going to-have a

development of

people have — it does give an additional protection
