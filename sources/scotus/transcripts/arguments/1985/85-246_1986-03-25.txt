ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR, ESQ.,

PRO HAC VICE, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. MINEAR;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, the question in this case is whether

10

an Indian may assert tribal hunting rights as a defense

11

to prosecution for taking wildlife in violation of

12

federal conservation statutes.

13

The focus in this case is on protection of cur

14

national symbol, the bald eagle, a majestic but

15

endangered species.

16

protection under

17

Species Act, the eagle remains the frequent object of

18

black market trade.

19

Despite extensive federal

the Bald Eagle Act and the Endangered

23

Respondent, a

At trial, the United States produced extensive

24

evidence that respondent had engaged in a series of

25

eagle transactions over a two-year period in which he

1

had offered to kill, killed, and sold eagles fcr profit

2

to undercover agents posing as Indian crafts dealers.

3

The jury found respondent guilty of killing

4

tald eagles, in violation of the Endangered Species Set,

5

and of selling eagles and other protected tirds in

6

violation of the Bald Eagle Set and the Migratory Bird

7

Treaty Act.

The United States Court of Appeal for the
Eighth Circuit sitting en banc partially vacated

10

respondent's conviction.

11

Tankton Sioux Indians have ar iirplied treaty right to

12

hunt eagles for noncommercii1 purposes.

13

further concluded that neither the Bald Eagle Act nor

14

the Endangered Species Act demonstrated sufficient

15

Congressional intent to limit that right.

16

The court concluded that

The court

The court stated that the United States cccld

17

retry respondent, but the government would be required

18

tc prove that respondent had taken the eagles fcr

The United States’ position in this case is

en banc judgment that occurred before the remand?
MR. MINEAR*

Yes, that is right.

The issue

10

that this Court is reviewing is whether or not this

11

affirmative defense in fact exists.

12

there is in fact no commercial or noncommercial taking

13

defense for Indians in these cases.

Is that right?
Yes.

Se think that the Court of

20

Appeals has foreclosed takings and made them illegal in

21

the other situations.

22

Continuing,

we submit that Congress dees net

24

prohibition on the taking cf wildlife applicable tc

In this instance. Congress has given special

protection to the nation's severely threatened eagle

differently, although both are --

Considerably different.

Well, I thought the government

that when they were young they resembled bald eagles,

As this time the golden eagle is net listed as

an endangered species.

It has not been listed under the

Endangered Species Act as an endangered species.

5

nevertheless submit that there is a substantial threat

6

tc the golden eagle population.

»e

He submit that there is no real conflict

7

8

between Indian hunting rights and the federal statute.

9

This conclusion is not only sensible, it is consistent

10

with the Yankton Sioux treaty, the statutory language,

11

and the nation's vital interest in protecting endangered

12

species.

13

We turn first to the Indian treaty itself.

14

The 1858 treaty with the Yankton Sioux makes no mention

15

whatsoever of specific Indian hunting rights, much less

16

the right to hunt eagles.

17

exhaustable, and neither contemplated hew eagles might

Certainly under these circumstances the

government dees net surrender through silence its

sovereign power and responsibility to protect eagles for

5

future generations.

6

that right as an exercise of its tribal trust authority

7

and for the public at large.

Instead, the government retained

Likewise, the Yanktcn Sicux, who considered

8
9

the capture of an eagle a sacred activity, had no reason

10

tc expect that the treaty gave them an absolute right tc

11

kill eagles.

12

would destroy the very treaty right they now claim.

Indeed, unlimited Indian hunting of eagles

13

In short, whatever hunting rights the Yanktcn

14

Sioux might possess, they do not have an absolute right

15

to conduct hunting activities that threaten the survival

16

of a species that is of great importance tc the entire

17

nation.
An examination of the Eald Eagle Act and the

18
19

Endangered Species Act leads to the same result.

20

Congress plainly intended that these statutes, framed in

21

terms of universal application,

principle has been firmly established since the 1930‘s,

Instead, they impose

Given the migratory nature of eagles, the

species can only be preserved and restored to its

original numbers if all are subject to the conservation

In turn, all will ultimately benefit from the

fruits cf this conservation program.

Thus there is no direct conflict between

17

They can be reconciled in much the same

In all events, the Bald Eagle Act and the

18

Endangered Species Act amply meet the higher standard

that respondent suggests.

20

show that Congress considered the special cultural and

21

religious interests of Indians and balanced their needs

22

against the conservation purposes of these statutes.

23

For example,

Both statutes on their face

the Bald Eagle Act provides a

24

limited exception, authorizing the Secretary to permit

25

Indians to use eagles for religious purposes.
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The

1

Endangered Species Act also contains a limited

2

exception, authorizing Alaskan natives to take

3

endangered species for subsistence purposes.

4

These carefully limited exceptions applicable

5

to particular Indian activity demonstrate that Congress

6

intended these statutes to apply to the Indian tribes.

7

Moreover, application tc the Indians is necessary if the

8

broad conservation goals of these statutes are to be

9

met.

The nation’s 240 Indian reservations have a

The threat to the tald eagle is quite real.

2

Recent statistics indicate that there are only 12,000

3

remaining bald eagles ir the lower 48 states.

4

QUESTION!

You feel the public interest is

5

something different than the statutes and treaties

6

involved here?

That is another element of the case?

HR. MINEAR*

7

I think it is something that

8

again should be given consideration.

The statute should

9

be construed in order tc effectuate its purposes.

And I

10

think that Congress did intend to protect the bald eagle

11

through the Bald Eagle Act.

Yes, but I thought you were just

having concluded your discussion of the statutory and

17

Yes, essentially it is. Your

Honor.

Shat I am trying to indicate is that the actual

statistics that indicate the threat to the bald eagle in

We start from the premise that

9

there is a treaty right, and is the right one to kill

10

the eagles, because I notice in the House legislative

11

history there was a suggestion that historically the

12

tribe did not actually kill the eagles, but rather

13

trapped them and was able to get their feathers without

14

actually destroying the eagle.

MR. PECHOTA;

10

Nell, that would be the primary

That is the primary one?
Right, within the context of

this case.
In applying the principles for abrogation of

12

treaties tc the Acts in this case, the Bald Eagle

13

Protection Act and Endangered Species Act, we start with

14

the Bald Eagle Protection Act that was passed in 1940.

15

Nobody maintains, including the government, that there

16

was any language in that 1940 enactment that abrogated

17

any particular treaty right.

18

From 1940 until 19 62 that particular Act was

19

not applied against Indians while they were cn their

20

reservation.

21

amendments were to increase the penalties and to include

22

the golden eagle as a part of the particular statute.

23

In 1962, there were some amendments.

The

Contemporaneous almost with the enactment of

the solicitor cf the Department cf interior indicated

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1

Circuit Court of Appeals determined, certainly there

2

were other explanations other than that this was tc

apply to the Indian reservations that could explain that

4

permit prevision in that amendment.

5

The Eighth Circuit said

that there were

6

Indians and non-Indians outside of the reservations,

7

that did not live on the reservations, that certainly

8

could and probably would have been involved in Indian

9.

religious rites where these particular eagle feathers

10

and parts of eagles could have been used and would have

11

been necessary.

12

So,

this permit prevision does net apply by

13

its terms to Indian reservations.

14

everywhere, whether or not they are on Indian

15

reservations.

16

and it would seem according to the respondent that that

17

is not sufficient and net sufficient language to result

18

in an abrogation of his right in this particular case.

19

It applies to Indians

Certainly that is a logical explanation,

Now, from 1962 tc 1973, the date of the

20

passage of the Endangered Species Act, I was not able to

21

find any reported cases where the Eald Eagle Irotection

Act was applied to Indians in criminal matters while

23

they were on the reservation.

In 1973,

the Endangered

Species Act was passed, and there were two previsions iE

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

indicates that it ms the intent of Congress to abrogate

2

the right of Indians to take eagles for traditional

3

cultural purposes.
One cf them was the exemption that was set in

4
5

the Act for Alaskan natives.

However, the Court must

6

keep in mind that two years prior to 1973 Congress had

7

passed the Alaskan Settlement Act, where the rights cf

8

natives to hunt and fish had been terminated , had been

9

abrogated in specific language,

so it was necessary to

10

put in the Endangered Species Act some protection fcr

11

the Alaskan natives and the Alaskan Indians.
Indian tribes in the lewer 48 states did net

12
13

need that particular protection because they had the

14

protection of their reserved rights.

15

in mind that the Alaskan Indians and Alaskan natives

16

were treated much differently than Indian tribes in the

17

lewer 48 states.

18

on this Court held that they had no self-governing

19

rights, and there were very few reservations that were

20

in Alaska.

In addition, keep

They weren’t treaty tribes.

Earlier

And so, a logical explanation for that and the

21

22

only explanation is that they thought that they needed

23

the protection that the lower 48 state Indian tribes did

24

not need.

25

The other provision that the government points
34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

to to show that there is an exemption or that there is

2

an abrogation in this case was a bill that was enacted

3

in the 92nd Congress, the Congress immediately preceding

4

the one that passed the Endangered Species Act, which

5

was the 93rd Congress, and in that Congress,

6

Congress, there were two bills, one that dealt with a

7

specific exemption, in other words, included a specific

8

exemption for Indians from the Act, one which did net.

Both of those particular bills died with the

the 92nd

10

S2nd Congress after the 92nd Congress adjourned.

They

11

were not introduced again.

12

13

that because these bills had been introduced in a

14

previous Congress and died, that that is seme indication

15
