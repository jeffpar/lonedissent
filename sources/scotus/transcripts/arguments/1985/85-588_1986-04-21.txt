MR. BROGANi

10

Bhat about the remedy?
The remedies are entirely

11

different.

12

damages are limitel, wher ea s -andar 1983 you're not

13

limited as to back pay, compensatory,

14

and so forth.

15

Under Title VII the back pay is limited,

the

punitive damages,

The period of time of the statute cf

16

limitations is different as to both statutory schemes.

17

So we think that tnara is a

18

difference.

But we think that under our theory of the case

19

that there's really no different reasons why you should

20

apply one rule as to one scheme and one as to another.

21

He think that under the holdings cf this Court that

22

there is no express or implied repeal of the full faith

23

and credit doctrine clearly to 1983, and neither do we

24

think there is as to Title VII.

25

Now, this action arose when the University

1

simply proposed to terminate plaintiff's employment fer

2

inadequate work performance and improper job behavior.

3

And under the Tennessee Administrative Procedure Act,

4

which is the

5

jurisdictions, the University was required to afford the

6

Respondent an opportunity for a hearing, and he elected

7

to take a hearing under the Dniform Administrative

Procedure Act.

you would have in the federal court.

discrimination.

Is that what happened?

19

SB. BROSANi

No, Your Honor, that is not what

20

happened.

It is true that certain evidence was net

admitted, but the evidence is abundantly clear, and both

Well, Mr. Brogan, are you claiming

6

that the state administrative decision is a judicial

7

proceeding of a court within the meaning of Section

1738?
MB. BROGAN*

Yes,

we are, Ycur Merer.

It is

10

plainly a judicial proceeding, because under the

11

nation’s statutory scheme a

12

legislation to permit the executive branch as well as

state can enable and- enact'

13

the administrative branch of state government to

14

exercise judicial powers.

15

Now, the state of Tennessee and 31 other

16

jurisdictions have done this in the ferm cf adopting

17

this Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.

18

that Act, there isn’t any question but what this is a

No, sir.
Or is it on the record?
It's on the record, but -- but —

just a question of substantial eviience or some

T1

violation of the law, is that it?

12

It’s

jCj

MB. BROGANs

That’s correct.

According to the

13

law, the state law says that the only method of judicial

14

review of this federal decision is to file a petition in

15

a state chancery court within 60 days from the late of

16

the final order.

17

And the state statute sets forth the scope of

18

judicial review, which is very similar to the federal

19

Administrative Procedure Act.

20

it’s contrary to law, if it’s contrary to the facts, or

21

if it’s net supported by substantial evidence.

22

It can te set aside if

Now, that’s what he contended when he went

back to the district court.

Sew, after the decision is made, the judge

found that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant

12

He said, considering everything in its proper context,

What he did was he filed a motion which in

3

Procedure Act the judgment of the agency.

5

what he sail.

And that's
This is

He says, the decision of the judge and the

6
7

agency constituted an abuse of discretion, is contrary

8

to law, and is not supported by reliable, probative, and

9

substantial evidence.
Then over in paragraph number 8, he said;

10

The

11

administrative law judge's and agency's decision and

12

remedy — the remeiy, that's ordering his transfer —

13

was equally unconstitutional and unlawful in wrongfully

14

rejecting said claims of racial discrimination despite

15

clear evidence thereof.
New, if it please the Ccurt, he made nc

16
17

argument before the district court that the evidence —

18

that he didn't have a full and fair opportunity to

19

litigate.

20

decision is wrong.

21

He said the evidence in overwhelming that the

New, the district court said^

QUESTION;

Well, Hr. Brogan, Section 1738, as

ycu knew, uses the term "such acts, records, and

23

judicial proceedings."

And don't you think it stretches

24

the language a bit to say that a proceeding presided

25

over by an administrative law judge is a judicial

(202) 628-9300

1

proceeding in the sansa that the people who drafted 1738

2

used it?
ME. BROGAN,:

3

Sell , we think it is, Ycur Honor,

4

for this reason.

This Court in Thomas versus Washington

5

Gas £ Light Company, every member of this court in

6

Thomas, fait that issue preclusion should apply to an

7

agency adjudication, and the plurality said that state

8

agency aijuiicitions were just as entitled to full faith

9

and credit as a state court judgment.
And every member of

10

this Ccurt agreed.

The

k

11

only disagreement was with whether claim preclusion

12

should apply in that case.

Eut net cne memler cf this

13

Court dissented

with the proposition that issue

14

preclusion should apply to an agency adjudication.
New, in seme cf the recent cases that have

15
16

been decided under these statutes, the Migra case, the

17

Farscns case, which is the most recent case, this Ccurt

18

It says*.

20

"The Full Faith ini Cradit Act, 28 U.S. Code

21

Section 1738, requires federal courts as well as state

22

courts to give state judicial proceedings the same full

23

24

And the same thing with the harese case.

But that's no revelation, because

KB. BEQGANw

Sell, I think ycu'd have tc leek

5

at the state law, Your Honor, to determine what is a

8

specifically enacted by the state legislature for the

purpose of enabling people to protect their

And if a judicial proceeding under

10

constitutional and statutory rights, where they have the

11

same plenary type right tc a hearing as ycu wculd have

12

in a federal court — I don't know what a judicial

13

proceeding is.

14

It's similar, it's very similar tc .the federal

15

Administrative Procedure Act, and this Court has always

16

ruled, since at least Utah,

18

they're unappealed, are entitled to full faith and

But is that because the Court held

that they were judicial proceedings within the meaning

22

of 1738 or just thit as a natter of common law

24
25

Well, it would have to be on the

(202) 628-9300

because the full faith and credit statute, cf course,

does not apply to tha falseal government.

3

principle is the same, and we can’t find any difference

But the

4

between applying one standard to state agency

5

adjudications and another one to federal adjudications.
And we think that in this case the reason is

6
7

avail aora pronounce! than in a federal adjudication

8

because if the full faith and credit doctrine applies

9

then it's mandatory that the principle be applied,

10

whereas under the federal agency adjudications it’s not

11

mandated and

12

I suppose, as to wiathar to apply traditional rules of

13

preclusion.

this Court has some leeway and discretion,

14

So our position is that if you look at the

15

meaning of the full faith and credit clausa and it’s

16

17

does is just implement the clausa, an!

18

Now, of coursa. If it’s not a judicial

In so doing, they

fail to make the critical distinctions that are

necessary in detar*Lning how tha Court should handle the

12

Tha particular decision is not covered by the

Similarly, Section 1738 of U.S.C. 28 does not apply

Since «e are not faced with the tension that

that what we are left with is the common law

Congress enunciated certain principles concerning the

rights of employees to bring cases in federal court.

all employees, whether federal, state, or private, would

be entitled to that trial de novo, regardless of what
