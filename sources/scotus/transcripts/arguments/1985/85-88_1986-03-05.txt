precedent suggests that the new law does not apply
retroactively to a back child support award so that the
illegitimate child in this case would lose all right to

MS HGRNIKs

Because this new — the new

period, contains no language in it to suggest that it

4

would apply retroactively.

5

statutory construction that in the absence of —

QUESTION*

Pennsylvania has a rule of

Well, my only suggestion is,

7

wouldn’t the Pennsylvania courts be better able to —

8

more qualified to address this application than we are?

9

MS HORNIKi

No, because it’s already been

10

decided under Pennsylvania precedent that the law in

11

existence at the time of the filing of a paternity

12

complaint is the law to be applied in the case, and

13

since this case was filed in February of

14

to be applied would be the six-year statute of

15

limitations that was in existence in 1980.

And has the — the courts of

17

Pennsylvania, in any case other than yours here, dealt

18

with this statute?

With the six-year statute, or with

the 18-year?

The 18-year.

MS HORNIKs

No, because it's so new, it just

QUESTION

1

Well, as Justice Brennan has

2

suggested, can you suggest a reason why the Pennsylvania

3

courts shouldn’t deal with this first before we

4

undertake to do something, just as a matter of policy

5

and practice if nothing else?
MS HORNIKi

6

I beLieve that it’s more important

7

for this Court to make a determination regarding the

8

constitutionality pf the six-year statuta of limitations

9

that was in existence at the time of the filing of the

10

complaint rather than sending the case back

to the

11

Pennsylvania court for a determination that has already

12

been made under Pennsylvania precedent.
In other words, in the Hatfield versus Hazel

13
14

Baker case, in the Jenncr versus Stillman case, and most

15

particularly the Williams versus Wolfe case, the

16

Pennsylvania courts have spoken and said the appropriate

17

— that the date of the filing of the complaint is the

18

date —

19

QUESTION*

May I ask you this.

Supposing you

2

filed this complaint on the 1st of December of last year

21

instead of now, and then on January 15th of something

22

they came in with the statute of limitations defense.

23

Would you not then have argued that the new

24

statute applies?

You wouldn’t have just thrown in the

25

towel on the issue,

would you?

6

Are you willing to

I hope you won’t, but —
MS HORNISCs

Well, I — there's one peculiarity

7

of Pennsylvania law which must be made clear, and that

8

is that the oriar of chili support in every support case

9

is retroactive to the date of the filing of the

10

complaint, and so that in Pennsylvania —
QUESTION*

I understand.

You're making the

12

argument against the statute applying.

MS HORNIK*

That's correct. Justice Stevens,

20

but since there's this particular rule of civil

21

procedure which states that an order of support is

22

retroactive to the date of the filing of the complaint,

23

and I know of no Pennsylvania case in which child

support was awarded for a period prior to the date of

25

the filing of a chili

MS HORNIK*

9

No, for example —
Well, tell me where we didn't.
In the Mills case that was before

you the same thing happened .

During the pendency of the

10

Mills case the Texas statute was changed from one year

11

to four years, and you decided the constitutionality of

12

the one-year statute of limitations in paternity cases

13

in the Mills case, because you made the determination

1\

that the child in that case would not have gotten the

15

benefit of the four-year statute and would have been

16

barred from continuing cn in a paternity case.

It's a little different.

to let the State pass on it, on its statute.

consideration of the cost benefit of a statute which

QUESTION;

Counsel, I take it you would make

th same argument whatever the statutory period is?
MS HORNIK;

That's correct, and in

15

Pennsylvania a child beyond the age

16

ask the father for child support if she needs money for

17

college expenses, if she’s impoverished or disabled, and

18

so that the right for a legitimate child could continue

on throughout the father's lifetime, and so that even

needs of the child.

3

MS HORNIXs

Justice Rehnquist,

that’s correct,

4

but the illegitimate child never has the same procedure

5

as the legitimate child because the illegitimate child

has a two-part procedure.

proceeding and then a support proceeding.

legitimate child, because of the presumptions that

has to do is say, my parents were married, you know, at

Well,

the thing is that the

procedure itself is a safeguard.

3

for a father’s support, ar,. if a legitimate child has

4

through age 50, to ask for a father's support, then the

5

illegitimate child should have the same time period.

6

However, tie illegitimate chili will always

have the burden of proving paternity.

At the outset, we do not oppose remand in this

There has been no definitive

Pennsylvania is as your opponent has stated it?

Yes, we io agree to that.

In fact,

20

the Pennsylvania courts, at least as we understand the

law, would interpret it the way appellant has.

22

there has been no definitive resolution, and indeed the

MR. ONEKs

That was also denied. Your Honor.

6

I don’t think that appellee has admitted support during

the early years of the child.
The first criterion is whether the statute of

provides a reasonable opportunity for the child to

of course true that scientific testing has reduced the

possibility of false accusations of paternity, but the

22

new scientific tests, including the HLA test which is

23

used in Pennsylvania,

24
25

is not conclusive.

The leading study, the one cited by amici, the
Terasaki study of 1,300 people, shows that in tan
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

percent of these cases the HLA test could make no
resolution at all, and in the other cases where it did
indicate probatively that the defendant was the father,
the degree of probability ranged from 9Q percent to
higher.
There is no court in the United States which
treats HLA tests as conclusive.

To the contrary, all of

them permit a defendant to submit evidence on such
issues as non-access to the mother during the relevant
time period.
What kind of evidence must the defendant rely
on?

Obviously, he must rely on witnesses who are

available, on the memory of those witnesses and his own
memory, and in some cases, of course, he must rely cn
documentary avide: re like appointment calendars, credit
card records and so forth.
There can be no question that the accuracy and
reliability of that evidence diminishes over time.

It

is far more difficult for a defendant to reconstruct his
activities and the activities of the mother six years or
ten years after the event than it would be for him to
reconstruct those activities one year, two years, or
three years after the event.

I understand, but do you think your

NR. ONEKs

In the Pickett case, Nr. Onek, the

Court looked at the incongruity of a longer statute of

peculiarity or incongruity exists in Pennsylvania, does

14

it not?

15

HR. ONEKi

Yes, but I think it's a very

16

different situation because all the arguments I have

17

just made about fairness to the father don't apply with

18

the same force when the father is dead.

19

and social impact on the father obviously doesn't exist

when the father is already deceased.

HR. ONEK;

There’s an allegation

amount of support for the child, the statute isn’t

running because the woman would then have two years

highly unlikely situation.

ME. ONEKs

Pennsylvania changed the law — the

24

short answer, I think, is that it was reguirei to do so

25

in order to receive AFDC money.

As you know, in

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1984

1

Congress enacted a law which said that unless a state

2

moves to an 18-year statute of limitations, it would be

3

deprived of AFDC money.

4

Although I don’t Know the exact amount of AFDC

5

money that Pennsylvania receives, I assume that it’s in

6

the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.

7

Pennsylvania and I assume every other state in the union

8

will now move to an 18-year statute of limitations.

9

Therefore,

That may in fact be a good policy judgment.

10

All I am arguing here is that the State of Pennsylvania

11

prior to that was not required constitutionally to have

12

an 18-year statute, that it could have a six-year

13

statute, and that such a statute is constitutional.

If you have no further questions, I conclude
my argument.

MS HORNIK*

In my opponent’s argument, first

of all it seems to be more like a due process argument

in favor of fathers, rather than the issue that's before
