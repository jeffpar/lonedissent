Hr. Fraser appealed to the district court.

6

The district court, as affirmed by the Ninth Circuit,

7

has ruled that public school districts can only regulate

8

student speech if it is obscene under the Hiller versus

recognized is if the speech caused a physical disruption

QUESTIONS

What was the grade or age range of

the students?
MR. COATS*

7

It's a school that has sophomores

8

through seniors, so the young est would be 14, the oldest

9

would be 18, and they would range in there according to

10

their grades.
Mr. Fraser -- you will note that the district

11
12

did not take cavalierly his claims that he was being

13

discriminated against or that somehow his viewpoint was

14

being suppressed.

15

case, you'll find that Mr. Fraser appealed to the

16

district's hearing officer from the decision of his

17

building principal, and

18

decision, which is part of the joint appendix, that one

19

of the conclusions that was not overturned by the

20

district court was tnat there was no viewpoint

21

discrimination here, that the district's sole concern

22

was to limit vulgarity and indecent language in the

23

school setting.

I think if you read that

4

This Court has also indicated that the

5

regulation of vulgarity and indecent speech is on the

6

periphery of the First Amendment.

7

Court that when you review this case one of the issues

8

is where does the federal court system relate itself to

9

the public schools.

We submit to this

And we would suggest to you, with

10

the rights herein involved and the speech here involved,

11

absent viewpoint suppression, tnat there should be

12

minimal court review and that all a school district

13

should be required to do is to justify its actions with

14

a reasonable educational purpose.

Mr. Coats, may I ask you a

MR. COATS*

something this Court has oft recognized, is that schools

teach societal values.
Indeed, there's a statute in the State of

Washington that expressly mates it a duty of the school

multifold, but certainLy one of them is to teach these

students basic societal values.

The record on that, it was given,

he claims, to three teachers.

15

Approximately ten minutes in advance of the assembly,

16

Mr. Fraser went in, and the teacher was the teacher that

17

had the responsibility for the newspaper.

Two teachers testified.

Other students were present, and that teacher

told Mr. Fraser, she said, Matt -- and this is her

testimony -- "That speech is inappropriate, don't give

it."

22

He then went to another teacher, Mr. DeHart.

23

Mr. DeHart told him, and his testimony will show;

24

"Matt, that speech is inappropriate, don't give it."

25

Mr. DeHart also testified that it was his recollection

the teachers exercised --

I’m asking you, did they or did

13

they not have authority to stop him from making the

MR. COATS*

15

They would have authority, for

16

example, to demand that he go to the office.

17

would submit to you that that’s really not how

18

discipline works and is not a realistic view, that if a

19

teacher in a school setting tells the student, that's

20

inappropriate, don't io it, and then the student doesn’t

21

respond, then it becomes appropriate for disciplinary

action.

Again, if you read the record from the school

1
2

district, one of the findings of the hearing officer who

3

considered this was that a lesser form of corrective

4

action would not have corrected this particular

5

problem.

6

that in its capacity as an educator and dealing with

7

these students it had an obligation to respond to this

8

particular speech.

Indeed, the speech district feels strongly

Mr. Fraser seems to argue that the school

9
10

district’s sole remedy is to talk it over with him, to

11

debate with him the appropriateness of this.

12

to this Court that Mr. Fraser's argument misconstrues

13

the relationship of a student to an educator.

a relationship of one debater to another, that indeed

15

the educator has authority over the student when

We also note that there are important

12

Essentially what the Ninth Circuit has held is

13

that a public school district cannot reach that

conclusion and cannot have such a rule.

15

We submit to you that the board's

Hr. Coats, may I just ask ask on

7

the rule, the rule prohibits disruptive — I mean,

8

material and substantial interference with the

9

educational process, including obscene and profane

10
11

language.
Now, what is -- precisely that is your

12

position, that this was obscene language within the

13

meaning of the rule?

14

HR. COATS*

Yes.

You’ll find that that was

15

considered again by the hearing officer’s decision at

16

the school district, and the school district’s

17

interpretation of its own rule is that obscene should be

18

given its common and ordinary meaning, which includes

19

lewd and vulgar language.

20

QUESTION!

Of course, we’re dealing by

21

hypothesis with speech that’s non-obscene for

22

constitutional purposes.

23

HR. COATS*

The speech does not meet the

24

standard of Miller versus California.

25

It’s not close.

We concede that.

But I would point out to you that the standard

that was set out in Siller versas California on

obscenity according to this Court was designed only to

prescribe hard-core pornography.

compelling interest its reason for suppressing those

ideas.

But here, where the only — where the record

17
18

clearly shows that the only purpose for the school's

19

action was to suppress vulgarity and indecency in the

20

public school setting, then we would suggest to the

21

Court that a school district should only have to meet a

22

standard of showing a rational educational basis, and

clearly there is such a basis.

as to whether this speech was covered by this word.
MR. COATS t

11

I thinr my response to you was

12

that we have no written decisions in construing this,

13

and that to my knowledge this is the first time that the

14

district had construed its own rule where there was a

15

record kept.
Now, school rules are enforced on a daily

16
17

basis in the public school setting, and I can assure you

18

that if a student swears or is yulgar in the school

action.

Mr. Fraser construes that, he says, well,

7

he knew that speech was given and he thought that the

8

only that happened was the principal called him in and

9

talked to him about it, big deal.

I mean, he gives

10

probably the best evidence we have of why the district

11

in this case was compelled to take a more demonstrative

12

action to impress upon the students that this was not

13

appropriate speech in that particular forum, in that

public setting.
If possible, I'd like to reserve the remaining

an internal communication within the office, and that
