14

that the Court gives under the heading of multiplier,

15

which begins on page 38a of the Appendix, consists of

16

three conclusory paragraphs in which it simply states as

17

a conclusion that they find that in fact there was a

18

high quality of representation.

19

importance is the Court’s holding in Blum that absent

20

rare circumst.ances, quality of representation and result

21

22

and difficulty of the issues also cited by the District

MR. WALDMAN*

is it your view that is

It is in my opinion. Justice

11

Stevens, because unlike the hypothetical that you give

12

where a private party is free to enter into any

most dubious litigation, we are here dealing with cases

where Congress only intended

done I will figure out what’s fair, and we’ll talk about

it, and at the end of the work I think back and I think,

certainly one would assume this reflects both the skill

MR. CRAWFORDs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
I had suspartad that this argument might

13

involved a great deal of the facts of this case, and in

14

that sense the case is really not certwcrthy because you

15

have a District Court required to deal with factors that

16

were going to be announced by this Court long after the

17

decision was rendered.

18

The argument plainly has not turned that way.

19

The argument has turned on the question left open in

20

Blum, and I would address that primarily here.

21

The question which is posed is should a

because the lodestar has not been adjusted, contingency

2

must be awarded, must be a factor in the determination

of a fee.

4

The first answer, of course, is the intention

5

of Congress, and Congress, when it did its most

6

comprehensive study of the fee shifting statutes, in

7

dealing with Section 1988, went to some District Court

8

cases and one 1 ending Court of Appeals case in the Fifth

9

Circuit and said this is the kind of factor we are

10

looking at.

11

Johnson, of course, turned back to the ABA standards,

12

and one of the factors that they said was used in

13

determining what is a reasonable attorney's fee was the

14

contingent nature of the case, whether the fee is fixed

or contingency.

that contingency is a factor in setting fees, and

Congress has refused to change it, even in the face of

15

The traditional rule, Justice

16

Marshall, that one of the factor that courts have used

17

all over the country in determining now you build a fee

18

is if the lodestar rates that are set are the rates you

19

would set when you were sure of getting paid,

HR. CRAWFDRDi

There are some cases, the

that had contingency as a factor in them.

me very clear here wnece the rates run from a high of

can and do look at what you call a contingency factor in

doesn't that take care of most of these cases?
MR. CRAWF33D*

I don't know whether it takes

care of most of these cases, Justice O'Zonnor.

nc question that if the Court had turned rather than to

business, the Court had turned tc people who had

contingency built into their rates to look,

You don't get paid double fcr

If the Court had said what do people

charge when they realize they

21

for five years from the start of the case, they are not

going to get paid anything, and they said, well, we have

that, that would be fine.

I’d like to touch a little on the portion of

the facts of this case that make this an obvious case

MR. CRAWFORD;

QUESTIONS

That may well be true, Justice

QUESTIONS

to the place where the regulations are being made and

6

I think it is perfectly obvious

But I will go on past that and talk about what

7

seems to me to be the final question here.

^he one

8

thing that all three of the judges in the court below

9

were clearly in agreement on was that you can’t reverse

10

this case out of haul.

11

Judge Bechtle didn’t foresee all of the points that were

12

going to be developed in Blum v.

13

he didn’t touch base just right on the language we hold

14

it against him, and the way he built the fee -- and this

15

is what you’re doing you're building a fee,

16

what a lawyer does or a judge acting for a lawyer in

17

setting a reasonable attorney’s fee here, the way you

18

build a fee is you wor,.

You can’t simply say because

Don’t you think it sounds better tc

I’ll take computing a fee, but

22

it makes it sound more mechanical than I believe the

setting of a reasonable attorney’s fee is, Justice

Judge Becker,

who dissented in the Court

10

below, said what you’ve get to do is you've got to send

11

it down to Judge Bechtle and let him look into the

12

guestion of whethar ne's built contingency into the

13

rates, whether the rates are reasonable under Plum v.

14

Stenscn was in his reading.

15

said, and I think this is absolutely correc :, Judge

16

Bechtle had the foresigiit to anticipate where this Court

17

was going in Blum, ha cited the right factors, his

discussion is not three paragraphs; his di.c cussion' is a

It seems to me that at the very least, if this

matter should go bar< to the Third Circuit and from them

rules you operate with,

fairly compensate so that you will continue to get able

lawyers in the bar doing what they should do because,

contrary to what Ms . Oberly says, we've had enough

people doing these cases because in thirteen circuits,

over many years, there was the possibility among other

NR. WALDMAN;

I would say that the

was in fact that we bore a heavy burden of proof.

22

was that where in fact there is a contingent fee

agreement, a contract,

24

But ths courts have neld where there is no contract for
