found, almost as a per se rule, then a qualified

Before we begin our argument,

3

I think it is

which we believe that this Court has articulated

governing an Eighth Amendment violation in a prison

QUESTIONS

12

Nr. Attorney General, I hate to

13

interrupt you, but the Eighth Amendment is the only one

i4

involved in this case?
KB. FROHNKAfER:

15

We contend that it is.

16

Justice Narshall.

It was the one that was argued

17

below.

18

understood the due process argument to nave been

19

advanced only becaure the due process clause was the

20

vehicle of incorporating the Eighth Amendment guarantee

21

as against the states.

We have understood and the District Court

QUESTION:

22

Mr. -Frohnmayer, do you think the

23

due process clause imposes some separate obligation

24

applicable to the use of excessive force in this

25

situation?

Would that be another way to analyze the

2

MR. FROHNMAYER;

Justice O'Connor/ we do not

3

believe that the — that that adds anything to the

4

analysis that would flow otherwise under the Eighth

5

Amendment.

6

QUESTION;

Well, do you think the standard

7

should be the same if looked at under the due process

8

clause for use cf excessive force as for Eighth

9

Amendment purposes?

10

MR. FROHNMAYER :

Well, if it is a prison

11

context, then I would

12

13

is analyzed, or at least if the due process clause is

14

considered the analysis —

Why is that for a single incident

16

that seems to have very little to do with conditions of

17

imprisonment or with any aspect of punishment?

18

MR. FROHNMAYER;

19

QUESTION;

Well --

This is more or less a single

20

incident in the process of patting down a prison riot,

21

isn't it ?

22

MR. FROHNMAYER;

It is a single incident, but

23

the incident implicates the cere of what it is that a

24

prison is all about, which is the maintenance of

25

security of people who are very dangerous people.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

And

1

so in that sense, I believe that this Court's analysis

2

in Fhodes v. Chapman would consider it as an Eighth

3

Amendment issue.

4

if that were the mode of analysis of this Court, we

5

would conclude that there should be no difference in the

6

analysis, that the tests ultimately would resolve

7

themselves to the same result, and that that would be

8

done by virtue of analyzing whether it was wanton,

9

whether or not it was unnecessary in the sense that it

Under the due process clause, however,

10

lacked a penological purpose, and whether or not what

11

was done was within the range of professional

12

discretion.
And each of those things has been examined by

13
14

this Court in the dre process context, we believe, in

15

Bell v. Wolfish, Bl< ck and Rutherford, but the Eighth

16

Amendment, focusing as it does on punishment and

17

conditions of confinement, is the mode of analysis in

18

which tnis case was argued at the beginning and which we

19

believe is most appropriate for its disposition.

Brennan.

Not a due process case.

And what standard do you think the Court of

1

Appeals for the Ninth Circuit applied?

2

MR. FROHNMAYERi

I think that the standard

3

that was applied took pieces of what purports to be an

4

Eighth Amendment test, but in the application of that

5

test to what actually happened, as revealed by the

6

record, in fact diluted it and watered it down.

7

think the Ninth Circuit did essentially was adopt a

8

reasonableness test, a hindsight reasonableness test.

9

QUESTIONc

It used

What I

the term "reasonableness"

10

and "reasonable" several times, but it also referred to

11

our decision in Estelle where a deliberate indifference

12

was a standard.

13

Appeals for the Ninth Circuit used both of those

14

standards more or less interchangeably.

So it seemed to me that the Court of

MR. FRQHNMAYEPs

15

We think that it did, and we

16

think that that is, that is the flaw of the Ninth

Circuit's decision because it's one thing tc articulate

19

this Court.

20

incorrectly.

21

Circuit.

22

It is quite another to apply them
And the latter is the flaw of the Ninth

And as we understand what it did, it

23

essentially evolves into a reasonableness test because

24

the test of excessiveness as we look at the Ninth-

25

Circuit is simply was there some less forceful

alternative that might have worked.

2

case, then a jury question on the reasonableness of the

3

course of action that was chosen is presented.

4

If that were

the

We believe that is not what this Court meant

5

by the deliberate indifference test nor by the ether

6

tests suggesting that the wanton infliction of pain or

7

unnecessary in the sense that there is no penological is

8

the appropriate test.

9

I hope I have been responsive to your question

10

because I think it is the application of the test that

11

constitutes the error made by the Ninth Circuit.

12

QUESTION:

The Court does purport to apply

13

both standards and more or lass homogenizes the two

14

standards, doesn't it?

15
16

MR. FEOHNMAYER:

That is correct, that is

correct indeed.

17

We are mindful, of course, that there is a

18

core set of values of the Eighth Amendment that have

19

been variously described as prohibitions against

20

cruelty, barbarism or sadistic torture.

21

also that there is an evolutionary aspect, whether one

22

talks about Weems, Trop v. Dulles or others of the

23

Eighth Amendment test, such that the -- there must be

24

some kind of social consensus about the excess of the

25

punishment that is imposed.

We are mindful

1 2
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

But taking all of this Court's recent

2

decisions, we believe that there is a three part test

3

that should govern cases of the kind presented here,

4

whether they are isolated outbreaks of prison violence

5

or whether they go to the question of prison

6

conditions*

7

must be wanton in the sense that it is the senseless,

8

irrational infliction of pain.

9

unnecessary in the sense that it serves no valid

first of all, that the action that is taken

10

penological purpose.

11

the range of acceptable professional discretion which

12

this Court has granted to prison administrators, but

13

which has its limits also.

14

And third,

Secondly, it must be

it must fall outside

Our first proposition obviously is that there

15

is no proof in this record that a jury would have

16

considered that there was wanton infliction of pain.

17

This Court has used adjectives such as gross or extreme

18

or harsh or gratuitous, all of which stem from the

19

historic roots in application of the Eighth Amendment

20

guarantee, even going back to the petition cf Wright.

21

The Ninth Circuit, we believe, as my colloquy

22

with Justice Powell I hope has demonstrated, that the

23

Ninth Circuit has distorted this to say that if a lesser

24

level of force might have sufficed, then the case must

25

go to the jury.

For Albers, on the other hand,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

apparently any evidence of unreasonableness will do.

2

This is really importing a tort-like cast into the

3

Eighth Amendment's jurisprudence, and whatever else it

4

may do, we believe that the Eighth Amendment does not

5

import the restatement of torts into constitutional

6

litigation, because under either test which has been

7

advanced or mixtures of the test which have been

8

advanced, any evidence of a possibly less fcrceful

9

alternative would

present a jury question,

and

10

therefore, virtually any time an inmate is injured by

11

the use of force in the quelling of a prison riot,

12

would be a jury question undar the Eighth Amendment.

13

This we believe cannot be correct.

14

there

Our second proposition is that Albers' injury

15

was not inflicted unnecessarily,

16

without penological justification.

17

central purpose for prisons, it is the maintenance of

18

security, and it takes only the -earning of Hudson v.

19

Palmer from which that is virtually a direct quote in

20

order to establish that proposition.

21

that is to say wholly
If there is one

It was objectively clear from the

22

circumstances, however favorably the record is read in

23

favor of Respondent Albers, that any inmate who went up

24

the stairs after an unarmed guard who was attempting to

25

rescue a hostage presented an objective threat to the
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

success of the rescue operation, and if that is the

2

case, then the plan had to account for that.

3

subjetive expectations of Respondent Albers are in that

4

sense constitutionally irrelevant to the fact cf the

5

plan that had been formulated.

6

The

And let us bear in mind that if too little

7

force had been used, again with our virtues of

8

hindsight, and if Albers had been of another mindset or

9

if in fact he had ascended the top of the stairs,

there

10

might well have been two hostages or two dead hostages

11

or weapons in the control of those who --

12

QUESTION*

General Frchnmayer, is there an

13

element of kind of command decision in your reasoning

14

that this is a little bit like war, at least, and that

15

perhaps the prison officials may be entitled to

16

sacrifice or injure one prisoner if it means that

17

several hostages will thereby be released?

18

MR. FROHNMAYER i

They should consider those

19

alternatives, Justice Rehnquist, but there is an element

20

of choice of evils about it.

21

side’s own enemies are injured by friendly fire.

22

situation where there is a crisis, there is an

23

emergency, and where every alternative is full cf risk

24

and danger, where there are no risk-free alternatives,

25

it is possible that that result could occur.

and in the very reason that you give deference and tell

lower courts to give deference to prison administrators,

we expect them to act as professionals, and that’s what

8

happened here.

We are not asking for a promiscuous delegation

persons who are helpless because they are incarcerated.

12

The facts of this record bespeak the rationality and

justice of what was done.

Mr. Attorney General, could I

clearly in mind.

comment on that.

time that the action was — took place?

9

Is the record subject to a different

MB. FROHNMAYERi

It is susceptible to that as

10

a conclusion but not as a fact.

11

taking the record in the most favorable light to

12

Respondent, he's entitled to a favorable gloss on the

13

fact but not to ignore the facts, and the facts that

14

remain, there was still a hostage, there was still a

threat to that hostage's life.

The state has presented a distorted picture of

10

announced by the Ninth Circuit and the position that

11

Albers is taking in this case.

12

With this in mind, I wish to discuss the legal

13

standard which is not a minimal tort standard which

Albers proposes, and then we can look at the facts and

However, even though this is not a Fourth Amendment

MR. MECHANICS

Correct, but it was in the

context of a discussion, of course, of the Eighth

Amendment’s application to the paddling of students in

school.

6

So I am not suggesting that we need to come to

7

•che same conclusion on the standard.

8

suggesting that the interest to life that Gerald Albers

9

had was certainly as significant as the interest to life

I am only

10

that Edwin Garner had when ha was shot while he was

11

trying to climb over the wall by a police officer who

12

knew that he committed a nighttime burglary, which is a

13

very serious offense.

14

Now,

the fight we have in this case is what

say there was a deliberate use of deadly force?

3

MR. MECHANIC;

Yes.

I believe that we can’t

make a distinction constitutionally when a police

officer takes a firearm and shoots, even though they are

attempting to shoot low, and we think that a jury should

consider that,

The fact is Albers was hit, he bled severely,
