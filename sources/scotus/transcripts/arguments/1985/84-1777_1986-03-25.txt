ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MS. BERZOtU

Thank ycu, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

In this case, the UAW sued on behalf of its

11

members to overturn a directive issued by the Secretary

12

cf Labor that resulted in denying trade readjustment

13

allowance, or TRA benefits, to thousands of UAW

14

members.

15

a single federal question, whether the Secretary cf

16

Labor's interpretation of federal law was in error, and

17

if so, tc direct the Secretary through his agents tc

18

correct that error by reconsidering under a proper,

19

standard claims denied under the invalid directive.

20

The DA

.equested the district court to decide

The district court agreed with us that the

21

Secretary's directive in facted violated federal law,

22

and that thousands of UAW members had in fact been

23

illegally denied TRA benefits and granted the requested

24

relief .

25

On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals did

not reach the merits of this controversy, nor did it

2

reach any number of procedural defenses raised by the

3

government, some for the first time in the Court of

4

Appeals.

5

cn an issue that had never previously teen raised,

6

principally on this issue,

7

had standing tc litigate this case at all.

and that is whether the UAW

It is this standing issue that we have brought

8
9

Instead, the Court of Appeals decided the case

tc this Court on certiorari, principally, and that is

10

before this Ccurt today.

If, as we believe it must,

11

this Court reverses on that issue and decides that the

12

UAR may in fact serve as the collective vcice cf its

13

members in this litigation, then the other procedural

14

issues wculd be opened cn remand in the Ccurt of

15

Appeals.
What this says is that the issue before this

16
17

Court is considerably simpler than the government's

18

brief might suggest.

19

remainder of the issues are procedural issues opened cn

20

There is a standing issue, and

Well, Ms. Eerzon, you are speaking

generally of what you call procedural issues.
Is the question of whether this is a proper

I don’t know hew you define

subject matter jurisdiction, but at any rate, address

9

yourself to the question I asked you.

10

MS. BERZONi

I think I am, and that is whether

11

in fact there is review under federal question

12

jurisdiction of federal questions concerning Trade Act

13

benefits, or whether the Trade Act itself requires that

14

all such questions be decided in state court, and our

15

answer to that question is that what the Secretary cf

16

Labor keeps asserting, that there is something in the

17

Trade Act that requires that the questions be decided in

18

state court,

19

the Trade Act says in Section 239(d) is that

20

determinations with respect to eligibility for benefits

21

are to be decided in

22

extent as determinations under the state unemployment

23

insurance law.

24

review is to be in state court or under state law.

25

Instead, it sets up a comparative standard.

3

US. BERZONs

In this instance, the relief did,

4

for reasons related both to the fact that the UAH was

5

the plaintiff and I think took proper regard for the

6

state system and for the administration of the district

7

court, decide only the single federal question and

8

remand all claims back to the administrative system.

9

But that's the same thing that would have happened had

10

the case gone up in a state court, the state —

11

QUESTION*

Yes, but what you're saying is that

12

these players can split off one issue in the question of

There is an injunction here.

QUESTION*

19

This is not a declaratory

Well, okay.

The Secretary

By an injunction,

which is an even more extraordinary remedy.

21

MS. BERZON*

Because the reason for that is

22

that what we are challenging is not an action by the

23

state.

24

Secretary of Labor in this case requires that the states

25

follow its statutory interpretations.

It is an action by the Secretary of labor.

case tc te contending that we ought to have stayed in
the state administrative systam because what happened
here is that while these claims were in fact pending

not to the agency in general, tut to the Chairman of the
Appeals Board, and told the Chairman of the Appeals
Ecard

that if the Appeals Beard decided in favor cf the

claimants, that the, first, that the Federal Government
would pay, second, that the state was going to have to
pay out of its own funds, third, that the state’s entire
unemployment insurance system could be decertified with
enormous tax consequences for the employers in the
state.
To say that under those circumstances we are
to sit there and continue tc deal with the state
administrative system which has been completely biased
by the Secretary cf Labor asserting itself —

Hell, do you — are you suggesting

that the validity of the Secretary’s directive just

MS. BERZOR*

As to administrative exhaustion

position is that there is nothing about the joint

17

MS. BERZONs

So those defenses would be open in

With one comment, and that is

18

that in this instance the Court of — the government

19

expressly waived an exhaustion defense, and we would

20

maintain that the district court's finding cf futility

21

is one that would have to be respected, for the

22

circumstances that I outlined earlier with respect tc

23

what in fact happened here on exhaustion, and with

24

respect tc the statute of limitations, there was a

25

waiver there as well because there was no affirmative

The important thing for the present purposes,

2
3

however, is that neigher exhaustion ncr the statute cf

MS. PERZONi

2

He would maintain that this case

3

4

QUESTIONi

5

6

Well, that is down the road, I

suppose.

7

MS. BERZONs

My very point. Justice White, is

8

that it is down the read, and that what we have here is

9

an extremely threshold issue.

We were dismissed in the

10

Court cf Appeals for none of the reasons that we are

11

discussing now, all of which would be opened on remand,

12

tut instead, on the representation, on the conclusion

13

that the DAW simply could not prosecute this case at

14

all.

15

Looking at that issue, the basic purpose cf a

16

standing inquiry is to be sure that the party that is in

17

court can present the case in a proper, traditional

18

adversary manner.

19

the party seeking to get his complaint before the Court

20

and not in addition on the issues he wishes tc have

21

adjudicated.

22

As Flast v.

Ms. Eerzon, are there cases you can

23

point to on which a union has been granted associational

24

standing when it challenged conditions that are not

25

cn-the-jcb conditions of employees?
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MS. BERZONi

1

Yes.

We cite at the teginning cf

2

cur opening brief a nurrber cf such cases, including a

3

number in this Court.

4

Company, one of the litigants was a union.

5

Public Officers v. Mitchell, although the standing issue

6

was not decided there, and there a number of others

7

cf — there are a number cf CSFA cases in this Court

8

which

For example, in Duke Power
In United

were litigated by unions.
QUESTION*

9

Well, but I think that conditions

10

of safety on the job or health

standards cr

11

discrimination are job, on-the-job conditions, and I’m

12

curious how this fits in.
For example, would the union have standing, in

13
14

yccr view, to file a suit tc secure Focd Stamps for

15

employees who are substandard in income or something

16

like that?

17

MS. BFF.ZONs

I think it would depend net cn

18

whether the name of the organization was union, but cn

19

what the organization, whatever it was called, defined

20

as its own purposes, and in this case we have an

21

explicit declaration cf purpose in the HAW constitution,

22

we have a long tradition of involvement with this

23

particular program and with government benefits for

24

unemployed people in general.

QUESTIONS

Nell, then, how about Feed Stamps?

2

Would the union be able to have associational standing

3

to bring —

4

MS. BERZONc

I think it would depend on

5

whether that could be construed as being within the

6

purposes of that organization,

7

history and by its governing documents, and not by

8

whether the name of the organization was union.

9

as governed by its

In this instance I think there is no doubt

10

that these particular benefits were squarely within the

11

union’s purposes, and indeed, there is express

12

authorization and indeed some measure of responsibility

13

upon the union to represent members with respect to

14

unemployment benefits.

15

Indeed, the decision to act collectively here

16

was one that came from the involvement of this union in

17

the Trade Act for a while, from the fact that it was

18

representing individuals throughout the ccur.try in

19

obtaining benefits, and from the fact that it turned cut

20

that the single reason for denying benefits was

21

recurring repeatedly, and when inquiry was made, we

22

discovered that there was a directive from the Secretary

23

of Labor that was in fact governing the benefits, and in

24

addition, discovered that the biasing of the state

25

administrative assistants were going on, and it was for
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that reason that the members of the DAW joined together

2

tc do something that none of them, could have done on

3

their own, and that was to bring a major federal lawsuit

4

challenging the Secretary of Labor.
This joining together to enhance the voice cf

5

6

individual members is within long political tradition

7

and constitutional tradition of this country, and this

8

is a perfect example of that process.
Consequently, when the Court cf Appeals held

9

10

that the UAW did not have standing in this case, it was

11

going against a long line of cases in this court

12

summarized relatively recently by the Chief Justice for

13

this Court in Hunt v. Washington State Advertising

14

Commission.

15

requirements for finding that there — an organization

16

can in fact represent its members, and in this case, the

17

conclusion that we were satisfying all three of these

18

prongs of the Hunt inquiry is really relatively simple.

19

First of all, the first requirement is that the

20

individuals have standing.

In Hunt, the Court stated three

There is really nc question here as to that if

21

22

looked at as it properly should be as a standing

23

inquiry.

24

members that were denied this money, and money is the

25

most concrete sort of injury that one can imagine.

There was direct injury to thousands of cur

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Similarly, only I think I covered the second germaneness

2

requirement of Hunt in answer tc Justice C’Ccnncr’s

3

questions; and the third prcno of Hunt, therefore,

4

the focus, it seems to us, of the Court of Appeals*

5

concern.

6

individual participation either with respect to the

7

claim for relief or with respect to the belief itself.

8
9

That prong is whether there is any need fcr

And in this instance it seems that there were
several things bothering the Court of Appeals, none of

10

which have any validity as a reason why individual

11

participation is necessary.

12

is

First of all, the Court mentioned that the

13

relief granted might affect different members

14

differentially, and that is, of course, true, but it is

15

true not only in any organizational standing case but in

16

any 23(b)(2) class action, and this Court expressly

17

noted in Califano v. Yamasaki that it is one of the

18

strengths cf collective litigation of this kind that it

19

is possible tc focus only on the joint uniform problem

20

and to leave the individual adjudications tc an

21

administrative system, which is what happened here.

22

Similarly, the fact that monetary relief was

23

involved is of no consequence.

This Court in Schweiker

24

v. Gray Panthers expressly recognized

25

monetary relief, there in the form of future prospective

standing to obtain

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

benefits on behalf of members.

Similarly, the fact that

2

the relief is in some sense retrospective in that it

3

reopens old claims or it regards claims that have

4

already once teen decided is again net relevant to the

5

standing inquiry.

6

inquiry because, as Warth noted, the basic question is

7

whether or not the Court will have to determine any cf

8

the individual matters involved, and as Warth also

9

noted, it would therefore even be possible to award

It is not relevant to the standing

10

that is what happened here.

Finally, the government tries to support the

Court's retrospectivity finding on the grounds of this

Court's recent case of Green v. Kansour.

17

Kansour, as its language confirms, is deeply imbedded in

the Eleventh Amendment and has no viable existence

outside cf the Eleventh Amendment context here, there is

no Eleventh Amendment consideration because we are

It did.

It came to that

conclusion on the basis of a construction of 239(d),

The government dees claim that there is scire

is the governing rule, why the states have tc be joined,

may it please the Court!

2

The principal issue in this case, cf course,

3

is whether Petitioner United fluto Workers has standinq

4

to bring the suit and tc seek the relief requested

5

here.

6

Christian and because the Petitioners make sc much cf

7

that case, perhaps I should first explain that Christian

8

does not hold that the sort of claim splitting that was

9

done here can be undertaken.

But because this Court has inquired about

Christian first of all is

10

a classic collateral order type of case within the

11

meaning cf Ma thews v. Eldridge.

The principle at issue

12

there had to do with procedure.

Mere than that, it

13

didn’t just have to do with state procedure, it had tc

14

do with a procedure that the federal agency would have

15

to go through with respect to redetermination or reasons

16

why persons were tried.

17

QUESTIONj

Wasn’t Christian a mandamus?

18

HS. KUBL«

That’s another basis fer

19

distinguishing it, Justice White.

The question — the

20

jurisdictional question that was raised there and is

21

articulated in that case and discussed is whether

22

mandamus jurisdiction is available with respect to a

23

suit against a federal officer, not on the basis cf the

24

Constitution.

25

Furthermore, in that case the Ccurt also
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

suggested cn remand that the Court might want to held

2

the case open and let the state administrative process

3

gc forward to further ripen

4

these reasons we don't believe that Christian, et al. is

5

some kind of a sweeping holding that under 239(d) cases

6

issues can he plucked out of state proceedings and taken

7

into federal court.
Because the United Auto Workers has alleged no

8
9

the suit, so that for all

injury to itself as an organization here, it must

10

satisfy the requirements for representative standing

11

that are set forth in Hunt v. Washington Apple

12

Advertising Commission.

13

that the Petitioner has net satisfied the Hunt

14

requirements, and in the alternative, we suggest that

15

the Hunt test does not really fully address the concerns

16

raised by the standing issue in the context cf this

17

case,

18

action principles to inform its representative standing

19

doctrine .

20

In our argument we show, first,

and that the Court might wish to look to class

As has been stated, returning to Hunt,

the

21

Hunt test has three parts;

22

be able to sue in their own right; second, whether the

23

interests that the union seeks to protect are germane to

24

the organization's purpose; and third, whether the claim

25

asserted and the relief reguested require the

first, whether members would

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

participation of individual mambers in the lawsuit.
And we have argued that the Petitioners have
not satisfied any of the three prongs of Hunt.
Turning to the first prong cf Hunt, then,
whether members can sue in their own right,

we have

shown in our brief that no member would have been able
tc bring an action similar to this case.

Petitioners'

primary argument in reiuttal is that we have gone tcc
far in asking that someone actually he able to come into
court and bring suit.

They say that it should be enough

that some member show injury to itself.

But actually,

the Petitioners' own assertions in their brief disprove
their argument because in their reply brief they have
disclaimed any desire to represent those persons who
went through the state administrative process and then
went to state court and were denied benefits in state
court and say we have no desire tc represent those
people here.

That certainly suggests to us that they

are admitting that something more than just inquiry is
required under the Warth test, and that Warth really
looks to whether someone could bring a justiciable
case -- and these are — that is the language cf Warth.
It requires that a justiciable case be able tc be
identified with respect to a union member.

That's correct.

That is what we

are suggesting.

QUESTION*

-- that would be valid?

6

iSS. KUHL:

I'm sorry?

7

QUESTION*

It just seemed to me that that was

8

a rather extreme position tc take, and that surely there

9

were some members of the anion who themselves

10

individually would still have a valid claim tc make --

11

MS. KUHL*

Well

12

QUESTION:

At least would have standing.

13

MS. KUHLi

Well, but what we are saying is

14

that what Warth requires goes beyond injury.

15

requires that someone, there actually be some member who

16

could come into court and bring suit, and we have

17

actually narrowed it down new tc two groups cf people

18

that the Petitioners suggest among their members would

19

be able tc come into ccurt.

20

members who pursued their claim through the state

21

administrative process but did not go to court would be

22

able tc come in, and secondly, they suggest that members

23

who began but did not complete the state administrative

24

process would be able tc come in.

25

It

First, they suggest that

But both those groups include persons, first,
25

who would be estopped by administrative collateral,
collateral estoppel, because they would have let
their -- they would

have intentionally abandoned their

claims, having gone to the administrative process, they
would have dropped out at seme stage.
QUESTION!

Am I incorrect that some state

proceedings have been held in abeyance pending cur
esolution of this case, and so that there are probably
some individual members cut there who still have a valid
claim?
MS. KUHLs

Well, seme state proceedings, I

believe it was a state court proceeding, though, that
was held in abeyance, not the administrative proceeding,
and they have suggested that people who gc to state
court are not the people — that people who are in state
court are really not the people that they are interested
in representing.

It is the

people in the administrative

process.
QUESTION*

Eut if there is scmecne in a state

court somewhere in the 50 states who is challenging this
thing, I would think that that person would have
standing under the traditional definition.
MS. KUHL;

Nc, we don’t believe sc because

that person would not be able to forgo the state process
and then leave that and go intc federal court to make

15

MS. KUHLs

for the state court to stay its processes pending seme

that Warth v. Sullivan requires something mere than that

that no individual member would have the right to come

MS. KUHL*

QUESTION:

Well, of course, the district

courty can't bind the state agencies because they
weren't parties, I take it.
8S. KOHL*

That's correct. Justice Behnquist,

and that is a reason why the district, or the court
below,

the Court of Appeals was correct with regard tc

requiring the joinder of the state agencies.
The Secretary can direct the state agencies,
and state agencies are by contract agents of the
secretary, tut what is going tc be required here is that
a lot of state manpower be marshalled and files gene
through, and if the state agency does not comply, the
Secretary can order and can ask and maybe can take ever
the process, but there is not going toi be any kind of
ability for direct control ly the district court here.
Although we believe that we should prevail
under the three-part Hunt test, it has seemed to us that
the Hunt test leaves unaddressed some very important
issues that arise in this litigation and that have
arisen In other cases.

This case has evolved to raise

some very difficult issues concerning adequacy of
representation and collateral estoppel effect of the
judgment, and I hasten tc add that by adequacy of

which

The district court's order covers non-UAW

disclaims any desire to represent non-UAW members.

Furthermore, the district court order also covers UAW

broader argument that class certification procedures

11

should be looked to in cases of this sort, there is a

12

benefit tc the government gcing into litigation and

13

knowing what is at stake in the case, and there is also

14

a benefit tc the government at the end cf the litigation

15

to have some assurance that there will be a collateral

estoppel effect with regard to the outcome cf the

17

litigation.
We also think that there is a benefit to

19

litigants generally to having litigation conducted in a

20

way that assures some adequacy of representation with

21

regard to different groups whose interests are at
