that we have a viable damage claim for being put out of

saves us from mootness as well.

22

we believe

It seems to me, though, that the ultimate

23

answer to mootness is that the city's argument appears

24

tc be that, if we have granted you a franchise in 1S81

25

as we should have, you might not have lived up to the

The Ninth Circuit in its decision seemed not

only confused by the difference between management and

labor, but it also seemed confused because the city

10

drove us out of business by refusing to renew our

12

more sacrosanct than a decision not to grant a driver's

13

license, or to deny unemployment compensation, or to

14

grant the damage remedy.

QUESTION*

Excuse me for interrupting you

16

again, but I'm reminded in looking at my notes that I

believe the only thing that your client sought below was

18

irjunctive relief on the pre-emption claim and not

19

damages and not due process or any other claim.

21
22

So, what relief of an injunctive nature would
possibly help now, with an expired franchise?
HR. FASKAN*

Well, first of all, it seems to

23

me that a federal coart can tell the city to issue

24

and I don't think that's an extraordinary proposition

2

nor do T see how a mootness count, arises in that

3

situation, at least not a viable one.

4

Nothing in the — as I was saying, the Ninth

5

Circuit seemed also confused because of the franchise

6

issue in this case, but nothing about a franchise.

7

Nothing in the inherent nature of a franchise in the

8

Court's opinions, in logic, indicates that the denial of

9

a franchise or the exercise of local franchising

10

authority should be treated any differently for

11

pre-emption purposes.

12

Franchising, it seams to me — refusing to

13

renew or extend our franchise in this case was merely

14

the means by which the city imposed its will upon us and

15

drove us out of business for failing to settle the labor

16

disputes within the time allotted.

It's another thing for the city tc say, you

have a strike right now and therefore you're cut cf

6

this city.

7

And it seems to me,

that's the critical

8

difference.

9

merely defining what I call the naked public interest

What they're doing here, it seems to me, is

10

and saying that the public interest of the City of Los

11

Angeles is that companies that do business with us

12

cannot have strikes.

13

with us, that do business within the city, that service

14

our consumers,

15

And,

And that is not, that do business

cannot have strikes.
that's a decision that I think Congress

16

has foreclosed.

18

inconvenience that sometimes flows from strikes.

Yes.

Right.
By a time certain.

I would have

15

more trouble with that, but I don’t think that’s this

16

case.

I honestly don’t know how I would come cut on

17

that.

But I think there’s a clear distinction,, at least

18

to me, between a situation where they're just saying,

19

you can go out, you're authorized to operate in the

20

marketplace, and where the City has some finite goal,

21

building a building, building a swimming pool before the

22

Olympics where timely performance is an element of what

23

they 're doing.

24
25

That’s not what we have here.

What we have

here is merely a company that was seeking to continue

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

serving the consumers of Los Angeles, and that seems to

2

me a determinative difference in this case.

3

The critical point for us about this case is

4

that the City, at the behest of the Teamsters Union,

5

forced us to choose between our position in collective

6

bargaining and remaining in business, and it's our

7

position that that choice cannot be imposed consistently

8

with the federal labor laws.

9

Our labor laws are premised upon a notion of

10

private industrial dispute settlement, the process of

11

free and voluntary collective bargaining, in which

12

management and labor resolve their disputes free from

13

government interference, is the keystone of the federal

14

scheme to promote industrial peace.

15

QUESTION*

Does Lor. Angeles have a limited

16

number of taxicabs, or do they just give a franchise to

17

any company that comes along that shows it*s able to

18

operate taxicabs?

HR. FASMAN*

they have a limit on the number of cabs, it certainly

This Court's opinions also

10

entitled to rely upon their economic strength in a labor

dispute.

12

In 1935 Congress expressly granted labor

the

13

right to strike, implicitly granted management

14

corresponding rights including the right to replace, the

15

right to lock out, and Congress thereby struck a balance

16

between the interests of management, labor* employees

17

and the general public.

Ms. Fasman, incidentally, was any

No, Justice Rlackmun, there was

never any unfair labor practice charge filed, although

as we've made clear the Teamsters did come before the

24

faith, but they never took that to the Board.

But, Congress has never varied from the

6

fundamental premise that management and labor are

7

entitled to engage in economic warfare and that the

8

national interest requires that the public tolerate

9

disruption that arises from strikes and labor disputes.

10

Indeed, each time Congress has considered the

11

question it has reaffirmed its original decision that

12

there should be free collective bargaining and free

13

resort to economic weaponry by management and labor.

14

In 1947 Congress defeated proposals to impose

a regime of compulsory arbitration upon local utilities

including local transportation companies.

The Ninth Circuit created a pre-emption test

limiting pre-emption to those two circumstances the

There is absolutely no —

This is just a decision of the City of Los Angeles not

MR. FASMAH*

9

It isn't quite the same thing.
Sell, it isn't quite the same

10

drawing between direct and indirect regulation, while

11

understandable, has not fazed the court before.

to support that.

The Ninth Circuit clearly said

twice, and there is ample evidence in the record

10

It's plainly not clearly erroneous.

Indeed, the finding of the district court,

the

11

initial district court finding that this is what

12

happened, was affirmed twice by the Ninth Circuit and I

13

think the attempt tc inject a factual argument at this

14

point in the case is plainly wiong for the reasons we've

15

outlined in the reply brief.

Let me aid one final thought.

HE. FASHAHs

Well, first of all. Justice

3

O’Connor, that is not what the Ninth Circuit said.

4

the Ninth Circuit said was, and I quote from page 7-A of

5

the petition, nothing in the record indicates that the

6

City’s refusal to renew or extend Golden State’s

7

franchise until an agreement was reached and operations

resumed was not concerned with transportation, no

They're saying that the decision not to renew,

not to extend until you settle the strike miaht have

Well, it was just a bit ambiguous,

and might have been intended to suggest that there were

trying to improve the transportation situation.

The case is on summary judgment,

I think tha proper test is that when

exercising a routine governm~ntal power which has an

evidence, is the action taken reasonably connected to

the effectuation of the legitimate governmental goal,

8

and in this case the facts support that particular test.

I think it is the City's business to have a

10

good taxicab system.

11

on this matter, the Petitioner had been on strike for 40

days.

No, I'm just saying — I'm not

14

suggesting that was the reason.

15

evidence — first of all, I should say that I'm not

16

arguing what the motive of the Council was or was not.

17

What I’m arguing —

QUESTION;

I*m saying there's

Therefore you're saying that

whatever the motive was, it was right?

20

MR. HAGGERTY;

That based on the record in

21

this case, the evidence before the City Council

22

indicating there were sufficient cabs on the street,

23

that the Council acted properly in not renewing the

24

f ranchise.

25

And the debate before the Council shows that

the Council members were very concerned about the effect

of their action.

members, lengthy discussions,

4

the public interest, and the Council members even state

in their the Council members never even stated in their

remarks —

There is discussion by the Council

about the desire to act in

That certainly is asking for

8

affirmance on a completely different ground, and that

9

would have been an awfully easy way for the City to

10

dispose of the whole case, from the time of the

11

preliminary injunction hearing on up to any of the

12

courts.

MR. HAGGERTY»

The district court did not find

20

that, but in the first court of appeals decision

21

reversing or vacating the granting of the preliminary

22

injunction, the court pointed out that the motive for

23

the City Council was irrelevant.

24
25

Petitioner argued that the motive of the
Council was to assist the Teamsters, and it was the

(202) 628-9300

1

City's position that that was irrelevant.

2

what the motive was, and since the City was in no

3

position to claim that the Council's motive was

4

something different, the City wasn't in a position to

5

contradict that and say the motive was such and such as

6

opposed to what the Petitioner has urged.

7

QUESTION*

Who knows

Well, do you see a difference, Nr.

8

Haggerty, between saying that the reason the City

9

cancelled the franchise or refused to renew the

10

franchise was because Golden State was in a labor

11

dispute, that's point one, and to say that the City

12

cancelled or refused to renew the franchise because it

13

wanted to help the Teamsters in that labor dispute?

14

NR. HAGGERTY*

Yes, Your Honor, because I

15

think the record — based on wh3t the Council did, there

16

was no assistance to the Teamsters because the drivers

17

were put out of work, as well.

18

QUESTIONS

Let me just go back to this other

19

point a moment.

20

appeals, as the basis for its decision, assumed that the

21

City insisted upon a renewal — I mean, insisted upon a

22

resolution of the labor dispute as a condition of

23

renewing the franchise?

24

MR. HAGGERTY:

Isn't it correct that the court of

said the city was pursuing —

QUESTION;

I do not believe it was necessary for the
The court of appeals also

What you are saying is, they could

have decided the case in some other way?
ME. HAGGERTY;

That’s right, that the City was

pursuing a legitimate transportation policy.
QUESTION;

Yes, but on summary judgment, and

9

if there’s some evidence supporting the proposition that

10

if they went to trial they contend they could prove that

11

the only reason for the non-renewal was the labor

12

dispute, don’t we have to assume they can prove that?

13

This is a summary judgment case.

14

MR. HAGGERTY*

But again, in the test I

15

suggested to the Court I think it’s a question whether

16

or not there was substantial evidence in the record to

17

support the conclusion that the City was acting to

18

further a legitimate governmental purpose, namely

19

transportation purpose, because base-' on the evidence --

20

QUESTION;

Is that just a long way of saying

21

the question is whetner, not doing business with a

22

company that has a labor dispute is a legitimate

23

governmental purpose?

24
25

MR. HAGGERTY;

No, that is not a long way of

saying it because it would be up to the Petitioner

through objective evidence in opposition to the motion

2

for summary judgment to show that there was net

3

substantial evidence supporting the proposition —

4

QUESTTONi

Well, they have offered some such

5

evidence and it seems to me on summary judgment, we have

6

to assume that everything they offer is true and

7

everything you offer is not true.

8

to resolve all factual disputes against you, don’t we?

9

HR. HAGGERTY!

I mean, we just have

All factual disputes, but I

10

believe as a matter of law, if the evidence is such in

11

the record to show — and I'm repeating myself, I

12

realize that there was a legitimate transportation

13

purpose, then that is sufficient.

14

As to the argument made by the Petitioners as

15

to the effect test, and the guestion as to whether or

16

not the granting of this franchise was any different

17

than the granting of a contract, that arguably the

18

23

the granting of this franchise was any different than

24

the granting of a contract, that arguably the granting

25

2

Since we're talking about congressional intent

3

here, I don’t think there is any distinction made by the

4

Congress as far as the granting of a franchise and the

5

granting of a contract.

6

You could have a situation where the City was

going to grant a franchise for the collection of

garbage.

If there was a strike and it was in evidence

10

would be justified in not granting that franchise if

11

they realized that the garbage collection would not

That is

15

Petitioner is arguing based on the Machinists

a party to a labor dispute, is pre-emptive.

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it went that far

2

MR. HAGGERTY;

Well, if you use an effects

3

test as petitioner does, I believe that is petitioner's

4

argument.

5

Getting to the issue of mootness, I should

6

point out that in the record — it's not in the joint

7

appendix but in 103 of the record, the issues of law as

8

raised by the petitioner on page 16, they indicate that

9

there's two issues of law and the first issue is whether

1C

or not the defendant's denial of the plaintiff’s

11

franchise renewal was contrary to a compelling

12

Congressional direction to deprive local governments of

13

the power to interfere with public utilities engaged in

14

collective bargaining disputes, and therefore in

15

violation of the supremacy clause of the Constitution.

16

Petitioner does not argue in — at least

as

17

far as what they claim are the issues in this case, that

18

the violation or the non-granting of the tax-exempt

19

franchise and the alleged violation of the supremacy

20

clause was also a violation of the Civil Rights Act.

21

So, in conclusion, I believe it’s a situation

22

that no matter what the City did in this case, it would

23

have had an incidental effect on the labor dispute and

24

the City was within its regulatory power to take the

25

action that it did insofar as there was sufficient
