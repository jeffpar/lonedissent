CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

3

Mr. Kotler, you may proceed

whenever you are ready .
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN KOTLER, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5
6

MR. KOTLER:

Thank you.

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

8

This case raises an issue involving the interpre-

9

tation of the language chosen by Congress when it enacted

10

Section 1988 of Title 42 which provides that a trial court

11

may award a reasonable attorney's fee to a prevailing party

12

in certain civil rights actions.

13

Specifically, this case raises the question of

14

whether an award of attorney ' s fees seven times the amount

15

received by the plaintiffs in a private action resulting

16

only in monetary relief can possibly be deemed reasonable

17

under Section 1988 .

18

More broadly, this case also raises the question

19

of whether Secti on 1988 mandates some relationship between

20

the results obtained by a prevailing party in a civil rights

21

action and the fees which a trial judge may award thereafter.

22

As such, it caused them to question the effacacy

23

of the continued use of the lodestar approach to fee

24

calculations in cases which are essentially private court

25

actions .
3

It is the position of the Petitioners that the
2

lodestar approach in a case such as this, rather than

3

producing a fee which is presumptively reasonable, can

4

often, as here, produce a fee which is unreasonable on

5

its face.
QUESTION:

6

The calculation I made, counsel

7

Their request was for $495,708, is that right, their original

8

request ?
MR. KOTLER:

9
10

that doubled, the multiplier of two, yes.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. KOTLER:

13

And, the court allowed them $245,000.
Yes.

All their hours at a rate

of $125 an hour.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. KOTLER:

16

That took in the number of hours

And, what was your offer of settlement?
Our last offer of settlement was

$25, 000.

There has been a great amount in the record dis-

Yes, Your Honor.

The last offer

that was made to one of the co-counsel was $25,000.
23

It is likewise Petitioners' belief that a fee

calculated on the same basis as fees for similar litigation

25

in a given community not only provides a more accurate

reflection of the true value of legal services rendered
2

in a private 1983 case, but, moreover, would produce a

3

fee more consistent with the goals of Congress when Congress

4

enacted 1988, which is, of course, a fee that is reasonable.

QUESTION:

Mr. Kotler, you referred to a private

MR. KOTLER:

I think there are.

I think if the

benefit that is yielded as a result of an action benefits

10

more than the individual plaintiffs results in policy changes,

11

results in --

12

QUESTION:

You are talking about a case that

13

results simply in an award of a damage judgment to a

14

particular individual?
MR. KOTLER:

15

16
17

I would characterize that as a private

1988 case.
Factually, this case began following an altercation

18

between the Respondents and various members of the Riverside

19

City Police of Riverside, California, in August of 1975.

20

Thereafter, the Respondents filed an action in

21

the United States District Court for the Central District

22

of California against 32 defendants, including the City

23

of Riverside and its chief of police .

24

Their action included civil rights claims as

25

well as a mixed bag of pendent state claims, including

claims for assault and battery, claims for property damage,
2

infliction of emotional distress, malicious prosecution,

3

defamation, false arrest and false imprisonment, and simple

4

negligence.

5

In addition to seeking money damages, the

6

Respondents herein sought wide-ranging injunctive and declara

7

tory relief as well.
Ultimately the matter was tried to a jury in

8
9

1980 and when all was said and done Respondents recovered

10

jury awards against only six of the 32 defendants against

11

whom they had litigated .
No police officer above the rank of lieutenant

12
13

was found to have any liability to any of the Respondents

14

and 26 of the defendant officers, including 17 who had

15

been previously dismissed by the first trial judge assigned

16

to hear this case on summary judgment, 26 of the defendant

17

officers were found to have no liability to any of the

18

Respondents on any theory whatsoever.
QUESTION:

19

Wasn't there some problem about

20

identifying the officers responsible for the unfortunate

21

fracas?
MR. KOTLER:

23
24

25

That is correct, Justice Blackmun.

Initially there was but -QUESTION:

What would you as an attorney have

done had you represented the other side?

MR. KOTLER:

I would have taken discovery as

2

the attorneys for the other side did, and once I found

3

out who was involved, I w9uld have dismissed those that

4

were not involved.

s

other side not only refused to dismiss, but -QUESTION:

6
1

Just as you have refused to make a

larger offer and got caught under the rule.
MR. KOTLER:

8

9

However, once this was found out, the

The offer that we made was within

$8,000 of the eventual jury verdict, so I don't think it

10

was that far off, but I don't think I would have continued

11

to have litigated against people that I knew two years

12

before the trial, and that is when it was, two years before

13

the trial, had no liability or not culpability whatsoever.
Of all the claims asserted by the Respondents,

14

15

they recovered only on their Section 1983 claim and their

16

pendent state claims for false arrest, false imprisonment

17

and negligence.

18

Of all the types of relief which Respondents

19

sought-- They only recovered money damages and this in

20

the sum of $ 3 3,350.

21

No injunctive or declaratory relief issued as

22

a result of their action, and more importantly, the City

23

of Riverside was not compelled to and did not change

24

any of its policies or practices as a result of this

25

lawsuit.

In sum, the results achieved by this litigation
2

4

5

was far less than the revenue sought.
QUESTION:

Are all of the officers still employed

by the City of Riverside?
MR. KOTLER:

To my knowledge, they are, Your

6

Honor, and the one lieutenant who was found to have

7

culpability is now the chief of police.

8
9

And, yet, the district court, following these
verdicts, awarded to Respondents' attorneys fees under

10

Section 1988 for every minute of every hour they claimed

11

to have spent litigating this action against every defendant

12

sued on every claim, on every issue, and every avenue

13

of relief pursued.

14

They were fully recompensed for the time they

15

spent pursing the 26 defendants who were found to have

16

no liability, any of them.

17

for time spent pursuing claims and avenues of relief on

18

which they achieved no success whatsoever.

19

They were fully recompensed

In sum, while the jury awarded to the Respondents

20

the amount of $33,350, the trial judge awarded to their

21

attorneys an amount seven times that sum, approximating

22

a quarter of a million dollars.

23

Petitioners paid the jury award, but appealed

24

the trial judge's award of attorneys' fees to the Ninth

25

Circuit which thereafter affirmed the trial court.

QUESTION:

will stop interrupting you.

4

Counsel, one last question and I

Suppose they had recovered a verdict of half
a million dollars here, would you be making the same argument?
MR. KOTLER:

5

.

That they would be entitled to

6

a contingency or fee based on the prevailing market rates

7

for similar litigation, yes, I would.

a

I think you have a situation here --

9

QUESTION:

10

So, the amount is irrele vant then.

Your seven-times argument means nothing.

11

MR. KOTLER:

I think it would be just as outrageous

12

if it was five times or four times or three times if that

13

is what Your Honor means.
QUESTION:

14

Well, suppose -- my premise was,

15

suppose the recovery was for $500,000 and fees were allowed

16

here roughly equal to

11

fee basis would be in your state.

18

law.

19

and I thought you answered that in the affirmative.

I don't know California

My question was would you be making the same argument

MR. KOTLER:

20

what a contingency

I suppose

If the result in this case would

21

wind up being contingency fee approximating the same amount

22

here

23

or $700,000 in judgments.

24

third of whatever the contingency was because the value

25

of this case would have been $600,000 or $700,000 as

that would have to be, I guess, in about $600,000
They would be entitled to one-

judge itself.

3

So, yes.

QUESTION:

If they would have recovered $500,000,

4

the original fee that asked for was roughly equivalent

5

to the amount of that hypothetical recovery.

for $495,000 , didn't they?

MR. KOTLER:

QUESTION:

In attorneys' fees .
That was their request if the

calculations in the record are correct.

They asked

seem to understand your question.

That would have been

Well, Lopez, $316,000 and some odd

miscellaneous, an additional $7,000.

$495,000 that they requested.

them approximately in half, didn't they?

MR. KOTLER:
QUESTION:

2

Multiplier of two, yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Kotler, can I ask you a question,

3

because I am a little confused in view of your discussion

4

with Justice Blackmun.

5

You are making two different arguments as I

s

understand.

One, you are saying there was a lot of time

7

spent in litigating people who were innocent and I gather

e

in effect they were compensated for time that they shouldn't

9

be paid for.

10

MR. KOTLER:

11

QUESTION:

12

That is correct.
And that would be true however big

the verdict was, is that not right?

13

MR. KOTLER:

14

QUESTION:

That is correct.
That is one argument.

Your second

15

argument, as I understand it, is that even if all the

16

time is properly computed, there is -- are you arguing

17

as a matter of law you may never

18

be paid more than the client?
MR. KOTLER:

19

No.

the lawyer may never

What I am saying is we have

20

a situation now -- We use the lodestar approach to fee

21

calculation.

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

23

MR. KOTLER:

Basically that is where the court

24

begins.

After the lodestar is calculated, the court may

25

then either raise or lower the fee award consistent with
11
ALOUSOH R!PORTIHG COMPANY, IHC.
20 f ST,. H.W .. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001

(202) 621·9300

the dictates of Hensley and Blum and other cases.
2

What I am arguing for, instead of starting with

3

the lodestar in private tort action -- and I would

4

characterize this a private tort action

5

start with the similar market-based fee and then raise

6

or lower from that.

7

QUESTION:

we ought to

Well, would you ask them to put on

8

evidence in effect that if they had to go out and raise

9

money -- every now and then you read in the paper about

10

someone who is raising money to finance an important piece

II

of litigation -- he should get paid what a competent counsel

12

would charge if a war chest were created for him or what

13

is it?

14

MR. KOTLER:

No, Justice Stevens, I would not.

15

What I would ask is that evidence be put on as to what

16

the fee arrangements were in California, or Los Angeles

17

more narrowly, for similar tort actions.

18

arrangements were common in that locality.

19

QUESTION:

What kind of

That would always mean the fee would

20

have to be less than the recovery because contingent fees

21

are always paid out of the recovery then.

22

23
24

25

MR. KOTLER:

Would be less than the recovery,

but assuming an award of a million dollars -QUESTION:

But, if that is the test

Isn't

it true in California also that contingency fees are general l

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

(lOlJ 628·9300

a percentage of the recovery?
2

MR. KOTLER:

If your question is would it always

3

be less than the total recovery in a case, a private case

4

winding up in money damages only, the answer is yes.

5

QUESTION:

So, what would you do with a case

6

like Carey against Piphus where the court says there is

7

a one dollar nominal damage or just say there are not

8

fees in those cases.

9

MR. KOTLER :

No, because I think it is clear

10

under the Carey case and under Hensley and under Blum

11

the court, trial court still retains a certain amount

12

of discretion to
QUESTION:

13
14

15

Well, why not in a case like this

then?
MR. KOTLER:

I think the trial court had discretion

16

but I think the discretion must be exercised consistent

17

with the factors and guidelines that this Court said had

18

to be used in the Hensley case.

19

All I am arguing for i s that as a starting point

20

we start at a different place than we are now.

21

use the lodestar as a starting point in private action

22

tort suits .

23

QUESTION:

We don't

Well, you are really telling me two

24

different things.

25

start that way you end up on a contingent fee approach

I thought you first said that if you

13
ALDERSON AIPORTIHG COMPANY. IHC.
20 F ST. H.W •• WASHIHGTOH, D.C. 20001

12021 621-9300

which requires the fee to be less than the award.
2

Now you are saying all you do is start there

3

and then if that doesn't seem fair the district judge

4

can then approach it from a lodestar point of view.

5

MR. KOTLER:

Okay .

I didn't mean to imply that

6

the contingency basis , just like the lodestar basis, is

7

absolute.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, if it is not absolute, why

isn't it fair to infer in th is case -- the district judge

10

looked at it and said, well, in view of the time spent

11

the lawyers have to get more than $30,000 and the only

12

way we can figure out how to do it is to move on to a

13

lodestar.

14

MR. KOTLER:

That brings me to my second point.

15

My second point is that you still have to look at the

16

results obtained by the litigation and if you look at

17

the results obtained, it wouldn't be possible to raise

18

this case from $11,000, which is a one-third contingency,

19

to a quarter of a million.

20

2I

QUESTION:

I am arguing for both things.

What do you do with a nominal damage

case then if that is the result, a dollar?

22

MR. KOTLER:

Well, fortunately, under my theory,

23

you would start with thirty-three cents and then you could

24

raise it.

25

QUESTION:

To may 10 or 15 or something like

14
ALDIRSOH RIPORTIHG COMPAHY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W•• WASHINGTOH. D.C. 20001

1202) 628·9300

that.
MR. KOTLER:

2

No, not at all, not at all.

If

3

the value of the case -- if the thing the case resulted

4

in achieves some societal benefit, obviously it could

5

be raised.

6

But, Congress, when it passed 1988, I don't

1

think was looking to provide access for the marginal or

8

less than good case.

9

cases.

It was providing access for meritorious

And, a case that has no value might not be a

10

meritorious case.

11

to these cases and they are the j urors and in this case

12

the jurors said the value of this case was $33,000.

13

other cases, the value might be less, but certainly the

14

trial judge would retain some discretion to raise a fee

15

if the value of the case in the trial judge's mind was

16

in excess of that set by the jury.

17

We have triers of fact who give value

In

Briefly, on the facts, a petition for certiorari

18

was filed in this case initially and was granted by this

19

Court which vacated the first award of attorneys' fees

20

herein and remanded the matter back to the district court

21

to be considered in light of this Court's then recent

n

decision of Hensley versus Eckerhart.

23

Thereafter, at spreading of the mandate from

24

the Ninth Circuit, the trial judge announced that it

25

was going to reinstate its previous award to the penny
15
AlDIRSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST.. N.W ., WASHINGTON, DC. 20001

(202) 628·9300

and subsequently did exactly that.
2

Petitioners again appealed and once again the

3

Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court and then this Court

4

granted cert last October.

5

I believe the legislative history of Section 1988

6

makes two things clear.

7

the legilsation was to provide civil rights plaintiffs

8

with effective access to the judicial process.

9

First, Congress' purpose in passing

Secondly, in so doing, Congress' intend as to

10

any fees to be awarded thereunder were to be adequate

11

to attract competent counsel but not so large as to result

12

in windfalls to the attorneys involved.

13

such fees reasonable and left it up to the trial courts

14

to decide what a reasonable fee would be in each individual

15

case.

16

Congress thought

Since the passage of Section 1988, however,

17

this Court and other lower appellate courts have provided

18

numerous guidelines to be followed by trial courts to

19

either calculation of such fees.

20

Heretofore, it appears that this process required

21

the district court to make two distinct calculations.

n

First, the district court had to determine the lodestar

23

figure, that is the number of hours reasonably expended

24

on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.

25

Secondly, the district courts had to examine
16
Al.DEASOH AEPOATIHG COMPAHY. IHC.
20 F ST., H.W •• WASHIHGTOH, DC, 20001

1202) 628-9300

the relationship between the claims on which counsels'
2

efforts were expended in light of the ultimate relief

3

which was obtained by those efforts.
In that regard, this Court has stated in Hensley

4

5

that where a plaintiff achieved only limited success, the

6

district court should award such fees as are reasonable

7

in relation to the results obtained by the litigation.

8
9

However, the fee award here, nearly a quarter
of a million dollars, following judgments aggregating

10

$33,350 in a tort suit brought solely for the monetary

"

benefit of the eight respondents, is not one which under

12

any stretch of the imagination could be called reasonable.
QUESTION:

13

Well, Mr. Kotler, I thought a moment

14

ago you said that there had been prayers for injunctive

15

relief, at least at the beginning of the suit.

16

MR. KOTLER:

That is correct.

The claims for

17

injunctive relief were dropped prior to trial.

is

were claims in addition to declaratory relief and those

19

were also dropped.
QUESTION:

20

There

Well, suppose some injunctive relief

21

were granted or some declaratory relief as well as damages,

22

how would you then suggest the court approach the fee

23

problem?

24
25

MR. KOTLER:
the injunctive relief.

It would depend on the nature of
If the injunctive relief went

precedential value it sets may have value above and beyond

the individual plaintiffs?

Yes, I think it

10

is arguable.

Do I think that is necessarily the case?

11

I would say to that no more than any plaintiff's victory

12

in any type of litigation has value to deter conduct by

13

defendant.

14

litigation it would be.

It doesn't make any difference what kind of

15

I think to the extent that this had a public

16

benefit, it would be incumbent upon the fee petitioner

17

to prove that such benefit existed, since, after all,

18

it is the fee petitioner who is asking for fees.

I think it is arguable.

Whether it is provable

did, were the time records of the respondents .

Certainly it couldn't

The time

10

records didn't separate time spent as among any of the

11

defendants or on any of the theories.

12

So, I think to that extent it was impossible to

13

separate out.

I also think though that this Court in

14

Hensley and other cases, Webb versus Board of Education, has

15

said that the District Court must exercise its discretion

16

based on time records, at least up to a certain level,

It is clear what they charged here.

MR. KOTLER:

QUESTION:

MR. KOTLER:

Yes, sir.
Or tried to charge, $125 an hour?
That is correct.

The only thing

13

in the record at all with respect to an hourly rate, there

14

was a declaration by another attorney in Los Angeles,

whose declaration never said that he did civil rights

reasonable rate, but there was nothing more than that.

Did you introduce evidence to the

filed an affidavit on their behalf, saying that that is

13

not sufficient.

17

QUESTION:

But, you had no evidence as to the

MR. KOTLER :

There was no evidence one way or

the other as to the prevailing rate in the community.

18

We would argue that a disproportionate fee such

19

as here is no less unreasonable simply because the losing

20

party is the one that has to foot the bill.

21

arriving at the lodestar figure in this case, the District

22

Court failed to meet its duty both under Blum and under

23

Hensley to adjust the lodestar figure to fit the degree

24

of success achieved to insure that the fee herein was

25

proper, that it was reasonable.

Yet after

AlOIRSON AIPORTING COMPANY, INC.

We would argue that where the lodestar fee
2

as here exceeds or equals the damages recovered by a

3

plaintiff in a case resulting solely in that form of relief

4

that the lodestar produces an unreasonable fee and should

5

be reduced.

6

On the other hand, the free market test of con-

7

tingency fee arrangements in general use in a given community

8

not only provide a more accurate reflection of the true

9

value of a fee petitioner's service in a private tort

10

action, which this was, but also produces a fee more con-

11

sistent with the goals of Congress when it enacted Section

12

1988 , again , a fee that is reasonable .

13

For these reasons , petitioners suggest the

impl ementation of new guidelines to be f o l lowed by district

15

courts awarding fees under Section 1988, guidelines , which

16

if adopted, would preclude the kind of result which has

17

occurred herein.

18

First, we would ask that the District Court

19

ascertain whether or not a case was a public case or a

private case.

21

would be one which would demonstrably result in public

benefit; that is a provable benefit to persons in addition

to the individual plaintiffs.

Well, counsel, don't you start off

2

in trouble where the defendants are police officers?

3

Doesn't that automatically make it public?
MR. KOTLER:

I am focusing on the relief, Your

QUESTION:

MR. KOTLER:

9
10

Would it be the same?
I don't think so, in this case,

there were no policies or practices changed.
If it is found that the matter is a private

11

litigation, attorney fees would be awarded based on the

12

prevailing fee schedule for tort actions, probably not

13

necessarily on a contingency basis.

14

Of course, the trial court would always retain

15

its discretion to adjust this amount up or down to account

for the plaintiff's degree of success.

18

show what they customarily charge, what their charges

19

were in other cases, these particular lawyers?

MR. KOTLER:

Nothing.

There wasn't one word.

However, if the District Court determined that

22

the case is one which has provable benefits, provable

resulted in vindication of civil rights of a representative

MR. LOPEZ :

Mr. Lopez?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

Let me remind you of the formal question before

the Court raised by this case, whether or not a fee award

20

The search for an answer to this question begins

Social value.

There is a debate

Now , if you push the question a little, you

should ask me what distinction am I drawing?

4

therefore, is there between the notion of there is by

5

law social value but there is, nonetheless, important

6

discretion to be exercised by the District Court as announced

1

by Congress and as pursued by this Court in Hensley and

8

Webb .

9

What distinction

The distinction is that Congress and this Court

10

invited this attention said we don't want courts, district

11

courts or the Supreme Court, to muck around with the

12

incredibly difficult finding of whether or not one case,

13

one right, one remedy, equals more social value than another.

14

What is important in civil right s c ases, as

15

it has been important in antitrust cases, in fair trade

16

cases and the like, is that Congress makes the decision

17

as a matter of national policy that some classes of cases

18

deserve national attention through private litigation.

19

These cases are important enough to reverse the typical

20

presumption that each side must pay its own way, but only

21

if you prevaii.

What happens when there is something less

If the claims cannot be said to be discreet,

which Justice Powell's opinion said would likely be the

case in most civil rights cases, if they follow from one

sensible arguments

to be made by the losing party which says some of the

In order to be successful with that, you would have to

demonstrate that something in the record, something in

While the argument might obviously be sensible

17

in light of the fact that social value wasn't her job

19

through the jury's judgment justified the hours expended.

20

If I might elaborate in a slightly different

21

way, while I think that the answer to the question put

22

before this Court, the reason this Court is concerned

23

about the case, is found within the pages of the legislation

24

and its history.

happened in this case?

what hours were expended and Justice Powell's questions

4

begin to link up the kinds of things I am concerned about.

QUESTION:

Is there something that justifies

MR. LOPEZ:

Now, for

Immodesty aside, Your Honor, Congress

11

recognized and cited Johnson as the case which said that

12

while the years out matter, if someone is good enough

13

to gain the kind of wage that is typically paid to more

14

experienced people, that is what they are to be paid.

15

QUESTION:

Now let's come back to my question.

16

Is $125 an hour the prevailing rate which is what the

11

district judge purported to use for a one- and two-year

18

law graduate?

But, the more important thing to understand
2

is that is a Johnson factor elaborated by this Court in

3

Hensley and it doesn't end on what is the prevailing rate

4

in light of the number of years of experience, but in

5

light of the expertise of counsel.

6

QUESTION:

7

thing by the result they got?

8
9

Well, is the expertise measured some-

MR. LOPEZ:

Is that taken into account?

It is certainly one of the 12 factors

that is relevant to the expertise, to be sure, which is

10

why I would like to return to the question of what exactly

11

was the product of these many hours of litigation?

12

For all that was said about what happened before

13

the District Court, conspicuously absent are the findings

14

of the District Court, a peculiar omission, you might

15

understand , in light of the challenge that one should

16

have to make to them.

17

In addition to what Justice Powell underscored,

18

let me just briefly i terate some of those findings relevant

19

to your consideration today.

20

The District Court found that both the City

21

of Riverside and indivi dual officers, including two of

22

the only three supervising officers involved, participated

23

in lawless, unconstitutional conduct.

24

The District Court also found that this lawless,

25

unconstitutional product was not simply the product of

20 F ST.. H.W., WASHIHGTOH, D.C. 20001

(202) 62&·9300

individual acts, but also the product of racial animus,
2

the product of hostility toward the Chicano community

3

in the City of Riverside.

4

Finally and importantly, the same District Court

5

said that this racially motivated police discrimination,

6

this lawless and unconstitutional conduct, had to be

7

stopped, and I now quote the District Court:

8

short of a lawsuit like this could have done this."

9
10

11

"And nothing

Now, obviously, these findings by the District
Court mirror what the jury found.

The jury found after

all that the City of Riverside's customs or'policies them-

12

13

found that not only did the individual police officers

QUESTION:

24

concern that at least lurks on my part is in my 16 years

2

a reasonable fee, the client fully able to pay, and if

3

you get a judgment for $35,000 where perhaps you had expected

4

a judgment for half a million dollars, you simply cannot

5

bill that client a quarter of a million dollars.

6

MR. LOPEZ:

I think that is often the case in

7

litigation outside the boundaries of fee-shifting statutes

8

and 1988 in particular.

9

there is an empirical matter.

Although I might add that I think
There is some fairly strong

10

suggestion that there are some cases where the basis for

11

the amount charged is not the damage

12

the hours expended.

13

QUESTION:

but rather

There may be, but are you suggesting

14

then that 1988 was simply -- when it used the term "reasonable

15

fee " was intending to transmute what the normal experience

16

in private practice was?
MR. LOPEZ:

17

Absolutely, Your Honor .

When 1988

18

was enacted, it had two forms of fee understandings in

19

mind.

20

of the people who file civil rights claims typically can't

21

pay the hourly rate of attorneys.

22

I suspect, is your understanding in private practice about

23

what the relationship is between what is recovered and

24

what may be fairly charged.

25

One was an hourly rate and it concluded that most

Somewhere in there,

The other type was the contingency fee record;
38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST.. N.W .. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001

(202) 628·9300

that is the typical understanding which says, listen,
2

for these kinds of cases isn't it true that you shall

3

get a recovery that provides you for taking out attorney

4

fees.

5

this simply wasn't working in civil rights claims, that

6

as a matter of empirical understanding too many of these

7

claims giving the damage rules that don't permit you to

8

easily evaluate what a constitutional right is worth,

9

apart from physical injuries, lead predictably to such

It also specifically found, Congress that is, that

10

little money that any sensible P.I. type or anybody else

II

who is not otherwise funded or was not incredibly heroic

12

in time they are willing to give away was simply not taking

13

the case.

14

The result of those definings was to say that

15

much like in many other statutes, it is not simply civil

16

rights statutes, we are going to find that the typical

17

understanding of Justice Rehnquist's or anybody else's

18

practice is not what operates in these cases.

19

What operates in these cases is we shall make

20

the plaintiff's attorney suffer the difficulty of deciding

21

whether or not a case is worth it, because if it is not

22

going to win, you can put in four and a half years of

23

stuff and nothing shall happen, but if it wins, if it prevails,

24

the single predicate and the critical one, then what shall

25

happen is you are entitled presumptively to a reasonable
39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628·9300

fee.
2

QUESTION:

Do you think, Mr. Lopez, that under-

3

standing is the same in the authorization for fee shifting,

4

the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Antitrust Act, earlier

5

fee shifting statutes?
MR. LOPEZ:

6

Actually it differs enormously little

7

which is what my study of all the statutes suggests; that

8

is the fee shifting statutes have actually gone back to

9

something like a hundred years ago.

10

These are not novel

things, though they typically weren't very common.

11

What happened quickly over time, when people

12

began to discover that as a result of sometimes not terribly

13

careful and sometime very careful empirical study the

14

national investment in particular kinds of rights wasn't

15

being actualized because attorneys simply weren't taking

16

case.
So, what they decided typically was to throw out

17

18

normal understandings which weren't working and to conclude

19

that given that you had to prevail that people should

20

otherwise be awarded fees that are reasonable.

21

Your next question I suppose should be that

22

you don't mean to ask that we simply invite the District

23

Court discretionless to take a look at these things and

24

having concluded that you prevailed give you all that

25

you have.

I think not and clearly Congress never intended
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., H.W .. WASHIHGTOH, D.C. 20001

(202) 621·9300

that, these courts' three opinion on this question have
2

never said so, nor did we act so presumptuously as to

3

push that either at the District Court or the Court of

4

Appeals.

5

We carefully elaborated precisely what we thought

6

we were entitled to specifically as this Court directed

1

us in light of Hensley and it was exactly that that took

8

into account both the size of the monetary damage, the

9

total award, along with the other 11 features that Johnson

10
11

made relevant.
So, while I

think that Congress said you

12

have to throw out normal understanding, not only hourly

13

rates, but most importantly the equivalent of what the

14

Solicitor General proposed and what petitioners now endorse,

15

namely, this effort to relegislate what Congress threw

16

away as an appropriate interpretation of 1988, because

17

those aren't the way that these kinds of cases shall be

18

vindicated in the private market.

19

There is one final glimmer of something that

20

is ugly about our performance here, perhaps other civil

21

rights attorneys' performance, that I think should be

22

made slightly more explicit.

23

and this is probably the weaker of the two notions

24

some sense that plaintiffs, either in this case or in

25

other cases, highly romaticized what has happened to them,

That is there is either

41
ALOERSOH RfPORTIHG COMPAHY, IMC.

20 f ST., M.W .. WASHIHGTOH, O.C. 20001

C202) 628-9300

\

that they put a higher dollar figure than actual damage
2

rules permit and, therefore, when confronted with sensible

3

offers, somehow refused them.
Coupled with that is the idea of a lawyer, either

4

5

who sees the case as an easy winner or for some economically

6

irrational reason given empirical doubt about this case,

7

nonetheless figures this is where I shall gouge.

8

Both those concerns, it seems to me, follows

9

from an understanding which says either this case, Mr.

10

Lopez, or these cases in the aggregate surely concern

11

us because, while you may be right that Congress said

12

this is okay, what is happening is the taxpayers in general

13

are made to foot the bill that is excessive.
The focus is then, you, Mr. Lopez, somehow justify

14

15

what is going on here.

16

that?

17

too much time and charge too high a rate, etc .

18
19
20

Aren't you the party that decided

This is the way it had to be litigated, you put

While I think the concern is immensely justified,
I think the focus is badly skewed.
The party that had most to do with this case

21

going on and on was not the plaintiffs but the defendants.

22

The defendants were the ones after all, and I speak now

23

of both the City of Riverside and the individual defendants,

24

who decided that after the filing of the administrative

25

complaint, before a federal lawsuit was ever in mind,
42
ALDIRSOt< REPORTING COMPAt<Y. INC.
10 F ST.• t<,W ,. WASHINGTOt<, D.C. 10001

(lOl) 628·9300

never to respond by saying that in light of what was done,
2

ultimately unconstitutional and lawless, we shall both

3

apologize and offer you something like what was actually

4

the damages here.

5

The defendants were the ones that, after refusing

6

to make that offer after the administrative complaints

7

were filed, then pursued without probable cause of finding

8

of the District Court the longest misdemeanor trial in

9

the City of Riverside simply to avoid having the lack

10

of probable cause finding against them.

11

The defendants were the one who, after the filing

12

of the suit and for some four a half years, as a matter

13

of the finding of the District Court, never made a sensible

14

offer.

15

The defendants were the ones, and perhaps this

16

is most critical, most critical in light of Justice Stevens'

11

opinion in Marek v. Chesney and the operation of Rule

18

68, the defendants were the ones who decided never to

19

make an offer of judgment to both the plaintiffs and the

20

plaintiffs' attorneys who they now describe as gouging,

21

an offer of j udgment that would have foreclosed the capacity

22

to gain costs if, in fact, the jury's verdict were, indeed,

23

less than what the offer was, costs in light of Marek,

24

including attorneys' fees.

25

When that is the behavior of defendants, then
43
AlD!RSOH R!PORTIHG COMPANY, IHC.
20 F ST•• H.W., W ASHIHGTOH, O.C. 20001

(202) 628·9300

you have little doubt about why it took four and a half
2

years to try and get information tnat was solely in the

3

hands of the defendant and why you went to trial on a

4

case where we knew too, in light of Carey v. Piphus and

5

the actual damage rule, that it was inunensely likely that

6

the damage award would be small.

7

What was important nonetheless was that these

8

clients were treated disrespectfully, not as a highly

9

romaticized matter, but as a kind of insistently practical

10

matter because all they were asking was not to be treated,

11

because they were Chicanos in a place where they lived

12

and worked, in an incredibly and institutionally discrimina-

13

tory fashion so that the judgment, a monetary judgment

14

to be sure, was thought to subsume the important social

15

value and the deterrent value that at least thus far in

16

this argument has been presumed solely to follow from

17

either declaratory relief or an injunction.

18

And, if there is concern about what the taxpayers

19

have to pay here, taxpayers who include my clients, I

20

will add, then the real scrutiny ought to be of defendants

21

and defendants' behavior in these kinds of cases, particularly

22

when they have all the tools to put an end to it.

23

If they fa il to take advantage of it, it hardly

24

strikes me as an appropriate argument or at least one

you ought not make without significant embarrassment to

In our brief we clarify what was

actually an incorrect statement, both by petitioners'

9

counsel today and in the in-chambers opinion, that we

10

did not drop the request for injunction before trial.

11

Rather, we waited until the evidence came in and decided

12

on our own that we got what we wanted in the judgment

13

against both the city for customs and policies that violated

14

constitutional rights and against individuals that included

15

punitives.

16

We presupposed, which is precisely what this

17

18

cases and many other kinds of cases, that damage awards

19

have social value and were deterrents.

7

then your later opinion in Lyons.

QUESTION:

9

MR. LOPEZ:

We did.

liability, that they had a policy that lead to this

12

unconstitutional conduct.

ALOIRSOM RIPOUJNG COMPANY, INC.

our attention, perhaps thinking as Justice White does,
2

to whether or not we wanted it, because it was her dispositio ,

3

again made explicit on the record, that she was inclined

4

to give us an injunction and it was at that point that

5

I said on the record that the only kind of injunction

6

I thought was appropriate was the tautological one, please

7

ask the city and the individual defendants to obey the

8

Constitution.

9

The typical presumption is local governments

10

as much as federal government care enough about the Constitu-

11

tion to obey it and it was on that understanding in light

12

of the case law that I decided that the judgment we got

13

did what we wanted and why invite some mess that actually

14

accomplished nothing more than what we wanted.
