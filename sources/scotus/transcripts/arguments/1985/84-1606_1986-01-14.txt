manner in which the trial justice conducted the hearing

permissible,

of whether Flynn in this case was denied a fair trial.

6

First I will address the

and then I will address the broader question

I would briefly like to review some of the

7

important facts.

8

occurred in the summer of 1975 in Providence, Rhode

9

Island.

This was a four month long trial that

The case involved a major robbery, perhaps one

10

of the most celebrated trials ever in Rhode Island

11

history, the robbery of the Bonded Yault warehouse in

12

Providence, Rhode Island.

13

charges, there were kidnapping charges and weapons

14

charges against, lodged against the defendants.

15

In addition to armed robbery

There were actually ej.ght co-defendants in this

16

case.

17

and the others because they were at large at the time of

Two of them, however, were not tried with Flynn

a

18

the trial.

19

Five other defendants were tried with Flynn, as I pointed

20

out earlier, so six defendants were tried together.

21

Three were convicted and three were acquitted at this

22

trial.

23

without bail and therefore were, under Rhode Island law,

24

in the custody of the Rhode Island State Marshal

25

Those ware defendants Nacaskill and Lanou.

All of the defendants at this trial were held

QUESTIONS

Were they held with — when you use

the term were held without bail, do you mean they were

2

unable to raise money bail or that the trial court would

3

not allow them to be free even if they had raised money

4

bail?

5

KTR • DICKINSON*

It was that they,

they were —

6

the trial court would not allow them to be free, and

7

perhaps this is — this may be an esoteric point of Rhode

8

Island law.

9

determined prior to trial not to be entitled to bail.

However, these defendants were specifically
So

1C

it wasn’t a situation where they were indigent defendants

11

who couldn’t afford to make bail, as perhaps this Court

12

referral to in the Estelle v. Williams case where you

13

might have an equal protection concern where the —

14

because the only reason the defendants is -- defendant is

15

in custody —

16

QUESTION*

17

MR. DICKINSON*

18

correct. Your Honor,

Well, bail was denied,

that’s all.

Bail was denied, that's

prior to trial.

19

QUESTION*

20

MR. DICKINSON*

Did each have his own counsel?
My recollection is that Flynn

21

and another defendant shared counsel.

I’m not sure which

22

other defendant that was. Your Honor.

I believe it was

23

one of the defendants who was acquitted.

24
25

QUESTION*

So it would suggest that there were

at least four defense counsel?

MR. DICKINSONt

defense counsel, that’s true, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION*

4

HR. DICKINSON*

5

Oh, there were at least four

For the trial.
And there ware also two

prosecutors, I believe, in the courtroom at all times.

6

Two participants in the robbery who were never

7

charged as defendants, Messrs. Dussault and Danese, also

8

participated in the trial by testifying against Flynn and

9

his co-defendants.

They had turned state’s evidence and

10

were within the protection of Rhode Island authorities,

11

so that as this triaL began, it became clear that this

12

was an unusual circumstances — unusual circumstance,

13

first of all, because of the large number of defendants.

14

It became clear to the individuals charged with

15

maintaining custody of these defendants that with the

16

forca of marshals that they had at thair disposal, they

17

could not maintain the proper ratio of security personnel

18

to defendants in the courtroom.

19

The state marshals, if you will, were

20

numerically incapable of serving at this trial.

21

were, at the time of this trial, there were eleven

22

marshals in Rhode Island, eleven available in Providence

23

County, I should say,

24

the Marshals Service, Mr. Melucci, testified a*- a

25

pretrial hearing, and his testimony was that at all times

to service this trial.

’’’here

The head of

1

during the course of a criminal trial, when defendants

2

who are being held without bail are on trial, at all

3

times the marshals attempt to maintain a ratio of two

4

security personnel to one defendant.

5

Now, it would appear —

6

QUESTIONS

Mr. Dickinson, there was a state

7

appellate court review of the trial court’s rulings, in

8

effect, wasn’t there?

9
10

NR, DICKINSON*

Honor, that there were two reviews.

11
12

I suppose you might say, Your

QUESTION*

Was there — yes, well, there was.

You acknowledge that.

13

NR. DICKINSON*

14

QUESTION*

That’s true, that’s true.

Now, did the state appellate court

15

ever think that the trial judge had considered that there

16

was anything about these defendants or this trial that

17

required extra security?

18

NR. DICKINSON*

I would submit, Your Honor,

19

that there’s nothing — the state appellate court did

20

not, did not cite anything specifically referenced to

21

these defendants with regard to,

22

security.

23

QUESTION*

if you will, heightened

It seemed to focus on the manpower

24

shortages and the obligations of the collective

25

bargaining agreement.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

HR. DICKINSON*

Well, it certainly focused on

2

those aspects, Your Honor, and perhaps the reason for

3

that is that

4

force was not enhanced security at all but was to provide

5

normal security, and the only way that normal security

6

could be provided was to enhance it with some outside

7

service.

8
9

what the — the purpose of the security

QUESTION*

Now, is that clear in the record,

that if there had been enough nonuniformed people

10

available, would they have been in the courtroom and

11

seated in roughly the same place?

12

BR. DICKINSON*

Hell, I don’t think the record

13

specificallyi speaks to nonuniformed personnel for the

14

reason that the issue that was presented to the trial

15

judge was state troopers.

16

QUESTION*

17

MR. DICKINSON*

18

I know, I know.
^s opposed to state marshals,

and of course, state marshals are uniformed.

19

QUESTION*

I know, but you just said,

you just

said that this wasn’t enhanced security, this was just

normal security.

and of itself, I would suggest, is not unusual at all

3

4

QUESTION*

Well, are you asking us to believe

that in this particular trial there always would have

6

been security people seated in the courtroom.

7

MR. DICKINSON*

8

QUESTION*

9

MR. DICKINSON;

10

That is correct. Your Honor.

In a case like this.
In any case, Your Honor, there

would be a certain —

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. DICKINSON*

Would there have bean four or -There would have — the

13

security forces would have maintained, attempted to

14

maintain a two to one ratio, so in a case where you had

15

one defendant, there would be two.

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. DICKINSON;

Was that the general rule?
The general goal. Your Honor,

18

was a two to one ratio.

19

that what was maintained throughout this case was a

20

better than one to one ratio, and that that was a -- the

21

minimal was above one to Die, and going to one to one --

QUESTION;

It was appear — it would appear

23

a dozen marshals, uniformed differently, I gather, from

the state troopers, would they also have been armed?

QUESTION;

Mr. Dickinson, do you take the

21

position that the presence of armed security guards in

22

the courtroom, no matter how many there might have been,

23

simply doesn't impair or burden the presumption of

24

innocence, or do you take the position the*-

25

there was a

were in fact taken?

2

I'm not clear what your position is.,

3

SR. DICKINSONs

if ell, I think our position.

4

Your Honor, is in some ways both.

5

contend that in this case there was unquestionably a need

6

for the presence of a security force to maintain custody

of the defendants.

custody —

First of all,

QUESTION*

finding by the trial court or the state appellat e court.
SR. DICKINSON*

Well, I would suggest,

Your

12

Honor, that the trial judge specifically found t hat it

13

was — that the ronmitted squad itself, the squa d of

14

state marshals, was inadequate and that tne only

15

supplement that was available to the committing squad was

16

a force of stat troopers, and that to that exten t, from

17

that logical conclusion, these state troopers we re

'i

19

necessary in the courtroom to maintain custody QUESTI0N&

20

was a finding that there was a need for special

there was a large number of defendants, six, and that all

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

simply inadequate to both operate at this trial and

2

permit the system of justice in Rhode Island to go on —

3

QUESTION;

4

Why were they armed?

5

SR. DICKINSON;

Wall, what was the nead for arms?

The trial judge didn’t make a

6

specific finding as to the need for arms, and it was

7

never really specifically addressed that there was a need

8

for the troopers to be armed in this courtroom.

9
10

QUESTION;

Take,

take this hypothetical.

Juror A, who has been to three trials and in

11

every trial the people there with the defendants were

12

unarmed, and then he’s at this one where they are armed,

13

could he draw a conclusion from that?

14

MR. DICKINSON;

I suppose that a hypothetical

15

juror might draw such

16

Justice Giannini ii this case conducted an extensive voir

17

dire of the jurors who were available for being empaneled

18

in this trial.

19

20

&

conclusion, and to that end,

Jid he ask them would they be

influenced by a gun?

MR. DICKINSON;

was never transcribed. Your Honor.

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. DICKINSON;

25

During — the voir dire itself

Well, I ~
However, it’s ~lear from

Justice Giannini’s summarization of what occurred at the

1

voir dire that none of the jurors who were seated in the

2

jury box at the trial drew any kind of inference at all

3

from the presence of armed troopers.

4

QUESTION*

They acquitted three of the — they

5

acquitted three of the defendants, so they,

6

they must have had a selective feeling if there was any

7

feeling at all.

8
9

HR. DICKENSON*

apparently

Bell, in fact, Your Honor,

that's why I don't think it's necessary for us today to

10

focus too much on the hypothetical juror because we have

11

the voir dire in this case i which the jurors clearly

12

expressed no inference at all from the presence of armed

13

troopers, and we have what this jury actually did in the

14

end, which was arguit three of

15

QUESTION*

the defendants.

About how many reasons can you

16

conceive that a juror would arguit one man and hold

17

another man guilty,

18

would you —

19

20

about how many different reasons

HR. DICKINSON!

Well, Your Honor,

I think there

are infinite possibilities, of course —

21

QUESTION!

22

MR. DICKINSON*

Close to a million, wouldn't it be?
Of course, and as Justice

23

Giannini concluded in the motion for a new trial aspect

24

of this case, you can never really draw any inferences

25

from what the jury does in many cases because the burden

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is so great that one

2

shifting set of circumstances related to one defendant

3

may fall below that burden,

4

that is what happened with the jurors.

5

that when they focused upon the three defendants that

3

they acquitted in their deliberations, they certainly

7

weren’t influenced by the presence of the troopers.

8

acquitted those defendants.

9

and in this case, apparently
But the point is

They

So —

10

QUESTION;

11

NR. DICKINSON*

12

QUESTION;

Nr. Dickinson.
Yes, Your Honor.

I want to find out,

if I can, if it

12

is in the record, how the system of furnishing security

14

at Rhode Island trials works.

15

Is it ordinarily the judge who decides what

16

sort of security particular defendants should be

17

furnished, or is it the marshals service?

18

NR. DICKINSON*

I would say

chat the ordinary

19

practice, Your Honor, is that the marshals — if a

20

defendant is not on bail — I'm sorry, if a defendant is

21

on bail, we can dismiss that category of cases*

22

marshals have nothing to do with that defendant because

23

he is not in custody;

24

maintaining his custody.

that the focus of the state trial judge should have been

which the First Circuit suggested from the American Ear

clear from the record of this trial.

Another factor that

the American Bar Association standirs suggest is that

But the reason why we asked for a remand, Your
Honor, is that as we read the habeas jurisprudence of

Absolutely without the

QUESTIONi

MR. DICKINSON*

Yes, yes, all right.
Were this Court to conclude

7

that the First Circuit had some points with regard to the

8

manner in which the trial judge had conducted the

9

pretrial hearing, it is certainly Flynn’s burden a a

10

habeas petitioner to put before the federal court facts

11

that will support his claim for a new trial, and it is

12

our view that he failed to do that by failing to put in

13

any evidence in the lower court.

14

But base! upon all these factors, it’s the

15

state’s position that Justice Giannini reasonably

16

concluded in

17

were necessary to maintain proper order and custody of

18

the defendants, and that even if he was wrong in that,

19

even if this court ware to conclude ha w^s wrong, that

20

the defendant was not denied his constitutional right to

21

a fair trial, there was strong evidence against this

22

defendant, strong evidence that the jury properly gave

23

credence to the presumption of innocence because it

24

acquitted three co-dafendants, and strong evidence and a

25

factual finding by Justice Giannini that the jurors had

the superior court level that the troopers

demonstrates, it could be that they acquitted the three

6

who were furthest from the troopers, and convicted the

three who were closest.

8

QUESTION;

For all the record

Do you considar the past criminal

9

record of Flynn as being relevant at all to the opinion

of the judge that security was needed in the courtroom?

11

KR. KANNAR*

No, for two reasons.

With regard

it's very

clear that under RnoJe Island law at the time this case

22-

the case of Lemme v. Langlois in which the Rhode Island
