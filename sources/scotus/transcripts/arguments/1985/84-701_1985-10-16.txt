Riverside appealed, but in the meantime the

3

regulations defining wetlands had been changed, and so

the United States asked that the case be remanded to the

5

District Court to consider the effect of the new

regulations on the facts of this case, and cn remand,

7

Judge Gilmore, who by this time the case had been

8

reassigned to, applied the facts as found by Judge

9

Kennedy in her lengthy trial to the new regulations, and

10

found again that Riverside’s property was a wetland

11

within the Corps* jurisdiction, and again entered a

12

permanent injunction prohibiting Riverside from filling

13

without a permit.

14

On Riverside’s second appeal,

the Sixth

15

Circuit reversed.

16

based its decision on its interpretation of the Corps'

17

revised regulations.

MS. OBEPLYi

We claimed that even before the

map had been found, and we are happy to win it that way

9

or — but it seemed to me important once the exhibits

10

had been located for this Court to see what we were

11

actually talking about in this case, and to the Court of

12

Appeals' credit, they asked to see the exhibits at the

13

oral argument in the Sixth Circuit, and they were told

14

they had been lost, and it wasn't until

15

had either petitioned for cert or cert had been granted

16

that someone in the District Court clerk's office found

17

the exhibits, and that is all quite unfortunate, but it

18

doesn't change the fact that in cur view, either using

19

these maps or using the theory that is basically set

20

forth in our petition and in our opening brief, this is

21

a wetland, and that the Court of Appeals legal analysis

22

was wrone.

23

Well, using your old theory,

24

without the overlay of the new map and facts, the Corps

Okay.

Must there be seme effect on

MS. OBERLY;

I think you could argue the case,

18

and I could answer the question no and still be correct,

19

but in this case we can demonstrate a connection between

20

the wetland and these navigable waters, and that is all

21

that this Court would have to decide.

22

QUESTION;

Well, disregarding this case, on

23

the pure theory, must there be a connection?

this particular wetland/ but because if you accept the

2

Court of .Appeals' reasoning a s to a piece of property

3

like this, then the functions that Congress recognized

4

adjacent wetlands perform for open water bodies will

5

never be regulated in the Sixth Circuit.

6

And I would like for a moment to just describe

7

a few of those functions.

8

listed in our brief.

9

Some of them arc beyond my scientific understanding.

There are a lot of them

Some

them are quite technical.

10

But using this map, I think we can just understand a few

11

of them.

12

One, and one of the most important, is

13

trapping of sediment.

14

of the reply brief, we have developed areas to the

15

northwest of Riverside's property.

16

we could suppose that the landowners in those areas

17

might water their lawns and fertilize their lawns with

18

chemicals, and then it rains.

19

rainwater wash off in whatever direction the land

20

slopes.

21

Again, using the map at the hack

As a hypothetical,

Those chemicals and the

24

25

their lawns here to fertilize their lawns are going to

In other words, it is to Lake St.

And therefore the chemicals that people put on

wash in this direction every time it rains, hut because

2

there is a wetland here filled with wetland vegetation,

3

that vegetation traps the chemicals and other sediment

4

that would otherwise wash into the open water bodies.

5

And basically what the wetland does is provide

6

a free water treatment plant.

7

sediment would otherwise eventually find their way into

8

the open water bodies.

MS. OBERLYt

Yes, she did, and she found it

3

wasn't vf>ry often, but it had happened in a manner that

4

was basically consistent with the flood cycle on the

5

Great Lakes, which is an eight to twenty year cycle.

6

The testimony in the record was that you don't have

7

annual flooding on the Great Lakes.

8

You have an uneven eight to twenty year high

9

and low flood cycle, which she found somewhere between

10

four and six, depending on your count, hew you count

11

Appeals was unhappy about that

14

"infrequency, but since in our view frequent flooding

15

isn't an element of the jurisdictional test in any

16

event, the frequency doesn’t matter.

17

What I am trying to point out is that wetlands

18

do perform this flood control function, and that when

19

you remove the wetland by filling it in, instead of a

20

wetland you need a Corps of Engineers flood control

21

project, and it is a lot more extensive than cattails

25

Congress was getting vehement complaints from
farmers and from foresters, others who said the Corps

2

our normal activities like maintaining drainage ditches

3

5

If you don't stop it,

One was to exempt the farmers' activities from

6

7

legislative definition the geographic scope of the

8

waters and wetlands subject to Corps of Engineers

9

jurisdiction, and the legislative history I have quoted

10

to you demonstrates that Congress deliberately rejected

11

the argument Riverside is urging in this Court, and

12

instead chose to opt for the exemption route, and what

13

it did in the new amendments to Section 404 was exempt

14

normal farming and forestry activities from any

regulation.

The other alternative was tc narrow by

that we know it is not just waters, it is also wetlands,

19

20

404(g) does is establish a mechanism whereby states who

qualify can take over the Section 404 permit program and

15

NR. WASHBURN;

Yes.
Congress in adopting the 1972

16

amendments, had something specific in mind.

17

had in mind was the fact that prior efforts at water

18

pollution control had been restricted principally by

19

agencies such as the Corps of Engineers, who had refused

20

to exercise jurisdiction over any water todies other

21

than waters that crossed state lines.

22

And what it

As a result, Congress in 197 2 sought to

correct what it perceived to be a severe limitation, and

24

to in essence follow cases decided by this Court

concerning the definition of navigable waters.

(202) 628-9300

The

1

legislative history, and in particular the conference

2

report to the 1972 amendments, is very clear on saying

3

what Congress intended.

4

It referred to cases of this Court, and then

5

stated that it was intending to brinn within the Clean

6

Water Act's regulatory scheme navigable waters that were

7

used in interstate commerce, their tributaries, as long

8

as they were connected tc interstate commerce, and then

9

articulated that there could either be a connection

10

through use of those waters in interstate commerce or if

11

the waters ultimately connected to some ether method of

12

interstate commerce.

13

QUESTION;

Do you think that there is no

14

indication that Congress would have been concerned about

15

pollution flowing from adjacent wetlands into navigable

16

waters of the United States, and want to regulate them?

17

MR. WASHBURN;

The Act does regulate that,

18

Your Honor, under Section 402.

19

ultimately ends up in a navigable water, it is subject

20

to regulation under Section 402 as a point discharge.

21

What we have here is attempting to define the area where

22

that pollutant may come .from if it is a wetland, and

23

beina a navigable water itself, in instances where there

24

is absolutely no connection between that wetland and the

25

water body.

If a pollutant

So in answer to your question, Congress was

2

Under the government's construction of the

3

Act, something in the neighborhood of 100 million acres

of wetlands will be covered.

5

not credible to say that Congress intended to regulate

6

this acreage, which is the size of the state cf

California, without ever having mentioned that fact in

adopted it in 1972.

10

We find this to be really

This is not to say that the Clean Pater Act

about the indefiniteness and imprecise nature and

perhaps even difficulties of determining whether or not
