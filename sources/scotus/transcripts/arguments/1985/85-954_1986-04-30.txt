ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARNOLD I. BURNS, ESQ»

5

ON

6

MR. BURNS;

7

EEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN NO. 85-955
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
/

8
9

This too is a case of statutory construction.
The question before the Court is whether an executive

10

agreement between two sovereign nations, the United

11

States and Japan, the practical effect of which is to

12

end whaling by Japanese nationals no later than April 1,

13

1388, is to be nullified by an interpretation of two

14

federal statutes known as the Pelly Amendment and the

15

Packwocd Amendment, which strips the Executive Branch, of

16

any and all discretion and mandates, mandates economic

17

sanctions against Japan, a country whose nationals take

18

whales in excess of the harvest quotas established by

19

the International Whaling Commission.

20

QUESTION;

You are not suggesting, then, if

21

Congress clearly intended to do that it wculd be

22

unconstitutional?

23

MR. EURNS;

No, I am not, Ycur Honor.

We are

24

talking about a statute enacted by Congress pursuant to

25

which Congress directed the Executive Branch to
4

(202) 628-9300

1

implement and to execute the law, and I think that

2

you'll find that as the argument progresses, Justice

3

White, there's been a very happy collaboration between

4

the Congress and the Executive Branch which has together

5

made tremendous strides over the years in the

6

conservation and protection cf shales.

7

QUESTION;

You wouldn’t know that from the

/

8
9

10
11

brief that the Congress has filed in this case.
MR. BURNS;
to embellish

So, you wouldn't, but I shall try

that point as we proceed.

The Pelly Amendment, the principal statute,

12

provides, and I should like to quote it;

13

Secretary of Commerce determines that nationals of a

14

foreign country, directly or indirectly, are conducting

15

fishing operations in a manner or under circumstances,

16

which diminish the effectiveness of an international

17

fishery conservation program, the Secretary cf Commerce

18

shall certify such fact to the President."

19

"When the

Now, if there is a certification, then the

20

statute goes on to provide that the President may direct

21

the Secretary of the Treasury to prohibit the bringing

22

or importation of fish from the offending country into
/

23
24
25

the United States.
Now, there is no issue in this case, we all
agree, that that portion of the statute dealing with the
c

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

President's authority is purely discretionary.

The

2

Packwocd Amendment, enacted

3

the Pelly Amendment was enacted, contains a similar

4

certification provision.

in 1979, eight years after

Under the Packwood Amendment, if there is

5

6

indeed a certification, then the Secretary cf Commerce,

7

working with the Secretary of State, must -- must reduce

8

the amount of fish by at least 50 percent that the

9

offending country can take from United States fishery

10

waters.

11

There is no issue in this case —

12

QUESTION*

That's the statute that we're

13

dealing with, cr we're dealing with the two of them

14

together?

15

MR. BURNS: Yes, but as the court below found

16

and as I think we all agree, the language which I gucted

17

in the Pelly Amendment is the language which the Court

18

must address in this case.

19

the sanction in the Packwood Amendment is a mandatory

20

sanction. -He all agree.

21

There is no issue but that

The National Whaling Commission, created by

22

the International Convention for the regulation cf

23

whaling, by the adoption cf schedules among ether things

24

imposed a zero quota for the harvesting of sperm whales

25

effective in April of 1984,

and adopted a complete

tc abide by them.

On November 13th,

7

There is no dispute in

1984, following extensive

/

8

negotiations in which the United States made it very

9

clear tc Japan that sanctions under these amendments

10

were definitely in the cards, the United States and

11

Japan struck a deal.

12

assiduously adhere to new quotas that were established

In exchange for Japan's pledge tc

in respect of sperm whales, minke whales and Eryde’s

that.

MR. EURNS*

Respondents, a ccaliticn cf

I classify it as an executive

agreement between two sovereign nations, Justice White,

binding on both.

And it was negotiated and signed by

the Secretary cf Commerce?
MR. BURNS*

No, it was negotiated and signed

17

by the Secretary of Commerce on the one hand, with the

18

approval of the Secretary of State, and a diplomat, an

authorized diplomat of the Japanese goverrment.

The court of appeals in this case, cne judge

the mandatory sanctions of Packwccd, a square holding

2

that the Secretary of Commerce in these circumstances

3

had absolutely no discretion in the certification

4

procedure, and that any departure from the harvest

5

quotas adopted by the International Whaling Commission

6

in any circumstances wculd per se constitute a

7

diminishment of the effectiveness of this international
/

8

arrangement requiring this mandatory sanction in the

9

Packwood amendment.

10

QUESTION:

11

Did the court of appeals majority,

.'General Eurns, hold out in sc many words that last --

12

that any violation of the harvest quotas would be a

13

diminishment ?

14

MR. BURNS:

In so many words.

it was a per se violation.
QUESTION:

They held that

We have difficulty, jurisdictional

20

difficulty, which we argue in our reply brief after the

21

issue was raised by respondents on the issue of standing

22

in the case to begin with.

23

QUESTION:

I understand.

I am not asking

24

about standing.

I am asking if -- dc you think this

25

statute incides a private cause of action for the — for

circumstances, it would, yes, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. BURNS;

You do agree with that?
If the decision belcw is reversed

7

and the international agreement between the United

8

States and Japan, which is the single most important

9

whaling nation in therworld, if that decision below is

10

reversed all whaling by Japanese nationals will surely

11

end by April

12

1, 1988.

If the decision below is affirmed, the

13

international agreement will be nullified.

economic sanctions will be issued against Japan.

QUESTION;

Would those sanctions be the

19

sanctions that.were in the wind, in the offing, two

20

years ago when the bargain was struck?

21

MR. BURNS;

Ch, yes, and Mr. Chief Justice,

22

you will find as one gees through this record that there

23

have been six instances in which certifications have

24

taken place, five of them under the Eelly amendment, and

25

in each of these five instances involving Japan and the

Soviet Union, Korea, Chile and Peru, sanctions that were

2

issued because when we brought them tc the bargaining

3

table ,the countries involved fell into line and in each

4

instance joined the International Whaling Commission.

QUESTION:

5
6

Has there been any instance where

the certification has not taken place?

7

MB. BURNS:

Justice Blackmun, there are three

10
11

instances in which certification has net taken place,
>one in

1979 involving Spain, one in

1980 involving

Taiwan, and one I believe in 1982 involving Chile.
In two of those instances there was no t a

12

clear.and definite showing that there had been a harvest

13

quota violation, but there was clear evidence that they

14

were heading for it.

15

negotiation and diplomacy.

16

But the issue was averted by

In the third case involving Chile, there’s no

17

doubt that there was a violation of the harvest quota,

18

and there was no certification.

only one certification involving mandatory sanctions and

that involved a certification of the Soviet Union just a

MR. EURNSs

1

And with specific reference tc

2

that, we need not speculate and we need net conjecture.

3

Justice Elackmun.

4

We know the answer tc that.

First of all, respondents argue that this

5

language, despite the fact that it drips with words cf

6

discretion, really is clear-cut and mandatory.

7

problem is that they do not really say that.

The

/

They say that the language of this statute

8
9

sometimes is mandatory and ministerial and wholly

10

lacking in discretion, and at ether times it is fully

11

discretionary and they do not tell us or enlighten us

12

:where the metaphysical distinction is.
Let me explain.

13

There are many matters which

14

are the subject of the adoption of schedules.

15

addition to harvest quotas you have proscriptions

16

against taking female whales, taking suckling whales,

17

taking -- there are prescriptions against taking

18

calves.

19

in certain geographical areas.

20

against uising certain kinds of harpoons.

21

In

There are proscriptions against taking whales
There are proscriptions

In all of those instances, as I understand

22

respondent’s argument and there is a concession to this

23

effect in the brief, and the court below has conceded

24

that in thoe circumstances under this very same language

25

ycuwould have discretion, and the Secretary of Commerce
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

felt that under the same language where ycu have a

2

harvest quota violation, there would be nc such

3

discretion.

4

QUESTION;

Mr. Eurns, may I ask, is there seme

5

kind of agreement which provides a five-year moratorium

6

on whaling ending in

7

MR. BURNS;

1990?
There is a, today a moratorium in

/

8

force without any termination date.

9

There is today —

10

QUESTION;

It is net finite.

Well, what's the Japanese

11

agreement, if there is a reversal — you have said that

12

Japan would be out of the whaling business in 1988?

>3

MR. BURNSt

14

QUESTION;

That’s correct.
Well, is it that,>or are they

15

simply going to abide by the moratorium, which as I

16

understood it, by its terms ends in

17

MR. BURNS;

1990?

They will abide by the moratorium,

18

but there are 91 nations in

19

Commission, Justice Brennan, only eight of whom are

20

whaling nations.

21

22
23

the International Whaling

There is practically no chance whatsoever that
that moratorium:will be changed.
QUESTION;

As a practical matter--

No, my question was, what is it

24

Japan has agreed to do in 1988, get cut of whaling

25

entirely, or simply to abide by the moratorium until its

MR. BURNSi

moratorium agd as a practical matter, we say, the

that this amounts to a cessation cf commercial whaling.

(202) 628-9300

1

At the time, in 1979, this is what was said concerning

2

the Felly Amendment.

3

Now, the question

must be asked, what did

4

Gcngress have in mind when they adopted the Fackwocd

5

Amendment.

6

sanctions at that time.

7

They may -- they provided for mandatory
Sha t did Congress have in mind?

And the answer to the question is very clear,

8

What Gcngress had in mind wa s, in adding teeth and

9

giving the Executive Branch additional negotiating chips

10

at the bargaining table, and the idea was that after the

11

Packwocd Amendment took plac e, that offending nations or

12

nations that might become of fending nations would no

13

longer have two bites of the apple.

14

have one bite at the negotia ting apple,

15

They would only

And, that is not c cnjecture on my part,

16

because Representative Brew said, "I understand under

17

the Felly Amendment as it ex ists there are really two

18

areas in which there are opt ional actions that can be

19

taken by the Administration,

20

a country is in violation of some international

21

agreement, and there is a lo t of flexibility in that

22

certification.

23

there is still discretion in determining whether a ban

Therefore, under Pelly we have two

1

2

discretionary features, whereas in the Packwccd

3

Amendment you are really taking all of the discretionary

4

features and petting them into their first category

5

which is the certification of a nation being in

6

violation of an international agreement.

7

precisely what they had in mine.

That tells us

8

QUESTION;

Mr. Burns —

9

QUESTION;

It*s not precise to me.

10

QUESTION;

Mr. Burns, may I inquire what the

11

effect is of the fact that Japan objected tc the quetas,

12

and therefore under the terms of the Act is net bound by

13

them?

14

all?

15

Dees that mean that Japan is net in violation at

MB. BURNS;

It means that Japan has the right

16

under international law, under the international compact

17

originally entered into once they filed the objection to

18

ignore the compact.

19

QUESTION;

20
21

But that fact has nothing to do

with the imposition or determination to impose sanctions?
MR. BURNS;

Well,

the point is that Japan in

22

this case clearly would have been violating and

23

departing from the schedules adopted, but was persuaded

24

net to fellow that course and an agreement was struck

25

whereby they would take, starting now, for example, 1986
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

through 1988, 200 sperm whales in each of these two

2

years.
They have taken 40C sperm whales in this last

3
4

year.
QUESTION;

5

Yes, but is there any effect at all

6

by virtue of the fact that Japan objected tc the quotas

7

and therefore supposedly wasn’t fecund fey them?
/

SR. BURNS;

8
9

The effect of that would be that

absent the negotiation, absent sitting down at a tafele,

10

absent'an agreement, Japan would be whaling and continue

11

tc take whales without limitation, subject solely tc its

12

own determination, subject only to its own discretion.

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. EURNS;

But subject to sanction?
And subject to the availability cf

15

sanctions under both the Pelly Amendment and the

16

Packwood Amendment.

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. EURNS;

Which seme might think were serious?
There’s no doubt that they thought

19

they were serious.

20

sanctions were clearly in the cards.

21

that they were told that, that persuaded Japan not tc

22

follow that course but to join in the community of

23

nations and tc leave seven whaling nations instead of

24

eight.

25

QUESTION;

It was the threat and the fact that
The record shews

seem tc have much binding effect to it; at least, it

2

permits a great deal of dilatory tactics here, doesn't

3

it?

4

MR. EURNS;

The answer to that is twofold.

5

'Cne, Mr. Chief Justice, is that you can, ve think, rely

In any event, we have suggested these are net

The central issue

12

before the Court is whether cr not the Secretary had the

13

discretion he purported to exercise here to agree net to

14

impose the sanction under Packwood-Waanuscn which all

15

sides agree is mandatory when there is a certification.

16

The issue, whether or not sanctions should be

17

mandatory or should be the subject of extensive

18

negotiation and diplomatic accomodation has been an

19

issue present in the debates over congressional

20

regulation of whaling from the very beginning.

21

as has been pointed out, the Pelly Amendment was passed

22

providing for a discretionary sanction cf banning

23

imports when

24

action diminishing the effectiveness of the

25

international whaling system.

In 1971,

the Secretary determined that there was an

(202) 628-9300

In that year, I might point out. Congress also

1

2

enacted resolutions for the first time favoring a

3

worldwide moratorium on whaling.

4

language of Felly is quite persuasive to the proposition

5

that the Secretary of Commerce had no discretion with

6

respect to the first stage of the process; that is to

7

say, the stage with respect to certification, and that

8

Congress clearly incorporated what it thought then to be

9

appropriate discretion with respect to the second stage

In our judgment, the

/

10

of the process, that is, whether or net tc impose

11

12

But if there is any doubt about the

13

appropriateness of that interpretation of Pelly, that is

14

to say mandatory on stage one with respect tc

15

certification, optional or discretionary with respect, tc

16

sanctions in stage two, in our judgment that doubt is

17

entirely removed by first the eight-year history of

18

administrative implementation cf the statute because, as

19

Mr. Burns has pointed out, there were five

20

certifications which occurred between the time Pelly was

21

enacted and the time Congress considered the

22

Packwood-Magnuson Amendment.

23

During that eight-year period in every

24

instance, as far as Congress was aware in 1979, in every

25

instance in which a nation had violated a numerical

to the President that a

And indeed, President Ford made the point

6

crystal-clear in his explanation cf the certificaticn cf

7

Japan and the Soviet Union in 1974 when he said, whether

8

or not the objection by the violating nation to the

9

quota is legal does not alter the fact that exceeding

/

10
11

quotas :will diminish the effectiveness of the convention.
It constitutes, then, he said, a prima facie

12

case; that is to say, a case which should suggest to the

13

President the exercise of his discretionary authority to

14

impose the sanction.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Sogers, a couple t'imes you

16

referred to diminishing the effectiveness of the

Fisheries Subcommittee of the Merchant Marine and

ample testimony both with respect to the eight years cf

I draw the Court’s

8

conceived that there was any discretion buried in the

9

"diminish•the effectiveness" language, in stage one of

10

the certification process, and the fact that Congress

11

relied explicitly on the representations of the

12

Executive Branch spokesman that the Packwcod-Magnuscn

13

Amendment then pending before the Congress would remove

14

all discussion from the process and automatically impose

the sanction that Packwood-Magnuscn was proposing, an-

But to go back to your point. Justice

O'Connor, there is good legislative history in our.

judgment, most particularly in the report with respect

24

violation should be certified.

25

QUESTION:

Well, I think the language that one
35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1

would have to look at is the language that says, when

2

the Secretary of Commerce determines that the fishing

3

operations are being conducted in a manner cr under

4

circumstances which diminish, all that language --

5

MR. ROGERS;

6

QUESTION;

Yes.
--which is perhaps not necessarily

7

definitive, doesn’t admit of the certainty that you

8

speak of —

9

MR. ROGERS;

In the abstract, ycu are right,

10

but in the context first of

11

Amendment in connection with whaling was directed to

12

reinforce Congress’s effort to strengthen the

13

International Whaling Convention system, and the fact

14

that as Congress saw it numerical quotas were the very

15

heart of that system.

16

the fact that this Felly

In cur judgment, therefore, a violation cf

17

quotas as posed to the other marginal violations that

18

Mr. Burns mentioned earlier cn, violation of that quota

19

:was understood atthat time to be something which

20

inescapably would diminish the effectiveness cf the

21

convention system because it was the maintenance of

22

rigid ceilings on takes, and in Congress’s view

23

hopefully, eventually a total moratorium cn any taking

24

whatsoever would inevitably constitute a diminishment<cf

25

the effectiveness of the Convention.
36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

To put it the other way, it is in cur judgment

2

very hard to comprehend hew the intentional violation,

3

the wholesale substantial violation of the supreme act

4

=cf the International Whaling Commission, that is to say

5

the establishment finally, after a decade of pressure

6

from the United States, the establishment by the

7

International Whaling Commission of a firm worldwide

8

global moratorium on any further taking of any kind of

9

whales .

10

The flouting of such a supreme act by the

11

Commission could enhance the prestige, maintain the

12

dignity, preserve the integrity of the Convention system.

13

QUESTIONS

Well, I know it*s not this case,

14

but suppose that it were determined or alleged that a

15

nation had taken a single whale by mistake.

16

MR. ROGERS s

17

QUESTIONS

18

MR. ROGERSs

By mistake?
After that moratorium.
We would net be here, and we

19

would not contend that it would diminish the effect.

20

would not contend that the taking accidentally of a

21

lactating:whale, which is prohibited under the

22

Convention system, where non-intenticnal flouting -- if

23

it were not an intentional flouting would diminish the

24

effectiveness of the Convention.

25

We

It's the Convention system that really is the
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

center of the scheme and the very reason why we’ re here .

3

Are you going tc deal with the

QUESTION;

2

availability cf mand arnus in

4

J5R . ROGERS;

Yes,

your oral argum ent ?
I’ll say a scrd about that,

5

if I may. Justice Rehnquist, as scon as I finish up with

6

respect to the legislative history point.

7

Iwculd suggest, with all due respect, that so

8

palpable is it that Congress was intending tc close what

9

it saw as the loophole in the Pelly Amendment by

10

enacting the Fackwood-Kagnuscn Amendment, that there

11

can’t be any dcubt about the appropriate interpretation

12

cf the Packwocd-Magnuscn Amendment upcn which we rely.
The idea that there is discretion with respect

13
14

to intentional quota violations lurking in the

15

certification stage is advanced really in this case fpr

16

the first time in history of the entire consideration cf

17

these statutes, and it would in our judgment bring in by

18

the back door the very discretion that Congress intended

19

to eliminate from the Packvocd-Magnuson statutory scheme

20

relating to the privilege of foreigners tc fish in cur

21

waters.

22

This is a view, incidentally, which was

23

embraced by the defendant, Mr. Baldridge, himself when

24

he communicated with the author of the amendment, Mr.

25

Packwocd, just a few weeks before he made the bilateral

\

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

arrangement with him when he said, in response tc Mr.

2

Packwood's statement, "I see no way around the logical

3

conclusion that a nation which ignores the moratorium is

4

diminishing the effectiveness of the IWC."

5

Mr. Baldridge said, MI agree."

Quote, "Since

6

any such whaling," that is tc say, in violation of the

7

quotas, "any such whaling attributable to the policies

8

cf a foreign government would clearly diminish the

9

effectiveness of the IWC."

/

10

Now, we don’t contend that this subsequent

11

exchange bears on the congressional intent in 1979.

12

have heard a good deal about deference to Executive

13

Eranch officials.

14

due to any Executive Branch official it's due to the

15

views and representations upon which Congress relied of

16

the senior officials who testified to the House in

17

connection with this Packwood-Magnuscn Amendment at the

18

time it was under consideration, Mr. Frank and Auguste

19

Negroponte .

20

You

In cur judgment, if any deference is

And in our judgment we are persuaded that the

21

Court will on its own examination of the legislative

22

history be similarly convinced that their testimony is

23

decisive as to the appropriate interpretation of the

24

Packwood-Magnuson Amendment.

25

2

Amendment# I noticed.

3

HR. ROGERS:

Well, I meant to say# and I will

4

mention again if I may. Justice O’Conner, in cur view

5

the legislative history of Pelly is as gocd, although cf

6

course net enlightened by the eight years experience

7

thereafter with respect to the legislative intent cf the

8

Congress at that time.

9

I draw your attention# if I may, tc our brief

10

at page 4 in which we point cut the legislative history

11

of the Pelly Amendment, and in addition. Your Honor, cn

12

page 18 and 19 of -- and specifically with respect tc

13

the statement of Representative Pelly at the bottom cf

14

page 19 in our brief, in which he explains that whales

15

are a notable example cf overfished resources.

16

And then, the legislative history goes on to

17

pcint cut thrergh Representative Dingell that in Secticn

QUESTION;

2

Way I ask. a question about the

3

language of the statute that troubles me a little.

4

There are in fact two parts, one, he must determine; and

5

if he determines, he must certify.
■

/

6

"to certify," is mandatory.

7

-

And the language,

Is it your position that the order should
/

8

compel him to make a determination he has net yet made,

9

cr that he should certify a determination that he has

10
11

already made?
HR. ROGERS;

It’s an issue that we hadn’t

12

focused on. Justice Stevens, because the order as it

13

came out of the district court was an order enjoining

14

the agreement, but I would suggest that the order

15

appropriately, if it’s expressed in affirmative,

16

mandatory terms, would be that he certifies, that he has

17

no discretion not to certify.

18

QUESTION;

But that is if he has made a

19

determination, but we treat it as though it is so clear,

20

that the facts are there, that he must certify that he

21

has made a determination even if he hasn’t?

22

he hasn’t made a determination —

23

HR. ROGERS;

Apparently

He hasn’t made a determination,

24

but our position is, on that, that an intentional

25

wholesale violation of a numerical quota, and most

7

Your Honor,

"I have dete rmined

15

With respect to remedies and a va riety of

17

judgment the courts below were correct in d etermining

18

Well, but you know, we don't have

many cases where a writ of mandamus has been issued tc a

You have not had many cases

either where his authority is so clearly limited as it

was here.

2

we are fully entitled to a declaratory judgment and

4

QUESTION;

You say the Secretary should not

5

have purported to permit another country to take a

6

certain number of whales contrary to the moratorium?

7

MR. ROGERS;

Gorrect.

He had nc authority,

/

8

and he was exercising a particularly clearly delegated

9

responsibility from the Congress.

The responsibility

10

that he was exercising.was the responsibility to

11

administer the 200-mile fishing zone.

12

One law in 1976 told the Secretary, issue

13

licenses for foreigners, issue allocations to

14

foreigners.

15

told him, take those allocations tack if anybody

16

violates a numerical quota from the Whaling Commission.

17

The other law in 1979, Fackwcod-Magnuscn,

Congress had the authority to give that power,

18

to give that responsibility.

MR. ROGERS:

No.

Chief Justice, and I also would not say that merely

political questions in general, this Court should stay

24

MR. BURNS:

Thank you, Chief Justice.

25

The Secretary in this case did indeed make a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

finding and did indeed make a determination.

He said

2

after consulting with reputable scientists, after

3

consulting with our United States representative to the

4

International Whaling Commission, and after consulting

5

with the Secretary of State cn some delicate foreign

6

policy considerations, he said, and this is in our

7

Addendum 3 at page 6-A, and I quote, "I believe that a

8

cessation of all Japanese commercial whaling activities

9

would contribute more to the effectiveness of the

/

10

International Whaling Commission and its conservation

11

program than any other single development."

%

12

We rely on plain language which clearly gives

him discretion.

14

15

The Congress had three opportunities to

In 1971 when they passed the Pelly Amendments

16

and we too have challenged our adversaries to show us

17

legislative history, language to the contrary, they have

18

not done so.

19

In

1978 the Pelly Amendment itself was amended

20

and it is very clear that the Congress, and our papers

21

demonstrate, regarded this as a discretionary matter.

22

In

1979 when the Packwocd Amendment came up,

23

Congress had the perfect opportunity to take the middle

3

harvest quotas under the International Whaling

4

Commission, that is ipso facto a violation.

5

Packwocd introduced such a bill.

It did not pass.

So that, we have a very clear legislative
