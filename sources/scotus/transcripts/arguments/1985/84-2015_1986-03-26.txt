ORAL ARGUMENT CF HO HARE N. ELLMAN, ESC*,

8

ON BEHALF .OF THE APPELLANT

9

10

MR.

ELLMAN*

Than* you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

11

Court, this is a land use regulatory taking case that

12

comes from the State of California.

13

The California state courts dismissed

14

appellant's complaint in this case for legal

15

insufficiency, finding it insufficient to state a claim

16

for relief under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to

17

the United States Constitution and under Title 42,

18

Section 1983 of the United States Code.

19

Now, as a result of that procedural situation,

20

we stand before you asking for a remand of this case to

21

the California courts for trial of the issues of fact,

22

and the issues of fact will address the three key

23

elements of a regulatory taking case, and I would like

24

to frame those issues, because I would like to discuss

25

each of them or at least aspects of each of them in the
3

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

argument today within the framework of our claim.

2

The first is the question of rightness.

Shat

3

if we can prove, as we have alleged in the complaint ,

4

that what occurred in this case was not simply the

5

denial of a subdivision map but the imposition of

6

regulations which preclude the County of Yolo and the

7

City of Davis from allowing any use of the property of

8

any kind whatsoever except uses for agricultural and

9

open space.

10

It is our contention that under the rightness

11

theory articulated by this Court in the Hamilton Bank

12

case and the other cases which have dealt with that

13

issue that such a result would be a definitive result,

14

definitively applying the regulations to the property in

15

question, and that those determinations are essentially

16

issues of fact for a trial.

17

Sew, assuming that we overcome that hurdle,

18

what if we can prove, as we have alleged in cur

19

complaint, that the restrictions applied to the property

20

of MacDonald, Sommer, and Frates deprived that property

21

of all of its economic use and deprive the property

22

owner of their reasonable investment-backed

23

expectations.

24
25

It is our contention that if we succeed in
doing that, that we will have established a taking, a
4

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

regulatory taking within the precedents which this Court

2

has articulated, some of tham as recently as the

3

Connelly case, which I guess is just abcut a ircnth old

4

today.

5

And finally, if we prove the restriction as I

6

have described it, and if we approve its impact as we

7

have pleaded it, what is the remedy, and here, as you, I

8

am sure, are aware, the California courts have

9

categorically denied

that there is any possibility tc

10

recover compensation in a regulatory taking context.

11

Indeed, if you will look at Footnote 57 at

12

Page 27 of our reply brief, we have given you some

13

history cn the Gilliland litigiaticn where the

14

California Supreme Court has gone to great lengths tc

15

cause depublication of an opinion of the Court of

16

Appeals that suggested that its position cn the issue of

17

compensation might be somewhat different than that which

18

was held by this Court here.

19

QUESTION;

Shat is the significance, counsel,

20

of depublication from the Supreme Court of California tc

21

the Court of Appeals?

22

HE.

EILMAN*

The opinion when it is

23

depublished under the rules can no longer be cited as

24

authoritative in California courts, so for all practical

25

purposes the opinion ceases to exist for everybody

And I take it that that position of

7

the California courts means that you would not have an

8

opportunity to prove what you say you could prove in

9

this case.
ME.

10

ELLMAN;

Well,

yes, that's true. Your

11

Honor, and actually the court has decided against us in

12

California, so the California issues, I think, have teen

13

resolved, and I think it is Joint Appendix 132 or right

14

thereabouts —
QUESTION;

15
16

Well, why are you precluded now

from proving what you say you can prove at trial?
ME. ELLMANs

17

As far as -- well, because the

18

California court has said we failed to state a cause of

action.

MB. ELLMAN*

Well,

the court also said because

we failed to plead a taking ty the taking standard which

it applies, and you see, that is an issue which we

6

believe implicates federal constitutional principles.

QUESTION;

the police power —

What is wrong with it saying on

what was before it that you didn’t plead a taking?

Because they just misunderstood what the law was?

I think sc, Your Honor, yes.
In terms of your well pleaded

complaint?
MB. ELLMAN;

17

Yes, sir.

And it is a confusing

opinion.

19

Appendix, you will see where the court agrees that we

20

have well pleaded the issue of futility, and yet later

21

on in the opinion at Joint Appendix 13U, I believe, the

22

court says, nonetheless, having pleaded futility, we

23

should have made another application.

doesn't really make much sense.

The court —

We plead that any application would be futile.

14

Bear in mind what occurred

Yes, but the Court of Appeals says

net so.
MR. ELLMARs

Well, the Court of Appeals said

not so on a case dispositive pleading motion.

that — I don't think that -- if it is possible for a

state court to find against a complaint cn a case

21

the defendant in the case, the County Board cf

22

Supervisors, if you will, you are in a situation where a

plaintiff who accuses a local governing body of having

violated your constitutional rights can insulate itself

25

from any liability by making a finding that it hasn't

11

us of a constitutional right.

12

QUESTION*

But the observation of the

13

California Supreme Court, rather, the California Court

14

of Appeals was that if you had asked for a less

15

intensive residential use, and you were asking for seme

— more than four homes to the acre, as I recall,

perhaps the zoning board would have gone along.

Why would they go
*

MR. ELLMAN *

6

Well, the mandate case is a case

7

which is in the nature of appellate review.

It is

8

initiated by a petition, and it is tried on an

9

administrative record, and typically you file it with a

10

memorandum of points and authorities, and an alternative

11

writ is issued which directs the administrative body to

12

set aside what it has done subject to review of the

13

administrative record.

14

with a claim followed by an answer and with discovery.
QUESTIONj

15

It is not like a case initiated

Why wouldn’t that case in the

16

normal course of events have gone forward before this

17

one?

That is one thing that puzzles me.
MR. ELLMAN*

18

I can give you seme history on

19

the mandate case.

At the time this lawsuit was

20

initiated, this Court had not yet decided Fern Central,

21

and there was tremendous uncertainty in the law as it

22

developed.

23

that you could not comfortably join a mandate action as

24

part of an action, a normal civil action which might

25

proceed on the basis of discovery and with an answer and

In addition to that, it was our perception

As the litigation'developed , though, when it

2
3

became clear that the California courts were only going

4

to allow the remedy of invalidation as a result of the

5

mandate petition, we took the position that that is a

constitutionally inadequate remedy, and so that -QUESTIONS

MR.. ELLMAN*

I don’t lelieve that is true.

10

Justice O'Connor, with all due respect.

11

ycu need cnly say that if we can plead, if we can prove

12

what we have pleaded, the very simple, straightforward

cognizable under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment and

that you could seek application for a less intensive

Correct,

that was -- and, see, we

of aspects where we thought that what they did to us was

is that I think those are California issues in that we

and may it please the

the appellant’s complaint here alleges that the

* ccunty denied cne relatively intensive subdivision

5

proposal based upon specific planning, public service,

6

and safety reasons.
We advance two basic propositions.

7

First,

8

denial of one specific subdivision proposal is not a

9

final determination as to how the appellant’s land may

10

be used, and thus no ripe taking claim has been alleged

11

by the complaint.
Second, even if ripeness is found to exist

12
13

under these allegations, the allegations of this

14

complaint do net state a taking whether analysed under

15

either the just compensation clause or the due process

16

clause .

17

I world like to address some of the remarks

18

that were made in counsel's prior argument in regard to

19

the urban development policy of the county.

20

have a decision of the Court of Appeal that rules as a

21

matter of California law that the denial of cne specific

22

Yes, as long as the property is

31

county and the city is that development in areas that
are outside the city and outside the existing ccunty
service area must annex to one or the other.
The next finding says the City of Eavis has
opposed because it is inconsistent with its general
plan, and then 11 says, therefore, essentially, the only
means of providing sewer service is to annex to the CSA,
the County Service Area, which the appellant has not
dene, has net taken any proceedings tc dc.
That was not a finding that because of the
city’s opposition this proposal couldn’t be approved,
and that would clearly be contrary to California law.
Cities do not have the ability to control land use
cutside their boundaries.

They can plan and they car.

object like any other citizen could, but they cannot
control that extraterritorial land use power.
Again, it is cur position that the attempt
here to in effect prove, to claim that the appellant can
prove that the uses which the Court of Appeals said are
available to it is not a matter of proof.

It is a

matter of law based upon the regulations of the county,
which under California law the Court of Appeal has
determined does permit the lesser residential cr
ncn-agricultural uses.
Our ripeness position essentially is that

The Court in Penn Central recognized this, and

HR. OWEN*

3

I don't believe he does, nc.

In

4

fact, you could apply for a variance without ever even

applying in the first case fcr the subdivision.

variance procedure is an independent type of permit

asking fcr relief from some identified portion of the

county's zoning regulations.

The

9

Here the county's basis for denial, although

10

they are articulated in separate sections, essentially

11

fall under their zoning policy to promote sound and

12

orderly development and to require that intensive urban

13

subdivisions be served by public streets.
The reason that the variance procedure is

14
15

absolutely critical here is that it provides two

essential elements.

basis for the hardship claim.

The map review process is one that under state

with the hardship or claim of special circumstance cf

The second critical factor in the variance

Thus we believe at that point the hardship claim

, In addition to tha variance relief, the Court

10

of Appeal specifically found that without regard to the

less intensive but still valuable development.

these uses have been pursued.

And finally, a fourth form of relief that

16

would have relieved the property owner from economic

that there is rc vested right in that prior zoning.

Is that it?

8

MR. OWEN;

Correct.

9

QUESTIONt

I see.

10

MR. OWEN;

A second basis for our taking

11

contention is that the allegations of the complaint only

12

address a discrete 44-acre portion of the total 167-acre

13

land holding, and makes no reference at all as to the

14

overall economic usability or viability of the parcel,

15

and it is cur ccntenticn that it is no different really

16

than the setback type of case or height limitation case

17

where a discrete portion is alleged to be economically

18

not viable, but no allegation is made as tc the economic

19

viability of the property as a total land holding.

20

And finally,

cn the taking issue, we believe

21

that the Court of Appeal has specifically held that

22

there are valuable development uses available here under

23

the city's zoning regulations — or the county's zoning

24

regulations, and that the developer is not precluded

25

MR. OWENi

I believe it has the ability to

Would that apply to property within

MR. CWENs

The city actually cannot — it does

not provide utility services outside its limits except

10

in a cooperative basis with the county or the county

11

service area, tut the city dees have the ability, I

12

think., within its own city limits to say we are not

13

going to extend services because it is inconsistent with

14

cur general plan, and there never has been a general

15

plan request made to the city.

16
17
18

QUESTION*

So that the city could decline to

extend any of its services to the 15-acre tract?
MR. CWEN*

Oh, no,

the portion that is in the

19

city — that is another thing I ought to point out.

20

There is a portion of this 167 acres that is in the

21

city, zoned residential, and there was an application

22

which came within a whisker cf being approved in what —

23

the city has an annual development review process
