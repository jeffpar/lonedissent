2

witnesses that testified, on numerous occasions the

3

prosecutor, and as evidenced in the joint appendix,

4

provided information tc that grand jury that was part of

5

its considerations in an unsworn, non-testimonial

6

fa shion.

7

There are numerous instances where the

8

prosecutor, in this instance Assistant U.S. Attorney

Hoffman, provided a number of incidents as tc who was in

explaining to the grand jury the difference between

15

collect calls and third party billing.

16

Those facts become important because this new

17

indictment, this indictment that we have labeled

18

superseding indictment, is almost a creature of design.

There appears not to be a definition for it.

3

And apparently satisfied with that, no

There is no definition.

The Federal Rules

4

don't anticipate it, sc the procedure is somewhat

cumbersome, because it obscures an examination of the

prejudice or the potential error or harm as a result of

what occurred in this case.

Was there any finding of prejudice

in this case?

MR. ROSEN*

There was no finding by the

district court level of prejudice on any of the three

counts before the court.
QUESTION;

13

And certainly no finding by the

14

Court of Appeals of prejudice?

15

MR. ROSENs

Correct.

But I would submit to

16

the Court, it's not the existence of prejudice; it,;s the

17

inquiry of locking for it that this Court throughout

18

history in this decade has abhorred, a district court

it be for a defendant's benefit, whether it be for the

Government's benefit, going behind it to examine or to

HR. ROSEN;

Correct.

There was a temporary-

7

argument proposed by the Government, temporarily adopted

8

by the district court and forever abandoned, this

9

concept of a

joint witness.

And the joint witness they

10

proposed to the first district court -- and there were

11

two district courts.

12

One was ill.

The first district court adopted it, saw

13

nothing inappropriate with the rule to allow witnesses

14

to testify in tandem.

15

there was the transfer to the second district judge,

16

Copenhaver, the defendants, upon another decision in the

17

same district for the same type of violation, filed a

18

petition on Hay 22nd,

19

asking him to reconsider in light of this ether

20

violation and the fact that it was dismissed pretrial.

Upon renewing the motion, and

misrepresentation and at worst lie, the issue would have

9

been resolved at the pretrial stage.

10

As the Government argues cr

As the Government even concedes in its

11

petition or brief in support of their petition to the

12

Fourth Circuit, it says that at a pretrial stage really

13

what you’re confronted with is "the temporary

14

inconvenience of resubmitting the matter to the grand

jury as opposed to potential prejudice."
