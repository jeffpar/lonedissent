vr. Goldburg, I think

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. GOLDBURG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case the ILA

attempted to organize a

group of ship superintendents, and the union is alleged”

10

to have told the man it could get them their jobs back

11

if they were fired for union activity.

12

The first issue to consider is whether the

13

defense of federal preemption is waivable.

14

Garmon case,

15

arguably subject to Section 7 or Section 8 of the Act,

16

the states are deprived of subject matter jurisdiction.

17

Since the defense of federal preemption deprives the

18

Court, the State Court of subject matter jurisdiction,

19

the defense should be nonwaivable.

20

that the Court noted in Garmon in reaching this

21

conclusion is that the LMRA is not merely a matter of

22

substantive law.

23

National Labor Relations Board, with specially designed

24

procedures, and the Court recognized that a variety of

25

local procedures and attitudes could lead to

In the

this Court said that when an activity is

Among the factors

Congress created a tribunal, the

inconsistent adjudications just as easily as

2

inconsistent rules of substantive law.

3

QUESTION*

Then it is your submission,

Mr.

4

Goldburg, that a defense like this could have been

5

raised even for the first time on appeal?

MR. GOLDBURG;

Rehnquist.
QUESTION;

9

That is correct,

And what if the judgment had
coul you collaterally attack the

judgment because of lack of jurisdiction?

11

MR. GOLDBURG;

No, I do not believe that the

12

judgment could be collaterally attacked.

13

understanding that the Court has held that subject

14

matter — well, in a sense,

15

question then wculi be a matter of full faith and

16

credit, and I believe full faith and credit does not

17

preclude inquiry into jurisdiction.
QUESTION*

18

It is my

it — I'm sorry.

The

I got the impression from your

19

brief that som .> of your arguments about subject matter

20

jurisdiction ware based on the idea that it can be

21

raised, or based on cases arising in the federal

22

courts.

23

court system?

24
25

Why should these be carried over to a state

MR. GOLDBURG;

Because In Garmon I believe

that this Court held that Congress deprived the states

of subject matter jurisdiction to rule on this type of a

2

controvrsy.

3

jurisdiction away, and therefore the states have no —

4

Congress took

QUESTION*

the subject matter

Well, of course,

the Supreme Ccirt

5

of Alabama answered that by saying that cur trial courts

6

of general jurisdiction have jurisdiction tc try in this

7

representation case.

8
9

MR. GOLDBURGs

But the fact that -- well,/ I

think all states have courts of general jurisdiction,

10

and if merely by the state giving one of its trial

11

courts general jurisdiction

12

on a decision to take subject matter jurisdiction away,

13

national labor policy would be frustrated.

14
15

QUESTIQNi

Well, does the term — does the

Garmon case use the term subject matter jurisdiction?

16

MR. GOLDBURGi

17

QUESTION^

18
19

they could overrule Congress

It says jurisdiction?

Yes, but why do you use the term

subject matter jurisdiction?
MR. GOLDBURG*

Well,

I think that's the onl:

20

jurisdiction that the Court could have been talking

21

about because the Court was very concerned with a

22

variety of local procedures being applied by the states

23

and a variety of attitudes being possessed by the states

24

on labor controversias, ani I think the only way that

25

Congress could ensure that these types of issues were

I think it was purely

I don't think there was any strategic

motiva tion.
QUESTION*

11

It wasn’t — well, I suppose the

12

Alabama courts could lcok at it as an effort to get a

13

favorable judgment on the merits, and if you don’t get

14

that,

15

then you raise this point afterward.
MR. GOLDBURG*

But I just don’t see how we can

16

infer a strategic motivation because we -- you say

17

favorable judgment.

18

like the union was ..oping there would be a favorable

19

decision written.

20

It was a jury trial.

It wasn’t

It seems to me that —

QUESTION*

Well, you know, I agree that it^’s

21

perfectly possible, I suppose, the union could win the

22

case before the jury,

23

wasn’t it?

MR. GCLDBURG*

Well, if the defense of federal

24

preemption had not been upheld, say, on a pretrial

25

motion, they still would have gotten a jury trial.
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I

just don't see lany reason for a union or the lawyer who
was trying the case to holi back on a defense and risk
waiver.

I mean, if they had thought of the defense» I

don't think they would have risked waiver.
It would have been very simple for the trial
court to raise federal preemption cn its own» sua
sponte, because the allegations of the complaint show
that the alleged misrepresentation arose from
organizational activity.
QUESTION;

Well, that would be a rather

strange rule of law to require a trial court to raise an
issue that a party was in a far better position to raise
than the trial court.
MU. GJLD3URG;

Well, under the Alabama rules

of civil procedure, the court is to raise subject matter
jurisdiction sua sponte.

It's the same as the federal

rules as far as that's concerned.
QUESTION;

Well,

yes, but presumably, you

know, you have your typical generalist trial court judge
has to be familiar with a number of different areas of
law, to expectlhim to raise it when a party in whose
interest it is to raise it doesn't know enough to raise
it would be a rather strange rule.
MR. GOLDBURG;

But I think this Court said in

Lockridge that the Court designed the arguably protected
7

(202) 628-9300

1

standard so state trial courts could very easily police

2

themselves in this area.

3

because if they make the wrong decision, the issue will

4

go to the state appeals court cr ultimately this Court

5

on appeal, but they can satisfy any interest in

6

efficiency, in integrity and in finality cf the trial

7

court proceeding by raising

the issue sua sponte.

Indeed, in this particular case I don’t

8
9

They don’t have tc be right

believe there was any waste of trial time at all because

10

the Alabama Supreme Court indicates in its opinion that

11

even if they didn’t think the defense was waivable, they

12

don’t think federal preemption applies on the merits,

13

and it’s clear from that that even if the defense had

14

been raised say, on a motion to dismiss, and the trial

15

court had granted a motion to dismiss, the Alabama

16

Supreme Court would have sent the case back for trial

17

because they said in their footnote they didn’t think it

18

was preempted.
QUESTIONS

19

Kr. Goldburg, can I ask you, do you

20

think it makes any difference what kind of preemption it

21

is?

22

actual — it’s actually prohibited or actually

23

protected, and others arguably prohibited and arguably

24

protected.

25

just arguably protected or prohibited, that it still

2

MR. G0LDBURG:

Justice Stavsns, as I read

3

Garmon, the same standard applies for arguable or

4

actual.

5

QUESTION:

Well, if you take that view,

6

supposing you had a case in which you had an arguable

7

remedy before the labor board so that you can't go

8

forward in the state court, and the party went before

9

the labor board and then lost and determined that it no

10

longer was arguably prohibited?

11

12

preempted?

13

MR. GOLDBURG:

Would then jurisdiction

Yes, I think once

there has

14

been a clear determination by the labor board, not just

15

the regional director, b;

16

the labor board, once there has been a clear

17

determination, that supervisors are involved, I believe

18

at that point that the states could apply -heir law,

19

that they would have jurisdiction.

His

Yes, but —

Can a union misrepresentation be an

unfair labor practice?
MR. GOLDBURG*

A union misrepresentation can

21

generally be an unfair labor practice.

22

this particular representation could not have been an

23

unfair labor practice for the simple reason this was a

24

representation —

We concede that

possibly argue that this plaintiff should be foreclosed

2

from a state court suit when there is no way that he

3

could get any remedy against the union before the

4

board ?

5

MR. GOLDBURG*

Well, if he had followed his

6

procedure before the board, he wouldn’t have needed a

7

remedy as far as the ILA was concerned.

8

had found that he was an employee, the board could have

9

reinstated him with back pay.

10

If the board

If, on the other hand, the beard had found

11

that he was not an employee, I believe at that point he

12

would have had a remedy against the union.

13

that point we reach our argument that the Alabama claim

14

of its strict liability should be preempted at that

15

point, anc

16

a supervisor rather than an employee,

17

standard should apply in terms of the representation

18

that you would make.

However, at

QUESTION*

Well, that’s way down the line.

MR. GOLDBURG s

21

We are talking about misrepresentation which

Yes.

22

is, granted, a law of general application here, hut the

23

Court has held that state tort law can be preempted

24

because tort law is indeed a method of controlling

policy.

Could the state court keep the case pending in

view would it have an absolute duty to dismiss the case

MR. GOLDBURGt

Well, my view is they would

have to dismiss the case without prejudice since they

wouldn’t have any subject matter jurisdiction.

MR. GOLDBURG;

Well, I — many states have an

extention ox the statute of limitations for that type of

4

a situation where, say that the first action is

5

dismissed on a technical ground that doesn’t make --

QUESTION;

It’s aot a technical ground.

It’s

one of subject matter jurisdiction.
MR. GOLDBURG;

But subject matter jurisdiction

is addressed to the jurisdiction of the court.

10

QUESTION;

Right.

11

MR. GOLDBURG*

It’s not addressed to the

12

question of whether substantively plaintiff would have

13

had a course of action if the court had jurisdiction.

14

So many states hava extensions of the statute of

1'i

limitation for that type of situation.

13

state has a six month extension of the statute of

17

limitations for that type of situation.

8

I believe my

We are involved with organizational activity.

19

It is important for the anion to be able to solicit

20

argual employees in this type cf situation sc that the

21

employees can learn the advantages and disadvantages of

22

organization from others.

23

In the Hanna Mining case, this Court held

24

that, or it was stated that organizing supervisors is

25

not even arguably protected, but in — the critical

2

determination that supervisors were involved, there had

3

been an appeal from the regional director to general

counsel.

5

present case, and therefore these people are arguably

6

employees.

7

There has been no clear determination in the

QUESTION*

What -- was there a collective

8

bargaining contract?

9

bargaining contract at all.

10

There

UR. GOLDBURG*

wasn't a collective

No, the parties did not proceed

11

to the point of collective bargaining although the

12

superintendents signed authorization cards;

the union

13

never got to the point of sitting down with

the

14

employer, perhaps once the coercive discharges of Davis

15

and Trione took place, the organisational drive really

16

fell apart.

17

I believa that in this case the state interest

18

in applying its law is exceedingly weak.

19

superintendents, after all, madf a Section 7 decision

20

that they would affiliate with the union and authorize

21

the union to engage in collective bargaining for them.

22

Obviously the Stata of Alabama has no interest in

23

regulating this Section 7 decision that the

24

superintendents made.

25

The

The state also has a very little interest here
1U
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

in protecting the eraplcyment relationship of these

2

people that were fi rei for union activities because the

3

Alabama state law is that it is a hiring at will, and

4

the employer could fire them for really any reason

5

wh atsoever.

6

The statement that was allegedly made by the

7

union that the superintendents could get their job back

8

embodies with it an opinion that the men are being told

9

that they are employees rather than supervisors.

Based

10

on the federal policy of free debate that this Court

11

recognized in the Linn and Austin cases, I believe these

12

type of opinion statements should be protected.
Further, Section 8(c) of the act which,

13
14

although by its terms it applies to written

15

communications, I think goes on to say that views,

16

arguments or opinions are not evidence of an unfair

17

labor practice and

18

protected.

19

therefore should be arguably

In this case, as I have said, the plaintiff

20

did not seek his remedy before the NLRB.

Instead, he

21

filed a state misrepresentation action in which an

22

essential element of

23

of the representation on the part of the ILA.

24

had to find that Davis was in fact a supervisor to

25

conclude that the representation that the ILA made was

the cause of action was the falsity

feels it has a concern to protect its people against
