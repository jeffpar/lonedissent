General

13

Hcornstra, does the Wisconsin Legislature define any

15

MR. HCORNSTRA;

Yes, Your Honor.

We have

16

another statute that prohibits our purchasing department

17

from buying the goods from those that have demonstrated

18

a proclivity to discriminate against minorities, women,

19

and a rather expanded class of protected persons within

20

the equal rights area.

21

QUESTION;

Is that a similar pattern, if

22

they've been found guilty on three separate occasions or

Are there situations under the

labor practice in order to get judicial review?

7

HR. HOORNSTRA;

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

You are penalizing that particular

employer, aren't you?
NR. KCORNSTRA:

10

Well, permit me first to say

11

that those questions, I believe, are all Fourteenth

12

Amendment, questions, not NLRA pre-emption questions.

13

may be that our statute is subject to infirmity for

14

those reasons,

but not

It

for NLRA pre-emption.

Let me turn more directly to the question of

IB
16

whether it’s a penalty.

In response to Justice

17

O'Connor's question, I think we have to concede that the

18

opposite side of the coin, of

19

to reward the best in corporate America,

20

going to have as an effect the same thing as though a

21

penalty were exacted on the violator.

the same coin, cf trying
is that you're

The effect is the same only in this respect,

22
23

and

it's a narrow effect.

That is that they are going

24

to have a lost business profit-making opportunity,

25

it stops and it starts right there, and I think I can
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

but

1

demonstrate that this is not a penalty within the

2

remedial concept of the NLRA and the machinery of the

3

NLRB by a number of different considerations.

4

First is, Your Honor, that question wouldn't

5

arise, were a private employer, a private company

6

standing here rather than the State.

7

because we instantly would discern a distinction between

8

the economic pain, that befalls someone who has lost a

9

customer, from a regulatory penalty.

It wouldn't arise

10

We can admit the effect is the same in other

11

respects, but there is that distinction, that we would

12

say if a private employer were here, that is an economic

13

pain, not a remedial penalty.

14

Second, T think that as the holding of this

15

Court in Camden crystallized the meaning of the market

16

participant cases, insofar as the state does act as a

17

proprietor or as a consumer, there can be -- there can

18

be no conflict or interference with the federal

19

regulatory machinery.

20

Further, this Court in the withdrawal of

21

subsidization cases has held

tha t a penalty is not

22

involved if a sovereign state or th e federal government

23

withdraws subsidy for the exercise of even a fundamental

24

constitutional right.

Finally, in respect to the question, Justice

We have two premises that underlie our basic

8

argument.

One, any private company could do exactly

9

what we have done.

It would be free under the National

10

Labor Relations Act to do exactly what we have done.

11

Any private consumer could make exactly this precise

12

choica, and I believe that is conceded by the appellee.

13

Second,

the second premise is, the states

14

enjoy the same

rights as any private company when it's

15

doing the same

thing, namely making a proprietary choice

16

or a consumer choice.

17

second premise, because that I want to dwell on inasmuch

18

as the appellee does not concede it.

19

There are two sources for this

First, the dormant Commerce Clause cases

20

expressly have held that the states, when operating in

21

the free market, may operate freely and as stated in

22

Reeves specifically, svenhandedness as a matter of

23

federalism, evenhandedness requires that states operate

24

as free from federal constraint as a private company.

25

So,

simply as a general matter of our

2

sector regularly does and have on our proprietor hat,

3

have the same freedom.
QUESTIGNi

4

we

Of course, that may be true under

5

the dormant Commerce Clause and not true where Congress

6

has affirmatively enacted a law such as the NIEA, I

7

suppose .
MR. HOORNSTRAt

8
9

Yes, sir.

I come to my second

source because of exactly that question.

The

next

10

logical question is, that might be true as a general

11

matter,

12

the answer is yes.

but is it true in an NLRA situation, and I think

First, as noted, the private company could do

13
14

this.

Second, there is nothing on the face of the NLRA

15

to distinguish the states acting as proprietors from the

16

private companies.

17

specifically has put the states in the position of

18

protected proprietor and the protected consumer in the

19

NLRA itself.

Third, I think this Court
the

I have in mind as a lead case the 1959

20
21

decision of this Court,

22

where one of our — which, incidentally, is a Wisconsin

23

activity of unions.

1 2
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The question is, is the state or a political

2

subdivision within that principle of secondary boycott

3

law when it's trying to build its buildings, that it

4

preserves its own freedom of choice of a trader, or is

5

the state, because it’s a state or a political

6

subdivision removed from these protections of neutrals

7

in the business economy who are to be free from this

8

Kind of union coercion.

9

This Court clearly held that even though

10

states and political subdivisions are not employers

11

covered by the f.ct, and even though there is what we

12

call the Garmon pre-emption doctrine, when it comes tc

13

preserving the freedom of choica that the secondary

14

boycott law is all about, the states and the political

15

subdivisions enjoy those same benefits.

16

May I give this example to further illustrate

17

that the states under the NLRA, Justice Behnquist, enjoy

18

the same prerogatives as though there weren’t an NLRA

17

That's why one of my early responses to Justice

come back to this point.

That's correct.

So , I want tc

We have a different set of

10

inhibitions that will restrain us, that won't restrain a

11

12

from this decision, just as there is nothing restraining

a private company from this decision, and it’s this

convergence of two distinct capacities that come

together here.

But there is nothing restraining us

QUESTION;

Can the state decide that it won’t

purchase from any unionized company or employer?
MR. HCORNSTRA;

19

yes, and the other side of that coin, it said it can

have contracts, the state can have a contract with union

21

23

That,

QUESTION;

Your Honor, remains undecided, in

would be free tc say,

(202) 628-9300

MR. HOORNSTRAi

1

Under the NLRA , that's right.

2

But I would have a First Amendment problem, being a

3

state, because of freedom of association rights, and I'd

4

have a Fourteenth Amendment problem but I don't think

5

I'd have an NLPA problem.

6

If I may approach this from the perspective of

7

burdens and presumptions, I want to suggest tc the Court

8

that the appellee has the burden here of defending the

9

Seventh Circuit's decision for these reasons.

First, it

10

is clear, I believe conceded,

11

a general matter could do exactly this and that as a

12

general matter a state can do what a private company can

13

do, absent a Fourteenth Amendment or First Amendment

14

problem.

15

that a private company as

That being so, and the intent of Congress

16

always being the touchstone in an NLRA pre-emption case,

17

the burden switches to my appellee friend tc say where

18

it is that Congress has singled out the state for

19

disparate treatment.

20

QUESTIONj

Let me interrupt you again.

21

Supposing Wisconsin had a statute and said, no private

22

company in Wisconsin may buy from a labor law violator.

23

And there's no objection to that, I suppose, except

24

possibly pre-emption.

14
15
16

Why is the state entitled to different

MR. HOORNSTRA;

Because in the circumstance

you raised, the state is acting as a lawgiver.
QUESTION;

But what has that get to do with

17

pre-emption?

18

is that difference related to the pre-emption issue,

19

because you're asking, what lid Congress intend.

20

I understand that's a difference, but why

MR. HOORNSTRA;

Because the pre-emption issue

21

-- the pre-emption issue turns on where you've got con

22

flicting regulations and when the state acts as a

23

regulator, as a lawgiver in an area acted by Congress,

24

that's what pre-emption is about.

to the questions posed by Justice O'Conner concerning

10

the purpose of the state's enactment.

11

12

less than clear with respect to what its purpose was in

13

enacting the labor law violator debarment statutes in

14

22

Eehnquist, I agree with you that the purpose of the

23

state is irrelevant if the effect is to interfere with

24

the federal statutory scheme.

25

I believe, however,

that the purpose of the

there is any legitimate state interest in an area of

5

interest is only of peripheral concern.

6

QUESTION*

And so, then it really turns on

7

what sort of an argument the Assistant Attorney General

8

for the State of Wisconsin makes to the Seventh Circuit?

9

MR. GANGEMI;

Insofar as that is a statement

10

of the purpose of the statute, no, I do not -- in the

11

final analysis T agree with you that the purpose of the

12

statute, the object of the statute, is irrelevant.

13

It is the effect of the statute and its

14

potential for interfering with the federal statutory

15

scheme that is cf , in the final analysis, of utmost

16

importance under the supremacy clause.

17

QUESTION;

Well, then, what if the state is

18

concerned about having steady source of supply cf

19

whatever the product is that it’s buying, and it doesn't

20

want to buy from somebody who's engaged in labor

Have you told us?

If you

I wanted to underscore the

4

statements of purpose of the State of Wisconsin below,

5

which I think have not been really set forth in the

6

briefs before this Court.

7

the — from the very beginning, defendant's brief in

8

opposition to the motion for preliminary relief, which

9

appears in the record at R-8, page 15, Wisconsin said

Just a couple of examples, is

10

that the Wisconsin statutes simply encourage obedience

11

to law as federally adjudicated.

12

Likewise, the defendant's brief in support of

13

its motion for summary judgment which appears at R-22

14

states that;

15

discouraging labor law violations, and the state, as a

16

market participator in the purchase of the goods and

17

products, can sc restrict its purchases so as not to

18

promote labor law violators as an exception to the

19

Rational Labor Relations Act pre-emption."

20

"The state has a deeply rooted policy of

Again, "It" -- meaning Wisconsin at page 18 of

21

this document -- "It will not make purchases from

22

23

24

companies in compliance with federal rulings.

25

is not engaging in state regulation of private labor

1

conduct but is merely seeking to influence private

2

conduct already prescribed by federal labor policy."

3

The underscoring of "influence private conduct" is

4

Wisconsin's.

5

And finally,

"Wisconsin has a long history cf

6

fostering labor relations consistent with the goals of

7

the National Labor Relations Act, and if in its wisdom

8

the legislature determined that the state should not

9

make purchases from freguent labor law violators, that

10
11

is the state’s prerogative."
Most telling was the brief in opposition to

12

the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment which

13

appears at R-24.

14

said, explaining why it was not bound by what the

15

Congress had done in rejecting penalties under the

16

statute, it saidj

17

policy of enacting state debarment procedures for its

18

contracts is not relevant here."

19

At page 16 of that document Wisconsin

"Whether Wisconsin was wise in its

The fact is that its views are different from

20

Congress’s on this matter.

21

therefore, that the purpose of this statute is not

22

merely the state declining to do business.

23

I think it’s obvious,

It has to be recognized that the purpose of

24

that declining to do business is not some legitimate

25

state economic interest but merely to seek enforcement
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

of federal law.

This is also clear from the statute

2

itself, again addressing myself to Justice O'Connor’s

3

questions and points.
This statute is net limited to current labor

4
5

disputes between an employer and a union where the state

6

makes the judgment that this labor dispute will

7

interfere with the performance of the contract.

8

the state in that type of situation could make the

9

judgment that the labor dispute might affect performance

10

and therefore the state would have a legitimate economic

11

interest in the statute — in the labor dispute which

12

may underpin the statutory violation.
QUESTIONS

13

Thus,

In your view, could the state adopt

14

a policy of honoring every lawful union request to

15

boycott the products of an employer whose employees are

I suggest that that is mere
