arm of the prosecution,

MR. WARD*

prosecution is literally identical in the proceedings.

8

It's a test run, as it were, of the case.

9
10
11

QUESTION! Does the magistrate have to find
probable cause beyond a reasonable doubt?
MR. WARDi

No, I stani corrected on that.

The

12

magistrate does not have to find probable cause beyond a

13

reasonable doubt, but so far as the evidence that may be

14

presented and the test of the evidence, it is the same

15

in a preliminary hearing.

16

QUESTION*

Yes, but the prosecutor needn’t put

17

on more evidence than he thinks necessary to show

18

probable cause?

19

MR. WARD*

That’s guile true, Justice White.

20

QUESTION*

And often the defendant never puts

21
22

on any evidence at all?
MR. WARD*

Oh, that’s quite true as well.

23

Yes, certainly, it is often simply a prima facie showing

24

on the part of the prosecution, but equally as oft°n, I

25

think, although there’s no empirical data to establish

2

our position is very simply that we're dealing here with

3

judicial proceedings.

4

with a preliminary hearing.

5

QUESTION*

No, indeed, there is no --

Be are concerned here, of course,

Well, a grand jury proceeding can

6

be characterized, many of the same attributes that you

7

attribute to the preliminary hearing.

8
9

HR. WASDs

Well, I suppose that is true in

certain instances but so far as the scope of what we

10

claim, Justice C'Connor, our position is that we're

11

dealing with adjudicatory proceedings where we have

12

adversaries or we have parties that are presenting

13

differing views and a neutral magistrate is making

14

decisions upon those views.

15

We believe that the net that would be cast cut

16

on a rule based upon our case which is a preliminary

17

hearing case should incorporate adjudicatory proceedings

18

where opposing coansel are present.

19

would take in most if not all of pretrial proceedings.

20

But the reason why we so fervently believe that that is

21

the case is because the logic

22

applied first to the trial in Richmond newspapers and

23

later to the jury voir dire in the first Press

24

Enterprise case, we thought Press Enterprise won, the

25

logic that was applied in both of those cases is

That, granted,

that this Court has

9

1

overwhelmingly similar in the application to cur

2

3

proceedings in general,

4

that this Court has found apply in those instances as

5

well, and to some degree the argument can be advanced

6

even to a greater degree in those instances.

7

QUESTION*

because the values of openness

Mr. Ward, to merely cut it, the

8

grand jury in California and the preliminary hearing

9

both accomplished the same results?

10

KB. WARD*

Yes, to cause the defendant to be

11

brought before the Superior Court, except that the

12

preliminary hearing is paramount in that it is required

13

for all defendants. Justice Marshall, yes.

14
15

QUESTION*

Well, what if the grand jury brings

up an indictment?

16

KB. WARD*

If the C rand Jury --

17

QUESTION*

I'm not trying to -- I'm trying to

18

-- say you're entitled to go to one but not the other?

19

MR. WARD*

I understand, but —

20

QUESTION*

— a one sentence reason , why

21

you're entitled to go to the preliminary hearing but not

22

to go before the grand jury.

23

MR. WARD*

I understand the question, Justice

24

Marshall, and I feel uncomfortable arguing foreclosure

25

of any proceeding, but arguments could be advanced that

the grand jury proceeding is an investigatory process.

2

We do not seek access to the police investigatory

3

process.

4

5

QUESTIONS

But do you have to go as far as say

it’s not the judiciary —

6

MR. WARDs

Yes, we suggest that that is a

7

logical line to be drawn, dealing only here with

8

adjudicatory proceedings where the parties — where

9

opposing parties are present to litigate the matter

10

before a neutral magistrate.

11

QUESTIONS

Could there be, could there be some

12

preliminary hearing in which the Court could be

13

justified in the exercise of discretion to close it to

14

the public?
MR. WARDs

15

Yes, wa believe so. Justice

Burger.

17

qualified right to access, as this Court has found, as

18

it has found it in all other instances, and that

qualified right requires definition, and frankly we seek

20

nothing new in connection with the definition of the

21

standard that we propose in connection with the

22

preliminary and with pretrial proceedings.

23

We think that our right is obviously a

set by this Court in the cases that you have determined

QUESTION*

That, I take it, means that a

4

HR. WARD*

Yes, a hearing would be part of it,

5

Justice Brennan, yes.

We feel that hearing and notice

6

for closure.

14

We feel that before

25

MR. WARDi

The use of change of venue. Justice

Rehnguist, has always been one of the alternatives
1 2
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

available to the Court to avoid closure, and an

2

alternative available to the Court to provide a fair

3

trial to the defendant, and our answer is yes, that that

4

would have to be considered by the Court as one of the

5

alternatives that would be available before closure

6

could be pronounced.

7

QUESTION* So,

the defendant would have to be

8

tried in a county in a different part of the state so

9

that the Riverside County proceeding could be opened up

10

to the press?

That’s what you’re saying.

11

MR. WARD*

12

QUESTION* That’s what you’re saying, isn’t it?

13

MR. WARD*

We're dealing,

of course —

In the end if the only alternative

14

to provide a fair trial is a motion for change of venue,

15

and that contrasts with the right of access, cur answer

16

is yes, that the values attaching to access and open

17

proceedings predominate and they must of necessity -—

18

the proceedings must be open regardless of the

19

possibility that a change of venue must be one of the

20

alternatives that can --

O'Connor's feeling that California must be the only

14

Hell, I think the use of the title

analysis in Gannett as well, looking to the history of

the proceeding, I think it's important to consider what

18

we’re dealing with here by way of a preliminary hearing.

Would you think, Mr. Warren,

procedure?
MB. WARD*

10

I think

that the circuit courts and

11

some of the reasoning -- well, I will not refer to this

12

Court but some of the circuit courts have found that the

13

suppression hearing is not a candidate for closure.

14

Indeed, it is sc similar to the trial itself because it

15

involves the presentation of trial evidence, that in

16

fact it is a definite candidate —
QUESTION*

17

Let me put the question another

18

way.

Is it within the discretion, sound judicial

19

discretion of the trial judge, the person presiding, the

20

person presiding over the preliminary hearing to say

21

that if all the evidence which is sought to be

22

suppressed is disclosed and is on the evening newspapers

23

and television stations, it’s going to impair the right

24

of the defendant to a fair trial if the evidence is

25

suppressed at the preliminary hearing?
