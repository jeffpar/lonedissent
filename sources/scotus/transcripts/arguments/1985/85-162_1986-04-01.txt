ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BARDACKE*

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court*
The defendant in our case was convicted of a

upon reliable evidence.

13

is whether the defendant must now be released because of

14

the form of one piece of that reliable evidence.

that trial properly applied the reliability test,

14

The Supreme Court of New Mexico never did

that.

18

Dutton, in Roberts, in Green, this Court has resisted

any per se inadmissibility rule and rather suggested

20

that the courts below look at the — weigh the various

21

competing issues, interests,

look at how badly the state

needs this kind of evidence,

and look at the rights of

the defendant.

evidence, the trial judge properly applied the

2

reliability test set forth in Roberts.

3

QUESTION*

General Bardacke, you would have

4

had a hard time getting this evidence in in.1er

5

traditional evidence rules, wouldn’t you?

6

MR. BARDACKE:

Hell, it’s a statement against

7

penal interest, and there is a rule in New Mexico

8

identical to the feieral rule.

9

declaration against penal interest.

10

QUESTION*

Clearly, this was a

But the declaration against penal

11

interest was insofar as he implicated himself, but it

12

wasn’t against penal interests so far as he implicated

13

his confederate, was it?

14

MR. BARDACKE*

Yes, he implicated himself so

15

much that he was convicted of first degree murder, and

16

he implicated the defendant, in which he said*

17

slit the guy’s throat twice, but the defendant here shot

18

him in the head twice.

19

QUESTION!

Look, I

3at when he talks about the
■%

20

defendant shooting him in the head, the other defendant

21

shooting him in the head twice,

MR. BARDACKE*

that isn't against the

Hell, as a matter of fact it

24

was, because it was in his presence while they were both

25

kidnapping him and while they were both conspiring to

commit murder
Subsequently, he was convicted of conspiracy

3

to commit murder as well.

4

the declarant's declaration against penal interest and

5

the penal interest of the defendant in this case.

6

So there is a nexus between

There was no admission at any time against the

7

defendant in this case that didn't inculpate the

8

declarant as well at the time that the man was

9

conspiring to commit murder.

I mean, historically the

10

confrontation clause was closely tied tc the compulsory

11

process clause.

12

QUESTIONS

Well, does the New Mexico rule

13

apply as well, the rule you cite, to custodial

14

statements?

15

MR.

This is post-arrest.
BARDACKEs

Tes.

I think that custodial

16

statements require close scrutiny, but I believe under

17

state law, as under federal law, they are never per se

18

inadmissible.

19

state declaration of penal interest which applies a per

in this case

2

QUESTION!

3

the federal rule, is that it?

4

ilell, they purported to be applying

MR. BARDACKE t

Yes.

What the New Mexico

5

Supreme Court said was that Ohio v. Roberts, the

6

applicability of that case applies only to prior

7

testimony that is subject to prior cross-examination.

8

And-I think

9

and nothing in confrontation clause decided by this case

that there's nothing in the Roberts opinion

10

— after that point, that in fact would limit the

11

applicability of Ohio v. Roberts to just prior testimony

12

subject to cross-examination.

13

QUESTION!

If Ohio against Roberts was not on

14

the books in this Court, could they have reached the

15

same result on the state law?

16

MR. BARDACKEs

I think that if the New Mexico

17

Supreme Court had reached the state law, they would have

18

determined that in fact the statement was reliable and

19

admissible, and upheld the conviction.

20

with Ohio v. Roberts on the books, an excellent approach

21

was given by this Court to determine whether cr not this

22

hearsay that was uncross-axamined at a prior judicial

23

hearing should be admissible.

24

QUESTION!

25

But I think that

Mr. Attorney General, you rely on

the reliability test, which I think is correct.

And

1

yet, is it not true that Boeglin, if that's the way ycu

2

pronounce his name, had a selfish motive in giving the

3

confession he gave?

4

that he said all he did was try to cut the man’s throat,

but his knife was dull and he didn't cut deep enough to

kill him, so he did not die from the efforts of Mr.

Because my understanding of it was

So he was trying to save his own neck, and the

10

question in my mind is whether that can be viewed as

Well, Justice Powell, it’s an

excellent point.

15

opportunity to test the reliability of what the trial

So I think that

May I ask you, you just talked

10

about Ohio against Roberts.

about Douglas against — what is the case?

12

MR. BARDACKEi

13

QUESTIONS

14

MR. BARDAlfCEs

Do you have anything to say

Douglas v. Alabama.

Douglas against Alabama.
fes, Justice Stevens.

I think

15

that case is not analogous to this case in that in

16

Douglas v. Alabama we did not have an exception to the

17

hearsay rule.

18

statements of a prosecutor who, under the guise of

19

refreshing the recollection of the defendant, tried to

20

get in his own testimony.

25

As a matter of fact, all we had was the

Now, how could the testimony of a prosecutor
be tested for reliability?
QUESTIONS

Well, but he was just trying to

prove what the co-defendant had said.
MR. BARDAOKEi

Well, but he did it through an

1

improper way, ani I think that Douglas v. Alabama is

2

more a case of prosecutorial misconduct.

3

event, the issues that are before the Court in Ohio v.

4

Roberts and in this case are not issues that were before

5

the Court in Douglas v. Alabama, because here it cannot

6

be contested that in fact we do have a valid exception

7

to the hearsay rule that was admissible and found

8

admissible by the trial judge under the two-pronged test

9

of Ohio v. Roberts.

10

But in any

And I think that that two-pronged test in the

11

name of good policy,

12

good judgment, is the kind of test that this Court has

13

been seeking to have trial courts utilize in deciding

14

whether hearsay should be admissible.

15

in the name of common sense and

Even in the per se — excuse me.

Even in

16

Hanson v. Braithwaite,

17

pretrial identifications with their inherent problems of

18

reliability, I think this Court refusal to issue a per

19

se inadmissibility kind of rule, but said that the Court

20

should examine each case and examine the state’s

21

interest in law enforcement, the state’s interest in

22

developing evidentiary rules, and not supply a brittle,

23

hard and fast par se inadmissible rule.

where we have the suggestive

And clearly, that's what the court in this
case did in the Supreme Court of New Mexico.
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I think

1

what the Supreme Court did ns they just wiped out a

2

whole class of hearsay, without any gauge to the

3

reliability —

4
5

QUESTION*

What whole big class did it wipe

cut?
MR, BARDACKEi

6

It wiped out statements out of

7

court, third party confessions.

I mean, clearly the

8

confrontation clause doesn't allow cross-examination in

9

all cases.

But if you read the holding of New Mexico

10

versus Earnest, you would wipe out all prior out of

11

court statements not-subject to cross-examination at a

12

prior judicial hearing.

13

In other words, that was the fact —

14

QUESTION*

15

Haven't they already been wiped

out?

16

MR. BARDACKEi

17

QUESTION*

18
19

I don't believe —

Under the regular rules of

evidence?
MR. EARDACKE*

I don't believe so.

I think

20

there are exceptions to the hearsay rule, and I think

21

there is an interrelationship between --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION*

jut of court statements, all out of

court statements are admissible in New Mexico?
MR. BARDACKEi

Not admissible.

They are

admissible if, for instance in our case, if a declarant

3

QUESTION;

Let’s leave our case.

I’m talking

about this great big group of cases you’re talking to.

4

MR. BARDACKE;

Well, certainly dying

5

declarations have been admissible without implicating

6

the confrontation clause since the time of Mattox, I

7

believe, an 1895 decision of this —

8

QUESTION;

That exception is as hold as this

,

14

Yes.

I think there are other

e xceptions.

12
13

MR. BARDACKE;

QUESTION;
out, would

But so this case wouldn’t wipe that

it?
SR. BARDACKE;

I don’t believe so.

But

15

certainly the language of this case would implicate not

16

only the facts of our case, but also situations where

17

witnesses have fled the jurisdiction, situations where

18

witnesses have died.

19

So the ramifications of the holding in this

20

case go far deeper, and would overrule many longstanding

21

decisions of this case.

22

New Mexico Supreme Court in 1985, and I believe it has

23

significant ramifications, and that’s why we’re asking

24

this Court to remand and have the New Mexico Supreme

25

Court determine whether the trial judge in this case

This case was decided by the

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

abused his discretion in determining there was

2

sufficient reliability and sufficient corroboration to

3

make this admissible.

4

I think —

5

QUESTIONS

General Bardacke, do you think the

6

confrontation clause as interpreted by this Court in

7

Ohio against Roberts allows the states to admit into

8

evidence things that perhaps would not have come in

9

under traditional hearsay law and that perhaps wouldn’t

10
11

come in under the federal rules of evidence?
NR. BARDACKE;

I think it does.

I think that

12

in Ohio v. Roberts, once the first prong of

13

unavailability is decided, this Court puts forth a rule

14

that says, if it's a firmly rooted exception to the

15

hearsay rule, then we will infer reliability; if it is

16

not, then we will rule that the evidence is not

17

admissible unless there are sufficient indicia of

18

reliability that woali make the testimony helpful and

19

make it promote the cause of the confrontation clause,

20

which is in fact to promote the accuracy and

21

truth-finding process in a trial.

22

So it’s conceivably by applying that test ycu

23

might admit something

that would not be admissible

24

through the traditional rules of evidence.

25

certainly that's not the circumstance in this case.

But

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The

1

circumstance in this case is that it is admissible as a

2

valid declaration against panal intarast.

3

It- is clear that the defendant in this case —

4

I’m sorry — the declarant in this rase was

5

unavailable.

6

every possible motion that it could have to provide a

7

live witness who would take the oath, who would be

8

subject to cross-examination .

9

It is clear that the state went through

But that was not available in this case, and

10

the only way the state could get this probative,

11

reliable evidence to further in this case the state's

12

interest in law enforraraant was the mathoi in which it

13

did.

14

We would urge this Court to reverse the New

15

Mexico Supreme Court and in fact ask the court then to

16

determine whether or not it was sufficiently reliable

17

and whether the trial judga dii his job and determined

18

that in fact it was admissible and good, probative

19

evidence upon which the conviction of this defendant

20

could be based.

21

Thank you very much.

MS. SULIIYANs

2

Mr.

Chief Justice, may it

please the Courts
I can think of no more important trial right

3
4

for a defendant in an American courtroom than tha right

5

to cross-examine the witnesses who are brought by the

6

prosecution to testify against him.

7

defendant, Respondent in this Court, was tried for a

8

capital offense and he risked suffering the death

9

p en alt y .

In this case, the

The conviction in this case rests almost

10
11

exclusively on the custodial unsworn, uncounseled

12

statement given by an alleged accomplice, Philip

13

Boeglin, who had earlier in the afternoon made two

14

statements in which he denied any participation in this

15

offense whatsoever.
The

16

state argues that this is a statement

17

which should be admitted even if the declarant is not

18

available for cross-examination because, since it was

19

against Boeglin’s penal interest to make the statement,

20

it falls within the declaration against penal interest

21

e xce ption.

22

Mow, the state pins its argument of Ohio

23

versus Roberts, and I think there are two different

24

considerations that I want to focus on.

25

of cross-examination and what Ohio versus Roberts means

First, the idea

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

in the continuity of Sixth Amendment cases emanating

2

from this Court; but second, I want to look briefly an

3

the end of my argument at some problems which may arise

4

from the language usel by the Mew Mexico Supreme Court

5

in its opinion.

6

I think basically that Ohio versus Roberts

7

follows that line of cases -- California versus Green,

8

Pointer versus Texas, Barber versus Page -- in which the

9

Court has had occasion to consider when prior

10

cross-examined testimony could be used where the
V

11

declarant is not available at the time of trial.

12

And it seems to me that Ohio versus Roberts

13

follows consistently those prior decisions if one

14

assumes, as the Court found,

15

had an opportunity to cross-examine that key prosecution

16

witness and in fact vigorously cross-examined her at the

17

preliminary hearing.

18

that counsel in that case

That's not what happened in this case.

19

Boeglin was never cross-examined by trial counsel in

20

this case.

can respond is that in a subsequent case involving

That’s State versus Owens.

SR. SULLIVAN*

What was that exception?
There was a communication, I

15

It was a gambling transaction,

But it was a statement made -- when I said

person which arguably inculpates him.

19

I cannot really defend the language of

the New

20

Mexico Supreme Court opinion, which I think does suggest

21

a departure from the decisions of the Court.

22

though, that the decision must be read strictly on the

23

facts, and that in this case what we’ve really got is a

24

classic case of a statement that has never been

The entire thrust of the Respondent's argument

8

is that the statement that the trial judge admitted was

9

unreliable.

The Supreme Court of New Mexico never

10

reached that issue.

The Supreme Court cf New Kexicc, if

11

it applies the second

12

correctly, can in fact test the reliability of that

13

statement and determine whether the trial judge abused

his discretion in admitting that statement.

That was

We seek that this Court reverse and remand to

Mexico apply the proper test.
Counsel for Respondent assures us that:

19

Well,

20

in New Mexico jurisprudence they in fact are not

21

applying this case in terms of what it says: everyone

22

understands that in fact that the court didn't really

mean that.

Certainly that's not what happened in Owens.

least, there is a presumptive unreliability of a

21

22

MR. BARDACKEi

If it is presumptive, it's

23

certainly rebuttable, and certainly the trend of these

If this Court were to support the New Mexico

5

a first for this Coart or any federal court to hold

has that option.

I think this Court, Justice

13

White,

I would urge this Court,

14

however, to reverse and remand to the New Mexico Supreme

15

Court so the New Mexico Supreme Court can made that

16

determination as to whether the district judge abused

17

his discretion in determining this was sufficiently

18

reliable and corroborated by sufficient physical and

19

testimonial evidence that it was worthwhile and in fact

20

enhanced the cause and purpose cf the confrontation

clause to add to the fairness and accuracy of criminal

trials.
