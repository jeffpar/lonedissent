amendment, part of the Tax Equity and Fiscal

the spenddown period is part of the methodology

for

determining income eligibility, and concluded that the

MR. WITHER BY*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

Now that I *va raviawai the context of the 1982

10

TEFRA amendment and its legislative history, the

11

question is what lessons there are to be learned from

12

that history.
The first lesson is that Congress' use cf the

13
14

tar*

"uthoiology" was employed in TEFRA in direct

15

response to the Secretary's use of the term in the new

16

1981 regulations implementing OBRA.

That use cf the

17

term claarly dii not encompass tha soanliown or the

18

length of the budget period .
This is a strong indication that Congress* use

19

20

of the term "methodology" also did not include or

21

encompass these subjects.

22

tha TEFRA aaani.mant was ona of continuity, not of

23

change.

scheme, the Secretary expressly authorized the six month

2

spenddown.

3

Indeed, Congress expressly reaffirmed the

financial eligibility regulations which were in effect

5

prior to 03BA, including specific listing of those

6

regulations, among them the six month spenddown

authorization.

the manner in which the Secretary has implemented the

Isn't that really what we're

That's ultimately an issue

that we get to,

19

issue, let me point out that the Respondents acknowledge

20

that for tna period up to 1981 at least, and possibly up

21

to 1982, it was perfectly lawful for the Secretary to

22

permit states to have a six month spenddown , and

therefore in effect

the regulation at issue here serves that purpose.

11

Now, I've addressed some of the legislative

12

history that indicates why the Respondents' argument is

13

incorrect with respect to the 1981 and

I would alsc like to mention briefly, as we discuss in

15

greater detail in our brief, why Respondents' view makes

16

no sense even on the face of those amendments.

17

1982 amendments.

The basic distinction between the medically

18

needy and the categorically needy is that the medically

19

needy have, excess income, income above the state's level

20

of need.

21

Income, it has no application whatever to the

22

categorically needy and no counterpart in the cash

23

assistance programs.

25

Since speaidown refers exclusively to excess

Uhy?

Because the categorically needy by

definition have no excess income.

13

In light of the difficulties that the

14

Respondents have with the language in'the statute as

15

amended, and in light of the fact that the legislative

16

history demonstratas that Congress had no intent to do

17

what the Respondents argue and the court below held, and

18

in fact specifically reaffirmed the regulation that had

19

been in existence for at that point 17 years, now about

20

20 years, it is cur position that you can’t ask for a

clearer iniication that Congress agrees with the

Flease the Court»
Tha courts below correctly construed Section

16

(a)(10) cf the Medicaid statute as invalidating the six

17

month income budgeting policy by relying on its clear

18

statutory language and also by giving some secondary

19

meaning to the legislative history and the events

20

surrounding its enactment.

\

21

Both the trial court and the Supreme Judicial

analytical framework for statutory interpretation set

forth by this Court two years ago in the Chevron case.

the state and the United States is that they ignore that

due .
Moreover, in the unique circumstances cf this

Let's look first at the plain language of the

19

20

statute.

It is not simply about a methodology in some

21

sort of a vacuum, but rather about determining income

22

eligibility.

23

eligibility both for the 331 cash program and for the

24

aid to families with dependent children program is

25

determined monthly.

And it is undisputed that income

and in many ways

is the real change that was made in the programs here.

What the state and the Secretary are arguing is

essentially what was argael unsuccessfully by the

And with

reference to this particular section.

Section (a)(10),

11

the Secretary said, rather cryptically, that the statute

was self-implementing, and so therefore the Secretary

earlier, in the De Jesus case, for example, of giving

the Respondents that should

and that these inquiries into somewhat murky legislative

11

history and certainly into giving deference to the

12

Secretary simply are not supportable under the

13

analytical framework that’s required to determine this;

14

and that in fact the position of the Supreme Judicial

15

Court reflects the true intent of Congress in making all

16

of the programs reality specific, applying them on a

17

monthly basis, because that’s when individuals need that

income to live on, to pay their other bills, their

non-medical bills.

we submit that the Supreme Judicial Court
