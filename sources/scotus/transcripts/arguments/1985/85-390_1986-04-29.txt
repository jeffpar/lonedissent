ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FEREZi

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
This case is before you today as a result of a

12

decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

13

decision the Ninth Circuit held that the City of Lcs

14

Angeles may not limit access to its public utility

15

poles, public utility ducts, by way of an option

16

process, if space permits further construction.

18

In that

Before I commence argument, Your Honors, I
:*ould like to state the key points of my argument and

19

then briefly summarize the facts.

20

only about digging up streets and hanging coaxial cable

21

on utility poles.

22

This case is really

Point number two, cur process is net unique.

23

It has evolved over two decades* worth of experience, in

24

approximately 7,000 other situations in this country.

25

The proper First Amendment analysis is the third point.

The public fcrum dcctrine says that in a
ncn-public fcrum mode, nondiscrirainatcry regulations
need only be reasonable.

Very briefly, Ycur Hcnors, the

5

key facts of this case are, the City, pursuant to

6

California state law, requires a cable operator tc

7

obtain a franchise.

9

The City awards these franchises through a
competitive bid process, and we select only one

franchisee.

fact that it's on city rights cf ways, we control the

That's correct. Your Honor.
And you 're going to tell us pretty

soon why that's reasonable?
MR. PEREZ;

I will tell you in ay reasonable

reasonable.

23

There are some — in our view,

There's nothing in the complaint that limits

basis of content?

3

MR. FEREZ;

There are certain areas where I

think arguably, someone could allege, as the Ninth

5

Circuit held, the impermissi tie risk of covert

6

discrimination.

7

prcgramining tc see -- cr to justify the substantial

8

terminal interest that we believe is present, and that's

information diversity.

We ask for broad categories of

10
11
12

Congress studied that in Cable Act, a very
lengthy discussion of that,

and found that that was a

.governmental interest that we should be concerned about.

13

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Ferez, the complaint,

14

though, alleges that it is entirely feasible tc string

15

another cable cn the poles, and that according tc the

16

allegations of the complaint it would not be a burden to

17

sity owned property tc enable another cable tc be

18

strung, and serve the same areas of the City that the

19

City wants served.

20
21

22

Now, faced with those allegations, hew should
:we on a 12-3-6 motion determine that the City has a
sufficient interest tc prevail ever that?

23

MR. FEREZ;

Well,

Your Honor, let me get tc

24

the reasonableness portion of my argument, and I think

25

I'll address that for you, and I appreciate your

2

and you want tc look at the face cf that document and

3

make a determination.

I appreciate the fact that this is a 12-B-6

4

But, we would urge you, that number cne, you

5

don’t have to do that; and number two, the substantial

6

governmental interests that are present outweigh that.

7

You can balance that, and that’s what we’re talking

8

about here, a balancing process in a reasonable

9

proportion.

10

Let me discuss that with you.

Ke believe we

11

are in a non-public forum category, and in a ngn-pcllic

12

forum category, absent content regulation which we

13

maintain we have here,:we have a reasonableness test as

14

this Court has enunciated in Cornelius, Perry and

15

Greenberg.

Now, we believe our process is eminently

to phrase the exact question that was answered by the

whether or not Preferred was entitled to build its cable

He said the question:was

He didn’t say anything about public property

Now, when the Ninth Circuit posed the question

17

it said, you know, is there a right to limit this thing,

18

and it used in there, in its phrase, "public utility

19

facilities and other public properties."

20

21

source of a major amount of confusion, and cn the briefs

One point I want to make. Your Poncr, and I

12

would like to address this to Justice O'Ccnncr, I

13

appreciate yocr concern, Your Honor, about the facts in

14

the complaint, but our position is that even if they are

15

all true, the City still acted reasonably.

16

We made certain legislative assumptions based

17

upon experience with other cities, as this Court said we

18

may do in the Redman case, sc even if the facts are tree

19

and even if:ve acted and it turned out to be different

20

than what we assumed, that's net important.

of law, this Court can still hold that there is no

that, but just the economic interest at stake and the

interest in kind of managing a good operation, you might

say .

Do you take the position that the economic

interest alone would be sufficient to justify a

municipal decision to license only one operator, even

natural monopoly, but rather the City just thought that

16

it would be in the interest of the public if they were

able to manage an operation and it met all the standards

that you've got here, to be sure they have good

Would you think the City would do that, just

Would that stand up under the First Amendment,

HR. FEREZ;

I think the City if they wanted to

could operate a cable television system.
