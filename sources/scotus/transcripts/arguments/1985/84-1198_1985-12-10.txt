I would like to go over a couple

of facts that I think is necessary in the analysis of

this time alleging that the judge should be the one that

2

would assess punishment, and of course we think that is

3

very significant.

4

assessed 50 years’ confinement, and at the behest of the

5

defendant in this particular case the trial judge also

6

entered specific findings of fact on why the 50 years’

7

sentence was given by the court at the second trial.
Of course, I think from looking at the

8

9

The same judge at cne second trial

specific facts that we are discussing in this case,

10

there’s

11

answered by the Court.

12

two rather general questions that need to be

The first question is, does the due process

13

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment require the

14

presumption of vindictiveness enacted in North Carolina

15

versus Pearce upon r,;trial of a criminal case, or do any

16

of the following three areas that I would like to

17

discuss render the reasonable likelihood of

18

vindictiveness, as the Court has said, de minimis.

19

First of all, I think that the most important

20

and the strongest allegation that the state has is the

21

very fact that the defendant in this particular kind of

22

case, pursuant to Texas law, has the absolute right to

23

determine which sentencing authority will have the power

24

tc assess the punishment at the second trial.

25

I think that's extremely important.
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

When

1

you're discussing that particular element of the

2

question, I think it's important to recall Pearce and

3

understand and Pearce basically stands for the

4

proposition that punishment assessed upon retrial cf a

5

criminal case should not be set in a certain amount

6

because of vindictiveness of the sentencing authority

7

toward a defendant for exercising his right to appeal.

3
9

Vindictiveness, as the Court has said, should
have no place in setting punishment upon retrial.

A

10

presumption of vindictiveness in Pearce was established

11

because of the possible chilling effect a retaliatory

12

motive could have upon a defendant's exercise of his

13

legal right to appeal.

14

The presumption of vindictiveness is not

15

required solely because of the possibility cf a greater

16

sentence that may possibly be assessed upon retrial.

17

Neither does the possibility of vindictiveness alone

18

require a presumption of vindictiveness.

19

The presumption of vindictiveness has been

20

held to apply only where there is a reasonable

21

likelihood of vindictiveness, and I think whan the Court

22

looks at Colton, Caffin, Bordenkercher and Goodwin, that

23

that's the interpretation that would new stand

24

concerning the Pearce presumption of vindictiveness.

25

The presumption of vindictiveness was enacted
c

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

by this court tc protect against the chilling effect cf

2

retaliatory motivation in assessing punishment when a

3

defendant has basically exercised his right tr appeal,

4

not the fact that vindictiveness may occur, but for the

5

retaliatory vindictiveness that may occur by a trial

6

judge at a second trial.
When we look at the most common application of"

7

8

Pearce,

I think the validity is still there.

You take a

9

situation where a defendant is tried the first time and

10

a trial judge assesses punishment, and you take the fact

11

that he exercises his right of appeal and that he

12

receives a second trial.
When you consider the fact that if the judge

13
14

assesses punishment greater than what he assessed at the

15

first trial, there's only two reasonable reasons that

16

the Court should consider motivated that increase in

17

sentence.

18

Of cou/se, the fir? t one is obviously that he

19

was retaliating against the defendant for exercising his

20

right of appeal.

21

second trial has brought to light additional evidence

22

that may in fact justify an increase in the punishment.

23

The second option may be that the

Now, the rationale in Pearce and those

24

particular cases is still very valid, and there's a

25

reason for it and it still applies, and that reason is
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that if in fact there was no retaliatory motive, it's

2

not too difficult for the Court to place a list of these

3

reasons upon the record.

4

So, under those facts --

5

QUESTION;

But on these facts, don’t we have

6

to cut back on Pearce somewhat if this judgment is to be

7

re versed ?

8
9

HR. SKERRODi

I think you do, sir, yes.

Specifically in a case like this when the defendant has

10

the option of filing at the second point, the only

11

reason for filing to the judge in the second point,

12

rather than the fact that he may be trying to exercise

13

or protect one cf his constitutional rights, I submit to

14

you is more that he is trying

to seek a windfall.

15

Ke is trying to limit the second court from

16

considering evidence or exercising its discretion for

17

the first time in what may in fact be a fair sentence.

18

Now, when you analyze this very closely, what you see is

19

that the application of Pearce in states like Texas

20

actually results in a chilling effect upon a defendant

21

to go to a jury to have that jury determine punishment.

22

QUESTION;

Did not Pearce leave open the

23

possibility of an increased sentence based on new

24

information?

25

HR. SHERROD;

Yes, sir.

I believe under

1

Wasman that it basically has,

2

interpretations given strictly under Pearce because

3

there is two previsions in there that rather conflict.

4

and also under

I believe Gasman indicates that that has in

5

fact occurred, and that's the second issue that the

G

Court can consider in

7

course that would be whether there was sufficient

8

evidence presented on the record that would justify an

9

increase in sentence based upon Wasman and its

10

this particular case, and of

interpretation of the Pearce doctrine.

11

The second area that I think very important --

12

QUESTION;

13

Of course, in Pearce,

Stewart spoke of events happening after.

14

MR. SHERROD;

15

QUESTION;

16
17

Justice

Yes, sir.

These events, I suppose you

concede, all took place before?
MR. SHERROD;

Every one of the facts that

18

would justify an increase in sentence di - in fact occur

19

prior to the first trial, but I think what's important

20

in this case, and the information that contains in

21

Wasman, and where we need further definition and a

22

little guidance, is whether or not the increase in the

23

word from "conduct" to "events” that was established in

24

Wasman indicates that it's events that come to light at

25

the second trial.
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

I think, whan you look at the rationale in the

2

protections that Pearce is meant to apply tc, you see

3

that there is no reason that the Court or the sentencing

4

authority at the second trial should be automatically

5

limited from assessing what they feel is a fair

6

punishment, and when you look at the application of

7

Pearce, and the application that the State cf Texas --

8

that has resulted in their literal application of

9

Pearce, you see situations like this where the court cf

10

appeals judge says that it's rather unfair that there is

11

no evidence of vindictiveness in this case.

12

Yet,

13

North Carolina

14

interpretation of that, that when a judge assesses the

15

punishment at the second trial that under those facts

16

there is a limit upon the sentence, that it can result

17

in unjust sentencing.

18
19

because we must follow the application of
versus Pearce and

Then, you think that North

Carolinia against Pearce went too far?

QUESTION:

22

MR. SHERROD:

Yes, sir.

In its holding?
Yes, sir, and I believe for two

23

reasons, and we have alleged three.

Of course, the

24

first one is the fact that the defendant has the option

25

of electing who sets punishment.

QUESTIONS

Kay I interrupt you just there for

a moment, please, with a question.

HR. SHERROD*

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

If there were no new information

6

brought out at the second trial,

7

different was the defendant said, well, this time I'll

8

have the judge fix the sentence, would the judge then in

9

your view have been free to impose a higher sentence?
HR. SHERROD:

10

the only thing that was

Under our argument, yes, sir.

11

Because our position would be, Your Honor, that there is

12

nc reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness in this

13

particular situation, again,

14

option of electing which sentencing authority shall

15

assess the punishment, and ilso the very fact that in

16

this case a jury assessed punishment for the first

when the defendant has the

time.

17

The judge for the first time exercised its

18

discretion in sentencing the defendant at the second

trial.
QUESTION:

if I'd been the sentencing authority the first time," as

That was done at the

It was our position at the outset that that

7

did not need to be done under the specific instances

8

that were available under this case.
QUESTION:

9

Is it your view that reading Pearce

10

and Wasman together, the sentencing judge may take into

11

account intervening information which was net available

12

at the time?
MR. SHERROD:

13

Reading your interpreta Lion ,

14

yes, sir.

15

there is a question about whether the conduct that the

16

Court spoke of in that particular case was the conduct

17

of a defendant in pleading guilty.

1C

Reading the dissents in that caso,

I think

In other words, I think some members of this

19

Court feel that the very fact that the defendant pled

20

guilty in Wasman had an effect.

21

there's a question about the actual interpretation of

22

what an event means.

23

QUESTION:

And so, I still think

But you do have to disapprove or

24

not follow certain dicta in Pearce to reach the result

25

you want, don’t you?

(202) 628-9300

MR. SHERRODs

1

2
3

yes, sir.

Yes, certain iicta of Pearce,

I believe that’s correct.
When you real the actual opinion that came

4

down in Pearce and when you analyze the interest -- and

5

really, I think what you’ve got is this.

6

at the cases that have come down, in the four cases I

7

previously discussed, I think what you find is that the

8

Court now is really saying, the mere possibility of an

9

increase in sentence or the mere possibility of

When you look

10

vindictiveness is not in and of itself sufficient reason

11

for the Pearce application.

12

In other words, is there a reasonable

13

likelihood that vindictiveness will occur,

and that is

14

what the Pearce doctrine should still stand for today,

15

and I think the extensio i in the application by the

16

Texas courts has limited a vary important element that

17

we have, and by a strict adoption of the North Carolina

18

versus Pearce presumptirn of vindictiveness, what they

19

do is disallow this very, very important fairness

20

doctrine to both the state with a legitimate concern in

21

exercising discretion in punishment, and also from the

22

defendant, to have his particular case modified to the

23

individual facts of that case and also to the particular

24

defendant, his background and everything that’s brought

25

out in that particular case.
1 2
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

So, I believe it has a great effect.

Again,

2

when you look, at the analysis on it, if there's any

3

chilling effect like the Court talked about in United

4

States versus Jackson, the chilling effect comes from

5

the application of North Carolina versus Pearce.

6

Any defendant in the State of Texas will be

7

chilled to exercise this option, to have a jury assess

8

his punishment.

9

the possibility of going to a jury and receiving a

The reason is because he cannot risk

10

greater amount cf punishment under the doctrine

11

established in Chaffen,

12

defendant's rights it's the chill that arises from the

13

application of North Carolina versus Pearce and the

14

presumption of vindictiveness.

15

QUESTIONS

and if there's any chill to a

Let me interrupt there.

It seems

16

to me that you have argued — it seems to me that

17

defendant would always be exposed to the risk of

18

increased punishment because the jury would be a

19

different sentencing authority from the first jury, and

20

under your view the judge is a different sentencing

21

authority from the first jury, so neither of them would

22

be limited by the sentence.

23

So, if your argument is correct,

24

open season on the na» sentence?

25

MR. SHERROD:

really,

It is, Your Honor, and the
1 3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

it's

reason my argument should stand is because, first of
all, to modify or to adopt North Carolina versus Pearce
has a chilling effect.

You cause a defendant tc elect

to go to a judge that he feels may ba vindictive.
You cause him, because of Chaffin, to file to
gc to a judge.

It's a Catch-22.

That's what it amounts

to, because if there is any -- if there is any chilling
effect -- you dc away with the chilling effect, the
State of Texas does, by statute.
It says, if you are in fear that this judge
will be vindictive in assessing the second punishment,
then you have the power to elect to go to a jury.
he’s not going to go to a jury.

But

He can’t run that risk

under Chaffin versus Stynchcombe.
And,

what I ’

it

saying is that if you free that

up for both the trial court and also for the jury to
assess whatever they feel is a reasonable punishment, at
the first instance whei they have an opportunity to
exercise their discra’ion, that that is more fair than
the situation we have through the actual application of
North Carolina versus Pearce.
The other point that we have in this case is
the fact that the judge in this case actually was the
court that granted the retrial.

Now, I don’t feel that

that’s as important as the first two areas.

I feel that

1 4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 = ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the first two areas are the ones that have more

2

constitutional significance.

3

One thing that I think is extremely important/

4

depending on which one of these theories the Court may

5

decide, may have a mash greater effect on the nation as

6

a whole, limited strictly to the fact that the option

7

and the election lying with the defendant should control

8

and should say that because of that fact. North Carolina

9

versus Pearce,

the arguments will be restricted purely

10

to the State of Texas and states that allow the

11

defendant that particular right.
But, if the Court goes under the second theory

12
13

that we have proposed, and that is that there should be

14

no restriction when a sentencing authority exercises its

15

discretion at the punishment stage for the very first

16

time, it will affect also the federal courts.
I think the argument is valid in each of those

17
18

areas.

19

the effect that retrial would have, and the granting of

20

retrial, by the trial judge that in fact sets punishment

21

the second time, and I don't believe the Court has ever

22

ruled-on this particular authorization.

23

I don't believe the Court has ever written upon

Even though in North Carolina versus Pearce

24

the same judge was involved, that issue was never raised

25

before this Court, and

I think it's extremely important
15

(202) 628-9300

1

to balance the legitimate interest that the state and

2

the defendant have in wide discretion in the sentencing

3

authority, and

4

likelihood of vindictiveness that may occur.

that must be balanced with the reasonable

In summation, under any of these arguments^ I

5

6

don't believe it is necessary for the presumption of

7

vindictiveness to be applied like the courts in Texas

8

have done, and again,

9

following North Carolina versus Pearce literally.

this, I think under the circumstanees that perhaps would

be a valid reason for the Court to assess the punishment

that the State has raised

motion for new trial rather than a direct appeal to a

removes this case from the ambit of Pearce that the

of vindictiveness, the mere fact of filing a motion for
