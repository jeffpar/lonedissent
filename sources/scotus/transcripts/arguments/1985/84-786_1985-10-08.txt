ORAL ARGUMENT OF WAYNE STUART MOSS, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
/•

7

MR. MOSS:
the Court:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This is a criminal case from Maine involving a
Massiah issue of whether the Sixth Amendment right to counsel

10

applied to a post-indictment meeting between Respondent

11

Moulton and his friend, Gary Colson, a co-defendant, on

12

theft charges.

13

The central question here is whether the Massiah/

14

Henry rule should be extended to the facts of this particular

15

case.

16
17

There are two factors here which are important,
distinguishing .this case from Massiah and Henry.

18

First, Moulton himself,

lot the police, created

19

his incriminating situation relative to the pending theft

20

charges.

21

Second, the police here put the body wire on Colson

22

as part of a legitimate investigation into a new crime which

23

was Moulton's plans to murder a key state's witness, Gary

24

Elwell.

25

In light of these two factors, there is no
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

deliberate elicitation here, because, as the Court said

2

in Henry, the police here did not intentionally create the

3

situation inducing Moulton's incriminating statements.

4

I would like to address each of these two factors

5

in turn.

6

created this incriminating situation.

7

all the contacts between himself and Colson, including the

8

meeting in which he incriminated himself.

9

that it was Moulton who did arrange the meeting in which

10

First, as I said, Moulton himself, not the police,
Moulton initiated

Respondent concedes

Moulton incriminated himself.

11

Moreover, Moulton, on his own initiative, put

12

on the agenda for that meeting a complete discussion of

13

their trial strategy and the perjured testimony tnat Moulton

14

wanted them to get.

15

himself created his own incriminating situation is that

16

some of the statements at the meeting were made without

17

any questioning or promoting by the informant Colson at

18

all and other statements that he made in response to Colson's

19

questions, that Colson asked those questions within the

20

role that Moulton had created for him which was to review

21

discovery materials and prepare a perjured defense for trial.

22

Just further evidence that Moulton

Additional evidence that this Moulton/Colson meeting

23

was not a government-created confrontation is that here

24

Colson was the one who initiated contact with the police

25

to complain about threatening telephone calls.
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

This is

1

not a case where the police sought out the informant to

2

investigate pending charges.

3

The second important factor here is that the police

4

placed the body wire on Colson as part of their legitimate

5

investigation into a new crime, Moulton's plans to murder

6

a key state's witness.

7

The suppression hearing justice below in fact

8

found that the police were involved in this legitimate purpose

9

of investigating a new crime and put the body wire on for

10

that purpose and also to protect Colson's safety and not

11

to gather evidence on the pending charges.

12

This finding is entitled to some deference because

3

it was the suppression hearing justice below who heard the

4

testimony firsthand, observed the demeanor of the witnesses

5

and found both the police and the informant Colson to be

6

believable.

7

The Maine Supreme Court found ample evidence to

8

support the justice s finding and Respondent, as I have

9

said, concedes tha\_ there was a legitimate purpose here

20
21

for this investigation into murder.
The police were making every effort here to comply

22

with Massiah while investigating the proposed murder and

23

this is evidenced by the police instructions themselves.

24

Prior to this Moulton/Colson meeting, the police instructed

25

Colson, the informant, to act like himself, converse normally,
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

and avoid trying to draw information out of Moulton.

2

The police consulted with the local District

3

Attorney's office before giving these instructions and the

4

instructions themselves are consistent with Massiah and

5

show a good-faith effort to comply with it.

6

QUESTION:

But, he did ask questions, didn't he?

7

MR. MOSS:

Yes, he did ask questions.

8

QUESTION:

Do you think he elicited comments?

9

MR. MOSS:

No, he did not elicit comments and

10

the reason why he did not elicit comments is because those

11

were statements that either Moulton was going to make anyway

12

or that those questions that Colson asked were questions

13

that Moulton required him to ask m order to develop the

14

perjured testimony that Moulton wanted him to give.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

But your Supreme Judicial Court disagreed

MR. MOSS:

Yes, and the reason that our Maine

with it?

18

Supreme Judicial Court disagreed is because our Maine

19

Supreme Court assumed that simply by putting the body wire

20

on the informant that the state somehow created the

21

incriminating situation.

22

Our Court also used a foreseeability test and

23

that is because it was foreseeable that the defendant and

24

the informant would be having conversations about pending

25

charges and that the defendant would be making incriminating
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

statements in this conversation, that because this was fore­

2

seeable this also violated Massiah and Henry.

3

QUESTION:

If that evidence had been used against

4

Moulton in the trial on his initial charge, would it have

5

been admissible?

6

MR. MOSS:

The evidence of murder?

Yes, it would

7

have been admissible at least insofar as it would have showed

8

any consciousness of guilt.

9

relevant evidence.

It certainly would have been

And, also it would be admissible for

10

Sixth Amendment purposes as well because, at least as regards

11

to the murder, Moulton was planning to commit the murder.

12

There is no right to counsel for new crimes that someone

13

is planning to commit.

14

Therefore, it should be admissible.

Another reason why the murder evidence would be

15

admissible, which also goes to why all this other evidence

16

should be admissible as well, is that there still has to

17

be a government-created confrontation for there to be a

18

Sixth Amendment violation.

19

is that Moulton in this meeting was just continuing a dis­

20

cussion of ideas that he had originated in the telephone

21

conversation which he also initiated leading up to that

22

meeting.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And, the state's position here

If there were incriminating materials,

could it have been used against Colson on his first charge?
MR. MOSS:

Oh, yes, it certainly could have been,

If it was obtained afterward?

MR. MOSS:

Used against Colson?

QUESTION:

Colson, yes.

MR. MOSS:

The informant.

6

QUESTION:

Maybe I have got my parties mixed here.

7

MR. MOSS:

Moulton is the defendant and Colson

8

is the informant,

9

admissible against Colson.

10

And, certainly it would have been

Colson went to the Chief of Police,

Yes.

QUESTION:

And said he was threatened and wanted

didn't he?

some protection among other things.

5

MR. MOSS:

Yes.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Moss, the Supreme Court of Maine

7

found, as I recall, that Colson frequently pressed — I

think that is the term used by the Maine Cc urt — the

9

respondent here to talk about the thefts.

20
21

22
23
24
25

How do we get

around that?
MR. MOSS:

Those questions have to be put back

in the context of this meeting itself.
In respondent's brief at pages seven and eight,
he lists some of those questions and when one takes those
questions and puts them back in context, one can see that

\

1

Moulton created the situation that required Colson to ask

2

him questions.

3

For example, the first question that respondent

4

has there on page seven is, and this is Colson, the informant,

5

asking the question and Caps, who he refers to is Moulton,

6

the defendant —

7

QUESTION:

What page are we on?

8

MR. MOSS:

Page seven of the respondent's brief.

9

It is the red brief.

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. MOSS:

And, Colson asks, "One thing I cannot

12

remember, Caps, just can't remember, I know it was in December,

13

what night did we break into Lothrop Ford?

14

Now, unto itself that question might seem that it is eliciting

15

something that Moulton didn't want to talk about.

16

shortly before that question -— and that question is on

17

page 23, actually appears on page 23 of the transcript of

18

this meeting — on page 22 of that transcript, shortly before

19

that meeting, Moulton said to Colson, "Anyways, we have

20

got to get a

21

stories right now are all messed up."

What date?"

However,

So, what Moulton did there is he put Colson in

23

a situation where Colson had to get the facts straight,

24

they had to get the facts straight between the two of them,

25

just so they would be able to develop their perjured testimony.

1

This is evidenced by the fact that elsewhere in the meeting

2

Moulton accuses Colson, Moulton accuses Colson — He says,

3

"You don't know what to say.

about and what to not lie about."

5

of that when Colson had his initial interview with the police

And, he is accusing Colson

And, there are other situations where Moulton

QUESTION:

If Colson did ask some questions and

he elicited responses, did the state tell him to do that?
MR. MOSS:

No, the state did not tell him to do

15

QUESTION:

Who set up the meeting?

16

MR. MOSS:

Moulton set up the meetings.

QUESTION:

But the state did put a wire on him?

1

MR. MOSS:

Correct.

2

QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, the Superior Court

3

made an express finding that he was to avoid trying to draw

4

information out of Moulton.

5

MR. MOSS:

Yes, that is correct.

6

QUESTION:

Very different from Massiah or Henry.

7

MR. MOSS:

Yes.

8

QUESTION:

The police knew, as I recall, that

9

respondent did have counsel?

10

MR. MOSS:

Yes.

11

QUESTION:

And, of course, he was not notified.

12

He hadn't waived the right to have counsel, had he?

13
14

MR. MOSS:

17
18

I might add though

here that —

15
16

No, he had not.

QUESTION:

He was talking to the state, wasn't

MR. MOSS:

Yes, the defendant was talking to an

he?

agent of the state, yes.

19

QUESTION:

All right.

20

MR. MOSS:

But, there is no problem with that

21

unto itself.

22

progeny, the Court, in fact, said that no constitutional

23

protection would apply simply because the defendant is

24

making statements to an agent of the state as long as there

25

is no interrogation.

In Brewer versus Williams, one of the Massiah

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20

F

ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

What the state is, in fact, contending here is

2

that there was no interrogation.

3

the reason the police put the body wire on Colson was to

4

investigate this proposed murder.

5

I would add as well that

Now, the police had every obligation to investigate

6

that murder because somebody else — As a matter of fact,

7

the key state's witness, his life was at stake.

8

had a responsibility to investigate that.

9

The police

And, what the police were trying to do with Colson

10

was to use him to investigate the murder while simultaneously

11

having him avoid interrogating the defendant regarding the

12

underlying theft charges.

13

On the other hand, Colson was entitled to protect

14

his cover as an informant, therefore, he had to play along

15

with whatever Moulton had arranged for this meeting simply

16

to be able to protect his cover.

17

And, the state's position is that the questions

18

that Colson asked were questions that he was required to

19

ask in order to be able to go along with the defendant's

20

own plans to develop this perjured testimony.

21

I would add as well that some of the incriminating

22

statements — and this is just further evidence that Moulton

23

created his own incriminating situation — that some of

24

these incriminating statements were made without any

25

questioning or prompting by Colson at all.

So, certainly

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

they are not the result of interrogation and they should

2

not be subject to any Massiah challenge.

3

There is another factor here that — Well, the

4

Maine Supreme Court, as I mentioned earlier, they used the

5

test of foreseeability to find a Massiah violation.

6

problem with that test though is — defendants and informants,

7

just by the nature of informants, it is generally going

8

to be foreseeable that defendants and informants when they

9

get together, that the defendant might be making incriminating

10

The

statements.

11

That, however, does not mean that the government

12

has created a confrontation with the defendant.

13

it is the very foreseeability of those statements, that

14

just when a defendant and informant gets together or a

15

defendant and co-defendant gets together to talk abc ut their

16

case that there might be incriminating statements made.

17

In fact,

It is the very foreseeability of that situation

18

which means that, indeed, the government hasn't dore anything

19

to try and elicit those statements.

20

So, although the Maine Supreme Court used this

21

test of foreseeability, the state's position is that it

22

is the very foresseability of those statements that indicates

23

that this was not a government-created confrontation.

24
25

Now, there is the presence of the body wire itself
here.

QUESTION:

Do you think, counsel, that the Maine

2

Supreme Court knew or should have-known-standard is really

3

any different fiora creating a situation likely-to-induce

4

standard in the Henry case?
MR. MOSS:

5

Yes, it is, because the should-have-

6

known aspect of the Maine Court standard seems to get away

7

from the fact of whether the police were actually deliberately

8

going after statements on the theft charges.

9

Amendment standard is that deliberateness.

10

And, the Sixth

The test which the Maine Court applied sounds

11

more like an objective test that would be more akin to

12

Rhode Island versus Innis and the statement that is used

13

for custodial interrogation under Miranda.

14

And, this Court has already said — It said it

15
'1

in a footnote, I believe, in Rhode: Island versus Innis,

16

that when you are talking about Sixth Amendment deliberate

17

elicitation and Fifth Amendment interrogation, they are

18

really two sepaiate concepts, because when you are talking

1

about Fifth Amendment custodial interrogation, you are talking

>'

20

about the pressure that is already put on the defendant

21

that is inherent in a custodial situation.

22

Therefore, anything which the police do which

23

they should have known about that would prompt any statements

24

the police are going to be taxed for.

25

However, in the Sixth Amendment context, we really
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 r ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

are.

We are talking about deliberate actions by the police

2

that actually destroy the adversary aspects of the trial

3

itself, that destroy the right to counsel that is available

4

for trial and that, in fact, reduces the trial itself to

5

a formality.
Sc, in the Sixth Amendment context, we really

6
7

are looking at have the police done anything intentional.

8

And, the state's position is that the combination of the

9

two factors that we have in this case, Moulton himself,

10

not the police, created this incriminating situation.

11

faith investigation of the police shows that the police

12

here did not intentionally create the situation.

QUESTION:

What about the Mealer against Jones

MR. MOSS:

The state's position is —

19

MR. MOSS:

Well, Mealer vr.rsus Jones was incorrectly

20

decided from the state's point of view, because there —

21

Once again the government did not create the confrontation.

22

If I recall the facts of that case correctly, it was actually

the defendant who —

And, that is exactly the facts —

QUESTION:

But, you say that is not enough.

3

MR. MOSS:

Correct.

And, that is exactly the

4

facts that we have here, because in our case the police

also knew and Chief Keating of the Belfast Police Department,

he says that.

discussion about.

He

did something.
MR. MOSS:

15

To investigate the murder and he was

16

obligated to investigate the murder and we have the finding

17

below that that was the purpose of the body wire, to investi­

18

gate the murder.
So, just because the police themselves were aware

19

20

of what was going to happen, that doesn't mean that they

21

have actually created the confrontation.

the confrontation for there to be a Sixth Amendment

I would also add that the presence of the body
wire itself does not unto itself indicate a Sixth Amendment

They were investigating

Now, because of the factors, the two factors that
I have been emphasizing here, this case is distinguishable

10

from Henry.

11

through its contigency arrangement with the informant and

12

through Henry's custody, had created a confrontation with

1 O

Henry and the Court found no evidence that Henry himself

14
15

In Henry, the Court found that the government,

had created his incriminating situation.
Here, however, there is ample evidence that Moulton

16

at every turn created his incriminating situation.

17

Moulton and Colson, Moulton was the moving party throughout

18

this entire relation?.hip.

19

As between

As I have said, some of Moulton's at the meeting

20

were made without any questioning by Colson at all and even

21

those statements that he made in response to Colson's

22

questions, that Colson's questions were simply within the

23

role-playing that Moulton had set up.

We are relying on both of those factors

in this case.

I see.

MR. MOSS:

We are not just relying on one or the

other.

We are relying on the two of them together.

20

QUESTION:

All right.

21

MR. MOSS:

And, the reason for that is because

22

the good-faith investigation itself into the new crime,

23

that is what they used the body wire for, that helps to

24

show that they were not actually eliciting or creating any

25

situation with regard to the old crime.

You refer to the investigation of the

MR. MOSS:

Nc, there were no charges brought on

the new crime.
As I said though, it is a closer case though when

6

there is no bona fide investigation into the new crime.

7

And, I think at that point an important factor to consider

8

is the first factor that we are relying on here and that

9

is that whether the police created an incriminating situation

10

and then other factors would also have to be looked at to

11

determine whether there is a Massiah violation.

12

one other factor would be what type of instructions did

13

the police give the defendant at that point and another

14

factor, which was an important factor in Henry, is did the

15

police give the informant any incentives to deviate from

16

their instructions, because the problem in Henry was that

17

the contingent fee arrangement with the informant, in fact,

18

gave 1 he informant some '.ncentive to deviate from the

19

instructions in Henry which were to avoid questioning Henry,

20

because the contingent fee arrangement was that he would

21

be paid in exchange for any information he gathered.

22

At least

But, that is not this case, because here the police

23

were investigating a new crime and they did not give the

24

defendant any incentives to go ahead and investigate the

25

pending theft charges.

As I said, the body wire was to investigate the

2

new crime.

3

that charges were dropped against Colson — that is the

4

new charge, not the pending theft charge, but rather new

5

charges.

6

in exchange for his cooperation; that is his testimony at

7

the trial.

8

at the trial, in exchange for what he actually saw, what

9

he actually did with Moulton.

Although admittedly there was a deal here in

No new charges would be brought against Colson

That was in exchange for his eye witness testimony

That deal had nothing to

10

do with actually a continuing investigation to gather evidence

11

against Moulton on the pending theft charges.

12

13

The respondent also refers to the fact that Colson
-had not yet been senLenced and that somehow this gave him

14

an incentive to go ahead at this meeting and to ask Colson

15

a lot of question to ingratiate himself with

16

:he police.

I would point out that the record nowhere supports

17

that.

18

There was nothing said that the informant — that the state

19

would recommend a lighter sentence in exchar ge for gathering

20

evidence on the pending charges.

21

There was no sentencing deal here with the informant.

To the extent that the sentencing means anything

22

at all, it means that it gave the informant an incentive

23

to follow the police instructions precisely, which was to

24

be himself and avoid drawing information out of Moulton,

25

and also the open sentencing gave Colson an incentive to

continue to do what the police wanted him to do, which was

2

to investigate the proposed murder.

3

that Colson had.

4

Those were the incentives

So, the state's position here is that, at least

5

for Sixth Amendment purposes, there really was no interrogation

6

and there really was no elicitation; that Moulton's

7

incriminating statements were the product of a situation

8

which he himself had created that should not be charged

9

to the police.

10

Respondent says that the — given the foresee­

11

ability of the defendant's incriminating statements at this

12

meeting, he somehow implies that the state somehow had some

13

duty to protect against the foreseeability of those statements,

14

but that is not the case.

15

against government-created pre-trial confrontations in the

16

absence of counsel.

17

The Sixth Amendment protects

Where the defendant has created the pre-trial

18

confrontation through misplaced confidence in someone who

19

is really working for the state, then the Sixth Amendment

20

does not apply.

21

the defendant from his own inability to keep quiet and that

22

is especially so here where the defendant was planning new

23

crimes to obstruct justice, perjury and murder, for which

there was no right to counsel anyway.

came after the state's agent, Gary Colson, whispered into

Why do you use the term "deliberately

Do you use that as a word of art?

MR. BEARDSLEY:

I use that word because that is

13

the term that is in the Massiah case to determine whether

14

or not the police agent got certain evidence out of the

15

defendant and it clearly applies in this case.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask you a hypothetical extension

on these facts?

And, those fringe benefits

The agent had every reason to elicit these questions.

17

The agent had not performed for the police up to that point.

He had tried these telephone taps and no evidence had come

And, if the state — I think the state has to

7

and a task has to be set up, instructions have to be very

8

definite, because this investigation as to whether it is

9

a new crime or an old crime can get very confusing.

The agent is an arm of the state

That

10

is why the state has to be very clear in instructing their

agent not to do exactly what Gary Colson did in this case.

12

They didn't take that protection.

13

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Beardsley, both the trial

14

court and the Maine Supreme Court agreed that the state

15

had a legitimate purpose in mind in investigating a ne?

16

offense when it wired Mr. Colson for sound.

17

that there is any deterrent effect on the police in excluding

18

Mr. Moulton's statements under those circumstances?

19

the police have a legitimate purpose in wiring Mr. Cf,Ison

20

for sound to investigate for a new offense, what deterrent

getting through the back door from their agent what they

And, where they knew that this would be discussed
they should have been explicit in telling their agent not

The state would like to make a few

5

points here.

6

that Mculton made without any questioning or prompting by

9

First, as to those incriminating statements

created confrontation.

12

As to Moulton's other incriminating statements

13

which he made in response to Colson's questions, there

Colson was role-playing and as Weatherford says he was

And, as the state has already said in its main

He was scared.

He was entitled

still entitled to protect his cover as an informant,

11

especially insofar as the police were using him to investigate

QUESTION:

14

Is there anything in the record as

to how experienced he was as an informant?

15

MR. MOSS:
