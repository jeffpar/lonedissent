Nr. Lauber, I think you

These tax refund actions present two

questions.

The first is;whether the American Bar

Endowment, a charitable affiliate of the AEA, is

11

subjected to unrelated business income tax cn the

12

profits it derives from running a group insurance

13

program for its members.

14

The second question is whether the individual

15

respondents,

16

AEA, are entitled to deduct a portion of their insurance

17

premium as a charitable contribution.

18

AEA members who acquired insurance frcm the

20

21

were regularly carried on, and that those activities

were unrelated to the acccmplishment cf its educational

objectives.

Section 513(c) cf the Cede defines a trade or

3

business as anj activity which is carried on fer the

4

production of income from the sale of goods cr the

performance cf services.

MR. LAUBER;

The "from" test.

they argue.

making doesn't come from the insurance services that its

17

staff of 40 perform during their working day, but

18

rather, all the money comes from charitable

19

fundraising.

20

They argue that all this money they are

Now, that argument in turn is based on their

21

group, gift theory which is the core of their case.

22

group gift theory starts from the premise that the

23

Endowment sells insurance only to ABA members and the

24

dependents of ABA members.

MR. IAUBER;

Well, they would then have a

harder time making their group gift argument because

their case, depends on selling only cr largely to the

14

although they charge fair market, competitive prices for

15

their insurance, they set their prices at a level that

enables them tc make fairly sizeable profits.

17

And they reason that

Now, they argue that their members, acting

18

collectively, have the theoretical power tc deprive them

19

of any profits by forcing the Endowment tc sell

20

insurance at a lower price, at a price that would cnly

21

cover its costs and let them make no profit at all.

22

they argue that all the profit they make comes at the

23

sufferance of their members, and therefore, every dollar

25

it comes from charitable fundraising in the form of a

argument.

It reasoned that

the idea of a group

5

profiting from its own members is almost a ccntradicticn

7

that an enterprise that depends on the consent of its

members for its profits is net a trade or business.

This group gift theory# for which neither the

of all, the group gift idea

13

legislative history of the 1S69 law in which Congress

14

enacted its definition of the term trade cr business.

15

The House and Senate report accompanying that law

16

discussed the group insurance activities of several

17

categories of tax exempt groups, like fraternal

That is# for these

•groups# the prevision cf insurance tc members was a

Both the House and Senate reports refer tc
these greup insurance activities as a business but note
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

that those groups would be immune from tax on their
insurance profits because for them the insurance
business was related to their exempt function.

Fcr

example, the House report wrote the bill excludes
earnings from businesses related to an organization ’s
exempt function, such as an insurance business run by a
fraternal beneficial association for its members.
/

Now, these groups, like the Endowment, sold
insurance only through their members and the dependents
of their members.

Thus, it was true for them as for the

Endowment that the members had the theoretical power to
deprive them cf any profits at all by making a group
gift.

But the Congress nevertheless characterized those

group insurance activities as a business, and this we
think shows that the group gift idea has no place under
Section 513(c).
Secondly, Respondents* group gift theory is
foreclosed by three Courts of Appeals decisions that
Respondent concedes to be correct.

The Courts of

Appeals for the Fourth,. Fifth and Sixth Circuits have
held that another category of tax-exempt group, that is,
a professional association organized under Section
501(c)(6) as a business league, does run a trade or
business when it provides insurance services and
products to its members and their dependents.

15

not fair to assume that if they didn’t have that

condition in the policy, that the "earnings,” whether

In any event, the business leagues involved in

14

these ether cases which Respondent agrees to be correct

15

could also have argued that because they only sold

insurance to their members and the dependents of their

17

members, that their insurance activity was net a trade

or business but was simply a fundraising activity, and

19

that the group was making a group gift to them.

of the Endowment as charitable receipts, not as business

15

The key question, then, is why doesn’t the

16

Endowment do that?

If its members are as generous as

they say, that should not produce a huge decrease in

19

that we think shows that they are not content to rely on

contrary.

6

competitive with other insurance products available on

the market, and the ABA itself did a study that was put

9

into evidence that showed the cost of 20 state Bar plans

As to the individual Respondents, the Claims

prove that he paid more than the fair market value cf

QUESTION;

18

The Claims Court

But Mr. Lauber, is it correct that

19

there is this dramatic difference in the amount of the

20

dividends, something like 40 percent in this program,

21

and in the three cases you cite, there is about 5

22

percent or 2

1/2 percent?

MR. LAUBER;

23

Hell, the amount of the dividend

24

is simply a function of the price that the Endowment

25

charges.

The higher the growth premium they charge, the

QUESTION*

Well, that tends to show they were

paying close tc $200 fcr $10C worth of services, then.
MR. LAUBEBi

But what, that $10C is part of

the price they are charging for the insurance.

They are

/

charging $20C in premiums, and the Claims Court found
the insurance was worth that.
/

Now, the reason the dividends are sc high is
because of the very favorable experience cf Endowment
members for health and illness and premature death.
QUESTION*

Well, the real comparison then fcr

scmecne wanting to save money would have teen to have
the Ear Association organize the same thing tut cn a
noncharitable basis, rather than go to some ether
insurance company.
MR. IAUBER*

Well, if the Endowment — ycu

mean the Endowment would just offer -- not make any
profits.
QUESTION*

If the American Bar Endowment

insurance had not been designed to return any dividends
but just to give lawyers the insurance protection at the
minimum price, that would have been mere favorable than
the;way it was set up.

But other existing programs were

not more favorable.
MR. IAUBER*

That's right.
