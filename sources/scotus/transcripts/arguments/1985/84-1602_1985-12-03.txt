The .Petitioners urge this Court to hold that

4
5

indeed the trial courts are required to apply the clear

6

and convincing standard on a defendant's motion for

7

summary judgment under Rule 56, and therefore we urge

8

this Court to reverse the decision of the Court of

9

Appeals below.
The purpose of Rule 56 has been often stated,

10
11

it is to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in

12

order to determine whether there is a genuine need for

13

trial.

14

evidentiary standard for both motions is the same.

15

agree that there is no genuine need for a trial if it is

16

clear in summary judgment that the trial court would

17

have to grant a directed verdict applying the proper

18

evidentiary standard.

The commentators are in agreement that the

like to discuss each one seriatim.
The first reason given by the Court of Appeals

2
3

was that a trial court should, not engage in a weighing

4

of the evidence on a motion for summary judgment.

5

answer to that reason is that a trial court n*eed net dc

6

that on a motion for summary judgment, and indeed, the

7

trial court performs no different function on that

8

motion than the trial court perforins in evaluating the

9

evidence on a motion for a directed verdict, and since

The

10

it is clear that the trial court must apply the clear

11

and convincing standard on a motion for a directed

12

verdict, there is no reason that it can’t equally apply

13

it on a motion for summary judgment.
QUESTIONi

14

But when a motion for a directed

15

verdict is made, the evidence is a51 in the record, is

it not?

HR. BRANSON;

the reason the Court of Appeals identified as its second

25

reason for not applying the clear and convincing

standard on summary judgment.

The Court of Appeals said

2

that this motion is really at a threshold in the

3

litj„ation.

4

of Appeals said that it would be unfair to make a

5

plaintiff marshal all cf its evidence at that state of

6

the litigation, and indeed would turn, the Court of

7

Appeals said, a motion for summary judgment into a time

8

consuming and expensive process if plaintiffs had to

marshal all of their evidence at that stage.

It’s tha beginning, so to speak.

justification, the principal justification utilized by

25

the Court of Appeals to support its rule, and we believe

And that is the

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it’s fundamentally wrong, both on this record and as a

2

matter of general application.
The thirl reason offered by the Court of

3
4

Appeals to support its view was that it recited the

5

dicta of this Court that state of mind does not readily

6

lend itself to summary disposition in any kind of a

7

case.
Our response to that is threefold.

8

9

First,

this Court has never accepted from Rule 56 any class cf

10

case.

Second, whether or not state of mind or any other

11

evidentiary issue might present itself in a given case

12

does not determine the standard of proof that any

13

plaintiff must meat at any stage of the litigation.

14

Whether the standard is preponderance, both at the

15

summary judgment stage or at the directed verdict stage,

16

the burden of the plaintiff is to produce that

17

sufficient evidence to go beyond that motion, and it

18

doe~ not do to say that, well, there is a type of

19

evidence here that excuses me from my burden, whatever

20

it is, in this kind of a case.

21

Court of Appeals has essentially said, that because

22

state of mind is at issue in public figure libel cases,

23

we must lower the standard that the plaintiff is

24

required to meet on a directed verdict and not require

25

tht standard to be met at summary judgment,

And that’s what the

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(2C2) 628-9300

but that by

1

definition simply ensures that cases will go to trial on

2

which the district court must grant a directed verdict

3

when the plaintiff has completed his case, and ..nat is

4

wasteful use of judicial resources.
QUESTION;

5

What about credibility questions

6

where there’s just a straight conflict between two sets

7

of affidavits on a question of fact?
HR. BRANSON;

8
9

Your Honor, when that happens,

whether it happens at summary judgment or whether a

10

credibility question arises at trial, in the plaintiff's

11

case, the duty of the district court is to draw the

12

inferences in favor of the person opposing the motion,

13

and therefore that result ought to be the same on either

14

motion .

15

QUESTION;

Which meais it goes to trial.

16

HE. BEANSONs

Absolutely, if there is a

17

specific fact in dispute at either state of the

18

proceeding, then -..he plaintiff is entitled to go past

19

those motions and submit the case to the jury f o r a

20

resolution of that fact.

21

QUESTION;

Well, can the libel plaintiff just

22

rely on his complaint to establish a -- he asserts a —

23

some -- he attacks the particular statements and says

24

they are false.

QUESTION*

What did it say?

3

MR. BRANSON*

The Court of Appeals said that

MR. BRANSON*

Ani

secondly, it said that

10

because state of mind is at issue, it’s inappropriate to

11

apply the clear ani convincing standard because

12

otherwise we would have summary judgment granted, is the

13

inference that you draw from the Court of Appeals*

14

reasoning there.

15

QUESTION*

You don’t think th;re are any —

16

any of the statements that the Court of Appeals said

17

should go to trial, that any of them involved real

18

credibility questions?

19

MR. BRANSON;

No, I don't, Y 3ur Honor, and for

20

example, if we taka the issue of Mr. Eringer, and I

21

think it is appropriate to deal with that question —

22

QUESTION*

That’s Allegation 11?

23

MR. ERANSON;

There are six allegations of the

24

nine remaining that are attributable to Mr.

25

the source, one of which is

11.

Eringer as

The Court of Appeals

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20301

(202) 628-9300

1

dealt with Mr. Eringer on two different issues.

One cf

2

them relates to the procedural question that I've

3

already addressed, the threshold issue, and the other

4

dealt with the substantive question of actual malice and

5

the evidence in the record of actual malice.

6

The Court of Appeals said that Mr. Eringer is

7

not in the United States and therefore is not available

8

for deposition, and since the Court of Appeals said that

9

this is a threshold inquiry, we should give the

10

plaintiff an additional opportunity to somehow deal with

11

Hr. Eringer.

12

fundamentally in error.

13

do not stop at the borders of the United States.

14

plaintiffs had wanted to depose Hr. Eringer, there was a

15

procedure to do it, notwithstanding the fact that he is

16

resident in the United Kingdom, and they never suggested

17

to the district court they had any desire to depose Hr.

18

Eringer.

19

Now, of course, we believe that that's
The Federal Rules of Discovery
If the

So the threshold reason for using Mr. Eringer

20

as a reason for denying summary judgment here we don't

21

believe is sufficient.

22

On the merits,

the Court of Appeals used

23

language that makes it clear that their analysis of the

24

Eermant who was the author of this article,

25

who was the source for these six articles, is an
12
AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

and Eringer,

1

analysis based on negligence.

Indeed, the Court of

2

Appeals uses the words "standard of care," and that is

3

the language of negligence.

4

that fr. Bermant did not lock Mr. Eringer in the eye.

5

He couldn't therefore have reliably, reasonably assessed

6

his credibility.

Tie Court of Appeals says

That’s the language of negligence.

And finally, the Court of Appeals said Mr.

7

8

Bermant did not check Mr. Eringer*s sources himself, and

9

a failure to investigate, we have been told time and

10

again by this Court and others, is the language of

11

negligence.
So the Court of Appeals has said that this

12
13

issue must go to a jury because the plaintiffs have put

14

in facts, specific facts, Mr. Bermant did not check his

15

sources, Mr.

16

inference only of negligence, and that’s

17

constitutionally insufficient to sustain the jury’s

Eringer*s sources, that give raise to an

18

ferdict.

19

of actual malice.

20

But it is admissible evidence on the question

And so by adopting the rationale of the Court

21

of Appeals and diminishing the standard that the

22

plaintiff has to meet on summary judgment, the plaintiff

23

now has some evidence that is admissible on the question

24

of actual malice.

25

would have to find on a Bose review, if a judgment was

It’s not sufficient, and

they have evidence of mare negligence.
QUESTION*

5

Mr. Branson, in fraud actions

6

brought in state courts, frequently the burden of proof

7

is said to be by clear and convincing evidence, actions

8

to set aside a will, that sort of thing.
Have there been state court decisions as to

9
10

what standard applies for summary judgment in these

11

cases?

12

HR. BRANSON*

Yes, Ycur Honor, there have, and

13

we readily admit that there are state court decisions

14

from the state supreme courts that disagree with the

15

rule we are stating.

QUESTION;

You say also, don't you, that the

8

Court ought tc consider the statement and the Chief

9

Justice's opinion in Hutchinson v. Proxmire in the light

10
11

of the Rose case?
NR. BRANSON;

We have suggested in our brief,

12

Your Honor, this.

If the footnote in Hutchinson, which

13

of course has been repeated by this Court in Calder,

14

suggests that there is a rule against summary judgment

15

in public figure libel casese,

16

reconsidered in the Bose, light of the Bose

17

determination.

18

reading cf the r”le -- not of the rule, of the dicta

19

announced in the Hutchinson footnote is that it calls

20

for a neutral application of the summary rules, and

21

indeed, they should be neutral.

22

point in two ways.

23

enunciated that dicta in Poller and stated that state of

24

mind does not readily lend itself to summary judgment,

25

many of the lower courts began to state that there was a

rule against summary judgment in antitrust cases where

2

state of mind was at issue.

3

And therefore this Court in National -- First

4

National Bank, of Arizona versus Cities Service, set the

5

record clear and said there is no such rule.

6

of each particular case, the Court said, in Cities

7

Service, must be examined so that we can deterine

whether a trial is needed, and the Court there upheld a

11

no rule against granting summary judgment in the right

case .

13

Now, before the Hutchinson footnote, lower

14

courts had been saying there is a rule favoring summary

15

judgment in public figure libel cases, and \e believe

16

that the Chief Justice in the footnote in Hutchinson

17

simply corrected that view by stating there is no rule,

18

and we believe that what the Court said in

19

Service applies to this kind of a case as \ ell.

20

case must be dealt with on its own facts, and where a

21

libel plaintiff in response to a motion for summary

22

judgment can produce specific facts on which an

Is that right?

NR. BRANSON*

What the Court is permitted --

what the Court is permitted to do under Bose is to
accept a trial court determination that a witness is not
credible and yet notwithstanding that admission, assess
the record and determine whether there is competent
evidence by a clear and convincing standard

of actual

malice because the author in the Eose case was deemed by
that trial court not to have been credible.

And this

Court in Bose said we understand that, and we take that

ME. BRANSON*

3

I agree.

I misspoke.

I

though-'.

4

I was responding to a question, and I must have confused

5

the two.

6

He believe that the Court of Appeals has

7

discussed evidence, we accept that it has discussed

8

evidence, the relationship of Bermant to Eringer, which

9

is evidence in the record from which someone could draw

10

a reasonable inference of negligence, and what the Court

11

of Appeals is saying, that that evidence is sufficient

12

to get the plaintiff to a jury in the hopes that somehow

13

at trial they will somehow add to that evidence and

14

provide clear and convincing evidence cf actual malice.

15

So

I don't mean to say that 1 he only thing at

16

issue here is the credibility of the reporter.

17

Court of Appeals has identified some evidence which

18

would be admissible on the question of actual malice.

19

The question for the trial court in these cases,

20

that happens, is whether in assessing that evidence it

21

believes that it reaches the clear and convincing

22

standard cf constitutional malice, not simply negligence

23

that we have here.

2

to support its ruling?

3

HR . BRANSON i

No,

I don't because the Court of

Appeals uses the language that a reasonable jury could

5

find actual malice on the following facts, and then it

6

discusses Eringer in the manner that we have discussed

him.

8

that it is applying the standard we argue for, the clear

and convincing standard.

They have not, the Court of Appeals has not said

10

that he would have had to — the Court of Appeals would

The fact that the Court of Appeals,

in your view, relied on negligence, is insufficient

has said that this evidence a* negligence could give a

14

that assessment of the evidence, but that is what the

15

Court of Appeals said.

that that is evidence of mere negligence, and under no

standard is evidence of mere negligence ever sufficient

to find constitutional nalice.

of negligence is so overwhelming that it somehow

constitutional malice.

suggesting that there’s enough evidence of negligence in

I think it's clear that the Court said that

ME. LANE*

That’s correct.

3

The reason I» 3r

i

may say, that I believe the

4

clear and convincing standard should net be applied at

5

this level is one can make the analogy which the Court

6

of Appeals did to a criminal case where the standard of

7

probable cause is sufficient to have a person arrested,

8

have him deprived of liberty for days, many days on

9

occasion, and yet at the trial level it is there that

10

the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt comes into

11

play .

12

And sc here, at the -- at this threshold

13

level, absent a full record, absent an opportunity for

14

the plaintiff witnesses to testify and for the trier of

15

fact to judge credibility by seeing the demeanor of the

16

witnesses, prior to that the standard cannot be clear

17

and convincing.

18

QUESTION;

I mus4-

confess I have some, some

19

difficulty understanding that argument because I think,

20

as Justice Rehnquist pointed out earlier, do we not

21

asume for purposes of — or doesn’t the trial judge in

evaluating the motion assume that all of your witnesses

23

MR. LANE;

No, but the trial court did not do

11

that in this case, and the reason the trial court did

12

not do that is because of Mr. Eermant, on behalf of the

13

defendants, came in with a massive self-serving

14

statement which we have seen in libel cases, and

that is

the allegation of I am purs, I am pure of heart.

thereto, when analyzed, reveals that True was the

MR. LANE:

11

That is correct, Your Honor, and I

think that Bose takes that further when Pose says that

13

this can be reviewed, but it must be reviewed after the

14

record has been established, after the record, which is

15

a record of cross examination.

16

tried cases, all of us know that there is a substantial

17

difference between testimony given during a deposition

18

in a lawyer's office, cu-'s of coffee, people smoking

19

cigarettes, the witness being flanked by his attorneys,

20

objections made, instructions not to answer questions,

21

and the crucible of cross examination in front of the

you contend that the cross examination will do something

other than prove that the witness is totally a complete

Say in summary judgment you just say, well,

Are you saying that ycu will

inferences to be taken to favor the nonmoving party,

yes, of course, but they were not taken in this case, as

8

I have stated.

9

QUESTION;

Right,

but you have argued, well,

10

you didn't have an opportunity to cross examine in front

11

of the trier cf fact, and I'm saying, well, if you did

12

have that opportunity you could perhaps prove that the

13

witness is a total liar, but don't you assume that on

On the ocher side, if I night say, we hear

that I have seen enough of the gigantic conglomerates

which are in the business of publishing information

of them that they are not easily chilled, they are often

9

clothed so strongly in their own arrogance that they

But if one is concerned about that and the

chilling effect that one is concerned about is the

massive verdicts, yet, on the other hand, is the First

take the Court of Appeals at its word.

Had they applied

7

the clear and convincing standard, we believe the Court

8

of Appeals would have found for the defendants and have

9

sustained the judgment of the district court.
And therefore I respond next to Hr. Justice

10
11

White's question who suggested that the proper course,

12

should you apply the clear and convincing standard, is

13

to remand to the circuit court for its determination of

14

the record.

15

this Court demonstrates that you have yourself made

16

those determinations in these cases, with one exception,

17

and that exception was Firestone, and that case was

18

remanded for this reason.

19

tried in the courts in Florida on a strict liability

20

theory, and this court held that the negligence theory

21

announced in Gertz had to be applied to that case.

22

Therefore, the plaintiffs had made no record in the

23

trial court on negligence, and it would have been

24

impossible for this Court to assess the record in that

case.
