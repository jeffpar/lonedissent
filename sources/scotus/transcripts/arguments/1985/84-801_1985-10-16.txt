MR. MC ENBOE;

They are courts of equity, but

In the interim, the trustee

If he has no ability to comply with state law or tc

QUESTION:

That's correct, it would.

Eut you think he would be breaching

3

his duties if he used these free assets to clean up the

4

site.

5

MR. KC ENP.OE:

If it is clear that the asset

6

will never be of any value to the state, that the cost

7

of cleanup will exceed the value of the estate, and in a

8

clean state would never generate any benefit for the

10

QUESTION:

Well, what if -- so it means that

11

he -- so it means -- well, suppose the assets available

12

to creditors are plenty to clean up the site, and the

13

site would then be worth something.

14
15

MR. MC ENROEi

Then he would clean up the

16

QUESTION:

He would.

Would you say then that

17

he could use the assets available to creditors, other

18

creditors to clean up the site?

19

MR. MC EKROEs

MR. HERMANN;
QUESTION;

That's right, Your Honor.

And why should the filing of a

bankruptcy change that outcome?
MB. HERMANN;

Well,

the debtor here was

seeking to avail itself of some of the protections of
the Bankruptcy Code which would not otherwise have been
available in a dissolution proceeding.

What we were

arguing for, if I may emphasize this, is simply the
ability of the Bankruptcy Court to deal with the
emergency situation.
As I say, New York would like to be able to
recover cleanup costs.

New York is obviously not able

to step in and clean up every toxic waste site as soon
as someone is prepared

to abandonment.

Eut the most

fundamental state interest that we are trying to assert
here is the ability of the state to go in on an
emergency basis and prevent the situation f runi getting
worse.
We are not saying necessarily that an owner that the trustee operating a toxic waste facility must
ensure a cleanup before that property can be abandoned.
What we are saying is that a court — as a court of
equity,

the Bankruptcy Court should take into consider

the public health and safety and environmental

That’s true, Your Honor

I

think the equities do enter into the consideration that
is before the Bankruptcy Court.

Certainly in a

situation where the trustee has assets that are
miniscule compared, for example, to the costs cf a
cleanup, or where in essence the situation is one of
bleeding the estate dry tit by bit.

The Court should

As I say, we are not saying that the

state is entitled to a total cleanup before the trustee
can abandon the property or the Pankruptcy Court can
take any other action, but wa are sayino these are
factors which the Court should consider and which courts
traditionally do consider in such situations.
QDESTIONs

Do you think the old equity

doctrine of in pari delicto would encourage comes into
play here at all?
MR. HERMANN;

I don’t think in this situation

that we were in pari delicto, because one of the things
that was clear here is that on the record,

this

particular debtor was notorious, was subject to consent
orders in both Sew York and New Jersey fcr violations.
One cf the things that the lenders here certainly failed
to do and hasn’t been pointed out is to note that there
were on

record both in New York and New Jersey cleanup

orders which required Quanta in both cases to clean up

It was only very shortly before these

proceedings took place that these orders were in effect.

part of a lender would be to say what are your

— a very real situation where there were people who had

This

This was a very real

question.

11

One of the interests that the state here is

12

seeking is to prevent the creation of what we regard as

13

a very large loophole in the environmental laws.

14

Certainly we believe that toxic waste dumpers should net

15

be able to manipulate the bankruptcy laws to avoid

16

compliance with them, but I would also point out that

17

while this case has been cast in preemption terms,

And this may be different given

10

For example, if the landlords here were in a position to

11

step in cn the New Jersey site and take care of all the

12

cleanup,

13

put before the Bankruptcy Court, and if the abandonment

14

had been conditioned upon landlords taking over and

cleaning up the site, well, that is something that would

have been acceptable to the state of New Jersey.

What we were seeking tc enforce in the

It seems to me that at least arguably there are two

different issues on the cost.

Could I ask you, why do you think

that the costs of cleanup or of avoiding some public

the unsecured creditor is, his claim should be

subordinated to the administrative expense of cleaning

15

MS. JACOBSON:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

16

The reach of the police power is very great, as this

17

Court has recognized, sometimes so great that even the

18

destruction of property interests are allowed.
