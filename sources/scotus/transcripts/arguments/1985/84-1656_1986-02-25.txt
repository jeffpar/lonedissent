ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN R. GOLD, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. GOLDs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and

12

may it please the Court, this case raises the long

13

history of the desegregation of Local 28 of the sheet

14

metal workers of New York.

15

This process of desegregation began in 1964,

16

and I hope to demonstrate to you that it was essentially

17

completed by 1975 in the sense that at that time all

18

barriers to entrance into the union had been removed,

19

and no acts of discrimination against any minority

20

persons have been proved since that time.

21

Now, since 1975, however, this union has been

22

under the strictest kind of court order involving the

23

strongest measures of affirmative action.

24

included a 29 percent guota, which I want to talk about

25

at some length, because this is clearly a quota case,

Those have

1

this is not a goal case, further race conscious

2

remedies, and

3

total loss of self-government.

Now, when the quota was not achieved by the

4

deadline which was fixed by the District Court, then

5

civil contempt remedies were imposed upon this union,

6

and as a result of the fact that this was deemed to be

7

civil contempt and not criminal contempt, the union was

8

not able or permitted to defend itself by proving that

9

it had net acted wilfully, and that it didn't have any

10

control over the situation.
As a result of this, a strengthened program of

11
12

further quotas was imposed, more race conscious

13

remedies, 100 percent -- a fund to be used

14

for minorities, and which cannot in any way be used to

15

benefit white people at all.

16

to you that the reverse discrimination in this case is

17

beyond all boundaries.

Now, there is one point that I really think

13

must be put on the table in this case.

14

look at this case seem to apply a presumption to it, the

15

presumption that since this union has been in litigation

16

for all these years over matters pertaining to civil

17

rights, the presumption is that they must be bad people,

18

and some of the language which has been used

19

particularly in the amicus briefs goes beyond all facts.

20

Hany people who

One of the words which appears over and over

21

I want to demonstrate to you that

and would go so far if permitted as to literally put up

a sign at the entrance to the office where people could

11

sign up for the apprentice program saying "Blacks only

need apply."

This union has done just the

In what respect?

2

MR. GOLD*

In that to begin with it contained

a quota.

Next —
QUESTION*

When you say the quota, you mean

the 29.3 percent.

6

MR. GOLD*

Well, it was originally 29 percent.

7

QUESTION;

ftnyway,

8

you call it a quota, and

you say that the court called it a quota.

9

MR. GOLD;

Yes, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION*

All right, so that is one.

MR. GOLD*

That is one.

11
12

What

else?
The next is the total

13

loss of control over self-government by virtue of the

14

administrator, and the others are a variety of minor

15

provisions in the order and judgment and the affirmative

16

action program — that is seven paragraphs of them --

17

which direct that preferences be given to minorities in

18

various aspects of hiring.

19

QUESTION*

Do you make any claim that —

20

similar to the claim the United States makes that the

21

remedy was excessive because it gave remedies to people

22

other than victims?

23

MR. GOLD*

Yes, sir.

24

QUESTION;

Was that part of your argument?

MR. GOLD*

That is part of our argument, Your

case, if you telescope it to look for a moment at what

3

is going on now as a result of these enhanced and

4

magnified orders which followed the contempt, here we

5

have a situation now where the last acts of

6

discrimination that anyone has proved or even alleged

7

occurred prior to 1975, and nevertheless as as result cf

8

these orders this union is presently maintaining two

lists of young people who are applying for entrance to

No.

12

believe one is selected by the plaintiffs, that is, by

one by the administrator, who is the judge’s

representative, a special master.

By no means could it possibly do

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - RESUMED

6

MR. GOLD*

7

Before the luncheon recess, Justice Rhite

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

8

asked me why it was that during this period from 1975

9

until the contempt proceeding was filed in April of

10

1982, or it could even ask further until this very day

11

why has this membership guota of 29 parcent not been

12

achieved, and that is an important guestion, and I would

13

like to answer it.

14

Before I do that, I

15

what the present figures are.

16

record that is before you, but they are filed with the

17

Court in New York, the Southern District of New York,

18

and I think that the Court can take notice of them.

19

would like to tell you
These are not in the

The present figures, the total membership is

20

approximately 3,100 members, and the overall membership,

21

which is non-white as that term is defined in this case,

is 15.5 percent.

Mr. Gold, before you --

Gold, is one of the paragraphs to which you called my

attention which sets forth the quota, it says by 1981 it

3

had to be met,

4

passed.

5

specific findings of contempt aqainst you are based on

6

the failure to achieve the quota?

7

and of course obviously that date has

But am I correct that none of the contempt,

MR. GOLDi

Is that right?

Well, that is correct, that the

8

specifications cf contempt which the District Judge

9

found against us and the Court of Appeals affirmed did

10

not contain that.

11

contempt and the supporting affidavits by the attorneys

12

for both the state and the city concentrated upon the

13

failure to achieve the quota.

14

basis of their motion.

15

The notice of motion to hold us in

That was the primary

The court, the District Court instead said he

16

is not finding us in contempt for failing to achieve a

quota, underline not, and said, but he is con vincei

Yes.

7

You say the figure was 15

just now?

MR. GOLDs

Yes, as of January 31 of this

QUESTION;

Again, before you leave it, just so

Now

8

I have it clear in my mind, is there another paragraph

9

that requires that the quota be met by a different

10

deadline other than the —

11

MR. GOLD;

Now there is. Your Honor.

12

QUESTION;

And where is that?

13

MR. GOLD;

That is in a more recent -- in the

14

more recent order whici emerges —
QUESTION;

15

And then my second question is,

16

have you specifically challenged that position of that

17

order?

18

MR. GOLD;

Absolutely.

One of the orders

19

which is on direct appeal to the circuit from which we

20

filed this cart petition is the order which slightly

21

altered the percentage to 29.32 percent, required that

22

that percentage be achieved by August of 1987, and

23

specifically threatened the anion that its very

24

existence would be in jeopardy by fine, by extraordinary

25

fines if they failed to achieve it by that date, and
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that is one of the primary orders which we are

2

contesting here.

3

QUESTION;

Me. Gold, one of the things raised

4

in your brief has to do with the order setting up a

5

special fund --

6

ME. GOLD*

Yes, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION;

-- for use in connection

8

with

the

apprenticeship program.

9

MR. GOLD;

Yes.

10

QUESTION;

Did you challenge the validity cf

11

the fund order under Title 7 in the Court of Appeals?

12

MR. GOLD;

Yes, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION;

And wa find that challenge in the

14
15

record some place?
MR. GOLD;

The specific -- there was a direct

16

appeal taken from that order itself to the Second

17

Circuit, and the Second Circuit specifically dealt with

18

it on that basis.

19

in its majority opinion went into any analysis as to

20

that order being valid under Title 7, but it was clearly

21

what they considered,

22

dissenting opinion, which specifically states in no

23

uncertain terms that it is invalid just on that ground.

24
25

QUESTION;

I don't think that the Second Circuit

and that is evident from the

Now, before lunch,

you were talking

about two lists from which applicants are accepted for

the program.

2

were they?

3

at the 45 percent level.

4

Those lists were not ordered by the Court,
I thought those were voluntarily structured

MB. GOLD*

Well, T hardly think that that is

5

voluntary, Your Honor.

6

quota, with threats of the nature which are involved in

7

this case, and in order to do your best to come as close

8

to trying to comply with that you "voluntarily," I say

9

in quotes, engage in reverse discrimination, I don't

10

When you are living under a

regard that as voluntary.

11

QUESTION*

Well, at least the second circuit

12

said that the defendant had voluntarily set up the 45

13

percent list.

14

KB. GGLDi

The majority opinion said that.

15

Your Honor, and that was their basis for invalidating a

16

specific provision in the newly revised affirmative

17

action plan creating a mandatory one-to-one, one

18

minority, one majority.

19

voluntary .

20
21
22

QUESTION*

But as 1 say, that is hardly

How is the term "non-white" defined

in the order?
MR. GOLD*

Non-white is a person of -- a Negro

23

person or a person with a Spanish surname.

24

did that definition come from?

25

original complaint filed by the Department of Justice in

Now, where

It came from the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

1971, in which they defined that term as such.

2

definition was carried forward in the pretrial order,

3

which led to the District Judge's decisions.

4

been carried on ever since.

Sr. Sherwood.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF 0. PETER SHERWOOD, ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3
4

MR. SHERWOOD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5

please the Court, listening to Mr. Gold this morning and

6

the first part of this afternoon, I was struck by his

7

characterization of the condition of the union that we

8

have hare before us toiay.

9

the District Court nor the Court of Appeals would have

I

would think that neither

10

recognized the union in its supposed compliance as

11

described by Mr. Gold

this morning.

References to the term “egregious conduct"

12
13

comes not so much from the amici or the briefs filed by

14

the respondents but rather is a term used by the lower

15

courts in describing the conduct of this union.
For over two decades the courts have bean

16
17

prodding this reluctant union towards full compliance

18

with local, stats, and federal laws requiring equality

19

of opportunity in employment.

20

today is simply the latest stop along that arduous

21

road.

22

And our appearance here

This afternoon I want to focus on the meaning

23

of Section 706(g) as it relates to the issues that are

24

before the Court, and of course we stand on all of the

25

arguments that we make in our brief.

Initially, I want

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

to state briefly our position regarding Section 706(a).

2

I intend to respond briefly to a few of the points made

3

by Hr. Gold this morning and early this afternoon, and

4

then return to a fuller discussion of Section 706(g).

5

To the extent that the Court determines that

6

it should address the reach of the remedial authority of

7

District Courts under Title 7, it is our position that

8

Section 706(g) itself gives courts broad authority to

9

grant relief that realistically will work to fully

10

remedy the discrimination that it has found.

11

In some cases, ani I suggest that this is one

12

such case, that includes the power to order affirmative

13

race conscious relief which benefits some people who are

14

not the proven vietius of the identified

15

discrimination.

16

prevents the District Court froa ordering such remedies

17

in appropriate cases is at odds with the plain language

18

of the statute itself.

19

Imposition of a per se rule that

As is evident in the decision to the Courts of

20

Appeals that are charged with responsibility for

21

implementing and overseeing implementation of the

22

statute, such a rule would deprive the courts of the

23

needed tools, the tools they need in order to carry out

24

the statute’s essential purpose of rooting out

25

identified discrimination and its effects.
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 E ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

Pe believe, however, that the determination of

1
2

whether or not non-virtim-specific race-con scious

3

remedies should be ordered should be left initially to

4

the discretion of the District Courts.

5

scheme that Congress envisioned when it enacted and

6

amended Title 7.

7

That is the

Of course, that relief should be tailored to

8

cure the effects of the identified discrimination.

9

Considerations that should attend that determination to

10

impose prospective race-conscioas remedies have already

11

been suggested by this Court in Webber and by Justice

12

Powell's opinion in Fullilove •
They include the efficacy of alternative

13
14

remedies, the planned duration of the remedy, the

15

relationship between the percentage of minority workers

16

admitted to membership, and the percentage of minority

17

group members in the relevant libor pool, the

18

availability of waiver provisions if the hiring plan

19

cannot be met, and the effect of that plan on third

20

parties.
Regarding a number of the points that Hr. Gold

21
22

made earlier, I would like to just make a few comments.

23

One, the District Court’s order here does not impose a

24

quota.

25

is one selected by the union.

discrimination that it has practiced.

QUESTIONS

5

NR. SHERWOODs

How about the 29 percent figure?
The

29 percent figure. Justice

6

Rehnquist, is a number which the District Court said you

7

shall move ahead with -- maka regular and substantial

8

progress, and those are the words the court used,

9

towards getting to the 29 percent.

It is a means by

10

which the Court measured how long it would closely

11

supervise this union's progress towards integration.

12

QUESTION!

There was no time requirement --

13

MR. SHERWOOD;

There is a time requirement

14

which has been, incidentally,

reset a few times now.

15

that conditions beyond the

16

control of the union,

17

might require adjustment, and the court has dene so, as

18

I sail, on two occasions.

19

such as conditions in the union,

What the court has required, and it has said

20

sc in several places in the record, is that it wants the

21

union to move ahead and move ahead with dispatch.

journeymen during that period o£ tima, the curb goes way

up.

that time period, and the court, given that kind of

requiring that it move — make regular and substantial

at only one criterion, and that is, must the percentage
