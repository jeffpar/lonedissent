ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. CRAWFORD, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

3

Mr. Crawford, I think you may

MR. CRAWFORD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I filed a reply brief in support of the petition

9

of certiorari for Robert Davidson because I anticipated two

10

questions that this Court might address in the Daniels case.

11

I asked that the cases be set down together.

12

fit to do so.

13

The Court saw

Those two questions were the question of damages

14

which might happen in some non-prison context, damages common

15

to the non-prison context, and the question of whether the

16

immunity was clear.

17

What i..akes the Davidson case a good solution or

Vj

a good vehicle for the Court to solve those questions is that

19

Robert Davidson was injured when prison officials negligently

20

failed to look into his suggestion’ that another prisoner was

21

going to attack him.

22

and injured him seriously, plainly a prison negligent situation

23

not otherwise common.

24
25

The prisoner did, indeed, attack him

It is also clear that in New Jersey there is simply
no liability whatever when — to either a public entity or
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

an official for an injury caused to one prisoner by another.

2

That would also be true, one inmate of a psychiatric institution

3

to another, that sort of situation.

4

Accordingly, although I think that the Daniels case

5

and the argument which you have heard in it solves the problems

6

that face me and that perhaps this argument was unnecessary,

7

I do want to address those issues and some other related issues

8

which make this case a clear case in which the rules which

9

this Court announced, I thought with unquestioned clarity

10

in Parratt versus Taylor and in Palmer versus Hudson, apply

11

here.

12

Indeed, I am intrigued with the theory that somehow

13

losing a hobby kit or stealing a couple of papers from a

14

prisoner's cell plainly implicates tie Fourteenth Amendment.

15

There is a deprivation of property there, but when a prisoner's

16

face is repeatedly gouged with a fork so that the prisoner suffers

17

damages which Judge Brotman thought could be compensated at

18

$2,000 and which I am sure that is minimal compensation, that

19

that is not a deprivation of liberty interest.

20

I am intrigued particularly by Justice Stevens' question

21

as to whether we are talking about substantive or procedural

22

due process.

23

process but in a peculiar sense.

24

because of their circumstance, perhaps have a substantive

25

right to procedural due process that is meaningful.

And, I believe we are talking procedural due
I think that prisoners,

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And,

1

I say that because you work from a situation in which the

2

prisoner has a right, not just from South v. Maryland, but

3

from English and American cases stretching back well before

4

the Constitution and coming forth in cases like Youngberg

5

versus Romeo, where you recognize that people in custody simply

6

are dependent upon their custodians, and because a prisoner

7

at least, probably someone in a sheriff's care or in a

8

psychiatric or institution for the retarded, can't do the

9

things the rest of us do to protect ourselves from attacks

10

11

by other prisoners.
I assume — The first thing I do is I run.

Maybe

12

before I run I went out and I bought insurance tc protect

13

me from various things that might threaten me.

14

it was wise to do so, I might buy a weapon.

15

hire a guard.

16

going to say to me you are one of two prisoners who is going

17

to be put in solitary confinement for fighting.

18

are a lot of things that I do or you do or anyone in this

19

courtroom does to protect against threats of attack from others.

20

They are not open to prisoners.

21

If I felt

I suppose I could

I could certainly fight back and nobody is

So, there

And, for that reason, it is clear that, just as

22

the state must make some kind of a meaningful remedy available

23

for lost hobby kits that come through the mail, that the state

24

certainly must have some sort of a procedure that says when

25

prison authorities are warned that one prisoner is going to
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

attack another prisoner and they forget to do anything about

2

it, the prisoner can look to relief from the court system.

3

Normally what you do, and I think the civilized —

4

That is unfair to New Jersey.

5

states which do not have extreme sovereign immunity doctrines,

6

states which haven't done what New Jersey did, and Judge Gibbons,

7

an opinion that is full of learned language and obscure ideas,

8

says what is peculiar to the New Jersey sovereign immunity

9

statute is that it is introduced with a clause that says you

10
11

What you would do in those

can't give the state a duty to do everything.
Sovereign immunity isn't here because we are going

12

to absolve the state from liability.

13

we actually absolve the state from duties.

14

to me that if the Fourteenth Amendment did nothing else, it

15

gave the state a duty to protect life, liberty, and property

16

and says that a state cannot deprive anyone of those without

17

due process cf law.

18

In New Jersey peculiarly
And, it seems

And, when New Jersey decided to take that duty away,

19

it seems to me they did it in an unconstitutional statute.

20

The Solicitor General makes much of the fact that my client,

21

who was filling out a form — and this Court has seen plenty

22

of the forms that come up through the prison system — filling

23

out the form of complaint when he wanted relief, didn't say

24

he wanted the statute held unconstitutional.

25

he was sati&j._ed with the statute.

So, plainly

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

He said, I have been injured and I want relief which

1

2

I can't get elsewhere, so please give me that relief and whatever

3

other relief is appropriate to me.

4

relief might well have been to strike down the statute.

I suppose appropriate

I did not think it was necessary when I argued this

5

6

case in the Third Circuit and I am the first lawyer that my

7

client got to see.

8

it very clear that you could have that kind of a statute,

9

but you couldn't take away relief from the prisoner who brought

I thought that Parratt versus Taylor made

'

10

a case to redress that deprivation.

11

the case should go back down for a determination as to whether

12

the statute is unconstitutional.

13

way to use the Court's time now when the question framed

14

repeatedly on whether negligence cm give rise to a 1983 action

15

is here and is here under exactly those circumstances which

16

allow it to be decided once and for all.

17

If I have erred, I suppose

That seems to me an inappropriat:

The deprivation question which troubled Justice

18

O'Connor at the beginning of the preceding argument, it seems

19

to me, could come down either way if you were construing

20

language.

21

across the back of my property and the engineer designed it

22

properly and said I am going to have to take the back two

23

acres — I don't have two acres — but assume a large property

24

to go with it — going to have to take the back two acres,

25

the state would compensate me.

I would assume if the state were building a highway

If they, on the other hand,

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

had hired an engineer who said I can save you a lot of money,

2

I will design you a cheaper highway, and he only took one

3

acre off the back of my property, I am compensated for that.

4

Then the fill is put in and, of course, the first rain storm

5

it flows over the additional acre, because he negligently

6

has designed a highway that takes two acres of my property

7

and pretended it was a one-acre piece of property that needed

8

to be taken.

9

That would be a taking and I would go to court and

10

I would get compensation because the property was negligently

11

taken.

12

QUESTION:

There you could argue that the state

13

actor did, in a general sense, intend the taking and meet

14

a general intent requirement.

15

MR. CRAWFORD:

I suppose, Justice O'Connor — I

16

can't say and I wouldn't say that the prison authorities here

17

intended _hat Robert Davidson have his face chopped up with

18

a fork.

19

that if they aren't careful of him in a prison situation,

20

that they have deprived him of rights, because the only way

21

somebody locked up with a bunch of prisoners, many of them

22

violent, can have any liberty at all is if the prison authorities

23

undertake what I think is their clear duty of protection and

24

that is a common law duty that is in state law

25

law, it antidates Swift versus Tyson, it antidates both the

But, I think that their duty toward Davidson says

it is in federal

Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.
And, for that reason, I would say here there is

ment in this case —

This is why I, like Mr. Saltzburg, don't see

You too would limit recovery to the prison

setting I would conclude.
MR. CRAWFORD:

9

I limit it to the prison setting

10

because it seems to me we can find a clear duty here that

11

is much more easily defined than you find in the general driving

on the streets.

of whether private citizens hit by police cars or ambulances

government as to what is going to go on about compensating

ambulance accidents.

certainly don't need one, and you can distinguish it.

How the body politic deals with the question

It works in that whole political

The people who are walking the streets vote,

You don't need a federal court action

I don't think it would foreclose one, but you

21

Yes, Justice Stevens.

22

QUESTION:

May I ask, when you say we have a clear

23

duty here, what is the source of that duty?

24

law or state law, the duty not to be negligent in the —

25

MR. CRAWFORD:

Is it federal

I think it is a federal law duty,

Justice Stevens.

It seems to me

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. CRAWFORD:

It is in the Due Process Clause?
I think the Due Process — That is

4

why I conclude that there is some piece of substance involved

5

here.

6

for the prisoner —

7

QUESTION:

While I think procedure is all that you have to do

So, I guess you would give me the same

8

answer that was given in the previous case, that if a visitor

9

was injured by an inmate by reason of negligent supervision

10

by the guards, the visitor would have no cause of action.

11

Say he injured both the visitor and an inmate, but the inmate

12

would.

13

MR. CRAWFORD:

I see no reason to find a cause of

14

action for the visitor and the case that is before the Court

15

and the question that should be answered is the question of

16

the inmate.

17

of the visitor, I can't argue wirh it, but I don't think the

18

rationale which gives Robert Davidson his right needs to apply

19

to a visitor.

20

Should the Court feel generous to the protection

QUESTION:

Because it is his status as an inmate

21

rather than the fact of immunity that really is the predicate

22

for the federal claim.

23

MR. CRAWFORD:

No, Justice Stevens.

I think —

24

We found this in Hudson.

25

there was in Hudson, or I think special duties to protect

Even where there is intention, as

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

the rights of a prisoner, as there is in the two cases before

2

the Court today, the availability of a due process remedy

3

after the act is sufficient recompense, so the immunity does

4

become crucial to this.

5

These are the random occurrences which really can't

6

be handled by a pre-deprivation remedy.

7

take things without due process in advance.

8
9

Normally you don't

But, all three of the cases, the two cases today
and the —

10

QUESTION:

Immunity is crucial but it is not sufficient

11

because —- I am not sure under the New Jersey statute, but

12

you conceivably could have an immunity statute which would

13

bar a claim by a visitor as well as an inmate and that wouldn't

14

be sufficient to give them a federal claim though, because

15

you need both the —

MR. CRAWFORD:

QUESTION:

The basis for the claim is that the state

has deprived the person of liberty.

And without any remedy for it.

And, would you say that if there is remedy

there never was a deprivation, a constitutional deprivation?

MR. CRAWFORD:

There is a deprivation, but not a

What is prohibited is deprivation without due process.

You

You can

10

take my life, as this Court has held, either under a sentence

11

of death or under certain circumstances where accidental death

12

is caused.

13

and that is what is lacking here.

14

You can do it, but there must be due process,

I think the Court has heard in the previous argument

15

the basic framework of this argument and I won't go on further.

16

I may address some questions at the end of the argument for

17

my opponents.

Otherwise, I will not take further time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. MADELEINE W. MANSIER

20

22
23

General, you may proceed.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MRS. MANSIER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Petitioner here suffered physical injury as a result

24

of a deliberate act by a third party.

25

part argument here in order to assess liability against the

He now makes a two-

12
AL DFRSON RFPORTING mMPANY

i

1
2

state under Section 1983.
He argues first that because Respondents' negligence

3

was in some tort sense law way, causally related to that

4

physical injury; that, therefore, the state has deprived the

5

Petitioner of liberty.

6

The second part of his argument is that that

7

deprivation was without due process simply because the New

8

Jersey state legislature made a decision to immunize negligent

9

conduct for inner-prisoner injury.

10

Respondents urge this Court to reject both parts

11

of that argument.

12

reject only one, either one of those parts, and still affirm

13

the judgment in favor of the Respondents by the Third Circuit,

14

we would urge this Court to send out a clear message that,

15

first of all, negligence does not equal a deprivation within

16

the meaning of the Due Process Clause, and, secondly, even

17

when their is a deprivation because the conduct has been worse

18

than negligent, that there is not a deprival of due process

19

simply because of the existence of an immunity.

20

no such per se rule.

21

While it is necessary for this Court to

There is

I would like to begin with the first of those two

22

issues, namely, the question of whether negligence equals

23

a deprivation.

24
25

Justice O'Connor has a&ked on a couple of occasions
now about this very question; that is it seems to me that
13
AI DFR90NI RFPORTINCt COMPANY

INC

1

behind the question is does deprivation mean simply some kind

2

of causal relationship or does it mean more than that?

3

Respondents would suggest that it means far more than that.

4

We would adopt the definition that was given by Justice Powell

5

in his concurring opinion in Parratt versus Taylor; namely,

6

that deprivation means some kind of an intentional act to

7

deny something to somebody or a deliberate decision to not

8

act to prevent a loss.

9

QUESTION:

Well, Mrs. Mansier, don't you think the

10

majority of the Court rejected that sort of definition of

11

deprivation in the Parratt case?

12

MRS. MANSIER:

Justice Rehnquist, I do not think

13

that the Court rejected it in the specific sense that it was

14

a part of the holding of the case in Parratt versus Taylor.

15

Respondents are well aware that there is language

16

in Parratt versus Taylor to the effect that the alleged loss,

17

though negligently caused, amounted to a deprivation.

18

that language was not crucial to or a fundamental part of

19

the holding in that case.

20

reason.

21

as to whether negligence would support a claim for relief

22

under Section 1983.

23

so, because what the Court saw there was what Taylor had conceded

24

from the outside which was that there was a state remedy.

25

He had simply chosen not to go into state court.

However,

And, Respondents say that for this

The Court in Parratt versus Taylor framed the issue

The answer was no in that case and rightly

There was a state remedy.

1

Nebraska took care of

2

that and as a result of that, even if there had been a

3

deprivation, even if all of the prerequisites for a due process

4

claim had been made, there still would not have been a deprivation

5

without due process and, therefore, no violation of the

6

Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

7

May I ask the same question I guess I

8

asked earlier, but your submission is that negligence can

9

never constitute a deprivation?

10

MRS. MANSIER:

11

QUESTION:

That is —

Supposing the warden negligently executed

12

the wrong defendant and killed him by mistake.

13

not be a deprivation of life?

14

MRS. MANSIER:

15

any execution as a negligent act.

16

mistake.

Justice Stevens, I do not envision

17

QUESTION:

18

Couldn't they make a mistake?

19

Would that

There may have been a

What is wrong with my hypothetical?

MRS. MANSIER:

It is conceivable.

There may be a mistake as, indeed,

20

there was a mistake in Baker versus McCollan, and there this

21

Court found there wasn't even a right in the first instance.

22

QUESTION:

That is right, but they didn't say that —

23

They didn't rely on the reason of negligence not constituting

24

a deprivation.

25

MRS. MANSIER:

That is correct, because they did
15

Al nFRSnN REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

even need to r&ach that point.

2

that there was no right —

3

QUESTION:

What they found instead was

Take that case.

Supposing a sheriff

4

makes out a search warrant and negligently they type in the

5

worng name and search the wrong house.

6

a deprivation of the right to be free of an unreasonable search

7

just because it was negligent instead of deliberate?

8

does that have to do with whether the constitutional right

9

has been violated?

10

MRS. MANSIER:

Would there not be

What

Because here we are dealing with

11

the Due Process Clause and the Due Process Clause has the

12

specific language of the word "deprive."

13

issue before this Court, at least initially, is what does

14

deprive mean.

15

QUESTION:

And, the primary

So, you are not contending that negligence

16

can never give rise to a 1983 action.

17

never give rise to a deprivation of liberty.

18

MRS. MANSIER:

19

QUESTION:

You are just saying

That is —

Well, I suppose your answer in part to

20

the execution question is that there was an intent to execute

21

someone.

It wasn't an unintended consequence of the action.

22

MRS. MANSIER:

23

QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

So, it can be deprivation.

But, in the

24

circumstance that we just heard about of a pillow on the stairs,

25

it was never contemplated or intended that someone would be
16
AI nFRSOIM BFPOPTIKJO TflMP A VV

\r

1

physically injured as a result of placement of a pillow on

2

the stairs.
MRS. MANSIER:

3
4

That is correct.

And, it was never

contemplated here in this case that Davidson would be injured.
And, in further response to your question, Justice

5

6

Stevens, if this Court could go further and declare that even

7

outside the Due Process Clause, even if there were a claim

8

under the First Amendment, a claim under the Fourth Amendment,

9

that nevertheless there could not be a remedy provided by

10

1983 even for negligent conduct, simply because Section 1983

11

is designed to deal with official abuse of power.

12

Eut, what we are saying in this case is that this

13

Court need not go that far if it does not want to.

14

limit its analysis to due process cliims which is the precise

15

claim being made here and then one needs to focus on the language

16

of the Fourteenth Amendment.

17

in it.

18

amounts to a deprivation because it is not this intentional

19

act, it is not deliberately doing something.

20

antithesis of the whole purpose of the Due Process Clause

21

from the outset.

22

to deal with oppression, to deal with situations in which

23

the government would go through the streets and take people

24

off the streets and put them into prison and take away their

25

liberty in that sense.

It can

4

with something far more than simply negligence.

But, the Due Process

the other case argue that if negligence can ever be a deprivation

within the Due Process Clause, it surely can here.

Petitioners

People who go into prison don't

They may not lose all of their rights as we

10

well know, but they don't gain new ones.

11

as this Court said in Hudson versus Palmer, those rights which

12

are consistent and compatible with incarceration.

13

Instead, they retain,

In Hudson, this Court found that the right to privacy

14

within one's cell was not compatible with incarceration.

15

Respondents would urge here that the right being asserted

16

Specifically, they

Respondents say that the right to absolute

Yes, we have a duty to protect.

Yes, we have a

21

duty to exercise some reasonable care and it is only because

we breach that duty that we were found to be negligent.

the breaching of the duty is simply a question as to whether

8

of injuring a fellow inmate, injured either the visitor or

9

the guard.

11

The prisoner may not recover for this kind of
A visitor or a guard could

So, you have put the prisoner in a lesser position

than the others, is that not correct?
MRS. MANSIER:

It is true, Justice Stevens, that

12

the immunity that is the focal point here does deal with injuries

13

caused by one prisoner to another prisoner.

14

d )es also immunize situations in which injury is caused by

15

a:i escaping or an escaped prisoner.

16

New Jersey law

If a visitor comes into the prison and that person

17

is injured by a prisoner, then, yes, it is true that that

18

person would not come within this immunity and, therefore,

19

would have the right to sue under New Jersey law.

20

And, that question of separating out will get to

21

the issue that I would like to deal with in a moment, which

22

is the question of the reasonableness of the immunity and

23

the question of whether immunity automatically and necessarily

24

means that there is no due process.

25

QUESTION:

Have you answered Justice Stevens'

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

question?

2

You are giving him fewer rights than anyone else.
MRS. MANSIER:

We are giving the prisoner fewer

3

rights with reference to injuries caused by other prisoners

4

in the sense that for that plaintiff there is immunity.

5

answer is yes, Justice Blackmun.

6
7

QUESTION:

The

Sort of a penalogical fellow-servant

doctrine.

8

(Laughter)

9

MRS. MANSIER:

That is certainly one way of articulating

10

it.

11

commentary that goes with that statute and I would like to

12

reach thaL.

I think the rationale behind it is set forth in the

13

But, with reference to this question of whether

14

duty goes simply to negligence or goes to something more,

15

since the Petitioner is really saying that he has a right

16

to safety, that is precisely the claim made by the prisoner in

17

Smith versus Wade.

18

Court specifically said that if the prison guard had been

19

simply negligent, that there would not be any cause of action

20

there because of the need to protect prison guards in their

21

day-to-day decisions in running a correctional institution.

22

In that case, the Court found — This

In Smith versus Wade, as it turned out, the conduct

23

of the prison guard was worse than merely negligent.

24

deliberately indifferent.

25

was going to happen.

It was

He knew or should have know what

And, in that instance, this Court

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

recognized the cause of action and rightly so.
Smith versus Wade was analyzed under the Eighth

2
3

Amendment.

This Court ought not to take the very same claim

4

of a right to safety against injury by another prisoner,

5

analyze it under a different constitutional portion as the

6

Due Process Clause and apply some lesser standard as the

7

Petitioner would have them do of mere negligence.

8

not be consistent.

9

The same standard ought to be applied.

That would

It is the same claim, it is the same argument.

So, while Respondents say that negligence can never

10
11

equal deprivation, Respondents say it surely cannot here.

12

The test ought to be at least deliberate indifference.

13

Turning our attention to —

14

QUESTION:

Well, what about — You say negligence

15

never then, is that it, can form the basis?

16

negligence in knowing what the law is, what the governing

17

law is?

18

MRS. MANSIER:

What about a

We are focusing here on negligence

19

not being a deprivation within the meaning of the Due Process

20

Clause?

21

QUESTION:

22

MRS. MANSIER:

23
24
25

Yes.
And, we are talking about a negligent

taking of life, liberty, or property.
QUESTION:

Right.

What if there is a standard of

law -- a standard of conduct imposed by law that says you
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

may not do this or you may or you may not do certain things

2

and some prison guard just doesn't know what the law is and

3

he goes ahead and does it intentionally.

4

MRS. MANSIER:

5

QUESTION:

6

MRS. MANSIER:

If a prison guard acts intentionally —

Yes.
— and as a result of that a prisoner

7

is injured if we are sticking with the kind of case that we

8

have here, then that is an entirely different case and we

9

would say that an intentional act does equal a deprivation.

10

QUESTION:

All right.

11

QUESTION:

How about gross negligence or recklessness?

12

MRS. MANSIER:

Justice O'Connor, we realize that

13

courts have historically found difficulty in dealing with

14

exactly where the lines are between different standards of

15

conduct.

16

negligence, perhaps in part because of the fact that the word

17

"negligence" appears in both.

That is especially true between negligence and gross

18

We would urge this Court to take the position that

19

even gross negligence, assuming one can define that as being

20

some kind of negligence but something worse than the negligence

21

that occurred here, would still not equal a deprivation within

22

the meaning of the Due Process Clause, primarily because we

23

go back to the position that deprivation is some kind of an

24

intentional act, and intentional and negligence are different

25

qualitatively regardless of whether we are talking about simple
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

negligence or gross negligence.
QUESTION:

2

So, just simple negligence, negligently

3

failing to give medical treatment is not — doesn't give a

cause of action?
MRS. MANSIER:

That is an Eighth Amendment case

Well, would you think that it could be

12

any other kind of a case?

13

argue that in the prison context the Eighth Amendment should

14

really govern just like it did in Estelle.

15
16

MRS. MANSIER:

I am surprised that you just don't

Justice White, that is, indeed, what

I would have called here the third argument.

17

QUESTION:

18

MRS. MANSIER:

All right.
That is — But, I am perfectly willing

19

to reach it now and to skip over for the moment again the

20

argument of whether immunity can — automatically means that

21

there is no due process.

22

Petitioners really believe here and have argued

23

from the outset that there is no liberty interest in the first

24

instance.

25

and that were relied on, indeed, by the Third Circuit, which

The cases that are relied on by the Petitioner

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

admittedly found there was a liberty interest, are completely

2

wrong.

but they have nothing to do with this case.

4

versus Wright.

5

government can't hold somebody and punish them.

6

with that, but that is not what happened here.

7

They are inapplicable.

They were rightly decided,
One is Ingraham

That stands for the proposition that the

The second is Youngberg versus Romeo.

We agree

There the

8

Court found that an involuntarily committed person had a liberty

9

interest in safety but that liberty interest was in being

10
11

free from injury 63 times over a two-year period.
But, in both of those cases this Court said if the

12

plaintiff had been a prisoner, then the question would have

13

been whether it was cruel and unusual punishment because that

14

was the issue that was presented and the Court rejected it

15

because the plaintiffs were not prisoners.

16

Here, the plaintiff is a prisoner and Respondents

i7

would urge that the only right to safety they have is a right

18

to be free from cruel and unusual punishment and if it doesn't

19

reach that level, there is no interest in safety that is

20

recognized.

21

Finally, on the issue of the immunities, if this

22

Court were to determine that immunities are always — auto­

23

matically means that there is no due process, you will negate

24

tort immunity, you will call the^ all into question.

2.5

may even call into question the judicially created immunities.
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

You

1

You will deprive states of the right to fashion their own tort

2

laws to the right expressly recognized in Martinez versus

3

California, providing that that statute is rationale, is not

4

arbitrary, and in this case this statute is, indeed, rational.

5

It is, in fact, a portion of the very same statute that was

6

in Martinez.

7

And, in addition to that, the New Jersey courts

8

have — the legislature has indicated that they recognized

9

the practical problems inherent in supervising prisoners and

10

in particular in preventing injuries caused by one prisoner

11

upon another.

12

decision that they have made is that if you are merely negligent,

13

then you will not be liable.

14

They realized the problems in that.

So, the

lowever, there is another provision in the same

15

act that says if your act is willful misconduct, actual crime,

16

actual fraud, actual malice, if it is any of those, no immunity

17

applies.

18

And, basically what New Jersey legislature has done

19

is that we recognize that negligence doesn't equal a deprivation.

20

It is perfectly proper to pass this kind of a statute.

21

if the conduct gets so bad that it is willful misconduct,

22

we will not protect those people, we will not provide them

23

with any immunity.

24
25

But,

So, in conclusion, we urge this Court to affirm
the decision of the Third Circuit, either by finding that
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

there was no liberty interest in the first place because the

2

Eighth Amendment claim was rejected, or if there was a liberty

3

interest, that the negligent conduct here did not amount to

4

a deprivation within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.

5

And, finally, that the Petitioner is also wrong in saying

6

that the existence of the immunity automatically means that

7

there is no due process.

8

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED, ESQ.
AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENTS

12

MR. FRIED:

13

it please the Court:

14

Mr. Solicitor General?

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

If I may, before I enter the details of what we

15

consider to be the defects in Petitioner's claim, may I suggest

16

a more distant perspective on this case?

17

ago, Oliver Wendell Holmes began the commcn law by insisting

18

on a distinction which he said was sc basic that it is part

19

even of our animal nature, the distinction, in his words,

20

between being stumbled over and being kicked.

In this case, Respondent can at most be said to

22

have stumbled.

24

a CuUjc of action.

25

If anyone kicked Petitioner, it was his fellow

The majestic purpose of the Due Process Clause,
26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

we suggest, is trivialized for it was intended to protect

2

against oppression and there is no oppression here where a

3

state officer has at most stumbled whether or not the state

4

offers a complete remedy for the harm which is occasioned

5

by that stumbling.

6

Now, turning to the details, Petitioner claims there

7

is a denial of procedural due process and I think we should

8

try to keep distinct whether the claim is a procedural or

9

a substantive one.

10

Petitioner claimed, or at least so it seemed from

11

the papers, claimed there is a denial of procedural due process

12

because of the existence of the state immunity.

13

If that argument is correct, then every state

14

limitation on liability, every gap in the complete garment

15

of compensation gives rise to a due process violation, including

16

such familiar limitations on liability as automobile guest

17

statutes, no fault statutues.

18

More remarkably still Petitioner's argument would

19

put under a constitutional doubt limitations on liabilities,

20

gaps in liabilities which have been established by this Court

21

itself.

22

which this Court said that there is ground for grave hesitation

23

before allowing a soldier to bring a cause of action against

24

a military superior and denied the claim.

25

And, I think most strikingly of Chapel and Wallace in

And, I think some of the reasoning in Chapel and
27

similar to the balancing of interest which occassioned the

QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, I suppose the Petitioners

8

in these two cases would say to you, well, we are only concerned

9

about the situation in a prison setting.

10

MR. FRIED:

That point was emphasized, particularly

11

in argument, although I must say the Eighth Amendment aspect

12

was not emphasized as the case was litigated so far.

13

We would suggest that the status of Petitioners

14

here as prisoners is constitutionally irrelevant.

rise to a duty of care and a possible claim of negligence.

In this respect, they aie like a pedestrian, also involuntarily

Yes, he did.
And, he didn't have to stand there.
He made no choice.
He didn't have to stand in that street.
No, he did not.
So, isn't that the difference?

The

15

prisoner has to do whatever the guard tells him to do, whenever

16

he tells him to do it, and however he tells him to do it,

17

and that is the difference betwean that and an ordinary citizen

18

getting stuck by an automobile.

19

MR. FRIED:

With respect, Justice Marshall, that

20

difference is important insofar as it creates a duty of care

21

and the duty of care then is the predicate for the negligence

action.

that their Eighth Amendment rights were violated as they were

Well, it took some rather recent cases

to make all that so awfully clear.

Well, it may not have been all that clear

for a long, long time.
MR. FRIED:

14

Yet as clear as it is now it is clear

because oppression comes when there is some deliberate --

some systematic invasion of right which is what we say is

17

missing here.

to th2 extent that the state does not provide a remedy.

the state may fail to provide a remedy —

QUESTION:

17

MR. FRIED:

And,

Yes, they may.
— under circumstances very similar

18

to those in which this Court has said it is appropriate for

19

the federal government to fail to provide a remedy.

20

And, I think, again, the Chapel case is a very good

21

parallel because there there is a similar balancing of the

22

state's needs and the inconvenience of granting a remedy and

23

the Court came out with the conclusion that one ought to

24

hesitate before applying such a remedy.

25

legislature which engaged in that balancing and we suggest

Here, it is the

31

was a reasonable one and, of course, New Jersey leaves a claim

Secondly, a prisoner does not have a right to safety.

QUESTION:

Are you making that a distinction between

the intentional and the negligent act?

I think a negligent act can

of even a careful jailer to protect his prisoner plainly gives

you no relief and Mrs. Mansier's suggestion that you have

a right to safety is simply untrue.

4

You have a right to care.

Third, the distinction between the Eighth Amendment

5

in Smith and Wade and the Fourteenth Amendment here is that

6

in Smith and Wade had there been any amount of state process

7

it wouldn't have helped.

8

to some kind of process when you have a negligent deprivation.

The question is do you have a right

We suggest finally that if immunity is read as the

Solicitor General and Mrs. Mansier would have it read, that

the great promise of Parratt, critized by many as taking away

12

the right to sue directly without turning to state rights,

13

that the promise was that the states would get back to doing

14

the states' business, the federc1 courts would do their business,

15

that promise is taken away if the states can do their business

16

by saying we will pass an immunity statute and then nobody

can help the prisoner.

will not now.
