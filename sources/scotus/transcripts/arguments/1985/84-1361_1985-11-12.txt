Can delay in a

It can be, Justice Rehnquist, but

10

net under these circumstances, and I would point out

11

that the delay on the first appeal before the Court of

12

Appeals was something in the neighborhood of three

13

years, and this entailed briefing an argument before a

14

panel of the Court of Appeals, a divided panel decision,

15

rehearing en banc, a remand to the District Cc irt for

16

further factfinding, and the issuance of a number of

17

opinions that take up more than 50 pages in the appendix

to the petition.

Well, Justice O'Conner, we don't

contend that time on appeal should under all

circumstances be excluded under Barker versus wingo, but

7

QUESTION;

Why doesn't it make sense to just

8

always consider it, because after all, the appellate

9

court is an arm of government just like the trial court,

10
11

and why shouldn't it just go into the factors?
WE. KUHLIK;

The problem. Justice O'Connor, is

12

that time on appeal necessarily is going to be of

13

greater length than is time in the District Court, and

14

it will be more routinely justifiable, and

15

that into the test that the lower courts have developed

16

under Barker, which generally entails a finding of

17

presumptive prejudice after anywhere from six months to

18

a year to a little more than that, you are inevitably

19

going to skew the balance, and that is exactly what

happened here.

Did the government ever do anything

Justice Blackmun, the government

8

filed its appeals on an expedited basis under the Court

of Appeals rules, but I would note that the defendants

did not do anything either while the cases were pending,

and I would think it would be incumbent upon them —

So your answer is in the negative.

HR. KUHLIK;

14

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
What I am trying tc do is to tie

this into Justice O’Connor’s question of isn’t it a

factor to consider in the Barker and Wingo balance?

17

It’s a factor tc be considered properly, and cur main

2

District Court were not, because District Courts usually

rule faster than appellate courts?

4

HR. KUHLIKi

District Courts,

cf course, have

different functions. Justice Rehnquist.

6

typically rule faster, and they are not required tto

formulate binding precedential rules for other cases.

8

think the very institutional functions of the different

courts would suggest that the Court of Appeals would

They do

require a more lengthy period of time.
Koreover, when a defendant files a pretrial

11
12

motion such as the motions in this case, he must be

13

taken to contemplate the amount of time that will be

14

necessary to resolve the motion and to resolve an appeal

this is the kind of claim, this is the kind of problem

2

that is created by the Court of Appeals' balancing of

the factors in this case.

4

I would note in particular that the federal

5

courts have had relatively little experience with the

Speedy Trial Act, and believe that that inexperience is

demonstrated in the Court of

10

Appeals opinion in this

The court purported

to exclude certain amounts

11

of time to excuse it,

12

against no one, but in the end, it simply put all of the

13

appeal time back into the balance, and the amount of

14

time that is typically taken on appeals will, I think,

15

inevitably skew the balance in this fashion toward a

16

finding of a violation.

all the resulting delay.

3

The issue for this Court today as I see it is

4

whether the appellate court should be held immune from

5

the speedy trial clause of the Sixth Amendment.

6

Sixth Amendment provides that any person charged with a

7

crime shall be given a trial without undue delay, and

8

the government urges that this Court hold that appellate

9

delay, no matter how long, no matter in what

The

10

circumstance, is incapable as a matter of law from being

11

undue or unnecessary.
We believe such an unflexible standard is

12

13

incompatible with the test announced by this Court in

14

Barker-Wingo and is irreconcilable with the protections

15

of the ccncerns underlying the speedy trial clause, that

16

a speedy trial be provided to defendant because lack of

17

such a speedy trial will harm him, his defense, and the

8

courts,

and society as well.
The government seems to suggest to this Court

19
20

that the Barker test is incapable of accurately

21

balancing the interests in a case of appellate delay.

22

We disagree.

23

so different from any other type of delay that it cannot

24

be adequately considered under the reasons for delay

QUESTION;

13
14

What was the government's reason,

that they wanted to appeal the suppression?
MR. STERN;

15

They wanted to appeal the

16

suppressed evidence not only as to the three counts, but

17

also as to the two remaining counts.

18

in saying that the counts were not severed, but it was

the government’s duty to come in and sever, not ours t,

QUESTION;

21

They are correct

Well, but maybe if you are

22

demanding a speedy trial on counts that aren't affected

23

by the suppression order, maybe you have a duty to move

24

to set.

25

MR. STERN;

I don’t think so.

I think what we

were looking at was the circumstance where we wanted the

2

case to proceed to trial or any part thereof, and we

3

thought it was the government 's duty because it was

4

their case and their motion to make.
In any event, one thing that permeates the

5

6

government’s brief that really sincerely bothers me is a

7

belief that no defendant ever really wants a speedy

8

trial, and that if he asserts that right, he is

9

basically lying.

10

to your question. Justice O’Connor, is,

11

we made the demand, and it is not the government’s

is no question under this Court’s case law, and as the

government concedes, we would have had the right to a

12

speedy trial applied to us under MacDonald and under

13

that circumstance, because there would have been a "live

14

indictment.”

15

So, to fo ;us on the technicality of the

16

dismissal really punishes these defendants for wanting a

17

speedy trial was that desire for a speedy trial required

18

the government to r raceed and give them that speedy

19

trial, and when they refused,

20

the case was dismissed.

In addition — well, basically, I would like

21

to say at this point that I think that what we have here

22

is a situation where their needs and message come from

23

this Court to both the government and to the appellate

24

courts tc decide more expeditiously through the

25

appellate courts, and if there is not sufficient

2

if there is not sufficient machinery for them to make

3

those expeditious rulings, and parenthetically it may

4

be, because in

5

was understaffed by 13 judges, the Congress should give

6

them that machinery so they can act expeditiously, but

7

in any event, that they should go and recognize that the

8

cases are pretrial, that people and the system suffers

9

when there is nc speedy trial given in that

10

circumstance.
And secondly, I think there needs to be a

11

12

clear message to government that it need not believe a

13

defendant when he says that he wants a speedy trial, but

14

when he says it and they have an opportunity tc give it,

15

and they are ordered to provide it, they had better

provide it.

factors in the same manner.

This is tha first casa we have seen that has

whether they properly counted the time, but you are —

you are sticking with your argument, though, that even

the D.C. Court cf Appeals rule was q lite wrong?

16

ME. KUHLIK:

We io believe it is incorrect,

17

Justice Stevens.

I point out another important aspect

18

of the defendant’s argument seems tc be that the Court

19

of Appeals should as a general matter truly expedite,

20

truly hurry through the pretrial appeals.

21

out that especially under the new Bail Act that

22

defendants in pcst-conviction appeals are going to

23

typically be under far greater prejudicial restraints

24

than are defendants in pretrial appeals such as the ones

25

in this case.

And I point

!*8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC

(202) 628-9300

1

Anci to totally neglect them simply to hurry

2

through on the pretrial appeals I think would be a big

3

«i is take.

4

I would also point out that out of the six

5

years or so that this case was on appeal, one year of

6

that time has tc be attributed solely to the defendants,

7

their completely frivolous rehearing and cert petitions

8

after the second appeal, and indeed, their cert

9

petitions after the first appeal.

At that point, the

10

case was in precisely the same posture it would have

11

been in had the District Court denied their motions to

12

suppress.

13

like the speedy trial claim that is the subject here

Those are claims just
