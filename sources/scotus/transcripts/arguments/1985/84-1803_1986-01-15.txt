The veterans*

preference granted in New York's

Constitution

was uphsli by tnis Court a dozen years ago

9

against an identical challenge, that it impermissibly

10

discriminated against veterans who were not residents of

11

New York at the time they were inducted.

12

called August against Bronstein.

That case was

The Second Circuit felt; that August against

13
14

Bronstain was no longer good law in light of

15

doctrinal developments in this Court, specifically the

16

18

deciiai at the

against Willi an 3 case, and

time.

19

We believe that these recent decisions do not

20

overrule the August, and that New York's classification

21

is reasonably designed to fuLfill legitimate stata

22

purposes.

23

Veteran preference laws have a lone history in

24

this country, and their constitutionality is a vail

25

conditions the award on veterans’ preference credits on

2

residence in the state at the time of induction into the

military .

Fince the 1920 *s New York has promised in its

4
5

Constitution that if a residant goes into the armed

6

services, serves during time of war, and is honorably

i

discharged, that parson on passing a Civil Service

8

examination is entitled to five additional points in

9

competing for public employment.
That commitment, has

10

never been withdrawn, and

11

the commitment can only be withdrawn, we emphasize, by

12

amending the State Constitution.

21

1

York's law rationally does further legitimate state

2

purposes because the Second Circuit viewed the law simrly

3

as a retrospective measure, a reward for past services.

4

It largely ignored the law’s prospective function as an

5

incentive measure, one designed to encourage service in

6

the military, tc encourage persons to return to the State

7

of New York, and to engage ia

But, unlike the New Mexico and Alaska statutes

11

struck down in recent cases of this Court, New York's

Constitution is ind has bean for a long time

14

formal opinion the State’s Attorney General described the

15

law as largely se Lf-executing , and by that he meant that,

16

as part of the State’s Constitution it guaranteed

17

benefits, and the only function of the Legislature was to

18

prescribe the periods of award.

19

New

10

York's statute goes back at least until the Civil War,

11

and I think it's worth observing that the Second Circuit

12

has no .liscussien whatsoever in its opinion of the nature

13

of that history, or of the important fact we rely on here

14

which is that it's a constitutional commitment.

15

The Second Circuit found that New vcrk has no

16

legitimate interest in encouraging its residents to serv*

17

in the military, bat tne Court offered

18

citation for that conclusion in ref erring simply to

19

patriotism, as it described it.

We submit that New York has acted from

for these statutes is fourfold, and two of those purposes

2

therefore it is illegitimate for New York to concentrate

its efforts on its lesser included interest, namely,

THE APPELLANT -- REBUTTAL

MR. HERMANNS

Just cn the retrosp«activity

19

point. New York has, as I ha/e nent, ioned, both a

20

constitutional commitment and a statutory commitment.

21

Part of the reason for having these provisions in both

22

places is that

23

Legislature frequently to define and redefine time of

24

war, but also New York wanted

25

fundamental nature of

of New York would have preferred to define prospectively

5

in 1967 the end of toe Vietnam War, but cf course it was

6

unable to do so, so that built into any such requirement

7

is that -- is the obligation of the State Legislature at

8

certain points in time,

to define that time of war.

What

9

I’m sure the Stale

to define time of war.

New Y g rk did acre, unlike what New Mexico

10

did in hooper against Bernalillo, is frequently during

11

the Vietnam period to define time of war as including the

12

past six months, the past year or whatever,

12

that repeatedly through

14

indeed those freguent

15

show the depth of. New York's commitment to this policy.

and it did

the course of that time, and

amendments to tie New York statute-

to answer Justice Powell’s question about

the Vietnam War and its being an undeclared war, New

18

York’s provision on this tracks very close!y,

19

York statute, the federal provisions which define

20

veterans* benefits in terms of time of war.

21

the relevant federal statute speaks of the Vietnam era,

22

and the President declared several times during the

23

course of the early '70s the end cf the Vietnam era, and

24

for statutory purposes that sufficed under federal

programs.'
