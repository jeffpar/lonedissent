ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT R. APPEL, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. APPEL:

Chief Justice, ana may it

please the Court:

8
9

Mr.

This interesting case raises questions
regarding the proper role of the federal court in

10

reviewing the conduct of an attorney who is faced with a

11

client whom he has good cause to believe is about to

12

commit perjury in a state cou r t criminal trial.

13

nutshell, the Court of Appeals held that admonitions by

14

an attorney violated the right to effective assistance

15

of counsel,

16

law.

17

In a

the right to testify, and due process of

I think the best way I can assist the Court

18

this afternoon first is a rendition of the facts,

19

because there are significant constitutional factual

20

issues raised by the record that the Court should be

21

informed of.

22

merits of this case.

23

25

Secondly,

I'll dive directly into the

The state's position is that where the only
effect of admonition is the exclusion of perjured
testimony at trial it is not a basis for habeas corpus

6

Secondly and consistently with the first
argument,

the state's position is that Strickland v.

Washington provides guidance for analyzing the facts in
this case, and that:

first, the facts reveal no error

of counsel that is outside the wide range of

7

professionally competent assistance;

8

there were such errors, actual prejudice in the sense of

11

Let's take our voyage through the facts.

12

Whiteside and two compan ions in the early morning hours

13

approached Calvin Love's small apartment, where he was

14

sleeping with his girlfriend.

15

the apartment and a heated argument occurred over

16

drugs.

17

They obtained entry to

Love arose from his bed and was stabbed by

18

Calvin -- by the defendant here, Whiteside.

19

of the stabbing, Whiteside fled, disposed of the knife.

20

But before he could make arrangements to flee to

21

Michigan, he was arrested by police.

22

died shortly thereafter at the Cedar Rapids Hospital.

As a result

Well,

the attorneys approached the

Finally, Gary Robinson was appointed by the

16

court to represent Whiteside.

17

what this series of facts show is that Whiteside knew

18

how to complain about attorneys and was not shy about

19

expressing those views to the court.

20

What this fact shows

Robinson immediately began a zealous defense

21

of Whiteside on the charges of murder.

22

before trial, he met with his client 23 times or more,

23

and I think the record demonstrates the very effective

24

character of Robinson's representation.

At the beginning of his representation,
5

(202) 628-9300

he met

1

with Whiteside in his jail cell and was presented with a

2

written piece of paper that purported to describe the

3

character of transactions that led to White's death.

4

And in that written statement the following words

Did you actually see the gun?

And the answer was no,

9

but I thought for sure he had a gun.

It was also

revealed that Whiteside had some assistance in preparing

11

the statement.

12

Consistently throughout the representation,

13

thought that the deceased did have a gun.

3

several minutes after police arrived on the scene,

4

they did not find a gun.

arrived and searched for a weapon and did not find a

gun.

The first was what has been

and

The apartment was then

With that, Robinson was convinced that indeed
there was no gun,

but that the best defense would be

10

that the defendant reasonably thought that Calvin Love

11

while he was in his bed was armed, and that's how the

12

defense proceeded.

13

But about a week before trial, the defendant,

14

in his own words,

15

defense, and in a question and answer period with his

16

attorney he stated that he saw something metalic in

17

Love's hands.

18

"got nervous" about his upcoming

And with that, the two lawyers who were

19

present, Robinson and an associate, Donna Paulson,

20

stopped him and said, where did this metalic item come

21

from?

22

And,

23

"In Howard Cooke's case there was a gun.

24

I saw a gun,

25

in Whiteside's words -- and these are important:
If

I don't say

I'm dead."

With that, his lawyers were shocked and they
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

issued anti-perjury admonitions.

2

admonitions were:

3

that you actually saw a gun to have a defense here; you

4

could present the argument you reasonably believed a gun

5

was present.

6

Specifically, the

number one, it's not necessary to say

The lawyers said they would not allow perjury

7

in the courts of Iowa and that they would seek to

8

withdraw if he insisted upon presenting perjured

9

testimony.

If perjured testimony was presented,

10

Robinson told his client he would advise the court of

11

that fact.

12

And finally -- and this is interesting and

13

I'll quote it completely -- Robinson told his client:

14

"I probably would be allowed to impeach that particular

15

test imony."

16

That's the end of the admonitions.

And with

17

that, Robinson instructed his client to think about it,

18

and in the end Whiteside dropped his assertion that

19

there was something metalic on Love's hands.

20

indeed, the question and answer periods in later

21

meetings continued; and Whiteside appeared at his

22

criminal trial and testified fully about the events of

23

that evening and testified why he thought that indeed

24

Calvin Love had a gun, but under questioning did not say

25

that he actually saw the gun.

QUESTION:

Mr.

Appel,

I take it you take the

2

position that under these circumstances the attorney had

3

a duty to challenge his client's proposed false

4

testimony?

5

6

MR. APPEL:

Well,

I think there's no

question —

7

QUESTION:

What standard do you think should

8

be employed to determine when the facts are sufficient

9

to impose such a professional obligation on the lawyer?

10

MR. APPEL:

Under the Iowa Code of

11

Professional Responsibility, which follows closely the

12

ABA Model Code, a lawyer cannot knowingly used perjured

13

testimony at trial.

14

QUESTION:

And I think it's fair to say —
Does the lawyer have to be

15

convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, or just have a mere

16

suspicion, or what?

17
18

MR. APPEL:

mere suspicion, clearly.

19

20

Well, he must have more than a

QUESTION:

What standard,

then?

What level of

certainty must a lawyer have in your view?

21

MR. APPEL:

I think, once again, a lawyer has

22

to know — and under the Model Penal Code definition,

But let me

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

carry this a step further, because I think I see where

2

you 're heading.

3

A lawyer before he or she issues anti-perjury

4

admonitions probably should know beyond reasonable doubt

5

that his client is preparing to commit perjury.

6

the facts clearly bear that out in this case.

7

Nonetheless —

9

QUESTION:
minute.

I think

Mr. Appel, let me interrupt just a

What is the source of this law that you're

10

talking about, the duty of the lawyer, the standard

11

applied?

12

We have Iowa law before us, and that was the

13

jurisdiction in which this case arose.

14

mentioned the Model Penal Code, and apparently you've

15

given us some of your own ideas.

16

any relevance?

17

MR. APPEL:

You have

Do those really have

I think they do.

They have

18

relevance for the Sixth Amendment question, and the

19

Sixth Amendment question is:

20

assistance of counsel provided here?

21

analyze Sixth Amendment cases I think is presented in

22

Faretta and Herring v. New York.

23

Was somehow ineffective
And the way v/e

In Faretta we learned that the Sixth Amendment

24

constitutionalizes in an adversary trial the right to

25

defend oneself.

And in Herring v. New York, we learned
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that elements of the adversary system that are

2

universally accepted and traditional are incorporated

3

within that Sixth Amendment,

4
5

for instance the right for

summation at the close of evidence even in a non-jury
case .

6

I submit to you that the Sixth Amendment here

7

is not so broad as to cover an extraordinary obligation

8

on the part of a defense attorney to conduct himself in

9

an unethical manner and offer perjured testimony in an

10

upcoming criminal trial at the request of the

11

defendant.

12

That's how it becomes relevant.
QUESTION:

Well, but can't we say that without

13

affirmatively adopting some standard,

14

where, as to what the duties of a lawyer are in this

15

situation?

16

QUESTION:

from heaven knows

Well, hasn't the Bar of the State

17

of

18

conduct of lawyers admitted to practice in their

19

courts?

20

Iowa already declared a standard of the professional

MR. APPEL:

Yes,

it has.

The Iowa rule once

21

again is that a lawyer shall not knowingly used perjured

22

testimony at trial, and that's similar to the historical

23

traditions of the profession.

24

Supreme Court held indeed, that lawyer Robinson acted in

25

the highest traditions of the legal profession.
11

And it's clear, the Iowa

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And it seems to me that because of that long

2

history that's embraced in the Iowa ethical rules,

3

indeed an extraordinary proposition and an extension of

4

the right to counsel beyond what has ever been

5

recognized in any of the cases of this court to suggest

6

that the defendant has a right to the unethical

7

assistance of an attorney simply at his request.

8

it is

This Court has never held that, nor would it

9

qualify under Faretta and Herring as being something

10

that's universally accepted as part of the adversary

11

system.

12

QUESTION:

One of the elements of an

13

inadequate assistance of counsel is there's got to be

14

some prejudice.

15

MR. APPEL:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.
Now,

the argument for the defendant

17

has to be that his being deprived of perjured testimony

18

is prejudice.

19

MR. APPEL:

20

QUESTION:

Right.
I'd say all you have to do is

21

convince us that that isn't so and you win your case,

22

don't you?

23

MR. APPEL:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. APPEL:

think the Court of Appeals erred in applying what

2

amounted to a per se approach.

3

held that under Cuyler v.

5

to demonstrate any prejudice on the facts.

6

that was a misapplication of Cuyler v.

about the truth-finding process, that's a contradiction

in terms.

9

MR. APPEL:

Surely.

It's the ultimate irony,

and that's why the state's first position on the merits

is that where the only impact on the trial process is

basis for reversal.

14

that, even had the lawyer looked at Whiteside and said,

constitutionally defensible.

Well, plainly, under any of the rules of

One final aspect of the record that I think we

do need to discuss about; and it might be a troublesome

one for the state, so let's get it clear right now.

attorneys and the insistence on Thomas Cailor, who had a

another change in attorney are about zero.

Finally he got an attorney, and

Does that mean that the admonitions, when

17

with this trial court ruling, does that mean that indeed

18

the choice for the defendant was to proceed pro se if

Robinson ultimately withdrew?

20

Might be.

But what I want to close with is

that, where a defendant insists on committing perjury at

8

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

13
14

MR. GRADY:

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I think in light of what was discussed here
previously in Mr. Appel's opening statement,

it's

important to emphasize what was the limited holding of
the majority of the Court of Appeals in this case,

and

15

that is, whatever counsel's duties may or may not be

16

when their confronted with a client who insists on

17

testifying to what that attorney believes to be false

18

information, that attorney cannot disclose or threaten

19

to disclose to the fact finder his or her disbelief in

20

the client and the fact that the client is lying.

21

22
23
24
25

And

that's what the attorney threatened to do here.
That's what puts counsel and the defendant at
odds, and that is why the Court of Appeals was correct
in applying the presumptive level of prejudice in this
particular case, because there was a complete

10

I mean, as the case comes to us I take it the Court of

Appeals decided, even if it's perfectly clear and no one

12

would doubt that the client planned to commit perjury,

13

even so the lawyer may not threaten him with anything

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

that's

(202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. GRADY:

Now, why is it different?
The reason for that is that the

3

purpose of the attorney-client privilege as set out in

4

this Court's cases -- for example, Upjohn and Fisher --

5

indicates that for the defendant to be able to give the

6

lawyer the defendant's version of what happened is

7

necessary for the attorney to be able to advise the

8

client, to develop a strategy of the defense, and to

9

actually intelligently exercise the client's option

10

whether or not to take the stand.

11

QUESTION:

Yes, but I am assuming a case in

12

which the client has given his version of what happened

13

and then, having given the version, says, yes, but I'm

14

going to testify differently, and what I testify to will

15

be false.

16

testifying falsely.

I'm assuming an easy case where we know he's

17

Then why is it different?

18

MR. GRADY:

Well, okay.

It's still different

19

from the situation with the witness because having the

20

client -- having the attorney-c1ient privilege remain

21

inviolate and having the attorney still give his guiding

22

hand to the client is part of the traditional

23

adversarial system.

24

or threatening witnesses has ever been recognized as

25

part of the adversarial system in this country or in any

In fact, as was

8

that there is certainly not a constitutional right to

9

MR. GRADY:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GRADY:

Okay.
I'd like to get an answer to it.
Okay.

The answer you can give --

12

and this is the first thing that an attorney must do in

13

that particular situation, and that is an attorney must

14

give the — start out telling the client first basically

15

just the strategic or even moral reasons why it's not

16

proper or advisable to testify to the version the

17

defendant wants to give.

18

For example, he could point to other facets in

19

the record which would contradict the defendant.

20

could point to the fact, again, of a potential perjury

21

prosecution, or again point to the enhanced sentencing.

22

There are plenty of things an attorney might do in that

sit ua tion.

attorney in this case in fact did those things.

defined in Iowa would be for the attorney first to
either encourage or pay someone to actually perjure
himself, as suborning perjury is defined in the Iowa
Code .

MR. GRADY:

What it particularly did -- and

this is why I think the Eighth Circuit's treating it as

a presumptive prejudice issue is appropriate — is the

14

fact that the jury system — to produce a reliable

2

requirement to achieve a fair trial?

3

MR. GRADY:

Well, again, as the so-called

4

conflict of interest analysis goes, what a court simply

5

looks to in that particular situation is the fact that

6

the relationship was changed because of what the

is

I think part of the reason behind that

--

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. GRADY:

Don't you know why he didn't?
Well, certainly he didn't want --

5

I mean, part of the reason the threat worked is he

6

didn't want the trial judge to know of the particular

7

problem.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GRADY:

10

That's right.
In fact,

that's what the attorney

testified to.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GRADY:

That's right.
But regardless of that, you know,

13

I think the point here is that there are certain

14

interests within the adversary system that — this

15

Court,

16

that someone could not be impeached with immunized sworn

17

testimony when that defendant wanted to get up and give

18

te s timony which was different from that.

for example in the Portash case,

19

this Court held

Now, obviou sly the Cou r t was finding in that

20

case that the truth-seeking function was subservient to,

21

for example, one's right against se 1f-incrimination.

22

And I think that's what --

23

QUESTION:

In this case, a s I understand your

24

position,

25

conflict between the lawyer and the client,

really the heart of your argument is there's a
that they

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

have a different -- that the lawyer is not pursuing the

2

client's interests.

3

But what if the lawyer thinks that perjury

4

would be a tactical mistake and more likely to result in

5

conviction than if he told the truth, and therefore

6

everything he did was justified by his interest in

7

acquitting the client?

8

interest there?

9

MR. GRADY:

How do you find a conflict of

Because I think essentially -- and

10

the Curtis court in the Seventh Circuit recognized this

11

-- that the tactical reasons for trying to talk a client

12

out of either testifying or what to testify to is still

13

as decision of the client's himself, because the right

14

to testify or the decision to testify, at least, is

15

personal right of the defendant.

16

QUESTION:

Well, the decision to testify.

But

17

in the fact pattern we have, where he's going to testify

18

ana it's just a question of what he's going to say, and

19

the lawyer sincerely and effectively urges him to tell

20

the truth because he thinks it's going to be more

21

persuasive than introducing a falsehood into the story

22

and maybe looking very bad on the witness stand,

23

wouldn't that be in the client's best interests?

24
25

MR. GRADY:

Certainly that would be.

it gets to the point -47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C 20001

(202) 628-9300

But when

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. GRADY:

Well, where's the conflict?
Well,

the conflict is reached at

3

the point where the client is not,

4

again,

5

that the attorney tried those methods — that the client

6

won't acquiesce.

theoretically — and

in this case we don't have the record to support

7

And at that point,

and the attorney then is

8

going to threaten to violate the attorney-client

9

privilege,

10
11

that's when the conflict arises.

The

conflict wouldn't have arisen until that point if the
attorney was simply trying tactical methods to talk a

12

client out of giving what he believed to be false

13

testimony.

14

And again,

in this particular case the lower

15

courts did not apply a standard which was proper to even

16

make that determination,

17

assumed that in fact this particular client was going to

18

testify falsely based on the fact that simply the good

19

cause standard was supplied or a compelling support

20

standard applied, when really reasonable doubt is the

21

proper standard in the sense that attorney as an

22

advocate must apply at least as high a standard as a

23

jury, who are not partisans,

24

a defendant is lying.

25

QUESTION:

in which the Eighth Circuit

to determine whether or not

Of course,

the Eighth Circuit

48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

i

1

accepted a fact finding against you on that point,

2

didn’t they?

3

MR. GRADY:

That's correct.

Now,

the Eighth

4

Circuit believed that they were precluded by Sumner

5

versus Mada from making a different fact finding, and

6

the case law indicates that they did not have to do that

7

under 2254 because the standards under which an attorney

8

has to make that particular conclusion is really, at the

9

very least, a mixed question of law and fact, because

10

besides just historical fact,

11

again the Canon of Ethics, he has to apply the fact that

12

any doubts must be resolved in favor of the client, and

13

the fact that just someone might give contradictory

14

statements is clearly not enough.

15

16
17

QUESTION:

the attorney has to apply

Well, did you urge that as an

alternative ground for affirmance in your brief?
MR. GRADY:

Yes,

I did.

That was the initial

18

few paragraphs before I treated it as if there was a

19

presumption that in fact there was going to be false

20

testimony there.

21

an improper evidentiary standard was used.

22
23
24
25

And that is the real key here, because

And again,

I think it's important when one

looks at this case, however distasteful of course to
everyone the aspect of a client testifying falsely is,
is the fact that any rule that might come out of this
49
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

case is going to affect how an attorney is going to

2

address his or her client in the initial client

3

interview;

4

that what the client tells the attorney cannot be told

5

to anyone else,

6

to have the benefit of full disclosure,

7

fact, number one,

8

there is some type of false testimony coming up; number

two, being able simply to give the guiding hand of

that if the attorney cannot tell the client

11

QUESTION:

Well,

in your view of this initial

12

interview where the attorney tells the client that he

13

can fully disclose because none of it will ever be

14

repeated, does the attorney have to go ahead and mention

15

the instances which are exceptions to the

16

confidentiality, where there's a threat of committing

17

fraud, where there's a threat of committing a crime?

18

plainly.

23

I think

it's very difficult to just tell a client
fraud or perjury.

You have to

But the fact is is that how an attorney in

24

honesty would have to explain that would deter a client

25

from being absolutely honest, because the client

probably isn't going to know what is and what isn't

2

going to work against him.

3

QUESTION:

So you don't tell the client the

4

actual state of what the law is respecting the

5

confidentiality of the 1awyer-c1ient privilege.

6

give kind of a gloss to it to indicate it's a lot more

7

sweeping than it is?

8

MR. GRADY:

9

You

Well, that I think is current

practice among the defense bar.

Now, if in fact you

10

give exceptions to the attorney-client privilege and try

11

to explain them in the initial interview, that's going

12

to deter the client from giving full information to the

13

attorney.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Grady, it would help me if you

15

would summarize exactly what you think the lawyer should

16

have done in this case.

17

MR. GRADY:

In this particular case, the

18

lawyer under these facts should have first tried to

19

dissuade the client.

20

QUESTION:

He did that.

21

QUESTION:

He succeeded.

22

QUESTION:

He did that..

The lawyer tried to

23

dissuade his client.

What else should he have done?

24

MR. GRADY:

Well, my reading of the record

25

indicate that the client -- that the attorney jumped

straight to the threat to disclose, without going

2

through those other steps ot explaining to the client

3

what exactly would be in store for him in terms of

4

potential perjury prosecution, cross-examination, and

5

enhanced punishment.

QUESTION:

permitted him to go ahead and testify falsely?

9

And should the lawyer have

MR. GRADY:

At that point, I think the

attorney at that point, if all else fails and withdrawal

10

is totally impractical, I think that at that point we

11

have to rely on the adversary system to seek out the

12

truth and that they're going to disbelieve the client

13

and the client's the one that's going to pay the

14

ultimate price.

You think counsel should have

And then,

if he talks him out of it

He can go that far.

I think there's -- well, assuming

I would agree

MR. GRADY

I would say not, again because the

attorney-client privilege would extend beyond that.

QUESTION:

Then isn't he concealing perjury?

MR. GRADY

Well, again, as to the impact of

20

the attorney-client privilege,

exception has to be made .

MR. GRADY:

QUESTION:

because that's

I don't believe so,

QUESTION:

MR. GRADY:

That's correct.

But again, as to

15

how it affects the attorney-client relationship is what

16

makes the difference between those particular cases.

17

QUESTION:

18

the defense rests,

lawyer,

I'm going to testify thus and so, and he

immediately gets up and walks on the stand to testify
falsely?

defense counsel gets up and says,

withdraw from this case.

3

The judge is likely to say:

Why?

I am

unwilling to disclose the reason, but the reason has to

do with the testimony the defendant is about to give.

6

Well,

that tells the judge --

QUESTION:

MR. GRADY:

Right.
-- doesn't it?

In terms of — I don't believe he

can disclose that to the judge.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GRADY:

Could he do that?

In other words --

Well, what has he disclosed?
There's a point,

I suppose, where

13

you have to draw the line as to what he's going to

14

disclose to the judge, what the problem is.

15

what that does is throws the problem in the judge's

lap.

still is problematic.

11

for the lawyer to make, much as any other tactical

representation.
