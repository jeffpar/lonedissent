court's uncontested findings state, carefully documents

Would you say the Court of Appeals

8

said that, even though the substantive result reached

9

was right, there still was a procedural component that

10
11

was separate from that?
MR. GGLDj

Yes, indeed. Justice Rehnguist.

12

The Seventh Circuit said that it needn't get into the

13

substantive issue, that it could assume that the

14

calculation was correct and

15

objector's money would be spent for an impermissible

16

purpose, and nonetheless there would be a constitutional

20

But the Seventh Circuit's position as it

articulated it is that a procedure with the safeguards

are akin to or determined by the objector's right of

And it is our position that that ruling of the

2

Seventh Circuit is erroneous/ that it is contrary to the

3

method of approach this Court stated in Abood versus the

4

Detroit Federation of Teachers in 431 O.S.,

flatly contrary to what the Court had to say in Ellis

arising under the Railway Labor Act.

In determining what due process Is required in

10

11

recognized, the beginning point has to be the nature of

16

And this Court has spoken to the
that right in the Abood

And in Abood — and this was foreshadowed in

17

earlier cases as well — the Court defined the

18

objector’s interest

19

to provide compulsory subsidation of union ideological

20

and political activity not related to collective

21

bargaining.

22

and his right as not

being required

And the Court has at every point phrased its

23

holdings as being that the First Amendment does limit

24

the uses to which the union can put funds obtained from

25

dissenting employees.

That was the phrase used in the

most recent case, in the Ellis case.
And the Court throughout has made it plain

3

that the union shop and the agency shop concepts

4

themselves are constitutional and that, as the Court put.

5

it in one of the earliest cases, that the mere

6

collection of an amount equal to or a proportion of

union dues does not '«fork any unconstitutional

(202) 628-9300

method used here, which is placing it in escrow and then

2

giving the non-member a right to challenge it later?

3

Would it be in your view possibly less burdensome if

4

there were some mechanism for an independent

determination ahead

MR. GOLD;

That approach would be less

QUESTION*

9

MR. GOLD;

I don't believe that it is fair to

10

say that it would be less burdensome on the First

11

Amendment right than the escrow system, because the

12

First Amendment right is the right not to subsidize a

13

First Amendment activity with which one disagrees.

14

There is another aspect to this case, albeit one not

15

treated below, which the Respondents' brief is devoted

16

to, namely a claim that there's a burden on the

17

individual's property right, the right to uncontrolled

18

dominion of the $16 and I think it's 84 cents per month

19

MR. GOLD;

4

I would think that so long as the

5

union on objection holds the money in escrow, both the

6

objector's liberty interests and the objector’s property

7

interests are fairly protected.
Let me say in that regard that we are not

8
9

dealing here with the situation in which

the state says

10

to the union, you can

take from the individual whatever

11

amount strikes you.

12

what the union can seek, both by saying that it cannot

13

be more than the union dues and by setting out a

14

definition of what it is, what type of costs there are

15

that the union can charge the objector for.

The state has placed a limit on

16

In those terms, you have the state limiting in

17

very sharp degree the area that is open to fair dispute,

18

and that area, as the district court pointed out, will

19

continue to narrow once we know more about what the

20

nature of the law is here.

That would seem tc us tc be in the

16

arguments, at least so long as the union's process is

expeditious -- and the district court noted

could not get a de novo determination, at least on the

category questions, namely what categories of union

how do you differ

with what the Court of Appeals held?
MR. GOLD;

10

We differ with the Court of

Appeals

11

in validating this system, which provides every

12

protection that this Court in Ellis said is required.

13

QUESTION;

What did it invalidate?

14

MR. GOLD;

It invalidated a system whereby the

15

union makes this initial calculation and certification

16

and provides escrow,

17

that’s not good enough.
QUESTION;

18
19

a union escrow system.

It said

But didn’t the union just put in

the escrow arrangement after the case started?

20

MR. GOLD;

It did indeed, but --

21

QUESTION:

But did the Court of Appeals

22

invalidate that?

23

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

24

QUESTION;

But it didn't give it much

25

attention?

MR. GOLD;

Well, no, it said it wasn’t -- we

2

don't believe that the escrow system changes our

3

conclusion, it said.

4

insufficient because it was under the union *s control

5

and the union created it.

6

QUESTION;

It said the escrow system was

Put you don’t -- you wouldn't say

7

that -- did you answer Justice Stevens that you think

8

the escrow arrangement is constitutionally required?

9

MR. GOLD;

I answered Justice Stevens by

10

saying that where the union makes a prior calculation

11

that it is our judgment that some cushion has to be

12

provided to take care of the eventualities cf what the

13

union is actually going to do.

14

QUESTION;

Well, that may be so, tut suppose

15

the union purported to establish a cushion.

16

think that there has to be an escrow arrangement to make

17

it constitutional?

18
19
20

MR. GOLD;

No.

Do you

It seems to us that in Ellis

this Court said that there are two different
alternatives.

21

QUESTION;

That’s right.

22

MR. GOLD;

All we’re saying is that we

approach -- this union approached this matter in a

reduction and an escrow.

QUESTION;

1

But as I understand you, maybe I'm

2

wrong, Hr. Gold, but I think you in effect have not

3

challenged the analysis of the Court of Appeals if there

4

were no escrow agreement.

5

or less assumed there must be either an independent

6

decisionmaker or an escrow if the objector's money is to

7

be used pending the determination of how much should be

8

used.
Say we hai

10

It seems to me you have more

no escrow in this case.

Would you

still challenge the Court of Appeals* analysis then?
MB. GOLDf

11

If there were no escrow arrangement

12

and all there was was the union's initial sole

13

determination of the amount due without any background

14

of prior experience or prior decisions, we wouldn't

15

challenge the Court of Appeals* determination.
But this is a first -- I want to emphasize in

answering that this is a first, what I would call and

18

what the district court called a first year case, a case

19

where there isn't prior experience.

20

Kell, I understand that the

practicality, I suppose, is because of the problem of

Well, that's right.

The

2

governmental interests here are that if you

don't -- and

3

the union interests are -- that if you don't get the

4

money month-in, month-out, in the same way you're

5

getting it from members, A,

6

the free rider syndrome, which is what the Government is

seeking to alleviate, continues month-in and month-cut;

and secondly, all the costs of collection are increased

enormously, particularly if the individual leaves cr if

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. VIEIRA*

5
6

Thank ycu, Nr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
I came here and I remain somewhat perplexed in

7

8

attempting to determine for myself what the utility is

9

of viewing this case as a First Amendment case that

10

involves the uses of fees that a union is collecting.

11

We're not dealing at this stage with uses, except in an

12

abstract definitional sense that they are entitled to

13

money only that will be eventually used for collective

14

bargaining.
And no money here has been used because, as

15
16

Justice White suggested a moment ago, during the course

17

of litigation the union introduced an escrow procedure

18

where it segregate! the money? in a separate account.

But I think

Kell, I wasn't responsible for

writing the opinion.

13

QUESTION;

14

ME. VIEIRA:

Sometimes judges talk too much?
Kell, it seems to me this case

15

could have been approached simply by saying , money is

16

being taken fcr legitimate purpose; is the procedure

17

involved in the taking constitutional?
What, does the Seventh Circuit tell us?

18
19

says,

20

taking of this money because the money will be used by a

21

union and therefore it arguably infringes freedom of

22

association to taka it, but that liberty interest is net

23

unconstitutionally infringed, per Abood.

24
25

well,

You can deprive a person of liberty

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

and

1

process of law.

That’s the questions

Is this money

2

that eventually causes a justifiable infringement on

3

freedom of association being taken with due process of

4

law?
And I think the very simple answer -- and

5
6

that's why I’m perplexed —

the very simple answer is

7

there is no constitutional procedure in this case.

8

There's no procedure that meets any standard, it seems

9

tc me,

that this Court has ever suggested is applicable,

10

except in some extraordinary emergency situations, which

11

we do not have here.
QUESTION;

12

Even if -- and I take it then we

13

should just -- you suggest we just analyze it as a

14

property case?
HP. VIEIRA;

15
16

Well, I think you can do that

without ever getting into any -QUESTION;

17

Well, you say the First Amendment

18

issues are all beside the point, so it's a property

19

case .

20

QUESTION;

Well,

then you certainly don't need

21

a neutral decisionmaker to make the decisions if it's

22

just a property case,

23

MR. VIEIRA;

I would think.
Well, I think you need the

24

neutral decisionmaker.

You need the governmental

25

decisionmaker to justify the taking.

It's the

(202) 628-9300

1

Government that's taking his money.
It's the Board of Education that's deducting

2
3

these fees from the salaries of the employees simply on

4

the say-so of the union.

5

is taken, some decisionmaker has to have some type of

6

factual presentation at least at the level of probable

7

cause,

8

that this figure that's being given has some connection

9

with the reality of the collective bargaining activities

10

And I think before that, step

at least at the level of rationality, to suggest

of the union.
Now, in the first

11

year,

I agree with Mr. Gold,

12

it's a more difficult problem because we don't know

13

precisely what the union is doing.

14

case ve don’t know anything about what the union is

15

doing.
QUESTION;

16

Well, Mr.

In fact, in this

Vieira, I have a

17

difficult time understanding hew there could be a due

18

process issue here that's independent of the First

19

Amendment concern.

20

that whatever procedures are required for determining

21

the amount to be withheld are required by the First

22

Amendment itself and not the due process clause.
I really don’t understand your analysis at

23
24
25

And it would certainly seem to me

all.
MB. VIEIRA:

Well, the First Amendment comes

(202) 628-9300

into this, Justice O'Connor, if we look at the use.

2

That is,

3

getting control of the money to expeni that money until

4

we determine that that money will be spent only on First

5

Amendment allowed activity.
We never want the union to obtain control of

7

we obviously want to prevent the union from

any money -QUESTION:

8

That's the whole underlying purpose

9

of the protections in

the scheme that we’re reviewing.

10

So it's a little hard

to separate it out.

11

ME. VIEIRA;

But what I'm saying is I don't

12

think that that question would be relevant to the taking

13

issue.

15

payment that implicated associational interests,

16

17

going to be worried about this collection procedure in

18

any kind of a creditor-debtor framework.

19

That is, if this money were being taken to pay

we'd
We're

There's a secondary problem that not only are

20

we worried about the initial taking, but we're also

21

worried about the transfer to the union.

22

saying in this case is the union has precluded any

23

difficulty with the use question through an escrow, and

24

I think a procedure -- and

25

procedure that the state will have to devise.

New, what I'm

now we're talking about a

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I don't

1

think it's for this Court to tell us what that procedure

2

should be in every permutation and combination.
It’s for the state also to devise a procedure

3
4

whereby the union does not obtain possession, is not

5

allowed to use that money, until there's a final

6

determination that precludes First Amendment

7

violations.
But what I'm getting at here is, at this stage

8
9

of the case we have a procedural due process problem

10

pure and simple because the taking is effective without

11

any submission to any governmental agency of a rational

12

basis that the figura the union gives has some

13

connection with its real collective bargaining costs.
What they do is they take the union dues, an

14

arbitrary figure, no necessary connection with the

collective bargaining there, they subtract what they

should have an injunction against collecting any money?

7

MR. VIEIRA;

Well, I don't think in this case

8

that it's the burden on the employee to have to initiate

9

a court suit.

I think that the procedure that should be

10

followed in broad outline is that the union should be

11

required to come to some agency of the state — not

12

saying it's a court; it could be an administrative

13

agency, a labor board, what have you; we just don’t have

14

a procedure down there in Illinois -- come to some

15

agency of the state with some certifiable facts as to

16

what the collective bargaining costs are.

17

A t that stage, if that agency determines as a

factual matter that there’s a need for these collections
