MR. FREELAND*

QUESTION*

I think it is contrary — yes,

Good.

So you think they should

take the total trust income from trust lands and divide

10

it among the counties in accordance with the number of

11

students or seme other neutral standard?

12

13
14

MR. FREELANDt

I think teat they could do that

as part of the relief that we seek, yes.
QUESTION:;

I know, but I thought you said that

15

it would be contrary to federal law to let the counties

16

in which the land is located have all the money

17

generated for that land.

18

MR. FREELAND*

Not precisely.

What I said was

**•?*

19

that it is contrary tc federal law to allow all of the

20

trust income to go to 59 counties, and at the same time

21

none of it to go to the 23 that we represent.

So you do not attack allocating the

income to the counties in which the land is located.
MR. FREELAND*

13

As a matter of fact, the

14

language of the trust says that that is what is to te —

15

in other words, the land is to be maintained for the

16

benefit of the township in which the land is located,

17

but we have gene beyond that in Mississippi.

QUESTION!

I understand.

19

MR. FREELAND*

20

QUESTION!

That is my point.

Mr. Freeland, I am not sure I

21

understand

the facts.

My understanding was that the

22

counties you represent were owned by an Indian tribe,

23

and when the United States government took that land

24

over and sold it, they gave the proceeds to the State of

25

Mississippi.

The state then invested the proceeds ir. —

All right.

What happened was

First of all, the entire school lands trust was

10

created at one tisa in 1817 in Mississippi's enabling

11

Act and the Land Sales Act.

12

that tha 16 setion lands were to be retained throughout

14

of the lands in what is called the Chickasaw Cession,

15

the 23 counties that we represent, rather than retain

16

the lands in trust, as was supposed to be dene, they

HR. FREELANDs

No, as a matter of fact, if you

10

read the statute, I believe they put about f400,0C0 of

11

it into the railroads, railroads, incidentally, that had

12

no rolling stock, had not been built, and tc add insult

13

to injury, they were in south Mississippi, net in north

Mississippi where our 23 counties are.

15

QUESTIONS

And no suit has been brought

16

against the state in all the years that have passed

17

since then?

18

MR. FREELAND;

19

QUESTIONS

Until this day.

Mr. Freeland, I assume as far as

20

you are concerned that we could take judicial notice cf

21

the natters in the public record such as the annual

22

report of tha sugarintanieit of public aiucation to the

23

state legislature from Mississippi.

24

MR. FREELANDS

Certainly, Justice O'Connor.

certainly hope the Court will do that.

Yes, aside from the 16th Secticn

and the lieu lands revenues.

14

MB. FBEELAND*

15

QUESTION!

That is precisely correct.

What percentage of tha funis per

pupil would you say comes from other funds, local,

17

state, and possibly federal, other than these moneys you

18

are worried about, the lieu lands and 16th Section?

19

MB. FBEELAND*

Mi y I illustrata in dollars?

20

In dollars, in the Chickasaw Cession 63 cents per

21

student, moneys in lieu of trust funis prior to 1985;

22

outside the Chickasaw Cession, $75 per student.

23

Well, my question goes to what

24

other revenues go toward public school education.

MR. FREELAND*

The fund represents outside the

school funds available to the schools in the State of

That is less teachers' salaries.
