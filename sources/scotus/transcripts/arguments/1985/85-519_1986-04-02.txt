The offering memorandum projected losses for
tax purposes ia 1973 through 1975 which ranged from
slightly above £20,000 to £476, and thereafter taxable
income.

Tne taxabLe incom? for the satire period

through 1991 was estimated to be £96,000, and that these
people would be reguired to pay taxes of over £52,000
during that period.
Instead, they got something else.

They got

certain tax deductions which led to lesser tax payments
in the amounts ranging from £29,003 to slightly more
than £38,000 per unit.

The reason that they got greater

tax benefits was because B.

J.

Loftsgaarien, the general

partner, created greater losses, either operating losses
or greater deductions for other items that were
involved, and those were not disclosed, and those were
amounts which benefited him either directly or
indirectly or benefited his affiliates.
There was less income, in addition, because
for example the motel could not operate as it was
anticipated.

Sixty of 159

rooms were not able to be

occupied whenever it rained because Mr. Loftsgarden*s

HR. BRDNIG*

15

First of all, the short answer is

yes.

say, because the standard

under the ‘33 Act is negligence, and say any is required
under the

'34 Act, you can’t get a greater remedy.
iie believe that that analysis is reversed, and

it should go to the express remedy created by Congress
in attempting to determine what Congress intended as the
measure of damages.

Clearly,

the legislative history

says that the person is to get his or her money back, to
recover his or her purchase price.

There is no

suggestion that tax benefits which are created only by
investors’ other income, there are no tax benefits but
for other income.
One of the problems that will be created in
the future will be one that is demonstratei in Freschi
versus Grand Coal Venture.

Bhat happens if the

individual investor determines that the deductions which
are shown on the K-1

do not appear to be appropriate,

and doesn't take the deduction on his or her individual
income tax return?

Is he than to be faced with a

question that he has failed to mitigate his damages by
taking deductions which he believed to be fraudulent?
That will be the issue to arise.

We believe

that Section 28(a) does not impose this kind of
question.

What Section 28(a) does is, it says that you

can’t get identical remedies under state and federal law

But, that is the method that Congress and the

courts have prescribed for applying the Internal Revenue

7

Code to interrelated events that stretch out over mere

9

Court of Appeals in our view, in this case,

The fundamental errer of the
lies in its

10

attempt through strained interpretation of the statutory

11

terms to improve upon the system that Congress has

12

prescribed by creating an unwieldy amalgam of securities

13

law and tax issues to be resolved up front in the fraud

suit.

15

It is a bit like trying to solve an equation

containing too many variables without any firm starting

17

point in ioing that, ani tne ianger of such a

18

contrivance is that it distorts the results ordained by

19

each statutory scheme and thereby undermines the

20

statutory policies of both Acts.

21

The fact that the Eighth Circuit here and the

22

Second Circuit have lisagreel on the details of how to

23

create such an amalgam is, in our view, merely

24

symptomatic of the basic error of undertaking that

25

enterprise in the first place.

2

MR. WALLACE*

By both courts, of undertaking

3

to make an amalgamation of the securities issues and the

4

tax issues in the first place in the fraud suit, rather

5

than applying each statute on its own terms and pursuant

6

to its own processes in a straightforward way, seriatim,

as the tax law provides and as this Court recognized in

11

most egregious misinterpretation of this statute is to

13

a right if the taxpayer has generated other income

14

through his labor or his capital, to get the government

15

to refrain from applying as much tax to that other

But, the tax benefit is not the income itself

and it is not the economic activity that generates

income.

investment made by each of these investors, and they

I won’t rehash the arguments made in the brief

the Court's decision in the Norfolk and ifestern Railway
