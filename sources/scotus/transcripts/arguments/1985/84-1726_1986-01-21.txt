ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. DURKIN, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. DURKIN*
the Court*

All of the circuits that have addressed most of

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the goestions that are here under consideration indicate

10

agreement on certain aspects.

One, all circuits agree

11

that admiralty law is applicable to this type of claim.

12

All of the circuits also iidicate their full agreement

13

that strict liability in torts is applicable in admiralty

14

cases.

15

Four of the five responding circuits had

16

enunciated a rule relative to the damages that are

17

pleadable and collectible in a strict liability and tort

18

claimeu under admiralty.

19

posture.

20

One circuit assumes a different

Before I address specifically the question

21

involved, I would most respectfully invite the Court’s

22

attention to tw o or three, guote, "facts" as set forth in

23

the opinion here under consideration and of the Third

24

Circuit which do not seem to comport with the record upon

25

which those particular findings were made.

And the most

1

grievous, if I may rafer to it as such, is the references

2

in the opinion written by Judge Hunter that the one ship

3

involved, the Bay Ridge, nevac left tile dock.

4

Indulge me for a moment to succinctly outline

5

the differing factors of the first of the threa ships and

6

the Bay Bidge.

7

that was encountered by the Stuyvesant.

8

Stuyvesant encountered that particular problem, there was

9

then under construction at a shipyard in Brooklyn the Bay

10
11

The episoda all started by the problem
St the time the

Ridge.
The shipyard that constructed the four of these

12

supertankers was the same.

13

that were installed in these particular supertankers was

14

also the same.

15

The supplier of the turbines

Now, at the time \.he Stuyvesant experienced its

16

problem, there was a decision made -- The basis for the

17

decision I will review very shortly — that the

18

circumstances required an eiccnange of the ring that was

19

then at the Bay Ridge, and have it transported for

20

installation into the Stuyvesant.

21

Thereafter, as far as the Bay Ridge was

22

concerned, there was manufactured a ring different than

23

the original four rings, wiich newly constructed ring

24

incorporated

the recommendations of these plrintiffs*

25

experts, and

that ring was thereafter installed in that

(202) 628-9300

1

Bay Ridge.

2

It is that plaintiff’s position relative to the

3

Bay Ridge that at the time that Bay Ridge left that

4

shipyard and while it was ;n route to its destination,

5

the problem encountered by that ship had absolutely

6

nothing whatsoever to do with the manufacture of the ring.

7

Hhat happened, at the time that properly

8

constructed ring was being installed in that turbine of

9

the Bay Ridge, some of the appurtenances that had to be

10

installed in order for that turbine to be functional,

11

more specifically a guardian stern bow, was installed in

12

reverse and this installation occurred under the

13

supervision of the representatives of Delaval.

14

As a result of that valve being installed in

15

reverse, improper steam got into that turbine and it was

16

the improper steam that got into that turbine that caused

17

the disintegration of the components of that particular

18

turbine.

19

whan that ring was taken out it was thereafter, it being

20

the first ring, it was thereafter installed in the

21

Stuyvesan t.

22

At the time of the episode with the Bay Ridge,

Now, it may be appropriate now to note that the

23

opinion of the Third Circuit, the Third Circuit made

24

mention on page 7, part of it is carried over to page B

25

of its opinion, that the plaintiff did not seek to order

a new part fro® DaLaval but in lieu of doing that,

2

obtained the ring out of the Bay Ridge.

QUESTION*

Are you asking us to make some

4

factual determinations in this Court that -- don’t we

5

take the facts as we find them in the court of appeals

6

opinion, or not?

7

HR. DURKIN*

Well, on the point that I just

8

mentioned, I thought if the fact would ba a fact

9

obtainable from the record and the specific circumstance,

10

in the court of appeals opinion — the court of appeals

11

expressly states that it’s making its findings on a

12

hypothesis that that ship never left the pier.

13

That ship not only left the pier,

but that ship

14

was in the middle of the ocean when it encountered this

15

difficulty, whan it was in total distress.

16

never a circumstance —

17

QUESTION*

And that was

I don’t know that you — I thought

18

we were just going to deal with the questions you raised

19

in the peti-ion for certiorari.

20

HR. DURSCINs

I a®, sir, but there are two.

21

That one has to do with tha question of the negligence,

22

and the other has to do with the specific circumstance of

23

the applicability of strict liability and tort.

24

what is suggested by the question that’s submitted,

25

factually outlined, is this.
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Now,

1

Kay the manufacturer of a turbine, which

2

turbina is to ba tna power unit of a 225,000 DWT ton

3

tanker, represent to the shipyard that if that

4

manufacturer can supply a turbine to that particular ship

5

so as for that ship to acgaire propulsion, and thereafter

6

when that ship is completed and that ship is sold and

7

that ship is chartered, should that charterer as was the

8

fact here, be responsible without redress to collect in

9

damage approximately two million dollars paid by these

10

plaintiffs to this defendant, Delaval, for that defendant

11

then to do that which that defendant was obligated to at

12

the time of the particular initial constcuction.
Differently stated, the split in the circuits

13
14

seems to suggest, according to the Third Circuit, this

15

plaintiff may not collect this type of damage in strict

16

liability in tort, even though the damages that were

17

caused to this particular charterer are without guestion

18

damages caused by the negligent or improper construction

19

of the turbine at the time of original constructio?..
There has been much suggested in all opinions

20
21

relative to this phrase, "economic loss."

The damages

22

that were sought to be collected here were basically four

23

in nature.

24

directly to Delaval, an amount just the right side of two

25

million dollars, which monies were paid to Delaval to do

One, those monies paid by these plaintiffs

6

measure of damages, what you just talked about?

8

Isn’t that ordinarily a contract

MR. DURKIN;

7

Well, that’s ordinarily a contract

So, sir.

No, sir.

nothing here involving quota contract.
QUESTION*

9

There is

This charterer --

But you just described something in

10

terms of a failure to perforin, I thought, and that is

11

ordinarily a contract concept.
MR. DURKIN*

12

Let me state it again, sir.

That

13

which this plaintiff paid to that manufacturer, the

14

amount I refer to, roughly two million dollars, was for

15

that manufacturer to give to that rnarterer a turbine

16

which that manufacturer, not by means of contract but by

17

operation of law was required to supply in the first

18

place.
QUESTION*

1j
20

You’ve stated it three times but you

haven’t made it any clearer to me.
MR. DURKIN*

21

At the time that the turbine was

22

originally manufactured, extra to any contract term,

23

requirement of that manufacturer was to manufacture a

24

product —

25

QUESTION;

the

Why was it the requirement on the

manufacturer?

2

MR. DURKIN*

3

QUESTION;

Sir,

I’m sorry?

You say there was a requirement on

4

the manufacturer to manufacture in a particular way.

5

What’s the source of that requirement?
MR. DURKIN*

6

Well, the particular turbine was

7

manufactured in New Jersey and the law of new Jersey

8

imposes an obligation upon a manufacturer of a particular

9

commodity, which commodity is thereafter to be introduced

10

into the general course of commerce, a conduct to make

11

that particular turbine reasonably safe.
QUESTION;

12
13

Jersey law in that respect?
MR. DURKIN*

22

Well, then why did you mention New

Jersey law?

Only, sir, because you asked me a

But certainly,

this case was tried

in Admiralty, wasn’t it?

MR. DURKIN*

QUESTION;

25

Well, I won’t say, sir, that they

borrow the New Jersey law.

16
17

So then, the Admiralty borrows New

Yes,

sir.

Well, then if there is a requirerent

on the manufacturer to make the turbine this particular

way, as you say it is, and you say the source of the

2

requirement is from the New Jersey law, A dmiraltymust be

3

oorrowing New Jersey law, isn’t it?

4

MR. DURKIN*

Well, not only New Jersey law.

5

Admiralty has invoked the laws of many land-based

6

authorities on the same question, not solely limited to

7

New Jersey.

8

illustrations of the federal court in exercising

9

admiralty jurisdiction, adopting in certain phases of

New Jersey law comports with many

10

admiralty law, law that’s followed by certain state

11

jurisdictions.
Now, when this plaintiff, this charterer,

12
13

experienced the circumstance that it experienced, if that

14

charterer was required to expend monies, actual dollar

15

expenditures, two million of which went to the defendant

16

for the work that was required to be done by the

17

defendant on

QUESTION*

19

Mr. Durkin, could I interrrupt you.

20

I have sort of the same problem Justice Rehnquist has.

21

Wasn't there a general contractor, in effect, involved?

22

They didn’t deal directly with your client and Delaval,

23

did they?

QUESTION:

4

Your client is the charterer, right?
My client, the charterer -That ordered a ship built by

somebody.
MR. DURKIN*

5

No, sir.

No, sir.

The entity

6

that ordered the ship under contract with the shipyard

7

was an entity totally disassociated from the plaintiff in

8

this case.
QUESTION:

10

How did the plaintiff get Involved,

then?
«

11

MR. DURKIN:

The plaintiff in this case

12

thereafter, after a sequence of transfers of title, my

13

clients chartered, bareboat chartered that vessel from

14

the then owner.

15

during the term of the charter, anything that happens to

16

that ship, I, the charterer, assume the responsibility

17

because I take it in an as-is condition.

When the circumstance occurred Involving the

19

Stuyvesant it was the charterer, not anyone else, who had

20

to attend to the repairs aad —

QUESTION:

So, the two million dollars you're

talking about is repair cost, not original cost?

23

MR. DURKIN:

MR. DURKIN:

Oh, yes, sir.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
Only part of the repair costs that

were encountered by the charterer in getting the work

done.

charterer had to pay more money to the shipyard.

In addition to that two million dollars the

4

QUESTION*

So, you’re saying you’re a

5

subsequent owner of a ship that was defectively

6

constructed and you say, just like I buy a used car that

7

somebody, when they originally built it, built it

8

improperly, I can sue the parson who made the original

9

mistake?

10

MR. DURKIN;

11

that the new car —

12

QUESTION*

13

MR. DURKIN*

If in your hypothesis you suggest

Used car.
Used car was a day or two old,

14

because at the time my charter commenced, ay charter

15

commenced the day that ship left that shipyard.

relationship was with your immediate predecessor in title?

MR. DURKIN*

QUESTION*

The barebottom charter and the

leasing of an automobile are two different animals.
MR. DURKIN*

Oh, absolutely.

Oh, absolutely.

for purposes such as these maintain a position for these

11

purposes as if I were the owner.

12
13
14

Now, in order to get Delaval — that's not the
correct way to say it —
QUESTION*

ftnd the owner's position, the owner

15

would have had a contractual relationship, not with

16

Delaval but with the builder of the boat?

17

MR. DURKIN*

18

QUESTION*

19

MR. DURKIN *

Yes, sir.
Ttu boat or the ship, pardon me.
That is correct.

Row , the owner,

20

GECC, had no damage because GECC through the trust

21

company got from ae as the charterer the pe r diem or the

22

weekly or the monthly amounts that it was required to get

23

under the charter, whether or not the ship was

24

operational or non-o?erational.

25

They sustained no damages.

The only one here

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WAsmNGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

who sustained the damage was the charterer who had

2

absolutely nothin? to do with the building of the ship- or

3

the entering into any contract for the acquiring of the

4

turbines or anything else.

5

Now, in addition to the two million dollars, I

6

say that in round figures, in order to put the ship in a

7

condition for that particular work to be done, the

8

charterer had to pay the shipyards hundreds and hundreds

9

of thousands of dollars on top of that to equip the ship

10
-11

so as for the work that was reguired to be done on the
turbine's done.
Snd, sic,

12

the thirl claim of the damage that

13

comes is the amount that we had to pay to the owner under

14

the term of our charter, and the fourth claim of damage

15

would be that amount that we would be able tc collect

16

from our time charterer on our time charter in this case,

17

specific case with Sohio.

18

Now, there in the fourth —

19

QUESTION;

20

What contractual remedy would you

have against the owner from whom you chartered the ship?

21

MR. DURKIN;

22

QUESTION;

23

something, or what?

25

Because you didn't bargain for it or

MR. DURKIN;

24

fact.

None, sir.

Well, I'll give you the exact

In most — I have to say most because my

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(201) 628-9300

1

experiences with charters are limited, but I have never

2

yet seen a charter of this type where the term of the

3

charter document itself did

4

charterer to accept the particular vessel in an as is

5

condition.
QUESTIONS

6
7

Well, you just gave up any — you

just took the risk that it was, then?
MR. DURKIN*

8
9

not require the time

The risk as between myself and the

owner?

10

QUESTIONS

Yes.

11

MR. DURKIN*

I would think so, but I'm not so

12

sure, even if I didn't do that, under the facts of this

13

case the owner wouLd assume any of the responsibilities

14

that are imputable to Delaval because that owner had

15

nothing to do with the particular contract for the

16

acquiring of those turbines.

17

That was all done with the shipyard, and the

18

shipyard in turn had a contract, which contract was

19

assigned in this particular case to SECC via a trust

20

holding, and it was from that particular entity that the

21

charter was enunciated.

22
23

QUESTION*

Could you just clarify one other

thing for me?

24

MR. DURKIN*

25

QUESTION;

Surely, sir.
Does the charterer in this situation
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

get a contractual protection from anybody that the ship

2

is seaworthy?

3

take it in as is condition,

4

risk that something’s wrong with it?

Does anybody give any -- when you say#

MR. DURKIN*

5

they just take the entire

No, it isn’t that — there is

6

nothing in the charter, and the charter of course is part

7

of the record, that I can invite your attention to, that

8

would permit the charterer to claim against that owner

9

because of any claimed defect.

I can’t go that far as to

10

say that there wouldn’t be imposabie as a matter of law

11

upon that type of a contractual arrangement, that the

12

ship -—
QUESTION*

13

No, I didn’t mean — I'm trying to

14

stay away from legal obligation, just contractual.

15

mean the — your client in a situation lice this enters

16

into a transaction like this with no contractual

17

protection against the danger that the ship may be full

18

of holes or something like that?
MR. DURKIN*

19

You

Well , sir, that presupposes that

20

the charterer didn’t conduct the usual full inspections

21

prior to the time -QUESTION*

22

But he relies just on the visual

23

inspection of the ship and

24

risk?

25

MR. DURKIN*

so forth, and then takes the

No, sir.

It’s not solely on the

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

visual.

2

These type of inspections are in depth.
QUESTION;

But, I

mean, he doesn’t have any

3

contractual protection, that’s what I'm asking, so he has

4

to insure against this risk, is the only thing he can do?
HR. DURKIN *

5

Hell, it would be almost

6

impossible to even understand what the particular risk

7

that would be the subject of the particular coverage

8

involved.

Here the question is going to hone itself down

9
10

QUESTION*

Did something go wrong with the

11

turbine, might be one risk.

12

it?

13

something wrong with the product?

14

I mean,

It’s what happened, isn’t

it's not totally unforeseeable there’d be

HR. DURKIN*

No, and when you say it’s not

15

unforeseeable, I guess that would also include the

16

manufacturer who represented that if the manufacturer

17

could build turbines to the specifioation of those new

18

tankers being built.

19

Now, here's a circumstance where a subsequent

20

charterer, a subsequent charterer who absolutely, no

21

fault of his, absolutely no fault of his, is required to

22

expand very substantial monies to repair a turbine which

23

by all allegations was improperly manufactured.

24
25

Now, according to all of the circuits except
the Third, that charterer should not be put in that
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

particular position and that charterer should be able to

2

claim, if his proofs are sufficient to sustain the proofs

3

required in a damage claim.

4

those particular claims are not collectible because in

5

varying ways they say

6

classification of unreasonable risk.

7

8
9

QUESTION!

In product liability cases on land.
Only in product liability cases on

land, if somebody other than the plaintiff were to be
injured as a result of the involved episode or somebody
else's property ware to be damaged as a result of the
particular episode, under those cases I read them to mean
that that would satisfy the condition precedent.

SR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor
That’s

a very apt and fair comment.

I did want to mention one fact as

well that I think is very important, about the tort

5

aspect and the incorporation into admiralty of the

majority rule.

admiralty in a series of cases where the reason they were

9

incorporated in was that the federal court, sitting as

The majority rule, both in terms of

maritime courts, felt they were the better rule.
That’s the reason they were incorporated into

12

admiralty to begin with, so it seems to us ony logical

13

that starting with that premise, if those rules were

14

incorporated in because they were in fact the widespread

15

rules in the state, the version that is the majority rule

16

ought to be incorporated along with them and not a

17

disfavored rule.

18

Cn that, I want to point out to the Court that

traditionally been the Santor case decided by the Supreme

You say we apply tha same rule for

What

about airplane engines?
MR. SMITH;

I would say the same with airplane

engines.

manufacturers have some idea what their standard of
liability is, their purchasers know, and that whole area
is left to contractual bargaining, particularly as
between large commercial entities.
It really seems to me that this is a matter
that’s better left to the area of contract law rather
than tort law.
QUESTION;

Rarely have I seen a more confusing

case.
MR. SMITH;

There’s one further consideration

that I wanted to state, and that’s frequently as a basis,
the product tort liability law, the courts have said the
manufacturer has a greater ability to distribute the
risk.

I think once again that as between large

commercial entities,

that rationale doesn’t really

operate.
I think as between large commercial entities,
they both have the ability to insure or to otherwise

spread the risk to their customers in the form of higher

2

prices.

3

That rationale simply makes no sense here.
And as a matter of fact# I would suggest that

4

in many cases, actually the large commercial user of the

5

product is in better shape to distribute the risk to the

6

manufacturer.

7

product will be used.

8

that will be undertaken.

9

to which it intends to subject the product.

10

11

It knows the particular use to which the
It knows the particular voyages
It knows the particular hazards
So,

I think

that that rationale doesn’t hold up here at all.
We urge the Court to adopt the majority

12

land-based rule.

13

large commercial entities, the user of a defective

14

product who is complaining about tie guality of the

15

product below, should be left to his complaint in

16

contract law and not tort law.

17

We believe that at least as between

Commercial entities similarly situated should

18

be left to their contractual remedies, those they can

bargain for in the commercif.i context.

unless safety is implicated, the tort principle simply

shouldn’t interfere with their contract.
