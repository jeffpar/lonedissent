QUEST ION*

MS. KIEHAUSs

Were you trial counsel?
Ho, Your Honor.

The petitioner

6

asked for a hearing on his motion, but it was denied

basically on the ground that anybody can strike anybody

8

they want to.

9

the case.

Those are the words of the trial judge in

The same issue was raised on appeal, on

10

direct appeal to the Supreme Court cf Kentucky, and that

11

court also affirmed by stating that an allegation of

12

lack of a fair cross section on a jury which does not

13

concern systematic exclusion from the jury drum, which

14

is the composition device for the jury list, does not

15

rise to constitutional proportions, and therefore the

16

court refused to adopt any law.

17

I think as the Court can see,

18

trial court nor the Supreme Court of Kentucky was

19

willing to consider any regulation cf peremptory

20

challenges, and I think both followed the conventional

21

interpretation cf Swain versus Alabama which this Court

22

decided in 1965.
QUESTION*

23

neither of the

Well, the court could have, without

24

regard to Swain, could have proceeded under state law to

25

regulate.

Your Honor

that was net raised

2

in this particular case, although it certainly could.

3

It was not argued, although it was mentioned, but there

4

is no doubt that they could have proceeded cn that

5

basis.

6

there can be no questipn of peremptory challenges and

7

the way that they are exercised in any one particular

8

case.

The conventional interpretation cf cwain is that

This has been the basis for decisions of the

9

10

many state courts who have refused to consider the newer

11

rules that have been advanced by the Supreme Court of

12

California, the court in Massachusetts, and mere

13

recently by two federal appellate courts.

Is that correct?
That is what we are arguing,

You are not asking for a

reconsideration of Swain, and you are making no equal

So I ask aoain , wh\ don't you

attack Swain head on?
MB. NIEHPUS:

T believe that we will be

22

attacking it in the course of our argument, Your Honor,

23

because I think that the bases that underlie the proof

QUESTIONS

I thought you just answer! Justice

2

O'Connor by saying, no, you weren't really attacking

3

Swain except by implication.

4

HR. NIERAUSi

We have not made a specific

5

argument in the briefs that have been filed either in

6

the Supreme Court of Kentucky or in this Court saying

7

that we are attacking Swain as such.

8

that because the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to a

9

jury that is as representative of the community as

We have maintained

10

possible, that the Court may proceed on that basis alone

11

and may or may not have to alter its holding in Swain in

12

order to achieve its desire.

13

QUESTION;

Are you saying the Sixth Amendment

14

right: requires that the actual petit jury that tries the

15

case must be representative, or have our cases talked

16

about the panel?

17

UR. NTEHAUS;

No case specifically holds what

18

we a:e asking fcr today.

19

of course is Taylor versus Louisiana,

20

panels from which the petit jury is actually selected.

21

We are asking for an extension.

22

QUESTION;

The most apposite case, which
speaks cnly to the

I wculd suppose until peremptory

23

challenges are just out entirely, you would have to just

24

be talking about the panel, because even if you win this

25

case, there are going to be a lot of peremptory

challenges exercise! for other reasons that might well

2

eliminate identifiable groups in the community.
MB. NIEHAUSi

3

I think that that is quite so,

4

and as long as these peremptory challenges are exercised

5

for some reason related to the matter at hand, I think

6

tnat the cause for objection is going to be removed.

7

the Court will recall the remedy that we have proposed

8

in this case, which is based primarily on the Supreme

9

Court of California’s rules set cut in Wheeler, if there

If

10

is some reason

that explains in the context of a

11

particular case, and I would ask the Court to note that

12

in the first section of Swain the Court also linked the

13

exercise of peremptory challenges to the context of a

"4

particular case.

15

then certainly groups will and probably should be

16

removed, but it is the argument here that if they are

17

being removed,

18

race, this is a destruet .on of the representative nature

19

cf the jury without sufficient reason, and for that

20

reason the peremptory challenges that are exercised must

21

be regulated.

If this explanation is satisfactory,

as in this case, simply for reasons of

QUESTION*

22

As I understand the California

23

rule, it also apolies to peremptories by defendants?

24

I correct?

MR. NIEHAUS*

Yes.

adopted that
QUESTION;

And that would follow along with

ycur arg ument?

4

MS. NIEHAUSs

Your Honor, we have net put that

5

argument forward simply because it is not necessary to

6

obtain the relief we desire in this case.
QUESTION;

7

Well, but I think at least speaking

8

for myself I would like to knew what the consequences,

9

the logical consquences of adopting your rule are, and I

10

take it if most state courts have adopted it and felt

11

obliged to extend it to defendants, that might well be a

12

logical con se quer.ee .
MR. NIEHAD3;

13
14

Oh, I think that it could ba,

Your Honor, but the Court could also consider -QUESTION:

15

Well, how can you do that under a

16

Sixth Amendment claim?

17

reach that result under an equal protection claim, which

18

you aren’t making, but I don’t see how the Sixth

19

Amendment does anything but speak to the defendant’s own

20

rights.

21

ME. NIEHAUSi

I can understand how you could

This is quite right, Your Honor,

22

tut the courts that have addressed the matter and more

23

recently the case in Booker versus Jade from the Sixth

24

Circuit, which we have not had time to file with the

25

Court, simply talks about fairness between the parties,

and that it does tend to diminish the perception of

2

fairness in the eyes of the public,

have perceived a — I guess you would say a right

emanating, although not specifically state, cut of the

Sixth Amendment, wherein the courts may impose the same

rule on the defendant in order to bring cut the

MR. NIEHAUSs

16

under the Fourteenth Amendment.

17

Court's cases decided in the 1940's under the

18

supervisory power, there has always been an idea that

19

the jury must be representative of the community, and we

20

have provided in our brief a compilation of some

21

statements on this fact.

22

No, it was equal protection
But even before this

And the practical reason for this is tc

23

interpose a body of untrained citizens between the

24

defendant and the forces of the prosecutor, so that when

25

the prosecutor employs his challenges to remove a

1

cognizable group from the jury that is actually going to

2

sit, he is destroying any chance that this jury is going

3

to be as repicsentaciva of the jury as is possible,

4

given the fact that you must reduce the community to a

5

panel and finally to a petit jury of 12 or 13.

6

When the prosecutor does this, he is attacking

7

the democratic aspect of the jury wherein the community

8

consents to the conviction.

9

the administrative officers in charge of the matter, tut

10
11

It is not left simply to

the community itself by its representatives' consent.
The federal courts of appeal have begun

12

adopting a rule that basically follows the rule set out

13

in Wheeler versus California,

and these cases reject the

14

convoluted and probably often

poorly understood

15

statistical analyses that are associated with the venire

16

composition cases, and have instead returned tc what I

17

consider to be a more well known pattern of evidentiary

18

inferences, ard all of the cases that are listed in the

19

briefs begin with the concept announced in Taylor versus

20

Louisiana which talks about the federal right to jury

21

trial, and that is that the selection of a petit jury

22

from a representative cross section of the community is

23

an essential component of the Sixth Amendment right to

24

trial by jury.

of the problem in reducing numbers, that that is not

I think that under the Kentucky

14

system, that that is probably the way the relief must be

dene, because peremptory challenges are exercised all at

16

once at. the close of challenges for cause.

17

California and some other states it is an ongoing

18

process, and a pattern can emerge as the challenges are

19

exercised, but th'• e/idence that I would point out to

20

the Court is that provided for by Wheeler pointing cut,

21

first of all, that out of so many challenges that are

22

available to the prosecutor,

QUESTION!

'''rue.

One thing he can't say, I suppose,

is that this venire person is black, and the defendant

11

is black, and therefore I would rather have a white

12

juror than a black juror.

13

ME. NIEHAUS*

I think

so, because it is -- the

14

fact that the prospective juror is a black rather than

15

any reason why, any articulable reason why there is a

16

specific suspected bias that is the motivating cause for

17

removal of this juror.

MR. NIEHAUSs

Wow, what about

Sell, the harm is there,

perhaps, but maybe not as severe, because in most areas

of the country I believe that even if a defendant

in this case is that far from standing as an aberration

in the law, Swain against Alabama fits into a consistent

Swain was an equal protection case, but surely the

that history more firmly supports the right on the part

Because that is a matter of

The judge

is not supposed to intrude into litigation decisions of

that kind as long as he feels that the jury that is

being impaneled is an impartial one that meets the

requirements of the Sixth Amendment.

14

The very nature of the peremptory challenge is

15

that probably in most cases, probably the great

majority, it tends to reduce or eliminate the

represntation of certain parts of the cross-section of

18

the community from the particular jury.
