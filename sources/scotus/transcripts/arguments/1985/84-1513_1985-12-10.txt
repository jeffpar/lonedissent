Amendment, and the California Supreme Court denied a

4

The ultimata issue in this case is, as in the

5

companion case, Dow, whether Ciraolo had an expectation

6

of privacy against aerial observation of his garden that

7

society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.

8

Our position in this case is straightforward.

9

When a person's property is concealed from public view,

10

then the fact of its possession is private, tut if

11

property is in public view,

12

and hence it is not a subject of Fourth Amendment

13

protection.

it is in no sense private,

Ciraolo's garden, whatever else one can say

14
15

about it, was knowingly exposed to the scrutiny, the

16

observation, the identification, if you will, of

17

literally anyone in aircraft above or around his

18

property.

3

To me the photography case, if that is what Your Honor

4

is asking, specifying the — or focusing on the

photography that the officer did, to me it is

6

indistinguishable from a case where the officer was

looking down from the airplane, saw it, and had a

What is your view of —

3

MR. SULLIVAN:

My view is that there are lots

of other ways of handling that kind of problem .

7

remedies through an injunction action --

9
10

It seems to me there might well be

QUESTIONi

8

The

Is there a Fourth Amendment

violation by virtue of the low level hovering helicopter
in your view or not?

11

MR. SULLIVANi

I suspect that if you are

12

hovering over 20 feet you have got a strong case that it

13

may well be, but I am saying that if this Cort was ever

14

presented with that situation, it probably would first

15

look to the question of whether there realistically are

16

better ways of adapting or controlling for that kind of

17

abuse.

18

I don’t mean to say in any way that cops

19

should be going around hovering at 25 feet.

20

that the Fourth Amendment does respond to the fact that

21

there are remedies, and you don’t necessarily have to

22

constitutionalize something every time somebody says,

23

gee, that really seems offensive to me.

24
25

QUESTION:

I am saying

Well, perhaps you don’t, but do you

recognize that there are Fourth Amendment limits to the

about.

Your Honor, that to my mind the reason why the

24

guy -- really the question is does he have to maintain

25

his fence, because that is how the observation was

from, does he have to take any protections at all, which

3

is Ciraolo saying, no, he doesn’t.

4

5

That seems to me to be a quite different question

That seems to me to

As far as the ladder is concerned, I go back

6

to the proposition that ordinarily when you have a

7

situation where a person can walk into a hotel lobby,

8

which I did this morning, and saw sitting there aerial

9

photography of Washington, including pictures of fenced

10

residential yards, I think you are in a different

11

situation than saying that the police can go up and take

12

a hook and ladder truck and stair out over your fence.

13

I mean, putting aside, quite aside any

14

physical invasiveness difference, and I think there

probably is --

If that is your test, what if the

respondent here had grown a big tree or something that

knothole is that in many cases I can foresee it being

perfectly legitimate.

20

and I turn my head and I see a hole in a wall, and

21

through it I see a plant, a marijuana plant,

22

consider that to be a violation of the Fourth

23

Amendment.

24

I am going to ask a lot of questions, like what is the

25

purpose of the hole?

QUESTION;

I mean, they give you a hole so that

If it is a knothole you have to

stand on a ladder to see through, then it is had?
MR.

7

SULLIVAN;

Well, there are -- you have to

8

draw distinctions that respond to people's

9

foreseeabilities, to the foreseeability of situations.

10

And it doesn't bother me to say that people don't expect

11

the police to put a ladder up to their fence and to say

12

at the same time that if a policeman is walking down the

13

sidewalk and you left a hole like this in your fence and

14

he turns his head and sees a marijuana plant, he can act

15

on that.

16

That distinction doesn't bother me at all, no.
In our view, Ciraolo cannot claim an

17

expectation recognized by society that members of the

18

public can see his marijuana garden but police may not

19

do so any more than he could legitimately claim that

20

redhaired people can see his marijuana garden from

21

aircraft but not brownhaired people.

22

What the Fourth Amendment in cur view permits

23

the police to do is to enter an area that is publicly

24

accessible, and there, and certainly navigable air space

25

is such an area, and there they may see what is normally

decision in Karo.

mention of parabolic microph ones, that if the officer

15

marches down, the street and doesn’t have the parabolic

what I

that the curtilage warrants the Fourth Amendment

statement that I believe was made in the lead opinion.

I think what Ciraolo is asking this Court to

that statement as meaning that the

7

that the level of expectations in the home attached to

said protections of the Fourth Amendment.

That is not what the statement said. It

The level of privacy expected in the home, I

10
11

submit to you, is different than the level of privacy

12

outside in the curtilage because by custom, by habit,

13

when we want the highest level of privacy, we retire

14

into the home.

15

what protections attach to the curtilage, one has to

know what level of protection attaches to the home,

as far as the focus argument that I can expect police to

QUESTION':

Mr. Sullivan, in Oliver we had an

2

open field a substantial distance from any residence,

3

find you have just been talking about the privacy

4

protected within a home.

5

Oliver, often is considered to be a part of the

6

residential area occupied by a family.

7

is, however, as I understand

it, that the curtilage is

8

more like an open field than

it is like a home.

9

what your argument is?

10

MR. SULLIVANi

The curtilage, as suggested in

No,

Your argument

Is that

Your Honor, because if I

11

was going to make that argument, I would be saying -- I

12

would be contradicting myself in saying the police can

13

walk into your back yard.

14

whether or not, in my view, whether or not there is a

15

fence or not.

16

can’t physically trespass it.

can take a camera and photograph exactly what they saw,

MR. SULLIVAN;

Same rule, I suppose,

makes one whit of difference or not the officer has a

What I am saying is that if the public can be

there and if the police can be there and see the thing

routinely, which I guess they can, because Ciraolo says

there because they are following up their suspicion that

led them to that place?

It just doesn't make any sense

I think that there is no constitutional

As far as what the curtilage is. Justice
Rehnquist, I think a very good description of what we

expect in the curtilage is found in the Sixth Circuit en

banc decision in the Dow Chemical case, and I hope my

12

predecessors in this Court will excuse me for citing

13

that opinion, but it is a very fine discussion of what

14

is the curtilage, how far it extends, and what it means

15

in American jurisprudence, and I think the Sixth Circuit

16

was using that to distinguish it from the Dow plant, and

17

perhaps for that reason they laid it on very heavy, but

18

it is a very fine description of what the curtilage of

19

the home is.

20

I think that the Oliver discussion of

protection of the curtilage would be meaningless if an

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE K. SULLIVAN, ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

18

MR. SULLIVAN*

Just very briefly, Ycur Honor.

19

I do agree with one thing that Mr. Krause does say in

20

this case, and that is that Fourth Amendment cases are

21

decided by reality and not hypotheticals, but what he

22

keeps talking about seems to be some distinction between

23

intense looking and non-intense looking, and routine and

24

focusing, and for the life of me I don't understand

25

those arguments, because -- I mean I know what air

So, in terms of focusing, I just don't understand

7

The only other thing I wanted to say is, the

8

tenor or the sound that I get from the respondent in

9

this case is that there is something really oppressive

10

and egregious and perhaps subjective but nonetheless

11

there, and I know the Court doesn't like to listen to

12

quotes, but to get the flavor of this case, the fellow's

13

name involved in this is Officer Schutz, Detective John

14

Schutz, and he was the only witness at the suppression

15

hearing, and this is the officer as he makes --

16

describing his intensive scrutinizing, his focus.
