such as affiliation with an international union which is

12

Accordingly, the Board has established a

procedure, which I have referred to earlier, whereby it

will permit a union that has affiliated or undergone

15

some other similar organic change to step into the shoes

of the old union without a Board election, provided that

MR. COME;

I started to say that there are two

24

requirements before the Board will amend a

25

The first is t.o be satisfied that the

favor the change.

The second requirement is that the

That’s referred to as a break in continuity.

8

Tf you get a break in continuity, then the Board says,

9

that presents a question that is going to have to be

10

re solved.

11

QUESTIONS

Through certif ica tion?

12

MR . COMEi

Through certification,

so that

13

we're only at step one of what is a -- the inquiry that

14

the Board will make before it determines that it can use

15

the short-cut procedure or whether it's got to go

16

through the long procedure.

17

I want to save the balance of my time for

18

rebuttal, but the point that I want to leave with is

19

that, as I started to say, we submit as I 'm sure my

20

colleague will flesh out, that the Board's current

21

position is a reasonable one and consonant with the

22

policies of the Act 3nd therefore should be sustained.

note two aspects of this case.

First of all, the

2

Board's present ruLe applies only where there is a

3

change in the organizational structure of a certified

4

bargaining representative that in the Board's judgment

5

is not sufficient to destroy the continuity of the

6

selected representative.
This is not a situation in which the Board has

7
8

determined that organization "A" no longer exists and

9

that organization "B” has come into being.

Rather, the

10

Board's premise and the very reason it has determined

11

that its representation procedures as stated in Section

12

9 of the Act are not applicable is that there is one

13

organization and only one organization, an organization

14

which has stood the test of a representation election

15

and which continues.
Secondly,

this is not a situation in which the

union "s. interest is to secure from the Board.some

Secondly, the Board says, but even if this

isn't a question concerning the selection of a new

representative, it is a decision that, quote,

"significantly affects the union’s representation cf the

12

That in our judgment is not open to attack on

13

the ground that it is inconsistent with the Board’s

major premise, namely that there is continuity.

15

it’s inconsistent with the background I was attempting

16

to spell out.

17

But

The National Labor Relations Board is an

18

extremely important agency which has a central role in

labor-management relations.

20

everything having to do with labor-management relations.

I*d like to emphasize two points about the

2
3

reason that these are differences of substance.

4

Board determination that the union has to conduct its

5

affairs in a particular way may have absolutely nothing

6

to do with any fair evaluation of the type cf events

7

which will cause a change of employee sentiment.
I certainly don’t know of anything, the Board

10

employees will react to a dues increase versus how they

11

will react to a change in affiliation versus how they

12

will react to a change in the constitution of the

13

union.

14

there are people who can and normally do have a

15

commitment to the process which is greater than their

16

commitment to any particular issue.

17

In all our democratic affairs we understand that

You can have the hardest-fought political

campaign in this country and a vote of 51 or 50.2,

19

whatever President Kennedy wen by, to 49.9, and that

20

doesn’t mean that after the election that the 49 percent

21

22

What the change means is a very complex

23

inquiry and there’s just no need in this situation,

24

given the way Congress structured the Act, to look to

25

the kinds of issues the Board is trying to inject itself

The employer doesn't have to show anything

QUESTION:

Yes, exactly, but as long as it

MR. GOLD:

That’s correct.

QUESTION*

1

I guess for the same reason, Kr.

2

Gold, you'd argue that this certainly doesn't fall

3

within the category of a change to adapt to changing

4

patterns of industrial life?

5

ME. GOLD*

No.

Indeed,

the one constant in

6

industrial life in this country, and

7

Congress was very, very well aware of when it came to

8

look at the Act in '47, has been the conflict between

9

differing groups of unions.
There was an AFI and

10

there was a CIO.

The

early cases concern unions bouncing back and forth.
QUESTION;

12

Incidentally, Kr. Gold, may some

13

unions change affiliation as they attempted here,

14

without any vote of their membership?

15

ME. GOLD*

Yes, there are many unions —

16

QUESTION;

Hell, does that require a

17

that

constitutional provision in the union constitution?
MB. GOLD;

18

Yes.

Most unions deal with this

19

question, one of the most basic ones so far as the

20

evolution of the organization is concerned, in their

21

constitution and normally when you get national

22

organizations you don't have every member voting, as you

will notice,
