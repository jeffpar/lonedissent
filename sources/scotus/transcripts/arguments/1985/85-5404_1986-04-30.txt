That is the proof beyond a

Allen is a sexually dangerous person beyond a reasonable

QUESTION:

Is that possible in a civil case?

17

MR. MEINZ:

That was the thrust cf the

decision in Statulak versus Coughlin, a Seventh Circuit

denominated civil, was sufficiently criminal as to

QUESTION:

Mr. Meinz, do I understand from

3

ycur response that Justice Marshall's question about the

4

burden of procf that the source of the beyond a

5

reasonable doubt burden was not the Illinois legislature

6

but a Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit

7

decision?
/

MB. MEINZ;

8
9

Yes, Ycur Honor.

Originally the

statute, and certainly the case law under it, specified

10

a preponderance of the evidence standard.

That was

11

litigated in

12

Stachulak versus Coughlin, an opinion by Chief Judge

13

Eairchild at that time, the Seventh Circuit ruled that

14

there must be proof beyond a reasonable dcutt.

15

standard must be applied.

a habeas corpus action, and in 1975 in

That

After that decision, the Illinois Supreme

16
17

Court in People versus Pembrcck also ruled, albeit

18

independently, they said, that there was a reasonable

19

doubt standard.

20

incorporated a reasonable doubt standard in that

21

legislatcn in its revision in 1981.
QUESTION:

The legislature picked up the cue and

wasn't he?

MR. MEINZ:

2

Yes, it is, and it will be until

3

such time as Sr. Allen can prove that he has recovered

4

from the sexually dangerous person condition.

5

time, and only at that time, will the underlying charge

6

against him be dismissed.
MR. MEINZ:

7

At that

Eut it isn’t likely that he will

/

8

ever be tried for that crime?
MR. MEINZ :

9

It is not likely that he will ever

10

be tried for the crime, a crime of deviant sexual

11

assault and -QUESTION:

12

As long as he is not cured, he

13

won’t be tried, and when he is cured, it will be

14

dismissed .
MR. MEINZ:

15

That is true.

The Question is,

16

and»cne significant focus of cur argument is that ve may

17

be talking about —* we are certainly talking about an

18

indefinite period of time before he can prove that he

That is true.

Well, I knew, but in that respect

it is the same.

MR. MEINZ:

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

3

CRAI ARGUMENT BY MARK I. RCTFRT , ESQ.,

4

Hr. Rotert .

ON BEHALF CF THE RESPONDENT
MB. ROTERT:

5

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6

please the Court, there are several points cn which

7

respondents differ significantly from the petitioner cn

8

both the facts and the law that are relevant to this

9

particular inquiry this morning.

/

One-cf the most important differences that I

10
11

would like to emphasize at the cutset is that the

12

immunity provision as provided by the Illinois Supreme

13

Court in this very case is coextensive with the

14

privilege against self-incrimination which the

15

respondent to a Sexually Dangerous Persons Act should

16

have.

17

There is no question that the respondent tc a

18

sexually dangerous persons proceeding has the ability to

19

claim a Fifth Amendment privilege in any proceeding, but

20

there is also no question that in this case the Illinois

21

Supreme Court has immunized that person.

22

Terry Allen said to any psychiatrist at any pcint in

23

time can ever be used against him in any criminal

24

prosecution fcr the underlying sex offenses.

25

Nothing that

The Illinois Supreme Court has made that very

And this is coextensive with the Fifth Amendment

2

privilege, and this Court has reccgnieed that

3

repeatedly, that transactional immunity is net what the

4

Fifth Amendment requires.
QUESTIONj

5

But of course his claim is that

6

because this:was so much like a criminal proceeding, it

7

shouldn't have been used against him in this proceeding,

8

that he shouldn't have been callable for any purpose, I

9

.guess.
MR. RCTERT:

10

That is certainly true. Justice

11

Rehnquist, and I think that leads us to the second major

12

fundamental distinction between the parties, and that is

13

the position of the state of Illinois that this is a

14

civil statute.

15

legislature that drafted it and enacted it said it was

16

civil.

It is a civil statute because the

17

It is a civil statute because the Supreme

18

Court cf Illinois, which has had the opportunity tc

19

evaluate it, has concluded it to be civil.

20

civil statute because in its effect and in its purpose

21

it does what a civil statute is designed to do.

22

admit that it does it in the context of due process

23

safeguards.which are often found in criminal cases, but

24

we point out in our brief how ironic it is that the

25

state of Illinois provides more due process safeguards

50
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. ROTERT;

1

I don’t believe that Gault is a

2

particularly helpful case in this context, Justice

3

C'Conncr, for the reason that I think that Gault

4

involved a juvenile statute, and the language of the

5

Court involved quite clearly indicates that it

6

considered the actual effect of the statute involved on

7

the juvenile to be indistinguishable from a criminal

8

effect that a person would suffer, and in Gault, for

9

example, it was noted that an adult convicted of the

/

10

same offense would have received a petty fine whereas

11

the juvenile was subjected tc incarceration until he

12

reached the age of majority under certain

13

circumstances.
So the Court weas concerned that the apparent

14
15

intent of the statute was to punish criminals, and I .

16

think that Gault is very much like Specht and some of

17

the cases in the Petitioner’s brief where a conviction

18

is obtained, and then there are benignly labeled

19

treatments given contingent upon conviction as

20

alternatives tc sentencing, and if we required Terry

21

Allen to be convicted of a sex offense before we offered

22

this treatment, perhaps the issue in analysis would be

23

different.

24
25

But I think here the fact that Illinois not
only doesn’t proceed on the criminal prosecution but

QUESTIONS

Oh, really.

14

MR. ROTERTi

Yes,. I do, because first of all,

Terry Allen would have a constitutional right to get .

that the witnesses for the state would be cress examined

Your bias is very patent.

IWhen you look at what the state would have to

do, the prosecutor would be well within his discretion

to say if I’m going to go through all of that trouble,

10

I’m going to go for felony conviction, and tc heck with

11

sending him tc a psychiatric institute.

12

The point is that you’ve placed in unnecessary

13

fashion the Fifth Amendment in a context where it

14

doesn’t apply and provided a disincentive for the

15

provision for treatment.

16

The idea that we can use circumstantial

17

evidence to prove something as private as a mental

18

disorder is very, very difficult to accept.

19

21

QUESTIONS

I wouldn’t describe it all as

circumstantial evidence.
MR. ROTERT;

Well, there is direct evidence cf

22

the psychiatrist that he has examined the individual and

23

drawn certain conclusions.

24

direct evidence from a psychiatric examination.

25

would have to provide secondary resources;

HR. ROTERT:

Well, I think that the persons

by this.

20

the Court is familiar with the cases, the Supreme Court

of Illinois has been sc solicitous of the procedural and

For all these reasons, I urge the Court to

consider the Illinois Sexually Eangercus Persons Act tc

enacted it, and as does the Supreme Court which

Based on the idea that it is a civil statute,

I ask the Court to follow its own well-established
