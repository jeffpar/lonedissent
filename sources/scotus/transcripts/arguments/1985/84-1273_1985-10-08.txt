P R OCEEDINGS

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

3

first tnis morning in Regents of the University of Michigan

4

against Ewing.

5

Mr. Daane, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RODERICK K. DAANE, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. DAANE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

This case is here on certiorari to the Sixth

11

Circuit, which concluded that the University of Michigan

12

had treated the Respondent unconstitutionally when it denied

13

him two chances to take a test that he had flunked in the

14

University's Medical School.

15

For purposes of this argument, I shall assume

16

the existence of a constitutionally protectible property

17

right in Respondent's continued enrollment in the University's

18

Medical School while on what might be termed good academic

19

behavior.

20

I shall argue that the Sixth Circuit erred in

21

its decision that the University arbitrarily and

22

capriciously deprived Mr. Ewing —

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. DAANE:

Because, Justice Powell —

25

QUESTION:

You don't concede it, do you?

May I ask why you make that assumption?

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. DAANE:

I just assume it as the Court did

2

in Horowitz because I believe it is not essential to reach

3

that issue in order to decide this case on the narrower

4
5

ground of whether Mr. Ewing was treated by the University
in an arbitrary and capricious way.

issue?

What if we disagree with you on your

What happens to the property interest

We just affirm them or not?
MR. DAANE:

Most certainly not, Justice White.

I think you would be able to find that Mr. Ewing was not
treated in an arbitrary and capricious way and —
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but what if we agree

with the Court of Appeals that if there

is

a property interest

there was a consitutional violation?
MR. DAANE:

Then, of course, I suppose you would

have to affirm.
QUESTION:

Because you are not going to argue

about the property interest issue.
MR. DAANE:

I am going to say, Justice White,

23

that the idea of arguing the property interest has some

24

appeal for me and the idea that there should not be a

25

property interest in such as thing as a course grade or

a qualification, an academic qualification.

3

QUESTION:

You didn't present the property interest

question in your petition.

4

MR. DAANE:

5

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Well, no, I am not sure I agree with

6

Justice White on that.

7

as I read it, is the state medical school procedurally

8

correct, dismissal of an academically deficient student

9

subject to substantive due process review and reversal by

10

the federal court.

11

Your second question presented,

I think that raises the property issue.

MR. DAANE:

Clearly it is within the parameters

12

of the question as framed in the petition, Justice

13

Rehnquist.

14
15

QUESTION:

You are not going to present it though,

is that right?

16

MR. DAANE:

17

QUESTION:

18

the question was in the case.

19

I agree.
The Solicitor General said he thought

MR. DAANE:

Yes, and the Solicitor General's

20

position, Justice Powell, is, as I said, quite attractive

21

to me.

22

a narrower basis.

I will argue the property interest if

23

the Court wishes.

I don't mean to suggest that it is not

24

a legitimate question.

25

I just think that the case can be disposed of on

I mean to suggest only that I believe the case

can be disposed of on the narrower grounds of whether —
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, maybe we think it is narrower

to decide it on whether it is property.

4

MR. DAANE:

5

QUESTION:

Very well, Justice O'Connor.
What is the agreement or the under­

6

standing that students have who are admitted to the Medical

7

School in your state?
MR. DAANE:

8
9

The understanding that they have,

Justice O'Connor, is that they should be permitted to proceed

10

in the program while they are meeting the requirements of

11

the Medical School's faculty, while they are on what I term

12

good academic behavior.
QUESTION:

13

Are there provisions in the application

14

forms that maks it a matter of discretion of the faculty

15

to retain the student?
MR. DAANE:

16

In the official bulletins of the

17

Medical School, Justice O'Connor -- I am referring now to

18

Exhibits 36 aid 39, which are the two bulletins which were

19

effective at the time Mr. Ewing matriculated and at the

20

time he flunked out — there are clear provisions conferring

21

upon the Promotion Board's discretion to pass, to fail,

22

or to take any one of many intermediate actions between

23

those two extremes with respect to the enrolled students,

24

yes.

25

I would like to review quite briefly Mr. Ewing's
6

(202) 628-9300

1

record admission.

2

He flunked out in the summer of '81.

3

He matriculated in the fall of 1975.

While he was with us he accumulated an unenviable

4

academic record which included numerous low grades, seven

5

incompletes, two terms during which he was on leaves of

6

absence, several terms during which he was on an irregular

7

or reduced course load schedule.
The faculty had devoted considerable time to helping

8
9

him along at the point which was reached in mid-summer 1980

10

when they warned him in writing — and that writing appears

11

at 146 of the Joint Appendix — that one more deficiency

12

would be cause for his being dropped from registration.
Now, that deficiency could have taken the form,

13
14

if the Court please, of a failure in a course grade or a

15

failure on a final exam, but in Mr. Ewing's case it :ook

16

the form of a failure on the National Board of Medical

17

Examiners, Part I Exam.

18

This is a two-day exam which tests students in

19

seven subject matter areas.

20

of the seven with the egregiously low score of 235 against

21

a passing standard of 345 which has since been raised to

22

380.

23

the combined baccalaureate and medical school program in

24

which
Respondent was enrolled and occasioned concerned on
•

25

the part of the faculty, Promotion and Review Board, which

Mr. Ewing flunked five out

That score was the lowest in the Inteflex program,

(202) 628-9300

1

met the following month to review his record and determine

2

his eligibility to continue.

3

That meeting took place on July 24, 1981, and

4

was the first of what was to be five meetings of the Michigan

5

faculty devoted to reviewing Mr. Ewing's record.

6

were two Promotion Board meetings and three meetings of

7

the Medical School's Executive Committee.

There

8

If you add all of that up, you will find that

9

over two dozen senior faculty members at the University

10

of Michigan's Medical School devoted countless hours to

11

reviewing Mr. Ewing's progress through the Medical School

12

both before and after.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DAANE:

Where is Mr. Ewing now?
He is in Chicago, I am informed by

15

Counsel, enrolled in the Chicago College of Osteopathy,

16

Justice Blackmun.

17
18

QUESTION:

I take it there is no racial overtone

in this case?

19

MR. DAANE:

20

The faculty reviews were unanimous of the opinion

None whatsoever.

21

that Mr. Ewing should be dropped from registration.

22

He appealed the first such determination.

He

23

appeared before the faculty's Promotion and Review Board,

24

submitted both written evidence and spoke to the Board and

25

was questioned by the Board.

1

Significantly, the questions, particularly those

2

posed by Dr. Friedman, were directed to the point that Mr.

3

Ewing was well aware at the time he sat for the examination

4

of the grave — the gravity of his academic condition at

5

that point.

Dr. Friedman also testified, by the way, that
he alone -QUESTION:

May I just ask you one question at

this point.

10

MR. DAANE:

11

QUESTION:

Certainly.
What is all of this relevant to?

If

12

he has no constitutional right, the University didn't have

13

to do any of this, did it?

14

MR. DAANE:

15

QUESTION:

16

18
19

20
21

22
23

Well —
What is the legaJ point you are making?

I am kind of curious.
MR. DAANE:

The legal point is the care and

deliberation which went into the decision to terminate.
QUESTION:

But, they didn't have to do any of

that, did they?
MR. DAANE:

No, they didn't as a matter of law.

I think they over did what they were required to do.
QUESTION:

How does that go to the question of

24

what they were required to do which is really what we are

25

interested in.

MR. DAANE:

It goes to the admonition of this

2

Court in Board of Curators v. Horowitz, I believe, Your

3

Honor, that a careful and deliberate decision made by

4

professional decision makers such as those on Michigan's

5

faculty should not be reviewed by the courts.

Yes, we have argued them on brief.
Are you going to argue that?
I hadn't intended to today, Your Honor.
You rest on your briefs?

Yes.

The Eleventh Amendment issue

18

in this case is interesting because of the way in which

19

the case stands at the intersection of the Eleventh and

20

the Fourteenth.

21

implicated by the complaint Mr. Ewing makes against the

22

University of Michigan.

There really are very few federal rights

He asserts in essence that what we have done is

failed to follow what is really a state law rule.

5

He doesn't say, for example,
He doesn't

He doesn't allege that he has been punished for

the exercise of a First Amendment freedom of speech privilege,

7

anything of that kind.

8
9

What he argues is that our decision makers were
prevented or should have been prevented from making the

10

professional, academic decision that they made by a so-called

11

rule which automatically entitled him to take two cracks

12

at passing the NBME exam.

13

If you strip the bark off his argument, that is

14

really what it amounts to.

15

decision of the faculty which considered him to be an

16

unqualified student, unqualified to go forward.

17

QUESTION:

He is complaining about the

On the Eleventh Amendment issue, there

18

is a motion, as I understand it, by the Respondent to be

19

allowed to amend the complaint now to name the Regents

individually.

Do you

oppose the granting of that motion?
MR. DAANE:

We did not file a response to that

motion, Justice O'Connor, and my candid opinion is that

(202) 628-9300

1

it really doesn't change the applicability of the Eleventh

Amendment defense, because the motion —

3

QUESTION:

Do you think if they were named

4

individually that you could still argue the Eleventh Amend­

5

ment defense?

6

MR. DAANE:

Yes, I do, Justice O'Connor, because

7

the motion does not seek to name them in their individual

8

capacities.

9

capacities, and it seems to me that really does not change

It seeks to name them in their official

10

the nature of the case for Eleventh Amendment purposes in

11

any terribly significant way.

MR.. DAANE:

MR. DAANE:

No.
Sorry.

I think it is Brandon v. Holt.

Brandon v. Holt, 469 U.S., Justice Marshall,

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DAANE:

15

QUESTION:

16

That is it.
Was there any similar motion made before

the District Court or Court of Appeals?

17

MR. DAANE:

18

QUESTION:

19

That is it?

There was not, Your Honor.
So, neither of those Courts have had

an opportunity to consider this question.

20

MR. DAANE:

21,

There was an Eleventh Amendment decision made

That is correct, Your Honor.

22

by the District Court which concerned the Respondent's claim

23

for damages in that Court and dismissed Count Three of the

24

complaint on the basis of the Eleventh Amendment.

25

That decision, of course, preceded this Court's

decision in Pennhurst.

2

that it was an intolerable intrusion upon state sovereignty

3

for federal courts to order states to conform their conduct

4

to state law, it changed the nature of the Eleventh Amendment

5

issue for us sort of mid-way between the District Court

6

and the Court of Appeals.

7

In Pennhurst, when the Court decided

We argued the Pennhurst case on application for

8

rehearing in the Court of Appeals and that application for

9

rehearing was denied.

out arguing the Eleventh Amendment and then when you reach

13

the merits you said that the decision on the merits, it

14

sounded a shock wave throughout the community of medical

15

schools throughout the country.

to me at least that you thought it of great national importance

17

that the merits be addressed.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. DAANE:

I do think the Fourteenth Amendment

2

issue is of critical importance to the higher education

3

community and to the tradition of academic freedom in this

4

country which this Court's precedence and policy have upheld

5

for many, many years, and that is the issue that I intend

6

to address with the Court this morning.

7

I would like to get back to the contention on

8

the part of Respondent that the University failed to follow

9

its own rule in this case when it denied him a second chance

10
11

at the exam.
I would like to assure the Court that this is

12

not a case in which the University of Michigan failed to

13

follow its own rule.

14

In the first place, we had no rule automatically

15

entitling a student to a retest.

16

granted was granted after specific action of the Promotion

17

and Review Board authorizing such a retest.

18

was an exercise of the discretion which I earlier made ref erence

19

to in the University's bulletin.

20
21

QUESTION:

Each retest which was

That action

Mr. Daane, in the opinion of the Court

of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit — I am looking now at

22

Page 33-A where that opinion is contained in the petition —

23

The Court of Appeals says,

24

that it was the consistent practice of the University of

25

Michigan to allow a qualified medical student who initially

"in sum, the evidence demonstrates

4

failed the NBME, Part I, an opportunity for a retest."
Do you challenge that factual determination of
the Court of Appeals?
MR. DAANE:

I challenge the way in which the Court

5

of Appeals expressed it, Justice Rehnquist.

6

call it a consistent result than a consistent practice.

I would rather

7

But, it is true that Mr. Ewing was the only one

8

of the several students with whom he compares himself who

9

was not afforded the opportunity for a retest.

10

But, that result came about as a product of the

11

specific individual review by the Promotion Board in each

12

case of the eligibility of each student to continue.

13

QUESTION:

Your position then is it was the con­

14

sistent practice or at least a consistent result, but the

15

circumstances were sufficiently different in Ewing's case

16

so that a different result was justified?

17

1

it, in the light of the statement of the policy of allowing

2

re-examination?

3

MR. DAANE:

Re-examinations are allowed in the

4

discretion of the faculty when faculty considers it

5

appropriate to do so on the basis of the student's potential,

6

the student's overall record, performance in the courses

7

already taken.

8
9
10
11

There is an awful lot of subjective judgment that
goes into those decisions, Mr. Chief Justice, and, therefore,
it is very difficult for me to answer —•
QUESTION:

Is there anything in this record about

12

whether there are allowed a third crack at the examination

13

if they fail?

14

MR. DAANE:

Certainly.

Sometimes they are.

15

again, it is not the product of an automatic right.

16

is the point I wish to emphasize.

17

But,
That

The other point about that which I wish to emphasize

18

is that when Mr. Ewing took the examination for the first

19

time, he had been warned and he understood the warning that

20

he had received, that one more deficiency would be cause

21

for his termination.

22

So, I suggest to the Court that if there is to

23

be a rule in this case, that is what it is, one more

24

deficiency and you are out.

25

QUESTION:

When you refer to that warning, are

you referring to the warning on page 146 that you called

2

our attention to once before?

3

MR. DAANE:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Stevens.
It really doesn't quite say that.

5

It says it will be grounds for dismissal.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16
17

Very well.

MR. CONWAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

18

The issue in this case is whether the Regents

19

must abide by their own procedures and rules which they

20

have publicly promulgated to students to rely upon.

21

The Regents were free in the first instance in

22

their sole discretion to establish whatever standards, rules

23

of procedures they wanted to measure academic performance,

24

including Ewing's performance, but having set the rules

25

to govern this important relationship between institution

it is a matter of state law that a student is not to be

arbitrarily dismissed, in that case from a medical school.

In this instance — The crucial thing that makes

12

this case so unique is that the violation of the rule resulted

13

in the deprivation of the property interest; that is his

cismissal.

QUESTION:

Those are the findings

In the petition, the Regents have not suggested

19

that the Sixth Circuit applied purely an erroneous standard

20

in some different fashion, haven't cited any error in that

21

regard.

22

So, the factual predicate that the legal issue

23

arises on here is the Sixth Circuit's finding that there

24

was a rule, it applied to Ewing, that Ewing was qualified

25

within the meaning of the Regents' own standards, and that

he was dismissed despite that and his dismissal resulted

2

in the deprivation of his property interest to not be

3

arbitrarily dismissed.

4
5

QUESTION:

That is the record —

Mr. Conway, can I clarify one thing

in my own mind?

6

MR. CONWAY:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.
The property interest, as I understand

8

it under your presentation, is an interest in not being

9

dismissed from the school arbitrarily?

10

MR. CONWAY:

11

QUESTION:

12

Which conceptually at least is different

from a property right to retake an exam.

13

MR. CONWAY:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.
Do you contend there was a property

right to retake the exam, contract righ:?
MR. CONWAY:

The property interest that gives

17

rights to federal claim, if I could answer this way, Your

18

Honor, is his dismissal.

19

If a rule were violated, but as a result of that

20

violation of a rule there was no deprivation of property

21

without due process — For example, if Ewing were dismissed

22

because, after taking this exam, he went to a clinical course

23

where in fact he got an honors, but let's say he had done

24

something in the judgment of the faculty his performance

25

was so poor he should be dismissed for that, then there
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

would be no violation of his property interest because he

2

couldn't retake the exam because for some other reason he

3

wao dismissed.

4

The significance here is the combination of the

5

fact that the violation of the rule resulted in the

6

deprivation of the property interest.

7

He might have a contract claim under state law

8

if it were important enough and not a trivial matter, but

9

he wouldn't have a federal claim because what Michigan has

10

defined as his property interest is his dismissal, not some

11

right to take the exam.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CONWAY:

Is the property right the dismissal?
Yes.

Under the Booker case, cited

14

by the Sixth Circuit, the Michigan Supreme Court has held

15

there is a property right not to be arbitrarily dismissed.

16

Let me briefly address the Eleventh Amendment

17

issues.

18

thac was first raised in the rehearing.

19

I think there are three answers to that argument

The first is that the suit against the Regents

20

has always been considered by the Regents to be against

21

the Regents in their official capacity.

22
23
24
25

That can be shown

from the Joint Appendix where they argue that the money
damage claim was barred under Edelman v. Jordan, but said
to the District Court you can enter an injunctive relief
against us.

That is somebody who thinks the suit is against
41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the officials in their official capacity.
Secondly, we have filed, Justice O'Connor, a motion

2

3

to amend under the teachings of Brandon v. Holt where an

4

amendment was permitted even though no motion had been filed.

5

And, there is no prejudice shown here.

There

6

has been no objection filed by the Regents.

7

Rule 15(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it is

8

appropriate to conform the evidence, to conform the pleadings

9

to the evidence.

10

And, under

Finally, under the Toll case in this Court, the

11

Regents waived any claim that they now belatedly assert,

12

because they told the District Court that they would be

13

liable for injunctive relief.

4

QUESTION:

Your position, I suppose, had the Regents

15

raised such a defense in the District Court, perhaps you

16

would have amended --

MR. DAANE:

May I just clarify that one point?

What was the reason for his dismissal from the school?
MR. DAANE:

It was the accumulated effect of his

Is the accumulation the fact that he

MR. DAANE:

It is the reason I devoted as much

time as I did at the outset of my argument, Justice Stevens,

Is that to be inferred from the record

as a whole or is there some document where that reason is

MR. DAANE:

or question, why didn't we let him take the test, and just

be done with it.

Give him a second chance, let him flunk

10

it, no law suit.

I think there are two good reasons, two

11

good answers to that question.

12

The first is that the medical faculty considers

13

it very important that its students display the ability

to perform in a timely way and to do the things they are

assigned under pressure.

that ability, in fact, quite the contrary.

But, the more significant and important answer

20

to that question is that our medical faculty feels very

21

keenly its obligation to the public to assure the public

22

that the holder of a M.D. degree from Michigan is a qualified

physician.

opinion back in 1982 concluded by holding that the University

6

was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity and that there

7

had been no waiver of that immunity. And the subsequent

opinion of the District Court addressed the substantive

9

issue in the case without deciding it on Eleventh Amendment

10

immunity.

11

The District Court's first

What is the explanation of that?
MR. DAANE:

Justice Powell, the motion was for

12

dismissal of Count Three of the Complaint which sought monetary

13

damages.

14

Feikens was filed before this Court's decision in Pennhurst.

15

Pennhurst changed all perception ind the Court's perception,

16

I think, of the scope of the Eleventh Amendment defense

17

as it applied to claims for injunctive relief against the

18

state.

19

The explanation is that the decision by Judge

It has been clear for some time that claims for

20

monetary relief were clearly barred, but claims for prospective

21

injunctive relief have been in an even much less clear area,

22

if I may say.

23

Pennhurst changed that with respect to claims

24

for injunctive relief against states to compel them to con­

25

form their conduct to state law.
