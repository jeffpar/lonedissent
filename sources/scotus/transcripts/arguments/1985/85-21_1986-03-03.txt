ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS V. RIGLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. RIGLER*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, the issue presented in this proceeding

11

is whether motor carriers who conspire in violation of

12

the antitrust laws, who violate their filed rate bureau

13

agreement, and who violate provisions of the Interstate

14

Commerce Act are immune fro» damage suits brought under

15

the antitrust laws by the victims of their illegal

16

conspiracy.

17

The petitioners here today are t.wo shippers

18

who brought suit in a class representative capacity with

19

respect to the transport of commodities ny motor freight

20

between points in the eastern and central United States

21

and the province of Ontario, Canada.

The respondents ace the Niagara Frontier

9

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals

10

reluctantly upheld the District Court, holding that the

11

task of overruling Keogh if it is to be overruled is for

12

this Court, but the Second Circuit expressed substantial

13

doubt that any of the basic rationale which necessitated

MR. RISLERs

18

QUESTION*

19

MR. RIGLERi

Yes, I am. Your Sonor.
Specifically?
Yes.

Keogh should be overruled

20

because the passage of the Reed-Bullwinkle Act and

21

subsequent decisions of this Court have rendered it

22

inapplicable under the clear repugnancy doctrine which

23

necessitated it in the original instance.

QUESTIONS

If we don't overrule Keogh.

2

MR. RICLERi

We ace not able to pursue our

3

damage claims.

We still have an action pending for

4

5

amend in the event there were claims outside cf the

6

Keogh doctrine/ but basically the answer is, yes, we do,

7

Mr. Justice Brennan.

8

The allegations of the complaint are to be

9

accepted as correct foe purposes of this proceeding.

10

Those allegations are that notwithstanding the fact that

11

they had a Bureau agreament on file at the ICC which

12

would have given these carriers antitrust exemption,

13

they organized a secret committee of principles or top

14

management executives,

15

fix prices, to engage in anticompetitive acts, and to

16

coerce other carriers Into withdrawing or withholding

17

independent rate filings which were lover and would have

18

had the effect of lowering the overall

19

structures.

So the allegations of ignoring

11

their own rate schedule are not essential to your

12

claims.

13

MR. RIGLER*

Well, what they ignored was the

14

method of fixing rates which was approved by the

15

Commission, and that is what they had statutory

16

authority to do.

17

an exemption given to them by Congress in express

18

antitrust immunity, instead,

19

that and to subvert the regulatory statute.

20

The evil is that instead of following

they chose to go around

Now, when they did that and filed rates in

21

which shippers were denied participation, and in which

22

shippers didn't realize that there were other carriers

23

out there willing to offer even lower rates, that

24

constituted a violation which is actionable under the

25

antitrust laws, and it is no longer safeguarded by the
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

express immunity which Congress granted in

2

Reed-B ullwinkle.

3

Neither is there any necessity for the implied

4

immunity which the Court granted so long ago in Keogh,

5

because now the basic tension between the Interstate

6

Commerce Act, which in 1922 permitted the ICC to approve

7

jointly proposed rates and the prohibition in the

8

Sherman Act which said companies should not get together

9

and fix rates and fix prices, that basic original

10

tension was resolved in 1948 whan Congress eliminated

11

the dilemma, and this Court repeatedly has held that

12

only a clear repugnancy between the antitrust laws and a

13

regulatory statute will permit even implied Immunity,

14

and that implied immunity is to be narrowly construed so

15

as to make the regulatory plan work.
Once the carriers had an opportunity to do

16
17

that and

went outside,

then their rates should be

18

subject to the ordinary application of the antitrust

19

laws, and notwithstanding that they were filed with the

20

Commission, and notwithstanding that thay became

21

effective 30 days after approval, without any action by

22

the Commission because the Commission simply no longer

23

has the resources to review these -- but even assuming

24

that they had done it, it wouldn’t have been a fair

25

review.

QUESTION*

Well, isn’t it possible under your

theory that a court or jury could afford damages on the

unlawful under the Interstate Commerce ftct?

10

HR. BIGLER*

11

QUESTION;

Highly unlikely.
It is certainly possible, though,

12

and it could subject carriers to very conflicting

13

standards with respect to filed rates, it seems to me.

14

HR. RIGLER*

I don’t believe so.

First of

15

all, the zone of reasonableness is extremely broad.

16

is highly unlikely that we would propose rates which

17

would run that risk.

18

on the respondent’s parts that the rates we propose are

19

below that zone of reasonableness, then and only then, I

suppose, the matter might be referred to the ICC, but I

believe that would be a very highly unusual situation.

complaints, and a consent decree was entered against

that conduct, so the question in the case is not whether

That has been true since the

In other words, whether there is adequate

reason why carriers who have violated both the

1

now
I would like to take those points in order, if

2
3

I may.

Very briefly, it is flatly incorrect to say that

4

the rates at issue in Keogh and Georgia were the product

5

or were made in compliance with the regulatory plan.

6

Those rates were the result of per se illegal naked

7

price fixing conspiracy and collusion that was not

8

approval by the Commission, that was beyond the power of

9

the Commission to approve and immunize.
The complaint in the Georgia case called those

10
11

wilfull violations, said they flouted ICC procedures,

12

they were outside of the express immunity contained in

13

certificate 44, which vas the wartime immunity, and the

14

Court recognized that government prosecutions would be

15

adequate to deal '>ith those kinds of illegal forms of

16

agreements because it would not interfere with the heart

17

of the Commission's discretion over rates.
But treble lamages would Lava the opposite

18
19

effect.

Treble damages as administered by the courts

20

would involve the courts in a forbidden pursuit, namely

21

deciding what rates other than the file rate would be

22

lawful, and that was a decision that Congress wanted the

23

Commission to make, and set up specific statutory

24

standards and procedures and remedies that were just

25

plain different from the standards and remedies and

procedures uniar the antitrust laws.
So, it is wrong to say that our position is

3

not based on the plain language of the statute.

4

statute defines specifically what rate it is that a

5

shipper is entitled to, and it is a just and reasonable

6

and noniiscriminatory rate.

7

just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate.

8

not the lowest reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate.

9

It is just what it says, and there is no necessary

10

relationship between a violation of a Hate Bureau

11

procedure and whether that, rate is just and reasonable.

12

The

It is not the competitive
It is

That is an issue for the Commission to decide,

13

and in fact in the Wheat Sail case the Commission found

14

that even though there was a Rate Bureau violation,

15

there had not been injury caused to the shipper, and the

16

Commission refused to retroactively nullify or abrogate

17

that rate, and that decision by the Commission was cited

18

with approval by this Court in the flTA decision when it

19

upheld a new administrative remedy for shippers to

redress Bate Bureau violations and to receive what this

Court thought was potentially ruinous.

Commerce Commission, so that would satisfy your

2

concern.

3

MR. FLEXNERi

Well,

Justice O’Connor, there is

4

no statutory provision that authorizes that procedure.

5

This Court has three times, if I remember correctly,

6

considered the question of a referral of complicated

7

rate issues in a situation where a plaintiff is trying

8

to create a cause of action in court that Congress had

9

not itself authorized, and on those occasions, in Keogh

10

itself, in 1951, in Montana-Dakota, and in 1959 in this

11

Court’s decision in the T.I.M.E. case, the Court found

12

that the issue is one of legislative intent, not — and

13

refused to allow a procedure to be gerryriggad in order

14

to create a cause of action that Congress had decided it

15

wanted to rest exclusively with the agency.

16
17
18

And, Your Honor, I must say that this case
shows what a mess —
QJESTIONi

Bat there is nothing inherently

19

existing in the statutory framework, is there, to

20

prevent a court from referring the question to the ICC?

21

MR. FLEXNERt

Justice O’Connor, I think there

22

is an issue as to whether or not it is congruent with

23

what Congress wanted the Commission to do.

24

said there is a two-year period within which you can

25

consider it, whether rates are lawful or unlawful under

referral.

This casa involves 16 years.

cases out there. Justice O'Connor, that involve 25 or 30

5

years.

6

which would be such a mess for the courts and would

7

leave so many unanswered questions in terms of where cur

8

appeal rights were, were they from the Commission

decision, was the Commission's decision advisory, do we

So I think we are talking about a procedure

10

submit it to the jury, do we argue contrary facts to the

11

jury, do we appeal from the jury verdict?

12

None of those questions have been addressed by

13

this Court, and certainly they have not been addressed

14

by the Congress, and we think that in a statute which is

15

supposed to provide certain continuity, and where

16

Congress has clearly laid out a map or a guidepost for

17

remedies, and where this Court has refused to authorize

18

this kind of a detailed raferraL procedure on rates,

19

this would be a bad case to do that.

they allege here, in June of 1983, when they brought

is that under the new Sct, the Motor Carrier Act, under

nullification authority, perhaps they could nullify

tariffs that were in effect in taking the rate back to

the preexisting level, but the point is that Congress

The lower courts that have looked at this

shows that Congress did not intend to overrule Keogh,

all was intended to protect the rate authority of the

Commission and those special powers as the process by

23

which rates got set, and there was no reason therefore

for Congress to want to overrule a statutory

— there would be no

8

of the statute defined what rate is legal and what the

shipper is entitled to, and the Commission and the

10

courts are bound by that plain language, and in fact

when the petitioners gat up and they say we would like

12

to put an expert on the stand who is going to testify

that there was a competitive rate out here that would

have been charged but

clear that with respect to rate levels and whether

particular rates that arise out of what we have been

calling a procedural violation violate the Act because

14

they are unreasonable or discriminatory, that is a

matter that can only be decided by the Commission

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL
MR. RIGLER;

2

The Court just hear! Mr. Flexner

3

tell it, that if wrongdoers can violate the antitrust

4

laws and the Interstate Conferee Act and get away with

5

it by concealing a conspiracy for a long period of time,

6

they get to pocket the money,

7

enriched, and the people who were victimized should lose

8

that money, and he tells you that that is what Congress

9

had in mind when it passed the Reed-Bullwiakle Act which

they should be unjustly

10

gave them an express antitrust immunity.

11

the face of the implied immunity doctrine.

That flies in

The implied immunity doctrine is a narrow

12
13

doctrine.

It is a limited exception to a broad national

14

policy of open price competition, and where Congress

15

grants express immunity, the implied immunity doctrine

16

no longer applies.

17

Do you think that the

18

considerations expressed by Judge Friendly aid to seme

I think that Congress believed
