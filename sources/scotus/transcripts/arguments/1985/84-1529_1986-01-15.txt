The Court will hear

MR.

COOPER*

Thank

Mr.

Chief Justice,

may it please the Court*
The question in this case is whether Section

11

504 of the Rehabilitation

Act of 1973 prohibits a

12

federally assisted hospital from withholding nourishment

13

or medically benefirial treatment from a handicapped

14

infant solely because of that individual's handicap.

non-discriminatory mandate in this setting.

2

How, there is no guestion presented in this

3

case concerning the application of Section 504 to any

4

particular set of facts or circumstances.

5

case concerns only the facial validity of the

6

Secretary’s regulation.

7

the Court of Appeals was clearly incorrect in concluding

8

that all handicapped individuals who are infants are as

9

a matter of law outside the scope of Section 504

10

protection insofar as furnishing nourishment and

11

lifesaving medically beneficial treatment are

12

concerned.

Therefore,

How, as I shall explain, the language of

Section 504 plainly prohibits a federally assisted

16

hospital program from discriminating on the basis of

17

handicap is this, as well as in any other context

18

concerning a covered federally funded health services

19

program.
And, contrary to the Respondents* claims,

20
21

there is firm support for this position at every stage

22

of Section 504’s evolution, from its origins in Title 6

23

of the

24

1973 and its amendments in 1974 and 1978.

Turning first to tne text of the Act, Section

4

504 provides in pertinent part as follows*

11

as one member of this Court described the almost

12

identical language of Title 6 of the

13

Act, which was the model for Section 504.

14

Court also noted in tie 3ro/e City case recently that it

1

Section 504, that they have physical and mental

2

impainants that linit major life activities, which is

3

the statutory definition of what a handicapped

4

individual is.

5

The court also noted,

and we certainly concur,

6

that to say otherwise defies common sense.

8

to all individuals without respect to their age.

9

Indeed, this

The Court of Appeals below did conclude,

10

however, that handicapped individuals are not otherwise

11

qualified, which is also a requirement of Section 504,

12

and that was a requirement that this Court scutinized

13

very closely in Southeastern Community College against

14

Davis, and there it held that ait otherwise qualified

15

handicapped individual is someone who is able to meet

16

all of the requirements of the program in spite of his

17

handicap.

18

Now, the requirement in Section 504 that a

19

handicapped person be otherwise qualified simply

20

reflects a Congressional recognition that a handicapping

21

condition may be relevant, a relevant consideration. In

22

some contexts, and that when it is relevant 504 doesn't

23

require that it be ignored.

24
25

Thus, in the Davis case the ability to
communicate effectively was very relevant to whether or

not a person could function properly in a nursing

2

training program, and the ability to communicate

3

effectively was a legitimate requirement of that

4

training program, and therefore a deaf person who could

5

not meet that neutral requirement was net admitted and

6

504 lid not require a different result.

In the context of medical care,

24

the treatment be administered.

25

But when a patient Is denied treatment that is

QUESTION!

7

Nr. Cooper, is it true that the

8

administrative record doesn't have any examples in it of

9

a hospital which has refused to treat a handicapped

10

infant when the parents have consented to treatment?
MR. COOPER*

11
12

I believe that is accurate.

I

believe there is no —
QUESTION*

13

So what you're really concerned

14

about and what the record supports, I suppose, is cases

15

when the parents have refused to give consent to

16

treatment?
MF.

17

COOPER*

That is the circumstance which

18

creates the problem that these regulations are design ad

19

to address, that is certainly true, but —

not?

These are guidelines, are they

There are procedural rules.

They’ve been adopted in accordance

with the Administrative Procedures Act?
MR. COOPER*

5

Yes, yes.

They have been put out

6

for comment, and in fact some extremely extensive

7

comments were received, and throughout the regulatory

8

history of this matter the thinking of the Secretary of

9

HHS has benefited quite a bit from the comment period

10

and from the regulatory process.
But the regulations themselves include

11
12

procedural requirements —

The posting of a notice and the

right to get records.

That's right, expedited access to

QUESTION*

17

And the real focus actually is on

18

situations where parents, have refused to give consent to

19

treatment, and in that context would you explain how the

20

regulations operate and how you see the application of

21

the Act?

22

MR. COOPER*

Yes.

In the context where the

23

parents have refused to consent to a medically indicated

24

treatment, the hospital is put to a decision, typically,

25

and that is how do they respond to that.

Obviously,

QUESTION;

3

Well, .it's also the case where the

doctor agrees with the parents, isn't it?
MR.

4

COOPER*

That may or may not be true, but

5

certainly in some of the examples that are available the

6

doctor and the parents are in agreement with respect to

7

withholding a particular treatment, yes.
QUESTION;

8
9

Well, you can tell us about both of

those situations, then.
QUESTION;

10

And tell us, if you will, whether

11

you think that under the statute the child is otherwise

12

qualified for treatment when the parent has refused to

13

give consent and therefore it would be a battery for the

14

doctor or the hospital to give treatment.
MS. COOPER*

15

It would certainly be a battery,

16

Justice O'Connor, unless the parents' refusal to give

17

consent was overridden by operation of state law and if

18

— and this is not uncommon in the care of infants,

19

newborns.

20

hospitals are faced with the responsibility essentially

21

to seek to override parents'

of nourishment itself.

and that is clearly beneficial, about which, you know,

3

there's no medical iirference of opinion that it's

beneficial, that it's medically indicated, but the

parents nonetheless will refuse the treatment.

6

In that context, hospitals and child

8

we have child protective agencies in the states -- will

intervene and review the parents' decision, and if it is

(202) 628-9300

what

1

Respondents essentially seek from this Court is an

2

exemption from the application of the statute, an

3

exemption that permits them to make decisions that are

4

based not only on handicap, but that are outside of the

5

scope of professional medical judgment.
In the context again of a handicapped infant

6
7

whose parents have refused to consent to treatment, the

8

analytical mode is to different than if the refusal was

9

based on religious scruples and the doctor happened to

10

be the same religion and concurred in that judgment.

11

Under those circumstances, hospitals, at least hospitals

12

that became aware of the coarse of treatment or

13

non-treatment that was agreed upon, would typically

14

under state law be required to petition a court for

15

review of that kind of derision.

would follow,

for is now whether there's been a valid reason so much

COOPERi

Oh, yes, Justice Stevens, there

are.

The administrative record and the preamble to the

regulations, which is contained in the joint appendix,

4

as well as very recently the hearings in Congress in

5

connection with the amendments to the 1984 Child Abuse

basis to the concerns in this area and legislated in a

8

way that requires state child protective agencies to

have procedures in place in order to receive complaints

or allegations that someone is being denied treatment

because of his handicap, and also to ensure that all of

the mechanisms of state law are entirely available to

There is testimony certainly in

that administrative record, comments, as well as a host

of studies by professionals in the field themselves

Marshall,

to your guestion, the regulations do reflect a

19

very sensitive regard for the role of the state in this

20

respect, and in fact one of the key features of those

21

regulations is to encourage hospitals, federally funded

hospitals, to set up infant care review committees, so

that decisions of this kind can routinely be looked at

10

NR. COOPER*

Justice Marshall, certainly it is

11

true that until Section 504 was passed there was no

12

foundation whatever for the Federal Government to

13

inquire in any way into these kinds of decisions, except

14

to the extent perhaps that i decision in a state

15

hospital might be unconstitutional, relying on this

Court's recent ruling in the Cleveland County case.

17

that's another matter entirely.

But

The whole point is the 504, and in 1973 when

19

it was passed, is tie first occasion for the Federal

Government's inquiry into this,

role at all inquiring into whether or not health

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

The first is that a decision to withhold

medical treatment in a specific individual case, while

11

it may constitute unlawful medical neglect at its worst

12

under the laws of all of the states,

14

Rehabilitation Act.

15

view of discrimination, concerns the disparate treatment

16

of people according to categories or classifications,

17

such as race and sex and age.

18

decisions do not constitute disparate treatment by

19

category, but rather are based on the medical treatment

needs of the individual, and

QUESTION;

Sell, Nr. Heinemaa, it does strike

me that the Respondents in this case just aren't coming

to grips with what night be of real concern to us, and

12

that is the breadth of the language, the fact that

13

there’s nothing in the legislative history that

expressly says Congress did not intend to cover this

area, and the fact that we normally defer to the

16

administrative agency's interpretation.

3

the responsibility of the provider?

4

In 1982 when the notice was first put out on

5

this subject, they said the responsibility of the

6

provider was to discharge the infant from the hospital.

7

There was an outcry about this, because that would

8

obviously be inhumane and incorrect.

9

In 1983 when they put.out an interim final

10

regulation, they sail

the responsibility of the provider

11

was to override the treatment decision of the parents

12

and provide treatment, neglecting the fact that, as I

13

think Justice O’Connor pointed out, that would of course

14

be a battery.

15

So by the time they got to put out the final

16

reg, they then go to this question of whether they can

17

investigate whether providers are discharging their

QUESTION;

Mr. Cooper indicated that the

3

administrative record shows that there was a substantial

4

problem of non-reporting of cases in this category, as

5

opposed to other cases.

6

MR.

HEINEMAN:

Do you agree with that?
I Jisagrea with that.

Shat is

7

in the record are some old studies, at least eight to

8

ten years old, discussing physician attitudes, not

9

specific cases, and never addressing the question of

10

whether the state child abuse and neglect system was

11

functioning correctly.

12

Those are strictly attitudinal studies of

13

physicians.

They ace not real cases, and they do not

14

address the fundamental question of whether or not the

15

state system is not functioning correctly.

16

But in any event, there is a fundamental rule

17

cf construction here that, where the Federal Government

18

is coming in to enforce state law — in other words

19

what the Federal Government is purporting to do who it

20

comes into these hospitals is to see if the providers

21

are discharging their state law duties, duties

22

established under child abuse and neglect statutes by

23

state law to report.

24
25

They are seeking to enforce those duties, to
see if there is in fact liability.

when 504 was enacted in 1973 it was aimed at employment

and education, and that there was — Congress made
