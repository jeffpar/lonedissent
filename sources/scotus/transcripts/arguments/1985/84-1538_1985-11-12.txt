OR AI ARGUMENT OF JON SMOCK, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS - RESUMED

7
8
9

MR. SMOCK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Throughout these proceedings, Berkeley has

10

never explained why price-fixing by a municipality is

11

any less intrusive upon competition in the marketplace,

12

and Berkeley has never suggested any limits to its

13

assumed authority to fix prices.

14

QUESTION;

Me. Smock, you said just before

15

lunch that,

16

the city of Berkeley relied upon had been passed after

17

the city of Berkeley's ordinance, it was no good.

18

you say thai the state could never ratify something that

19

a municipality had done?

20

since whatever California legislation that

MR. SMOCK:

Do

Net at all, Justice Fehnguist.

I

21

believe it entirely competent for the state of Berkeley

22

net only to ratify action, but tc adopt a comprehensive

23

rent control anticompetitive scheme if it so desired.

24

But in the language of this Court, that legislation

25

would require clear articulation and affirmative

expression of an intent on the part of the legislature

2

to substitute a regulatory scheme for our competitive

3

policy.

4

And because of comity, Congress recognizes the

5

ability of states to engage in economic regulation.

6

as this Court said in Lafayette, you cannot tolerate and

7

the Congress has not recognized the ability of

8

60,000-plus units of local government scattered across

9

the country to substitute their judgment for that of the

10
11

Congress and that of the sovereign states.
The cities are not themselves sovereign, and

12

Congress has never granted to cities — indeed, just

13

last year it denied cities the very exemption which

14

Berkeley seeks here.

15

Eut

So I do not in the slightest suggest that it

16

would not be competent for California to adept a

17

regulatory scheme, or indeed to ratify past schemes, but

18

it has not done so.

19

position of strict and precise neutrality, and the

20

statutory scheme relied upon by Ferkeley here says in

21

its own statutory Section 65589(b) of the Government

22

Code that nothing in that article is intended to

23

authorize or repeal any authority that may exist for

24

local governments to engage in rent control.

25

It has instead maintained a

QUESTION

Mr. Smock, if the Court were to

10

employ a preemption analysis and look for proof that the

11

city ordinance violated the antitrust laws, where is the

12

conspiracy in your view?

13

MR. SMOCKs

Justice G'Ccnncr, we telieve that

14

the conspiracy here is exactly the same as that

15

recognized by this Court in the !'idca 1 case.

have is a local ordinance.

17

had a state statute, but here you have a local ordinance

18

that vertically imposes upon owners of rental property

19

in California -- in Berkeley, California, a duty to

20

follow the mandates of that ordinance.

21

QUESTIONS

Shat you

In Midcal, of course, you

In that sense, if you're right it

22

would seem to me that any governmental action would of

theory.

an irresistable pressure upon these who are compelled by

that law to coalesce in a horizontal combination to

maintain prices at the level fixed by the vertical

If we didn't agree with you on

Section 1, would we have to address your Section 2 claim

9

MR. SMOCK;

With all due respect,

I don't

10

believe that the Court is compelled to address any of

11

our claims, although we do think

12

reject our Section 1 claim that it would be an

13

appropriate case for an inquiry into the Section 2

14

issue, because in our judgment Berkeley is substituting

15

the owners’ pocketbooks for government's pocketbooks,

16

because the city of Berkeley is clearly engaged in the

17

provision of housing in the public sector and we believe

18

that th-Lt constitutes —

19

21

QUESTION;

that if you were to

is a competitor and a monopolist?
MR. SMOCK:

It is a provider of housing and,

22

while it may well be a competitor, it is approaching or

23

could approach a monopolistic position in the market

24

were it to succeed in its long-term goal of depressing

25

housing prices in th= city of Berkeley and, as suggested

1

by a pamphlet circulated in Berkeley that formed

2

something of the cornerstone for Berkeley's rent control

3

activities by that depression in the market prices would

4

be at such levels as cities could then condemn the

5

property and take over that property at prices lower

6

than market price.

7

And in that sense, one could impute to

8

Berkeley an intent to engage in monopolistic conduct.

9

don't think that on this record and on what we have

10

presented that that is a necessary result, but it is

11

certainly one that is conceivable in the confines of

12

this case.

13
14

QUESTIONS

NR. SMOCKs

That's absolutely correct. Justice

White.

17
18

Your preemption argument then is

that Berkeley orders what the Sherman Act forbids?

15
16

QUESTIONS

And you call that a preemption

argument?

19

HP. SNOCKi

20

QUESTIONS

Yes.
But anyway, part of it is that we

21

must say that what the ordinance orders the Sherman Act

22

forbids ?

23

NR. SNOCKs

24

QUESTIONS

25

That is precisely correct.

Whether it be

didn't have to hold that that would violate the Sherman

Act.

10

Just all we hai to hold

that it was or wasn't

immune from challenge under the Sherman Act.

11

MR. SMOCK*

And that the state law was

12

preempted by the federal law because of the overriding

13

federal policy which is obstructed by that state law.

14
15

QUESTION*

Do you have to find that there is u

violation before you can find a preemption?

16

MR. SMOCK*

We do not believe so, but if

17

violation were necessary then we believe violation is

18

shown in this case, for the very reason that you found

in deciding

2

antitrust violation, then I think that that action would

3

be successful.

4

QUESTIONS

But are there circumstances in

5

which that action would not be successful and still a

6

court could properly say that the Berkeley ordinance is

7

preempted or in some way forbidden by the antitrust

8

laws ?

9

SR. SUOCKs

Yes, and that’s this action.

This

10

action raises the issue in a preemption concept because

11

it is an action coming from a state court,

12

obviously does not have antitrust liability

13

jurisdiction.

14

which

But a state court is fully competent to

15

determine the conflict between a local ordinance and

16

state and federal law.

17

competent to determine that conflict without finding all

18

of the requisites that might be necessary to find a

19

Sherman Act violation.

20

And this Court is fully

We say again, if you should find that you must

21

find a violation, then we think that it’s also here.

22

ether words, preemption concepts do not require finding

23

all of the elements of a Sherman Act violation where you

24

have a violation of overriding federal policy, as

25

indicated in the Hines case, where a local ordinance or

I

would respectfully suggest, yes,

20

because the standard for conviction under a Sherman Act

22

by this Court with respect to competing policies, and

recognized as being a per se violation, if you will, cf

But whether called violation or preemption,

the real issue is whether Congress intended to proscribe

Hr. Tribe, if you say that it must

6

HR. TRIBE;

Justice White, in this Court's

7

opinion in Rice v. Williams, which came from the

8

California Court of Appeals, that issue was raised in

9

footnote 4 and it was observed that, although

the

10

California courts would not have jurisdiction

to

11

entertain a lawsuit brought to enforce the Sherman Act,

12

nonetheless when the remedy sought under the supremacy

13

clause is declaratory or injunctive, it is appropriate

14

tc ask whether because of direct conflict with the

15

mandate of the Sherman Act there is preemption.
t

16

And indeed, it was in that opinion and for

17

this Court that Justice Eehnquist suggested that a

18

facial attack upon a law for conflict with the Sherman

19

Act, because of the breadth of its pro-competitive

20

goals, requires more than a showing that there's

21

something anti-competitive about the measure.

22

requires a showing that there is in fact a direct

23

violation, though the remedial powers of the state

24

courts would be limited.

But contrast that with Midcal.

(.102) 628-9300

That

is,

1

competition by requiring that they charge at least as

2

much as the prices of the ordinary theaters.

3

That would be preempted.

It wculd be a

4

combination in restraint of trade, and it couldn't be

5

ratified even by state legislation because, although the

6

state is exempt, it cannot, as this Court held in

7

Schwegman and Gcldfarb and Midcal, give a green light to

8

private combinations.

9

And when we are told by Mr. Smock that that's

10

what this law dees because it places, as he put it,

11

irresistable pressure on landlords to coalesce and

12

combine, then we suppose that he's talking

explicit:

"It should be noted that the ruling in

for the broader proposition that private persons and

purposes of antitrust analysis."

We

21

merely argue that when this Court in Boulder levered the

22

shield of state action exemption from municipalities it

23

should not therefore be deemed also to have given their

opponents the kind of blunderbuss ammunition that is

25

unavailable even against private wrongdoers.

That is,

1

General Motors or IT£T are free to order their economic

2

affairs so long as they do not violate the antitrust

3

laws .

4

The suggestion that cities should be less

5

free, should always have to act only with competition in

6

mind, despite their very different public purposes, we

7

think is untenable.

8

And indeed, if I might turn to Boulder itself,

9

this Court in Boulder said that it was holding only that

10

the state's subdivisions in exercising their delegated

11

power must obey the antitrust laws, not that they must

12

always put competition in a market, however

13

exploitative, however incapable of meeting the diverse

14

housing needs of the people, above all other goals.

15

Now, apart from the decisive absence of any

16

combination or monopolization and therefore any Section'

17

1 or Section 2 violation of the threshold, we do

18

elaborate in our brief the further argument, to which I

19

haven't heard'any response by Mr. Smock — I think it's

20

a rather important argument -- the argument that even if

21

there were the requisite combination or even if that

22

were deemed merely a technicality that this Court could

23

somehow overlook, the usual per se rule for private

24

price-fixing is inappropriate in dealing with local

25

government regulation of the economy, as the California

Supreme Court held
The reason quite simply is, as this Court

3

recognized in Town of Hallie,

4

private enterprise will be modified, will be motivated

5

by private profit and not by the public good is

6

inappropriate in dealing with municipalities.

7

the assumption that

The situation of municipal action is

8

qualitatively different, and this Court has repeatedly

9

said, all the way back in White Motor in 1963 and as

10

recently as Northwest Stationers just this year, that

11

one cannot mechanically extrapolate per se rules just by

12

using seemingly similar labels.

13

Now, if I*m right that the existing per se

14

rule about private price-fixing is unavailable to

15

mechanically strike down this kind of ordinance, then

16

there's a very important implication.

17

is one cannot strike it down on its fac?.

18

The implication

As this Court held in Bice v.

Williams, to

19

strike down a law on its face under the antitrust laws,

20

despite all the myriad applications it might have,

21

needs to have a clear anough per se rule to be able to

22

say that in all of its applications with confidence its

23

anticompetitive effects will net be justified by the

24

legitimate range of benefits one might consider.

25

What that in turn means is that it’s only

after a series of as-applied attacks to laws of this

kind that it would be appropriate to formulate the per

3

se rule without which facial invalidation is

4

unacceptable.

5

Now, such as-applied attacks might occur.

I

6

trust that if this Court reaffirms Boulder, says that

7

there is no blanket exemption for municipalities, it

8

will nonetheless have room, as the Fifth Circuit did in

9

the Affiliated Capital Corporations case involving

10

favoritism to certain cable companies, friends of the

11

mayor, it will have room to entertain case by case

12

particular instances of anticompetitive municipal

13

behavior.

14

And after a time one might formulate for those

15

situations appropriate per se rules, let's say a rule

16

requiring competitive bidding across a broad range of

17

cases, but only after a series of as-applied

18

challenges.

19

only a challenge bereft of conspiracy, but a challenge

20

bereft of any showing of unreasonableness.

21

We have here a facial challenge that is not

But it seems to us that the judgment below

22

must in any event, even if we were wrong completely

23

about conspiracy and wrong about the per se rules,

24

must in any event be affirmed, because the city of

in no sense serving a purely parochial interest cf its

own in passing this ordinance.

Of course it is concerned with its own

citizens, with the aged, with

disabled, with people who might otherwise be

6

vindictively evicted from their apartments.

7

concerned, as it said in the very preamble to the

8

ordinance, it*s concerned with these things in order to

9

discharge its duty under state law to make sure that

10

every segment of the community is adequately housed.

11

Now,

students, with the

Put it is

I think this Court was misled by ?r.

12

Smock when he said that that duty was created in 1980.

13

Surely, as Justice Rehnquist suggests, even if it was it

14

would be competent for the legislature to ratify

15

retrospectively what the city had dona.

16

But the fact is that the relevant language

17

giving every municipality in California an obligation

18

somehow adequately to ensure that it., people are housed,

19

that language goes back to Section G53C2 of the

20

Government Code, enacted in 1967.

21

amended, but the critical language has not been

22

materially changed.

23

Now,

Tt*s been repeatedly

that’s five years before the original

24

version of this ordinance was passed in 1972,

25

that original version was passed in order to discharge

and when

1

this state-created obligation both houses of the

2

California legislature ratified what the city of

3

Berkeley had done in that earlier version of this law.

4

Now, it is said in the Appellants’ brief that

5

this Court should disregard that ratification because

6

the state legislatiure just did it absent-mindedly,

7

mechanically; they ratified everything.

8

principles of federalism mean that one cannot disregard

9

a legislative act of two houses of the state legislature

But surely

10

on the ground that it’s something that one would have

11

automatically expected.

In any event —

13

QUESTIONS

So this is basically a zoning

14

statute, though, talking about what kind of master plan

15

cities shall have?

16

MR. TRIBEs

Well, it’s a development and

17

housing requirement, and it’s somewhat ambiguous as to

18

the kinds of elements that must be included in the

19

so-called housing element of the plan.

20

But the legislature itself I think has made

21

clear it’s understanding of the breadth of this law,

22

because in 1980 when the law was again being considered,

23

it was considered at the same time as the California

24

electorate was being asked — and it was called

25

Proposition 10 — to cut back on the rent control power

of municipalities, power that the state's highest court

2

said that they had inherently under the home rule

3

authority as of 1976 when the Berkenfeld decision was

4

rendered.

5

So in 1980 the peop le of California are asked

6

in Prop 10 to take back that power.

7

10 was pending, the state leg islature, in passing

8

technical amendments to the p lanning provisions which as

of 1967 had imposed these dut ies upon the

Hallie.
That is, here, as in Town of Hallie, the city

3

of Berkeley is left free either to take this specific

4

kind of, if you want to call it, anticompetitive

5

measure, although we think its net impact on competition

6

has never been demonstrated, either it may take that

7

measure or, if it doesn’t, it must do something else to

8

assure that the housing need

9

of the people are met.

The foreseeability test of Town of Hallie does

10

not require that the state direct municipalities as to

11

the choice of means, and when the rent control method

12

was ratified by the legislature when first used in

13

when the state's highest court four years later said you

14

don't even need to ratify it because it’s one of the

15

general powers of a municipality, and when four years

16

later the state legislature acknowledges expressly that

17

this is one of the municipality's means by which it may

18

meet a state-created duty that goes all the way back to

19

1967, it seems to me entirely foreseeable and

state-authorized.

by itself, because that’s just like the Town cf Hallie.
MR. TRIBE;

That’s right, Berkenfeld by itself

24

wouldn’t do.

25

it shows complete foreseeability.

But the dramatic effect of the Appellants

2

argument is that not even explicit state authorization

3

would save local zoning, local rent control, local

economic regulation, if

5

after all, as they themselves point out, Schwegman and

6

Goldfarb and Midcal all were cases where there was

direct state authorization.

their theory were right, because

And if one could analyze as a vertical mandate

could analyze any economic regulation telling private

parties how to behave in the economy to an

12

irreconcilable and irresistable pressure to coalesce and

combine,

14

state authorization could save rent control, could save

15

any local control of the economy.

then it would follow that no amount of explicit

Nr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;

17

This Court has never in its 90-year history of

price-fixing.

20

this Court said in Maricopa, it is for the Congress to

21

make exceptions to that rule.

It has always looked to Congress.

Mr. Smock, have we ever held that
