CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments first

this morning in Witters against the Washington Department of

4

Services for the Blind.

5

Mr. Farris, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. FARRIS, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. FARRIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

This morning the Court has before it a Religion Clause

11

case involving a vocational rehabilitation program for the

12

blind.

13

It is important to note that it is a neutral program

14

and that it is broadly available to all blind citizens of the

15

State of Washington.

16

This is not an occasion where the State of Washington's

17

legislature has attempted to subterfuge the decisions of this

18

Court and go around and find a clever way to get state aid

19

through religious schools.

20

claimed that'it is not really aid to individuals, but is a

21

transparent fiction of aid to religious schools.

22

QUESTION:

Nor is this case where it can be

Mr. Farris, before you proceed, has Mr.

Witters completed his training for the ministry?
MR. FARRIS:

No, Your Honor, he wus required to drop

out because of lack of financial ability.

QUESTION:

I see.

2

QUESTION:

Well, was he an undergraduate or a graduate

3

student?
MR. FARRIS:

4

He was in Bible School which was leading

5

to a B.A. Degree, which was an undergraduate program, which

6

would have qualified him by itself for certain ministerial

7

positions.

QUESTION:

pursue his education for the ministry under this State of Wash­
ington program?
MR. FARRIS:

That is correct, Your Honor.

It is

his desire to return to the program and to finish his education.
QUESTION:

14

degree at the moment?

15

MR. FARRIS:

16

I take it if he were eligible he would

Is he pursuing some other educational

No, Your Honor, he is washing dishes

in a medical laboratory.

17

_t is our position in this case that there is no

18

justification under the Establishment Clause to single out

19

ministerial students for exclusion from participation in a

20

broad government program.

21

22
23

We would also argue that the Free Exercise Clause
indeed forbids such exclusion.
The guiding principle that this Court has used in

24

its Religion Clause cases is the principle of religious

25

neutrality and we think that the government does not have to
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

discriminate against religious persons in order to prove how

2

neutral it is.
Ministerial students do no have to be quarantined

3
4

from the access to public benefits nor to demonstrate that

5

the church is committed to a course of religious — or the

6

state is committed to a course of religious neutrality.

7

On the first half of our argument, we will deal with

8

the Establishment Clause and we must deal both with the position

9

of the State Supreme Court and the State Department of the

10

Blind, because the state — Department, although they support

11

the result below, they have switched positions and now have

12

abandoned the reasoning below and are making a new line of

13

argument.

14

First, we will deal with the State Supreme Court.
That Court held that flatly the government may never

15

fund the training of ministers.

16

is, of course, that it endangers not only this federal program

17

buc the G.I. Bill, Social Security recipients who use their

18

benefits to train for the ministry, and programs like the

19

Federally Insured Student Loan Program.

20
21

22

QUESTION:
you explain that?

Now, the problem with this

How does the Social Security — Would
How does that get in the picture?

MR. FARRIS:

If a person's father, for example, passes

23

away while they are going to college, they would be eligible

24

for certain dependent's benefits undei «-he Social Security

25

program which they could use for various forms of training,
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

including ministerial training among others.
QUESTION:

They could use it to start a filling station

3

too if they wanted, couldn't they?

4

they could do.

5

MR. FARRIS:

There is no limit on what

The benefits that I was referring to

6

were educational benefits that you are entitled to as a student

7

under certain Social Security programs.

8
9

The position of the State Supreme Court, we contend,
is not in accordance with this Court's rulings.

This Court

10

has never struck down a neutral program that is broadly available

11

to all citizens.

12

is not readily subject to an Establishment Clause

13

This Court has indeed said that such a program
challenge.

The State Supreme Court held that the primary effect

14

of the aid to Witters was to advance religion.

15

in this analysis is that they looked solely at Witters, rather

16

than looking at the primary effect of the entire program.

17

Now, the error

It is our contention that the proper judge of the

18

primary effect prong of the Court's tripartite test under Lemon

19

versus Kurtzman — They should have looked at the entire program,

20

not simply the aid of Witters.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Farris, do you concede that the State

22

of Washington could, if they chose, have a vocational rehabili­

23

tation program which expressly excludes any educational funding

24

for the ministry?

25

MR. FARRIS:

We would concede, Your Honor, that this

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

would be a much more difficult case here.

2

that —

3

QUESTION:

We would think

Well, do you think it would be valid under

4

the Establishment Clause for the state to have such an express

5

provision?

6
7

MR. FARRIS:
Clause.

8
9
10

It would be valid under the Establishment

The problem would be with the Free Exercise Clause.
QUESTION:

Would it be valid under the Free Exercise

Clause?
MR. FARRIS:

I don't believe that it would under

11

this Court's holdings in Sherbert and Thomas.

12

such an express exclusion for religious persons only would

13

run counter to that, but that is a more difficult case to —

14

QUESTION:

I think that

So, it is your position that if the state

15

wants to fund educational aid for students, it must include

16

educational aid for religious students of study.

17

MR. FARRIS:

I think there is a difference between

18

educational aid perhaps and vocational rehabilitation which

19

is career training.

20

under the State of Washington's law, this comes under the Public

21

Assistance Code, not the Education Code.

This is job placement kind of aid and

22

And, this Court's ruling —

23

QUESTION:

24

2b

Should it matter what code the legislature

enacts it under for a constitutional inquiry?
MR. FARRIS:

It shouldn't, but this Court's decisions
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

seem to have treated various sections differently.

2

and Thomas stand as examples of public assistance benefits

3

which have overturned exclusions based on religion.
QUESTION:

4

Sherbert

It just seems to me that your argument

5

would lead inevitably to conclude that a state could not

6

withhold funding for religious education at any level and in

7

any program.

8
9

MR. FARRIS:

I don't think that we are required to

go that far, Your Honor.

That, perhaps, is our position.

10

But, this Court's position, as it has said many times, to draw

11

lines and we think that there is no occasion to say that the

12

line should be drawn on the other side of this case Lo exclude

13

Mr. Witters from participation.

14

We would —

15

QUESTION:

16

education before?

17
18
19

Has this Court ever funded religious

MR. FARRIS:
funds.

No, this Court does not appropriate

That is the job of the legislature.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't mean that, of course, obviously

20

Has it ever approved the funding of religious education in

21

any decided case heretofore?

22

MR. FARRIS:

Yes, Your Honor, it has.

In the case

23

of Everson versus the Board, this Court held that the education

24

in that case was pervasively religious snd it was the central

25

mission of the Catholic church in that case in particular
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

to religiously educate their children.

2

education.

That is religious

And, this Court permitted an indirect benefit to

3
4

that education in the form of transportation benefits.

5

many other cases, the aid to religion cases that this Court

6

have held have often times involved institutions that

7

admittedly were giving religious education in.

8

of indirect state aid of those religious institutions have

9

been permitted by this Court in a number of instances.

10

QUESTION:

In

Various forms

Mr. Farris, does Mr. Witters urge that

4

11

his religious beliefs and practices require him to study

12

theology?

13

MR. FARRIS:

Your Honor, his position is that he

14

feel» a religious call to the ministry, much as ReV. McDan±ed

15

did in the case of McDaniel versus Paty, and that is a personal

16

religious call, it is not something the belief system per se

17

requires.

18

God as he perceives it.

It is more of a private direction between him and

19

QUESTION:

20

various wars we have been in?

21

by Congress on what studies the veterans could pursue?

22

MR. FARRIS:

What about veterans' benefits after the

No.

Are there any limitations placed

All parties in this case, including

23

Respondent and the Solicitor General's office, concede that

24

the G.I. Bill has been used for decades to allow persons to

25

train for the ministry, including a number of seminaries and
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

rabbinical schools that are eligible currently for the use

2

of such G.I. benefits.

3
4

It is our argument today that this case is
constitutionally indistinguishable from such a program.

5

Now, the state, Department for the Blind's position,

6

their new position that they have switched from, is based,

7

first of all, on arguments that are outside the record and

8

facts that are outside the record.

9

are attacking for the first time in this Court the consti­

They, among other things,

10

tutionality of the entire federal program, although that issue

11

was never raised in any court below and neither was the fact

12

to give some potential relevancy to this federal program

13

introduced below and that is this is the federal program in

14

question.

15

the Petitioner has no knowledge of whether that is true or

16

not.

17

There is no factual proof of that and counsel for

In any event, these new arguments and these new faJts

18

are very easily answered.

19

in question require the state, according to their argument,

20

to evaluate, to counsel, and to approve the program of the

21

blind individual who comes into participation in the vocational

22

rehabilitation scheme.

23

The federal statutes and regulations

This can be done, we would contend, objectively.

24

In fact, the statutes ard the regulations in contest require

25

objectivity.

29 U.S.C. Section 722(b)(4) that is in the
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Appendix of the Respondent's brief, requires objective criteria

2

in an evaluation procedure.

3

361.33(b) lists those objective criteria such as educational

4

achievement and work experience.

And 34 Code of Federal Regulations,

5

There is nothing in this record before this Court

6

to give rise to any basis for speculating as to the way the

7

actual program works under the federal guidelines; that there

8

is some violation under the imprimatur test or the excessive

9

entanglement test.

10

They simply would be speculation on the part of

11

Respondent that would even get us into these questions and

12

there is nothing in the record to support such speculation.

13

As we have argued in our reply brief, we think the

14

perfect analogy to this situation is a building inspector who

15

is required to approve a church's building plans.

16

building inspector must evaluate the plans, sometimes must

17

counsel r.he church's architect or church's builder or carpenters

18

on the appropriateness of their plan, the placement of the

19

pews, the placement of the baptistry, the location of the altar,

20

perhaps for safety reasons, and they must ultimately approve

21

those church building plans.

22

kind of situation that is at hand today.

23

Now, that

We contend that that is the same

Both situations are hands-on in the analogy or the

24

criteria that is advanced by the state in this case.

25

have said hands-on funding of ministerial programs are
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

They

1

unconstitutional, while hands-off programs like the G.I. Bill

2

are appropriately constitutional.

3
4
5

These may provide neat labels but there is no
constitutional justification for these labels.
Our position is that all citizens and all buildings

6

must be treated equally.

7

like any other assembly building.

8

must be treated equally just like all other blind students.

9

Church buildings are treated just
Blind ministerial students

The Respondent, however, does not distance himself

10

from the central fallacy of the State Supreme Court, although

11

they try to basically repudiate that Court's decision; that

12

is they still continue to focus on just ministerial students

13

to make their analysis of the primary effect test and the

14

excessive entanglement test.

15

This Court, in the case of Mueller and Widmar, held

16

that provisions of benefits to a broad spectrum of groups is

17

an important index of secular effect and the state chooses

18

to ignore the fact that this has been the case here; that there

19

is a broad spectrum of groups of all blind students, of all

20

careers, that are entitled to participate in a program.

21

We would suggest that there is no imprimatur of

22

government approval for religious institutions in this

23

circumstance.

24

Court to be an unconstitutional — to create an unconstitutional

25

imprimatur under the terms of Widmar versus Vincent and a

number of other cases.

2

case as would be suggested by the state.

3

say the public would perceive this more as an anti-discrimination

4

kind of law rather than an endorsement of religion kind of

5

law that this Court has found to be fatally violating the

6

First Amendment.

7

There is no fatal symbolism in this
In fact, we would

In the case of McDaniel versus Paty, this Court

8

rejected an idea that is central to the state's position and

9

that is that ministers as symbols of the church somehow

10

justify disparate treatment of those ministers.

11

we are dealing here with ministerial students rather than those

12

who have accomplished their training and have reached their

13

desired career objective.

14

ment between those two statuses.

15

wants to be a minister the state feels there is some symbolic

16

violation of the First Amendment here.

faiths?
MR. FARRIS:

Yes.

The leaders of those faiths would

24

be equally entitled to participate or the leader^ of secular

25

faiths that this Court has recognized in certain of its cases.
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

We would contend that there is no excessive entanglement

2

here in the counseling program that the state has suggested

3

must take place.

4
5

The requirements are —

QUESTION:

Mr. Farris, I gather the Supreme Court

didn't reach the entanglement question.

6

MR. FARRIS:

No.

It found the entanglement analysis

7

ill-suited to this case and it found a lack of facts in the

8

record to do that.

9

State of Washington was right on those points, saying that

We think that the Supreme Court of the

10

the state did not build its record to bring an entanglement

11

argument.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

If we thought that issue was still open,

what should we do, send it back?
MR. FARRIS:

Well, it would only be open, Your Honor,

15

if the state is allowed to proceed into its new argument and

16

I think that the face of the record is pretty certain.

17

the worst case, it should be sent back rather than saying —

18

holding that the excessive entanglement doctrine has been

19

violated here.

QUESTION:

But, the state is entitled to present,

that position, I suppose.

MR. FARRIS:

They did not argue, Your Honor, at the

24

Washington Supreme Court level or at any level below that the

25

program violated the First Amendment.

It was their contention

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

always before that the First Amendment was always irrelevant.

2

So, it would seem —

QUESTION:

Well, nevertheless, the Washington Supreme

Court thought there was an entanglement issue, but it just

put it aside.

6

based on — It may be an infirm argument, but they are entitled

7

to argue it.

And, I suppose the state may argue for affirmance

8

MR. FARRIS:

9

QUESTION:

They are entitled to argue it certainly.
Is it also possible the Supreme Court

10

of the state thought there was so little to the argument that

11

it didn't deserve any comment at all?

12

MR. FARRIS:

I think that would be more in line with

13

our position, Your Honor, but, in any event, the State Supreme

14

Court said that — Rather than there was an entanglement issue,

15

they thought that the analysis was ill-suited to the case and

16

there was no record.

17

QUESTION:

It is unnecessary for us to attempt —

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

I guess they said a strained analysis of the entanglement effect,

2

but they had already decided the case.

3

MR. FARRIS:

That is correct.

They would have been

4

appropriate to — Even if they thought there was an Establishment

5

Clause — An entanglement problem, to not decided the issue,

6

but I don't read their opinion as suggesting that they really

7

thought there was one there.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

I guess Justice Utter's dissent rejected

the entanglement argument.
MR. FARRIS:

Yes.

Justice Utter made a very thorough

11

analysis and we are in strong support of his position in this

12

case and we rely on it greatly.

13

Thomas Jefferson once wrote, and this Court has quoted

14

it before, that the clergy here in this country seem to have

15

relinguished all pretentions tc privilege and to stand on the

16

footing with lawyers, physicians, etc.

17

to possess the same rights.

18

Establishment Clause argument, that ministers ought to possess

19

the same rights in the Department for the Blind as in every

20

other department that is appropriately involved with ministers

21

in the State of Washington.

22

They ought, therefore,

Tnat is the central theme of our

Under the Free Exercise portion of our argument,

23

one of the — before we get into the merits of that, we must

24

address the issue of whether this Court should decide the issue

25

now or remand it for a decision of the state constitutional

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

issue.

2

General's office, has raised the suggestion that this case

3

be remanded for a decision of the state constitutional issue

4

since it would be, in all fairness, to say that the Supreme

5

Court of Washington hinted at the result but ducked the issue.

6

Some of the amici, most particularly the Solicitor

QUESTION:

You mean remand it after this Court dis­

7

poses of the issues that the Supreme Court of Washington did

8

decide?

9

MR. FARRIS:

10

That is correct, Your Honor.

And, although the Solicitor's office does not cite

11

the case, some of the other amici cite the case of Rescue Army

12

against Municipal Court.

13

to counter this argument.

14

We rely on Widmar versus Vincent

In the Rescue Army case, there was a complex

15

statutory scheme that was not fully interpreted by the California

16

courts.

17

circumstances where state law is highly ambiguous or if a state

18

law construction is fairly possible to avoid the federal

19

constitutional issues.

20

And, this Court held that remand is appropriate under

This Court also said in the Rescue Army case that

21

discretion would be exercised depending upon the degree of

22

uncertainty about the state law issue.

23

In this case, there is no ambiguity, there is no

uncertainty in this case.

25

involved, this case is as far at the end of the uncertainty

side as can possibly be­

2

lt is our contention, as we argued in our reply brief,

3

that there is no difference between this case and Widmar as

4

far as this issue is concerned.

5

QUESTION:

So, you don't think that even if — For

6

instance, you said it would not be an establishment, that you

7

think the Washington — the State of Washington would have

8

to extend it; that it just couldn't say, well, whether this

9

is an establishment or not, we prefer not to furnish aid to

10

this kind of religious education.

11

MR. FARRIS:

That would be our position, Your Honor,

12

but that is not this case.

13

of the State of Washington chose to fund this kind of aid.

14

And, it is our position that this Court ought to permit, both

15

under the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause,

16

the enforcement of that legislative will.

17
18

QUESTION:

This case is that the legislature

I suppose the Commission thougnt that

extending the aid would violate the state Constitution.

19

MR. FARRIS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. FARRIS:

That is correct.
What are you going to do about that?
Well, it is our position that the state

22

constitutional provision as so applied is unconstitutional

23

as applied just like —

QUESTION:

So, you have to get to your free exercise

argument.
18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. FARRIS:

2

QUESTION:

3

That is correct, Your Honor.
And, you have to win on it really in the

long run to do any good.

4

MR. FARRIS:

5

QUESTION:

That is absolutely correct, Your Honor.
And, in fact, if it is correct that the

6

state Constitution prohibits this kind of state aid, then we

7

do have the case that I posed to you and Justice White posed

8

to you in the question.

9

state says you can't provide this kind of aid in a vocational

10

rehabilitation or any other kind of a program.

11

MR. FARRIS:

It would be analogous to Sherbert and

Thomas in that kind of situation, yes, Your Honor.

13
14

We would have a situation where the

QUESTION:

But, we don't have that case at the present

time, do we?

15

MR. FARRIS:

It is my position that you do not, because

16

there has been a distinction between applying a constitutional

pro.ision — I think there is a distinction between applying

18

the state constitutional provision and the policymakers of

19

the state saying we want to fund this aid.

20

QUESTION:

Now, the state —

There is no question that the State of

21

Washington legislature passed a statute which is construed

22

by the Supreme Court of Washington, said we want to fund this

aid.

24

because of the First; Amendment of the United Spates Constitution.

Now, if this Court were to hold that was wrong, then

of Washington would say, well, it violated the state Constitution,

but it hasn't said that at this stage of the litigation.

5

MR. FARRIS:

It has not directly said.

It has hinted

at it broadly.

QUESTION:

Well, is that the whole picture?

Are

there not state administrative regulations in this very program

8

that make it clear that aid will not be furnished, payments

won't be made to pay for religious study?

MR. FARRIS:

There is a policy that has been advanced

but it is not a form of a regulation.

MR. FARRIS:

That is correct, Your Honor.
Mr. Farris, may I just review one thing

with you?

on the Establishment Clause issue as a federal constitutional

matter and if we should be in doubt as to what the state might

Is it not correct that if we should agree with you

MR. FARRIS:

That is correct, Your Honor.

But, we

is that not correct?

MR. FARRIS:

MR. FARRIS:

10

That is correct.
And, they actually addressed the issue.
That is correct.

But, we think the

11

language adopted by the seven-member majority was so clear

12

as to their intent of what they would do if they had to reach

13

the issue.

14

a far stricter separation of church and state which I have

15

described in our reply brief as an anvil-like hint of what

16

they were going to do if they actually reached the state con­

There is a lot of difference between anvil­

MR. FARRIS:

I am not suggesting they did misinterpret

it, but it is a little different.

2

no uncertainty in the State Supreme Court's position on this.

3

QUESTION:

Well, there certainly is no ambiguity

4

or uncertainty about the state's policy as interpreted by the

5

state's highest court and the state's policy is not to fund

6

this kind of education.

7

MR. FARRIS:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

That is the State Supreme Court's —
So, we don't have to be concerned about

what the state Constitution says because, as a matter of state
policy as interpreted by the state court, they don't fund it.

11

MR. FARRIS:

12

QUESTION:

I think that that

—

And, you take the position that the Free

13

Exercise Clause of the federal Constitution requires them to

14

fund it against their will.

15

MR. FARRIS:

Well, I would not characterize it as

16

state policy, Your Honor.

17

by the legislature.

18

courts are there to interpret the law, not to make policy.

19

So, in my theory of the case, there is a difference between

20

policy and constitutional adjudication.

21

QUESTION:

State policy, in my view, is made

Policy is not made by the courts.

The

Well, let's explore this a little bit

22

further.

23

to get on to, but is there a state policy which says this kind

24

of education will not be funded even though the legislature

25

has said it should be unless there is some constitutional

4

of higher education that was granting aid to all private schools

5

in the State of Washington, private college students, and in

6

there there was an exclusion for those pursuing a theological

7

course of study.

In fact, we cite in our opening brief another program

8
9
10

And, it is our argument that if the state legislature
wants to exclude these kinds of people it knows how to do it
and it has done so in the past.

11

And, the argument about state policy, I think, is

12

made difficult because the state constitutional provisions

13

have been interpreted to prohibit aid of any kind to religious

14

colleges at all.

QUESTION:

What precisely is the source of this state

policy to which you referred in answering Justice O'Connor's

MR. FARRIS:

My understanding of what constitutes

state policy for constitutional purposes —

I mean in this particular case the question

21

was raised there is a state policy against it.

22

the — how does that policy manifest itself?

I think that the policy analysis ascribes

We are not talking about some administrator

who intransigently refuses to carry out the will of the legislature,

6

even though there are no constitutional impediments to him

7

doing so.

8

MR. FARRIS:

9

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
And, the only policy the Supreme Court

10

of Washington purported to be expressing was a federal constitutio ia

policy.

12
13

MR. FARRIS:

And, that is also correct, Your Honor.

We think that they were obviously in error.

14

Briefly, in the

15

Respondent, they argued that this is a case like Harris versus

McRae and this Court should not find against the legislative

As we have argued already, we are not asking this

Court to override the legislative will.

in this case have said it is okay for ministerial students

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY R. MALONE, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT.

5

6
7

Very well.

MR. MALONE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I wish to address four points.

First, I wish to

8

discuss why this particular vocational rehabilitation program

9

is not like the G.I. Bill or, and this is saying the same thing,

10

why it is not like the program involved in Mueller versus Allen

11

and I wish to discuss why this difference is critical con­

12

stitutionally.

13

Second, I wish to touch on this question that has

14

been referred to in counsel's argument as to the statutory

15

source of the federal funding and supposed deficiencies of

16

the record on this question, because that bears upon whether

17

or not I should have been making my first point at all.

18

Thirdly, I wish to examine how this question of our

19

submission differs from that of the court below and what dif­

20

ference, if any, it makes.

21

22
23

And, fourthly, I wish to step back and ask what role
does the Free Exercise Clause play in all of this?
I think by now it is apparent that it is important

24

indeed and that the Petitioner is 4-rying to use the Free Exercise

23

Clause not only to invalid the religion clauses of our state
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Constitution, but also to have the Free Exercise Clause swallow

2

up a large part, I would suggest, of the Establishment Clause

3

jurisprudence of this Court as well.

4

Before turning to our first point though, I want to take

5

up this question of state policy.

6

provisions that are relevant in this case.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MALONE:

9

10
11

We have two constitutional,

In which Constitution?
The state Constitition.

Article I,

Section 11, says no public money shall be applied to any
religious instruction.
Article IX, Section 4, says all schools maintained

12

or supported, wholly or in part by public funds, shall be ever

13

free from sectarian control.

14

In Weiss versu:; Bruno, a decision of our State

15

Supreme Court, which was referred to in the decision below

16

in this very case, the Court made it clear that it takes —

17

under those religion clauses the funding restrictions for

18

religious instruction tor church-affiliated schools are even

19

more strict than those established by this Court under the

20

Establishment Clause.

21

22

Now, that is the source of the policy that we are
talking about.

That policy —

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. MALONE:

25

It is a state constitutional policy?
The state Constitution.

Now, that policy

in the state Constitution was embodied in a written policy
26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

statement applicable to this particular program which said

2

we cannot fund ministerial students.

3

is absolutely right.

4

Constitution.

But, Justice Rehnquist

That policy is embodied right in the

5

Secondly, I would suggest that there is nothing in

6

the state statutes involving this program which are contrary

7

to that policy.

8

we used have — it was changed somewhat in 1983 — said the

9

Commission for the Blind may maintain or cause to be maintained

The state statutes or the state statute which

10

a program of services to assist visually handicapped people.

11

Under such program the Commission may provide for special educat

12

or training in professions, businesses, etc.

13

The new statute for all practical purposes is quite

14

similar in this respect, that it is discretionary.

15

read in there a legislative determination that, boy, we want

16

to fund ministerial training.

W

I do not

So, again, we have the basic policy established in

18

our Constitution which the Petitioner wishes to have invalidated

19

and we do not have a clear legislative declaration that it

20

wants to override that policy.

21

QUESTION:

General Malone, that certainly isn't the

22

position taken by the Supreme Court of Washington.

23

that you differ from the Supreme Court of Washington, but

24

certainly the easy way out for the Supreme Court of Washington

*.5

in this case would be to say, well, this statute doesn't

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

I realize

authorize what the Plaintiff wants, so we don't have to get

2

to any constitutional —
MR. MALONE:

3

I am not saying the statute doesn't

4

authorize it.

5

statute is ambiguous and the statute shows the legislature

6

did not specifically address the question, do we fund ministerial

7

training or don't we?
QUESTION:

8
9

I am saying the statute does not — that the

But, the Supreme Court of Washington

certainly took the position that ministerial training was going

10

to be funded unless there was a constitutional objection to

11

it, don't you think?
MR. MALONE:

12

Let me put it this way.

They certainly

13

took the position that it was okay for the Department of Services

14

to the Blind to put blind people through the program, including

15

the program of ministerial training unless there was a con­

16

stitutional objection to it, yes.

17

With that,

18

QUESTION:

would like to —
Mr. Malone, is it our function to try

19

to construe the state Constitution here when the Supreme Court

20

did not —

21

MR. MALONE:

No.

All I am trying — Mr. Justice

22

Burger, absolutely not.

23

source of this state policy is and how it goes right back

24

to our Constitution.

25

QUESTION:

I am trying to point out what the

And, even more importantly, I —
Well, Mr. Malone, under your version,
28

.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the applicable Washington law, would it be perfectly all right

2

to have funded Mr. Witters' education at Inland School if

3

he wanted to study history, for example?

4
5

MR. MALONE:
yes.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MALONE:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

If he wanted to study solely history,

He could do that in a religious school?
Yes.

Indeed —

And, it would be all right under the

state Constitution as well as the federal to pay the tuition.
MR. MALONE:

Not certainly the federal, probably

11

the state at least if he wants to be a historian, if he wants

12

that to be his profession.

13

I would like to discuss then why this vocational

14

rehabilitation program is simply not tike the G.I. Bill and

15

why that difference is constitutionally critical.

16

Now, what I might call the normal rule seems to

17

be that in cases such as this one must separate out the secular

18

from the sectarian and fund only the secular, not the sectarian.

19

However, there is apparently an exception, what you might

20

call the delivery system, which embodies a hands-off, passive

21

role on the part of the government, and if the program in

22

terms of beneficiaries is sufficiently broad-based, apparently

23

one does not need to make this separation.

24
25

I would suggest that is the rationale which was
applied in Mueller.

I would suggest that that is the rationale
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

which would justify the application of the G.I. Bill to

2

ministerial training.
Now, there is, of course, in this case no effort

3
4

whatsoever to make any such separation.
So, the effort must be to come within what we might

5

6

call the Mueller G.I. Bill exception.

The Solicitor General

7

and the Petitioner in his opening brief argued exactly that.

8

This program was just like the G.I. Bill and the Mueller

9

rationale applied.
Now, we say that it is not like the G.I. Bill.

10
11

The Mueller rationale does not apply.

12

terms of the G.I. Bill itself.

13

Let me illustrate in

Under the G.I. Bill the government really just cares

14

that the veteran is in an accredited school and that is it.

15

The specific school that he goes to, as long as it is accredited -

16

and by the way, the federal government doesn't even do the

17

accreditation.

18

government.

What courses he takes are of no concern to the

19

government.

Whether the student has made any sort of career

20

source is of no concern to the government.

21

Sanskrit and spend the rest of his time wandering around in

22

Indian, say, and that is of no concern to the government at

23

all.

24
25

The specific school is of no concern to the

But, let's change things.

He could take

Let's suppose that the

government amended the G.I. Bill and said you have to make
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

a career choice now and we have to approve that career choice.
In light of that career choice, we also have to

3

approve the school and the courses you want to select to make

4

sure that it all fits.

5

Now, let's set aside for the moment the question

6

of how the government goes about making those decisions, what

7

criteria to use to approve or not approve those choices. The

8

mere fact of need for approval, it seems to me, changes the

9

delivery system, if you will, and takes the program out of

10

the Mueller rationale, the Mueller G. I. Bill exception, and

11

back into the normal rule of leading, of having to bring about

12

that submission.

13

And, I suggest that the vocational rehabilitation

14

program we have here is exactly like that new G.I. Bill and,

15

therefore, it cannot fall within the Mueller rationale, the

16

Mueller exception, and the normal rule that you have to make

'7

the separation.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Malone, are you asking that we focus

19

on the fact that in order to get the aid Mr. Witters must

20

subject himself to state regulation, is that your concern,

21

or is it that it advances religion in your view because Mr.

22

Witters wants to become a minister?

23
24

o

MR. MALONE:

Both.

Which is it?

I focus on both, so to speak,

what is delivered, what the stare ic buying, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

Do you think the Court normally looks

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

at the program as a whole rather than focusing on the individual

2

receiving the aid in these cases?

3
4
5

MR. MALONE:

It is precisely — Yes.

It is precisely

there that we part company somewhat with the court below.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think this Court generally

6

has given a broader focus to the inquiry rather than just

7

looking to the individual?

8

has a welfare program and hands out welfare money to someone

9

who tells you I am going to give part of this money to the

10

11
12
13

church on Sunday.

For example, suppose the state

Is that okay?

MR. MALONE:

Absolutely — Of course, yes.

Absolutely

no problem there.
But, what is the difference from that situation

14

and the situation here’

15

suggest, this:

16

him ministerial training.

17

the Free Exercise Clause, and, indeed, our State Supreme Court

18

would say that fact in and of itself is fatal.

19

The situation you have here is, I

Mr. Wirters wants to the state to buy for
Now, that is not a good start under

We suggest, though it is not a good start, it is

20

not the end of the inquiry, precisely, Justice O'Connor, because

21

of the point you just raised.

22

what is provided, what is delivered, you have to look at the

23

nature of the delivery system, at the breadth of the types

24

of beneficiaries, the overall scope of the program, and also

25

in looking at the overall program you also have to look at

You have to look not only at

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the role of the state in that program in order to see whether

2

or not it embodies a hands-off policy, such as I suggest you

3

had in Mueller, or whether it — And, such as I suggest you

4

also have in the G.I. Bill.

5

Our basic submission is that if you do not have

6

that hands-off policy, then you are back under the normal

7

rule.

You have to separate out the religious and the secular.

8
9

QUESTION:

General Malone, was this Inland Empire

Bible School, was that an undergraduate institution?

10

MR. MALONE:

11

QUESTION:

I believe that it was.
And, if Mr. Witters had qualified under

12

the G.I. Bill, could he have done — taken just the courses

13

and enrolled for just what he proposed to enroll under the

14

G.I. Bill.

15
16
17

MR. MALONE:

I believe he could have as I understand

the G.I. Bill.
And, again, the reason we say he can't use our money

18

for that or he can't use this program for that is because

19

of the difference in the delivery system between the G.I.

20

Bill and this program.

21

Now, the Petitioner says that this question of state

22

involvement under this program is being exaggerated and that

23

we can make approval decisions on the basis of objective

24

criterion and that somehow this solves the problem.

25

I suggest that it does not solve the problem at all.
33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

Well,

1

The state has to approve, first of all, the career

2

choice.

3

objective criteria might work in that respect.

I think we are all agreed on that.

Let's see how

4

Suppose again, on the basis of objective criteria,

5

say Department of Labor data, the Episcopal Church, we find,

6

has a surplus of priests and the Catholic Church has a shortage

7

or there is a great need for Lutheran ministers but there

8

doesn't seem to be much need at all for denominational ministers.

9

Now, the vocational educational counselor then,

10

right at the start, is going to have to say, I am sorry, I

11

can't help you if you want to be Episcopalian, if you want

12

to be an Episcopal priest, or a non-denomination minister,

13

but if you want to be a Lutheran minister or a Catholic priest,

14

yes.

15

you.

On the basis

>f these objective criteria, I can help

16

Suppose one particular seminary or bible college

17

has a great success- rate in its placement of its graduates

18

and suppose another one has a low success rate.

19

counselor has to say to the student, though you really want

20

to go to Seminary X.

21

or priest, you have to go to Seminary Y.

22

So, the voc/rehak

I am sorry, if you want to be a minister

Suppose we had something like an objective test,

23

say, put out by Educational Testing Service up in Princeton,

24

similar to the LSAT for ministerial students.

25

at least some state official is going to have to decide on

Counselor or

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

a cut-off point as to who, you know, passes and who flunks.

2

And, he is going to have to say to one student, okay, we will

3

pay for your ministerial training and he is going to have

4

to say to another, we won't pay for yours.

5

to us you are too low, you are not going to be a success,

6

either in school or you are not going to be a success in the

7

ministry.

8
9

The test indicates

Now, I think that — I dare say that the likelihood
of these things happening even under the so-called objective

10

criteria which the Petitioner would have you rely on, it seems

11

to me the likelihood of these things happening should be very

12

disturbing, whether we focus on either the second or the third

13

prong of the Lemon test.

14

QUESTION:

General Malone, what is there in the

15

record to tell us anything about the likelihood that any of

16

these things might happen?

17

MR. MALONE:

In terms of the actual operation —

18

Well, let me put it another way.

19

80 percent federally funded. The record does not say where

20

that federal funding comes from.

21

We do know that this is

of problem that might develop in this case?

MR. MALONE:

Yes and no and let me explain that

answer.

the argument before the State Supreme Court the only thing

5

we were talking about were the state constitutional provisions

that I mentioned at the beginning of my argument.

was no need to focus at all upon the Establishment Clause

problem at all or the entanglement problem in particular.

Through the trial court level and, indeed, through

So, there

Whether you elected to rely on the federal

Constitution in defending your oponent's claim was certainly

11

within your control, not within your adversary's.

QUESTION:

Certainly.

Were this issue, Justice —

Let me ask one other question.

Supposing,

14

as has been suggested, that we thought there was no merit

to the primary effects defense, but maybe there is problem

16

with the entanglement as you argue today.

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
And, they haven't decided it and say

19

we send it back and decide the entanglement issue.

20

you then develop the record that would support this argument?

21

MR. MALONE:

Couldn't

Certainly, certainly, Mr. Justice Stevens.

22

On the one hand, I realize the difficulties which come from

23

just relying upon the federal regulations, the federal statutes,

24

the federal regulations.

25

QUESTION:

I understand those difficulties.

Your hypotheticals have triggered a question

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

in my mind I would like to put to you if I may.

2

about employment opportunities in different denominations.

3

Supposing you had an unemployed assistant pastor of the Lutheran

4

Church or something and he went in for unemployment compensation.

5

Would he be denied unemployment compensation?

MR. MALONE:

10

QUESTION:

of stuff?
MR. MALONE:

One, would he have to be denied unemploy­

ment compensation under the Establishment Clause?

13

No.

Would he be under the religion provisions of our

14

state Constitution?

15

question.

16

Would he have to prove that he had really

been a minister and that he was eligible and all that sort

11

12

And, let me put to you another

case.

No, no.

You talked

I would suggest no, which raises another

Department of Services for the Blind and says I am not going

21

to be able to perform my functions as a minister unless I

22

get this training in Braille, will you give it to me?

23

my answer would be the Free Exercise Clause would require

24

that we give it to him.

25

prohibit it, nor would the religion clauses of our State

2

That is to say is something which somebody could well want

3

for purposes having nothing to do with religion.

4

Why?

Because Braille is not religion-specific.

Now, what I am suggesting, and this gets back to

5

Justice O'Connor's question as to the scope of the Free Exercise

6

Clause here, it seems to me that under such cases as McDaniel

7

v. Paty and Sherbert versus Verner, what was involved there

8

were benefits or rights or whatever that were not religion-

9

specific .

10

What Mr. Witters wants here is to use the Free Exercise

11

Clause to require the state to give him something that is

12

religion-specific.

13

McDaniel v. Paty does not require that.

QUESTION:

It all depends on the lens with which

14

you view it.

15

we have here is educational funding for vocational rehabili­

16

tation, then it isn't religious-specific.

17

on Mr. Witters, it is.

Thomas.

If you focus just

The same ^n Sherbert, the same in

It depends on how you look at it.
MR. MALONE:

I am using the religion-specific/not

20

religion-specific distinction, Justice O'Connor, as a

21

distinction which should be embodied in applying the Free

22

Exercise Clause.

23

When you get to the Establishment Clause question,

24

I suggest that, indeed, the question is how do you look to

25

it and I suggest that the critical question is under what
38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

circumstances do you have to make this separation which clearly

2

is not being made here.

3

I am suggesting that this case does not present

4

the circumstances under which you have the G.I. Bill or the

5

Mueller type exception.

6

I would suggest then that these objective criteria

7

are going to produce very strange results which I should

8

suggest this Court should find very disturbing under the Establish

9

ment Clause.

10

Now, this counselor that I was talking about quite

11

possibly might find some way out of this, might say, well,

12

I am getting over my head.

13

QUESTION:

General Malone, I notice there were hearings

14

first Before an initial hearing officer and then a review

15

within the administrative agency.

16

how the program works or whether there would be counselors

17

involved brought out there?

18

MR. MALONE:

Was any evidence as to

None of what I am discussing

19

now was brought out at those administrative proceedings,

20

because again, Justice Rehnquist, what we were focusing on

21

was at that stage all the way up until the Supreme Court of

22

the State of Washington issued its opinion, all we were focusing

23

on were the state religion clauses.

24
25

For my discursfon here as to entanglement, I am
relying upon the federal regulations and the state regulations

which pretty much track this.

QUESTION:

Mr. Malone, what would you say about

3

a foundation that was created to grant scholarships, only

4

one purpose to grant scholarships to students studying for

5

the priesthood of the Roman Catholic Church.

11

MR. MALONE:

Would it be

Yes, and I believe that it would, and

I believe that it would under the reasoning of this Court
in Walz.

The answer would be yes.
QUESTION:

It wouldn't make any difference.

It

12

would be obvious then that if it were for all religions it

13

would be equally good.

14

MR. MALONE:

Yes.

I see no problem with “SUTtcTtlSiT-

15

but again, 501(c)(3) involves a hands-off delivery system

16

as did the tax deduction -- I am sorry.

17
18

QUESTION:

Do you think that is like the tax case

in the New York situation?

19

MR. MALONE:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. MALONE:

No, the tax case in Mueller.
I beg your pardon?
I am referring to Mueller when I say

22

the 501(c)(3) is like the —

23

QUESTION:

Well, is it not also comparable to the

24

general rule which has been laid down that churches are not

25

to be taxed?
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. MALONE:

2

QUESTION:

3

Oh, Walz as well, yes.
In other words, 501(c)(3) merely implements

that —

4

MR. MALONE:

Yes.

I could justify 501(c)(3), Mr.

5

Chief Justice, both under the type of Mueller rationale and

6

under the Walz rationale, which I think are quite similar.

7

To get back to my counselor who is worried about

8

the types of results that would come out under these co-called

9

objective criteria, that counselor might well say, well, I

10

am over my head, I don't know anything about this, and I am

11

in an area that is religiously sensitive, I am going to get

12

out of it, I am going to rely on the experts.

13

them tell me whether or not this person has the aptitudes

14

for the ministry, whether this school is the best school fcr

15

this type of ministry, so on and so forth.

16

I will let

But, I would suggest who are those experts?

Those

17

experts have to be church and seminary or bibl'e school officials

18

themselves.

19

So, once our counselor decides to do that, then

20

it seems to me you walk right into a Grendel's den type of

21

problem.

You have a type of delegation.

22

So, it seems to me that however much you try, given

23

the federal regulations and the state regulations that govern

24

this program, there is no way to get out of this swamp.

25

is no way to get out of this entanglement.
41

With respect to the Free Exercise Clause issue,

again, I would just emphasize that a state should have the

option under this Court's jurisprudence to say we do not want

to fund ministerial students.

the religion clauses of our state Constitution.

that there is nothing in the Free Exercise Clause decisions of

MR. FARRIS:

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. FARRIS, ESQ.

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

15

MR. FARRIS:

Yes.

In response to the arguments raised

16

by the Respondent in this case, I would point out, first of

17

all, that ;he G.I. Bill, unlixe the contentions of the

18

Respondent, is concerned with the career choice selected by

19

the recipients of that Bill.

20

As we pointed out in Footnote 20 of our opening

21

brief, 38 U.S.C., Section 1673, lists a number of courses

22

of study in career objectives which are excluded from the

23

Bill's coverage, including any course in bartending, personality

24

development, sales courses, etc., are types of courses that

25

the G.I. Bill excludes.

So, there is concern there by the
42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Congress, just as there is concern by the state legislature,

2

that people will pursue career choices that will lead to

3

legitimate kinds of employment.

4

Also to answer the Chief Justice's inquiry, the

5

Solicitor's brief points out in Footnote 3 that Inland Empire

6

School of the Bible is an eligible institution for people

7

to enroll in the G.I. Bill.

8
9

Turning to the meat of the Respondent's argument,
they have argued based on speculation, as we suggested in

10

our opening argument, about various kinds of things that might

11

happen, could have happened, might happen under the career

12

counseling that takes place, but they did not put any kind

13

of this evidence in the record below.

14

If they thought the federal Constitution or the

15

federal statutes or the federal regulations came them a source

16

of defense of this claim, they could have and should have,

17

we would submit, put the evidence in the record below and

18

their failure to put that evidence in should not be charged

19

to our account at this point.

20

We think this case should be decided on the record

21

and it should not be sent back for development of more facts,

22

and, moreover, it should not be decided at all on speculation

23

as engaged in by Respondent.

24

QUESTION-

But, if we just reverse — Our usual

mandate says reversed and the case is remanded for further

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

would just be up to the Washington Supreme Court.

3

the case was over, the case was over, but if it wanted to

decide the entanglement question, I don't suppose we could

5

say that it was forbidden to do so.

MR. FARRIS:

QUESTION:

I know what you desire.

But, you don't really think we have to,

16

that it really is an issue that is required to be decided

17

to reverse the Washington Supreme Court.

18

MR. FARRIS:

It is not required absolutely, but

19

if there is no prudential consideration of the Rescue Army

20

type of criteria for failing to do so, we would urge this

21

Court to decide the Free Exercise Clause issue.

22

QUESTION:

Of course, if it went back to the State

23

Supreme Court and the State Supreme Court went against you,

24

conceivably you might be up on a Free Exercise claim or you

25

might try to get up on a Free Exercise claim here.
