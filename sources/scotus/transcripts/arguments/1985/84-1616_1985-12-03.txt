The case arises out of these circumstances.

2

In February of 1979, a Montgomery steel company.

3

Steel Industries, its parent corporation, and the

4

stockholders of that corporation filed a lawsuit against

5

the bank, a loan officer, and a number of other

6

individuals in Montgomery County State Court.

This is

13

several of its creditors, an involuntary bankrupt.

Approximately six weeks later, that steel

At that time its parent corporation and the

14

shareholders of that corporation lost all authority to

shareholders filed a second action in Federal District

Court.

That was hotly disputed, as you might imagine,

QUESTION*

Mr. Wilson, would you be good

7

enough to tell us if the record reflects when the state

court decided the respondent's post-trial motions, and

9

when the appeal was filed?

10

MR. WILSON*

At the time the respondent sought

11

the injunction in federal court, its posttrial motions

12

were pending in state court.

13

because once the injunction issued, no further

14

proceedings took place in state court.

1

people, your opponents had appealed the judgment to the

2

Supreme Court of Alabama, and while the appeal was

3

pending it would still be a nonfinal judgment?

4

HR, WILSQNi

Justice Rehnquist, I would

5

confess that I have difficulty with that issue.

It

6

appears to me that it is a final judgment when they

7

determine it on the merits, but technically, for

8

purposes of an appeal in the Alabama court system, it is

9

not final because they have filed their pcstjudgment

10

motions, but I don't think that that should — I don't

11

see that as a basis for this Court allowing an

12

injunction after such substantial resources have been

13

expended.

14

QUESTION;

Hell, so when you are talking about

15

a final judgment, you are talking about hew the Alabama

16

court system

17

judgment had gone exactly as far as the one in which

18

your client participated in

19

Would the Alabama courts have treated it as a binding

20

judgment for res judicata purposes under state law?

would view that particular — what if a

the Alabama court system?

21

MR. WILSON;

Certainly.

Certainly they would

22

have under state law,

23

course if you are ultimately successful in having that

24

judgment reversed on appeal, then its res judicata

25

effect is eliminated, but for res judicata purposes

and subject to its appeal, and of

MR. WILSON*

On the state law issues?
And on the federal law

You would be arguing the same thing

15

even if the affirmative defense had never been presented

MR. WILSON:

QUESTION:

5

— in a way that the federal court

Credit Act.
N

6

HR. WILSON:

Absolutely, and that is the

7

nature of the independent -- the independent nature of

8

the two court systems.

9

that issue.

This Court ultimately can decide

It is a federal issue presented in the

10

state court and which formed the basis for a petition

11

for certiorari later.

12

QUESTION:

I suppose you would say then that

13

the federal court could have enjoined the state action

14

before judgment.

15
16

HR. WILSON:

As far as the bar of the Full

Faith and Credit Act, yes, they could have.

17

QUESTION:

18

HR. WILSON:

19

QUESTION:

20

on the res judicata question.

21

MR. WILSON:

Yes.
I would still —
It is only when they rule finally

On the merits, and that is the

22

point that is made by Judge Hill in his dissent in the

23

Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, and I think

24

it is a good cne, that you can resolve the two acts.

25

What this Court has taught, when you look for an implied
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

repeal or an exception to the Full Faith and Credit Act#

2

you look for some clear intention, some idea that the

3

statutes cannot operate togetaer without some deadlock,

4

some direct conflict,

5

conflict is eliminated if you construe the statutes

6

together as Judge Hill did, that is, until that state

7

court rules on the merits, you can have an injunction,

8

assuming you have the other requirement for an

9

injunction.

10

QUESTIONS

and I would suggest that that

Sc you say that a federal court

11

might have concluded before judgment in the state court

12

that as a federal matter, that state court judgment

13

should not — that state court suit should not proceed

14

to judgment, and it would have been, as far as the Full

15

Faith and Credit Act was concerned, that was a

16

permissible ruling, and it involves a ruling on a

17

federal issue.

18
19

20

HF• WILSDNs

Correct, as far as the Full Faith

and Credit Act.
QUESTION;

But the next day, in a similar

21

action, if the federal court waits until after judgment

22

and the state court rules guite contrary to the federal

23

court’s view yesterday, the federal court must still

24

observe it.

25

MR. WILSON*

I do , and I think that the reason
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.^. ^0001

(202) 628-9300

1

is that the independent nature of the court systems are

2

destroyed if you allow the Federal District Court to sit

3

in effect in appellate review of that issue when it has

4

been determined on the merits by the state court.

5

to that time

6

you have an injunction of a state court proceeding, and

7

the policies, of course, as this Court has enunciated,

8

weigh against it under any set of circumstances.

9

Prior

— there are going to be problems any time

QUESTION*

What if in my first example where

10

the federal court issued the injunction before the

11

judgment in

13

in these circumstances, in these circumstances, on the

14

federal issue, any further litigation is precluded

15

because the state cause of action should have been

16

presented in the federal case?

3

here is just to rule on the Full Faith and Credit Act,

and not on the merits of the federal Issue.

MR. WILSON:

11

I certainly do

say that.

9
10

I dp say that.

QUESTION:

You think we should not ever reach

that.
MR. WILSON:

I say you should not reach that

12

in this case, because that issue, you should allow the

13

state courts the opportunity to resolve all issues

14

before them before a federal court intervenes to correct

15

any wrongdoing this Court might ultimately find.

16

QUESTION:

I see, so if the state court made a

17

mistake, it should come up through the state system and

18

then come here?

19

MR. WILSON*

Yes,

sir, that is exactly my

20

position, and there is a reason.

21

the federal system requires that, although admittedly it

22

creates problems any time you have a federal and a state

23

court with similar issues before them at the same time.

25

QUESTION*

The basic nature of

May I ask one other question about

would be permissible.

I

If it were permissible, and if it

QUESTION*

Under the Full

And your point is that it was after

8

the judgment but before the posttrial motions were ruled

9

on, and it was too late.

Shat if the federal injunction

10

had issued after the summary judgment motion had been

11

denied but before the jury came in with a verdict?

12

is when the trial court actually made its legal analysis

13

for the first time, I guess.

14

MR. WILSON*

That

That's correct, but that raises

15

the same question as raised by Justice Rehnquist's

16

earlier question.

17

final judgment for state law res judicata purposes.

18

denial of a motion for summary judgment is not a final

19

judgment for purposes of application, and you could

20

comply with the Full Faith and Credit Act because the

21

Full Faith and Credit Act requires that the Federal

22

District Court give the same preclusive effect to the

23

state court adjudication as would be given in that

24

state.

There has been — the suggestion in the Court

10

everyone concerned as restoring the law as understood

prior to this Court's decision in Toucey.

12

That issue had never been presented in any

13

case prior# was not presented there, and certainly the

14

overruling of Toucey does net require that an additional

power be given to the stats court# that is, to

opportunity to litigate his issues.

With all respect. Your Honor,
There were two cases that were

Iowa-Wisconsin Bridge case.

12

In the Iowa-Wisconsin Bridge case, which was

13

part of Toucey, there nad been an attempt tc foreclose a

14

mortgage in the federal court, and the federal court had

15

declined to foreclose the mortgage on the basis that

16

there was invalidity and lack of consideration.

Company, brought five suits on the underlying notes in

federalism and comity and those principles,

underlying policies were indeed addressed by Congress

18

when it enacced the relitigation exception in 1948.

21

have placed on 2283 since 1948, where they indicate in

22

essence that the fact that Congress has accorded this

23

authority and this jurisdiction on the federal court

24

doesn't mean that it comes into play automatically.

25

And for that reason as well, it was felt that
39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it was necessary to give the state courts an opportunity

2

to decile this question, and indeed, as I have mentioned

3

a few moments ago, matters of practicality and prudence

4

also dictated that, because if we did not present the

5

res judicata and collateral estoppel defense to the

6

state court, but simply sought an injunction in the

7

federal court, and if we got it in the federal court and

8

it was reversed on appeal, or if we didn't get it in the

9

federal court, in the federal district court, then we

10

really would have waived the opportunity to assert that

11

defense in the state court.

12

So, there are all kinds of reasons why it has

13

to be, the defense has to be asserted in the state

proceeding, but none of this undermines or can undermine

15

the authority that Congress conferred on federal

Rehnquist, these were the underlying facts that

13

confronted this Court when it decided Toucey, namely, a

14

decision by the Delaware courts that despite the refusal

15

of the federal district court to foreclose the mortgage,

2

federal court, and enjoin the enforcement of judgment

3

nc* that it is really final.

4

KR. NACHBANi

Yes, sir, because even if a

5

state trial court gives appropriate preclusive effect to

6

a prior federal judgment, that is always subject to

7

reversal by the state appellate court, so in order to

8

give the scope to 2283 that Congress intended per force

9

it must apply to a decision

of the state appellate court

10

and permit an injunction of the state appellate

11

proceedings as well as state trial proceedings.

12

Indeed, two of the cases we cite in our brief,

13

the Silcox case and the Brown against McCormick cases,

14

in both of those cases, the matters had gotten to the

15

appellate courts before the federal injunticn issued,

16

and in one of the cases the federal appellate court

17

commended the parties for going that far in seeking to

18

get the state to give the proper preclusive effect to

19

the earlier federal judgment before seeking relief in

20

the federal courts.

21

In answer to Justice White’s question about

22

the ACL case, that case as we understand it, and we have

23

discussed it at some length in our brief, as we

24

understand it, went on the point that because of the

25

Norris-LaGuardia Act, the federal district court had not
45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

decided earlier the question of whether there could be a

2

federal injunction against — a state injunction against

3

— excuse me, a federal injunction against picketing,

4

and that simply there was a withholding of jurisdiction

5

according to the majority analysis. Your Honor, and I

6

believe Justice Brennan dissented, feeling that there

7

had been a broader issue than just the withdrawal of

8

jurisdiction under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

9

But the point of the decision was that the

10

federal district court had not decided the matter that

11

was later decided by the state court which issued the

12

injunction, and therefore the relitigation exception did

13

not cor*e into play.

2

that was Mr.

4

then that therefore the matter of whether or not to

issue an injunction had never been litigated because the

6

7

injunction since it had been withdrawn, the jurisdiction

8

had been withdrawn by the Norris-LaGuardia Act.
