CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

3

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN J. CRIBARI, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CRIBARI:

5

6

Mr. Cribari?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

7

The issue in this case is whether an unloaded

8

handgun is a dangerous weapon in violation of Section (d)

9

of the Bank Robberty Statute 18 U.S.C. 2113.

10

There are two points that I would like to make.

11

First of all, that an unloaded handgun on the facts of

12

this case is not and should not be a dangerous weapon.

13

Secondly, that even if an unloaded handgun can

14

be a dangerous weapon, it ought not to be determined to

15

be a dangerous weapon by a decision of the Court of Appeals,

16

but rather should remain a factual question for the fact­

17

finder .

18
19

The facts in this case are extremely, concisely
stated and are in pages eight to ten of the Joint Appendix.

20

The short of the matter is that Mr. McLaughlin

21

and a co-defendant entered a bank and while the co­

22

defendant

23

McLaughlin remained in the lobby area of the bank, pointed

24

a handgun generally at the people in the bank and told

25

them not to move.

emptied several teller stations of funds, Mr.

QUESTION:

1

2
3

What do you suppose they thought about

that gun?
MR. CRIBARI:

Sir, I think they thought that

4

that gun was probably loaded and I think there is no

5

argument to be made that they were not in some degree

6

frightened and there is no argument to be made that they

7

had the duty to examine that gun.

8

9

The question is how will we determine for 2113(d)
purposes that the gun was dangerous.

Certainly if the

10

gun was loaded the gun could inflict a harm that it

11

threatens to inflict and under the courts that have applied

12

an objective test that has been the test.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Would a club, a metal club be a

dangerous weapon in such an incident?
MR. CRIBARI:

Justice Marshall, I think that

16

a club could be a dangerous weapon in such an instance.

17

If the person remains in the lobby area of a bank —

MR. CRIBARI:

I think that almost anything —

Well, could a gun be a club?
Well, certainly —

Could a gun be a club?
Yes, certainly a gun could be a

club and probably a metal club at that.
QUESTION:

Well, it is dangerous then, isn't

2

it?
MR. CRIBARI:

Well, I think it is only dangerous,

3

and this is certainly the analysis used by some of the

4

courts, it is only dangerous if there is a threat to use

5

it as a club.

6

a gun and the gun does not work as a gun, the gun is not

7

dangerous as a gun.

If the only threat is to use the gun as

8

Now, the courts that have adopted — like the

9

Fourth Circuit — a presumption that any weapon, loaded

10

or unloaded, used during a bank robberty is, as a matter

11

of law, a dangerous weapon.

12

I have certainly reasoned that the fear of the

13

victims, the potential for using the gun as a club, or

14

the potential for third-party response, for example, by

15

police forces, makes the situation dangerous, but should

16

we reason from the situation back to the gun?

17

then even non-guns would be dangerous weapons.

18

If we do,

The person who goes into the bank,puts his hand

19

in his pocket and claims that he has a gun could create

20

the same amount of danger as the person who actually

21

displays a gun.

22

By the reasoning of those courts, a dangerous

23

weapon has been used even though in one instance no weapon

24

at all has been used.

25

After this Court's decision in —

QUESTION:

1

Well, I think there you can say there

2

is, in fact, no weapon or device, so that isn't covered,

3

but certainly the legislative history of this particular

4

language would indicate that the sponsor of it thought

5

it would include fake guns, for example, does it not?
MR. CRIBARI:

6

Justice O'Connor, I think in one

7

reading it does and I think in another reading, which is

8

my reading, of course, that it does not.
Certainly the sponsor envisioned fake guns or

9
10

what were referred to as Indiana six shooters or bottles

11

of water claimed to be nitroglycerin, certainly they were

12

included somewhere.

13

included?

14

The question is where were they

One of the congressmen, I think the bill's sponsor,

15

says, in response to questions about the fake weapon, that

16

he does not object to the word "device" being added, but

17

also thinks these might be covered under Section 2 of the

18

statute which at the time was bank robbery by trick or

19

fraud.

20

Also at the end of the legislative history which

21

is extremely meager, the statement — the suggestion that

22

instrumentalities which could cause fear was rejected as

23

an amendment to the Act.

24
25

So, on one hand, I think, yes, the subject of
fear of the victim was sought to be protected by the Act.
6

(202) 628-9300

1

But, on the other hand, the question is how.

I think the

2

Act can be read consistently with those courts who have

3

applied an objective standard to amount to the following:

4

If a weapon is used and that weapon is dangerous in itself

5

or can carry out the harm that it threatens you have a

6

dangerous weapon.

7

robbery by trick, you might have assault on the teller,

8

but you may not have a dangerous weapon.

If it can't, then you might have bank

The statute doesn't punish bank robbery with

9
10

a weapon, it doesn't punish bank robbery with an apparently

11

dangerous weapon, it doesn't punish bank robbery because

12

a dangerous situation is created.

13

during which an assault is committed using the dangerous

14

weapon.

It punishes bank robbery

15

If we reason from the assault —

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Cribari, it punishes bank robbery

17

with a dangerous weapon or device if the device or weapon

18

is used in an assault on a person or puts in jeopardy the

19

life of any person, doesn't it?

20

MR. CRIBARI:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

So, it really doesn't punish bank

22

robbery with a dangerous weapon.

23

MR. CRIBARI:

24
25

It punishes an assault or placing

in jeopardy during a bank robbery.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CRIBARI:

2

In Mr. McLaughlin's case, only the assaultive

10

Yes, sir.

clause of 2113(d) is operable.
QUESTION:

No one claims he put anyone's* life

in jeopardy with the starter pistol or whatever it was.
MR. CRIBARI:

It was an unloaded handgun and

the claim was not made that he put someone's life in jeopardy.
QUESTION:

You don't deny that he technically

assaulted someone, do you?
MR. CRIBARI:

No, he plead guilty to the assault.

11

He plead guilty to the (a) and (b) sections of that statute

12

which prohibit the bank robbery assault and the bank larceny

13

and we had a bench trial on the (d) section on the issue

14

of, number one, the unloaded handgun and, number two, the

15

Fourth Circuit's decision which makes it presumptive guilt

16

if you have any weapon.

17

When this Court decided Simpson in 1978, this

18

Court applied the phrase "dangerous weapon" to both clauses,

19

the assaultive clause and the putting-in-jeopardy clause.

20

Much of the case law developed prior to that

21

time and much of the case law reasons that an assault under

22

(a) that one could reasonably determine to be an aggrevated

23

assault, if there was a weapon used amounted to a violation

24

of (d), but it is unclear whether those courts read the

25

dangerous weapon phrase as modifying the assault.
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

After Simpson, when the courts had to read that,

2

I think what has happened is, so as to not to lose the

3

aggrevated assault punishment, all of that case law was

4

simply applied to the dangerous weapon in the following

5

two ways:

6

Number one, if there is enough evidence for the

7

jury to conclude the weapon was loaded it is a dangerous

8

weapon.

We don't contest that.

9

Number two, the creation of presumptive — the

10

creation of presumptions of dangerousness by the circuit

11

court, the Fourth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, possibly

12

the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits, have rules that state

13

a weapon, loaded or unloaded, used during a bank robbery

14

is a dangerous weapon.

15

There is no argument.

The effect of that is read in the indictment

16

of this case which is on page five of the Joint Appendix

17

where Mr. McLaughlin is not charged with using a dangerous

18

weapon, he is charged with brandishing that weapon, with

19

pointing a firearm at the tellers in the bank.

20

If the jury or a factfinder concludes a weapon

21

was used, and Mr. McLaughlin admitted one was, he is,

22

therefore, guilt of using a dangerous weapon without more.

23

I do not think that that is correct.

24

is a violation of Winship which was decided 16 years ago

25

today.

I do think that that

QUESTION:

1

2

Would your position be the same if

he had the gun loaded but with blanks?
MR. CRIBARI:

3

No, sir, my position — Yes, sir,

4

my position would be the same.

5

between a gun that was loaded with blanks or a gun that

6

was unloaded or a starter pistol or a gun that was not

7

loaded but there was ammunition in the person's pocket.

8

If the gun cannot function as the weapon that threatens,

9

it ought not to be a dangerous weapon.

10

I would see no difference

If Mr. McLaughlin had approached one of the people

11

in the bank and had struck them with the weapon or if he

12

had approached someone and grabbed someone and held the

13

weapon in a threatening manner to threaten bludgeoning,

14

then it becomes dangerous as a bludgeoning, but that is

15

not here.

16

QUESTION:

May I interrupt?

Supposing on the

17

facts we have got here but we have a trial, they couldn't

18

prove there were bullets in the gun.

19

and the man threw bullets out the window of his car, but

20

you couldn't prove whether they were in the gun or not

21

at the time of the transaction, who would have the burden

22

under your view of the law?

23

of proving that they were in the gun?

24
25

MR. CRIBARI:

Say they had a chase

Who would have the burden

Well, I am not sure that the —

I think the burden is on the government to prove a dangerous

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

2

weapon.
QUESTION:

So, if the government cannot, in fact,

3

prove by some evidence, by reasonable doubt, that the bullets

4

were in the gun at the time of the bank robbery, the defendant

5

would always win on that.

6

MR. CRIBARI:

I don't think that is correct.

7

I think if the government puts forth enough proof for a

8

jury to conclude that the gun must have been loaded, that

9

is sufficient.

10

For example, in this case, if there had been

11

no evidence other than Mr. McLaughlin pointing the handgun —

12

The cases, I think, establish that a factfinder, judge or jury

13

could conclude that gun was loaded and dangerous since

14

there is no evidence to the contrary.

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

QUESTION:

On the other hand, is there any evidence

to show that they knew that the gun was unloaded?
MR. CRIBARI:

In this case there is.

The govern­

ment conceded that —
QUESTION:

No, I am talking about the people

in the bank.
MR. CRIBARI:

No, sir, there is no evidence to

22

show that the people knew the gun was unloaded and there

23

is no attempt to diminish the fear of the people and there

24

is no attempt'to say that people ought to know the gun

25

was unloaded.

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

1

If they got fear — Can you get fear

2

without fear of a deadly weapon?

3

MR. CRIBARI:

Sir, I think there is as much fear

4

in the case of an unloaded handgun as there is in a loaded

5

one.
QUESTION:

6
7

Well, that is what a deadly weapon

is.

8

MR. CRIBARI:

9

QUESTION:

10

That is why a weapon is deadly because

it can harm.

11
12

MR. CRIBARI:

I agree, sir, that the weapon is

deadly because it can harm.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CRIBARI:

15

I don't —

What size gun was it?
I don't know.

All we have in the

record is that it was a dark handgun.

16

The weapon is dangerous because it can harm,

17

but, if, in fact, it cannot harm in the manner in which

18

it is used —

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. CRIBARI:

21

Supposing he had bullets in his pocket?
Then the weapon didn't work as

a gun.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. CRIBARI:

What if he has the safety device on?
Well, Justice O'Connor, I think

24

at some point we have to draw a line.

25

was the fact that the gun was loaded.

The line I drew

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

Now, if a factfinder could conclude that the

2

safety device was not — even though it was on — the gun

3

being otherwise operable and loaded, the factfinder could

4

conclude that that didn't matter.

5

thing and so easily changed that it did not effectively

6

negate the harm the gun threatened.

7

convict someone of using that weapon.

8

to be taken from the factfinder as a matter of law.

9

QUESTION:

That is such a small

Then, fine, you can
But, it ought not

Well, can't you push a bullet into

10

a six shooter chamber as easily as you can take off the

11

safety device?

12

MR. CRIBARI:

Well, I don't know.

I don't know

13

if you can because it certainly has to be opened, it has

14

to be taken out and put in.

15

is a workable standard simply to say that if the bullets

16

are within a foot of the gun maybe it is dangerous, maybe

17

it isn't, if they are far away maybe it is less dangerous.

18

And, I don't think that it

I think we look at the gun and then we look at

19

the way it is used and if it is used in such a way that

20

it can readily inflict the harm it threatens, then it is

21

used as a dangerous weapon.

22

But, if it is used in a manner that cannot inflict

23

the harm threatened, it cannot be seen as a dangerous weapon

24

unless you look just at the fear of the victims which is

25

certainly a concern.

QUESTION:

1

2

Do you say it is a charge to the jury

upon a question of fact then in every case?
MR. CRIBARI:

3

In every case the jury or the fact­

4

finder should have to make the finding that the weapon

5

was dangerous beyond a reasonable doubt, yes.
QUESTION:

6

You don't mean as a special verdict,

7

but they just be charged to look to find that as a fact

8

along with the —
MR. CRIBARI:

9

No.

That is correct, sir.

In the Fourth Circuit that is not what is done,

of course.

13

ment to present to the jury.

Because of the Bennett decision, if there is
And, there is no argu­

The fact that in this case Mr. McLaughlin had

an unloaded handgun, no bullets, could not have loaded

was a dangerous weapon when he admitted to the assault

19

using the handgun.

20

22

There was no argument to be made because that

QUESTION:

Your position is that a firearm is

never dangerous until it is loaded.
MR. CRIBARI:

No, sir, because the firearm could

23

certainly be used as a club.

It is not dangerous until

24

it is loaded or until it is used in some way that creates

25

a danger from its being there other than just the fear.

3

QUESTION:

Well, what if it is loaded, but he

doesn't find it necessary to pull the trigger.
MR. CRIBARI:

Well, then I think it is a dangerous

4

weapon because it can immediately inflict the harm that

5

it threatens.

6

QUESTION:

That is contrary to your earlier

7

definition used for the purpose intended; that is to kill

8

or wound somebody that resists.

9

MR. CRIBARI:

Well, I have no trouble reaching

10

the conclusion that a handgun that is loaded and operable

11

is immediately a dangerous weapon and can be found that

12

way by a jury simply on that evidence.

13

QUESTION:

Why isn't it dangerous because it

14

can be used as a club?

15

MR. CRIBARI:

Because — Unless there is evidence

16

that it was threatened to be used as a club, it wasn't

17

used as a club.

18

We look at someone with a handgun and we say,

19

well, that gun could be used as a club.

20

if the person uses it in such a way that there is no threat

21

that it is going to be used as a club, should we infer

22

since it is metal it could be used as a club?

23

Of course.

But,

If someone robs a bank carrying a heavy briefcase,

24

should we infer that since it is a heavy briefcase it could

25

be used as a bludgeon and, therefore, it is a dangerous

2

Once the gun ceases to be used as a gun, what

3

is it?

4

be used as a bludgeon.

5

that it was used as a bludgeon, was about to be used as

6

a bludgeon or that any threat was made to use it as a

7

bludgeon.

9

Certianly it is a heavy piece of metal that could
In this case, there is no evidence

In almost all of the cases that deal with the
bludgeon issue one of two things is present.

First of

10

all, it was used as a bludgeon.

11

year in the Wardy case the Second Circuit finds the gun

12

could be used as a bludgeon, it was used as a bludgeon,

13

and in addition t here was enough evidence from which

14

the factfinder could conclude it was loaded.

15

QUESTION:

Even as late as last

May I ask this question?

Assume

16

that instead of this case involving a revolver, which

17

found that it was, it was an automatic weapon like a

18

Let's say there were ten bullets in the clip but none had

19

been moved up into the barrel so it couldn't fe fired without

20

making that movement, would it be loaded?

21

MR. CRIBARI:

I think it would be loaded.

Colt 45.

I

22

think even if it isn't loaded, it can be loaded so quickly

23

that the distinction is meaningless.

24

be a factual question for the factfinder to give the evidence

25

of how that gun was at the time of the robbery, to hear

But, I think it should

1

testimony, if the defendant wants to testify, as to why

2

it wasn't loaded and make a decision.

3

QUESTION:

Or there is only one bullet in the

4

cylinder that holds six in a revolver and that bullet was

5

several cylinders away from the barrel, you would make

6

the same answer?

7

MR. CRIBARI:

The same answer.

I would conclude

8

that it was loaded, but I would also want to give in to

9

the factfinder to draw the conclusion of dangerousness.

10

In all of the state cases, virtually every state

11

case that is cited for the proposition that an unloaded

12

handgun is a dangerous weapon, there is involved a statute

13

making an unloaded handgun a dangerous weapon.

14

QUESTION:

Have the courts of appeals had occasion

15

to construe the word "assault" in Subsection (d)?

16

treated as the common law definition of assault as simply

17

pointing a weapon at someone is an assault?

18

MR. CRIBARI:

Is it

Let me answer by saying yes, but

19

I am going to say that the cases — the language in the

The Beasley case which Judge McCree's dissent

23

the dangerous weapon phrase applies to the assault clause

discusses common-law assault, discusses what an assault

is under (a) and says, as does Bradley and many of the

It is hard to imagine intimidation really

without a technical common-law assault.
MR. CRIBARI:

Well, it is, but it is not hard

to imagine it without a gun.

I think you do reach the

10

common-law assault, but when do you get from the assault

11

to the dangerous weapon?

QUESTION:

What about intent?

Suppose he had

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN J. CRIBARI, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — CONTINUED

7

MR. CRIBARI:

8

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

9

I would like to discuss briefly the second point

10

that I wanted to discuss today which is the Fourth Circuit's

11

decision in the Bennett case that establishes that a weapon,

12

loaded or unloaded, used during a bank robbery is a dangerous

13

weapon.

14

We think that is a violation of this Court's

15

decision in Winship because it takes from the government

16

the burden of having to prove beyond a reasonable doubt

17

that a weapon used in an assault during a bank robbery

18

is a dangerous weapon as a matter of fact.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

That assumes, Mr. Cribari, that Congress

intended it to be a question of fact in each case.
MR. CRIBARI:

It does indeed.

If Congress were

22

to pass a definitional statute saying unloaded handguns

23

are dangerous weapons within the purview of this Act we

24

are not here, but that is not there.

25

It is there in other firearms legislation.

It

1

is there in 924, but it is not there in 2113, and because

2

it is not there the Fourth Circuit shouldn't put it there.

3

It should leave the question, a question of fact for the

4

factfinder and not foreclose the factfinder from considering

5

all the circumstances involved in making a decision whether

6

that weapon was dangerous.

7

QUESTION:

Suppose the gun were loaded, either

8

a magazine or an automatic or a cylinder revolver, but

9

there was no firing pin.

10

MR. CRIBARI:

If there is no firing pin and the

11

weapon cannot function as a weapon, then I don't think

12

it is dangerous as a weapon.

13
14

QUESTION:

You mean if it can't function as a

firearm.

15

MR. CRIBARI:

As a firearm.

If it can't function

16

as the weapon it appears to be, unless it is used as a

17

different weapon.

we can determine from the facts regarding its uses as a

If the Court doesn't want to go that far and

the Court wants to leave that question about dangerousness

for the factfinder, that also is an acceptable position.

6

Either of those positions cut against the Fourth Circuit's

7

decision in Bennett.

8

QUESTION:

Well, your position would mean that

9

before the government could present the case they would

10

have to test the gun and see whether the firing pin was

11

really working.

12

MR. CRIBARI:

It might mean that.

It certainly

13

would mean the government could not sustain or might not

14

be able to sustain a verdict of guilty given evidence that

15

the person who used the gun knew the firing pin was defective.

16

In fact, the person who used the gun may have caused damage

17

to the firing pin just so no one would be injured by use

18

of the gun.

MR. CRIBARI:

1

Well, Justice Rehnquist, the cases

2

are clear, and once again we do not dispute the cases that

3

say from circumstantial evidence the jury would be warranted

4

in inferring the gun was loaded.

5

that at the time of the crime the gun was not loaded, and

6

there is the testimony from the victims, bystanders, or

7

whatever, it would be a question of fact first.
QUESTION:

That is true, but they can testify

the gun.

Yes, but the defendant, at the time

of the bank robbery, isn't going to tell the bystanders

22

it is not loaded.

23

MR. CRIBARI:

Of course not, which is why at

24

the very least we have a factual question for the factfinder.

25

Do we believe the testimony of the defendant, do we take

of this issue and the defendant either says nothing or

5

takes the stand and says it wasn't loaded.

6

say he was going to shoot us if we moved.

7

can testify to the fact that it was, in fact, loaded.

8

Is that enough to even take the case to the jury under

9

the reasonable doubt standard?

10

MR. CRIBARI:

The bystanders
None of them

My position would be that if the

11

evidence is conclusive that the weapon was not loaded,

12

no.

But, if it is a question of fact —

13

QUESTION:

Just the hypothesis I gave you.

Could

14

the judge charge the jury that they could find it was a

15

dangerous weapon with only the testimony from the bystanders

16

that the fellow brandished a gun at them.

17

MR. CRIBARI:

I think the matter could be submitted

18

to the jury with the instruction that from the evidence

19

you have heard, if you disbelieve the defendant and believe

20

the other testimony, you would be allowed to infer that

21

the weapon was loaded and operable.

22

must find beyond a reasonable doubt that it was a dangerous

weapon.

That is exactly what happened which

there is no distinction between (a) and (d).

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14

MR. WRIGHT:

15
16

The government's position is that an unloaded
gun is a dangerous weapon or device for two different reasons.
Our primary argument is that brandishing a gun

19

20

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

17
18

Mr. Wright?

during a bank robbery is likely to provoke violence.
Many courts have recognized that the display

21

22

of an apparently deadly weapon in the highly charged atmos­

23

phere of a bank during a robbery may lead to retaliation,

24

so that harm could occur in any of a number of different

25

ways.
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

As one of the many state courts that has held

2

that an unloaded gun is a dangerous weapon stated danger

3

invites -rescue and self-help.

4

The Fourth Circuit noted in the Bennett case

5

that frightened bystanders, security guards, or passing

6

police officers might take precipitous action that could

7

lead to harm to people in the bank at the time of the roberry.

8

It is, therefore, sensible to punish robbers

9

who display guns more severely than robbers who do not

10

and we think that that was Congress' goal in enacting Section

11

2113(d).

12

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, you take the position

then that a toy gun would also be a dangerous weapon?

14

MR. WRIGHT:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Whether a toy gun is a dangerous —
One that looks exactly like a real

gun.
MR. WRIGHT:

That is right.

It depends on what

18

it looks like.

19

just like a real gun, then we would contend that it is

20

a dangerous weapon or device under the statute because

21

its display is likely to provoke retaliation.

22

not look like a real gun, we would say it does not, and

23

there might be a question of fact in such a case for a

24

jury unlike this case where it is contested that this was

25

a real handgun.

If it looks just like a dangerous weapon,

QUESTION:

What if all the bystanders were near­

sighted so they thought that the gun really was threatening,

realized it was a toy gun.

be a factual question for the jury and the nearsightedness

of the bystanders would be relevant in such a case.

QUESTION:

What about a toothbrush in the pocket

it is made out of paper mache.
MR. WRIGHT:

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

we think that the display of a toy gun, assuming it looks

2

somewhat real, would make it a dangerous device.

3

QUESTION:

What if you had a toy gun but you

4

didn't take it out of your pocket.

5

the likelihood that there is a real gun in there.

6

your theory would apply.

7

MR. WRIGHT:

It still manifests
I think

We contend that if the gun is never

8

brandished that that is not the use of a weapon to assault

9

anyone within the meaning of the statute and we do not

10

contend that it applies — that the additional punishment

11

of Section 2113(d) would be warranted in such a case.

12

That is one of the many cases where we think Subsection

13

(a) would apply, but not Subsection (d).

14
15
16

QUESTION:

A toy gun is enough provided they

see the toy gun.
MR. WRIGHT:

We think under our view — We believe

17

that the brandishing of the weapon is quite important.

18

We think that is what is likely to provoke retaliation.

19

We think that a finger in a pocket or a toothbrush in the

20

pocket simply is not nearly as likely to provoke retaliation.

21

Bystanders may well not notice the fact that a robbery

22

is going on at all as was the case in the Brown case which

23

we have cited in our brief.

MR. WRIGHT:

2
3

You have to use the weapon to assault

someone.

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MR. WRIGHT:

6

Petitioner agrees, in his brief at page

That is right.
2, that

7

displaying an unloaded gun during a robbery is dangerous,

8

but argues that Congress did not intend to punish bank

9

robbers who create dangerous situations because Section

10

2

3(d) refers only to dangerous weapons or devices.
We disagree.

11
12

It seems obvious that Congress

enacted that aggrevated bank robbery provision in order

3

to give enhanced punishment to robbers who act in ways

4

that are more likely to create serious injury.
Furthermore, Petitioner neglects that Section

5
6

2

3(d) refers to devices as well as to weapons.
As the legislative history shows, Congress was

7
8

concerned with the psychological effect of the display

9

of a weapon on the minds of people in the bank at the time

20

of the robbery and added the word device in order to make

21

it clear.

22

As a secondary argument, we contend that an unloaded

23

gun is a dangerous weapon or device within the meaning

24

of the statute because it may be used as a bludgeon as

25

a California court noted more than 50 years ago and as

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

a number of courts have noted since.
The display of a gun, whether loaded or unloaded,

3

is a threat to inflict injury by means of beating someone

4

and a robber displaying a gun is capable of carrying out

5

that threat.

6

To make our position clear, I would like to

7

consider one other example raised by Justice Marshall.

8

He asked whether a metal club is a dangerous weapon.

9

think that clearly it is.

10

We

We also think it is worth noting that a metal

11

club is not nearly as useful as a weapon even if just used

Brandishing a metal club in contrast is much

17

less likely to cause a robber to remain stationary.

18

that is why we think robbers use unloaded guns rather than

19

metal clubs in robbing banks.

So,

20

The legislative history confirms that Congress

21

intended Section 2113(d) to prescribe the use of weapons

22

having the apparent capability of inflicting harm.

23

The words "or device" were added to that part

24

of the bill that became Subsection (d) after an enlightening

25

floor exchange.

Representative Blanton feared that courts would

2

not construe the phrase "dangerous weapon" broadly to cover

3

devices such as fake bombs and fake guns and he proposed

4

amending the provision to add the word "device" in order

5

to make clear that it ought to apply in such circumstances.

6

In fact, as an example of the sort of instrument

7

that he thought ought to be covered, he referred to "one

8

of those new kind of Indiana six shooters carved out of

9

a piece of wood with a pocket knife."

10

He also noted that a bottle of water asserted

11

to be nitroglycerin would have the same effect psychologically

12

on the minds of the people in the bank as a real bomb.

13

This legislative history which, to our knowledge,

14

has not been cited by any court, including the district

15

court in California that ruled contrary to us on this

16

question, and we think that it clearly shows that Congress

17

intended that a dangerous — that an unloaded gun would

18

be a dangerous weapon because it has the apparent capability

19

of inflicting harm.

20

QUESTION:

It seems to me the legislative history

21

cuts a little bit against that because if Congress thought

22

that an unloaded gun would be a dangerous weapon, it

23

presumably would have thought the Indiana six shooter would

24

also be a dangerous weapon, don't you think?

25

MR. WRIGHT:

I think that that is right.

QUESTION:

Then why did they feel it necessary

to add the word "device"?

3

MR. WRIGHT:

Representative Blanton explained —

You appear to be looking at the reply brief, Justice

5

Rehnquist.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. WRIGHT:

That is the wrong source.
No.

The exchange covered there

8

is Representative Blanton has proposed the addition of

9

the words "and device."

And, as an example, he says that

10

it would cover something like an Indiana six shooter.

11

Representative Sumners then says, I think that is already

12

covered by Section 2 which is now Subsection(b) of the

13

bank larceny provision.

14

But, the point is Representative Blanton wanted

15

Subsection (d) to cover that situation and he went on to

16

propose the amendment which was passed by Congress that

17

added the words "or device" to what is now Subsection(d)

18

so that Subsection(d) applies in cases of fake guns and

19

fake bombs and we submit unloaded guns as well.

20

QUESTION:

Then is the government's basic argument

21

here that although the unloaded gun is not a dangerous

22

weapon, it is a dangerous device?

23
24
25

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, we would argue that an unloaded

gun is a dangerous weapon as eight of the nine state courts —

history, do you?
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, no, that is right, we don't.

3

But, we think the addition of the words "or device"

4

accompanied by the explanatory exchange between Representa­

5

tive Blanton and the other congressmen makes quite clear

6

that Congress — Representative Elanton proposed to add

7

those words in case courts did not think dangerous weapon

8

would apply in cases such as fake bombs and fake guns.

9

make it perfectly clear that he added the words "or device"

10
11

to the statute.
We would contend that an unloaded gun is a

12

dangerous weapon without that addition.

13

it seems to us beyond doubt that an unloaded gun is a

14

dangerous weapon.

With that addition

May I ask you on your bludgeon theory,

MR. WRIGHT:

It seems to us that that may well

22

present a fact question.

24

use as a bludgeon —

MR. WRIGHT:

I wonder if there is anything

Well, we don't know exactly why

the judge ruled it was a dangerous weapon.
QUESTION:

12

Isn't it correct, as your opponent

13

suggests in the colloquy, that they thought the Fourth

14

Circuit law was a gun being capable of being fired is a

15

dangerous weapon even if there are no bullets in it.

16

MR. WRIGHT:

That is correct.

And, the companion

17

case, Johnson, which the court is holding, was a jury trial

18

and attached to the petition there are the jury instructions

19

that were given in that case which focus on the apparent

20

capability of the weapon to inflict harm, which I presume

21

the judge felt was the test, although he did not state

22

it.

23

QUESTION:

There would be nothing in the record

to show whether this gun is capable of being used as a

I would add that it would seem to me it would only be the

quite unusual weapon on which we have no evidence in the

that the judge here decided it was a dangerous weapon,

14

MR. WRIGHT:

15

Contrary to Petitioner's argument and the argument

I think that is right, Justice.

16

accepted by the district court in California that ruled

17

contrary to the government, interpretation of the aggravated

18

bank robbery provision to cover unloaded guns and fake

19

weapons does not render redundant Section 2113(a), the

20

straight bank robbery provision.

21

Aggravated bank robbery, which is punishable

22

by five more years imprisonment than straight bank robbery,

23

differs from straight bank robbery in that a dangerous

24

weapon or device must be used to assault someone during

25

the course of a robbery.

That has not rendered their second degree

(202) 628-9300

1

construed the phrase "dangerous weapon", or nearly

2

unanimously — there was one case that went the other way —

3

supports our contention that such an interpretation com­

4

ports with the plain meaning of the phrase, and, as I mentione

5

before, even in the absence of the strong legislative history

6

in this case, we would so contend.

7

Petitioner has suggested in his reply brief that

8

the eight state cases we have cited are not relevant because

9

the evidence in those cases showed that the gun was used

10

as a bludgeon or because a state statute in effect defined

11

an unloaded gun as a dangerous weapon or because there

12

was evidence that the gun might have been loaded.

13

In one of the cases we cited, the Nichols case

14

from Iowa, the court did, in fact, rely on a definitional

15

statute.

16

In two of the cases, the Aranda case from

17

California and the Montano case from New Mexico, there

18

was some evidence showing that the gun may have been loaded,

19

but we cited those cases because the courts in those cases

20

made absolutely clear that whether or not the gun was loaded

21

made no difference in their holding.

22

In the other five cases, there was no evidence

23

that the gun was used as a bludgeon.

24

25

even attempting to show that the gun was unloaded, and

There was no reliance

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the courts nevertheless held that the unloaded gun was

2

a dangerous weapon when used in a robbery.
The experience in the one state where a court

3
4

held that an unloaded gun is not a dangerous weapon when

5

used in a robbery is also instructive.

6

in that state, Wisconsin, subsequently amended the state

7

statute so that it now applies to "any article used or

8

fashioned in a manner to lead the victim to reasonably

9

believe that it is a dangerous weapon."

10

The legislature

As we noted in our brief, 15 other states have

11

statutes that on their face appear to apply in the case

12

of an unloaded gun.

13

To be sure, Petitioner pointed out, those reflect

14

legislative judgments, but we cite them to show that it

15

is sensible to construe robbery statutes to punish robbers

16

who brandish weapons more severely than robbers who do

17

not.

18

It appears that the vast majority of the states-

19

that have considered that question have, like Congress,

20

come to that conclusion.

21

In summary, the United States contends that an

22

unloaded gun is a dangerous weapon or device within the

23

meaning of Section 2113(d) because its display is likely

24

to provoke retaliation.

25

In addition, an unloaded gun is a dangerous weapon
42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

or device because it can be used as a bludgeon to inflict

2

harm.

3

The addition of the words "or device" to that

4

part of the statute that became Section 2113(d) makes that

5

clear.

6

then a real gun that is not loaded surely is.

If an Indiana six shooter is a dangerous weapon,

7

Our construction of Subsection (d) does not render

8

Subsection (a) redundant any more than the many state statutes

9

and cases holding that an unloaded gun is a dangerous weapon

10

under a first degree robbery statute makes the second degree

11

statutes superfluous.

12

And, as the overwhelming weight of authority

13

in favor of our view shows this position makes sense. It

14

makes sense to punish a robber who brandishes a weapon

15

more severely than one who does not whether or not the

16

robber's gun was loaded.

That is why we have 924(c) which punishes

2113(d) punishes the use of a dangerous weapon

4

during an assault committed during a bank robbery or used

5

to place life in jeopardy during a bank robbery.

6

This Court referred to the legislative history

7

of 2113(d) in its footnote in Simpson and it explained

8

that dangerous weapon applies equally to the assaultive

9

and jeopardy clauses and it notes that 2113(d) was enacted

10

to fight gangsterism in the 1930's.

11

the mind of Congress was to punish people who use weapons

12

that can shoot people, that can explode, and that weapons

13

that look like them are not punished as devices but are

14

punished under the fear section of that statute.

What was clearly in

entirely.
