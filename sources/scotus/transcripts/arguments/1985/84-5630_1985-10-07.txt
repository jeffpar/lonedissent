because the ultimate decisionmaking rests with the

United States District Court.

3

came up with three points.

4

Those cases basically

One, in going over the legislative history of

5

the Magistrates Act, this Court has said Congress was

6

sensitive to the Article 3 considerations.

7

sensitive to not putting in a magistrate Article 3

8

duties. Hence this Court stressed and Congress stressed

9

that the ultimate adjudicatory determination was

They were

reserved to the District Court.
The second point this Court has made in

12

Raddatz and Mathews is,

13

authority and responsibility to make an informed formal

14

determination must remain with the Judge.

15

the Court says that the ultimate

16

role is one of helping the Court to narrow the dispute,

stressed the Co irt alone remains the ultimate

decisionmaker.

It seems that this Court has quite clearly said the

That raises a magistrate to the ultimate
decisiomaker in a case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Stanley, if you are right that

14

Raddatz and the other case stand for the proposition

15

that the District Coirt is an independent adjudicator,

16

the adoption of your view would really allow counsel

17

losing before the magistrate to simply go directly to

18

the Court of Appeals without even paying any attention

19

to the District Court.

20

MR. STANLEY:

Well,

I disagree with you.

21

Justice Pehnguist.

First of all, the magistrate's

22

report is not a final appealable order.

23

writing the statute says, if there are no objections,

24

the District Court doesn't have to make a de novo

25

review, but the District Court still must consider the

But the District Court would

be even more focused if it had the benefit cf objections

to the magistrate's report from the losing party.
HR. STANLEY;

9

I am not going tc disagree with

10

you. Your Honor.

11

in this case, where I had filed a 20-page brief, the

12

issues were before the Court.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

the reason that it is constitutional is that the

2

3

QUESTIONS

Well, it always is.

4

MR. STANLEY;

That's correct,

and since the

5

District Court must review the magistrate’s report,

whetner objections are filed or not, it seems to me that

the Walters policy and the other circuits are wrong when

they say that there is a waiver of the right to appeal,

I would agree with you.

remaining 13 minites -QUESTION;

May I ask one question before you

go to your second point?

21

MR. STANLEY;

22

QUESTION;

Certainly.

Do you understand

the Sixth Circuit

23

rule to be that they think the statute compels a waiver,

24

or that as a matter of practice in the Sixth Circiut we

25

will enforce the waiver rule?

PE. STANLEY:

Well,

their writing, the

2

language that they said was, although you may file

--objections is something that you may cr may not do, we

4

feel they felt that under the supervisor power they

5

could force this issue by making it a rule in the Sixth

Circuit.

7

Justice Stevens, is the fact that different circuits

8

have different rules for jurisdiction, and if we go to

9

what was going to be my third point, which is that the

One of the dangers of that in my opinion,

10

courts cannot limit their own jurisdiction that Congress

11

has given them, in different circuits some people can

12

appeal.

13

matter what the magistrate does, whether or not you file

14

objections or not, you can appeal from the denial of a

In four of the circuits you can appeal no

1

MR. STANLEY;

Hopefully not.

2

My second argument is a due process argument

3

as it was enunciated in United States versus Raddatz by

4

the Chief Justice, which basically says that what due

5

process you are entitled to is appropriate to

6

of the case.

into the question of private interests,

8

erroneous determination by reason and process supported,

9

and the public interest in administrative burdens.

the nature

Citing Mathews versus Aldridge, it goes
the risk of

10

It seems to me that when we are talking about

11

the great petition of habeas corpus, and where Congress

12

has required the right to appeal as giving you that

13

right, that due process requires in habeas corpus that

14

the ultimate decisionmaking be with the District Court,

15

and that the r .ght to appeal be given to a petitioner.
I have already mentioned in reference to

16
17

Justice Stevens* argument my fourth point, which is that

18

I do not belifve that the courts can limit their own

19

jurisdiction.
I would say that in summation,’ that Walters is

20
21

wrong because it limits their jurisdiction.

Some Circuit Courts have had
