Mr. Burnham,

you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BURNHAM, ESQ.,
Oi! BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. BURNHAM*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9
and may it please the Court, I would like tc reserve
10

five minutes of my time for rebuttal.
11

This case is actually comprised of two Section
12

1983 class actions.

The claims in the cases are

13
essentially that the defendant state official violated
14
the plaintiff's statutory rights under Title 4(d) of the
15
Sccial Security Act, thereby depriving them of AFDC
16
benefits tc which they were entitled.
17
The two cases factually parallel each other.
18
However, I will indicate briefly what those were.
19

cases were filed in 1980 and 1981.

The

The first case,

20

denominated Michigan Welfare Rights Organization versus

21

Dempsey oriainally, is the child care expense case, in

22

which Michigan in concluding an AFDC budget refused to

23

allow a deduction for the expenses of child care which

24

were necessary to be paid for the recipient tc go tc

Well,

the case is not moot.

It

In order to

12

indication of how that case was still alive, in that

case this Court affirmed an en banc Seventh Circuit

decision saying that notice really should be ordered,

MR. BURNHAHs

2

Well, Justice Powell, the

If -that is correct, do you have an analogy

MR. 8URNKA* t

I believe -- Your Honor, I

2

believe, is referring to the statement in Quern about

3

the notice being ancillary to prospective relief already

4

ordered.

5

QUESTION*

Yes.

6

MR. BURNHAMs

The defendant’s and the Sixth

7

Circuit’s interpretation of that is that that referred

8

to the permanent injunction, which of course had in the

9

intervening time become moot because of

the abolition of

10

the program to which it related.

11

that phrase simply refers to the way that the word

12

"ancillary" is used in Eleventh Amendment

13

jurispru dence.

It is our view that

In other words, a full statement distinguishes

14

between the notice that

was approved by the en banc

15

Court of Appeals and the notice that was approved by the
16

District Court.

And the court was in essence saying the

17

notice approved by the District Court was net ancillary,
18

tut the notice cf proof by the Court of

Appeals was

19

ancillar y.
20

Well, if in fact the Sixth Circuit’s reading
21

of ancillary is correct, that would make no sense,
22

because those notices,

the only difference in the

23

notices was the form of the notice, and

the fact that it

24

could be ordered, was the same in both situations, both

in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals.
Consequently, taking that data, it is quite

2
3

clear that it could not hava referred to ancillary power

4

tc enter that kind of relief.

the usual meaning of ancillary, which is that the effect

6

of that relief was ancillary to a proper substantive

17

QUESTION;

What are you sa yina?

18

MR. BUPKHAN;

What I am saying is tha-t in

19

order to be prospective, the relief must be based upon
20

seme ongoing federal duty, and if there is an ongoing
21

federal duty to take action with respect to past claims,
22

which there is in the federal statute and the federal
23

regulations, then an order enforcing that ongoing duty
24

can in fact be prospective.

argument that was made tc this Court in Cuern, that in

QUESTIONS

1

This case dees cause one tc wonder

2

whether the declaratory judgment isn't being sought in

3

effect to determine liability, and just leave

4

enforceability to state courts to determine statutory

5

time bars or that sort of thing.

6

MR. BURNHAM;

Well,

that is an important

7

point.

T believe it is important to emphasize that a

8

declaratory judgment does not establish any state

9

liability for payment of anything.

I

It simply

10

establishes that the state through its regulation

11

violated federal law in the past, but the consequences

12

are of that determination --

13

QUESTION;

Well,

that is the point.

If the

14

stats has violated federal law and the declaratory

15

judgment reveals that paynent should have been made

16

under federal law, then that in effect determines state

17

liability, and what is left is really a determination in

what the statute of limitations might provide or what

HR. BURNHM:

It would be petitioners*

3

position that the same description of the effect of

and that would be that the chain of causation is clearly

severed, and that it is in fact up to the state as to

whether or not — what they do with this substantive

federal question determination, that they may in fact

MR. BURMHAMs

4

In essence that would be the

only place that the plaintiffs could gc.
correct.

That is

Under the circumstances of this case,

v

plaintiffs believe that the District Court/ that the
5

Sixth Circuit decision is completely contrary to the
6

rule of Ex Parte Young and the rule of Edelman versus
7

Jordan .
8

Ex Parte Young in essence held that a suit
9

against a state officer is in fact net a suit against a
10

state, but Ford Motor Company and Edelman, of course,
11

make it clear that if in fact monetary relief is sought,
12

then that pierces the fiction of Ex Parte Young, and it
13

again may become a suit against the state.
14

1nder the circumstances here,

the Court in

15

Quern has

iuite clearly held that notice relief, this

16

kind of

relief, is not a money judgment, and

17

consequently the Fori Motor Company exception does not
18

apply to that.

Consequently, it should be treated no

19

differently than any ether kind of injunctive relief,
20

and after all, it is an injunction.

It is an order to

21

the state that they in fact provide certain kinds of
22

notices to the plaintiff class members.
23

And under the circumstances, it should not be
24

deemed to violate the Eleventh Amendment.

Indeed,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

the

1

Ex Farte Young Court mentions the situation of habeas

2

corpus relief, which is a situation where obviously

3

there is a determination that in the past the state

4

officials violated the federal rights of the plaintiff.
However, the Court indicated that that was net

5

6

a violation of the Eleventh Amendment.

7

indication to petitioners that Ex Parte Young was net as

8

That is a clear

narrow as the Sixth Circuit would say it was.

In other

words, it did not just provide for prospective
9

injunction against ongoing violations.
10

In fact, it contemplated explicitly a
11

determination of past misconduct, and of course that in
12

modern Eleventh Amendment parlance, the habeas corpus
13

writ would not violate the Eleventh Amendment simply
14

because there was no impact on the state treasury in.
15

that situation.

That is like the expunction case

That

16

is like the public employee record expuncticn
17

situation.

It is non-monetary relief, albeit basud upon

18

a past determination of misconduct, and that is
19

permitted by the Eleventh Amendment.
20

The final point I would like to mention is
21

that the reading of the Sixth Circuit in this case of Ex
22

Parte Young gives the state a

virtually limitless power

23

to control the jurisdiction of the District Court.
24

There was a great deal of delay in these cases, and of

The state can quite easily have an incentive

tc look

6

they do that, then they wipe out any past claim for the

7

back benefits.

If

That sort of control over the court’s

8
9

to delay because they can simply avoid any

jurisdiction quite clearly should not be allowed.

The

10

facts of this case, in fact the stepparert violation

11

that we believe is — the state is engaged in right now,

12

quite clearly the state could render that issue Quite
moot by saying, okay,

we know the stakes are high in

13

this case because an order could be ancillary tc that
14

ongoing injunction.
15

Consequently,

we will decide that we will

16

comply.

That would then divest the District Court of

17

jurisdiction, and under the ancillary theory of Quern
18

there would be no basis for ordering a notice relief
19

remedy.
20

That sort of power should not be allowed, and
21

it doesn’t make any sense, simply because the issue of
22

future violations and the issue of past violations are
23

two rather distinct things.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

that would be the case when you consider the nature of a

2

declaratory judgment.

A declaratory judgment under the

O

'1

Act :s a final judgment, and it adjudicates the rights

4

of the parties involved, and it is an actual case in

5

controversy, and it would cover a period here when the

6

respondent was not under a final court imposed

7

obligation to comport her conduct with different

8

standards.
Now,

9

this becomes quite evident when you

consider the ancillary notices that were considered in
10

Quern and in Edelman and in Trainor v. Jordan.

The

11

^irst notice was rejected by the court.

After rejecting

12

the first notice, they approved a notice that merely
13

advised the class that the court described as one that
14

simply informed the class that the federal suit is at an
15

end and

the federal court can provide no further relief,

16

and if they may wish to pursue state administrative
17

remedies, they may do this.
18

But this kind of notice, the Court said,
19

didn't impose any retroactive liability.

It was in no

20

way handicapped by a federal court determination of
21

state liability, and in that case, in the case, in the
22

Quern case, there was an adjudication by the court of
23

misconduct, and

thera was a prospective compliance order

24

entered in that court, and we don't have that situation

ME. CARUSO;

That is correct.

that this is what the statute means, this is what the

state is not doing, and therefore you need an

MR. CARUSO:

What is it?

requires -QUESTION;

-- that the state is violating the

15

law, and therefore it is an injunction.
16

MR. CARUSO;

If that is a declaration of the

17

violation of the law that is occurring at that time, it
18

would not be prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment.
19

Based upon that declaration of violation an injunction
20

could be entered under the Eleventh — and not violate
21

the Eleventh Amendment as to prospective compliance.
22

QUESTION;

And in Justice Stevens* example,

suppose six months before this law was changed —

MR. CARUSO;

Yes.

the new statute that says you doji't have to fellow this

procedure any more, and

so the state goes in or its

I don’t believe if would require

think, probably would have to be the past violation, but

that the respondent does not seek any decision here that

But, Mr. Caruso, it is true that

8

your position is that whatever federal question of law

has to be decided ought to be decided by the state

MR. CARUSO;

Not every federal question of

12

law, but in this situation, the type of relief that they

13

are seeking here should be decided in state court

14

because the type of relief that is available to them

15

because of the Eleventh Amendment immunity is only a

16

prospective injunction, and a prospective injunction is

17

net available here simply because there is no violation

18

of federal law, and theie has never been a determinati/R

made by a federal court that there was at any time a

violation of federal law.
