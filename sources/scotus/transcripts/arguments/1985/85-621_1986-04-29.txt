ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESC-,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

IN NO. 85-621

10

MR. WALLACE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the Court, this is a case in which the respondent

12

is claiming a right to an Article III adjudication in a

13

situation where he was afforded that right ty the

14

governing statute, but elected instead to use an

15

administrative remedy provided by Congress as a

16

convenient alternative.

17

something of a claim that the Constitution should

18

protect him against himself and against the election of

19

remedies that he exercised.

20

In ether words, it amounts to

The 1974 amendments to the Commodities

21

Exchange Act created the Commodities Futures Trading

22

Commission and directed it to establish a reparations

23

procedure for administrative adjudication of disputes

24

between brokers and their customers, and as we have

25

shown in our brief, more than 8,000 such disputes which

2

have been disposed of through this administrative remedy

3

since it went into effect.

4

From the outset, the implementing regulations

5

provided that counterclaims arising cut of the same

6

transaction cculd be asserted in the course of the

7

adminstrative remedy.

8

pursuant to the very broad grant of authority in the

9

statute for the Commission to adopt regulations not only

The counterclaim regulation was

10

to effectuate the provisions of the Act but also to

11

accomplish any of the Act's purposes, and as we have

12

detailed in our brief, the Act itself referred to

13

counterclaims.

obviously contemplated that

13

The counterclaim arose in the following way.

14

Before the broker had noticed that the reparations

15

complaint had been filed, it had filed a diversity

16

action in the federal court

17

owing on its account, and the respondent, the customer

18

filed a counterclaim repeating its fraud charges to that

action, tut also

10

with respect tc the transactions; Number 5, that

15

Respondent alleged two reasons why the court

16

remedy.

18

Procedure, it was reguired to assert the same claims it

19

was asserting before the Commission as a counterclaim tc

20

the court suit, because it arose out of the same

21

transaction,

22

into the federal court if the federal court suit went

23

ahead, and the other one was that in any event it wculd

24

be reguired at great ccst and inconvenience tc litigate

25

the issues before two different forums, and then the

One was that under the Federal Rules cf Civil

final sentence of Paragraph 6, which reads like a

2

sentence out cf the brief we have filed, "The effect

3

therefore would be to emasculate if net destroy the

4

purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act to previde an

5

efficient and relatively inexpensive forum for the

6

resolution of disputes in futures trading."

7

Now, as is also typical in these cases, the

8

counterclaim involved no additional factual issue ether

9

than the question whether the fraud alleged in the

10

administrative complaint had occurred.

11

cf the debit lalance on the account was undisputed, and

12

the counterclaim involved no disputed legal issue.

13

was simply a way fully to resolve the dispute over the

14

contested transactions in a single proceeding.

QUESTION:

23

are subject tc de novo review on a state, legal issue in

15

MR. WALLACE:

Here you are having a dispute

That is true.

For the

16

convenience of persons participating in the commodities

17

market, Congress has exercised its Article I powers to

18

provide an expert administrative tribunal which can

19

serve by consent to resolve their disputes pursuant tc

20

administrative procedures with a greater scope of

21

judicial review than the Article III courts and would be

22

true of arbitrators who would be less expert in the

23

field, and the parties have the option of going to an

24

Article III court rather than utilizing that procedure.

25

QUESTION:

Now, in this Court respondent has presented us

with something of a moving target by arguing principally

15

that it is not his own rights but states' rights that

are offended by his action of the administrative

remedy.

the counterclaim involved no additional disputed issue
