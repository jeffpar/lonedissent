ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEES,

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

MR. BRUCXi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, in this case the petitioner, Ronald

11

Skipper, was convicted of murder and rape in the South

12

Carolina Supreme Court, and was sentenced to death.

13

his sentencing hearing before the trial jury, one of the

14

mitigating factors which he attempted

15

jury's consideration was evidence of his past good

conduct and successful adaptation to a jail environment

18

his arrest and the time of his trial.

He attempted to prove this obviously for the

19

20

purpose of persuading the jury whose sole decision of

21

the sentencing phase was whether to send him to prison

for life or whether to sentence him to death, that if he

23

were sentenced to life instead of death, he could be

QUESTION*

2

Mr. Bruck., does the record disclose

3

by an offer of proof or

4

that the evidence of the two corrections officers, if

5

that is what we are dealing with, would have consisted

6

of?
MR. BRUCKs

7

otherwise exactly what it is

In terms of an offer of their

8

testimony on the witness stand in camera, no, it does

9

not.

This proffer, the proffer is contained primarily

10

at Page

11 of the Joint Appendix, and it is counsel

11

standing in place and

12

what the witnesses would say.

13

Your Honor, two jailers to testify that the defendant

14

has made a good adjustment, and at that point the court

15

says that that issue is not relevant.

16

testimony is not in tha record.

The actual

For our purposes, we should

18

consider what the evidence wouxd have been to have

19

consisted cnly of past conduct while incarcerated, is

20

that correct, without an element of prediction of future

21

conduct?

22

MR. BRUCK*

Yes, that is what was proferred.

23

It is that he made a good adjustment.

It was obviously

24

beinq offered for the purpose of permitting the

25

sentencing authority to draw the conclusion about his

The South Carolina Supreme Court seemed

QUESTIONS

Now, under present South Carolina

law, do I understand correctly that the state would new

5

permit such evidence to be introduced?

6

HR. BRUCKt

Yes, Your Honor, but for a very

7

limitei purpose.

8

again adhered to the position first expressed in Koon I,

9

which was the basis of the ruling here that the issue of

South Carolina has again and again and

10

the future good conduct of a defendant in prison is

11

irreleva nt.

12

However, in Koon II , a case decided

13

year after this trial, and thus of no relevance to what

14

happened here, the Court said

15

jail is admissible but only as general evidence of the

16

good character of the defendant.

17

on the issue of good conduct in jail, whicn the Court

18

has continued over and over again to say is

19

inadmissible, and proof of that, our position is that

20

the South Carolina Supreme Court has repeatedly,

21

beginning with Koon I and as recently as State against

22

Chaffee, cited in my brief, upheld the exclusion of

23

expert psychiatric testimony which was focusing solely

24

on whether or not based on a psychiatric evaluation of

25

this defendant his likely future conduct in prison would

has never been a case in which a psychiatrist offering

HR. BBDCK

For a very limited purpose, a

2

purpose so limited that South Carolina has almost

3

invariably found exclusion to be harmless error in all

4

but one case since this time.

5

QUESTION*

You tell me now that South Carolina

6

would always exclude the testimony of an expert if he

7

purported to predict how the prisoner would act.

8
9

HR. BRUCKs

That’s correct.

That's correct.

There are, I think, three or four decisions that have

10

been filed in the South Carolina Supreme Court dealing

11

with not past testimony of guards, but --

12
13

QUESTION*

Well, do you understand the state's

submission now to ba to the contrary?

14

HR. BRUCKs

Well, yes.

As a matter of fact,

15

the state seems at some point in its brief to say in the

16

teeth of all of the South Carolina decisions that in

17

fact the rule of State against Koon isn’t really such a

18

rule, and that all South Carolina e.vcludes is

incompetent lay opinion testimony.

Their observations,

what they saw, not neoessarily their opinions, but what

they saw over seven-and-a-half months of day-to-day

conduct with this man would most certainly have been

character and enabling the jury to make an intelligent

11

to confront.
QUESTION;

What if the state did not make

12

future dangerousness an element of the sentencing

process in any way.

would require South Carolina to admit the sort of

First, I think that all of this Court's capital

21

dangerousness, cf future behavior, whether it be bad or

22

good, the capacity for rehabilitation is at the very

23

cere of what American judges and juries do when they

pass sentence in all kinds of cases, and this Court's

cases go back half a century and more discussing that

In Lockett itself, one of the mitigating

QUESTION*

I notice you rely a great deal on

Lockett when it refers to aspects of the defendant's

character and record.

when were the character and record of this man made,

before he committed the crime or after he committed the

I read Lockett to say both.
Do you think Lockett contemplated

MR. BEUCKs

16
17

That is my reading.
Hall, isn't character an evaluation

of past conduct?
MR. BRUCK*

It is partly that, and it is

18

partly an evaluation —

the jury cannot avoid the

I would suggest that that would be

answer would be that the weight to be accorded to

Lockett and all that Eddings say is that the state may

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER,

7

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT - RESUMED

8

MR. BRUCK:

Thank you. Your Honor.

9

If I may complete my response to Justice

10

Shite, I think basically petitioner's position would be

11

that where a lay witness is permitted to give all of his

12

observations and pro/iie all of what he has to say based

13

on his own knowledge and experience and what he had

14

seen, the Constitution would

15

witness's opinion also be admitted in mitigation of

16

punishment.

MR. BRUCK*

22

is based on special experience.

QUESTION*

But a state, if it permits the

wouldn't need tc permit an opinion from him.

beginning, has to do with what the jury actually is

required — what is actually required of the jury at the

sentencing phase.

6

any sentencing authority muse predict a convicted

7

person's probable future conduct when it engages in the

8

process of determining

9

simply an inquiry which cannot be willed away.

As the joint opinion in Jurek stated,

Amendment, and if we are to sentence people tc death,

facts as best we can bring them to the sentencer’s

attention.

16

I read Lockett to be concerned with accuracy,

Let it be only based on the

What we haze here in this case, I think, is an

17

exceptionally clear example of the sentencing

18

determination fraught with the potential for error,

19

because not only were the state's own witnesses, the

20

jail guards, who knew the most about how this man was

likely to do in prison,

behavior during the two months between the time cf the

think that would again be

who suffer from character disorders, and ther*- was

being offered to cite what the record clearly shows is

2

some sort of incompetent lay opinion testimony.

3

was no reason for the state to make any such argument,

4

because South Carolina law is so clear that the issue of

5

future conduct in prison at least when the behavior is

6

likely to be good is inadmissible as a matter of law and

7

is categorically excluded.
That is what State against Koon said, the

14

I don't think that has anything to do with how

17

The problem with the written

That is the reason -I suppcs'

you could say

that, but I don’t think it is entirely fair to say that

5

the trial court rule! absolutely consistently

throughout.
MR. BFUCK*

7

The main point I really got to my

8

feet again to make was simply in the answer to Justice

9

O'Connor’s questions and the answers to Justice Steven’s

10

question were not correct.

That the state gave the law

11

in South Carolina could not be clearer that the issue of

12

future good conduct in prison is inadmissible as a

13

matter of law.

14

Court cited Koon I in saying that evidence of future

15

adjustability or adaptability to prison was properly

16

excluded.

In this case, the South Carolina Supreme

17

ft few months later, in State against Elmore,

18

the case — the South Carolina court made rn identical

19

ruling based purely -- .n a case which involved only the

20

exclusion of three prison guards who had had this man

21

for two years, and when the South Carolina Supreme Court

22

upheld the exclusion of that testimony, solely evidence

23

that there is prior good conduct, the state court cited

24

State against Skipper as ther authority, so I don’t

25

think there is any question about what South Carolina

Hy last point that I would like to make is

3

simply that the state in a — at the last moment said

4

that the evidence here is harmless.

5

never suggested that an actual violation the rule of

6

Lockett against Ohio,

7

14

state made which he was prevented from responding to

15

and on that basis we submit that this death sentence may
