ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITS A. JONES, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. JONESi

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and

10

may it please the Court, this case arises from the crash

11

of a helicopter on the high seas.

12

the Gulf of Mexico, approximately 35 miles from land.

13

All persons on boarl were killel.

14

helicopter, Offshore Loqistics, conceded in the District

15

Court that it is lisble for damages under the Federal

16

Death on the High Seas Act, which is known by its

17

acronym DOHSA.

19

nonpecuniary or sentimental damages.

That holding defines the core issue

We submit that Plaintiffs cannot prevail in

14

this case unless Section 7 affirmatively directs federal

15

admiralty courts to enforce state wrongful death

16

statutes on the high seas.

17

Section 7 issues no such directive.

18

We further submit that

Before I turn to the construction of Section

19

7, let me begin by assuming that for purposes of

20

argument that Section 7 is merely neutral, that it

21

neither prohibits nor requires the enforcement of state

22

law on the high seas.

23

state law will be left for judicial determination in

24

accordance with the governing principles of admiralty,

25

and there can be no sericus question about the outcome.

to be sail about what Reprasantative Mann had

in mind , .

25

but let me first point out that for 60 years following

1

the enactment of DOHSA, this language of Section 7 has

2

been treated by all leading admiralty commentators as

3

nothing more than a sa/ing clause, as providing nothing

4

mere than that state law may be used where federal law,

5

where the federal remedy does not apply.

6

QUESTION*

7

HR. JONES:

Like the saving to suitors clause?
Well, the saving to suitors clause

8

basically is a provision that permits the use of a state

9

forum.

The saving to suitors clause is somewhat

10

different from this provision, but I think what people

11

understood Section 7 as providing is that where the

12

federal remedy does not apply, the state remedies may

13

still be enforced in admiralty.

14

Now, it is true that recently the lower court

15

and a handful of other district courts, out of apparent

16

dissatisfaction of D3HSA*s limitation of recovery to

17

pecuniary damages, have sought to supplement it with

18

remedies borrowed from state law, but in doing so, thei

19

have disregarded this Court's instruction in Mobil Oil

20

v. Higginbotham that, and I quote, "Congress did not

21

limit DOHSA beneficiaries to recovery of

22

losses in order to encourage the creation of

23

nonpecuniary supplements.

24

departure from Higginbotham is not justified by their

25

vague and cryptic language of Section 7."

think it's justified by the legislative history either,

2

either of DOHSA as a whole or Section 7 in particular.

3

The legislative history of DOFSA as a whole,

4

as set forth in the committee reports, reveals that

5

Congress intended to establish a uniform and exclusive

6

remedy for wrongful death on the high seas, and the

7

bill's sponsor. Representative Montague, explained

8

during floor debate, Section 7 was merely put in out of

9

abundant caution to calm the minds of those who think

10

that rights within the territorial waters will be

11

usurped by the national law.

12

Now, to be sure, this statement was mala

13

before Section 7 was amended on the floor of the House,

14

but that amendment, Representatve Mann's amendment,

15

would not havo the effect of defeating the original and

16

expressly staged legislative purposes of uniformity and

exclusivity.

could recognize a general maritime remedy for wrongful

QUESTIONS

So whatever result we reach results

4

reconcile everything whichever way we go. Is there?

5

MR. JONESs

I mean, there is just no way to

That is correct.

That is what

6

this Court recognized in its decision in Higginbotham

7

where it pointed out that the result was one national

8

rule for the territorial waters, and a slightly narrower

9

national rule for the high seas.

10
11
12

13

The Court has

explicitly identified that anomaly in Higginbotham.
Let me address one more point with respect to
the wording of Section 7.
Plaintiffs point out that that wording before

14

its amendment would have prohibited application of state

15

law on ' he high seas by what thay call negative

16

implication.

17

remove a negatively iamplied prohibition from one

18

provision of the bill wit’out substituting in its place

19

a positive directive to enforce state law.

20

Consequently, even if the amendment could be portrayed

21

as a retreat from an original intention of actually

22

requiring federal exclusivity on the high seas, it was

23

at most only a partial and tactical retreat tc a posture

24

of congressional neutrality.

25

amendment means anything at all with respect to the role

If so, the amendment did nothing more than

If adoption of the

1

of state law on the high seas, it means no more than

2

that Congress, having been advised that the courts would

3

hold the federal remedy to be exclusive, whether or not

4

Section 7 was amended, decided simply to leave the

5

matter to the courts without itself either prohibiting

6

or requiring enforcement of state law.

7

Now, as I said earlier, if the matter is left

8

to the courts,

9

d ecide.

10

it is clear what the courts would

The extension of a hodgepodge of differing and

11

conflicting state laws under the high seas would make a

12

mockery of the notion of maritime uniformity.

I want to launch right into this language of

Section 7 which, if you see where the legislators were

coming from, is the farthest thing from neutral.

10

When this bill had been introduced before on

11

numerous occasions, it contained language to the effect

12

that in all cases of death on the high seas, admiralty

courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction, and this shall

be the exclusive remedy.

They were up for years.

4

this, and The Harrisburg was the law from 1P74 until you

5

decided the Soragne case, and everybody thought that The

6

Harrisburg precluded a federal death action in

7

admiralty, and you did not let that erroneous view

8

preclude you from reaching a just decision in the

9

Moragne case.

I think that's a little shallow to approach

And I would not hold to the view that old

Nor would I hold to the view that

12

error is somehow sanctified by the universality of its

acceptance, and I think this is a good opportunity for

14

the Court to straighten out the error that has persisted

15

if such it is.
However, the error has not been universal

16
17

because we cited the Safir case and a number cf other

18

cases from

view, Rairlgh v. Erlbeck, etc., which hold the opposite

view, and that is that Section 7 does indeed say the

see no conceptual reason why the application of state

How, at sea has a very broad reach, and I am

only — I don't, I don't have any reservations about the

applicability of state law in the waters overlying the

divided into two parts,

16

the state law in question was valid.

on to consider the question whether that law would be

considerations that he discusses in that connection was

that this was a case brought in admiralty to limit

liability.

And that is what the ccngression — the

Moreover, the first *art of The Hamilton may

well not have survived the decisions in Jensen and

Chelentis that followed it by about ten years.

those decisions, the Supreme Court confronted once again

the question of whether a state wrongful death statute

8

wuld be applied, this time in territorial waters.

9

is the Garcia case.

After

This

And in that case, the Court said

10

that because in territorial waters the event was

11

maritime and local in character, state law could apply.

12

If The Hamilton had decided more generally that state

13

wrongful death statutes applied on the high seas, there

14

would have been no need for the maritime but local in

15

character ruling of Garcia.

16

Moreover, DOHSA was enacted in the context of

17

Jenson and Chelentis, and in that context, the members

18

of the House recognized that the Supreme Court at that

19

time would hold the federal rule to be exclusive no
