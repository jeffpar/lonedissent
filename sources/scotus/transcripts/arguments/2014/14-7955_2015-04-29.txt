ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBIN C. KONRAD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MS. KONRAD:

please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

Oklahoma chooses to execute our clients with

11

a three­drug formula that includes a paralytic and

12

potassium chloride, drugs that cause intense pain and

13

suffering.

14

constitutional only if a prisoner will not feel the pain

15

and be aware of the suffocation caused by those drugs.

16

The district court erred as a matter of law

17

and as a matter of fact when it found that midazolam as

18

the first drug is constitutionally tolerable.

19

The second and third drugs are

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why is that a matter of

20

law?

21

question, and ­­ and the district court found that it ­­

22

it did eliminate the pain.

23

that the district court was clearly erroneous in that

24

determination?

25

I mean, as I see it, it's just ­­ just a fact

And you're asking us to find

Do we usually do that kind of thing?

MS. KONRAD:

Justice Scalia, the ­­ there's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

a question of law and there's a question of fact.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MS. KONRAD:

What's the question of law?
The question of law includes

4

the ­­ the fact that the district court found that this

5

three­drug formula was constitutionally tolerable in

6

spite of two facts, the first one being that there is a

7

medical consensus that this drug cannot be used as the

8

sole drug ­­

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

That's a question of fact.

11

MS. KONRAD:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a question of fact.

That ­­
You're saying the question

13

of law is that the ­­ the district court ignored two

14

facts.

15

of law; it's still a question of fact.

16

Ignoring two facts does not make it a question

MS. KONRAD:

The ­­ if ­­ if I can, Justice

17

Scalia, the second point is the question of law also

18

involves that the district court found that this drug

19

creates a greater risk of harm than sodium thiopental,

20

but that it could not quantify.

21

drug that creates a greater risk of harm that it could

22

not quantify and it also had before it evidence that

23

this drug is not used for the purpose that ­­ which the

24

State intends it to be used.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it found that this

Could you ­­ the way

Alderson Reporting Company

1

I've thought of this ­­ and I know that in your brief

2

you think de novo review goes to everything.

3

disagree with you, if I think that I have to give

4

deference to the district court's factual finding on how

5

this drug works, the ­­ how do you call it ­­ the ­­

6

MS. KONRAD:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If I

The midazolam.
Midazolam, but that it's

8

a legal question of whether how that drug works creates

9

a risk of harm that's constitutionally intolerable.

10

Is

that how you divide up the legal end?

11

MS. KONRAD:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor, and ­­
So the facts are now.

13

Now let's go to my real question, okay?

14

ignores evidence is not necessarily an abuse of

15

discretion or a clear error.

16

clear errors in terms of the reasoning that the district

17

court used?

18

MS. KONRAD:

That a judge

But ­­ so what are the

So the clear errors in this

19

case, we have to look at what this case is about.

20

this case is about known information and undisputed

21

facts that were before the court.

22

is in a different class than barbiturates, this drug is

23

not known, it's not a pain reliever.

24

recognized these two facts at 76 of the Joint Appendix.

25

This drug, midazolam,

The district court

It's known that this drug has a ceiling

And

effect, so there's a certain point at which giving more

2

of the drug is not going to matter.

3

recognized that at 78.

4

that.

5

The district court

The State's expert recognized

The Petitioners' experts recognized that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but what the

6

district court determined is that it was ­­ was not able

7

to tell precisely when the ceiling effect kicked in,

8

precisely when they hit the ceiling, right?

9
10

MS. KONRAD:

That is ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that ­­ that is

11

your theory for when pain is possible, when it hits the

12

ceiling, right?

13

MS. KONRAD:

What the district court found,

14

Mr. Chief Justice, is whatever the ceiling effect may

15

be, it takes effect only at the spinal cord and that 500

16

milligrams of midazolam will, quote, "create a

17

phenomenon which is not anesthesia," but effectively

18

paralyzes the brain and eliminates awareness of pain.

19

Now, that finding, we have to ­­ we have to

20

look at what undisputed facts were before the court in

21

making that finding to ­­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, is it

23

undisputed facts?

24

showing that the determinations were clearly erroneous.

25

So it's certainly not a case where the facts have to be

I thought you had the burden of

Alderson Reporting Company

2

undisputed.
MS. KONRAD:

And I'm sorry if I misspoke,

3

Mr. Chief Justice.

4

order to show why this was a clearly erroneous finding

5

is what the undisputed facts were before the district

6

court in order for it to reach that conclusion.

7

What we have to look at before in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you even have to go

8

that far?

9

their doctor was right on this point.

The State here doesn't even propose that

10

MS. KONRAD:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They're not defending

12

it, they don't say it's true.

They ­­ I ­­ conceded,

13

as I read their brief, that it does not work the way

14

the doctor said it worked, that it does not paralyze

15

the brain, correct?

16
17

Well, that ­­

MS. KONRAD:

That is correct, Justice

Sotomayor.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

Now we've got an admission that the expert

So it's clear error.

20

was plainly wrong.

21

there was nothing else that the district court could

22

have based its conclusion on, correct?

23

MS. KONRAD:

So how ­­ what else, I guess ­­

That is correct.

And ­­ and

24

the ­­ the district court reached this decision based

25

on no scientific evidence and with a medical consensus

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

to the contrary that this drug is not able to

2

pharmacologically do what the States' expert said that

3

it could in fact do.

4

combined ­­ and as the district court said at Joint

5

Appendix 47, that this is partially a mixed question of

6

fact and mixed question of law.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that clear error is

Ms. Konrad, can I make sure

8

I understand this because, you know, I read that ­­ the

9

part of the opinion that you're referring to and I just

10

really couldn't figure it out.

11

So is it that the court said, well, we don't

12

know what the ceiling effect is generally, but the

13

ceiling effect only goes to how something operates at

14

the spinal cord level, it doesn't go to how it operates

15

at the brain and this ­­ and ­­ this ­­ this takes ­­

16

what we ­­ what we care about is how it operates at the

17

brain, so we don't even have to worry about ceiling

18

effect; is that right?

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MS. KONRAD:

Justice Kagan, that is what the

district court found based on the testimony of the

25

State's experts that's not supported by any scientific

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

literature, any ­­ any medical information and, in fact,

2

is inconsistent with the State's expert's own testimony.

3

Because he testified and explained that the way this

4

drug works is it works throughout the central nervous

5

system.

He said ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you're saying we do have

to worry about the ceiling effect.

9

drug at the brain, and the ­­ it's actually crucial what

There isn't this

contradiction to what the court said, which was we

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MS. KONRAD:

Is that ­­

That ­­
Is that how it goes?
Yes, Justice Kagan.

And

this ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Did you introduce any

18

evidence to show the dosage at which the ceiling effect

19

would occur?

20

MS. KONRAD:

We had testimony from our

21

expert who ­­ who indicated that it could be calculated,

22

but it was not calculated.

23

doesn't matter because what matters is that we know that

24

the drug has a ceiling effect, and that is what matters.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

But, Justice Alito, that

Well, what if the ceiling

Now, there's been some defense that the 750 wasn't

20

immediately delivered, but it was still 750 that went

21

into his system and caused that kind of pain, correct?

22

MS. KONRAD:

Yes.

MS. KONRAD:

No, we're actually talking of

several executions that ­­ the execution in this case,

10

in Oklahoma, that happened a year ago of Mr. Lockett

What we know about this drug,

Justice Scalia, is that it can never maintain the deep

coma­like unconsciousness that is necessary to prevent

18

a prisoner from feeling the painful effects of the ­­

19

I'm sorry, of the potassium chloride.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How do we know that?

I

21

thought that what we knew was something different.

22

thought that what we knew was just what we can't know;

23

in other words, that there's this huge range of

24

uncertainty about what happens when somebody is ­­ is

25

given this drug.

Alderson Reporting Company

I

13

You're suggesting something more than that,

2

which is that we know what happens, we know that the

3

drug can't maintain deep ­­ deep unconsciousness.

4

Which ­­ which is right?

5

MS. KONRAD:

Justice Kagan, we know because

6

of the pharmacological properties of this drug, the way

7

that ­­ that when the drug was being tested and being

8

introduced, it is not used for the sole purpose of

9

preventing somebody from feeling pain during a painful

10
11

procedure.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I thought it wasn't

12

used for that purpose just because we don't know whether

13

it's capable of being used for that purpose, as opposed

14

to we know it's incapable of being used for that

15

purpose, if you see the difference.

16

MS. KONRAD:

I do see the difference, but I

17

think what's important here is this Court in Baze

18

explained that it's important to reemphasize that a

19

proper dose of sodium thiopental obviates the concern

20

that the prisoner will not be sufficiently sedated.

the judiciary to countenance what amounts to a guerilla

22

war against the death penalty which consists of efforts

23

to make it impossible for the States to obtain drugs

24

that could be used to carry out capital punishment with

25

little, if any, pain?

And so the States are reduced to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15

using drugs like this one which give rise to disputes

2

about whether, in fact, every possibility of pain is

3

eliminated.

4

Now, what is your response to that?

5

MS. KONRAD:

Well, Justice Alito, the

6

purpose of the courts is to decide whether a method of

7

execution or the way that the State is going to carry

8

out an execution is, in fact, constitutional, and it ­­

9

whether we're going to tolerate ­­ is it objectively

10

intolerable to allow the States to carry out a method in

11

this way.

12

And so ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I guess ­­ I guess I

13

would be more inclined to find that it was intolerable

14

if there was even some doubt about this drug when there

15

was a perfectly safe other drug available.

16

States have gone through two different drugs, and those

17

drugs have been rendered unavailable by the abolitionist

18

movement putting pressure on the companies that

19

manufacture them so that the States cannot obtain those

20

two other drugs.

21

But the

And now you want to come before the Court

22

and say, well, this third drug is not 100 percent sure.

23

The reason it isn't 100 percent sure is because the

24

abolitionists have rendered it impossible to get the

25

100 percent sure drugs, and you think we should not view

MS. KONRAD:

cause what they say is a ­­ put the prisoner in a ­­ in

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now ­­

Mr. Wyrick, as ­­ as I

15

understand it, there were three subsidiary findings that

16

underlay this conclusion.

17

The first is the one that we talked a little

18

bit about with Ms. Konrad, which has to do with the

19

ceiling effect, which, as I understand it you, don't at

20

all defend.

21

The second is the idea that 500 milligrams

22

of this drug would likely kill a patient in 30 minutes

23

or an hour, which seems to me irrelevant given that a

24

lethal dose is completely consistent with unbearable

25

pain.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

And the third is that that dose of midazolam

2

would keep a patient unconscious while a needle is

3

inserted into his thigh, which also seems irrelevant

4

given the ­­ what everybody understands to be the much,

5

much, much greater potential for pain of potassium

6

chloride.

7

So those were the three subsidiary findings.

8

One of them nobody thinks is anything other than

gobbledygook, and the other two are irrelevant.

Now, after the fact, when we were at the

Now, their other expert, he cited the Saari

article for the proposition that there is a ceiling

effect.

6

says, well, there may be a ceiling effect.

7

goes on to say that, in fact, this drug has been used

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBIN C. KONRAD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. KONRAD:

Justice Kagan, I wanted to

address your hypothetical.

22

23

correct, manifests itself, then there will be

24

unconstitutional pain and suffering.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess the question I was

4

asking was if a person was burned alive and we didn't

5

know whether he had appropriate anesthesia, would that

6

be unconstitutional, too?

7

MS. KONRAD:

That would be, Justice Kagan,

8

and that's ­­ the point here is that the district court

9

below found that there is a greater risk in using

10

midazolam, but found it was unquantifiable.

11

that risk, in fact, manifests itself, there will be a

12

constitutionally intolerable execution.
