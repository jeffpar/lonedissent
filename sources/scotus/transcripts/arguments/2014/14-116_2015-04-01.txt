ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

A denial of a confirmation of a bankruptcy

11

plan is appealable as of right under 28 U.S.C. Section

12

158, the bankruptcy­specific provision that deals with

13

appeals in bankruptcy cases as opposed to other civil

14

cases.

15

That is because the denial of confirmation

16

finally determines the debtor's right to the disposition

17

of property and future income that's provided for in the

18

plan that was denied.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How often, when you

20

have a plan denied, is there typically ­­

21

22

part of it, you address it and fix it.

23

you ­­ you try again, or maybe a third time, until you

24

get it.

25

Okay, now it's perfect.

MR. FELDMAN:

In other words,

Let's go ahead.

appeal from the first denial?

confirm the plan, and you wait until it's all done, and

The point in

is you look at it proceeding by proceeding.

question is when the proceeding ended ­­ ends.

at all, really, is to allow the debtor ­­

11

MR. FELDMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Okay?

And then ­­ and then

13

the debtor says, I don't want to amend it that way.

14

Okay?

15

happens?

16

I'm not doing it.

MR. FELDMAN:

No amendment filed.

Then I think that the court

probably dismiss the case.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

Then what

Fine, and then the debtor

has an appeal.

20

MR. FELDMAN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.
So what's the problem?
So here's the problem:

If you

23

require the debtor ­­ so the debtor here has been denied

24

the right to the hybrid treatment of his mortgage that

25

he wanted in a plan.

If you require the debtor to go to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

a dismissal on the entire bankruptcy case in order to

2

appeal that, the debtor and other creditors lose the

3

right to the automatic stay.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, is that a good idea?

5

What we do is we do there the same as any other case.

6

We say I appreciate your staying this so I don't lose

7

the advantage while I have an opportunity to appeal.

8

And if the bankruptcy judge doesn't do it, you ask the

9

appellate panel to do it.

That comes every day in the

10

week, it comes up in criminal cases, civil cases all the

11

time.

12

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, but at that point ­­ at

13

that point the debtor's burden in showing that they're

14

entitled to a stay, courts have viewed that as a

15

similar ­­

Then he'll get it.

But ­­ well ­­

sometimes, by the way.

2

appeals ­­ potentially anyway, none of us knows ­­ in

3

dozens of cases, and then you say contested matters,

4

there are all kinds of contested matters so we'll have

5

to invent a new set of distinctions about which

6

contested matters do count as final and which ones

7

don't.

8

baby out with the bath water.

9

That seems to me to be throwing a very giant

MR. FELDMAN:

Your Honor, we're not arguing

10

that all contested matters should be appealable.

That's right.
So you're defining the

contest as yes or no to this plan.
MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

And the very same

9

issue would be at issue if, had the court confirmed it,

10

as it would be at issue in this appeal of the denial ­­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't see that.

Because

12

I thought when a court confirms a plan then there is

13

nothing left to do but execute the plan.

14

what you have to do is give an appeal, or the plan will

15

be executed, the wages will be garnished, you'll be

16

paying forever.

17

more will happen and, therefore, there is appeal.

So obviously

Actually ­­
I didn't see why you give

23

an additional set of appeals when only an amendment is

at stake.

MR. FELDMAN:

But ­­ I guess, let me address

Now the fact that the court granted leave to

amend is really equivalent in the norm or similar in a

plan.

MR. FELDMAN:

So nothing is

That ­­ it's actually ­­

that's only kind of true.

In a Chapter 13 case, the

Alderson Reporting Company

20
1

debtor has to start making payments as soon as the plan

2

is proposed, which is in about 30 days or so of the time

3

the petition is filed.

4

usually for three to five years.

And the debtor makes payments

5

So I would say in virtually every case and

6

probably every case while the appeal is going on, the

7

debtor is still making the payments under the plan.

8

The ­­ it is true the money isn't disbursed to the

9

creditor until after there is an ultimate confirmation,

10

but meanwhile, the ­­ as I think you just heard in the

11

other case, the trustee is supposed to invest the money

12

in an interest­bearing account.

Those proceeds will

13

eventually go to the creditors.

So things are ­­ in a

14

Chapter 13 case ­­ are going on in the course of the

15

appeal.

MR. FELDMAN:

And those cases which involve

2

issues that are really of importance, are of importance

3

to the debtor, and perhaps importance to the whole

4

bankruptcy system, are the ones that are going to be

5

appealed and that won't ever be appealed if you don't

6

allow an appeal at this stage.

7

And I think as shown by the presence of the

8

United States and Bank of America, both of which, I

9

think, are probably among the largest creditors in the

10

country and probably participate as creditors in more

11

bankruptcy cases than anyone else, on our side of the

case, this ­­ allowing an appeal at this stage is ­­ is

13

important for the sake of sound functionality of the

bankruptcy system for allowing bankruptcy ­­ appellate

15

courts to develop and harmonize the law in bankruptcy,

16

17

And it won't do any undue harm to creditors

because the ­­ especially in a Chapter 13 case, the

creditor is ­­ the debtor is continuing to pay, and in

If the

10

discrete dispute is consideration of the plan that is

going to be part of the bankruptcy, then what you just

said is wrong.

13

MR. TRIPP:

Right.

And I think that's

14

absolutely the nub of the case is trying to determine

15

whether this is a discrete dispute, and ­­ and so it's

16

not about whether it's ­­ it's substantive rights or

procedural.

18

It's really ­­ it's whether it's discrete.

And I think the path we suggest in our brief

19

which is drawn from the Collier treatise is really by

20

far the clearest way of getting at this.

21

is ­­ is first, you just recognize that a bankruptcy

22

case is ­­ consists of adversary proceedings in

contested matters, and then you just apply ordinary

24

principles of finality to those contested matters.

talk about the formality, the bankruptcy judge who

doesn't want to be appealed, and I assume most of them

17

probably deny this unless you come back with something

18

and tell me that ­­ why this creditor shouldn't get, you

know, 200 dollars as opposed to 10 dollars.

10

suggesting that it is supposed to be, in ­­ in many

12

opportunity for debtors to take an immediate appeal for

I want it the other way around.

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Well,

Your Honor, I

6

agree, the ­­ the Petitioner answered the question

7

earlier suggesting that only the debtor could appeal.

8

If the determination of this Court is that the order

9

denying confirmation with leave to appeal is a final

10

order, it would follow, I would think, that there is res

11

judicata effect of that order just as Espinosa held, and

12

that not only could a creditor appeal, the creditor must

13

appeal in order to preserve their rights.

14

And when one thinks about this in the ­­ how

15

it would apply in the Chapter 11 context, when you don't

16

simply have one plan, at least after the period of

17

exclusivity has expired, but rather multiple plans, the

theirs, it raises very serious questions of what the

the other alternatives work.

confirmed plan said.

13

On the other hand, as far as trying to

confirm a later plan, what this forces the debtor into

is a situation where a debtor may have to try to figure

out and propose a plan that the debtor might even prefer

not to be in bankruptcy at all rather than to live under

that plan.

19

the review of the earlier denial of confirmation is to

propose some plan that maybe disposes of property in a

way that the debtor completely doesn't want and would

rather have just given up on the whole thing.
