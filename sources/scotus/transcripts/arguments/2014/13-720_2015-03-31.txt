ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MELNIK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. MELNIK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

Brulotte's per se ban on patent royalties on

12

post­expiration use should be discarded because it is a

13

rule without a reason.

14

an outdated and misguided decision that prohibits

15

royalty arrangements that are frequently socially

16

beneficial.

17

Brulotte is widely recognized as

Brulotte suppresses innovation and

18

interferes with the goals of the patent system,

19

increasing the likelihood that potentially breakthrough

20

discoveries by universities and research hospitals such

21

as the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center will never reach

22

patients and consumers.

I ­­ I mean, it's not

examples of ­­ of this.

4

MR. MELNIK:

I don't see any

Well, the ­­ the examples that

5

we have are the amicus briefs.

6

entities that are ­­ that do this licensing on a

7

day­to­day basis are telling the Court in their amicus

briefs that the ­­ the Brulotte rule is having this

9

suppressed effect; in other words, that certain

In other words, the

licensing arrangements that would otherwise ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

so, given what you say?

14

"license payment terms, consequently, reflect the

15

anticipated value of the authorization to use the

Why ­­ why should that be
In ­­ in your brief you say,

17

All you have to do is make it clear that,

18

although the payments continue after expiration, they

19

are for the pre­expiration period.

20

So it's ­­ it's ­­ I don't understand why

21

this should be so troublesome if the contract says these

22

payments will be spread out over whatever period of

23

time, but they are for the patent during the period when

24

it was valid.

25

they're nominally measured by post­expiration use, they

If you say the next sentence is “even if

nonetheless represent an amortization of the predicted

2

value of the pre­expiration authorization."

3

that in the contract, then I don't see where there's a

4

problem.

5

MR. MELNIK:

If you say

The distinction, Justice

6

Ginsburg, is between what you're paying for and how

7

you're paying for it.

8

is an estimate of the value of the use of the patent

9

during the patent term.

10

The what that you're paying for

What Brulotte currently permits is one

11

method of how to pay for it, which is to defer payment

12

into the post­expiration period.

13

currently permit is to defer ­­ is to stretch the

14

royalty base, to defer accrual into the post­expiration

15

period.

16

something that deferred payment does not, which is to

17

shift the risk of commercialization failure and

18

innovation failure from the licensee to the licensor.

And deferred accrual allows parties to do

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

around that as well?

21

into a joint venture?

22

What Brulotte doesn't

MR. MELNIK:

Aren't there ways to get
I mean, why don't you just enter

So, Justice Kagan, I guess my

23

first answer to that is that's not the right question.

24

The right question is, if you're prohibiting something

25

that doesn't make sense, the initial question should be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1
2

why are you prohibiting it?
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But ­­
Well, possibly, except that

3

we have statutory stare decisis, and to the extent that

4

we think something is not really causing a problem in

5

the real world, why overrule something against that

6

basic backdrop principle?

7

MR. MELNIK:

So the ­­ the next answer to

8

your question, then, is that the ­­ the alternative

9

arrangements are not risk redistributive in the same way

10

that royalty ­­ that the deferral of accrual is

11

risk­free distributive.

12

stretch the royalty base into the post­expiration period

13

in situations where you're ­­ where early stage

14

technology is involved where there may not be any sales

15

until fairly late and stretching into the

16

post­expiration period, you allow the licensee to say,

17

I'm going to take on this risk but in exchange,

18

licensor, you're going to bear the risk that if the

19

product fails, I won't have to pay much because if there

20

aren't any sales, I don't have to pay you.

What do I mean by that?

If you

21

Payment postponement, for example, doesn't

22

allow the parties to do that because even if you

23

postpone the payment, you still owe.

24

pay has accrued during the term, and even if you have to

25

pay later, you still have to pay.

Alderson Reporting Company

The obligation to

That's the

fundamental difference between payment postponement,

2

which is not risk redistributive and ­­ which is

3

permitted by Brulotte.

4

which ­­

5

And accrual postponement

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, but I was suggesting

6

that either could be accomplished, both could be

7

accomplished through other means, and particularly

8

through just entering into a joint venture rather than

9

having a license arrangement.

10

MR. MELNIK:

So those kinds of arrangements

11

may not be realistic for the kinds of entities that are

12

most directly impacted by the Brulotte prohibition;

13

universities, research hospitals particular ­­

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is that what it is?

Because

15

when I was looking at the amicus briefs here, I was

16

struck by the fact that there really are ­­ are not

17

companies on the amicus brief.

18

entities.

19

because nonprofit entities have this particular problem,

20

that they can't make the arrangements that would

21

otherwise get around the Brulotte rule?

22

There are not for­profit

It's all nonprofit entities.

MR. MELNIK:

And is that

Well, it's not all nonprofits.

23

We had ­­ we had an amicus brief from Biotime which was

24

a ­­ a private company's.

25

groups of entities that are most directly impacted are

But one of the ­­ one of the

Alderson Reporting Company

universities, research hospitals, and the like because

2

they're the ones where the ­­ the ­­ not all license ­­

3

licensing situations are going to be a good fit for ­­

4

for accrual deferral.

5

arrangement may not make sense for the parties, and they

6

wouldn't enter into it.

In many situations, this kind of

where the parties may desire to defer accrual but are

prohibited by Brulotte from doing so are very early

14

affected by the ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, yes, those are entities ­­

21

of this rule and has left it alone.

23

given.

24
25

But these parties have recently been to

MR. MELNIK:

And you're asking

Well, Justice Kennedy, I would

say that not so recently ­­ and I think that we have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

demonstrated special justification within the meaning of

2

this Court's case law for overruling this kind of

3

precedent, and I would say that we have demonstrated it

4

in four ways.

5

First, we have shown that since the Court

6

considered Brulotte, the patent equals market power

7

presumption has fallen, and it ­­ and it has fallen

8

actually since the time ­­ last time that Congress

9

looked at this in 1988.

10

There has been a foundational shift ­­

11

second, there has been a foundational shift in

12

competition law away from per se rules and toward

13

contextualized rules such as the rule of reason.

14

Third, economists and other experts in the

15

licensing and ­­ and patent field have reached a much

16

more nuanced understanding of the economics of

17

post­expiration royalties, an understanding that didn't

18

exist at the time this Court has found ­­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that ­­ you ­­ those are

20

the three points, and I just wonder, imagine I have a

21

piece of intellectual property which I have patented and

22

now I have 55 potential licensees.

23

them, I will license to you and you will pay me next to

24

nothing for any use up to 20 years while you're figuring

25

out how to use it.

And I say to each of

But if it turns out you use it, in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

years 20 to 30, you pay me a lot for each use.

2

That's the problem, isn't it?

3

MR. MELNIK:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay?

Yes.
Now I've done it for 55,

5

and there are a lot of good reasons for getting them to

6

do that.

7

you reconcile that with the Constitution's requirement

8

that patents are for limited terms, and statute which

9

says the limited term is 20 years.

I understand the reasons.

I just wonder how

Because if that

10

means something, I suppose it means that after that

11

statutory period of 20 limited years, people can use

12

that intellectual property for free.

13

Now ­­ now, if it doesn't mean that, what

14

does it mean?

15

my example allow people to use it for free?

16

mean, they couldn't use it for free.

17

And if it does mean that, I mean, how did

MR. MELNIK:

Not ­­ I

They had to pay.

The way that I would reconcile

18

it, Justice Breyer, is ­­ is to decouple the notion of

19

the right to exclude, which is what the statutory term

20

is about, the right to prevent the public as a whole

21

from using the patented invention from the specific

22

royalty arrangement.

23

Chief Justice Posner put it in Scheiber, once the patent

24

expires expiration is accomplished what it was supposed

25

to ­­

Once, as ­­ as Chief Justice ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is.

And everybody who

2

might use this, by the way, any conceivable person,

3

there were only 53 people who might ever use it, and I

4

got 55 to sign up.

And therefore, nobody's going to use

5

it without paying.

I'm just saying how, in my example,

6

do we reconcile that with the constitutional and

7

statutory mandate that after 20 years it's free?

8

MR. MELNIK:

9

First is we have to remember that what we're

So, let me make two points.

10

dealing with here is a per se rule.

11

prohibits all hypotheticals, not just one hypothetical.

12

We're not advocating per se legality.

13
14
15
16

JUSTICE BREYER:

A per se rule

In my case, it would be

unlawful.
MR. MELNIK:

I'm ­­ I'm not saying that.

I

was ­­ I was getting to the second point.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. MELNIK:

What's the second point?
The second point is that ­­ is

19

that in the ­­ in the post­expiration period, even in

20

your situation, what we're really dealing with are the

21

prices and outputs at which the public is going to

22

access the invention.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I'll tell you, in my

24

example, the price and output is a big payment to the

25

owner of the patent in year 29.

That's the price and

Alderson Reporting Company

output.

2

is up.

3

And the output is restricted because the price

So by ­­ during the term, the

4

license ­­ the ­­ the licensees got to use the

5

invention.

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

lot of good reasons for it.

8

you reconcile the fact that everybody is paying a lot of

9

money to use this intellectual property in year 29 with

My simple question was how

10

what seems a statute and a Constitution that say it

should be free at that time.

don't want to ask it again because I don't like to ask a

13

question more than four times.

14

MR. MELNIK:
been clear in my answer.

16

this.

Let me take another shot at

The ­­ the answer to your question is that

18

one needs to ­­ in our view, is that one needs to

19

de­couple the right ­­ the right to exclude, which is

20

what the term is about, from the royalty arrangement.

21

Understand ­­

22

I

I ­­ I apologize if I have not

15

17

That's what I'm asking.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If by that ­­ if by

23

that you mean that there will be a lot of new people

24

coming in who ­­ because they don't have to pay the

25

license fee in year 29, and it's very easy for them to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

figure out what to do because they can copy the patent

2

and anybody can come and see, I can make one of these.

3

All the competition ­­ in fact, everybody who was in the

4

business is paying an extra ­­ has to charge an extra $2

5

because of this license fee, I won't have to charge an

6

extra $2.

7

money.

8
9
10
11

I'll go into that business and make a lot of

MR. MELNIK:
Chief Justice.

That's certainly correct, Mr.

And that's a point that we made in the

brief.
JUSTICE BREYER:

It's correct only if,

12

unfortunately, to get into this business because the

13

patent happens to be ­­ to do with a gizmo, and the

14

gizmo is 14 feet deep buried inside a computer and the

15

computer is 19,000 meters tall, and so there are only 55

16

people, conceivably, who could get into this business,

17

and they are all licensed.

18

MR. MELNIK:

So if the question is can

19

one ­­ can one come up with a hypothetical where the

20

arrangement would be impermissible because it would

21

violate the rule of reason, the answer is yes.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But why are we

23

importing ­­ it's a fair question by the Respondents and

5

fault us for doing that in our original decision, but

Because you ­­ you named

So the fourth point was that we have a

8

better understanding of the real world impact, of the

9

innovation suppressing effect of these kinds of royalty

10

arrangements that we're hearing from the amicus briefs.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that surely is a

12

question for Congress, to go back to what Justice

13

Sotomayor was saying, you know, to the extent that

14

there's a real world problem, and maybe there is and

15

maybe there's not, it's a little bit hard to tell from

So the same thing could have

nevertheless, overruled that that equals market power

exact same­­ one of the same bills that was ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

And this Court,

Official

18

We have the same here.

We have near

2

unanimous consensus in the expert literature that all of

3

these new understandings have emerged since Brulotte has

4

been decided that undermine every single premise on

5

which Brulotte was based.

6

And the same was true in Blonder­Tongue,

7

which was the subject of the discussion in the first

8

case this morning where this Court overruled prior

9

decisions in ­­ and changed a judge­made rule in the

10

11

filed an amicus brief that said the fact that Congress

issue is, quote­unquote, "of no significance."

And the government in that case

arguing is a sort of new rationale for when to depart

when a prior decision is based on what we now view to be

2

again, both of those things seem to me to be

3

congressional choices, much more than judicial choices,

that it's Congress that's better positioned to assess

the real­world impact, and it's Congress that's better

JUSTICE BREYER:

Economics certainly plays

an important role in antitrust.

16

that economists frequently don't take account of is the

17

administrative cost of administering by judges a complex

19

how complex that would be.

20

of a simple rule are obvious.

5

to me that putting stare decisis to the side, it would

be wise, since none of the economists, even including

remember that the rule ­­ the question is not whether

the rule of reason should apply to patent misuse.

these particular types of royalty arrangements should be

remember that these are negotiated transactions, that

for them.

the licensor, because the licensee will at some point,

MR. SAUNDERS:

I ­­ I think that this Court

13

has recognized that in the antitrust context, where you

14

have such a barebones statute and a long history of very

15

minimal congressional action in that area, this Court

16

has had a greater willingness to overturn its precedent.

17

In the Patent Act, this is an area where Congress has

18

revisited it frequently, 33 times since 1952; important

19

to this case, has revisited the patent term, changed the

20

patent term, added patent term extensions, patent term

21

adjustments, carefully calibrating the incentives to

22

strike what it considers to be the correct balance with

Congress has set a limited window of opportunity in

frankly, not just the value of your own invention, but a

certain amount of follow­on invention that may build on

and incorporate your invention, and that is set within

that particular window.

And once you begin going beyond that, by

contract, there's increased risk that what's going to

cause sales to spike in the 30th year is not your own

original innovation, but the follow­on innovation, the

innovation of your licensee.

speculative and uncertain harm, given the flexibility

7

that's already allowed to amortize payments under

8

Brulotte; and, on the other hand, the certainty and

9

expense of a very difficult to apply legal regime.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you ­­ but

amortizing the payments under Brulotte is very

12

restrictive.

13

be related in some sense to the patent period, you

14

cannot take into account events after that.

15

would think one of the risks are, well, maybe we'll be

16

able to turn this invention into something or maybe we

17

won't, and so we have to give, you know, license fees

18

that take that contingency into account.

19

do that under Brulotte, because that can only refer to

20

the period that's left on the patent.

21

What you're saying, those payments have to

Right.

And yet I

But you can't

have ­­ you have 20 years in which you can do absolutely

23

anything, can account for all ­­ all of your risks in

24

that period in terms of whether the product is taken

25

off.

And what you can't do under Brulotte is say, if

2

20­year period, then we're going to be capturing that.

3

But I think that ­­ that crystallizes the problem, the

4

conflict between Petitioner's position and the patent

5

policy here, because what you're saying really saying

6

is, my invention is such that 20 years isn't long enough

7

for me, it's not going to realize a success until after

8

the 20­year period.

9

The fact that you may not be able to capture

10

that is a direct consequence of the decision Congress

11

made when it set the patent term.

12

concerns that are raised by particular industries,

concerns, given the complexity of the economics here,

given the disputes that we're having about the reliance

24

to weigh at this point, particularly since we're talking

25

about a rule that has stood for 50 years, and during

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM STEWART

6
7
8
9
10

Thank you, counsel.

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court's decision in Brulotte is not an

11

outlier, but instead fits comfortably within a

12

substantial body of decisions that recognize a strong

13

Patent Act policy favoring unrestricted public access to

14

unpatented and previously patented inventions, and these

15

cases fall into two basic categories.

16

The ­­ the first is cases like Bonito Boats,

17

Compco, Sears Roebuck, where the Court held to be

18

preempted State laws that would provide patent­like

19

protection to inventions that either were not patentable

20

under Federal law or inventions as to which a Federal

21

patent had expired.

22

that were held to be preempted took the form of

23

prohibitions on the copying of products that were

24

already in ­­ in the market.

25

those decisions didn't apply anything that looked like

And typically, those State laws

And ­­ and the Court in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

rule of reason analysis.

2

economic analysis at all.

3

It really didn't apply

It didn't purport to say that the economy

4

would be worse off if these laws were allowed to be

5

enforced.

6

with the balance that Congress has struck, both between

7

what is patentable and what is unpatentable, and the

8

balance that Congress has struck as to what the length

9

of patent protection should be.

10

It simply said those laws are inconsistent

And the Court could have drawn a sharp

11

distinction between prescriptive State laws and private

12

contractual arrangements, but it didn't.

13

And I think in addition to Brulotte, the two

14

cases that I would point to that fall into the second

15

category are the cases that Mr. Saunders has mentioned,

16

Scott Paper and Lear.

17

that if even a single licensee was allowed to enter into

18

a binding restriction on his use of the patented

19

invention after the patent expires, the consuming public

20

would be deprived of full unrestricted access to the

21

patented invention.

22

In Scott Paper, the Court said

And ­­ and two points there are crucial.

23

The first is the Court recognized that even though the

24

restriction that was sought to be applied in Sears would

25

bind only a single person, would ­­ wouldn't prevent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

others from using the patented invention after the

2

patent expires.

3

restriction inconsistent with Federal patent policy.

4

And the Court explained that was so in part because when

5

a single licensee is restricted in his ability to use

6

the formerly patented invention, it's not only he who

7

suffers; it's the consuming public who could otherwise

8

hope to buy the products that he manufactures.

Nevertheless, that was regarded as a

9

And ­­ and the second case is Lear, where

10

the Court held after Brulotte that even when the ­­ a

11

licensee has entered into a contractual promise not to

12

challenge the patent and to continue to pay royalties

13

during the pendency of any challenge that may arise, the

14

licensee can repudiate the license, can challenge the

15

patent itself, can cease paying royalties.

16

it take ­­ the licensee, in that circumstance, takes the

17

chance that it may have to pay damages if the patent is

18

held to be valid ­­ if the patent is held to be valid.

19

But if a licensee is correct, if the patent is invalid,

20

its contractual arrangement will not prevent it ­­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Obviously,

Mr. Stewart, do you take

22

issue at all with the economic theory of all of the

23

amici that have filed in the antitrust area saying this

24

makes no sense ­­

25

MR. STEWART:

I ­­ I ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MR. STEWART:

­­ economically?
I'd say three ­­ we ­­ we do

3

take issue to some extent, because at least some of the

4

criticisms are based on the misconception that Brulotte

5

prohibits extending royalty payments out past the date

6

of patent expiration, and Brulotte properly understood,

7

as the Petitioners recognize, prohibits royalties that

8

accrue based on post­expiration use, but it doesn't

9

prohibit the post­expiration payments of royalties that

10

are calculated based on use during the patent.

11

to that extent, we do disagree.

So to ­­

12

We ­­ I think also, a lot of the antitrust

13

criticism has been to the effect that ­­ and ­­ and we

14

agree with this as far as it goes ­­ that viewed as a

15

matter of modern antitrust law, a ­­ a per se rule of

16

illegality would not be warranted because the per se

17

rule is reserved for situations in which rule of reason

18

analysis would always or almost always condemn the

19

practice.

20

And so if a particular practice is

21

procompetitive and even of significant range of cases,

22

it should be analyzed under the rule of reason for

23

antitrust purposes, and ­­ and we don't disagree with

24

the ­­ the critique that Brulotte ­­ the Brulotte rule

25

would not be a sound one of antitrust policy.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

But even to say rule of reason should be

2

applied because this is not always anticompetitive is

3

not going as far as saying that, on balance, the

4

Brulotte rule causes more economic harm than benefit.

5

I ­­ we don't ­­ I don't know to what extent the

6

economists have really made that case.

We don't think

7

it's been proved one way or the other.

It seems to us

8

to be a criticism that ­­ that's much more soundly

9

directed at ­­ at ­­ to ­­ to Congress.

10
11
12

That the other thing that I would say
about ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

What ­­ what

13

benefit do ­­ do you see coming from the rule?

14

if you're just analyzing it, you know, economically as

15

we would do for antitrust analysis ­­

16

MR. STEWART:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18
19

I mean,

The ­­
­­ what ­­ what are the

economic benefits of the rule?
MR. STEWART:

Arrangements like the ones at

20

issue here can cause economic harm in the sense that

21

they prevent the licensee from making unrestricted use

22

of the product after the license expires.

23

may, in certain circumstances, determine that it's ­­

24

it's not feasible to sell the thing at a profit if it

25

has to pay the royalties.

The licensee

At the very least, it will

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

presumably bake the royalties into the price it charges

2

to consumers.

3

Now, there ­­ there is an argument on the

4

other side, this is more than made up for by the fact

5

that the licensee will presumably be charged less while

6

the patent is in force.

7
8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That ­­ they are the harms.

What ­­ what are the benefits?
MR. STEWART:

The benefits in ­­ in terms of

10

economics are that the licensee or after the ­­ the

11

patent expires can make decisions about whether to

12

exploit the invention, what sort of follow­on products

13

to devise that may incorporate the patented invention

14

without any disincentive created by the obligation to

15

pay royalties.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

In a word, you have a

17

higher price after the 20 years is up, and a higher

18

price means a restricted output.

19

MR. STEWART:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. STEWART:

22

But I ­­ I think the other point I would

That's correct.
Any other antitrust ­­
That's correct.

23

make is, and I ­­ I take your point, Mr. Chief Justice,

24

that the 1960s are often associated with loose economic

25

analysis, but I think ­­ I think Brulotte not only was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

not an antitrust decision.

2

worse, the Court really didn't rely on economic analysis

3

of any sort.

4

struck was that during the period when the patent is in

5

force, you can basically charge whatever royalties the

6

market will bear; after the patent expires, the

7

invention is supposed to be available for free,

8

unrestricted use for the public, and you can't trade one

9

for the other.

10

I think, for better or

That is, it said the balance that Congress

It's essentially the same mode of reasoning

11

that the Court used in cases like Bonito Boats and

12

Roebuck.

13

might or might have not have been true, this will cause

14

economic harm to allow States to restrict copying in

15

this manner, the argument was simply this is not the

16

balance that Congress has struck.

17

Sears

The ­­ the analysis was not ­­ although it

And I wanted to return to ­­ to

18

Lear for a second because this was a case in which the

19

Court applied the same basic mode of reasoning to a

20

private contractual arrangement; that is, the Court

21

recognized in Lear that the agreement potentially bound

22

only the licensee; that is, any other member of the

23

public could have challenged the validity of the patent.

24

But as Mr. Saunders said, the Court pointed out that the

25

licensee may often be in the best position both because

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

it has knowledge of the patent's workings and because it

2

has the economic incentive to try to escape the royalty

3

obligation.

4

challenge the validity of the patent, and therefore, a

5

restriction that binds only the licensee is less

6

sweeping than one that binds the ­­ the whole State or

7

the whole country, but it's still not just like a

8

restriction on a randomly selected individual.

9

The licensee may be in the best position to

I guess the ­­ the other thing I would say

10

about the ­­ the Sloan­Kettering brief and the argument

11

that is made there is that undoubtedly, the Brulotte

12

rule sometimes prevents contracting parties from

13

agreeing to the precise mix of burdens and benefits that

14

they would prefer.

15

that the effect of the Brulotte rule is to prevent these

16

agreements from being formed at all as opposed to their

17

being ­­ causing them to be formed on terms that are

18

somewhat suboptimal from the ­­ the standpoint of the

19

contracting parties.

20

say is to the extent that there's a ­­ evidence to show

21

real substantial harm in terms of impairment of

22

licensing agreements, again, that evidence is better

23

considered and evaluated by Congress.

But there's really been no evidence

That ­­ the second thing we would

24

The ­­ the other thing I would say is that

25

the situation in which the Sloan­Kettering brief is ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

is most clearly directed at is one in which it's

2

necessary to do substantial non­remunerative work as a

3

preliminary matter during the period while the patent is

4

in force in order to be able to monetize the invention

5

down the road.

6

during the period while the patent is in force is not a

7

real sound estimate of the value of being able to

8

exploit the patent.

9

in which it's most likely that after patent expiration,

And that's why they say, well, use

But those are precisely the cases

10

competitors will face barriers to entry.

11

that you need to do a lot of preliminary work before you

12

can make money is to say that people who haven't done

13

the preliminary work may face difficulties in ­­ in

14

becoming competitors.

15

situation where the licensees might prefer not to have

16

the Brulotte rule in place, but it's also a situation in

17

which a burden on the licensee is most substantial.

And so on the one hand, that's a
