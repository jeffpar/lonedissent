ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BERRETH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Section 1446(a) Congress established a

12

pleading standard for the notice of removal, not a

13

demand for proof.

14

tells us this.

15

provides that a notice of removal shall contain a short

16

and plain statement of the grounds for removal.

The plain language in Section 1446(a)

The plain language of Section 1446(a)

17

And that mirrors language that has been used

18

in Rule 8 for more than 80 years and that has never been

19

held to require evidence with the complaint.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, how do we know that

21

the reason the court of appeals did ­­ did not ­­ or

22

MR. BERRETH:

Well, we know that the court

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right, and so your ­­

your ­­ your job is to argue that that was an abuse of

5

discretion, because the statute says that they may,

7

They may take it­­

MR. BERRETH:

Well, an abuse of

8

discretion ­­ an abuse of discretion is not necessary to

9

be shown here.

It can be shown here, because what the

10

circuit court did here was let stand a decision that did

11

many things.

12

And it's an unusual situation in the law,

13

Justice Scalia.

14

court that flouted the plain language of the statute.

15

It let stand a decision of the district

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it always an abuse of

16

discretion for the court of appeals to let an erroneous

17

decision stand?

18

MR. BERRETH:

Not necessarily always.

In a

19

case like this, however, when the decision that was

20

let ­­ let to stand flouted the plain language of the

21

statute, is a situation where if it's not corrected by

22

this Court, it may never be corrected.

23

the problem that will never be corrected is this lack of

24

uniformity among the circuits on a matter that's so

25

clearly established by Congress.

4

And what the ­­

Congress does not require there to be

evidence in a notice of removal.

3

Florida or defendants in California don't have to

4

5

removal.

Defendants in the six States at issue in this

6

case do.

They are treated differently.

14

the way they acted.

15

Maybe the additional four will make

Maybe even those eight will think twice
I mean, in fact we just

It might have been because they thought that

16

the district court's decision was right, or it might

17

have been because they thought it ­­ that ­­ that

18

question is better ­­ was better decided in some other

19

context, or it might be because they were just feeling

20

too busy that day.

21

And ­­ and an abuse of discretion standard

22

would go, you know, to the ­­ just the decision whether

23

to take it, not knowing what that decision was based on.

24
25

MR. BERRETH:

Well, Justice Kagan, in this

situation, given what the Tenth Circuit has done and

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

given that the case has made it this far, as Judge Hartz

2

pointed out in his dissent below, it's highly unlikely

3

that a situation like this would arise again.

4

it takes an unusual confluence of circumstances to have

5

a case get here in the first place.

6

It's ­­

But now that we are here, lawyers in the

7

Tenth Circuit are more unlikely than ever to ­­ to allow

8

this problem to happen in the future, to allow this

9

to ­­ to re ­­ recur.

10

And so that is a main part of why this is an

11

unusual situation.

12

by the court of appeals that we are faced with.

13

It's not a garden variety decision

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not sure you're

14

joining issue with the question Justice Kagan asked.

15

we really not know why the Tenth Circuit did what it did

16

in this case?

Has there been

any suggestion at any point in this case ­­ in the

district court, in the court of appeals, in the papers

11

that have been filed here ­­ that the decision was based

12

on anything other than the reasoning of the district

14

Any other reason been given?

MR. BERRETH:

There has not been another

15

reason that's been given, and the reason that the

16

district court gave was clearly erroneous.

17

court clearly thought that she was constrained to ignore

18

evidence that all parties agreed is sufficient to

19

establish removal of jurisdiction in this case.

20

The district

This is a case where there's no dispute

21

about whether all of the elements necessary for Federal

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And when ­­

I'm ­­ I'm wondering in

3

some later case, could attorneys who want to remove

4

within the 30­day period seek mandate from the Tenth

5

Circuit to mandate the judge not to require the

6

evidence?

7

MR. BERRETH:

Well, they could ­­ I suppose

8

they could try something like that.

9

they're not required to.

I think that

Congress has told us that

10

they're not required to go to such extreme measures.

11

Congress has told us that what defendants are supposed

12

to do is, within 30 days of receiving the complaint or

13

another paper, either of which would put them on notice

14

that ­­ that there is the amount in controversy in play

15

here, that they are required to file their notice of

16

removal.

17

And in the Tenth Circuit, they have to go

get affidavits.

Hawaii or something.

21

filed.

Perhaps the CEO of the company is in

when that requirement simply does not exist in the plain

2

language of the statute.

3

not enforced in any of the other circuits.

4

And it doesn't exist ­­ it's

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Berreth, I ­­ I

5

apologize for going back to this not merits question,

6

but on the question of why the Tenth Circuit did what it

7

did, Judge Hartz, who was, of course, dissenting from

8

denial, made reference to the fact ­­ and I'm just

9

quoting here ­­ that the judges were very busy, and the

10

appeal presented a knotty matter that requires a

11

decision in short order.

12

So even he, who was trying to suggest that

13

an appeal should have been taken, was not suggesting

14

that the court did what it did because the court agreed

15

with the trial court.

16

MR. BERRETH:

Well, in a case like this

17

where all parties agree that there's a case in the court

18

of appeals, so that there is jurisdiction under Section

19

1254, the Forsyth v. Hammond case confirms that this

20

Court has the power, the certiorari power to ­­ to look

21

to the whole case, to look to any aspects of the case.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought Hohn, which

23

I think you used as explaining why the case is in the

24

court of appeals, but Hohn said the only thing that you

25

can review is the COA, certificate of appealability.

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

You can't use that handle to get to the merits.

2

So the only question is whether the

3
4

certificate was improperly denied and not the merits.

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

5

difference in that case was that the government conceded

not in dispute.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I thought ­­ are you

11

saying that all parties concede that this case is in the

12

court of appeals, both with respect to the proper

13

exercise of the court's jurisdiction in taking the case

14

and as to the merits?

15

MR. BERRETH:

That's right.

Once the case

16

is in the court of appeals, under Section 1254, Forsyth

17

confirms that this Court has the power to review any

18

aspect of the decision ­­

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I ­­ I think that's

20

contrary to Hohn, as Justice Ginsburg has just

indicated.

The court took both steps.

8

The court, number one, confirmed that it had

9

jurisdiction under Section 1254, which exists here; all

10

parties agree.

11

Fitzgerald went ahead and addressed the merits question,

12

which is what we asked the Court to do in this case,

13

because if the Court doesn't go ahead and address the

14

merits question in this case, there is a high likelihood

15

that the merits question won't be addressed, and that

16

we'll have one circuit alone that has this requirement

17

out there that flouts congressional intent.

And number two, the court in Nixon v.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How did the circuit

The circuit abused its

14

discretion by letting stand a decision that so plainly

15

violated the plain language of the statute that exists

17

that if it's not corrected now it may never be

corrected.

19

to this Court's desire for uniformity among the circuits

in the law, especially uniformity in a matter this

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX A. SHARP

16
17
18
19

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SHARP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The remand order should stand for at least

20

two reasons.

21

jurisdiction to review this case at all, on appeal or

22

otherwise, because the Tenth Circuit did not accept the

23

remand appeal under 1453.

First, 1447(d) bars this Court's

24

Consequently, this Court has no jurisdiction

25

at all to review this matter on appeal or certiorari or

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

any other way.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So ­­ so if the

3

court of appeals said we are not accepting this petition

4

because of the race of the person seeking removal,

5

that's just too bad?

6

We can't review that?

MR. SHARP:

If they give a reason, I think

7

this Court can review a reason.

8

a reason, it just simply does as this Court sometimes

9

does with a petition for certiorari ­­ denied ­­ there's

10
11

But if it doesn't give

nothing to review.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if every case in

12

which parties seek removal, a particular race of a

13

person seeking removal, their case is denied 100 out of

14

100 cases.

15

gosh, the one thing we ­­ we can't do is say why we are

16

doing it.

17

forever without any review by this Court?

18

We still don't have any basis and they know,

They have a blank check?

MR. SHARP:

No.

They can do that

I don't think you have a

19

blank check, because at the time it goes back to state

20

court, then comes up on final judgment, and this Court

21

would review the final judgment on whether the remand

22

was proper.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it was just pointed

24

out that lawyers in the Tenth Circuit are not going to

25

take that risk.

The Tenth Circuit precedent, which the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

district court followed, says you must produce in the

2

notice of appeal evidence.

3

So what lawyer is going to say to his

4

client, now, we can easily do that, but I won't because

5

I want to test whether the Tenth Circuit precedent is

6

wrong.

7

As a practical matter, this will be

8

unreviewable because the lawyers will simply conform to

9

what the Tenth Circuit says is the law.

10

MR. SHARP:

Your Honor, I think that's what

11

the dissent pointed out, is that, what lawyer would not

12

put on evidence after having that Tenth Circuit rule set

13

forth as it has been for the last 20 years.

14

do have this case where evidence wasn't presented.

15

their evidence was not presented, no one knows, but it

16

was clear that Dart had the evidence to present at the

17

time of this notice of removal but didn't present it.

But yet, we

that the amount was over the jurisdictional order.

You actually started out by

6

saying 1447(d), which I thought had nothing to do with

7

this case.

going ­­ the relevant statute is 1453(c)(1), which says

9

a court of appeals may accept an appeal, notwithstanding

That is, I thought that they ­­ they were

10

Section 1447(d), from an order of the district court

11

granting or denying a motion to remand.

12
13

All right?

So we are not talking about 1447(d); we are
talking about 1453(c)(1).

14

Now, what they did is they said they have an

15

order, and the order says, no, we won't accept it.

16

the question is, is that order reviewed in this Court?

17

I didn't think there was disagreement that it is

18

reviewable.

19

And

If they had said, We will not accept it

20

because if we think that it only applies to stoppage in

21

transitu cases, they would have their reason.

MR. SHARP:

generally does not have the evidence of how many class

8

It's the defendant that deals with all of the class

9

members on a class­wide or company­wide basis.

The

11

available, defendant does, and it usually has to be
