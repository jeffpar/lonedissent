ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The complaints in this case claim, as the

11

LearJet 1 says, quote, Defendant's conspiracy directly

12

13

conspiracy, they say, was false reporting to two common

14

indices, Gas Daily and Inside FERC.

The mechanism for that

15

These publications take in jurisdictional

16

and non­jurisdictional sales data, and push out sales

17

information for the entire market for both

18

jurisdictional and non­jurisdictional sales alike.

That's the fundamental reason why these complaints are

22

things, over the transportation or sale of

23

retailers is to complain to FERC and ask them to

The remedy for states or

causes of action, and directly regulating practices that

8

are common to both the retail and wholesale markets.

That's the crucial feature of this case.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is the crucial

11

feature, and as I'm a little bit out of date on this.

sales.

to.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Let's talk about

what they want to talk about.
Now, we have El Paso going in northern

13

Arizona to a manufacturer, and it says, I am going to

sell you a thousand cubic feet of natural gas at $48 a

15

thousand cubic feet.

16

You say, oh, my God, that's very high.

imagining very high price.

I have no choice.

Is there anyone I can complain to?

MR. KATYAL:

I have to

circumstance, Your Honor, because in that circumstance,

5

if the reason the rate is high is not a common practice,

6

that affects both markets simultaneously ­­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason that

8

it's high ­­ I'll tell you that it's ­­ why it's high.

9

It's high because the owner of El Paso has worked out he

10

can make more money that way.

11

MR. KATYAL:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is the only reason.

And ­­ and, Your Honor ­­
And I want to know if the

13

customer that used to be able to complain to somebody,

14

but can they complain now?

15

MR. KATYAL:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. KATYAL:

Yes, Your Honor.

So they can complain, in your

hypothetical, to the state itself why ­­

19

MR. KATYAL:

Who?

That ­­ that is incorrect,

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. KATYAL:

All right.
­­ because the this is

16

different in your hypothetical and in this case.

17

your hypothetical, it is true retail rate regulation.

18

1(b) gives that power directly to the states, and

19

crucial to our theory is the idea that if this is either

20

transportation or production or regulation of the sale

21

of the rate, which Louisiana Power is what ­­ says

22

that's what that proviso is, the states can undoubtedly

23

regulate that.

24

Here's the difference in this ­­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

In

Your point, I take it, is

8
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that the this happens to be the reason that the price is

2

higher; is not because the owner of El Paso said, ha,

3

ha, ha, let's make a lot of money.

4

owner of El Paso, in addition to that, said that the way

5

to make the extra money is to go out and manipulate

6

the ­­ the journals, the little gas journal, by lying to

would also get wholesale prices higher.

Let's assume that that's

24

let's assume that because of that, FERC clearly does

25

have authority to regulate in this area.

9
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

The question is whether FERC's authority

2

should be exclusive or whether it could be concurrent,

3

not field preemption.

4

MR. KATYAL:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right?
Right.
There would still be a kind

6

of rule of the road, even when field preemption runs

7

out, conflict preemption takes over, and it might be

8

that if the state regulation interfered with the goals

9

and objectives of the federal regulation, the federal

10
11

regulation would trump.
But I don't really see a reason in this kind

12

of case why you would exclude the state entirely, even

13

if nothing the state was doing was conflicting with

14

federal regulation or federal policy.

15

MR. KATYAL:

But, Justice Kagan, you asked a

16

similar question in Kerns, and I think the answer in

17

Kerns is the same as the answer it is here.

18

it's stronger here, which is that this is a field in

19

which this Court has said time and again is field

20

preempted.

21

exclusive jurisdiction ­­

When FERC acts in this area, it does provide

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. KATYAL:

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
I mean, yes, there is some

3

field preemption, but why should the field preemption

4

carry into a sphere where the practice being regulated

5

is commonly affected, both wholesales sales, which are

6

clearly in the bailiwick of the federal government, and

7

retail sales which are just as clearly in the bailiwick

8

of the state?

9

MR. KATYAL:

Well, precisely what this Court

10

said in Mississippi Power, page 374, quote, "We have

11

long rejected the sort of case­by­case analysis of the

12

impact of the state regulation upon the national

13

interest and power regulation cases."

14

Congress has drawn a bright line between

15

state and federal authority in the setting of wholesale

16

rates and in the regulation of agreements that affect

17

wholesale rates.

18

where FERC has properly exercised its jurisdiction ­­

19

States may not regulate in areas

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you agree that

20

FERC does not have the exclusive authority because you

21

have conceded that a federal antitrust claim would be

22

okay.

23

for federal antitrust claims.

24
25

So FERC is not the sole regulator.

MR. KATYAL:

There's room

Justice Ginsburg, we absolutely

agree that federal antitrust actions are available and

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would have been the remedy for any problems in this case

2

except for the litigation forfeiture by the other side.

3

We don't think that that somehow makes FERC ­­ ousts

4

FERC from being the exclusive regulator.

5

and again this Court has said there is a big difference

6

between displacement of federal statutes which have to

7

do with canons against implied repeal and the field

8

preemption analysis.

9

I think time

Indeed, in Connell v. Plumbers, this Court

10

said with respect to antitrust claims specifically,

says.

17

Because federal statutes can be harmonized one to

both, the input is going into the index, wholesale and

retail, and the outputs that are both wholesale and

that is, the jurisdictional entities that are actually

FERC, in our view, has authority to regulate

under Section 5 and Section 1 the practices of those

jurisdictional sellers that directly affect the

But with respect to the questions here, we

think that would be controlled by the EPA Act and not by

That said, prior to 2005, our view is FERC

did have authority to regulate the jurisdictional

We haven't analyzed this under a

depend on an analysis of what the state law prohibitions

20

were vis­à­vis the federal prohibitions.

21

if you were to adopt only a conflict preemption type of

22

a ­­ a regime, then you would have to at least have the

state's accept a FERC determination of the lawfulness of

these types of practices and then take that as a given

25

in determining whether there is further conflict.

24
Alderson Reporting Company

We think that

Official

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure, that seems right.

But

2

I mean, is there anything that FERC has said now about

3

these practices that would suggest a conflict with this

4

state regulation?

5

MR. YANG:

It's ­­ we have not analyzed it,

6

and it's difficult for us at this point in the

7

litigation where there seems to be flux in the

characterization of what the state laws claims are and

9

there's not been adjudication of what the state law

10

requires for us to determine whether there is conflict

power.

6

And in Section 5(a), which

state and federal market where, in our view, the states

could, if they wished to, carve off their own markets

They have not done so.

13

But where you have that merging and both the

manipulation are both whole ­­ related the wholesale and

MR. FISHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

This is an anti­trust case, and the

18

plaintiffs claims here are very simple.

19

paid too much in retail transactions for natural gas

20

because the defendants conspired to fix prices.

21

this is important for two reasons, each of which

It's that they

And

First, because the state regulation here is

fall outside any field FERC could possibly regulate

because, as my opponents have conceded, FERC has no

power under Otter Tail and California v. FPC.

6

And, secondly, the claims necessarily

7

be an exaggeration to say it ­­ it falls squarely within

regulation of prices.

This is not a state

It's ­­ it's state regulation of

10

a practice that affects state prices, retail prices, but

11

also affects wholesale prices.

12

MR. FISHER:

It's a little different.

Well, Justice Scalia, let me

13

say two things about that that are very important.

14

First, the statutory word is "sales."

15

reserves to the states is the power to regulate retail,

16

quote, sales.

17

has twice spoken directly to what that means, first in

18

the 1947 Panhandle case and second in the 1997 General

19

Motors v. Tracy case.

20

the Court made very clear that the state's power to

21

regulate sales goes far beyond setting a price

22

themselves.

7

Now, there is what used to be a further

8

bizarre and unusual occurrence which is now common.

On

9

the way, El Paso sells directly to a manufacturer.

And

10

that seems to be at the heart of your case.

11

MR. FISHER:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Right.

So now I'm thinking

13

we're back to cost of service ratemaking.

14

cost of service ratemaking, you have FERC which said

15

El Paso is charging too much money for sales for resales

16

because it doesn't do its depreciation properly.

17

You'd better load them.

18

Suppose under

Okay.

Now, suppose a state via antitrust or any

19

other way said the reason that the sales that are direct

20

to the manufacturer are unlawful under state law is

21

because it doesn't do its depreciation properly, and

22

suppose that the depreciation the state is talking about

23

is identical to the depreciation that FERC is talking

24

about.

25

I would say absolute preemption.

29
Alderson Reporting Company

And if I'm

Official

1

right about that, in this case, we don't have

2

depreciation rules, but we have price setting by

3

consulting Joe's Gas Journal.

4

is saying is the consultation with Joe's Gas Journal

5

that the state wishes to make unlawful is identical to

6

the consultation with Joe's Gas Journal that FERC wants

7

to make unlawful and upon which rests FERC's wholesale

8

price determination.

9

And if the one is field preempted, so is the other.

10

Okay?

And here, what the state

Just like the depreciation.

Now that's the analogy I've been going

11

through in my mind, just waiting to ask you, because I

12

would be very interested in your response.

13

MR. FISHER:

So that's the best version of

14

the other sides argument, but it's not this case.

15

just described Mississippi Power, Justice Breyer, where

16

the state wanted to second­guess what FERC had done.

17

Here, the state has no second­guessing.

this is terrible what happened, as do the states.

So let ­­

That's exactly right.

And so

it's critical, but let me explain why we're in conflict

preemption, and I turn back to Justice Scalia's question

In this case, the Court says, "In the

present case, it is argued that each agency acts within

18

its assigned sphere, and the Court has observed there is

19

no provision in the statute itself to resolve such

20

jurisdictional tensions."

21

And here is the solution, "Only by applying

22

conflict preemption analysis can we be assured that both

state and federal regulatory schemes may operate with

24

some degree of harmony."

25

And I would tell you there is no other

If

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, yes, but wait.

11

Suppose, in our classical system years ago, that El Paso

12

Gas gets a price set for resale at FERC equal to three

13

dollars a thousand cubic feet, and then the Ohio

14

regulator, in regulating the price of the distribution

company, forces it down for the reason that it thinks

16

that three dollars for the wholesale part is too high.

Not close.

MR. FISHER:

prices.

you use the ­­ you use the index prices as a peg, but then

23

you can add and subtract to that depending on what kind

of sale and the volume and the like.

of using it as a peg, Justice Sotomayor, is an important

37
Alderson Reporting Company

But even the act

insight, because it is wholly voluntary that they even

2

use it for wholesale transactions.

3

And so if they are right, then as soon as a

4

given practice affects wholesale rates, and it's their

5

completely voluntary decision to make that so, you would

6

be giving them a get­out­of­jail­free card if you turn

Section 5A into a field preemption statute.

3

What we're saying is, if you transform

have the difficulty of giving the defendants themselves,

or any malefactors themselves in the market, complete

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Fisher, there is a

Define the field.

How

would you define what the field is?
MR. FISHER:

The field is what the Court

17

said in Schneidewind, which is the field is practices

18

relating to wholesale transactions.

19

regulation that is directed at that field is preempted.

20

Now, as I've explained, it is field preempted if the

21

state cannot bring themselves under the Section 1(b)

proviso.

But if I could turn to the second argument

2

in our case, is that the words "directed at" are very

3

important, because that's the words the Court used in

4

Schneidewind, which my opponents say is their best case.

5

All state regulation directed at FERC's field of

6

wholesale transactions is field preemption.

7

For two reasons, our anti­trust claims are

not directed at FERC's field.

First, they are generally

The Court has never used the Natural Gas Act, in all of

13

Schneidewind, aimed at the natural gas industry.

15

FERC protects ­­ I'm sorry, the Natural Gas Act protects

And is that because you

rely on a conflict preemption theory?
MR. FISHER:

That's the proper way to go

6

about this, and nothing in the code of conduct conflicts

7

with anything that we're asking for.

8

Ottertail and California v. FPC hold is that FERC would

9

lack the power to condone these actions.

And remember, what

It's not just

10

that they didn't; it's that they would lack the power.

11

So this is why the ­­ the contrast I wanted

12

to draw with Kurns.

14

that what Congress had done there is give everything to

therefore the States couldn't tread on the field that

Congress had given to the agency.

JUSTICE BREYER:

of wholesale rates; that is, sales for resale.

It's important to understand

If you want to talk about the original

10

of this Court that said there was certain territory the

11

transportation and wholesale transactions.

So the

MR. McALLISTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, 5(a) as

2

is being argued here, in the State's view, is a massive

3

expansion of anything Congress ever intended in the

4

Natural Gas Act.

5

And if you go back to the Court's earliest Natural Gas

6

Act decisions, the 1940s, the Panhandle cases ­­ there

7

are a series of them, even into the early 1960s ­­ you
