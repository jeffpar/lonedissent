ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ELWOOD:

10

please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

11

The First Amendment permits restrictions on

12

the content of speech for a few well­defined, narrowly

13

limited classes of communication clearly supported by

14

history and tradition, including what this Court has

15

called "true threats."

16

justify ­­

17

The government has failed to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not sure that

18

the Court did either the law or the English language

19

much of a good service when it said "true threat."

20

could mean so many things.

21

really intend to carry it out, A; you really intend to

22

intimidate the person; or that no one could possibly

23

believe it.

It

It could mean that you

So I don't ­­

24

MR. ELWOOD:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's true.
We can't fault you for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

citing what the Supreme Court has said, but it's a most

2

unhelpful phrase.

3

MR. ELWOOD:

And it also doesn't help that

4

it was announced in a per curiam decision that didn't

5

have the benefit of merits briefing or argument.

6

But if you look at the tradition,

7

threatening speech was not punishable at common law.

8

And until the late 20th Century, American threat

9

statutes required or were interpreted to require proof

10

of a subjective intent to place the listener in fear,

11

and because of that ­­

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that was an assault

13

at common law, wasn't it?

14

with violence and don't actually apply violence, it's

15

still an assault, isn't it?

16

MR. ELWOOD:

If you threatened somebody

I think assault is somewhat

17

different because assault can also be an attempted

18

battery.

19

that to the question that assault, when it involved

20

placing someone in fear, did require a specific intent.

21

But it's my understanding

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

there is law

How does one prove what's

22

in somebody else's mind?

23

would a reasonable person think that the words would put

24

someone in fear, and reasonable people can make that

25

judgment.

This case, the standard was

But how would the government prove whether

Alderson Reporting Company

this threat in the mind of the threatener was genuine?

2

MR. ELWOOD:

I think two ways, generally

3

speaking.

4

prove up these threats which are increasingly made

5

online using a cell phone or a computer, you will have

6

to search the computer and cell phone to show that it

7

was actually used to make these statements.

You will

8

also find on there a wealth of information.

As

9

the Court indicated in Riley, people conduct their

10

As we indicated in our brief, in order to

entire lives electronically ­­

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, you are going

12

to find a lot of information on the cell phone that the

13

guy is really angry at his ex­wife and ­­ and, you know,

14

would like to see her suffer.

15

online, and then you are going to say, well, that was

16

just therapeutic, as you said in your brief.

It's a good thing that he

22

point is that there is a lot of information that you

23

could find.

24

visited a web page and she confided to someone else that

25

she was in fear.

You could find, for example, that he had

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How does the fact ­­

2

I thought your whole point was the fact that she is in

3

fear doesn't tell you enough about what the defendant

4

wants.

5

MR. ELWOOD:

No, but if he ­­ if you can see

6

that he visited her website at the time that she was

7

saying, I'm afraid of this guy or I'm afraid of what he

8

is saying, you could say ­­ you could prove up that he

9

knew at the time, that he was aware ­­

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Based on your

11

submission, all he has to do is say either, as I

12

understood your brief, it's therapeutic, it's a good

13

thing I could do this, or it's art.

14

MR. ELWOOD:

If he is on notice that she's

15

in fear, that is all we're asking for.

16

she is in fear, he doesn't have a right to continue on.

17

That is what we view as stating an intent to cause fear.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I ­­

off of Justice Ginsburg's question.

how and what was said in words, correct?

25

MR. ELWOOD:

You can infer what

That is correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if that's the case,

2

isn't the jury acting like a reasonable person in

3

looking at the words and the circumstances and saying,

4

did he intend this or didn't he?

5

what the difference between the standard given and the

6

one ­­ the instruction you want.

7

MR. ELWOOD:

I mean, I don't know

As the government put it in

8

this case in the closing argument, under the instruction

9

that was given it doesn't matter

what the defendant

10

thinks.

11

would foresee that the listener would be placed in fear

12

and so it is essentially ­­

13

What matters is whether a reasonable person

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But ­­ I mean, how is

14

that different from what you intend?

15

reasonable person is going to read these words this way,

16

aren't they going to assume that's what the defendant

17

intended?

MR. ELWOOD:

If you know if a

aware of that.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Elwood, sort of along

the same lines, and getting back to what the

25

Chief Justice asked you, because I was a little bit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

surprised by your answer:

2

exactly the level of intent you want is.

3

very, very highest level might be I affirmatively want

4

to place this person in fear; that's why I'm doing what

5

I'm doing.

6

I'm trying to figure out what
So one, the

All right?

There's a step down from that which is:

I

7

don't want to do that; I'm just fulfilling my artistic

8

fantasies, whatever you want to call it; but I know that

9

I am going to place this person in fear.

10

All right?

Is

that what ­­ which intent do you want?

11

MR. ELWOOD:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

MR. ELWOOD:

The second.
The second.
That if you know that you are

14

placing someone in fear by what you are doing, that is

15

enough to satisfy our version of ­­

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How about you just take it a

17

step down more but not get to the government's.

18

about if you don't know to a certainty, but you know

19

that there is a substantial probability that you will

20

place that person in fear, which is what I take it we

21

would usually mean when we talk about recklessness?

22

MR. ELWOOD:

How

I think that we would say that

23

recklessness is not enough.

24

Gypsum that recklessness and negligence were not enough

25

for mens rea even for antitrust liability.

The Court said in U.S.

Alderson Reporting Company

So we would

Official

9
1

say the same would apply here.

2

Traditionally courts have applied and in

3

Global­Tech the Supreme Court, this Court, said that

4

willful blindness satisfies knowledge, but the willful

5

blindness test spelled out in Global­Tech was beyond

6

recklessness and it took an extra step to try to

7

distinguish it from recklessness.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what would be wrong

with a recklessness standard?

Why is that too low?

It

10

seems that a recklessness standard has a kind of buffer

11

zone around it.

12

what the government wants, so what ­­ who is the person

13

that we should be worried is going to be convicted under

14

a recklessness standard?

15

You know, it gets you up one level from

MR. ELWOOD:

I think many of the speakers

16

who are online and many of the people who are being

17

prosecuted now are teenagers who are essentially

18

shooting off their mouths or making sort of ill­timed,

19

sarcastic comments which wind up getting them thrown in

20

jail.

21

For example, there is pending now a case

22

involving a couple of Texas teenagers who were in a

23

video game chat room.

24

apparently for something that he said about a video

25

game, and the other one responded:

One called the other one crazy,

12

talking about what a reasonable person would view that

13

as, I would not want to bet a felony conviction that

14

that would not be covered­­

15

So there is a

But if you are

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not just a

16

reasonable person, at least as I understand the

17

government's submission.

18

familiar with the context of the statement.

19

you don't take what is on the Internet in the abstract

20

and say, this person wants to do something horrible.

21

You are familiar with the context.

22

with the fact that this was a couple of teenagers in a

23

chat room playing a game, right?

24
25

MR. ELWOOD:

It's a reasonable person
Right?

So

You are familiar

That is true, but the thing is

everyone has a different view of what context matters.

4

All they

And one of the things that always matters in

5

these reasonable person prosecution is how do you

respond.

7

investigated, they informed the school, and that is ­­

8

there is a bootstrapping quality of the reasonable

9

person test, because if you reacted to it, and

And the fact of the matter is they

presumably law enforcement will react in any case that's

thought on the basis of the briefs that there are two

separate questions.

to do this or he's not guilty, is he has to communicate

What is a true threat?

21

MR. ELWOOD:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well ­­
A true threat ­­ you've

23

seen the definitions, the instruction that was given is

24

similar to ones that are well­embodied in the law.

25

you have to do is communicate a true threat, and a true

Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official

12
1

threat is a threat that a reasonable person would

2

understand to convey a serious expression of an

3

intention to inflict bodily injury or take the life of

4

an individual.

5

Now, there is a second question which I find

6

more difficult and that has nothing to do with what you

7

do.

8

what I want to know your view about.

9

nothing in the government's brief that says a person

It has to do with the state of mind, and that is
Because I saw

10

could be convicted through negligence.

11

they say, and it seemed to me this is hornbook statement

12

of criminal law, is that you have to know that you are

13

doing those things that are the elements of the crime.

14

So you have to know that you are transmitting in

15

commerce a true threat, as I've just defined it.

16

you don't know that, you are out.

17

Rather, what

And if

You are home free.

Now, that I would say is Model Penal Code.

18

That is Brown Commission.

19

statement of criminal law that I've read, which may be

20

only a few, but I don't know many that contradict that.

21

And so why isn't that the end of this case?

22

MR. ELWOOD:

That is every sort of

Because I think the way ­­ the

23

way you are explaining it is different than the way I

24

think the government is explaining because you seem to

25

be suggesting that he knows that a reasonable person

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

He has to know that, and I

will ask the government.

think what they are saying is the way I said it.

they will say perhaps something else, but that is up to

7

them.

I will ask the government the

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

for the moment, what do you think of the position I just

12

took, which is my question?

13
14
15

MR. ELWOOD:

The way I understood your

position is he has to know that a reasonable person ­­

Yes, he does.

Just as if

you go into a bank, you have to know certain elements

for it to be bank robbery.

3

MR. ELWOOD:

If ­­ if the government's view

is he has to know ­­ Mr. Elonis had to know that a

5

reasonable person would interpret that as a threat, I

6

would think that that would be a big improvement.

7

would not view that as a bad thing at all.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you wouldn't go along

with that.

10
11

I

MR. ELWOOD:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

the intention of the sender, doesn't it?

7

MR. ELWOOD:

Because I think ­­ again, we're

8

just talking a threat is only ­­ you know, the question

9

is whether it's your statement of intent to cause harm

10

versus your warning somebody of somebody else's intent

11

to cause harm.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. ELWOOD:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

Well ­­

But ­­
Exactly.

That's a big

15

difference, and ­­ and I had thought that your position

16

took account of that difference, that you had to intend

17

to place somebody in ­­ in ­­ in fear.

18
19
20
21
22

MR. ELWOOD:

That is right.

It is our

position that you have to intend to place someone ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Once you eliminate that,

you ­­ you can accept Justice Breyer's position.
MR. ELWOOD:

But among the many things that

23

is wrong with that is, I mean, I'm not the only one who

24

says this is a negligence standard.

25

said it, Judge Sutton said it.

Justice Marshall

And that's because you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

are basing it not on what he knew, but on what a

2

reasonable person would have known under the

3

circumstances.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But is it your position

5

that a properly instructed jury can convict if it is

6

instructed that the defendant in ­­ communicated the

7

threat with the intent to cause fear or intimidation to

8

the victim?

9

MR. ELWOOD:

Yes, that's correct.

10

One of the things ­­

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12
13
14

accept anything less than that in this case?
MR. ELWOOD:

I think that the closest thing

is that he knew that a reasonable person ­­

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. ELWOOD:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18
19

And would in ­­ would you

I mean, you can say no.
­­ would be placed in fear ­­
But that's what this ­­

that's what ­­ that's the way I read this instruction.
MR. ELWOOD:

And that's ­­ I disagree.

It's

20

if a reasonable person ­­ not if he knew that a

21

reasonable person would have that reaction, but what a

22

reasonable person ­­

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But he intentionally makes

a statement.
MR. ELWOOD:

He intentionally makes a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

statement, and it happens ­­ he intentionally makes a

2

statement, he says these words and, full stop, a

3

reasonable person viewing those words would view it as a

4

threat.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

MR. ELWOOD:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

But then it ­­

And that's why ­­
­­ then seems to me that

8

you can't accept anything lesser than the instruction

9

that we first agreed upon is your position ­­ is your

10
11

preferred position.
MR. ELWOOD:

Again, it's my understanding

12

that the government is not accepting the idea that if he

13

knew that a reasonable person would be placed in fear,

14

he would be guilty.

15

that if he knew the words he said, and also, a

16

reasonable person would view those as a threat, he is

17

guilty.

18

the Rogers case, a negligent argument.

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

My understanding is they're saying

It is, as you know, Justice Marshall said in

And I want to point out something on page 15
of their brief.

They say that he ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of the ­­ of the

government's brief?
MR. ELWOOD:

Of the government's brief,

right.
It says that a general­intent requirement

18

allows him to be convicted so long as it is sufficient

2

to preclude a conviction based on facts that the

3

defendant could not reasonably have known.

4

admitting there that he could be convicted of facts that

5

he didn't know but he reasonably could have known.

6

So it is ­­

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

So they're

I thought your answer to

8

Justice Kagan a few minutes ago was that it is not

9

necessary for the defendant to have the purpose of

10

causing fear, but it's sufficient for the ­­ for the

11

defendant to have knowledge that it will cause fear.

12

MR. ELWOOD:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's right.
Which of the two is it?

I

14

thought a minute ago, though, in answering Justice

15

Kennedy, I thought you said that intent, which I take to

16

mean purpose, is what's necessary.

17

MR. ELWOOD:

This is one of the things

18

that ­­ the reason why we all hate the pre­Model Penal

19

Code era, but if you look at LaFave.

20

as subjective intent, it includes both purpose, which

21

we're not asking for, and knowledge that it's a virtual

22

certainty that something is going to happen and you do

23

it any way.

24

LaFave includes,

So how does the government prove that?

11

MR. ELWOOD:

The government would prove it

12

by, you know, proving the circumstances, what he said,

14

personal statements about things at the time.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

On the facts of this case

20

21

though, and if I could point, I mean, one thing in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, wait.

Before ­­

24

before you depart from ­­ from your ­­ your view, I had

25

understood that to be your view.

But if I understand it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20

correctly, when you have this disaffected divorced

2

husband who wants to place his former wife in fear, he

3

doesn't call her up, but a friend of his who knows about

4

his malicious intent calls up the former wife and says,

5

you know, your former husband has threatened to kill

6

you.

7

Now, why wouldn't that meet all of the ­­

8

all of the requirements that you insist upon, knowing

9

that this would cause fear in her?

The only thing

10

missing is it is not his purpose to cause fear in her.

11

But once you depart from that purpose, you ­­ you open

12

the door to a situation like that which, it doesn't seem

13

to me, should be covered.

14

MR. ELWOOD:

I ­­ I may have been

15

distracted, but I thought it was the idea that ­­ I

17

results in his wife being told that he wants to kill

MR. ELWOOD:

Well, in any event, it is our

understanding that when I say this, it will put that

that, you know, there is a ­­ there are a plethora of

24

statutes that require subjective intent, you know, fraud

And it could be proved ­­ you

Mr. Elwood, when we have

this kind of heightened intent.

It's a very different

is much more time for sort of law enforcement inquiry.

14

There's options other than just immediately cuffing the

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

20

This Court has made clear that true threats,

21

which may not be the best term in the world to describe

22

them but it is getting at an important point, cause fear

23

and disruption to society and to the individuals who are

24

targeted, and for that reason, Congress enacted a

25

statute that depends upon a mens rea component and an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

actus reus component.

2

The mens rea component is that the

3

individual has to know and understand what the

4

individual is saying.

5

people who are speakers of the English language and who

6

know that the words ­­ what the meaning of the words is

7

that they speak are accountable for the consequences of

8

those words.

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:
what?

11

Congress reasonably presumed that

And the minimum penalty is

A fine, right?
MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

There is a

12

minimum penalty ­­ there is no mandatory minimum prison

13

sentence here.

The important point, I find ­­

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. DREEBEN:

But it is a felony.
Yes, it is a felony and I

16

think that Congress was quite clear that when it enacted

17

this it did not prescribe any additional specific intent

18

or purpose to frighten or to threaten that Petitioner,

19

up until standing at the podium today, appeared to argue

20

for.

21

not a threat if somebody can say, hey, didn't really

22

mean it, sorry, that wasn't my purpose or intent.

23

knew that the words that I were speaking had the

24

language in them that they did.

25

reasonable person would have interpreted them that way.

Petitioner's position until today was that it's

I

I can take it that a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

Petitioner would even cut out recklessness.

2

Even if the speaker was consciously aware that it was

3

likely to cause fear, Petitioner would say ­­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's ­­ can you go

5

back?

6

I'm ­­ I'm with you down to forget the purpose.

7

with you there has to be a true threat; we'll assume

8

that.

9

general requirement for mens rea where there's just a

10
11

That's exactly the point that is bothering me.
I'm

And now the question is knowledge, and that's the

general ­­ that's the normal rule, knowledge.
And you have to know those portions that

12

make up an actus reus.

13

One of the elements is a true threat.

14

What do you say you have to know there?

15

your brief, you first said he has to know, he has to

16

understand the meaning of the words he speaks in context

17

and must intentionally speak them, and is showing that

18

the defendant acted knowingly in transmitting a true

19

threat requires proof the defendant knew he transmitted

20

a communication and he comprehended its context and

21

context.

You have to know the elements.
So I thought:
And when I read

22

Now, when I first read that ­­ you hear my

23

clerks have disagreed with me ­­ I thought, well, that

24

means he has to know that it is a true threat; i.e.,

25

that a reasonable ­­ why did I think that?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. DREEBEN:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I ­­
You just saw people being

3

sworn in.

4

hears them say "I do, I do, I promise," does he know the

5

meaning of the words?

Unless he knows the action ­­ so

6

a marriage is better.

Someone who has never seen

7

marriages hears the bride say, "I do."

8

understood the meaning in context, in context of those

9

words, if he doesn't know that that means they're

10

married and go through a lot of legal proceeding?

11

similarly, can a person know the meaning in context of

12

true threat unless he understands, just like the words

13

"I do," what a true threat is.

14

Suppose someone comes from, I don't know,

MR. DREEBEN:

Has the person

And

The individual can know the

15

meaning of the words without necessarily drawing the

16

same conclusion that the recipient of the communication

17

or a reasonable person would.

Justice, because in the context of those statements,

perfect freedom to do is to make statements that are

is that there must be a purpose to frighten.

what the statute means and is properly interpreted and

what the Fourth Amendment requires, but there was no

JUSTICE ALITO:

My understanding of the

Model Penal Code levels of mens rea is that there is a

6

distinction, but a razor­thin distinction, between

7

purpose and knowledge.

8

from purpose to knowledge is going to make very much

9

So the idea that backing off

There is a

10

considerable difference between ­­ distance between

do I not understand that correctly.

3

these cases would come up in domestic relations disputes

4

and in such a case, the question would be ­­ because

5

people get into heated arguments ­­ do you have to show

6

the defendant used some words that, in context, would be

7

taken as a true threat, or do you have to show that the

characteristic?

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, so the jury instruction

8

in this case said right before the passage that we've

9

all been focused on, which is on page 301 of the Joint

10

Appendix among many other places, is that after giving

11

the definition of a true threat, Justice Breyer,

12

the court said, "This is distinguished from idle or

13

careless talk, exaggeration, something said in a joking

14

manner, or an outburst of transitory anger."

15

So the context of this very instruction took

16

into account Your Honor's concern and it cuts that out.

of public concern, where there really was a social

Here what you are talking about are criminal

11

threats, statements that, taking away any private

meanings that the individual attached to them, would

leave observers of the view, hey, this guy intends to

carry out an act of violence against somebody.

That is

not something that has First Amendment value.

overthrown, there is going to be a tremendous chill.

24

until recently, 11 out of the 12 circuits followed this

25

rule, the Tenth Circuit changed only while this case is

And the proof, I think, really is in
Petitioner claims that unless the

Alderson Reporting Company

under submission, and there is no evidence of chilling.

2

The best evidence that Petitioner has come

3

up with of a case that was actually prosecuted that he

4

thinks shouldn't, was one in which an individual, after

5

having tried to urge an FBI agent to recommend a

6

prosecution and failing, called him up and said, you

7

know, have a good day, the silver bullets are coming.

8

And the jury was able to hear in that case a tape of the

9

statement, put the statement in the context in which it

10

was made and conclude that it was indeed a true threat.

11

Plus, the very statute of prosecution actually did

12

require proof of an intent to impede an official engaged

13

in his business.

14

So I don't think Petitioner has really come

15

up with a good reason for this Court to change course.

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think you would agree with

Yes.
Is it proper for us then

22

to say that it's likely that section (c) also should be

23

a specific ­­ it's very odd to say that (a), (b) and (d)

24

are specific intents but this one isn't.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

that it actually cuts the other way because Congress, in

2

the other sections of this statute, focused on an intent

3

to extort.

4

in 875(c), it did not do that.

5

And when it came down to prohibiting threats

I think it's also notable that Section 871,

6

which is the Threats Against the President statute,

7

requires that the threats be made knowingly and

8

willfully.

9

interpreted, except for the Fourth Circuit, as not

And that statute has been universally

10

requiring any proof of an intent or knowledge that it

11

would be taken as threatening language that was designed

12

to put the President in fear.

13

just the way the Third Circuit interpreted this statute,

14

and if Petitioner's statutory argument is accepted that

15

the word

16

"threat" has some sort of an inherent meaning of an

17

intent to put somebody in fear, it raises questions

18

about that almost uniform and longstanding

was in the person's head?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

in a defamation statute, and the harms that defamation

There is no
