CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

5

Hargis Industries.

Mr. Jay.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM JAY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. JAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Lanham Act contains only one concept of

12

likelihood of confusion.

13

in this case decided the same issue, and that is why

14

issue of preclusion is appropriate.

15

considering registration or infringement or both at the

16

same time, the statutory test is the same, whether the

17

resemblance of the marks as used on particular goods

18

would give rise to a likelihood of confusion or mistake

19

or deceit.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is why the two tribunals

Whether a court is

Mr. Jay, there are

21

exceptions to preclusion even though you would see the

22

identical issue, and one of them is when the stakes are

23

higher in the second proceeding than in the first and,

24

indeed, the restatement of judgments gives some

25

examples of that.

And it seems to me this is such a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

case, because it's one thing to say that we won't

2

register your mark and another to say you can't use the

3

mark.

4

MR. JAY:

There is an exception for when ­­

5

when the stakes are different, Justice Ginsburg, but I

6

think that the difference has to be a difference of an

7

order of magnitude greater than we're dealing with here.

8

So I think the best example in the restatement is the

9

example of a small claims court.

Small claims courts

10

are set up in such a way that their designers understand

11

their judgments won't be preclusive and that's what gets

12

people to litigate there.

13

Here the stakes are different, but I don't

14

think it can be said that the stakes before the

15

Trademark Trial and Appeal Board are so low.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't think that your

17

example of small claims court is the closest.

18

one on section 83, which is determinations by an

19

administrative tribunal, and the example it gives is of

20

a scheme that contemplates an agency proceeding to be as

21

expeditious as possible.

22

expeditiousness is to confine the stakes to the matter

23

immediately in controversy.

24
25

MR. JAY:

There's

And one way of assuring

The matter immediately in

controversy, though, in ­­ in this case, the matter is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5

2

the same and the ­­ the way that ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The matter in controversy

3

is registration, and in the second proceeding, it's

4

infringement.

5

MR. JAY:

That's correct.

That's why

6

there's no claim preclusion, for example.

7

sense, they are different, but the inquiry that the two

8

tribunals are asking is the same.

9

So in that

And to say that the ­­ the stakes are

10

different, certainly, they're different, but I don't

11

think that they are sufficiently different that you can

12

infer from that that Congress wanted the trademark

13

board's judgments not to be preclusive.

14

And I would encourage the Court to think

15

about the ways in which the trademark board decides

16

issues that will be, I think everyone would agree,

17

exactly the same in subsequent litigation such as

18

priority.

19

to register a mark, who's the senior mark, and who's ­­

20

and who's the junior mark.

21

frequently decides that factual question, who came

22

first, who started using it in commerce first.

23

there's no reason to think that Congress would want that

24

factual matter relitigated in a subsequent infringement

25

action without regard to the proceeding that's come

Priority is the key to determining who gets

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose ­­
Well, just ­­
I suppose in one sense

5

the ­­ the trademark determination is broader rather

6

than narrower than the infringement determination,

7

right?

8

one alleged infringer whereas the trademark registration

9

would register the trademark as against the world.

10
11

The infringement determination just applies to

So

I'm not sure that it's terribly narrower.
MR. JAY:

Well, in the ­­ in an opposition

12

or cancellation proceeding, Justice Scalia, there ­­

13

there is a concrete dispute between the holders of two

14

marks.

15

nationwide as against the world that gives you

16

priority as of a certain date.

17

But you're right that a registration is a right

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But ­­ but the person who

18

uses the mark could continue to use it.

19

the restatement gives before the expeditious first

20

proceeding is that you don't want to make that

21

proceeding pull out all the stops because it's going to

22

be determinative of the infringement suit.

23

MR. JAY:

And the reason

But I think you could say the

24

same, Justice Ginsburg, if the Trademark Trial and

25

Appeal Board's decision were appealed to a U.S. District

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7

Court or to the Federal Circuit.

2

the same.

The stakes would be

The stakes would still be registration.

3

But I don't understand the other side to be

4

saying that that tribunal's judgment would not be

5

preclusive because ­­ because of a difference in the

6

stakes.

7

be sure.

8

confuse ­­ of likelihood of confusion in infringement

9

proceedings is different than the legal issue in

10
11

They're saying that the issues are different to
They're saying that the legal issue of

registration proceedings.
But I think once you get past that argument,

12

and I think the statute and the history and the

13

structure all dispatch that, then I think that the ­­ I

14

don't think that the notion that the stakes are

15

different can save Respondents from preclusion here.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would you agree that if we

17

accept your argument, the number of cases in which the

18

elements of issue preclusion will be met by the TTAB

19

proceeding will be relatively rare?

20

case, is it worthwhile to create a rule that applies

21

only in that very limited set of circumstances?

22

MR. JAY:

And if that is the

I think, Justice Alito, that the

23

number of circumstances in which the ­­ our rule would

24

apply depends on the number of circumstances in which

25

people seek to register the same goods that they are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

actually using.

2

people file registrations for goods that they don't

3

intend to use and that their actual use in real life

4

will be different.

5

Now, it's certainly true that sometimes

But I do think that for the 40­some odd

6

percent of registrations that are ­­ deal with marks

7

already in use, that generally, when an applicant comes

8

to the patent office and says, I'd like to register a

9

trademark for use on these goods, that it's the goods

10

that that person is already using.

11

rule when the marks are the same, the goods are the

12

same, and they're sold in the same channels of commerce,

13

that's when it's appropriate for preclusion to apply.

14

So that under our

And I don't think that that's such a

15

vanishingly small set of circumstances that you would

16

say the game isn't worth the candle.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have a bit of a

18

problem, okay?

19

year or two terms ago ­­ I've now lost track of time ­­

20

that an applicant who loses before the board can

produce everything.

24

when there is new evidence?

25

we owe then?

We have held that in ­­ in Kappos last

So we have made

So what happens in the situation

Is it ­­ that's why I think Justice Alito

said this might be a unique case because I ­­ then ­­

2

your adversary may tell me and tell me differently ­­

3

the two proceedings had almost identical evidence.

4

MR. JAY:

That is certainly our position,

5

that the proceedings were the same.

6

Respondent has identified is this point about the

7

two­word phrase, "building fasteners," which I'd be

8

happy to come back to.

The only difference

Honor's question.

effect of a district court's judgment would be if new

13

You're asking what the preclusive

the court gives?

What deference does the court ask to

MR. JAY:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think ­­

22

that existed before.

23

MR. JAY:

It didn't have evidence

Well, I think that there are ­­

24

there are two different questions.

25

marks are the same, the goods are the same, and they're

Alderson Reporting Company

One is whether the

1

2

that's ­­ that is what would line up the infringement

3

proceeding with the registration proceeding.

4

And saying I have new evidence that I would

5

like to introduce that I didn't introduce before, you

6

have the option to go up to the district court on review

7

of the trademark board proceeding.

8

option, and that's what ­­ that is the significance of

9

Kappos v. Hyatt.

10

You always have that

If you don't take that option, I think you

11

should not expect in the infringement litigation to say,

12

well, preclusion doesn't apply merely because I think I

13

have some new evidence.

14

And that's a bedrock principle of the law on

15

judgments, that new evidence is not enough to get you

16

right to preclusion, but ­­

the effects of full preclusion.

MR. JAY:

If you could have, you should

have.

24

are matters that the trademark board will not

25

adjudicate, and there certainly are ways in which

Now, there certainly will be ­­ there certainly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

infringement litigation can differ and that the simplest

2

way is if the goods are different.

3

register a broad array of goods and the trademark board

4

finds a likelihood of confusion based on that broad

5

array of goods in your registration, but the

6

infringement action turns only on one ­­ you know, one

7

good within that set, jeans instead of all clothing, for

8

example, then I think preclusion wouldn't apply.

9

that's the way the Federal Circuit applies it going in

So if you seek to

And

10

the opposite direction, that if infringement ­­ if

11

infringement ­­ that no confusion judgment turns only on

12

a tiny subset of the goods listed in the registration.

Well, then, of course the issue is different because ­­

5

doesn't want to go to the time and trouble of having

6

7

lo and behold, later on it turns out this is a very big

8

deal to him.

9

means I have to look at every trademark application, I

And sure enough, it is

And then

And what he's worried about is that that

10

have to give my all the first time, and if I don't, I'm

11

stuck.

12

That's true, isn't it?

MR. JAY:

Well, it is true that whichever

13

forum he goes to first, whether it's the trademark board

14

or a court considering infringement, yes, he's supposed

15

to give his all the first time because the judgment can

16

be preclusive in future litigation.

17

But ­­ and I think that the reasons to pay

18

attention to registration in the circumstances that you

19

gave are significant ones, because if he just lets Louis

20

Vuitton sit there in the market with a registration for

21

5 years, and Louis Vuitton's mark becomes incontestable

22

then he has to face the consequences of that.

23

So I think that people who are already in

24

the ­­ in the market and see a junior mark holder coming

25

in and seeking registration, they have reasons to oppose

3

has to go to the board who doesn't want to, because you

4

always have the option of pursuing the cancellation

relief or getting a mark cancelled or getting your mark

6

registered.

7

with an infringement action.

But if they don't want to go to the
No one ever

You can do that in district court coupled

8

So if you are the senior mark holder, sue

9

for infringement and you'll have a jury trial, right.

10

If you win, then you can get the opposing mark

11

cancelled, provided that it hasn't become uncontestable.

12

That, I think, is a large part of our answer

13

to the other side's argument about the jury trial right,

14

that there's always the option to sue.

15

always the option to get Article III review of a

16

judgment of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.

17

board is just deciding a question of public right.

18

not trenching on the ­­ the role of Article III judges.

19

But once its renders such a judgment, as a matter of

20

preclusion law, as a matter of statutory text, its

21

judgment is preclusive because it's deciding the same

22

issue and under this Court's decision in Astoria v.

23

Solimino.

yourself geographically; C, choose a different mark.

15

And I think that the board's proceedings may well be

16

more conducive to that than litigation.

17

there are, I think, fewer than 200 board cases that go

18

to final judgment each year in contested proceedings.

19

I'm not sure how many trademark cases actually go to

20

final judgment.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in the ­­

When you say "to final

22

judgment," you mean final judgment before the board or

23

file judgment after review in the courts?

24
25

MR. JAY:

I mean final judgment before the

board, Justice Kennedy.

The number of litigants that

Alderson Reporting Company

actually go on and seek review, as you would expect, is

2

smaller.

3

seek review, either before the Federal circuit under the

4

APA standard of review or in district court.

go to district court, you can, if you choose, introduce

6

new evidence.

7

But there's certainly always the option to

And if you

You have alternatively

8

argued in your brief for some form of deference if we're

9

not going to call it preclusive.

It seemed to me that

10

that was addressing an issue you didn't seek cert on,

11

which was whether the court below erred in not

12

permitting the mark holder to ­­ to tell the jury that

13

the board had found a similarity and confusion.

In what field of law do we say,

20

let me be clear.

21

preclusion.

22

deference is if preclusion doesn't apply because, even

23

though it's the same issue, for some reason the

24

Trademark Board can't render a preclusive judgment, and

25

we think that that issue is what's not properly been

Our primary position is, of course,

And the only reason that we would get into

stage.

3

But if you got into that, we think that what

4

you would look ­­ and this is why we put question 2 in

5

our cert petition and the Court granted both questions,

6

what you would look to, I think ­­ or, for example, the

arbitration cases like Alexander v. Gardner­Denver, in

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the fact that

Were those in days before

you could get a jury trial in a Title VII case?
MR. JAY:

The Court, I believe, had not held

21

that at that point, Justice Ginsburg.

22

that's ­­ I think that's correct.

23

that the jury question has any effect on this because,

24

you know, for example, there's ­­ there's a jury right

25

in a 1983 case, there's a jury right in an ADEA case.

So I think

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What disturbed the Eighth

Circuit on that point was that the jury would be

3

powerfully confused; it has enough to deal with what the

4

charge in the infringement case is.

5

MR. JAY:

It ­­ it certainly would require

6

an explanation of what went on, but I think that that

would have been better than instructing the jury, as was

done here, that the two proceedings involved completely

different issues and that the jury should not give it

10

any weight at all.

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

17

SUPPORTING PETITIONER

18
19

Thank you, counsel.

MR. BASH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

Respondent has not identified any material

21

difference between the issue decided by the board and

22

the issue ­­ and what was at issue in the infringement

23

case.

24
25

For that reason ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Bash, that's a very much

stronger statement than your briefs make.

Alderson Reporting Company

So your

Official

18
1

briefs go likely and probably and this and that.

2

so are all of your likely's and probably's no longer

3

true?

4

MR. BASH:

And ­­

Well, the likely's or probably's

5

were an opening for Respondent to identify a material

6

difference between the suit and the board proceeding.

7

The reason we did that is because we were framing the

8

standard in a slightly different way than it was

9

proposed below.

And we think if the normal course of

10

proceedings had happened, Petitioner would have asked

11

for summary judgment and then Respondent should have

12

come forward and identified some difference in the goods

13

or marks or channels of trade, and then the district

14

court and potentially the jury could have considered

15

whether that difference was material.

16

The issues weren't teed up like that in

17

the courts below, so we wanted to give Respondent a fair

18

opportunity to identify a difference between what

19

happened in the board and what happened before

20

the court, and Respondent has not identified any

21

difference that we would consider material under our

22

standard.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. BASH:

So get to the stuff you

So the only difference that

6

Respondent has identified is what we would characterize

7

as a different mark, "Sealtite Building Fasteners"

8

versus "Sealtite."

9

demonstrated that "Sealtite Building Fasteners" wasn't

Now, I think Petitioner has

10

even really at issue in the trial, but even putting

11

aside that factual distinction, the ordinary rule is

12

just adding a generic term like "building fasteners"

13

can't make the difference in a preclusion analysis.

14

I think the way it should have worked had everything

15

gone sort of the correct way is that Petitioner would

16

have said, hey, the board proceeding gets issue

17

preclusion in this infringement suit.

18

the word "Sealtite," which is, by the way, what the jury

19

was instructed, not "Sealtite Building Fasteners."

20

Respondent then could have come forward and said, well,

21

actually, the mark's a little different now.

22

"Sealtite Building Fasteners" or "Sealtite Screws" or

23

"Sealtite Nails."

24
25

So

I'm suing about

And at the summary judgment stage, the
district court would have had to make a judgment about

standard in issue preclusion where the question arises

5

whether the second tribunal is considering a

6

fundamentally different issue than the first tribunal.

7

I think in Montana v. United States, when this Court

8

talked about the changed circumstances principle, it

9

averted to that principle.

10

And the material standard is
It's the ordinary

And it really has to be that way.

I mean,

11

just imagine the court­to­court scenario, infringement

court at time one and then infringement court at time

13

14

the mark "Sealtite" infringes in an infringement court,

15

Respondent couldn't then just add "Fasteners" and start

16

the suit all over again and then once Respondent ­­

Surely, if Petitioner had obtained a judgment that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, how do you respond

18

to the question I asked Mr. Jay, that is, as the

19

Restatement of Judgments says, if one aspect of the

20

first proceeding is to assure expeditiousness, then

21

confining the stakes to that issue of registration makes

22

sense so that the parties will not be induced to dispute

23

the administrative proceeding in anticipation of its

24

effect on another proceeding.

25

MR. BASH:

Justice Ginsburg, I think that's

MR. BASH:

There is ­­ there's no live

18

understood as the sort of difference between an

19

administrative tribunal and a judicial proceeding that

20

could effectively mean that there wasn't a full and fair

21

opportunity to litigate the question.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

One of the amicus briefs

23

suggests that this is very, very much less expensive, so

24

that it's like 10 percent of the cost of an infringement

25

suit.

Why is that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

MR. BASH:

Because in an infringement suit,

2

the most discovery­intensive aspects, I think, are often

3

damages and injunctive relief.

4

really have to look at the other side's books to know

5

how many of these products did you sell, what were your

6

profits, and so forth.

7

suit where damages or injunctive relief is at issue, it

8

could be, you know, four times the cost for discovery

9

purposes of this kind of suit.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In other words, you

I ­­ I find it hard to

believe that this board proceeding is ­­ is intended

up to the district court and start all over again de

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Thank you, Justice Scalia.

I

don't understand that.
MR. BASH:

I was going to follow on to my

19

answer to Justice Ginsburg by making that point.

20

mean, you have a full de novo trial in district court if

21

you want it, and that doesn't reflect the sort of

22

proceeding that Congress would have thought was summary

23

in nature.

24

higher­level point about the nature of the proceedings,

14

the board continuously says that they should not be like

15

16

I guess the argument is, well, in light of that

17

procedural difference, he can't call all his witnesses,

18

he can't test the consumer experts of the other side who

19

say that there is no confusion, and he can't present his

20

very credible expert who will come up and say, I

21

up.

23
24

If the defendant was sued based on

infringement court would say a survey that has design

12

elements ­­ color, font, and so forth ­­ when you're

13

asserting the right to use this word in any context,

14

that sort of survey is not going to be as probative as a

15

survey that just uses the word, since you're seeking the

16

right to just use the word.

22

MR. BASH:

marks being used in commerce and whether the marks used

in commerce would confuse people.

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Congress designed the Trademark Registry as

a relatively low­cost signaling mechanism to provide

MR. KATYAL:

think you could endorse the type of statutory gymnastics

8

that my friend from the government does to say, hey,

9

these are the same inquiry.

But at the end of the day,

10

that is against everything this Court's precedents

11

teach, which is that when Congress uses different

statutory formulations in different provisions, they are

13

deemed to mean different things.

14

friend from the government concluded by saying, well,

you know the statute defines confusing resemblance ­­

resemblance and so, therefore, the inquiries are somehow

the same.

We have two answers to that.

19

The first is as Justice Ginsburg was saying earlier when

20

the weight of the proceedings has differences at stake,

21

then preclusion shouldn't apply.

22

to deal with that, is that if the mark itself claims

23

some sort of limited sale, limited ­­ limited category

MR. KATYAL:

That is why ­­ that our view is

that even if evidence is introduced at the district

fundamental problem.

because the question being asked is different as well as

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

could prevail on the idea that when the ­­ when the uses

different ways.

5

appropriate case.

6

Congress has known that.

That's the way

There isn't going to

It's going to happen.

The question then is:

Do you want a

7

litigant like Hargis to be stuck with a limited record

8

with limited evidence on a limited question,

9

particularly when, as I was saying to Justice Scalia,

10

the registration question that's being determined either

11

in the district court or in the TTAB is generally a

12

broader one.

13

easier to find likelihood of confusion based on that

14

paper mark than you can in actuality.

15

It's about the paper mark.

And there's

And so someone like Hargis in which you've

16

had a jury trial finding, look, no infringement, indeed

17

they had to ­­ the evidence was so weak on likely to

18

confusion that they had to manufacture some of it, those

19

types of rulings will never be able to happen because of

20

an administrative process, a stripped down process that

21

didn't ask the right question at the end of the day,

22

which is, is the use of the product, looking at the

23

stylization, looking at the way it's done in practice,

24

looking at the customer sophistication and the like, is

25

that use actually causing confusion?

Alderson Reporting Company

This case is a perfect illustration of why

2

you wouldn't want to have a preclusion rule in practice

3

because there's no infringement at bottom line here when

4

the product's actual use is being decided.

5

you can find a likelihood of confusion is by looking to

6

something more abstract, the resemblance and the

7

similarity of the goods alone, only the goods, not the

8

way in which the goods are actually being manufactured

9

and being sold.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The only way

Well, Mr. Katyal, I'm just

11

looking here at the TTAB's analysis and it seems to me

12

it's loaded with stuff about use.

13

sophisticated fasteners are primarily used in sealing

14

applications while Hargis's products are the next step

15

up from a nail and are not made for sealing."

16

MR. KATYAL:

It says, "B&B's

Justice Kagan, there's no doubt

17

that they recite that as part of the facts, but at page

18

70, they say the determinative factor here is the

19

similarity of the goods and not the similarity of the

20

goods in the actual marketplace because as the district

21

court found, these goods actually don't compete in the

22

marketplace whatsoever.

23

Sure, some evidence is going to come in at

the front end.
