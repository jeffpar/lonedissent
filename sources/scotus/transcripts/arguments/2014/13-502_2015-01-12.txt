ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. CORTMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The town's code discriminates on its face by

treating certain signs differently based solely on what

feet, may be unlimited in number, and may be placed in

15

the right­of­way of the entire town for five months

16

before the election; but the church's signs can only be

17

one­fifth of that side ­­ size, only placed in the dark

18

of night, the night before the church service.

For example, political signs may be 32 square

19

While the church's signs with directional

20

content are only allowed up for 14 hours, other signs

21

with directional content are allowed up for much longer.

22

For example, builders' directional signs to home sales

23

events are allowed up to be the entire ­­ are allowed up

24

the entire weekend, and homeowners' association event

MR. CORTMAN:

Well, but it's not allowed on

14

the right­of­way, and so that's a major factor in this

15

case because political signs are allowed on the

16

right­of­way, and so the treatment that we're seeking is

17

merely equal treatment under the First Amendment.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The same treatment as

political signs, then, is that ­­
MR. CORTMAN:

The ­­ the same treatment as

21

political signs that are allowed up in the right­of­way,

22

that's right.

23

And ideological signs, interestingly enough,

24

are still based into their own content category, but

25

they are not allowed on the right­of­way, yet they are

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you ­­ are you

seeking unlimited placement?
MR. CORTMAN:

We are not.

We're seeking

5

placement that any other temporary signs get, which is

6

the category that we're talking about.

7

And, in fact, the ­­ the city, the town here

8

has freedom to regulate the amount of time signs can go

9

up, the size of the signs, the number of the signs.

All

10

our argument is, is that they do it across the board and

11

not treat signs differently based on their content.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your ­­ your

13

argument does not turn on the fact that it's a church's

sign, does it?

15

the same if this is a temporary sign about where the

16

soccer game was going to be?

14

First Amendment.

15

what the town does here, it's valuing speech, and I

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you think directional

signs is a valid category?
MR. CORTMAN:

The reason I don't think it is

10

is because here, the direction is part of the invitation

11

to come and worship or part of the invitation to come to

12

a different event.

13

addition to the ideological speech, the invitation to

14

come in and worship.

15

different category of directional, it's important to the

16

speech of the church, inviting the community and saying

17

come worship with us, and here is where we are located.

18

So the directional part of it is in

And so although it appears to be a

And what's interesting about that, if the

19

church, for example, says we're meeting now at a senior

20

living center, that is considered to be a directional

21

sign because the definition is a sign that is intended

22

to invite and direct someone to your service, that would

23

then be banned in the right­of­way.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I guess you see the

concern, if an affluent person wants to celebrate a

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

birthday, he can put "Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" as

2

many places as a political sign, and as for long.

3

MR. CORTMAN:

Well, I think one of the

4

issues is if the government has decided that its

5

interest ­­ which, by the way, is what drives this, the

6

interest in safety and aesthetics, which is the two

7

interests the government proposes.

8

already been deemed to be less important than speech,

9

then I think speech should be allowed.

10

If those have

But ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your answer to the

11

question is "Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" can have as

12

many signs and for as long as the political campaign.

13
14
15

MR. CORTMAN:
right.

I think ­­ I think that is

And I ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That has ­­ that has to

16

be ­­ seem to me ­­ what about historical marker, the

17

birthplace of James Madison or whatever?

18

MR. CORTMAN:

I think the answer to that is

19

the government is free to put up that marker without

20

any ­­

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no, it's privately ­­

privately owned.
MR. CORTMAN:

Well, I think if it's ­­ if

24

it's allowing private speech, then we engage in the

25

problem of valuing.

For example, in that case, we think

10
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that marker is more important than someone else's

2

speech.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So again, under your view,

4

"Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" and "Save your soul" and

5

"Birthplace of James Madison" can all be up for the same

6

length of time, same size.

7

MR. CORTMAN:

I think it can, because

8

otherwise I think we have a problem with content­based

9

discrimination ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about permanent signs?

11

I assume that what you say about temporary signs would

apply equally to permanent signs, wouldn't it?

MR. CORTMAN:

It would, but in a different

category.

15

17

MR. CORTMAN:

I think has made clear if you have, for example,

How do you create your

6

temporary category without reading the sign?

7

so there is some force, the counterargument that what is

8

being regulated here is not the content but the function

9

of the sign.

And

So how do you get around that argument?

10

Because you've already created a category that requires

11

you to read the sign.

12

MR. CORTMAN:

I don't think it does, and the

13

reason the way the temporary sign is defined here is

14

merely a sign that's both

16

sign; that's why we think that category is content

neutral, because as long as it's a temporary sign, it

doesn't matter what the sign says.

3

MR. CORTMAN:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's right.
It seems to me that

5

you are trying to find a, I don't know, a difficult way

6

to deal with an issue that could be readily addressed

7

just by seeing if the sign is for a limited event.

8

other words, what if somebody ­­ every time ­­ you know,

9

the stake in the ground at least could last for three

In

10

weeks, so every three weeks, they come along and stick

11

the stake back in the ground.

12

way they can distinguish is by looking at whether it has

13

a stake in the ground or whether it's in concrete, and

14

yet that seems to me that doesn't help the ­­ that

15

doesn't answer the city's legitimate concern.

16

MR. CORTMAN:

You are saying the only

But I think what is important

17

here is that

18

agreed that an election is an event, and so we have an

19

election that's an event, but yet that single event sign

20

can be up for five months, and yet we have an event

21

where that single event can only be up overnight.

22

so it's already made that determination that it would

23

allow those types of signs for what I think is a

24

comparable use, a single event to a single event.

25

The other thing I would say is if you allow

if the city, the town has already

14
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

signs to be up for one single event for five months,

2

certainly there should be some way to say, well, if we

3

have a recurring event as we do here, certainly the sign

4

should be allowed up at least equal to the same time,

5

and ­­

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I mean, to say that

7

an election is a single event in the same way as a

8

football game, a cookout, a basketball championship,

9

it's ­­ it seems to me is a very difficult thing for

10

this Court to have to decide.

11

political campaign is a dynamic that goes on for some

12

weeks that the signs initiate a discussion. Now I can see

13

where you can say the religious sign does or at least

14

should initiate the same discussion of ­­ on issues that

15

are certainly of the same importance, if not more.

16

MR. CORTMAN:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's just not ­­ a

Certainly ­­
But it seems to me you are

18

forcing us into making a very wooden distinction that

could result in a proliferation of signs for birthday

20

parties or for every conceivable event that could be up

21

for five months.

22

MR. CORTMAN:

But I think the problem is

23

there ­­ there already is that here, because we have an

24

unlimited number of political signs.

25

streets are already littered in an unlimited number of

12

define that concept?

date to be placed on the sign both for when the sign is

is.

is, as we look through their brief, there are

19

innumerable ways for the Court ­­ excuse me ­­ for the

21

And all my point

There is no reason to look at the content of

the sign, and the reason is the content of the sign

affects the ­­ the government interest of safety and

So the way to deal with clutter is an easy

rule, and, in fact, even the town concedes that the

that the majority of the circuits now use in the sign

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

For the towns it might be.

12

What about there are vast areas of the country where

13

there is scenery and people want to keep the scenery the

14

same, and they don't want signs at all, but they don't

15

want to say no signs because someone who wants to put up

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN.

3

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

4

SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY

5
6

MR. FEIGIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

7

We agree with Petitioners that Respondents'

8

ordinance here is unconstitutional, but we think that a

9

context­specific intermediate scrutiny approach should

10

apply in evaluating speech­permissive exceptions to a

11

sign ordinance where those exceptions are based on the

12

same longstanding traditional rationales that justify

13

the sign ordinance as a whole.

14

A wooden application of strict scrutiny in

15

this context would suggest that it's presumptively

16

unconstitutional, for example, for a town to limit signs

17

on public property but have an exception if you want to

18

paint your street number on your curb.

19

Now, that doesn't make a great deal of

20

practical sense, and that's not an example I just made

21

up.

22

upheld, albeit without specifically addressing this

23

particular issue, in Taxpayers for Vincent.

24
25

That's essentially the ordinance that this Court

On a theoretical level, the normal reasons
for deep judicial skepticism of exceptions to a

regulation of speech don't apply in the context of that

2

street address exception, exceptions for danger or

3

safety signs, or other types of exceptions that track

4

the normal safety and nonproliferation rationales for a

5

sign regulation.

6

any inference that the government is attempting to favor

7

one viewpoint or another, that it's trying to limit the

8

set of ideas that are going to come into the public

9

marketplace, or that it doesn't truly believe in the

Those kinds of exceptions don't create

10

safety and nonproliferation rationales that underlie the

11

sign regulation as a whole.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I mean, you ­­

13

you obviously know the difficulty with that, which is

14

how does the government decide when there should be an

15

exception or how does a court decide when there should

16

be an exception and when there shouldn't be?

17

understood the whole point of the strict scrutiny for

18

content­based restrictions is to find out which are the

19

types of speech or the particular types of regulation

20

that should be given an exception, rather than starting

21

with saying, well, you don't apply this scrutiny because

22

there ought to be an exception.

23

MR. FEIGIN:

I mean, I

Well, I think the main problem

24

with strict scrutiny in this context is it sends a

25

signal to legislatures that they are on safer ground if

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they enact a broad and undifferentiated restriction on

2

signs than if they try to tailor it only to those types

3

of signs that actually cause the problem that they are

4

trying to prevent.

5

And I think that the way the Court can

6

manage the situation is to see whether, under

7

intermediate scrutiny, there really are safety and­or

8

nonproliferation rationales that track onto whatever

9

exception is being drawn.

10

So if we could use, for example, Justice

11

Sotomayor's example of the "For Sale" signs.

12

might permissibly have an ordinance that limits the

13

number of signs you can have on your lawn to two, two

14

signs of any type; but it might also say, you know,

15

we're not going to count "for Sale" signs against your

16

quota of two and the reason is that "For Sale" signs are

17

only up on a very small percentage of properties at any

18

given of time, they are up for a very limited purpose

19

when the property is for sale, and they go down once the

20

sale is consummated.

7

that is going to foreclose experimentation and local

solutions to local problems.

9

Let me give you another example of a town

apply that sign restriction to safety signs like

are going to apply strict scrutiny to those kinds of

exceptions, they are probably not going to pass muster

would cause safety problems ­­

wants.

So you're ­­ you're saying

6

every private individual has to have a big sign,

7

"Children At Play," right?

8
9

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, I don't want to resist

too hard the idea that the Government can put up any

10

signs it wants, but I think the reason we think the

11

Government could put up the signs here is not because

12

the Government can say that it can speak on certain

13

topics and private citizens can't, but because of the

14

nature of the signs that are being put up, which means

15

that some work has to be done here by the fact that the

16

types of signs I described are safety signs.

17

Now, if we’re going to subject

that kind of

18

exception to strict scrutiny, it turns out there's actually

19

a fairly robust empirical debate about whether "Children

20

At Play" signs or "Hidden Driveway Ahead" signs actually

21

do enhance safety.

22

one­size­fits­all conclusion about whether the state of

the Court can deal with the competing interests in this

definition of content­based and content­neutral, which I

19

can address in a second, but by focusing more on the

bottom­line question of whether this is an appropriate

21

case for the application of strict scrutiny or

22

intermediate scrutiny.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When you use those labels

24

in the context of the First Amendment, do they mean the

25

29
Alderson Reporting Company

That is,

Official

1

intermediate scrutiny is a pretty tough standard in

2

equal protection.

3

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, I think there are a

4

couple of flavors of intermediate scrutiny, both under

5

the Constitution at large and under the First Amendment

6

in particular.

7

something more like a reasonable fit test, which we

8

think would give municipalities enough room to draw the

9

kinds of distinctions that I think they reasonably

I think here we would be urging

10

should be able to make between painting your street

11

number on your curb so people can more easily find your

12

house and restrictions on, you know, particular types of

13

speech that are much more likely to be motivated by

14

disagreement with that speech.

15

We do think that intermediate scrutiny has a

16

fair amount of teeth in the circumstance, I mean, and

17

we're putting our money where our mouth is because we

18

think that the particular ordinance at issue here fails

19

intermediate scrutiny.

20

But intermediate scrutiny would give

21

municipalities enough room to draw these kinds of

22

distinctions and to draw, in particular, the kinds of

23

distinctions that are drawn in the Highway

24

Is that a distinction that the First
Amendment permits?
MR. FEIGIN:

I think a court might be

reasonably fairly skeptical of that kind of distinction.

The problem with applying strict scrutiny in

believe, the opposite effect.

13

because towns, cities will enact one size fits all.

14

order to do that, as Petitioner's counsel indicated,

15

there need to be limitations on the number of signs, on

17

you.

You can make that argument
I don't know where it gets

Suppose that the question is, whether the town is

2

town ­­ the town council says, well, you know, we would

3

like to have people be able to speak on subjects that we

to speak.

So we have the

8

So you can make exactly that same argument in lots

9

of other contexts where I don't think the distinction

10
11

could be justified.

Isn't that right?

MR. SAVRIN:

I think there is a difference,

12

Justice Alito, in signs as opposed to speech because

13

signs do take up physical space.

14

uses of land, and they perform different functions.

15

They displace other

One thing that we would like to emphasize in

16

this case is that the temporary directional sign

17

provision is limited to in signs that are intended to

18

guide travelers along a route from Point A to Point B.

19

If they have expressive content on them, then they are

20

no longer a directional sign but are then an expressive

21

sign; and there is a different provision that applies

22

for that.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if the sign here said,

24

"We welcome you to attend our church service," and then

25

it says on the bottom, meeting place, and it specifies

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the meeting place, but the message is "we welcome you to

2

attend our service," that's ideological?

3

MR. SAVRIN:

That is ideological.

That

4

would not be a directional sign because it's not

5

directing travelers along ­­ along the route to that

6

location.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it says also "welcome

8

you to attend our church service, it will be held at."

9

So it's giving the direction, but it's also expressing

10
11

the message that everyone is welcome to come worship.
MR. SAVRIN:

I believe the way that this

12

code has been interpreted, Justice Ginsburg, is that

13

that would not be a directional sign because it's not

14

saying turn right, turn left, go straight a few miles.

15

It's not giving directions about how to get there.

16

So I believe that that type of sign would be

17

permitted under this ordinance as an ideological sign

18

and would not be limited to the terms of the temporary

19

directional.

MR. SAVRIN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

You say, well,

Yes.
First question would be:

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Is there some category that you don't allow to put up

2

signs?

3

Answer, no.

Everybody can put up signs.

So what about applying strict scrutiny to

4

that?

5

what the sign says, you have to have an awfully good

6

reason, if your decision is you can't put up one at all.

7

Next, you put them up, but you have all content ­­ all

8

kinds of distinctions how, how long, et cetera.

9

If you are going to distinguish on the basis of

Now, in respect to that, maybe you should

have more leeway, leeway depending upon the purpose of

11

the sign.

12

13

or something.

14

leeway there.

15

So if, for example, it's about an open air,

I mean, you know, you maybe have more

But still they're saying you would flunk

16

even that test here because there isn't really a very

17

good reason at all in this case for making the sign

18

smaller or for putting it there for such a short time.

19

Now, how do you react ­­ there are three

20

parts:

21

can't put it up at all, sometimes called strict

22

scrutiny; two, somewhat more lenient if it gets up, but

23

you are trying to distinguish among how and under what

24

circumstances, how long; and then three, do you even

satisfy that one?

One, very tough if you are going to say you

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, okay.

Well, with respect

3

to the first one, the interest most of the times in sign

5

aesthetics and safety.

6

don't believe that that would meet the definition of a

7

8

presumptively, and conclusively unconstitutional if the

9

strict scrutiny is applied and that's the ­­ there is no

compelling interest.
With respect to the interests at stake here,

12

we again believe that directional signs are functionally

13

different from an ideological sign or even from a

14

political sign, that the directional signs do not need

15

to be larger and also that there are more of them.

16

so if there are more of them, the trade­off is ­­ at

17

least the legislature in this town has decided the

18

trade­off is that they need to be smaller because they

But even with the State statute, the ­­ if

12

the State has decided that its interest in free speech

in political signs outweighs the interest in safety and

aesthetics, then the town should basically adopt an

15

ordinance that abides by that.

16

that is to treat it as a constitutional floor.

17

State has decided that we're going to allow political

18

signs up for that period of time ­­ and by the way, the

statue doesn't mention other signs.

So it's not a

restriction like this town code is.

All it says is,

And so the

response by the town is, okay, if that's the case and

the State has decided that political signs outweigh our

interests in safety and aesthetics, the way we deal with

that is treating other similar signs the same.

5

I think, a couple other points, the noise

ordinance is a perfect example, whether it's the that

side case or the Kobachs case.

akin to allowing, for example, political speech to be

much louder in decibels and for longer periods of time,

This ordinance would be

12

And quickly, if I may address the safety and

13

beautification interests, they are certainly important

14

interests.

15

Carey v. Brown, for example, and Discovery Network, the

16

distinctions, the content­based distinctions in the code

17

bear no relationship to the government interest.

18

distinctions don't advance those interests.
