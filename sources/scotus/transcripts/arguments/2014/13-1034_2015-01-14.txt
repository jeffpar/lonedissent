MR. LARAMORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The initial goal of this appeal was to

reverse a single Board of Immigration Appeals decision

12

that changed the removability analysis for drug

13

paraphernalia convictions.

14

longstanding practice that Congress had ratified.

It abandoned the

15

We wanted to reinstate the rule that still

16

applies in all other drug deportation decisions which

17

looks at the facts that must be established by a

18

conviction and at the record of conviction, when that's

19

appropriate, under this Court's precedents

20

and Descamps.

21

thousands of drug deportations each year, but not for

22

someone convicted of possessing a sock.

23

in Moncrieffe

That methodology has led to tens of

Now, the government has argued that this

24

wrongheaded BIA paraphernalia decision should be

25

expanded to all drug convictions.

Alderson Reporting Company

The government wants

Official

any drug conviction to be a deportable offense, even if

2

it's clearly for a non­Federal drug.

3

This Court should reject the government's

position and the BIA's position and adhere to the

5

time­tested approach that the statute ­­ to the ­­ to

MR. LARAMORE:

6

sentence, though, everything in that whole phrase,

all modifies "alien."

The whole phrase has to be taken

10

together and read together to modify what alien is

11

deportable.

And ­­ and the pure grammar does ­­ is not

13

sufficient to determine what Congress meant when it

14

enacted that text.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you ­­ if you ­­ I

If you're claiming that,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, that's lovely, but

8

it doesn't get you around the question that Justice

Alito asked, what is the law?

10

MR. LARAMORE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

May I make a suggestion?

Certainly, Justice Scalia.
Perhaps the law ­­ if you

12

ask somebody what law did Mellouli violate here, it

13

would be perfectly natural to respond by reciting one ­­

14

the elements of the law that he violated.

2

MR. LARAMORE:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. LARAMORE:

Yes.

And that's ­­

Is that a good suggestion?

Yes, your Honor.

And ­­ and

6

in our view that's precisely the work that's done in the

7

statute by the word "conviction" and its association

8

with the categorical approach.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

MR. LARAMORE:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Laramore ­­
That's the framework.
­­ that is one way of

12

looking at it, but might I suggest that you gave in a

13

little bit too fast to Justice Alito that the phrase

14

"relating to a controlled substance" has to modify

15

"law."

16

phrase like that would modify the last noun ­­

It's ­­ it's very true that usually in grammar a

talking about violation, because here is the way it

reads.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Other ­­ otherwise, that,

It could modify that.

So what would the violation be?

It's an awkward

So what then happens if the

substance, but the conviction is under a law that does

not relate to a Federally controlled substance?

7

the alien, for example, is convicted of burglarizing a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

19

MR. LARAMORE:

It's ­­ the

I certainly didn't mean to

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

A few moments ago, I

understood you to concede when Justice Ginsburg asked

2

the State law and the Federal law, your client would be

3

deportable.

4

MR. LARAMORE:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
So the fact that

there's a ­­ it's a drug paraphernalia conviction has

7

nothing to do with the ­­ the issue before us?

8
9

MR. LARAMORE:

Well, the um ­­ the ­­ the

10

requires that the conduct be associated with a

11

controlled ­­ a Kansas controlled substance.

12

Kansas controlled substance list is the same as the

13

Section 802 list, and then the conviction satisfies the

14

statute.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the

So, so long as the

16

drug offense is related to, then the paraphernalia

19

MR. LARAMORE:

So it doesn't make any

I ­­ I think I understand

It would not, be because the

Federal statute says that ­­ I don't have the language

in my head, but the concept is that to be paraphernalia

15

it ­­ its usual purpose has to be to facilitate drug

paraphernalia does.

And the Kansas definition is far

18

broader than that.

It's really any object that can be

19

used to store or facilitate storage of or facilitate use

20

of a controlled substance.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's why I

would have thought your answers to me would have been

And ­­ and our

analysis, again, as I point to that lengthy appendix, is

18

that the great majority of State statutes that cover the

19

primary drug activities ­­ manufacturing, sale, and

20

21

subject to the modified categorical approach.

5

we're doing here is, is I'm making this argument about

6

the modified categorical approach to counter the

8

perspective would cut back on the number of people who

9

could be deported for drug violations and ­­ and that's

10

But ­­ but the

just not so.

11

In fact, the Board of Immigration Appeals

12

has been applying the law the way we say it should be

13

applied for ­­ for all nonparaphernalia offenses for

14

decades, and it always is deporting, if you look at

15

their own statistics, 30,000, 35,000 people a year for

16

drug offenses.

17

So it's not ­­ the approach that we are

18

advocating here, that has been used for many years, is

19

not something that brings a halt to drug deportations.

20

Drug deportations have been happening all along in ­­

21

under ­­ under the approach that we suggest.

22

The government is really reading the law

23

here to encompass all drug convictions, and it would be

24

odd for that ­­ for that argument to be correct, given

25

that the statute says ­­ makes this reference to Section

You can't really reconcile that with the

reasons why Petitioner's drug paraphernalia conviction

The first is that Federal law allows the

every problem that's raised.

10

MS. KOVNER:

Let me give two responses.

One

11

is a textual one, and the second, I think, goes to your

12

practical point because I really think it's important

13

that it won't actually solve the practical problems

14

here.

15

As to the textual point, when Your Honor

16

talks about Taylor, I think it's important to note how

17

different the statute here is, which is unlike many

18

provisions that talk about being deportable or suffering

19

some other consequence for being convicted of a crime

20

relating to something, here it's talking about being

21

convicted of violating a law relating to something.

22

But I really want to address this practical

23

point, because, Your Honor, we think the result under

24

Petitioner's view is going to be a real patchwork in

25

terms of what conduct is removable depending on what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33

State you're in.

2

that it's not going to be possible to apply the modified

3

categorical approach to many drug statutes.

4

sometimes and it won't other times, and let me explain

5

why.

6

And the reason why, Justice Breyer, is

It will

For instance, here, under this statute, it

7

appears and under paraphernalia status generally, there

8

will typically not be a requirement of a finding or an

9

admission of what particular drug you intended to use

11

the ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if I understand the way

12

the law works, right, Ms. Kovner, that's ­­ that is true

13

of paraphernalia drugs, that they're indivisible with

14

respect to the controlled substance.

15

respect to most possession statutes or distribution

16

statutes or so forth.

17

distinction is because paraphernalia offenses are

18

generally extremely minor offenses; they're not

19

felonies.

20

misdemeanors that are meant to catch leftover things

21

that, you know, prosecutors plead to when they don't

22

really want to charge a more serious offense.

23

It's not true with

about that.

correct that this is going to be just paraphernalia

6

offenses and not any possession or distribution

7

offenses.

substances are on the Federal list, and there ­­ in some

all of those laws would be covered.

another colloquial meaning of controlled substance if

you look in, like, Black's Law Dictionary, which is just

we find most revealing here is that there are provisions

17

let me just mention the practical reason why we think

think that Congress chose it, which is that Congress

20

acted against the backdrop of State drug laws like

Kansas's, which ­­ which weren't States just enacting

random lists of substances as their controlled substances.

suggest that Congress believed that "relating to"

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.

But the question is,

4

when Congress makes a change like that, which we know is

a change for a particular reason because the list of

7

like yesterday's case; I don't know if you're familiar

with that ­­ but Congress makes a change for one reason,

suggests ­­ does not make any ­­ any suggestion that

this change is supposed to do something else and

something much bigger, which is extend this

deportability provision to controlled substances that

aren't part of the Federal list, and there's just no

reason to think that Congress did that in making this

change.

MS. KOVNER:

"relating to" language, which is very broad language, is

within the prior statute, and it's within the statute

one of those drugs that's not on the Federal list, just

for possession of that drug, and then we have another

conviction where that drug is inside a sock and it's for

drug paraphernalia.

14

So in the one case you would say not

removable, if it's just the substance itself, and in the

other case, because of the sock, it becomes removable?

17

MS. KOVNER:

Your Honor, I agree that I

18

think a strange feature of this case is that it involves

19

an item that's not usually thought of as drug

paraphernalia.

21

and the ones you see most often prosecuted in Kansas and

22

in other States are things like hyperdermic needles and

23

scales and substances that are used to mix with drugs

24

before sale, and I think it's easiest to see in that

case why the BIA's reasoning makes sense, which is,

I think the classic paraphernalia items

somebody possesses scales and distribution baggies and

cut in connection with a State­controlled substance ­­

20

say it's synthetic marijuana, an item that's not

Federally controlled at the time ­­ those are tools that

could be used in connection with a Federal drug as well.

crimes that ­­ that involve conduct that could

facilitate the distribution of one drug just as easily

nature of the substance doesn't ­­

I'd ask the Court to focus on ­­ on

7

Congress intended and knew about when it enacted this

8

version of the statute in 1996, and ­­ I'm sorry, 1986.

9

And she said that they knew about the Uniform Controlled

10

Substances Act and that may have had an influence,

11

although there's nothing that shows in the legislative

12

history that it did.

13

But Congress also knew about the categorical

14

approach when it put the word "convicted" into the

statute at that time.

16

approach and the modified categorical approach would be

17
