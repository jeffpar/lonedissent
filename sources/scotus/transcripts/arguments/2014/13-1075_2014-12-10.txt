ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH PRELOGAR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. PRELOGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There is good reason to believe that

12

Congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to

13

apply to the FTCA time bar, and I'd like to begin by

14

focusing on a few of the issues that arose last hour

15

that are particularly important to understanding

16

Congress's intent.

17

To start with the questions, Justice Scalia

18

and Justice Kagan, that you were asking at the end about

19

the nature of our rule and what separates this statute

20

from other statutes.

21

not urging a categorical rule about all pre­Irwin

22

statutes.

23

the FTCA that makes clear that Congress did not want

24

this particular enactment to be subject to equitable

25

tolling.

I want to be very clear:

We're

Here, we have statute­specific evidence about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And that's most clear, of course, from the

2

plain text and those 12 words, "Every claim against the

3

United States cognizable shall be forever barred

4

unless," that was lifted, Justice Scalia, as you said

5

verbatim from the Tucker Act context where it had been

6

repeatedly interpreted as a jurisdictional limit not

7

subject to tolling.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Ms. ­­
You don't doubt that

10

if ­­ if those words appeared in a statute that Congress

11

passed tomorrow, we would not interpret them as a

12

jurisdictional bar, would we?

13

MS. PRELOGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think it

14

would depend on whether there was an indication that

15

Congress was intending to incorporate those words from

16

the Tucker Act context.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought at least if a

18

statute passed tomorrow, we have the clear statement

19

rule that we have said ­­ we have told Congress if you

20

don't want to have any tolling, if you want this to be

21

jurisdictional, absolutely rigid, you say so, and of

22

course, Congress, it's your call.

23

to interpret a statute that doesn't make that clear

24

statement as jurisdiction.

25

MS. PRELOGAR:

But we're not going

But this Court has also

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

emphasized, Justice Ginsburg, that there are no magic

2

words that are required in this context.

3

Bowles v. Russell makes that particularly clear.

4

those words, "shall" and "notice of appeal," were

5

interpreted to have jurisdictional import.

6

here in this context ­­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I think
There,

And so to

Because this Court had

8

before ­­ had before said that provision about how much

9

time you have to appeal, that that was jurisdictional.

10

And I thought the Court's position was we decided it

11

once, and we're going to stick with it.

But if we

12

haven't decided it, then we look at it.

We look for a

13

clear statement.

14

MS. PRELOGAR:

It was not only Section 2107

15

in ­­ in that context, but also predecessor provisions

16

and other similar statutory requirements.

17

what the Court said in Henderson, when a long line of

18

this Court's decisions interpreting similar requirements

19

have said that those requirements are jurisdictional,

20

then we'll presume that Congress intended the same

21

meaning.

22

that jurisdictional label attached to it.

23

And that's

Here, we have the identical language that had

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's ­­

I don't ­­ I don't quite

24

get the identical language because "shall be barred," I

25

mean, that's common to a lot of statute of limitations.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

You're not suggesting that this would be different if it

2

just said "shall be barred" rather than "forever

3

barred," are you?

4

MS. PRELOGAR:

No.

We're saying that when

5

Congress lifted and incorporated word for word the

6

then­prevailing Tucker Act time bar, it clearly was

7

signaling an intent to incorporate the judicial

8

interpretations of that Tucker Act time bar.

9

And ­­ and, Justice Ginsburg, I ­­ I think

10

this is an important point about those early Tucker Act

11

cases.

12

Those were carefully considered decisions that attached

13

jurisdictional consequences to the ­­ the Tucker Act

14

time bar and said that it couldn't be waived.

15

subject to equitable tolling.

16

Those were not drive­by jurisdictional rulings.

It wasn't

So this wasn't a ­­ an argument that was

17

made in passing or something that the Court didn't

18

carefully consider.

decision in those cases that that language had

20

jurisdictional import.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Rather, the Court made a ­­ a

Ms. ­­ Ms. Prelogar, I'm

22

wondering what you think about Mr. Schnapper's analogy

23

to the private right of action cases, because it seems

24

to me very similar is that we're dealing in an area here

25

in which Congress doesn't generally say what it wants

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

with respect to some kind of procedural rule, maybe

2

because Congress doesn't usually think about it.

3

And we have one set of interpretative rules

4

to deal with that situation, and then those

5

interpretative rules basically switch off and we get the

6

opposite set of interpretative rules.

7

worked in the private right of action cases, we don't

8

look back and say, well, gosh, you were enacting this

9

statute in the world of Cort v. Ash, and you used

And the way it's

10

language that was identical to language that the Court

11

assumed gave rise to a private right of action there,

12

and so you get a private right of action, too.

13

We've not said that.

We've said, you know,

14

now we're in a different world and we're going to

15

require more of you than what the old ­­ than the old

16

language that gave rise to a private right of action

17

under Cort.

18

Why is this any different?

MS. PRELOGAR:

Justice Kagan, this Court has

19

said in the implied private right of action context that

20

you have to look at the contemporary legal context.

21

That was the Cannon case that we cite in our opening

22

brief and our reply brief.

23

v. Sandoval, made clear that ­­ that those holdings

24

hinged on the fact that Congress had acquiesced in the

25

decision that had prevailed at the governing time.

And this Court, in Alexander

­­ were those two cases

pre­ or ­­ that you just cited pre­ or post­Irwin?
MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, I was talking about the

private right of action cases, Justice Kennedy.

7

So with respect to statutes that ­­ that

8

predate Irwin, if you actually look at how Irwin has

9

fared and what the Irwin scorecard is, more often than

10

not, this Court has held that there isn't equitable

11

tolling in suits against the government.

12

considered that in five cases, and in four of them,

13

Brockamp, Beggerly, John R. Sand & Gravel, and Auburn

15

if it applies, is rebutted.

private right of action cases suggest rather strongly

MS. PRELOGAR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's true, Justice Scalia.

MS. PRELOGAR:

And it's an important point

5

here that there's no question that when Congress was

6

enacting the FTCA in 1946 and at all relevant times

7

thereafter, when it was making changes to this time bar,

8

it ­­ it did view that as a jurisdictional limit, and

9

the Court has never questioned that ­­ that historical ­­

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That was ­­ that was the

11

way everything was ­­ involving the government and

12

sovereign immunity was all, quote, "jurisdictional."

And then we said ­­ and if ­­ if Congress

14

made a statute, we said, well, we call that

jurisdictional.

21

mean it's jurisdictional.

22

MS. PRELOGAR:

Sure, you can have a ­­ you can have a

Justice Ginsburg, let me

23

respond to that by ­­ by taking a moment to emphasize

24

the history of the FTCA, because I think it's perfectly

25

clear that Congress at every turn, at every relevant

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

historical juncture, signaled its approval of the view

2

that this time bar was jurisdictional and could not be

3

tolled.

4

Congress has made significant changes to the

5

time bar four times:

6

at each of those times, Congress's words and actions

7

were either inconsistent with or unnecessary in light of

8

an equitable tolling doctrine.

9

In 1946, 1949, 1966 and 1988.

I could just tick through them.

And

In 1946,

10

Congress enacted the FTCA time bar and expressly

11

declined to include a tolling provision, even though it

12

had considered earlier bills that did include that kind

13

of tolling provision, which, as this Court has said, it

14

was a deliberate choice, rather than an inadvertent

15

omission.

16

In 1949 Congress was aware that there had

17

been individual cases of hardship and debated in one of

18

the hearings whether to create a reasonable cause

19

exception.

20

extend the deadline from 1 year to 2, which would have

21

been unnecessary if equitable tolling could take care of

22

the hardship.

23

Instead of doing so, Congress decided to

1966 is particularly important because at

24

that point there were 2 decades of experience with the

25

FTCA and every lower court to consider the issue had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

held that it was jurisdictional and not subject to

2

tolling.

3

repeatedly litigants came to it during that time period

4

and requested relief in the form of a private bill.

5

there, Justice Ginsburg, Congress did use that magic

6

word "jurisdictional."

7

relief through private laws that conferred jurisdiction

8

on district courts notwithstanding the time bar in

9

Section 2401(b).

Congress was aware of those decisions because

10

Finally, in the ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

Congress repeatedly

to our cases that use "jurisdiction."
MS. PRELOGAR:

cases, I would argue, when Congress then, in 1966,

reenacted the time bar without making any material

16

change.

17

interpreting the ­­ interpreting the time bar, and this

18

Court itself had just recently announced in Soriano that

19

the Tucker Act time bar and that language was

20

jurisdictional, not subject to tolling, and ­­ and Congress

21

acted in reliance on those decisions when it reenacted

22

the bar in '66.

23

Congress was aware that this is how courts were

Finally, in 1988, this was when Congress

24

enacted the Westfall Act.

At that point in time there

25

was a particular situation of hardship that had arisen

Alderson Reporting Company

12
1

when a claimant had sued a Federal employee and then the

2

United States was substituted as a defendant after the

3

time had run to present a claim to the administrative

4

agency.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Prelogar, I do think

6

that the ­­ the other side's account, at Mr. Schnapper's

7

account of the Westfall Act, the one that Congress was

8

intending to benefit was not the plaintiff, not the

9

injured plaintiff.

It was the Federal employee, because

10

until Westfall v. Erwin, the Federal employee was off

11

the hook.

12

Federal employee, you are going to be stuck, then

13

Congress passed a relief measure for the Federal

14

employee, not ­­ not the plaintiff.

15

He wasn't ­­ so then when this Court, said,

MS. PRELOGAR:

It's absolutely the case,

16

Justice Ginsburg, that that was the overall purpose of

17

the Westfall Act.

18

Section 2679(d)(5), which was the provision that gave

19

the claimant extra time to present a claim, 60 extra

20

days, if the claimant was out of luck because the time

21

of the statute had run by the time the United States was

22

substituted as a defendant.

23

Congress introduced in 1988 would have been entirely

24

unnecessary if Congress thought that courts could take

25

care of this on a case­by­case basis through equitable

But Congress included

And that exception that

So I think that the historical story here is
consistent and it's clear.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

At every turn ­­
You are equating

5

6

equitable tolling.

7

Ginsburg pointed out earlier, is much harder to get.

9

Equitable tolling, as Justice

MS. PRELOGAR:

That's absolutely true,

Justice Sotomayor, that it might be hard to get it in an

10

individual case.

11

and this again comes from the Tucker Act line of cases,

12

that Congress did view this as a ­­ a strict limit on

13

the waiver of sovereign immunity, and that Congress had

14

a right to suggest that it didn't even want to extend

15

that waiver one bit more.

16

But ­­ but I think that it's clear,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I ask a question?

17

You've both been arguing this as if your situations are

18

identical.

19

who says that ­­ who characterizes the administrative

20

claim process under the FTCA as claimant friendly?

21

But do you disagree with the Respondent here

MS. PRELOGAR:

Certainly that process is

22

claimant friendly, but when the Court has emphasized

23

that concern in other cases, and I'm thinking here of

24

Bowen and Henderson, the Court was looking specifically

25

at the time bar and whether it was claimant friendly.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

In Bowen, the time bar itself had a

2

provision that allowed the secretary to extend out the

3

limit for appealing a Social Security benefits denial,

4

and the secretary had interpreted that to encompass

5

principles of equity and fairness.

6

In Henderson, when the Court emphasized the

7

claimant­friendly nature of the procedural posture of

8

that case, the Court emphasized that there was no time

9

limit at all for a veteran to present his claim.

was claimant friendly.

21

How about 2401(a)?

MS. PRELOGAR:

The government's position is

22

that 2401(a) is jurisdictional, but I want to say at the

23

outset that each statute has to be interpreted on its

24

own terms ­­

4

MS. PRELOGAR:

2401(a) originated in the

5

Tucker Act itself in 1887 and, based on that Tucker Act

6

historical pedigree, we think that the same

7

interpretation of it that was longstanding would ­­

8

would govern here in this context.

tolling in a suit against the government.

3

the time Congress enacted Title VII in 1970­­ in 1972, it was

4

legislating against a backdrop where there wasn't a

5

uniform line of precedence from this Court saying that

6

every statute waiving sovereign immunity was ­­ was necessarily

7

subject to tolling.

9

And so, by

I think the important point here ­­ and this
comes from Honda v. Clark as well ­­ is an observation

10

about – about the mode of statutory interpretation that we're

11

urging.

12

that conclusion that there could be equitable tolling

13

notwithstanding the sovereign immunity considerations,

14

is because the statute in that case, the Trading with

15

the Enemy Act, had been expressly patterned after the

16

Federal Bankruptcy Act.

17

courts had interpreted the Bankruptcy Act to permit

18

equitable tolling.

19

Trading with the Enemy Act should be interpreted the

20

same way.

21

In Honda v. Clark the reason the Court reached

look at the statute and you look at what Congress

it, this was a strict condition on the waiver of

And the administrative process

The statute says it's

about settlement, it's about negotiations.

11

Breyer's point, you're usually unrepresented by counsel.

12

And the notion ­­ and DOJ says specifically in its

13

regulations that what is supposed to happen are,

14

"Informal discussions, negotiations and settlement

15

rather than any formal or structured process."

16

To Justice

The notion of applying a rigid, indeed

17

jurisdictional rule to that very informal process, flies

18

in the face of the whole informality that Congress set

19

up for the suit­initiating process.

20

Secondly ­­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And without need to say,

22

there were no prior cases talking about whether this was

23

equitable tolling under the Tucker Act because there was

24

no such thing.

That is exactly right.

They were never applied to the Tucker Act.

Now, all of the ­­ all of the criteria that

Title VII ­­ in Zipes this Court tells us that the

So that's the second point ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Rosenkranz, so I

15

understand you, are you arguing that tolling applies to

16

the presentment provision even though it doesn't apply

17

to other provisions?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor.

hold that?

24

under Irwin for reasons that I will explain in a little

25

bit.

What I'm arguing is tolling has

Alderson Reporting Company

26

But when Congress reenacts this in 1966, it

2

makes abundantly clear that that conclusion is correct.

3

Because now we've got this presentment requirement,

4

which I think refreshes congressional intent with

5

respect to what it was thinking on jurisdiction.

6

But ­­ but I will circle back to this in a

7

moment as I said, but I agree with everything Mr.

8

Schnapper said.

for the ­­

We have a fairly

language from another source, which I will also get to

presentment.

6

The third point I was going to make is that

7

as originally drafted, this presentment requirement was

9

was permissive.

It was in the original FTCA.

It

So with respect to repeals by

10

implication, what happens next is Congress makes it a

requirement.

12

Government's position then, as I understand it, is, when

13

Congress turned it in ­­ turned it from permissive to a

14

requirement, Congress also made that requirement both

15

jurisdictional and impervious to the age­old doctrine of

16

equitable tolling.

17

And the presumption then, or the

22

And that really is a version of the

points ­­

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rosenkranz, in that

9

regard, would you clarify what is the Government's ­­

10

what is your position in response to the Government's

11

rather strong answer to your suggestion that equity was

12

foreign to the claims court?

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, yes, Your Honor.

14

First, let me begin by saying that our basic position is

15

that ­­ that the presumption exists that Irwin was a sea

16

change in the law, that Irwin changes things as to every

17

other statute moving forward.

18

a series of differences between the Federal Tort Claims

19

Act and the Tucker Act, and this difference in forum was

20

one of them.

But we've also ticked off

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And I

don't think it calls into question McNeil v. U.S. at

first piece is, let's assume that McNeil was a

Our argument is not that this is a living

intent.

21

there is a sea change, that Soriano and all the cases

22

dating back on the Tucker Act adopted a vision of what

23

Congress must have intended that Irwin says is wrong.

24

That is not what Congress intends just because it waives

25

sovereign immunity.

Our argument is that Irwin made it clear that

And so ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I don't think

2

it can be regarded as such a sea change because the

3

basic principle is you're looking to legislative intent.

And he said, the ­­ the late Chief, that the realistic

5

assessment of legislative intent is likely to be found

Of course, you know, subject

So that doesn't seem to me to be ­­ the
whole point is we think this is how best define

10

legislative intent, and that I thought has always been

11

the rule.

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, that's always been

13

the rule, Your Honor, in the private context and the

14

government is now being put in the private context, but

15

that was not always the rule with respect to the

16

government and certainly not consistently because we

17

have Soriano.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But, I mean, that

19

was not a legislative intent.

20

think the presumption of legislative intent is ­­ is no

21

equitable tolling.

22

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

The view was not that we

Oh, Your Honor, I ­­ I beg

23

to differ.

24

this Court did not use phrases like "presumption."

25

what this Court did was to say Congress didn't say

As I read Kendall and Finn, they didn't ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official

39
1

anything about this, but it was legislating against a

2

backdrop of waiving sovereign immunity, and when

3

Congress waives sovereign immunity, we have to read

4

statutes in a particular way; we're going to read them

5

very strictly.

6

Irwin says, no, that's not how we're going

7

to read statutes, that the better way to read statutes

8

is to assume the opposite, that Congress did not intend

9

statutes of limitations to be jurisdictional.

And

10

sure ­­ and by the way, John R. Sands says, and I quote,

11

"It was" ­­ and I quote ­­ "a turn in the course of the

12

law," which now, quote, "places great weight upon the

13

equitable importance of treating the government like

14

other litigants and less weight on the special

15

governmental interest in protecting public funds."

16

Words that this Court, perhaps by accident, but ­­ but

17

almost took directly out of the Federal Tort Claims Act,

18

treating the government like it treats other parties.

19

So ­­ so Justice Scalia makes a powerful ­­

20

powerful point about a countervailing presumption.

21

it is not ­­ by which I mean it is another presumption,

22

but it is a ­­ it is an argument

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. PRELOGAR:

If I could just make three

points.

presentment requirement in particular, I want to be very

14

clear on this.

15

there was an optional administrative presentment

16

procedure, and this appears in our brief at page 9a.

17

This is the original text of the FTCA time bar, and it

18

uses the very same operative language with respect to

19

that administrative presentment option:

20

21

understood McNeil to be jurisdictional, and Congress, in

22

1988, when it enacted the Westfall Act specifically said

So I think it is clearly settled that

But the point that I was trying to make

5

about the 1966 reenactment is there, against that

6

consistent backdrop about what this language means, the

7

language that Congress had used, Congress, to set forth

8

a presentment requirement, used the same language once

9

again and ­­ and, therefore, intended it to have the

10
11

same meaning.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Mr. Rosenkranz

12

tells us that that language is pretty typical for your

13

ordinary, run­of­the­mill statute of limitations.

14

sounds pretty daunting, you know, forever barred, but

15

apparently that's the normal language that's used.

16

MS. PRELOGAR:

It

And it's absolutely the case,

17

Mr. Chief Justice, that it is not "forever barred"

18

itself that necessarily has magic import here.

19

Tucker Act analogy, the fact that Congress got this

20

language from the Tucker Act, and that in that context,

21

which was a parallel context, it had interpreted to be

22

jurisdictional which makes the difference here.

statute will have to be evaluated in light of not just

24

the text but its context and history.

again, the Chief Justice, "A continuing effort on our

Yet everything I've heard, not everything,

12

but many of the things I've heard say that this statute

is special because if we go into the history of it, if

we decide what the various other rules are that might

Now, how do we reconcile that view with the

If I understand Respondent, he would distinguish our

cases by saying that they were all rendered after this

Court's Tucker Act line of cases in 1906 and 1935.

11

Notably, that's before Congress enacted the FTCA.

12

it shows that Congress, when it was enacting that

13

language, had no reason to think that there was some

14

tribunal­based difference between the court of claims

15

and the district court such that the language would be

16

interpreted in fundamentally different ways based only

17

on the tribunal.

18

And

A final point I ­­ I would like to make,

drawing back, to just focus on what I understand to be

the basic divide between the parties in this case.

general presumption, the Irwin presumption, which wasn't
