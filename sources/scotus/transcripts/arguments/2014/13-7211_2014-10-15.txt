CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

Mr. Schaffer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. RANDOLPH SCHAFFER, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHAFFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
Ninety years ago, this Court held in

11

American Railway that an appellee need not cross­appeal

12

to raise an argument in support of the judgment that

13

does not seek to enlarge his rights.

14

prevailed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim

15

in the district court, did not have to cross­appeal here

16

for two reasons.

Petitioner, who

17

First, he did not seek more relief than the

18

new punishment hearing granted to him in this ­­ in the

19

judgment.

20

Second, he raised an argument that the

21

district court rejected as an alternate basis to affirm

22

the judgment, and if he did not need to cross­appeal, he

23

did not need a COA.

24

We made ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

3
Alderson Reporting Company

He ­­ I

Official

1

don't know if this is a new argument or a new issue.

2

And the reason I raise that is when the judgment issued

3

here by the district court, it specified two errors that

4

had occurred and basically told the State court, fix

5

those two or you have to release the defendant.

6

Let's assume they fixed those two, and then

7

could you come back and say release him anyway because

8

they didn't fix the third that I lost on?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. SCHAFFER:

16

So how is it not more

relief?

13

15

No, not under those

I beg your pardon?
How is it not more

relief or different relief?
MR. SCHAFFER:

Because the single error is

17

that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.

18

That is a single claim, and it was based on three

19

allegations of deficient performance.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, now, wait a minute.

22

of counsel if Clarence Darrow makes one mistake.

25

mean, when ­­ when we find that there has been

You may have

I

ineffective assistance of counsel, I think that means

2

counsel failed to do one thing that he should have done.

3

counsel was ­­ was, in gross, ineffective.

You're ­­ you're ­­ you're describing it as

7

that's not what we hold when we find ineffective

10

That ­­

We find that this particular
That's it.

MR. SCHAFFER:

Well, let's take that a step

11

further.

12

to first isolate the errors of counsel.

13

one; it could be a hundred.

14

accumulate them and consider them together to determine

15

prejudice.

16

What the Court does to analyze an IAC claim is
It could be

It doesn't matter.

You

If the deficiencies in performance

17

constitute sufficient prejudice to undermine confidence

18

in the verdict, then counsel was constitutionally

19

ineffective, not because of A, B, C, or D, but because

20

the totality of his representation did not meet the

21

constitutional standard.

22

So it's not a matter of fixing any

23

particular error of counsel.

24

the ­­ the State's position is a little awry because a

25

Federal court judgment in a habeas case is different

And that's where I believe

5

than a direct appeal judgment.

judgment, the ­­ the court tells the district court,

3

We're sending the case back to you, do A, B, C, and D or

4

don't do X, Y, and Z.

5

On a direct appeal

A Federal habeas judgment is a lawsuit

6

against the warden having to do with the body of the

7

prisoner.

8

tell the State to do or not do any particular thing.

9

The effect of the Federal court judgment is to basically

10

say release the prisoner unless within, in our case, 120

11

days you resentence him to life or you give a new

12

punishment hearing.

13

The Federal court doesn't have authority to

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would your argument be the

14

same if all of the claims in this case were not

Assuming the coerced

6

confession involves the punishment phase as opposed to

7

the guilt/innocence phase.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MR. SCHAFFER:

The same phase, yes.
Okay.

I think that's a

10

situation where the State has a decent argument that

11

because it's a different claim, that would perhaps

12

entitle you to more relief under the judgment, that is,

13

not just a new punishment hearing, but a new punishment

14

hearing without the unconstitutional confession, that on

15

the state of the law today, I would file a cross­appeal

16

and move for a COA on a separate claim because I think

17

that would be Pfeiffer, Alexander, El Paso Natural Gas,

18

where you're seeking to modify the judgment and obtain

19

more relief than it would be American Railway.

State says, we sought to enlarge our rights under the

going to have the same thing when you go back, right?

It wouldn't be crazy

And in that

11

situation I would be seeking to enlarge my rights under

12

the judgment by having evidence excluded at a retrial

13

that's beyond the scope of the judgment.

14

the judgment gave me everything I wanted.

15

a word in that judgment that's adverse to me.

16

not a thing I could have asked for.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this case
There is not
There's

The argument is that what

18

the judgment was is the relief that you got is a new

19

sentencing hearing shorn of the particular errors the

20

district court found and those particular errors did not

21

relate to the Spisak or closing argument.

22

trying to say we had a judgment, we won, and ordinarily a

23

judgment winner can appeal if they won and if there is an

24

argument that was made on which the judgment won or

lost, that is not preclusive because he didn't have a

petitioner appellant who lost, obviously, on everything

8

below or the petitioner appellee who lost on a separate

9

claim that he's now desiring to appeal.

And ­­ and this

10

is kind of, I think, obvious to me if you look at habeas

Here the district court did not enter a

satisfy the showing of the denial of the Federal

contexts where the State court has the power, for

24

to probe what the judgment is that has informed the

But the fundamental ­­ the really important

5

point is that if the error recurs or if the State fails

to fix it, the remedy is immediate release, which we

8

of relief, which would necessitate a cross­appeal.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Oldham, some of my

10

questions to ­­ to your opposing counsel suggest that

11

ineffective assistance of counsel is mistake by mistake.

12

That there are here three claims of ineffective

13

assistance, not just one.

14

Maybe that's so.

What do you do with this case where the ­­

15

the trial court finds two instances of ineffective

16

assistance, the State agrees that those two are valid.

17

But appeals on the ground that it was harmless error,

18

that the cumulative effect of those two mistakes was not

19

enough to change the outcome of the trial.

20

The defendant, on the other hand, wants to

21

raise the issue that there was, indeed, a third instance

22

of ineffective assistance, and then if you combined all

23

three, there would have been sufficient harm to enable

24

setting aside the verdict.

25

What do you do with that case?

32

There ­­

there the three separate instances have sort of been

2

combined into one where ­­ where the issue is the

harmful effect.

MR. OLDHAM:

The answer, Justice Scalia,

5

would turn on the particularities of the third error of

7

sufficient to push it across the line of the Sixth

8

Amendment in the deficient performance standard, then

9

that would be the contours of the ineffective assistance

10
11
12

That is, if the third error was

of counsel claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So you would allow

that one to be ­­ to be raised without a cross­appeal.

Yes.

We agree with the

19

Clarence Darrow hypothetical from the top half of the

20

argument, which is that you measure the constitutional

21

error based on where the lawyer's performance

22

transgresses the balance of the Sixth Amendment.

23

if in the hypothetical, if that happened to have

Court has said twice in both the Miller­El and in Slack,

the language of this statute, 2253(c), imposes a list of

22

necessary but not sufficient conditions.

23

entirely within the provenance of the courts of appeals,

to deal with these issues on a regular basis, to

interpret that language to also apply to a prisoner who

is the appellee, who wants to raise an issue for the

2

court of appeal's consideration, both because that's the

3

purpose of the statute and because it was the pre­AEDPA

4

standard upon which the statute was enacted.

5

And so if I might just return to the Chief

Once it's in the

But it's in precisely that circumstance that

one of the most powerful exhibitions of a conditional

release order has worked out because in the ­­ in the

Wolf v. Clark case, the Fourth Circuit, the Commonwealth

17

of Virginia received a Brady remedy, that is, it ­­ it

18

had its conviction vacated because the ­­ the particular

19

evidence had not been turned over to the defense.

20

Now, that error, that particular error could

21

never be recommitted, but the Commonwealth violated the

22

spirit and the intention of that conditional release

order by interviewing the jailhouse informant that gave

24

the evidence, threatening him with perjury, and

convincing him not to testify at the second trial.

And in that circumstance, because the

conditional release order ­­ which was phrased

materially identically to ours, by the way ­­ the

the power of a Federal conditional release order,

14

MR. OLDHAM:

Well, this one couldn't have

15

been repeated.

17

it's actually a significantly greater obligation on the

over again.

47
Alderson Reporting Company

showing of the denial of a Federal right.

So they're saying the Federal right here

3

that we're deprived of is a Sixth Amendment right to ­­

4

to counsel, period.

5

There are a lot of different bases for it.

6

There are a lot of different things that happen, but

7

that's the single ground or right or, in this case,

issue doesn't change the word of ­­ that it used to

mean.

10

So call it this one thing.

It's so simple, and

at that point, let the court of appeals deal with it.

11

As soon as we try to separate different

12

bases for saying that this was a deprivation of the

13

right to counsel, we are going to produce a pretty good

14

nightmare because they shade into each other often.

15

We've offered this example in the briefs,

it's been ­­ and it's unrebutted in the reply that

13

depending on what the particular conditions are, the

State may forego and commute to a term of years, which

is the ultimate benefit to the prisoner.

16

incredibly important to give a prisoner the right to

the court of appeals to address that issue he has to

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH L. SCHAFFER, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHAFFER:

I'm a ­­ as the Court can

4

probably tell, I'm a fairly simple­minded person, and

5

when I looked at this and said is there anything I need

6

to do to get this closing argument in front of the

7

circuit in response to the State's appeal, I said:

8

Well, no; I won on ineffective assistance of counsel.

9

I'm just making another argument in support of the

10

judgment as to why there was prejudice, end of story.

11

That's the extent of my thought.

12

The bulk of these Federal habeas cases, as

13

I'm sure the Court knows, 90 percent or more are pro se

14

State court prisoners trying to navigate the treacherous

15

AEDPA waters without any help at all.

16

enough to win on the merits.

17

nightmare of even getting into the ballpark that the

18

State would have you create is like throwing out the

19

baby with the bath water.

20

to make it easy for the courts to acquire jurisdiction.

21

And it's tough

To create the procedural

The simple thing is we want

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The only way you can win

22

this, according to you, is if we rule IAC claims are one

23

claim?

24
25

MR. SCHAFFER:

No.

I can also win, Justice

Sotomayor, on the basis that, even if IAC is multiple

54

claims, I did not seek to enlarge my rights under the

2

judgment.

5

And it goes back to the State's position ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So when is it that you

have to cross­appeal?
MR. SCHAFFER:

If I want to enlarge my

6

rights.

7

and I lose on guilt phase whatever and I want more than

8

a new punishment hearing, I would have to cross­appeal

9

obviously in that situation.

10

For example, if I win on punishment phase IAC

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you answered no, but

11

then your explanation produces yes.

You're saying you

12

don't have to cross­appeal because you won on an

13

ineffective assistance of counsel claim; right?

14

is one, you know, omnibus ineffective assistance of

15

counsel claim.

There

You won on that; right?

16

MR. SCHAFFER:

Correct.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So your answer to Justice

18

Sotomayor should have been the opposite of what it was.

19

If you said yes, you should have said no. If you said no,

20

you should of said yes.

21

MR. SCHAFFER:

I do that all the time.

But

22

my understanding was she was asking me when would you

23

need to cross­appeal, and I was saying the scenario in

24

which you would.

25

This is not one of them.

Thank you.
