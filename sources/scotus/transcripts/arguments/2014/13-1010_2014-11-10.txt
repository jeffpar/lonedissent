ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MS. HO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

A promise of unalterable, costly healthcare

11

benefits should be negotiated at the bargaining table,

12

not imposed at the courthouse.

13

the Sixth Circuit has required courts to infer from

14

contractual silence a promise of vested benefits.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In a series of cases,

But the ­­ we're dealing

16

with a case where there isn't silence.

17

matter of construing what the words mean, but for

18

example, this collective bargaining agreement says that

19

the employees will receive a full company contribution

20

toward the cost of health benefits.

21

MS. HO:

I mean, it's a

That's not silent.

Your Honor, respectfully, it is

22

silent with respect to the duration of the full company

23

contribution toward benefits.

24

which I understand Your Honor to be focusing on,

25

indicates that the individual has to be retired; in

The word "receiving,"

term.

4

It's not ­­ it's not a durational

And so ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's what you say, but

5

there was a hearing by the district court.

6

recommending we apply ordinary contract principles, no?

7

MS. HO:

Yes.

You're

There's ­­ there's no

8

disagreement and the courts of appeal don’t ­­ don't

9

disagree that ordinary contract interpretation

10
11

principles apply.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Assume ­­ assume that I

12

find those words ambiguous, you have a hearing.

13

district court had a hearing, and it didn't ­­ I don't

14

think the district court relied on a presumption.

15

relied on a bevy of evidence, including the fact that

16

your company bought the predecessor company, assessing

17

the health contributions at full value for retirees.

18

The

It

Why ­­ why wouldn't ordinary contract

19

principles permit the district court to do exactly what

20

it did here?

21

MS. HO:

Justice Sotomayor, I want to go

22

back to ­­ to the first part of your question which

23

said, well, wasn't ­­ wasn't there a trial here?

24

our position is that it never ­­ it never should have

25

gotten to that because the district judge initially, as

4
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

a matter of law, looked at the contract language here,

2

declined to apply Yard­Man, and said, I don't find a

3

promise of vesting.

4

On appeal, the Sixth Circuit said, we

5

disagree.

6

inference of vesting here and instructed the district

7

judge to apply Yard­Man on remand, which the district

8

judge did, and on page 20 of Petitioner's appendix, in

9

the opinion on remand, the district judge says, "Those

10

directives," meaning the Sixth Circuit's directions in

11

Yard­Man, "require this Court to reach the conclusion

12

That the part that the plaintiffs here obtained vested

13

benefits."

14

Under Yard­Man, there is at least an

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Ho, I'm wondering if you

15

would agree with this.

16

again, forget all the history that you just said, if we

17

could start all over again, you, I think, just agreed

18

that we would use ordinary contract principles; is that

19

right?

20

MS. HO:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If we could start all over

Correct.
Okay.

So ordinary contract

22

principles, we would ­­ first, we would look at the

23

agreement, and if the agreement said something clearly

24

either way, whether it was for vesting or against

25

vesting, the agreement would control; is that correct?

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. HO:

That's correct.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And if the agreement was

3

ambiguous, we could take extrinsic evidence to clarify

4

the terms of the agreement; is that correct?

5
6

MS. HO:

Objective extrinsic evidence, yes,

that's correct.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MS. HO:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

You acknowledge that?

See,

I wouldn't acknowledge that if I were you.

10

12

Okay, so ­­

Well, Your Honor, I'm ­­
You don't believe in the

parol evidence rule?
MS. HO:

Objective ­­ objective extrinsic

14

evidence, Your Honor, would be ­­ in other words,

15

admissible ­­ admissible on a finding of ambiguity.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MS. HO:

Custom, practice.
But I ­­ but I think it's

18

important, Justice Kagan, if I may, to point out that in

19

the Sixth Circuit, and I think this is one way in which

20

what happened here departs from ordinary contract

21

interpretation , is that in the Sixth Circuit, the

22

inference applies of vesting based either on text or ­­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

MS. HO:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, I hear you.
­­ or extrinsic ­­ extrinsic evidence.
Yes, I hear you.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

I was not

Official

1

getting you to agree with Yard­Man and I was not getting

2

you to agree to the Sixth Circuit.

3

MS. HO:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Certainly, Your Honor.
Yes.

But what ­­ what I

5

want to ­­ is you look at the text, if the text says it

6

either way, you go with the text; if the text doesn't

7

say it either way, it's permissible to look at extrinsic

8

evidence, like, the practice of the parties and, you

9

know, what you sold this for and things like that.

10

MS. HO:

Well, I ­­ I would agree with you

11

up to a point, and I think where ­­ where I might part

12

company or maybe add to that discussion would be to say

13

that ordinary contract interpretation does say, I think,

14

in McCutchen this Court referred to that, in

15

Stolt­Nielsen this Court applied the principle that

16

where a contract is silent, courts apply the relevant

17

default principles; in other words, silence ­­ I just

18

want to make clear that silence doesn't always equal

19

ambiguity.

20

And our position ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but then you get to

21

Justice Ginsburg's question, don't you, which is that

22

this is a case where actually the parties are disputing

23

language.

24

silence.

25

language that's very good for your side, which is that

It's not really a case where there is
I mean, you've come in and you've given some

duration clause, and the other party has come in and

2

focused on the word "receiving" and focused on the tying

3

arrangement between this and pensions, and focused on

4

the surviving spouse clause.

5

some language, they have some language.

6

MS. HO:

So you have ­­ you have

minimum, that's why we're entitled to reversal and a

we think ordinary contract interpretation says where

there is ­­ where there is silence here, and there is no

21

durational term, there's no indication of vesting,

22

there's no indication of how long the full company

contribution should last, that where there is silent ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, you keep saying

and as I pointed out, one side is not silent.

5

6

MS. HO:

There are

I think there ­­ there is

7

silence ­­ there is no question that there is silence in

8

the operative term of the promise, which is a full

9

company contribution toward healthcare benefits.

It's

10

true that the other side has pointed to various textual

11

cues that I think, if anything, Justice Ginsburg,

12

underscore the lack of such terms in the one place in

13

the contract where we would expect it to be.

14

is in the ­­

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that

But I thought your –but I

16

thought your position here was that what the contract says

17

under ordinary principles of contract interpretation is not

the point.

20

and said the Yard­Man presumption controls, and that's

21

what the district court thought.

The point is, is that in the first court of

22

MS. HO:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the question ­­ the

24

principal question here is whether the Yard­Man

25

presumption should have a ­­ play a significant part in

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

the interpretation of this contract, and you say no.

2

MS. HO:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Correct.
And there would be ­­ and

4

presumably there would be ­­ we could make that decision

5

in remand so that we don't interpret this contract

6

initially without ­­ without the benefit of what the

7

district court and ­­ and the court of appeals would say

8

without the Yard­Man presumption if you prevail.

9
10

MS. HO:

Certainly, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Unless, of course, the

11

Yard­Man presumption is normal contract interpretation.

12

That is, you know, the court of appeals could be saying

13

that when you look at the totality of the contract where

14

the benefits are being given for, as payment for work,

15

you get them if you've worked so many years, they

16

increase when you've worked more years.

17

the case, it is a reasonable assumption, call it a

18

presumption if you like, that any promise to pay those

19

benefits continues after the termination of the ­­ of

20

the union contract.

21

the court of appeals would agree that ­­ that this

22

presumption is contrary to normal contractual

23

interpretation.

24

that is normal contractual interpretation.

25

MS. HO:

Where that is

In other words, I'm not sure that

I think the court of appeals would say

Justice Scalia, I think there's ­­

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I think you're right that the Sixth Circuit would and

2

has said that all it's doing in these cases is applying

3

ordinary contract interpretation.

4

Sutton and others have pointed out, saying doesn't make

5

it so.

6

look at the ­­ when you look at the cases, and I think

7

this case is a good example of the work that Yard­Man is

8

doing.

9

footnote in its opinion, acknowledges that ordinary

10

contract interpretation rules apply with respect to

11

interpreting the contract generally.

12

to the issue here, which is the duration of the –of the

13

contract, the Sixth Circuit itself in Yard­Man said that

14

the normal "strictures," was the word used, doesn't

15

apply.

16

I think as Judge

And I think there can be no question when you

And Yard­Man itself, Justice Scalia, in a

But with respect

So I think at least as an initial matter,

17

the Sixth Circuit did not conceive of this as ordinary

18

contract interpretation and that it's really its own

19

policy­based rationales for why it's appropriate, in a

20

sense, to put a thumb on the scales here in favor of

21

retiree.

22

But I think if you look at –if you look at the

23

rules, maybe that's the most clear way to see that it's not

24

ordinary, is saying to courts you can look at text or

25

extrinsic evidence.

That's not normal contract

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

interpretation. To say to courts you ­­you can ignore a

2

contract duration clause if it doesn't specifically refer

3

to retiree health care benefits.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, we know that

5

contracts have certain assumptions about them, about

6

what continues.

Arbitration provisions continue after

7

the expiration.

We have found that, correct?

8
9
10

MS. HO:

Correct.

In the labor context,

that's correct, whether the labor ­­

15

MS. HO:

as a vesting

I would respectfully disagree with

16

that, Justice Sotomayor, for two primary reasons:

17

think the first reason is that all of these other

18

textual cues are reasonably read in conjunction with the

19

contract, both with the contract expiration clause,

20

which ­­which says that the benefits are for the duration

21

contribution language, as ­­as the district judge in this

case initially held when looking at that language, does

17

not have a durational term that's not sufficient to

19

Your Honor raised the issue of the term of the agreement

20

and applying during that, in terms of going forwards, I

21

just want to be clear, we have never sought to terminate

22

the benefits, and, in fact, now the retiree benefits are

23

the subject of mandatory bargaining ­­

24
25

In this particular case, and I think

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But could you have ­­ if

the collective bargaining agreement has expired, you

have your duration clause, and the company instead of

2

saying, retirees, we're going to make you contribute

something to the health care, says:

4

expired; no health coverage at all for retirees.

5

your theory, I assume they could do that.

6

MS. HO:

Well, the contract

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the fact ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it your position that

13

once the contract expires, the employer is free to say

14

no health coverage for retirees, period?

15

MS. HO:

If there has been no vesting, yes.

16

In this case, the company, each successor company and

17

the union, entered into a series of agreements ­­

19

question.

it's a nice company; but it doesn't have to be a nice

The answer is yes, right?

The company can

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What I would like to hear,

earlier you said there were two reasons:

5

6

be read in light of the background rule ­­ then you got

7

8

rule you were about to refer to was.

9

One was the

And I really want to know what the background

MS. HO:

Certainly, Your Honor.

I think

10

there are two background rules in play here.

11

first rule is that we don't normally read into silence

12

where parties have undertaken extra­statutory

13

obligations or extraordinary undertakings.

14

read those terms into silence.

15

serious undertaking as a promise of health care benefits

16

for life were to have been made, that we would expect to

17

see it, just like this Court said in the Tern case about

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We don't

We expect that if such a

What's the second one ­­

before you get cut off again, what's the second one?
MS. HO:

Certainly.

And I think the second

22

background rule here is related to the first.

23

that's the extra­statutory obligation here, that where

24

Congress has said in ERISA, it's explicitly exempted

25

welfare benefits from automatic vesting.

15
Alderson Reporting Company

And

So, if the ­­

1

in other words, what's being asked for here is the

2

exception to the rule.

3

clear in the contract.

4

So we would expect to see that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Ho, Congress has said,

5

yes, in pension benefits, there's vesting.

6

health care benefits we leave it to the parties; is that

7

right?

8

MS. HO:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And in

That's correct.
So it doesn't have any

10

implication for health care benefits other than we leave

11

it to the parties, isn't that right?

12

MS. HO:

I would respectfully ­­ maybe I

13

would not so much disagree as take that a step further.

14

I think it does have an implication here because it

15

establishes a default rule that, unless as a matter of

16

contract there is an agreement to vest, then the

17

benefits otherwise do not vest.

18

expect, applying normal contract principles, would

19

expect to see that clear on the face of the contract.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I think we would

Well, but then you're back

21

to your first background rule, which is that we would

22

expect to see this if it were there.

23

mean, that seems ­­ that statement has its corollary,

24

right?

25

would expect, we would expect to see if the union had

3

We would expect to see

And, indeed, I think that there's an amicus

4

brief in this case that suggests that there was a survey

5

done of all these agreements and about 60 percent of

6

them say quite explicitly unvested.

7

that.

8

and you have some language and they have some language

9

and some judge has to figure it out.

10

So there we are.

MS. HO:

Yours doesn't do

We're left with this ambiguity,

Well, and I think ­­ I think your

11

question raises two issues, one of which goes back to

our previous discussion about the role that ERISA has to

play here.

Right, but there's no obligation to

the clear language, to seek the promise, as opposed to

the party who doesn't.

6

don't know whether the figure is 40 percent or whatever

7

it is ­­ there isn't anything explicit one way or the

8

other?

Why is it that in this collective

I think ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

This certainly can't be

11

something that didn't occur to the employer or to the

12

union.

13

they choose not to address it expressly?

14

Why did they choose to leave it silent?

MS. HO:

Why did

I think there ­­ one could consider

15

that they didn't express it directly or one could read the

16

contract as saying there simply is no ­­ silence says

17

there is no promise of vesting here, because that is an

18

extraordinary obligation for a company to take on.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about "Retirees will

receive health benefits as long as they are eligible for

22

like as long as they're getting the pension, they will

23

get health benefits?

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MS. CLARK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As the Court has so aptly noted, this is a

contract dispute, and our argument is simply that

contract disputes relating to retiree health benefits

10

should be decided like every other dispute under a

11

collective bargaining agreement.

I tend to agree with him.

That's music to my ears, Your

Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

music, but it ­­ Yard­Man says that retiree healthcare

23

benefits are not subject to the stricture of ordinary

24

contract interpretation and ­­ I mean, that's what

25

Yard­Man says, and so I think you would have to vacate

24
Alderson Reporting Company

1

if we're going to say apply the normal principles of

2

contract interpretation.

3

MS. CLARK:

I have two answers to that.

Let

4

me start with what Yard­Man actually did.

5

the entire opinion, and unfortunately it's rather long,

6

it details a number of contract provisions in that

7

contract which the Court found supported the intention

8

of both parties to create a benefit that would last

9

beyond the expiration of the collective bargaining

10
11

If you read

agreement.
There was, for example ­­ and this is kind

12

of the ­­ the most obvious contrast, the retiree benefit

13

was described with some words like "continues."

14

benefit for the surviving spouse of a retiree was stated

15

to continue as long as this contract is in effect.

16

The

Now, the Court took that, rightly so, to

17

suggest that the retiree would have a lifetime benefit,

18

but that a surviving spouse, who was still alive after

19

the retiree died, would continue to have benefits until

20

the next agreement ­­ I'm sorry, the agreement, because

21

it kept ­­ it kept rolling forward in agreements.

22

the surviving spouse was limited to the term of a

23

contract while the retiree was not.

24
25

So

There are a number of other contract
provisions that they note, which very clearly supported

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the inference that the retiree's benefit was intended to

2

continue.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know you're

4

saying that you win without Yard­Man, but ­­ but it

5

still seemed to mean something to the Sixth Circuit.

6

And the many other courts of appeals that have addressed

7

the question have distinguished what they're doing,

8

saying, you know, we're not going to follow Yard­Man.

9

We're going to apply normal principles of contract

10
11

interpretation.
MS. CLARK:

And, Your Honor, that was where

12

I was getting to the second piece of my argument ­­ the

13

second piece of my answer to your question.

14

that we believe, particularly based on the limited

15

arguments that were made by Petitioner below, that this

16

Court could affirm this decision on normal principles of

17

contract interpretation, but if the Court wants to be

18

sure that the judgment below is, in fact, based on

19

normal principles of contract interpretation, we are

20

perfectly comfortable with a remand for that purpose.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that is

Now, the only point of

that traditional rules of contract interpretation don't

think that the ­­ the essence of the Yard­Man inference,

24

different from what this Court recognized in the Nolde

5

6

7

the Court in Litton and in Nolde recognized that those

8

promises, as a normal rule, will continue.

9

So if the

10

And accordingly the Court, dealing with an

11

issue of severance pay in Nolde, where all that there

12

was in the contract was a promise that there would be

13

severance pay proportional to years of service, said

14

that when the employer closed the plant after the

15

contract expired, that there was a possibility that that

16

severance pay was intended still to be paid to people

17

who had earned it, and therefore ordered arbitration of

18

the dispute.

19

In Litton, the question was whether when the

20

plant laid off a number of workers after the contract

21

expired, was the employer obligated to arbitrate over

22

the question whether seniority should have protected

23

people in those layoffs.

conclusion that there was not the same kind of character

of deferred compensation about layoffs, seniority in

that people may have earned over time.

So the Court was ready without any explicit

language in the contract, without any presumption, to

5

say this is an issue that has to be determined by the

6

processes that are normally applied to determine

7

ambiguous contract promises.

MS. CLARK:

This Court addressed that in

that exceptions to that rule are determined by normal

21

contract interpretation.

22

And the clear ruling of the Court there was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what about the

23

arbitration context of Litton?

24

well, of course, it doesn't expire because you might

25

have disputes, particularly disputes going in connection

I mean, the idea is,

with the expiration.

2

arbitration requirements continue, really can't be

3

applied outside that context.

4

MS. CLARK:

So the idea in Litton, that the

Certainly, to the extent that

5

Litton says we're going to presume that the arbitration

6

promise continues, that does not apply here.

7

But the second level of consideration in

8

Litton, you know ­­ so the first question was the Court

9

says arbitration, we're going to presume it continues

10

unless the parties have made it very clear that it

11

doesn't, so that it can kind of clean up all the

12

disputes under the parties ­­ that ­­ that the parties

13

have.

14

But then the second layer was is the

15

particular contract provision in dispute here, there the

16

seniority provision that I mentioned a moment ago, the

17

kind of contract provision that we believe may have some

18

post­expiration binding effect on the employer.

19

Court contrasted Nolde, in which it was severance pay,

20

noting that that was in the nature of a deferred

21

compensation claim, and also pointed out that if a

22

particular contract right may be deemed to have accrued

23

or vested while the agreement was in effect, it would

24

normally remain in effect.

MS. CLARK:

That is one of the passages that

6

we're referring to.

on page 203 of the Court's opinion, which says, "A

8

similar duty, i.e., a constraint on the employer after

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And did these contracts

arise before or after Yard­Man?
MS. CLARK:

These ­­ the initial contracts

13

were pre­Yard­Man.

14

For instance, the 95­point rule in this agreement was

15

post­Yard­Man.

16

previously, it was somebody with at least 10 years of

17

service gets 100 percent paid, and they made that a

18

little bit less generous for people who are hired after

19

the change was made.

20

with ­­ as you know, it's proportional to that for

people with less than 95 points in age and service.

They've obviously been renegotiated.

23

the basic pattern of retiree gets these benefits with a

full company contribution, the language about the

25

retiree receiving a pension, which, in my mind, very

40
Alderson Reporting Company

plainly does speak to duration, as does surviving

2

spouse, until death or remarriage.

read those words to mean anything other than duration.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HO

19

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

20

MS. HO:

21

Three points:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
First, I think at a minimum

22

we're not hearing a lot here today defending Yard­Man.

23

I think there can be little serious question that

24

Yard­Man infected every aspect of the proceedings below.

25

Indeed, it was dispositive.

So I think at ­­ at a

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

minimum we're entitled to ­­ to a vacatur and remand for

2

ordinary contract principles to be require ­­ to be

3

applied.

4

We think that requiring clarity is

5

consistent with those principles, but even as a matter

6

of sort of what ­­ what Respondent has suggested in

7

terms of reasonably susceptible, the standard that

8

Justice Sotomayor mentions, I think it will be important

9

if this Court remands for consideration of ordinary

10

contract interpretation, that it's clear that what the

11

Sixth Circuit has been doing under that banner is

12

anything but; that looking at putting text on a par with

13

extrinsic evidence is not ordinary contract

14

interpretation; that ignoring contract expiration

15

clauses, unless they specifically reference healthcare

16

benefits, is not ordinary.

17
18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
true.

I'm not sure that's

I ­­

19

MS. HO:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Respectfully ­­
The language of vesting

21

has to be reasonably susceptible from something in the

22

contract.

23

MS. HO:

Correct, Your Honor.

We ­­ we

24

absolutely agree with that, and we ­­ and we believe

25

here the full company contribution language, which is

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the promise at issue, that's the language that the Sixth

2

Circuit looked at.

3
4
5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the contract as a

whole.
MS. HO:

In other words, a full company

6

contribution toward healthcare benefits, when read in

7

conjunction with the contract's expiration clause, it

8

says for the duration of this agreement.

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
MS. HO:

How about the spouses?

We believe that those ­­ those

11

provisions indicate when the benefits would ­­ would ­­

12

would cease; in other words, until death, until

13

remarriage.

14

the absence of such language in respect to the promise

15

to retirees where ordinary contract interpretation would

16

tell you if ­­ if ­­ if a promise were made, that's

17

where it would have been made.

18
19
20

And if anything, Justice, they highlight

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you saying it does

continue as to the spouse?
MS. HO:

I didn't get the point.

No, Your Honor.

Our point ­­ our

21

point is that the benefits are for the term of the

22

agreement until death or remarriage, both events that

23

can happen during the term ­­ during the term of the

24

agreement.

25

language that the Sixth Circuit looked at or considered

And in all events, Your Honor, that's not

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in making its determination here that the benefits

2

vested based on the Yard­Man presumption and inference.

3

So at a minimum we believe that we're

4

entitled to a vacatur and remand for the Court of

5

Appeals to apply proper principles of contract

6

interpretation in the first instance.

7

If there are no further questions.
