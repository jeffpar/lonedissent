JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's what so ­­ so

volume limit itself, you can't sell more than 60 percent

15

of your crop.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if it wasn't, if ­­

5

MR. McCONNELL:

At least with this reserve

Well, it ­­ it all depends.

6

The way volume controls generally work is that the owner

7

of the produce is permitted ­­ they have to hold back a

8

certain amount in a reserve and then they're permitted

9

to sell that reserve as the market conditions continue.

10

In this case, of course, the RAC sold the

11

raisins, in some cases even above the field price.

12

There was a market for the raisins, so I would assume

13

that volume controls under these economic conditions

14

might have left the ­­ these particular people better

15

off than under the current circumstance.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what you're

complaining about is the administrative expenses?

that from time to time and this Court two years ago in

16

in fact, there is a fundamental difference between a

completely open to the market.

5

you ­­ they're ­­ they're essentially valueless because

6

you don't need them to satisfy the existing market.

7

take them off the market to prop up the prices of the ­­

8

of the free­tonnage raisins, and then the committee will

sell them when they will not undermine ­­ or in a manner
