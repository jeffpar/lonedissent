ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. WILLIAM M. JAY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In our judicial system, the trial judges

12

find the facts.

13

fact­findings deferentially under Rule 52.

14

courts apply that familiar standard, even whenever the

15

ultimate question is one of law, but it rests on

16

subsidiary fact­finding.

17

Courts of Appeals review those
The Federal

Now, the Federal Circuit says that claim

18

construction is different, that there are no facts in

19

claim construction, but more than a hundred years of

20

practice from this Court makes clear that that's not

21

right.

22

so when the trial judge does what this Court has

23

instructed her to do, to find what a person of skill in

24

the art already knows as relevant to interpreting the

25

patent.

Facts can enter claim construction and they do

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you bring it down to

2

this case and tell ­­ tell us what are the facts to

3

which the Federal Circuit should have applied clearly

4

erroneous rule?

5

MR. JAY:

Certainly, Justice Ginsburg.

6

There are three in our view.

7

Federal ­­ the Federal Circuit failed to defer to the

8

trial court's finding about the presumed meaning of the

9

term "average molecular weight" in the ­­ in the

10

The first is that the

relevant context.

11

The second is that the trial ­­ Federal

12

Circuit failed to defer to what the district court

13

expressly found resolving an expert dispute was the

14

import of Figure 1 and where the peak of the curve in

15

Figure 1 appears.

16

And the third is how a person of ordinary

17

skill in the art would have read a piece of the

18

prosecution history.

19

So if I may, I'll begin with why the ­­ the

20

reference to average molecular weight in the patent and

21

the ­­ and the specific reference to size exclusion

22

chromatography, the particular technology being used to

23

find that, fits the rule that we're asking this Court to

24

adopt.

Before you ­­

I ­­ I want you to answer

that, but would ­­ would you say that it's whether a

3

skilled artisan would make this inference?

4

of the finding?

5

MR. JAY:

Is that part

Part of the finding is the

6

knowledge of a skilled artisan.

7

Sometimes ­­ sometimes the finding is just about pure

8

science, how an invention works, what ­­ what this Court

9

called it in the Winans v. New York and Erie case is

That's right.

10

terms of art or the state of the art.

11

state of the art can enter the analysis is when you're

12

using science to construe the patent.

13

And the way the

So, for example, at this temperature the

14

invention would work; at that temperature the invention

15

would not work.

16

must be Celsius and not Fahrenheit, for example.

17

Therefore, you know, the temperature

When you do that, when you're using science

18

and not words or structure as the ­­ as an

19

interpretative guide, that rests on fact­finding just as

20

much as ­­ as knowing the meaning of terms of art to

21

people with skill in the art does.

22

Now, the terms of art has a lengthy pedigree

23

in this Court's cases, not just in patent cases,

24

although it's certainly strong in patent cases as well.

25

But in the interpretation of other written instruments,

5
Alderson Reporting Company

the ­­ the meaning of terms of art in a community to

2

which ­­ an interpretative community to which the trial

3

judge does not belong is exactly the kind of thing that

4

trial judges need the input from experts to determine.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's not true of

terms of art in statutes, is it?
MR. JAY:

Terms of art in statutes, Justice

8

Alito, are not ­­ are nonetheless written to be read by

9

the general public.

And what ­­ when they have a ­­

10

when they have a legal meaning, the determination of

11

that legal meaning is still a question of law.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, some of them are very

13

technical, and I doubt that the ­­ the general public

14

has any understanding of some very technical terms that

15

appear in statutes.

16

of what someone who is knowledgeable in that field would

17

understand the ­­ the term to mean?

18

MR. JAY:

So would they not be read in light

I think it's very rare for

19

Congress to adopt statutes that have terms ­­ that have

20

terms that are meant to be read by a specialized

audience ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'll give you an

25

any idea what Tier 1 capital is?

The Dodd­Frank Act refers to Tier 1 Capital.

MR. JAY:

I think when you're interpreting a

8

statute that it's generally clear at least what the

9

right frame of reference is.

Now, in the ­­ in the

10

patent case, what the frame of reference is is itself a

11

question of fact, as this Court said in Graham v. John

Deere.

Mr. Jay, could you tell

20

MR. JAY:

I think that the government agrees

22

with us that the answer to the question presented is

23

that Rule 52(a) applies and that clear error review

24

should apply to findings of fact.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

at the beginning of the argument are ­­ they are factual

findings.

and they ­­ we agree on the ultimate disposition that

the Federal Circuit's judgment can't stand.

10

We submit that the

The government agrees that some but not all,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you and the

11

government can't agree, why should we defer to a

12

district court?

13

now forever, to the Federal Circuit and let them review

14

these things de novo?

15

MR. JAY:

Why don't we defer, as has been done

Respectfully, Justice Sotomayor,

16

what's been done forever is deferring to district courts

17

on matters of subsidiary findings.

18

significant that in the first patent case that came to

19

this Court from the Federal Circuit, the new Federal

20

Circuit, Dennison, what this Court did was direct the

21

Federal Circuit to apply deference to subsidiary

22

fact­finding in the context of obviousness.

5

with other mixed questions of law and fact.

6

universal practice for mixed questions of law and fact

is that when they rest on subsidiary fact­finding, you

review the fact­finding part deferentially, even when

9

the leap from the fact­finding to the ultimate legal

I don't know that it's odd, Justice
I think that it actually fits of a piece
And the

conclusion is a short one.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In the Markman context,

12

the trial judge says to the jury:

13

of the claim is for the court, and the court's

14

construction of the claim is X, Y, Z.

15

determination by the district judge, which is for the

16

trial judge, involve some subsidiary questions of fact

17

as to which he must be given deference?

18

MR. JAY:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, the construction

Could that

Sir, I may have missed the ­­
It's a jury case like

20

Markman and Markman says the construction of the claim

21

is for the court, and the court tells the jury:

22

claim is to be construed as follows, A, B, C, D.

23

that determination, that interpretation by the district

24

court ­­ would that error contain factual determinations

25

as to which deference must be given to the trial judge?

9
Alderson Reporting Company

This
Does

1

MR. JAY:

A claim construction can contain

2

factual determinations.

3

will not, because the ultimate question is a question of

4

law and when it rests just on looking at the words in

5

the patent and applying the canons of claim

6

construction, it remains a pure question of law.

7

When ­­ when facts enter the analysis, those facts

8

decided by the trial judge in the context of findings

9

are reviewed deferentially.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It might not.

In many cases it

Well, is ­­ is it the same

11

question whether a particular fact has to be submitted

12

to the jury?

13

the judge is entitled to deference or are they ­­ are

And whether a particular fact­finding by

They are not the same question,

Justice Scalia.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. JAY:

I didn't think they were.
This Court resolved the judge/jury

19

question for claim construction in Markman, but ­­ and

20

there were no subsidiary fact­findings of the type that

21

we've been talking about in Markman, because

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You ­­ you've

2

referred several times to subsidiary facts.

3

the difference between questions of law and fact has not

4

always been an easy one for the Court to draw.

5

you mean by a subsidiary fact?

6

MR. JAY:

You know,

What do

I simply mean, Justice ­­

7

Mr. Chief Justice, that the ultimate question this Court

8

said in Markman is a question of law, but it often rests

9

on factual findings, knowledge of the ­­ excuse me ­­ of

10

the state of the art and of how the art works.

11

that's ­­ that's just as true in other mixed question

12

cases.

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Well, what's your

definition of subsidiary fact?

15

MR. JAY:

A subsidiary fact is a fact that

16

is not the ultimate question the court is looking at,

17

but one that is an ingredient in that ­­ in that

18

judgment.

19

often happens is the beginning of the analysis is:

20

is the meaning of this specialized term to people in the

21

art?

22

interpretation of the patent may show, as a legal

23

matter, that that can't be the right meaning because the

24

text of the patent itself, under ­­ applying the canons

25

of claim construction, for example, or simply applying

MR. JAY:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the court

11

may not anticipate at the time what the ­­ what the

12

ultimate outcome is going to be.

13

must make a judgment about which experts to allow.

14

I think that's an important point, that the judge

15

retains gatekeeping authority, and ultimately the judge

16

will decide how many terms she will allow the parties to

17

dispute and which ­­ what evidence to take and in what

18

form to take it.

Amendment?

MR. JAY:

I think, Justice Ginsburg, that ­­

23

first of all, this is not a jury case.

24

I'll answer the question for patent cases more broadly,

25

in which some are jury cases.

But, of course,

These are subsidiary

12
Alderson Reporting Company

1

fact­findings that go to a threshold question for the

2

court and in that respect they're no different than the

3

fact­findings that go into other pretrial judgments that

5

Rule 52 has been applied to judicial

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the government's

12

brief said ­­ and I think you agree with this, but

13

you'll tell me ­­ that inferences to be drawn from

14

fact­findings get de novo review.

15

is that in a typical civil case, a jury finds the facts

16

and can draw inferences from the facts, but here ­­

17

well, first do you agree with the government that

18

inferences from ­­ from the facts get de novo review?

19

MR. JAY:

No.

And my understanding

I don't think I can agree

20

with that, Justice Ginsburg, because that's not what

Rule 52 says.

Go ahead.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

­­ I ­­ I just want to make

12

sure I understand your answer to what the gap is between

13

a certain kind of fact and then the ultimate question of

14

law.

15

testimony about what a person in the field, a skilled

16

artisan in the field, would understand to be the meaning

17

of a particular patent term, and you are saying that

18

that's a ­­ that's factual and that the decision whether

19

to credit that or not is a factual determination.

20

how is that different from the ultimate legal question

21

that the Court has to answer, which is kind of the same

22

thing, it's how a person ­­ a skilled artisan in the

23

field, what ­­ what that person would understand a

24

patent to mean.

25

So when an expert gets on the stand and gives

MR. JAY:

But

Well, the difference is that the

14
Alderson Reporting Company

1

instances, and they will be frequent, where it's not

2

3

out.

4

expert says factual, the meaning to skilled artisans.

5

And it absolutely is, just as it is in this Court's

6

contract and tariff cases where the Court specifically

7

says that the meaning of a term to people in a

8

particular field, to which the judge doesn't belong,

9

that's a fact question, and ­­ so as to whether there is

10

Let me ­­ let me spell that

The first part of your question is, is what the

a specialized meaning.

11

But where there is no specialized meaning or

12

any specialized meaning is irrelevant because the patent

13

itself, through the process of document construction,

14

tells you what the answer is ­­ so, for example, here's

15

the ordinary meaning of this term, but that won't work

16

in the context of this patent because it would run up

17

against the canon of claim differentiation.

18

in this patent because it would make the invention not

19

work.

20

the preferred embodiment in the ­­ in the specification

21

wouldn't ­­ wouldn't be encompassed.

22

That won't

That wouldn't work in this patent because then

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So what you're saying is

23

that in certain cases the factual finding truly is the

24

legal determination, but that in other cases, other

25

matters can come in to drive a wedge between the two.

15
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. JAY:

Correct.

And I think that this is

a case where the out ­­ the facts come very close to

pointing to the correct outcome because ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Two ­­ two cases, and this

5

is part of Justice Kagan's question, I think.

skilled in the art would think that this was an average

molecular weight.

A person

Do the courts give the same deference

or lack of deference in each case.
MR. JAY:

I think, as I understand your

12

question, Justice Kennedy, in each question the person

13

on the stand is actually opining about the ultimate

14

question.

15

example, if the ­­ if the question is did the police

officer see the gun, that ­­ that may rest on a

17

credibility finding about whether the police officer is

18

telling the truth or lying.

20

was probable cause or not, on and off.

One way there's

probable cause; the other there isn't.

13

from the factual finding to the claim construction may

rest on something as simple as this:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS

13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

14

AS AMICUS CURIAE

15

MS. ANDERS:

16

please the Court:

17

Thank you, Mr. Jay.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Just to start with the distinction between

18

factual findings and legal inferences here, we think

19

that factual findings are those that are based, at least

20

in part, on evidence that is outside the patent and its

21

prosecution history and that concern matters that are

22

distinct from the patent itself.

23

factual findings about what kind of data a particular

24

scientific technique produces or how the inventions,

25

prior inventions in the field worked.

So those could be

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Those are factual

Official

1

findings.

2

We then think that when the district court

3

takes those findings and now it can understand the ­­

4

the concepts that are described in the patent because

5

it's made those findings, when the district court takes

6

those findings and then looks at the patent and asks how

7

would a person of skill in the art interpret the words

8

in this patent in light of all the pieces of the patent

9

document and the canons of claim construction, those

10
11

inferences that it draws are legal ones.
So I think to take ­­ to take the size

12

exclusion chromatography as an example of this because

13

it's probably easier to discuss it concretely, I think

14

what happened there was that the district court made a

15

factual finding that when SEC is used the type of data

16

that ­­ that just is spit out is ­­ produces peak

17

molecular weight, and if you wanted to produce any other

18

measure of molecular weight you would need to do more

calculations.

That's the factual finding that the

It then took a look at the patent document

22

and said, in light of that, what inference can I draw

from the specifications referenced to SEC, and the legal

24

inference that it drew was that probably the patent

25

meant to refer to peak molecular weight when it used the

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

term "molecular weight."

2

appeals understood the factual finding in the same way

3

that the district court did.

4

when you use SEC, the data that comes out is MP and you

would need further calculations to produce other types

6

of data.

weight is produced and that you'd need further

23

calculations to do other things.

Is that a factual

Because I think Mr. Jay

I think ­­ well, first of all,

22

that's not what the district ­­ what the expert

23

testified to here and what the district court found, so

24

I think we disagree about what the district court

25

actually said in its opinion.

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But if that were what the expert testified

2

to, then I think that would be a statement of fact, that

3

in ­­ in the world we understand generally that SEC

4

means MP.

5

I think that would be a finding of fact.

But I would make two points about that.

The

6

first is that there is then a significant legal analysis

7

that the district court has to do to figure out how to

8

construe the patent, and I think that's particularly

9

clear in the context of indefiniteness, which is what

10

this case is about, that even if the district court has

11

some evidence that generally artisans might understand a

12

term in a particular way, the court then has to look at

13

the claims themselves, the terms that ­­ that surround

14

the term we're trying to construe, the specification,

15

the embodiments in the specification, the prosecution

16

history.

17

given all of that, would a person of skill in the art be

18

reasonably certain about how to construe this patent.

19

So that is a legal inquiry that the court

20
21

It has to look at all of that and decide,

would have to do after receiving the fact­finding.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under your view, two

22

different district courts construing the same patent

23

could come out to opposite results based on a subsidiary

24

factual finding, and neither of those would be clearly

25

erroneous, and yet on a public patent that is going to

patent.

4

You have two different interpretations of the
What happens then?

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think that concern is

5

overstated for ­­ for two ­­ two reasons.

6

first is that it's ­­ it's pretty unlikely that that

7

scenario is going to occur, and the second is that, even

8

in the rare circumstances in which it did, there are

9

reasons to think that that's not actually a ­­ a problem

10
11

I think the

from a policy standpoint.
So ­­ so just to elaborate on that, I think

12

because ­­ because this inquiry needs to remain

13

primarily legal, because even after the court makes

14

fact­findings, it needs to engage in a contextual

15

analysis of the patent as a whole in light of the canons

16

of claim construction, we think that the legal questions

17

are generally going to predominate in the ­­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's just

19

kind of avoiding the question.

20

envision this case coming up differently in the district

21

court depending upon what district courts find as the,

22

you know, accepted understanding to artisans.

23
24
25

I mean, you can easily

And again, each of those opposite results,
neither one may be clearly erroneous.
MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think another point is

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that district courts I think have a way, have ample

2

tools to try to avoid that scenario from occurring.

3

They can, when there are seriatim cases, there can be

4

pre­trial coordination in the same district so that ­­

5

so that the situation doesn't arise.

6

preclusion will ­­ will prevent a patentee from having

7

an issue of claim construction decided against it and

then coming back and trying to relitigate the issue.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course,

What do we do when there's

10

a bus accident on a technical thing and different people

11

who were injured sue in different places at different

12

times?

Same problem, isn't it?

13

MS. ANDERS:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm ­­
Same problem.

I mean, you

15

can think of a thousand cases like that where ­­ where

you have a big bus accident, technical problem with the

17

motor, different place ­­ people from different places

18

who are victims and they sue in different places at

19

different times.

20

could reach different factual conclusions.

22

MS. ANDERS:

25

I think that is exactly

right and I think ­­

23
24

Juries or tried to the bench, they

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So what do we

do ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

29
Alderson Reporting Company

No.

It's because

Official

1

you have a patent which is a public document that is

2

binding the world in terms of what other inventors can

3

do and another inventor looking at it can say, well,

4

what can I do?

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.
He doesn't know.

7

That is very different than just a particular negligence

8

case that comes up.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, I was actually

10

curious what we did, because I can think of examples in

11

antitrust, I can think of examples in corporate law, I

12

can think of examples versus every area of the law,

13

where often it does happen, as the Chief Justice says,

14

it could ­­ the different factual things have enormous

15

public implications.

16

What I was interested in and asked because I

17

wanted to know, what are the legal devices for dealing

18

with that?

19

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I would make two points.

20

I think that, first, because of the way preclusion

21

works, it only runs against the patentee.

22

So if the patentee loses on an issue of claim

23

construction or indefiniteness, he cannot then

24

relitigate that issue, but other ­­ other accused

25

infringers can relitigate it and try to build a better

30
Alderson Reporting Company

All right.

Official

1

record.

2

We actually think that that ­­ that keeps

3

this from being a policy problem, the possibility that

4

you could have a subsequent decision that reaches a

5

different conclusion.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess a deed is a private

7

document that's ­­ has public effect, right?

8

prevents certain people from trespassing on the property

9

that is conveyed, and I suppose that could be construed

It

10

in the various courts that reach different results.

11

the mere fact that ­­ that this binds the public is ­­

12

is not conclusive.

13

MS. ANDERS:

I think

that’s right.

So

And of

14

course in the patent system now, there's a ­­ there's

15

toleration of a certain amount of disuniformity and I

16

think

17

other values that ­­ that supersede that uniformity.

18

So, for instance, you could have, in the case of

19

infringement, you can have two different accusers in

20

different suits; one makes a better record than the

21

other, and the patent could be held to infringe one

22

product but not infringe another materially similar

23

product.

24
25

that’s because we generally think that there are

6

7

I don't understand what that

If the evidence is ­­ is relevant, then it

district court is making a finding based on ­­ based on

9

science, based on expertise, somebody's ­­ somebody's

10

expertise in the field and making a finding about a

11

matter that isn't just what does this term mean in the

12

patent.

13

It's making a more broad finding.

So for instance, what does this type of

14

scientific process, what type of data does it produce?

15

You can say that's related to the patent because of

16

course the patent uses SEC and one question is what kind

17

of data does it produce.

18

fact to say, as a general matter, the way science works

19

is that SEC produces MP without further calculation.

20

But it is also a finding of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

It seems to me that the two questions that

18

were asked in the opening portions to my colleagues and

19

friends ­­ one came from Justice Alito, one came from

20

you, Mr. Chief Justice ­­ are matters that this Court

21

already has effectively decided in the Markman case and

22

are the reason why de novo review is appropriate under

23

these circumstances.

24
25

In effect, Justice Alito asked the question
is all of this worth the candle, because the debate

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

between the government and the Petitioner in this case

2

and the difficulty of trying to decide which facts do

3

you defer to and which ones don't you defer to and when

4

is it a credibility determination, when is it not.

5

Court said unanimously more than 15 years ago in Markman

6

that all of those kinds of issues get subsumed within

7

the fundamental question of how best to interpret the

8

patent, and that that's the ultimate question and that's

9

a legal question, and therefore, all of the disputes,

This

10

factual in nature or however you want to describe them,

11

get subsumed within that.

the ultimate conclusion from that then is whatever

determination is made is ultimately subject to de novo

review.

It seems to me the final ­­

for letting the district judge, I've always thought,

decide facts as an initial matter in a technical case is

because there are all kinds of facts, you know.

that obviousness carries with it a whole slew of

If a patent is like public law, if it's like

13

regarding the meaning of that patent are not entitled to

14

clear error review.

findings regarding the meaning of a statute are ­­ or

followed this path for well more than 20 years.

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

13

The figures are they followed the path and

MR. PHILLIPS:

But those numbers have

14

continued to come down, and the reason they've continued

15

to come down is that there was an enormous fight between

16

both the district courts and the Federal Circuit about

17

the methodology of claim construction.

18

decision of the Federal Circuit in Phillips made it very

19

clear, you look at the claims, the specification, the

dictionaries, and as a last recourse, if need be, you

And then what the district ­­ what the

could potentially have been a legitimate way to

interpret that.

13

But none of that gets you out of the box.

14

And indeed, every time their expert testified to this he

15

kept saying, well, it's because the prosecution history

16

refers to peak.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

15
16
17
18

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. JAY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

would like to make, I think, five points.
One is in response to Mr. Phillips's

19

suggestion that there aren't going to be many cases with

20

contested facts.

21

This is a case in which ­­ let's talk about figure one

22

in particular because we didn't touch on that as much in

23

the top half of the argument.

24
25

This is a case with contested facts.

The meaning of figure one is crucial to the
Federal Circuit because it said its understanding of

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

figure one was that it made it hard to credit our

2

interpretation of the patent.

3

opposed scientific evidence in the district court, would

4

the peak shift or would it not shift.

5

page 375a of the joint appendix, no, it wouldn't.

6

district court found as a fact that, yes, it would.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

disagree with you about that?

9

MR. JAY:

But there was directly

Dr. Ryu said,
The

Why does the government

The government agrees with us

10

100 percent about figure one and I think the government

11

says, and we agree with this as well, the error on

12

figure one is itself a sufficient basis to remand.

13

what might happen on remand I think you can't

14

necessarily predict because you can't disaggregate the

15

­­ all of these de novo conclusions from each other.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

Which From the facts that you

17

say are facts and the government says do not qualify as

18

to their test.

19

MR. JAY:

The government says that the SEC

20

point about presumed meaning, and I think ­­ the

21

government doesn't pay sufficient attention to the

22

presumed meaning fact­finding.

23

and on ­­ relating to the prosecution history.

But we disagree on that,

24

Now, Mr. Phillips alluded to the prosecution

25

history, and, Justice Sotomayor, this gets to your

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question that you asked me to address.

2

prosecution history by itself answer this case, and the

3

answer is no, it can't.

4

say that it did because when you have a patent that is

5

sufficiently definite in light of the specification,

6

that's the end of the matter.

Can the

The Federal Circuit couldn't

7

As the Federal Circuit said in Phillips, the

8

prosecution history ranks below the specification as an

9

interpretative aid, and if the patent is sufficiently

10

definite in light of the specification, and we say that

11

it is, and Dr. Grant said that it was ­­ Dr. Grant

12

referred to a number of things besides what Mr. Phillips

13

just told you about why peak was the more likely

14

meaning.

15

average are usually seen together, peak by itself.

16

So, for example, number average and weight

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, you didn't

17

answer my question.

18

said, mistake or not, you said it, you said it was

19

molecular weight, not peak, you're stuck.

20

If the Federal Circuit just simply

MR. JAY:

It can't say that, Justice

21

Sotomayor, because its own doctrine says ­­ what you're

22

positing is some kind of disclaimer, and a disclaimer ­­

23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, I'm positing an

estoppel of some sort.
MR. JAY:

Well, whichever way you see it,

57

that rises ­­ that requires a clear and convincing

2

standard, a clear and unambiguous standard that they did

two statements were made 4 years and 6 years after the

'808 patent issued.
