CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Our first case this

Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. FISHER:

9

please the Court.

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

In a country dedicated to the rule of law,

11

governmental officers should be presumed to know the law

12

at least as well as the citizens are.

13

when questions about individualized suspicion arise

14

under the Fourth Amendment, they should be addressed

15

against the backdrop of the correct interpretation of

16

the law, not simply any plausible reading an officer

17

might have.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That being so,

So suppose that this

19

State, North Carolina, did have a good­faith exception

20

to the exclusionary rule.

21

today?

22

MR. FISHER:

What would you be arguing

We would be ­­ still be

23

arguing, if that were the case, that not only the Fourth

24

Amendment was violated, but that the good­faith

25

exception didn't apply.

But you wouldn't have to reach

3
Alderson Reporting Company

that question in this case, and I ­­ and I would concede

2

to you, Justice Kennedy, that would be a debatable

3

argument under this particular ­­

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, why would it be any

5

more debatable than the argument you're making here?

I ­­ I ­­ I've more or less anticipated your ­­ your ­­

your answer.

9

applies, a mistake of law just doesn't count.

Well, that's not exactly what

11

this Court's jurisprudence holds, of course.

mistakes of law can be taken into account at the remedy

stage, and I think that would be ­­

Then ­­ and then ­­ but

16

17

when you say there cannot be a reasonable mistake of

18

law?

19

We know there can be.
MR. FISHER:

Well, there's a difference,

20

Justice Kennedy, between rights and remedies in the

21

Court's jurisprudence.

22

what is reasonable as to whether or not the Fourth

23

Amendment was violated, both in its Fourth Amendment

24

jurisprudence in criminal cases and in qualified

25

immunity cases, you would do that assessment against the

we're talking about whether as a ­­ as a categorical

5

matter, as a jurisprudential matter, we can have this

6

dichotomy known as a reasonable mistake of law, a

7

difficult and interesting question.

exception, as you're making here, and that you have a

11

problem with Davis and Krull.

12

a ­­ if you have a problem with Davis and Krull, then

13

that undermines your categorical argument.

14

MR. FISHER:

And if you don't have

No, I really don't think so,

15

Justice Kennedy.

16

this problem in the course of jurisprudence is actually

17

in the Anderson against Creighton case, the qualified

18

immunity case, where the Court wrestled with this notion

19

that how can something be reasonable in one sense and

20

unreasonable in another.

21

If ­­ I think the best exposition of

And the answer the Court gave is that when

22

we ask whether the Fourth Amendment was violated, we do

23

not take mistakes of law into account, but the

24

reasonableness of a mistake of law can go to the remedy

25

question.

This is the premise from which Leon, Krull,

5
Alderson Reporting Company

and Davis all derive, which is that there was a Fourth

Amendment ­­

preliminary question.

7

Even if you ­­ you're right about mistake of

8

law, isn't it a moot question in this case because, as I

9

understand it, the traffic stop ended with a warning

12

car, and the answer is yes.

14

So the traffic stop was over.

And at that

Why isn't the consent to

illegal.

There would have never been an opportunity to

Solicitor General haven't made any argument

19

that the consent wipes away the Fourth Amendment

20

question here.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose the officer

22

had said, all right, I'm giving you a warning.

23

free to leave now.

MR. FISHER:

You're

And the only

10

argument for reasonable suspicion is the mistake of

I don't

It would seem to me that there's a stronger

10

of law, because that's what the Fourth Amendment says,

11

as opposed to remedies and qualified immunity.

12

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, the Court

13

rejected that precise argument in Anderson, that textual

14

argument that the word "reasonableness" means that the

15

Fourth Amendment incorporates mistakes of law, and

16

because of a deep common law rule, which is that when we

17

ask ­­

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If I could just

pause.

20

MR. FISHER:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah.
I thought we said

22

exactly that in Herring, though, where we said that even

23

though we're going to look at it in terms of remedy,

24

that was not to say that the reasonableness didn't go to

25

whether there was a substantive violation of the Fourth

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Amendment.
MR. FISHER:

My understanding of Herring

3

would be that would be a mistake of fact case, whether

4

or not there was a warrant outstanding for

5

Mr. Herant's ­­ Mr. Herring's arrest would have been a

6

factual question, not necessarily a legal question.

7

In Anderson and Krull and Leon ­­ in Leon,

8

Mr. Chief Justice, the Court said the officer in that

9

case acted exactly as a reasonable officer could and

10

should have acted.

11

exclusionary rule cases, they've said the officer acted

12

reasonably because at the reasonableness stage, you can

13

take into account whether the officer reasonably

14

misunderstood the law.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I was just saying,

20

putting aside our discussion of Prouse and ­­ and

21

Herring, why does it make sense to say that you don't

22

take reasonableness into account when the Fourth

23

Amendment only protects against unreasonable searches

24

and seizures?

25

MR. FISHER:

I think for three reasons,

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Mr. Chief Justice.

2

theoretical reason, and a jurisprudential reason.

3

There's a practical reason, a

Now, I'll start with the theory because

4

that's where I was just describing.

5

heritage in this country that we have always followed,

6

and the best exposition of that is in the Court's Cheek

7

case, is that the criminal law is presumed to be

8

definite and knowable.

The deep common law

9

So in all kinds of settings, whether it be

10

punishing somebody for violating the law or any other

11

actions citizens or the government engages in, we always

12

assume a correct understanding of the law, even if it's

13

later construed by a court in a way that wasn't exactly

14

predictable or foreseeable.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it strange that you're

16

citing Cheek for that proposition?

17

hold in Cheek that under the ­­ in that ­­ in the

18

circumstances there, ignorance of the law would be a

19

defense?

20

MR. FISHER:

Didn't the Court

Because of a special statutory

21

exception that Congress had written.

22

part two of Cheek is what I'm relying on, Justice Alito,

23

where there is a paragraph or two that sets out with

24

numerous citations this principle Justice Holmes

25

described, and many others, that the criminal law is

10
Alderson Reporting Company

The beginning of

Official

1

presumed to be definite and knowable.

2

And once you take that presumption and put

3

it into the police officer's mind, in this case or any

4

other governmental actor who acts on a mistake of law,

5

then there is no reasonable suspicion because we

6

presumed them to have known the law when they acted.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

One is whether the officer

6

The Court has embraced that in

question asking about what if ­­ all that the officer

That

Again, I'm going to

10

turn the Court to Whren, where the Court said that if

11

there's a stop done for reasons aside from probable

12

cause, then the purpose of that stop, such as the

13

community caretaking function, might kick in.

14

course the State hasn't made any argument in that

15

respect in this case because the record is quite clear

We would then have

respect, Justice Scalia, I'm not sure the Court needs to

22

do that.

23

remand the judgment just as it does innumerable other

24

times where it finds a problem with the lower court

25

decision and therefore sends it back.

Of course, I think the Court can vacate and

important.

13

We've acknowledged that the question of

So what you would do is you'd ask the

14

question, if this were a Federal case where you had to

15

reach the question, you'd ask whether the officer's

16

mistake of law in this case renders suppression

17

inappropriate.

18

Now, I would ­­ I would add that holding

19

that it did render suppression inappropriate would be an

20

extension of the Court's current good­faith

21

jurisprudence, which thus far has held that good­faith

22

doctrine applies only when an officer relies on binding

23

law from a third ­­ from a legislature or a court.

that if ­­ if North Carolina applied a State

constitutional analog to the Fourth Amendment, they

could have a more extensive remedy than is recognized

under our Fourth Amendment cases.

violations that is more protective of defendants than ­­

the violation of the Fourth Amendment also violates the

5

North Carolina Constitution.

MR. FISHER:

Functionally, that's the way

2

things work in North Carolina, Justice Alito.

3

the only thing that ­­ that maybe I need to make more

4

clear is that the reason why it works that way in North

5

Carolina is because the State has held that violations

6

of our State constitution cannot be subject to a good

7

faith exception.

8
9

I think

The States have also held ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

The State constitution is

irrelevant because you're arguing about whether there is

10

­­ whether there can be mistake of law in determining

11

whether a search is reasonable under the Fourth

12

Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

13

Whatever we hold on that, North Carolina can do whatever

14

it wants on the same question with respect to the State

15

constitution.

16

MR. FISHER:

That's the next thing I was

17

going to say, is in theory you're right, Justice Alito,

18

but what North Carolina has said is that we construe

19

article 1, section 20, which is the State counterpart,

20

to be coterminous with the Fourth Amendment.

21

not the way the Court goes about its business.

functionally in the State of North Carolina where you

are is that Fourth Amendment questions run exactly

to support the conviction.

instance, and the other holding was this is a violation

8

of Fourth Amendment law, but the exclusionary rule

exclusionary rule operates and so the evidence comes in.

11

Is there any difference between those two holdings?

12

MR. FISHER:

I think the difference between

13

those two holdings, if the Court remanded, may well play

14

out differently in North Carolina.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

it were a Federal case ­­

Is there any difference?
If it were a Federal case, it

would be functionally the same holding as to the outcome

22

of that case.

But I think ­­ if I could.

3

make sure that you render that holding as to remedy

undermines public confidence in the law.

15

we take that argument any more seriously than the ­­

than the rule­remedy gap problem in law?

17

MR. FISHER:

So why should

Because that argument comes

18

from academic literature and my argument comes from the

Court's jurisprudence, where people have argued that you

shouldn't suspend remedy and the Court has rejected and

said, no, as Judge Wilkinson wrote in the law review

22

piece that I cited in the brief, there's an important

reason to announce the right even if you're not going to

to describe to the Court why you shouldn't hold that the

that anything that's reasonable, as the Court has

You ­­ you assert that ­­ that we ­­ we should not

decide the remedy question because it hasn't been

argued.

15

You're asking us to set aside a judgment of the North ­­

17

only if, number one, the Fourth Amendment was not

18

violated or, number two, it was violated, but the remedy

does not have to be exclusion of the evidence.

But wasn't it your responsibility to argue it?

That judgment can be set aside

20

It's ­­ it seems to me it's your burden to

establish not just that the Fourth Amendment was

violated, but also that ­­ that exclusion was necessary

MR. FISHER:

Well, if I need to argue it, I

would refer you to the part three arguments in our

3

opening brief, which explain why even if you move good

4

faith into the right ­­ those ­­ those would be my

5

arguments, Justice Scalia.

6

The only other case that comes to mind is

7

the Court's Ayolta case several years ago, where there

8

was a takings question brought to the Court, and the

9

Court divided that Federal law question into two pieces.

10

And when the lower court had only addressed the first

piece of the case, the Court reversed on that first

piece of the case and sent it back down.

what I'm asking for isn't terribly different.

court to decide the other piece.

person standard.

Would a reasonable person be able to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a very broad

11

definition of reasonable.

12

when, you know, 99 people out of a hundred think you

14

officer to think that.

I understand the idea that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

Chief Justice is asking you is to describe a case for us

6

where the officer would receive qualified immunity but

7

it would not count as reasonable for these purposes.

8

MR. MONTGOMERY:

One of the things that this

9

Court has said in Wilson v. Layne is that this Court and

10

courts can look beyond just the officer's interpretation

11

like this.

12

be an officer who ­­ who had an unreasonable

13

interpretation of the statute, and yet he may still have

14

qualified immunity, for instance, because he was told by

a judge or by the attorney general or by someone that

this was correct, and that was a complete

17

misunderstanding of the statute.

18

It can look to other matters.

There could

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. MONTGOMERY:

No, it would not.

But the

flip side of that is that an officer's belief that you

10

needed all of your brake lights, and that is not

11

actually the law, does not mean that that person is

12

guilty.

13

I

In other words, in this instance, this ­­

14

this driver ­­ excuse me, the defendant here or driver,

15

actually, could not be held liable for the brake light

violation.

17

thinks reasonably that the law is something.

18

doesn't make it the law, just like if a citizen does not

19

think that's the law, that does not mean that he can

20

escape liability.

21

So it's not that the fact that an officer

This is just another example of that, in

20

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'd like to focus

22

again on your definition of reasonableness.

23

you have two court of appeals decisions.

24

need two brake lights; the other says you need one.

25

Is it reasonable for the officer to pull

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Let's say

One says you

Official

1

somebody over when one of their two brake lights is

2

burned out?

3

MR. MONTGOMERY:

If you have conflicting

4

rulings from the court of appeals, it would be

5

reasonable then for the officer to decide which he

6

thought was the better rule, if there were two different

7

decisions from the court of appeals, which is not

8

supposed to happen in our system.

9

But if that did happen, then it would be

10

reasonable for the officer to rely on either one of

11

those.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Montgomery, I take it

13

that one of Mr. Fisher's arguments, maybe his primary

14

argument, is that this just looks like a remedies

15

question, it does not look like a rights question, it

16

focuses on the culpability of the officer in the way we

17

do when we think about immunity or when we think about

18

the exclusionary rule.

19

So why isn't that exactly right, that to the

20

extent that this conviction ought to be upheld, it ought

21

to be upheld on remedies reasons rather than rights

22

reasons to fit in with our basic understanding of what

23

remedies and rights do and do differently in our law?

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so it

What about ­­ what about

13

the dissenter in the North Carolina court of appeals who

14

said North Carolina has no good­faith exception, and so

15

all that this decision does is it allows the police to

16

get around the absence of a good­faith exception?

17

Wasn't that the position of the dissenter,

18

that allowing for a reasonable mistake of law to support

19

a warrantless stop is the functional equivalent of a

20

good­faith exception?

21

MR. MONTGOMERY:

That was the position of

22

the dissenting justices at the North Carolina Supreme

Court, one of the things that they said.

25

reasonableness as the standard for the Fourth Amendment.

11

MR. MONTGOMERY:

The remedy?

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You did not ­­ you did not

assert in your ­­ in your brief or you haven't asserted

14

it in oral argument, thus far, anyway, that even if it

15

did constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment, the

remedy did not have to be exclusion of the evidence, and

17

that remedy is indeed subject to reasonable mistake of

law, and therefore, the decision has to be affirmed.

19

But you didn't make that argument.

You want

20

to put all your eggs in the basket of whether it's a

21

violation of Fourth Amendment.

Am I right about this?

MR. MONTGOMERY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Mr. Fisher is correct in that it is our State

If a defendant had only raised a Fourth

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

A difference

does not ­­ this involves a mistake of law as to a

17

is that a reasonable violation of the Fourth Amendment

18

is still a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

And the difference in that

19

There ­­ if there's a statute that gives an

20

officer the opportunity to make a seizure on less than

21

what is required by the Constitution, less than probable

cause or less than reasonable suspicion, even if the

23

officer is reasonable, that is still a Fourth Amendment

24

violation, which is why this Court would have to go to

25

the remedy portion to decide whether the exclusionary

rule applied.
In this instance, this case, it was a

11

if he gets the statute wrong, then the Fourth Amendment

12

is not violated?

13

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Because the officer only

14

needs to act reasonably and the fact that he gets the

15

statute wrong does not mean that he acted necessarily

16

unreasonably.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the fact that he

18

made a mistake about what the Fourth Amendment requires

19

could also be reasonable.

20

MR. MONTGOMERY:

It could be, and that would

21

be proper to consider, as this Court has, in the

remedies stage rather than in the rights stage.

DeFillippo case

this Court found that there was probable cause in that

case for the officer to make an arrest based upon that

statute.

4

So that was one case in which this Court

5

looked at it at the rights stage as a mistake of law

6

rather than at the remedy stage.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, do you think if

8

DeFillippo came up again today, with all the cases that

9

have been decided since then, that we would decide it

10

the same way or do you think we would conceptualize it

11

now as a remedies question?

12

MR. MONTGOMERY:

I think the Court would

13

decide it the same way.

mistake of law; he wasn't following the law, presumably,

MR. MONTGOMERY:

That's right.

The

DeFillippo case is important because you had someone who

The one argument that is

importance of holding the way you recommend is so that

when you get this question solved, you tee up the

19

question, what is the rule, one light or two lights.

But yet in this case, it was consent.

The

evidence that came in had nothing at all to do with the

traffic violation, so we wouldn't need to ­­ the Court

I think the North Carolina Immediate

was consent, and this evidence comes in, and we never

3

MS. KOVNER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

4

And this question comes up in two contexts.

5

it would be litigated in the suppression context, and

6

sometimes it would be litigated because the officer

7

actually issues a citation.

8

in that portion of the brief is that if the Court takes

9

the position that whenever an officer is wrong about the

10

law, he has violated the Fourth Amendment, it's going to

11

deter officers from making stops where there are

arguments on both sides.

to say on reasonableness is that if it's not ­­ if it's

Well, I think, Justice Breyer,

19

the problem with that is that it's the core presumption

20

that the officer needs to understand the law as it

21

existed, as it was later construed.

22

And Mr. Chief Justice, you asked, I think,

23

about the ignorance canon.

24

well, if somebody is reasonably mistaken about the law,

25

we would convict him.

The State's response was,

with due respect to the Solicitor General, the founding

And

They're

10

only remedy cases, and they reinforce our point.

11

even when the Court has cited these cases, they're all

12

in the pre­Leon context where this Court didn't

13

distinguish rights from remedies.

And

14

If you want to look at the founding, the

15

controlling rule would be the common law rule.

16

we said in our brief, with no ­­ with no disagreement

17

from the other side, the common law rule dating back

18

centuries was that ignorance of the law on the police

19

officer's part, even if it was perfectly reasonable,

didn't justify the stop.

And as
