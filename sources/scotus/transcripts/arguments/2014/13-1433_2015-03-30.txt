CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

this morning in Case 13­1433, Brumfield v. Cain.
Mr. DeSanctis.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. DeSANCTIS
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MR. DeSANCTIS:

9

it please the Court:

10

We'll hear argument

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

The decision of the State court in this case

11

was to not ­­ to deny Kevan Brumfield a hearing on his

12

claim of intellectual disability.

13

based on an entirely unreasonable determination of the

14

facts of Brumfield's mental condition.

15

specifically ­­ the court expressly stated in its decision

16

to deny a hearing was, quote, "based on the three bases"

17

that it laid out in its oral ruling at Page 172 of the

18

Pet App.

19

That decision was

The court

And I'd like to discuss each of those in turn.

The first basis given by the State court was

20

that Brumfield scored a 75 on the Wechsler IQ Test.

21

That's not just suggestive of intellectual disability;

22

that's actual evidence of intellectual disability, and

23

there was no testimony in the record to the contrary.

24

This Court made it clear in Atkins, all of the clinical

25

texts on which this Court relied on in Atkins make it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

clear, and the Louisiana Supreme Court had made it clear

2

in Williams and in Dunn.

3

The second basis for the State court's

4

decision was that the defendant has not, quote,

5

"demonstrated impairment based on this record in

6

adaptive skills."

7

from the stone of the pre­Atkins record where neither

8

intellectual disability nor adaptive skills were even

9

raised, is completely unreasonable.

10

To demand or even expect that blood

9

defendant was not intellectually disabled, and yet the

There was no

But in that case, we probably

In the ­­ in Williams 1, the defense's own

10

Louisiana Supreme Court sent it back for an Atkins

11

hearing because Atkins had entirely changed the legal

12

landscape. Now here ­­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the first question ­­

14

the first question presented in your petition is

15

"Whether a State court that considers the evidence

16

presented at a petitioner's penalty phase proceeding as

17

determinative of the petitioner's claim of intellectual

18

disability under Atkins... has based its decision on an

19

unreasonable determination of the facts."

20

So suppose that at the penalty phase

21

proceeding there is evidence of 5 IQ tests, all above

22

140.

23

determinative?

24
25

Would it be wrong to say that that's

3

4

pre­Atkins record that disqualifies the individual from

5

intellectual ability, if that were the case ­­

6

For the purpose of making clear that we are not

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the answer to the first

7

question is no, it is not necessarily unconstitutional

8

to regard the penalty phase evidence as determinative.

9

MR. DeSANCTIS:

It is in this case on this

10

record, and Section (d)(2) is by its very nature a

11

factual inquiry.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. DeSANCTIS:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is ­­ is your point ­­
So ­­
Is your point that we are

15

involved in a wholly different inquiry once Atkins is on

17

at the sentencing hearing, you weren't talking about

intellectual disability.

Because when you were before the State court

21

some mitigating factors.

24
25

MR. DeSANCTIS:
right.

So the State court never had
An Atkins claim is raised

That ­­ that's exactly

It's ­­ it's similar to the reasoning that this

Court adopted in Bobby v. Bies.

2

setting, the Louisiana Supreme Court held ­­ or it

3

explained that prior to Atkins, as Your Honor just

explained, a defendant only had to show diminished

5

capacity as a mitigating factor and wasn't called upon

6

to marshal demonstrations of intellectual disability or

7

impairment in adaptive skills.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And in precisely this

Do you not think it would

have been ineffective assistance of counsel pre­Atkins

10

for a lawyer who had a client who was severely mentally

11

disabled not to bring that fact forward in the ­­ in the

12

sentencing hearing for consideration by the jury?

13

MR. DeSANCTIS:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your Honor ­­
Even ­­ even though it

15

wasn't, you know, a mandatory Federal basis for ­­ for

16

exempting him from the death penalty, surely you would

17

want the jury to consider that kind of evidence,

18

wouldn't you?

19

MR. DeSANCTIS:

Your Honor, this Court in

20

Henry and again in Atkins recognized that putting on a

21

defense of, quote­unquote, "mental retardation," as the

22

term was used at that time, is a double­edged sword.

23

It's a much higher burden typically than the lower

24

burden of putting on mitigating evidence of one's mental

25

condition.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I don't find that

persuasive.

4

to show that there was some basis for the State Supreme

5

Court coming out the other way, and that basis should

6

have been in the record, according to the Federal

7

statute, and your only defense is, well, we didn't put

anything in the record because Atkins had not yet been

Now, I do

know that this ­­ in this case you're saying you

provided some ­­ a sufficient amount of some evidence.

15

MR. DeSANCTIS:

unreasonable by not giving you a hearing to determine

the merits of your claim.

MR. DeSANCTIS:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
All right.

funds at that hearing, but I don't even think under

The magistrate judge, on April the 15th of

forth objective factors in this case and that he should

standard.

I think what Justice Breyer is driving at is just this,

and reasonable people might disagree on the answer to

this, but I think, you know, the determination that the

4

State court was making at that moment was whether to

5

have a hearing.

6

you disagree with this, I don't think anybody could

7

disagree with this, under Louisiana law, you have a

8

hearing when the defendant has come forward, and it's ­­

9

the burden is on the defendant ­­ but when the defendant

10

has come forward with some evident ­­ some evidence that

11

raises a reasonable doubt as to his mental capacity.

12

14

16

Breyer is suggesting is that when we ­­ when we realize

17

that that's the determination that the State court is

18

making, whether the defendant has come forward with some

19

evidence putting his mental capacity at issue, it looks

20

awfully like an unreasonable determination of facts to

21

say that this record does not meet that standard.

11

progress in this, because I agree with you, and I agree

with Justice Scalia that what we have to do –and there

14

in mind the fact that it was a pre­Atkins record, and they

15

didn't know about Atkins, but looking at the whole record,

16

is the Louisiana court clearly wrong?

17

in saying there wasn't enough evidence, even though there

has to be some, which is up to them pretty much how they

comes down to the question whether it was

Thank you, Your Honor.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. DeSANCTIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

23

First, the ­­ Dr. Jordan's report was not in

24

the record, and that is made clear at the Petition

25

Appendix 39a, note 13, where the court noted that

One a 75, and one a 54.

Finally, I want to emphasize that this Court

an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual

10

disability will be executed.

11

determination of the facts in this case created

precisely that risk.

13

just risk; it's certainty.

14

Mr. Brumfield with a hearing found that he is

15

intellectually disabled, and unless this Court reverses

16

the Fifth Circuit's erroneous ruling, an intellectually

17

disabled person will be executed.
