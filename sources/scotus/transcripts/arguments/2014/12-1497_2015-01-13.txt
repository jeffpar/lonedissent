ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. ELWOOD:

10

please the Court:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

By clearing the way for relator to file a

12

fifth identical False Claims Act complaint against KBR,

13

raising allegations the government had long known from

14

other sources, the court below erred in two respects.

15

First, the plain text and ­­ and history of

16

the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act confirmed that

17

it applies exclusively to crimes.

18

provision tolls limitations ­­

19

for offenses at the ­­ on the very day that that

20

provision went into effect.

21

The language of the

limitations periods

A neighboring provision, a nearby provision,

22

of Title 18 divided offenses into two categories,

23

felonies and misdemeanors, both plainly applying to

24

crimes.

25

divided offenses between capital offenses and noncapital

A neighboring provision, also of Title 18,

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

offenses, again, referring solely to crimes.

2

very telling that in 857 dual­column pages of Title 18,

3

neither the government nor relator has been able to

4

identify any provision that uses the word "offense" to

5

refer to a civil violation.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it

is

Is it unusual that a

7

criminal statute of limitations would be much longer

8

than a civil statute of limitations, which is the effect

9

of your argument?

10

MR. ELWOOD:

I don't think it is

11

necessarily.

12

Congress is trying to attempt.

13

the differences between how criminal law is prosecuted

14

and civil law is prosecuted, because recall that

15

Congress did ­­ it has its separate provision for

16

recognizing that the False Claims Act may be hard to

17

investigate at times, and it provided a discovery

18

mechanism there that doesn't apply to relators, it only

19

applies to the government, a three­year discovery period

20

with a ten­year backstop.

21

I mean, it depends on what exactly

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it reflects some of

Didn't some states used to

22

have no statute for ­­ for murder, and yet had a statute

23

of limitations on wrongful death claims?

24

that's ­­ that's the case, with respect to state law,

25

anyway.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

I think

Official

1

MR. ELWOOD:

But I think it all kind of

2

reflects the kind of differences between criminal law

3

and civil law, because the minute a complaint is filed

4

­­ I mean, most of the investigation, especially for

5

relators ­­ they don't have any legal status to conduct

6

investigations.

7

subpoenas.

So usually it's based on their own

8

knowledge.

They file a complaint, they come into court,

9

and then they have the Federal rules.

They don't ­­ they can't bring

Also at that

10

point, the government gets a 60­day period to

11

investigate, which is, on average, 13 months, according

12

to the Chamber of Commerce brief.

13

from the DOJ to the Senate.

14

and in this case, it is usually a couple of years.

15

It cites a letter

And in our own experience,

And during that time they have, you know,

16

all the time they want to investigate.

17

just reflects the fact that criminal litigation and

18

civil litigation are conducted differently.

19

So I think it

But clearly Congress already contemplated

20

how to handle delays under the False Claims Act, and it

21

enacted a civil provision for that under the FCA.

22

so I don't think the Court needs to import in this

23

general provision which applies only to offenses to

24

address the False Claims Act situation that Congress has

25

already specifically addressed.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

Now, all parties agree that the Wartime

2

Suspension Act began its life as a criminal provision,

3

an exclusively and explicitly criminal provision.

4

only question is whether Congress changed it along the

5

way to make it civil.

6

The

The thing that the relators point to is the

7

deletion in 1944 of the words "now indictable," but that

8

went unremarked in Congress, and you would expect

9

somebody to say something if they were fundamentally

10

transforming the nature of the statute.

11

what people understood those words "now indictable" to

12

mean at that time, if you look at ­­ if you look at the

13

other things that were around it at the time.

14

And that's not

Like, for example, 47 days after the first

15

Wartime Suspension Act was enacted, Congress ­­ for

16

crimes, and all agreed it was for crimes ­­ they also

17

enacted an antitrust suspension act which didn't use the

18

word "offenses."

19

said "now indictable" or "subject to civil proceedings,"

20

which shows that what was going on in that clause was

21

about the "now."

22

applies to things that came before this.

23
24
25

It used the word "violations."

And it

The ­­ it was to tell you that it

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This Court's

Mr. Elwood, I take the

14

point, and that seems like a fair understanding of why

15

that term came out.

16

they made at that point.

17

have had more than one reason, of course.

18

But it wasn't the only change that
And taking that term out may

So two other changes they make are, they put

19

in the word "any."

So the old statute just says

20

"offense" and now it's "any offense," which suggests

21

breadth and expansiveness.

22

course, is that they do all of this in connection with

23

this Contract Settlement Act, which presumably refers

24

both to civil and to criminal matters.

25

right after this Contract Settlement Act and suggests

And the other thing, of

And it follows

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

that it's following on it.
So, you know, put all those three things

3

together:

4

the putting in the word "any," and the passage in

5

conjunction with the Contract Settlement Act.

6

that that would be an argument on the other side.

7

The taking out of the indictment language,

MR. ELWOOD:

Sure.

I'll try to address each

8

of those.

9

bring me back to it if I forget.

10

I think

I have a pretty terrible memory, so just

I think "now indictable" is just to make it

11

forward­facing, because they were now not worrying about

12

just those cases.

13

forward­looking for the rest of the war.

14

They wanted to make it

With respect to "any offenses," it wasn't

15

just any offense simpliciter.

16

against the laws of the United States.

17

meant ­­ thought that was so unequivocally applied to

18

criminal law that that is the exact phrase they used in

19

enacting the statute giving district courts exclusive

20

jurisdiction over crimes.

21

they said "offenses against the laws of the

22

United States" in 1948.

It was any offenses
And Congress

They didn't say "crimes,"

23

And what was the third point?

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

MR. ELWOOD:

Contract settlement.
I told you I was a terrible

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

memory ­­ pardon me?

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

MR. ELWOOD:

4
5

Contract settlement.
Oh, and the Contract Settlement

Act.
I mean, they say it was, you know,

6

predominantly a civil statute, and it did create a big

7

administrative state, or an administrative apparatus.

8

But the provisions that they ­­ the causes of action

9

they created are actually ­­ the primary ones it created

10

were not actually subject to a statute of limitations,

11

so it would have been curious to try to toll them.

12

For example, the thing ­­ and this Court

13

said in Kohler that 26(b)(1) of the ­­ of the Surplus

14

Property Act wasn't subject to any statute of

15

limitations.

16

19(c), which is the one that the relator and the

17

government both pick out and say, aha, look at this, a

18

new civil cause of action.

19

toll that.

20

There was an analogous provision in that,

They were probably trying to

But as the Solicitor General said in

21

footnote 3 of their Kohler brief to this Court, the

22

remedy in that is substantially like the remedy in 20(b)

23

­­ in 26(b)(1), with the suggestion being that it was

24

not itself subject to a statute of limitations, which is

25

what the district courts that have addressed 19(c) have

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

said, that it wasn't subject to a statute of limitations

2

as they ­­

3

applied a statute of limitations to both 26(b)(1), which

4

this Court overruled, and to 19(c).

5

the district courts had a better ­­ had the better of

6

that argument.

7

SG’s brief points out, the court of claims

But I think that

But the overall impression is it was still

8

­­ at the end of the day, it was still applying to

9

offenses, that is, crimes.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that goes for the

11

government as ­­ I mean, suppose the government, not a

12

relator, brings a False Claims case against a

13

contractor.

14

under your view, the government doesn't get the

15

suspension?

The government wouldn't get the ­­ the ­­

16

MR. ELWOOD:

17

the wartime suspension.

18

specific three­year tolling provision, or three­year

19

discovery period, under the False Claims Act itself.

20

And a couple other notes that I think are

That's right.

It doesn't get

It would, however, get the

21

worthwhile.

22

fact that the Solicitor General said in 1959, at a time

23

when it had been litigating these cases continuously,

24

that it was subject to criminal laws only.

25

it's also significant that the officer created by the

I mean, we've already said a lot about the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

But I think

Official

1

Settlement Contract Act, or the Office of Contract

2

Settlements, said in 1947 that this tolling provision

3

only applied to crimes.

4

because, I mean, it was within ­­ I'm not saying it's a

5

Chevron deference thing, but it was within their duty.

6

As the government points out, they had to investigate

7

and report it to the government to do what they will

8

with it.

9

know whether that's subject to tolling or not when

And I think that's significant

But the end result of it was that you have to

10

you're deciding how to prioritize what you're going to

11

be investigating and reporting.

12

I think one final thing, and then I'll move

13

on to the other element, or the other error that the

14

court made, was that neighboring provisions in Title 18

15

simply wouldn't make sense if "offense" also applied to

16

violations of the civil laws.

17

3282(a), it says, "No person may be tried for an offense

18

unless indicted within five years of when the offense

19

arose."

20

without being indicted within five years.

21

Cowart v. Nichols that is, you know, something the Court

22

takes into consideration in trying to determine the

23

meaning of something.

24
25

Like, for example,

And, obviously, you can be tried for a civil crime

we get to the second?

11

if you were right on the first?

12

And how would we if we believe ­­

MR. ELWOOD:

Well, you should, because among

13

other things it will take care of, on remand the Court

14

won't have to address the equitable tolling argument

15

that we think is waived and also meritless.

16

And also, of course, there is the same issue

17

already behind us in the Purdue Pharma case, and in the

18

Shea case as well.

19

­­ I ­­ it would be the most efficient thing to do.

20

I think it will be ­­ it

21

if we won on the wartime suspension grounds.

22

And so I think the Court may as well
But

would be a complete remedy on us

Now, the second error that the court below

23

made was to ­­ well, if Congress had meant the

confusing between the two ­­ between the two actions.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Or "said action" or "that

MR. ELWOOD:

Yeah.

But I think under each

23

of the parties here, it could have been written better

24

to follow up, you know, what ­­ to embody the reading

25

that we want to give it.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But I think that ours is the one that makes

2

the most sense, because if you just look at the

3

provision from the moment when the bar arises, it makes

4

perfect sense.

5

And ­­

6

It is the pending action at that point.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, aren't you going

7

to ­­ besides the problem that you're ­­ you're talking

8

, your’re not giving "pending" any meaning, you're

9

also destroying the force of an original source.

I

10

mean, the ­­ the public disclosure bar doesn't apply to

11

an original source.

12

original sources from bringing suits, when a prior case

13

involved a dismissal for a technicality, or a dismissal

14

because this was in the public domain.

15

true for an original source.

16

MR. ELWOOD:

And you're sort of blocking

Right.

But that's not

But I think ­­ to begin

17

with, there's nothing in the public disclosure bar that

18

suggests that it was supposed to prevent the original

19

source from being subject to all of the other bars that

20

are out ­­ are out there still, like the ­­ you know,

21

like the government knowledge bar that still exists in a

22

tiny little corner, or the first­to­file bar.

23

And original source makes a lot of sense for

24

public disclosure, but it doesn't make any sense for

25

first­to­file for this reason:

When it's public

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

disclosure, when it's something that's said in a

2

committee report, you have no idea whether or not it's

3

gotten to

4

who needs ­­ needs to know about it,

5

for something to be done about it.

6

they not only

And first­to­file, however,

they have to file an action in

7

district court, and they have to give all the material

8

evidence they have to the Attorney General of the

9

United States, who is under a statutory obligation to

10

investigate it and who has to decide whether to

11

intervene or not.

12

Now, that is something that guarantees that,

13

you know, by hook or by crook, somebody at the Justice

14

Department with responsibility for these things knows it

15

and has the information that they need to take action on

16

this.

17

a lot of sense for you to be able to just keep coming

18

into court and filing a lawsuit telling the government,

hey, you know that stuff that you already know?

tell it to you again.

And after you've done that once, it doesn't make

is related to that would be barred.

3

I'd like to get back to Justice Ginsburg's

4

hypothetical because it's an important one, and that is

5

if somebody files ­­ the relator says, oh, well,

6

somebody files a terrible complaint, it's going to bar

7

all the good ones.

8

because they're going to compare, under that test, the

9

same material of facts test, you compare.

And I don't think that's the case

And if this

10

one just says KBR is bad, they commit a lot of fraud,

11

and this one says at these three camps they were

12

requiring people to build 12 hours a day, 84 hours a

13

week regardless of how much they ­­ they worked, those

14

aren't the same material facts and you get the

protection that way.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that first file

well, one aspect of it is the first filer doesn't have

to worry about a race to judgment.

second and gets the judgment first.

21

Somebody else files

So I thought that that was ­­ one of the

22

chief things was to protect the first filer and also to

23

protect that filer's recovery so he doesn't have to

24

split up whatever the qui tam plaintiff gets.

25

MR. ELWOOD:

The phrase "race to judgment"

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is not anything that I have found in the courts of

2

appeals.

3

I think that the court says that they want to create ­­

4

the first­to­file bar was meant to create a race to the

5

courthouse, not a race to judgment.

6
7

I've only found it in the government's brief.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And ­­

The first filer is a race

to the courthouse.

8

MR. ELWOOD:

9

race to the courthouse.

Yes.

It's meant to create a

And there's less of an

10

incentive to race to the courthouse under the relator's

11

rule because even if you aren't the first to file, you

12

can still bring a claim; you've just got to wait for a

13

break in the traffic to jump in.

14

if you are the first to file, you don't even get a

15

better settlement because when, you know, most of these

16

cases are settled, they aren't litigated to judgment.

17

And a defendant is not going to give you, you know,

18

everything you're asking for if they know that they're

19

going to have to settle this case again and again and

20

again.

21

you would be a fool to settle it right away because it

22

just means more people are going to be able to sue you.

23

And under that, you ­­

And, in fact, it discourages settlements because

The relator's rule is as many lawsuits as

24

you can fit into 6 years or 10 years or an infinite

25

period of time because, you know, there ­­ there's

nothing particular to stop them.

rule, you have much more of an incentive to settle and

3

settle for the full amount, because by settling with

that first relator, you are buying peace with respect to

all related lawsuits.

complete sense and it is a pending action.

12

a reason for doing that.

13

9A, this is the mirror image.

14

(b)(5) is the mirror image of the language used to

15

create the cause of action in (b)(1).

16

(b)(1), a person may bring a civil action for violation

17

of Section 3729, and then you find out what happens when

18

they do that and the bar arises.

19

brings an action under this subsection for that

20

violation of 3729, no person other than the government

21

may bring a related action.

parallelism between a person may bring and no person may

bring, which suggests that you look at it then going

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When Congress enacted the 1942 version of

5

against the backdrop of this Court's 1921 decision in

6

United States v. Hutto.

7

construing the general Federal criminal conspiracy

8

statute.

9

things, to conspire to commit an offense against the

And the Court in Hutto was

And that statute made it a crime, among other

10

United States.

11

whether that criminal statute covered conspiracies to

12

commit civil violations.

13

And the question before the Court was

And the Court held that it did.

The Court

14

held that there was no necessity in the statute for the

15

offense, the object of which is the conspiracy, to be a

16

criminal offense, and that the criminal statute could be

17

violated by a conspiracy to commit a civil wrong.

18

And there are certainly a great many

19

provisions in Title 18 that use the word "offense" in

20

which there are other contextual clues within the

21

provision that make clear that only crimes are covered.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there ­­ is there a

23

provision that uses the word "offense" even though it

24

may be civil, where that word "offense" in that

25

provision refers to something other than a criminal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

3
4

offense?
MR. STEWART:
offense.

Not other than a criminal

As Mr. Stone has ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Every use of the word

5

"offense" in Title 18 is in reference to a criminal

6

offense.

7
8
9

MR. STEWART:

It refers to conduct with

criminal ­­ that ­­ to which criminal penalties attach.
As Mr. Stone was explaining, there are

10

provisions in Title 18 that use the word "offense" to

11

describe conduct that is subject to both criminal and

12

civil sanctions; and those are criminal offenses.

13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the answer to my

question was yes?

15

MR. STEWART:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. STEWART:

They are still crimes, yes.
Yes.
But what we would say about

18

3287 is the word "offense" is being used something in

19

the same way, as a hybrid.

20

current version of the WSLA does cover crimes.

21

the limitations period for criminal prosecutions, but it

22

also applies to civil offenses.

23

There is no dispute that the
It tolls

That ­­ the next thing I would ask the Court

24

to look at is on page 1A of the government's brief.

25

We've reproduced the original 1942 version of the

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act.
And the provision begins:

"The running of

3

any existing statute of limitations applicable to

4

offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud

5

the United States or any agency thereof, whether by a

6

conspiracy or not, and in any manner, and now indictable

7

under any existing statutes."

8
9

And if you look even to the rest of that
provision, the only clear evidence you would find that

10

this version of the statute was limited to crimes was

11

the phrase "now indictable."

12

Now, it's possible that the phrase "now

13

indictable" did other work as well; but it was the only

14

language in the statute that limited the provision to

15

crimes.

16

And so part ­­ part of the questioning by

17

the Court, understandably, has been to the effect of, if

18

Congress meant to change this in 1944, why didn't it do

19

something more direct to manifest that intent?

20

And part of our point is, in some sense,

21

removal of "now indictable" is indirect, but in some

22

sense removing the only language that previously limited

23

the ­­ the provision to crimes is the most way ­­ direct

24

way to go about it.

25

If the statute had originally ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, whoa, whoa.

51
Alderson Reporting Company

You can

Official

1

say that it limited it or you can say that it ­­ it

2

showed ­­ it showed that the word "offense" in that

3

statute was being used to mean a criminal offense,

4

right?

5

MR. STEWART:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think ­­
It could.

I acknowledge

7

that sometimes you can say "offense" and it means civil,

8

sometimes you can say that it means criminal, and

9

sometimes you can say it means both.

10

But what that language did in the original

11

statute was to make it clear that the word "offense" in

12

this statute was being used in a criminal sense.

13

don't think that that implication is eliminated by

14

simply taking out the ­­ taking out the "now indictable"

15

language, which could have been eliminated for a very

16

different reason; and that is, to show that it ­­ it

17

operates prospectively.

18

MR. STEWART:

And I

I guess part of the point I

19

would make is if the initial version of the statute had

20

referred to existing ­­ statutes of limitations on

21

criminal offenses and Congress had then excised the word

22

"criminal," we would say ­­ I think that would be viewed

23

as very powerful evidence that Congress intended an

24

expansion.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But there would be no other

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reason for eliminating the word "criminal"; whereas,

2

there is a very good other reason for eliminating the

3

phrase "now indictable."

4

MR. STEWART:

Well, the reason that has been

5

postulated is that "now indictable" originally served

6

the purpose of making clear that the WSLA would not

7

revive expired prosecutions, and that this was no longer

8

necessary in 1944 because the statute was amended to

9

make that point clear separately.

10

But, in fact, the 1942 version of the

11

statute said:

12

13

Mr. Stewart, before your

namely, if there is a dismissal of ­­ on the merits of

17

MR. STEWART:

Yes, we would think we would

18

be barred.

19

1986 and that's the understanding of the statute that

20

we've been operating under; that is, our protection

21

under the statute is that when a qui tam suit is filed,

22

we have an initial opportunity to decide whether to

23

intervene or not.

24

intervene, we can move later to intervene for good cause

25

shown and so if we initially think the relator can do a

We think that was Congress's expectation in

Even if we initially decide not to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

capable job but then we decide later, no, he can't, our

2

protection against the claim being badly litigated is

3

that we can take over the suit, and if we don't avail

4

ourselves of that protection and the case is decided

5

against us on the merits, then claim preclusion would

6

apply.

7

And I think in Taylor v. Sturgell, the Court

8

identified a number of categories of cases in which

9

nonparties can be barred in subsequent litigation.

One

10

of them is when a litigant allows his claim to be

11

litigated by a representative, and the Court in Stevens

12

described qui tam suits as a species of representational

13

standing.

14

And I think the same principle would apply

15

to a suit brought by a second relator as well, that is

16

an additional category of nonparty preclusion that the

17

Court in Stevens ­­ I'm sorry, that the Court in

18

Taylor v. Sturgell identified was that when one party is

19

barred from litigating himself, he can't relitigate the

20

same claim through a proxy.

21

would be barred by the judgment in the first qui tam

22

suit from filing its own suit, then to allow a second

23

relator to go forward on the same claim would, in

24

essence, be allowing the United States to relitigate

25

through a proxy.

And if the United States

16

rule is that if the first suit is ultimately dismissed,

17

then the second suit proceeds as though nothing had

18

happened.

19

Court may look at page 5a of the brief, which reproduces

20

the current version of the public disclosure bar, and it

21

says, this is about halfway down the page:

22

23

unless opposed by the government, if substantially the

24

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD

MR. ELWOOD:

Mr. Stewart said that the only

13

language in the provision in the Wartime Suspension of

14

Limitations Act which limited it to criminal ­­ limited

it to crimes, was the phrase "now indictable, and I

19

It's very telling that 47 days after enacting the

20

Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act which used

21

"offense" to apply only to crimes, it said "any

22

violation which is now indictable or subject to a civil

23

proceeding."

24

was limiting it to crimes, not the word ­­ not "now

cited, a five­page opinion that relied heavily on the

6

1893 case of Pettibone, which has said there can be
