ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. MENENDEZ:

Good morning, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
The residual clause of the violent felony

13

definition of the Armed Career Criminal Act is

14

unconstitutionally vague because its text and structure

15

do not set out with clarity what predicate offenses fall

16

within its coverage and what do not.

17

proven by this Court's inability after repeated efforts

18

to discern a meaningful and replicable interpretive

19

framework that will guide lower courts.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Its vagueness is

Ms. Menendez, just to

21

clarify, you are contesting only the residual clause,

22

not the rest of the statute.

23

with ­­ it lists burglary, arson or extortion or

24

involves the use of explosives, you're not attacking any

25

of that.

So if the statute ending

It's just the residual clause; is that

Alderson Reporting Company

correct?

2

MS. MENENDEZ:

3

And we believe, in fact, that the other

That is correct, Your Honor.

4

portions of this statute shed some light onto why the

5

residual clause is unconstitutionally vague.

6

instance, the other portions of the definition tie

7

qualification for violent felony status directly to the

8

elements of the offense in question.

9

For

The force clause requires that the use of

10

force or the attempted use of force be an element of the

11

offense.

12

explosives that Your Honor references are determined by

13

reference to the elements of the offense.

14

analysis.

15

The burglary, arson, extortion, and use of

JUSTICE ALITO:

A categorical

Now, I know that we are ­­

16

asked you to argue this vagueness issue, but when you

17

were here before, you didn't think that the statute was

19

argument was it's clear that your client did not fall

20

within the residual clause, largely because he was

21

convicted.

22

offense, and you argue that none of the specific

23

offenses listed is ­­ is a possession offense.

24
25

As I remember, your

The offense that's at issue is a possession

MS. MENENDEZ:

You're correct, Your Honor,

that when ­­ when we were here last time, we argued that

Alderson Reporting Company

it is plainly not included for the reasons you mention

2

as well as others.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if it's not plainly

4

included, why do we have to get to this issue at all?

5

Why should we reach out to decide a constitutional

6

question?

7

MS. MENENDEZ:

Certainly, Your Honor.

The

8

fact that we believe it's clearly excluded seems to be

9

at odds at the opinion ­­ of the opinion of the

10

Solicitor General in the United States, the Eighth

11

Circuit Court of Appeals and other courts.

12

that something that seems obviously not to fall within

13

the plain definition but is still held to fall within

14

the plain definition by numerous courts reveals the

15

vagueness of the residual clause.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

The fact

But we get ­­ almost every

17

case that comes here involves a dispute among the lower

18

courts about what something means, about what the

19

constitutional rule is or what the statutory

20

interpretation should be.

21

So the mere fact that there's disagreement

22

about this, that shows that it's unconstitutionally

23

vague?

24

MS. MENENDEZ:

25

disagreement, Your Honor.

This goes far beyond mere
I can think of no other

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6

instance in which the Court has endeavored so many times

2

in so few years to answer precisely the same question,

3

not merely interpreting the same 14 words, but asking

4

each time whether a single offense satisfies those 14

5

words.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

In ­­ in James, in 2007, we

7

held that the residual clause ­­ we said the residual

8

clause is not unconstitutionally vague.

9

2011, we reaffirmed that.

In Sykes, in

10

Can you give me other examples of instances

11

in which the Court has overruled a constitutional

12

holding that has been twice reaffirmed within a period

13

of 8 years?

14

Has that happened frequently?

MS. MENENDEZ:

Your Honor, I think ­­ I

15

don't have a case at the ready for that question, but

16

what I can say is what doesn't happen frequently, is

17

that this Court has to grapple with such frequency and

18

is still unable to create an interpretive framework.

19

The heart of stare decisis is, in part, workability.

20

Precedent that remains workable and useful that applies

21

guidance to the lower court deserves greater deference.

22

And with due respect to this Court's understandable

23

hesitation to declare the statute unconstitutionally

24

vague, that precedent is simply proven not to be

25

workable.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, do you think the issue

Your Honor, that is not the
I don't know whether it's possible

10

for a statute to be rendered vague by poor

11

interpretation, but in this case the vagueness in here

12

is in the text and operation itself.

13

repeated efforts to discern a useful interpretive

14

framework haven't caused the vagueness, but they prove

15

the vagueness.

Suppose that you had a

maximum, that they would impose a greater sentence if

injury to another. Now, this is within their mandatory

questions.

I think first of all that more than the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, is there any example

17

that you can think of where that was a basis for holding

18

a statute unconstitutional?

19

MS. MENENDEZ:

Your Honor, in the vagueness

20

cases that we have cited, one of the things often

21

discussed by the Court is that it isn't amenable to a

22

useful interpretive framework, that it isn't being

23

consistently applied by lower courts.

24

But the second ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

I've never heard of that as

here, "serious risk" or "risk of physical harm."

fact, does agree upon?

11

some offenses which people just say, well, of course

that fits within the residual clause.

of thing that creates splits, it's not the kind of thing

14

that creates controversy, that there's a core of

15

agreement as to what it means and that all the trouble

16

is occurring on the margins.

17

MS. MENENDEZ:

In other words, that there are

It's not the kind

Your Honor, the margins here

18

are so much bigger than the core that even if we are

19

able to agree on a small number of things that might

clearly fall within the center, the fact is that the

vast majority ­­

What do you think is in the

core?

Your Honor, I think

kidnapping might be in the core.

A kidnapping that

Alderson Reporting Company

14
1

doesn't fall within the force clause, which many would

2

do, might be in the core.

3

But, Your Honor, I think what's more

4

instructive is the fact that so many things that the

5

government even suggested are easy cases ­­ the examples

6

that they give on pages 8 and 9 of their brief ­­ on

7

closer examination, they're not that easy.

8

child abuse.

9

circuits have held that child abuse counts, but the

For example,

Now it's true that one circuit or multiple

10

Spencer case, which examined a Florida statute of child

11

abuse, found that it didn't account.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The government says that to

13

declare a statute facially vague, all its applications

14

have to be facially vague.

15

contesting that standard because you're admitting that

16

at least one thing that you can think of, kidnapping,

17

that there ­­ that that application would be

18

appropriate; is that right?

19

MS. MENENDEZ:

And I guess you're

24

importantly, where everyone agreed that the conduct in

It comes from Flipside v. Hoffman Estates, which

but a mandatory one where Congress has acted to take

discretion away ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

with the government that so long as there is something

8

that is clearly within the core, it's not vague.

9

agree with that or disagree with that?

10
11
12

Well, you're not answering
The question is whether you agree

MS. MENENDEZ:
Your Honor.

Do you

I do not agree with that,

I think that that's unworkable.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose you could have a

13

statute that criminalized annoying conduct, right?

14

according to the government, that would not be

15

unconstitutional, because there's some stuff that is

16

clearly annoying, right?

17

MS. MENENDEZ:

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

And

Yes, Your Honor.

So that's a perfectly good

statute according to the government, yes?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do with all

22

of the statutes that are cited in the appendix in the

23

government's brief that they say uses such language as

24

"serious risk of physical injury to another," the same

25

words that are used here?

Except this says "potential."

Alderson Reporting Company

What do you ­­ the ­­ the government suggests that all

2

of those statutes would be vulnerable under your

3

reading.

4

MS. MENENDEZ:

Thank you, Your Honor.

5

The ­­ the term "serious risk" is not on trial here.

6

None of those with the, perhaps, possible exception, we

7

believe, of the two described on the first page come

8

even close in operation or function to what the residual

9

clause does.

In almost every one of those cases, it's

10

either part of a limiting definition, it's subject to an

11

additional limiting definition, or it's one of several

12

elements which help narrow the conduct.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Or ­­ or is it also that

14

in most of the statutes that were cited, it depends on

15

the facts of the particular case?

the categorical approach.

individual conduct, not an abstract imagination of

25

conduct, but actually what the defendant did constitutes

from being vague.

Why does that solve the

4

MS. MENENDEZ:

Because then litigants,

defendants and judges would only have to look at the

6

criminal code of the State that has the predicate

offense and see whether it has as an element the

8

creation of risk.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, an offense that

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Armed Career Criminal Act states, as

8

this Court noted in Sykes, a normative principle that

9

can be applied to various crimes with a methodology that

10

does not produce unconstitutional vagueness.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

anything like that in Begay.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, we didn't say

I think the Court didn't

14

volunteer an opinion about the vagueness of the statute

15

in Begay.

16

that it was not unconstitutional.

17

after Begay, and the Court continued to adhere to the

18

idea that this statute can be applied as it has been

19

applied four times by the Court and in numerous

20

instances by lower courts without substantial

21

difficulty.

It did comment on that in James, and it said

22

Now, I'm not ­­

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sykes came later

I didn't mean to

24

suggest in Begay we specifically addressed vagueness,

25

but the ­­ my ­­ my point was that Sykes provides a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

particular test, but as your friend has pointed out,

2

Begay, it seems to me, points in an entirely different

3

direction.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

What Begay did was conclude

5

that the similarity of the offenses in the residual

6

clause to the enumerated offenses had to be more than

7

just similarity of risk; it also had to have a certain

8

similarity in kind.

9

In Sykes, the Court noted that the phrase

10

that the Court developed in Begay, "purposeful, violent

11

and aggressive," wasn't precisely linked to the text of

12

the statute, and it made clear that for offenses with a

13

mens rea of knowingly or intentionally risk levels

14

ordinarily provide the manageable test that courts can

15

apply.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's true, but you see,

17

Begay sort of points to the problem in my mind.

18

is no doubt that drunk driving does cause a risk of

19

physical injury.

20

wanted to impose a 15­year mandatory minimum penalty to

21

a person who has two drunk driving offenses prior?

22

seemed outside the ballpark of what they're actually

23

interested in, and that's why I've had such a hard time,

24

I think we've had such a hard time with this in part

25

because of the sentence ­­ you know, a 15­year mandatory

There

2

had something in mind, but it's very hard to figure out.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

So I think, Justice Breyer,

4

that it may have been a little bit too ambitious for the

5

Court to try to develop a similarity­in­kind test

6

from ­­

That was the position of the government; four Justices

­­ and concluded that it was

17

better to restrict it to crimes that involved

19

so as not to allow it to basically subsume what's in the

20

statute.

21

has given guidance to the lower courts, there has been

22

some confusion that the Court, in its opinion in this

23

case, could clear up about the relationship between

Begay and the risk test.

25

And I think that having done that, the Court

it has to be Congress that's done that.

It's engaged in statutory construction about

Now, if the Court believes that a

16

similar­in­kind limitation is appropriate for ACCA,

17

there actually is a textual vehicle for getting there.

that are caused by regulatory type violations, like

4

pollution, and injuries that are caused in the way that

5

the statute specifies.

6

And I want to remind the Court that eight members of the

police officer in its ordinary case was sufficiently

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, let me add one thing,

4

Justice Kagan, to your description of what courts should

5

do when they apply this analysis.

6

to look to see if they can identify the ordinary case.

7

Then they're going to try to determine whether the risk

is essentially, I think, analogous to the burglary

I want Your Honor to think about in this context:

15

the Court is not satisfied that on any one of those

issues, the government loses.

is vague, but because if the Court is not confident that

an offense fits within the ­­ a normative criteria that

Congress has established, the tie goes to the defendant.

keep a perspective here that the idea of substantial

The very

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That ­­ that brings me to

12

the statutes in your appendix.

13

to me that those statutes do require a case­by­case

14

determination by the finder of fact that there was a

15

danger in the particular case.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So there ­­

that's different from ­­

MR. DREEBEN:

It depends on the rationale,

2

Justice Kennedy, because if the rationale were the

3

concept of substantial risk is itself too amorphous to

4

be grasped at all and to be applied in any kind of a

5

consistent manner, I think that would raise serious

6

questions.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

We would never say that.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

We would never say that.

But I think as a logical

10

matter, that's essentially what Petitioner is saying,

11

that it's not possible to really get a fix on what those

12

words mean.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

He's saying ­­ she's

14

saying that you can't tell what the typical crime is,

15

and when you can't tell what the typical crime is, you

16

can't tell what ­­ what ­­ what the risk is.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And my answer to that is ­­

MR. DREEBEN:

8

That sounds wonderful, but the fact is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are we going to have to

review every one of these until the law is clear?

9

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

I think the Court does

10

what it typically does, which is to review cases and

11

establish general principles, and the lower courts make

12

an effort to harmonize their rulings in light of them.

13

It's not unique that this statute has

14

generated a lot of litigation.

15

example, this Court has had three different cases

16

interpreting the meaning of the word "use" and one

17

interpreting the word "carry."

18

ratio of cases to words than this statute, but I think

19

what it says is that when there's a lot at stake, when

20

many years of prison time are at stake, people litigate

21

hard.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Section 924(c), for

I mean, that's a higher

Is the test the same here

23

for vagueness as when we're determining the validity of

24

a statute that specifies a crime?

25

MR. DREEBEN:

So I don't think that's so

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

clear, Justice Kennedy.

2

that there's a lesser degree of ­­ of clarity required

3

for vagueness doctrine in the sentencing context.

4

This Court in Chapman indicated

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why should that be when

5

it's a mandatory ­­ this is mandatory, and has

6

five years, no possibility ­­ and this case is such a

7

good illustration because the judge said, If it were up

to me, this person should get half or most ­­ what did

9

he say ­­ two­thirds, that would more than suffice, but

10
11

I'm locked into this by ACCA.
Shouldn't we demand from Congress, if it

12

wants to have that kind of enhancement, a really clear

13

statement?

14

MR. DREEBEN:

15

that, Justice Ginsburg.

16

involves recidivism.

17

any question that Petitioner should have had about what

18

conduct was prohibited and not prohibited.

19

should have known that he could not possess a gun.

20

And the second thing is because this statute

to be sufficient to meet whatever heightened standard

25

the Court might impose on it.

Alderson Reporting Company

58

But I do want to come back ­­

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Before you do,

3

just ­­ because I disagree with the statement you made.

4

You said if there's ­­ because there are so

5

many years involved, people will litigate hard.

6

because there are so many years involved, people won't

7

litigate at all.

8

when ­­ if they go to trial such a large enhancement, I

9

think they're going to be compelled ­­ it gives so much

I think

I mean, if ­­ if they're facing

10

more power to the prosecutor in the plea negotiations

11

which is, of course, where almost all of the cases are

12

disposed of.

MR. DREEBEN:

And not so much here for two

16

not going to say that there are no contested cases, but

17

it's not the hardest crime to prove.

One is that section 922(g)

the defendant's criminal history, and the judge is

applicable.

The presentence report will indicate

So I don't think that this context presents

quite the same plea bargaining pressure that Your Honor

2

had in mind.

3

But ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How is the government

Thank you, counsel.

Ms. Menendez, you

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE M. MENENDEZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. MENENDEZ:
Chief Justice.

Thank you, Your Honor, Mr.

Just briefly, Your Honor.

First, I think lenity is an illusory
solution in this case.

After the government suggested

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

60
1

lenity is the answer, we looked through every opinion we

2

could find from the courts of appeals and the district

3

court.

4

court has applied lenity to find that a marginal case

5

should not count under the residual clause.

6

lenity is going to pose the solution that the government

7

suggests, it needs substantial invigoration by this

8

Court to be the ­­ the answer in the gray areas.

9

The second thought is that this suggestion

We did not find a single case nationwide where a

So if

10

that the Court can decide what the ordinary case is from

11

reported decisions is actually also skewed in favor of

12

the government.

13

offense where somebody commits a much less egregious

14

case; resisting arrest where all they do is refused to

15

be handcuffed versus resisting arrest where they kick

16

and punch and fight the officer.

17

get a higher sentence and more likely to lead to appeals

18

and challenges and a reported decision.

19

perhaps more likely to be resolved with a suspended

20

sentence and never to appear in the reported case law at

21

all.

22

Consider a ­­ consider a standard

This case is likely to

This case is

So if all we're doing is turning to the

23

reported case law to try to determine what the ordinary

24

case is, that's going to give an artificially skewed

25

sense of the aggressive nature of those cases.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

61
1

Finally, Your Honors, while it's true that

2

this Court has grappled with things like 924(c)

3

repeatedly, 924(c) provides an example of what's

4

supposed to happen, which is when this Court points out

5

a flaw in a statute, which they have ­­ Your Honors have

6

now done four different times, Congress answered.

7

Change 924(c) to try to address the Court's decision and

8

address the Court's concerns from Bailey.

9

answer has led to additional questions.

10

And then that

That give and take, that discourse is

11

missing in this case, where it's been clear for a long

12

time that this statute needs help, and there's been

13

inaction on the part of Congress.

14

that the idea that the tie should go to the defendant is

15

important, but it's just not happening, because of the

16

subjective gut check that Your Honor has mentioned.

17

Your Honors, I think

Judges substitute a feeling, boy, a sexual

18

offense involving a minor sounds bad, and it sounds

19

violent, so therefore, it must count.

20

Your Honors to look at the footnote in our brief where

21

we highlight that there's actually several cases that

22

find that where the offense is ­­ or is unlawful because

23

of the age of the victim, it doesn't count as a violent

24

offense.

25

more quantified, it has to be limited, it has to have

But I'd invite

So that gut check has to mean ­­ has to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

62

2

specific guidance.
The last point I'd like to make, Your

3

Honors, is that whether this Court decides in favor of

4

Mr. Johnson on the merits or an application of the Rule

5

of Lenity, whether this Court decides that this statute

6

is unconstitutionally vague as applied to possessory

7

offenses, or as applied to mere possession of a

8

short­barrel shotgun, or whether this Court takes the

9

step that I think it's time for, and declares this

10

clause unconstitutionally vague, in every instance, I

11

think the appropriate result is for Mr. Johnson to win

12

and be resentenced.

13

Thank you.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15
16
17

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
