ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. BRASHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BRASHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The 4­R Act does not make railroads the most

12

favored taxpayers.

13

carriers, shippers and the general public.

14

in this case does balance those interests and CSX's

15

position does not.

16

think the rules is this, and that's that courts should

17

compare the taxation of railroads to the taxation of the

18

mass of other businesses in the State with a focus on

19

whether a State is targeting or singling out railroads

20

for a tax that the general mass of other businesses do

21

not have to pay.

22

It instead balances the needs of
Our position

On the comparison class issue, we

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it said that ­­ it

23

said that in ­­ in (b)(1), and it doesn't say that in

24

(b)(4).

25

MR. BRASHER:

Right.

I ­­ but I think ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Another tax that

2

discriminates is all it says, whereas in (1) it said "as

3

R value" ­­ "then the ratio that the assessed value of

4

other commercial and industrial property in the same

5

assessment jurisdiction."

6

MR. BRASHER:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well ­­
They're so specific there

8

and ­­ and in (4) they just say another tax that

9

discriminates against the rail carrier.

10

MR. BRASHER:

But I think the question is

11

whether there's any reason to read (b)(4) to require a

12

comparison class that is different than the one in

13

(b) ­­ (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3).

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yeah.

There's a good

15

reason that they didn't spell out a specific comparison

16

class.

17

MR. BRASHER:

Well, I don't think that ­­

18

that is a sufficient reason because I think that the

19

comparison class that is spelled out in (b)(1), (b)(2),

20

and (b)(3), if you apply it in (b)(4), it ensures that

21

railroads are being treated fairly by tying them to a

22

broad enough mass of politically influential taxpayers

23

to keep their rates fair.

24

that ­­

25

the text of the statute.

And the competitor class here

CSX has proposed makes very little sense in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

I mean, it also, it doesn't really make

2

sense in light of what this Court said in CSX 1 where

3

the Court said that, at the very least, we should be

4

looking at similarly situated taxpayers.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, General, I think on ­­

6

on this question, CSX 1, I think your reasoning flies

7

straight into the face of it, because CSX 1 talks about

8

the notion that (1) through (3) is very different from

9

(4) and that you can't ­­ this is just along the lines

10

of what Justice Scalia says ­­ that you can't draw

11

anything about the meaning of (4) from (1) through (3)

12

given that they clearly ­­ they use different language,

13

they're directed towards different things.

14

MR. BRASHER:

Well, I think ­­ I think the

15

question here is ­­ is whether you should be looking at

16

general businesses or whether you should be looking at

17

CSX's handpicked class of competitors.

18

textual argument that that's the only thing that the

19

text provides for.

20

And we made the

But I also think ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why ­­ why do you

21

say handpicked?

22

transporting goods, motor carriers are and railroads

23

are.

24
25

I ­­ I ­­ they're in the business of

MR. BRASHER:

Well, because in this

particular situation, CSX is comparing itself to motor

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

carriers and water carriers, but is not comparing itself

2

to, for example, airlines or pipelines, which also

3

compete with respect to CSX in transportation.

4

But I think ­­ I think there's no reason to

5

necessarily presume that competitors are similarly

6

situated, especially for the purposes of State taxation.

7

I mean, Amazon and Walmart are competitors, but for

8

State taxation, they are not similarly situated.

9
10
11
12
13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if they're not

similarly situated, then the railroad loses.
MR. BRASHER:

That's right.

And I think ­­

I think for the purposes of this tax ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's a

14

different question than saying what class they should be

15

compared to.

16

MR. BRASHER:

I don't think so.

Because I

17

think ­­ I think the question is ­­ is ­­ at the very

18

least, the question is what the comparison class should

19

be, and I think that CSX tells us at the very least,

20

they should be similarly situated to.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, you see, when you say

22

"similarly situated," and I think that's right, but that

23

seems to go to your second argument, which is, look,

24

they're not similarly situated because there's another

25

tax that falls upon motor carriers that doesn't fall

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

upon railroads, and that seems to me completely fair

2

and ­­ but ­­ but not on the first question.

3

MR. BRASHER:

Well, let me ­­ let me explain

4

briefly on how I think it does go to the first question,

5

which is that we're talking about a sales and use tax,

6

which is a tax on a transaction.

7

transaction for the purchase of tangible property.

8

so the comparison class here should at least include the

9

many businesses that also pay that tax

It's a tax on a
And

on the items

10

that they buy for their business.

11

more similarly situated to their competitors than they

12

are to every other business in the State that is also

13

paying the tax when it buys items that it needs for its

14

business.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And railroads are no

But the problem is that,

16

generally, one thinks of sales and use taxes as flip

17

sides of each other.

18

comparison is not quite similar.

19

measures what you buy, whether you use the gas in State

20

or out of State, and the other meant ­­ measures only

21

what you use in Alabama.

22

the comparison that's not the norm.

23

MR. BRASHER:

But here, the basis of a
Because in one it

So there is a dissimilarity in

Right.

So ­­ so if you put

24

the comparison class issue aside and you look at the

25

comparison of the ­­ of the tax that the railroads pay and

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the tax that the truckers pay, I think that they are

2

comparable in the sense that ­­ that those are the taxes

3

that they pay on diesel fuel.

4

really in two ways.

5

taxes that ­­ that both of these entities are paying on

6

diesel.

7

And they're comparable

As a practical matter, they are the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The circuit below said

8

that was fortuitous and that at some point that could

9

change.

10

MR. BRASHER:

Well, I'm saying that as a

11

practical matter, they're ­­ they're the taxes that are

12

paid by these entities on diesel.

13

matter, the exemption that Alabama is providing to the

14

truckers is because they are paying the other tax on the

15

same gallon of diesel.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

And as a legal

On the ­­ on the comparator

17

issue, suppose that railroads and trucks used exactly

18

the same fuel all the time, no difference whatsoever,

19

and suppose that Alabama taxed the fuel purchased by the

20

railroads but not by the trucks.

21

violation then?

22

MR. BRASHER:

Would there be a

Our position would be that,

23

no, there would not be a violation on the comparison

24

class issue as long as the general mass of businesses

25

are still paying the same tax rate.

Alderson Reporting Company

And the ­­ and the

Official

9
1

reason I say that is because if you link the railroad's

2

taxation to the general mass of other businesses in the

3

State, then they're not paying an unfair tax rate.

4
5
6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that result is

consistent with the purpose of this statute?
MR. BRASHER:

Yes.

And ­­ and the reason I

7

say that is because the 4­R Act was an omnibus bill.

8

did many things.

9

$2 billion for ­­ for subsidies to the railroad

It

It, for example, appropriated almost

10

industry.

11

Congress was getting at was it was trying to prevent

12

States from singling out or targeting railroads for

13

taxes, which, quite frankly, States have been doing for

14

years.

15

trying to prevent and that is a harm that would be

16

prevented if you used the general class ­­

17

But with this particular provision, what

And so that was the harm that Congress was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but they wanted

18

to prop up ­­ they wanted to support the rail industry

19

in a number of ways.

20

a situation where they were giving them this much money,

21

they still wanted to expose them to unfair competition

22

by States that want to give other modes of

23

transportation a tax benefit, but not to them.

And it seems odd to say in a ­­ in

2

they're faring with respect to their competitors, not

3

how they're, you know, faring with respect to, you know,

4

5

MR. BRASHER:

Well, ultimately, railroads

6

are competing against other railroads.

7

MR. BRASHER:

compete, but to a certain extent they're also

13

complementary forms of transportation.

15

the railroads couldn't exist without truckers.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

opinion?

21

MR. BRASHER:

No.

I ­­ I think the

13

thing is to think, we know you're clever, State tax

14

authorities, and you'll figure out a million ways to do

15

this, but if whatever way you figure out discriminates

16

against the railroads, you lose.

We're

Mr. Brasher, what ­­ what's

It's ­­ it's a wagon that

uses kerosene to deliver ice cream.
MR. BRASHER:

But I think ­­ I think the

21

main point here is that there are lots of businesses in

22

Alabama that are paying the sales tax on the items that

23

they need for their business, and there are also lots of

24

businesses that are paying the sales tax on the diesel

25

fuel when they need diesel fuel for their businesses.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

So manufacturers, mining companies, construction

2

companies, timber companies, those businesses are the

3

kinds of businesses that the railroads should be

4

compared to because that prevents them from being

5

treated unfairly.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

On the question of diesel

7

fuel, I ­­ I got the impression ­­ this just an

8

informational question ­­ but I got the impression from

9

briefs that diesel fuel is diesel fuel except some of it

10

is dyed.

11

case that the dyed diesel fuel has a higher sulfur

12

content than the clear diesel fuel and therefore costs

13

less?

14

But is that ­­ is that true?

MR. BRASHER:

Is it not the

It's my understanding that

15

they are chemically the same.

16

that the only difference between clear diesel fuel and

17

dyed diesel fuel is that dyed diesel fuel is diesel fuel

18

that has been indelibly dyed.

19

that they are chemically the same.

20

That ­­ that the law is

So it's my understanding

It could be that the United States

21

government regulates those uses differently through some

22

kind of environmental regulation, but I'm not

23

aware of that.

24
25

But I think ­­ I think what the ­­ setting
the comparison class issue aside, what the district

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

court did here is exactly what this Court told it to do

2

when the Court remanded in ­­ in CSX 1, and that's it

3

looked at our justifications, it found that they had

4

nothing to do with railroads, and it also found that the

5

railroads weren't practically disadvantaged by the kind

6

of treatment that they were getting and they weren't

7

practically disadvantaged with respect to truckers,

8

because the truckers are paying a higher tax on the

9

years at issue here.

And the railroads could pay that

10

tax ultimately if they wanted to, but they don't want to

11

because they realize that they're actually paying a

12

lower tax rate on their diesel.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, one of the things

14

that Mr. Phillips talks about is he ­­ he makes the

15

point that this is a very hard inquiry to carry out and

16

that the experience of courts, when they try to do this

17

in commerce cases, shows that.

18

that?

19

MR. BRASHER:

So what's your answer to

Well, the ­­ the inquiry that

20

we're asking the Court to perform is not difficult at

21

all, and the district court performed it in one

22

paragraph of its decision, which is you simply compare

23

the taxes that we are imposing on diesel fuel for the

24

truckers versus the taxes that the railroads are paying

25

on the same item.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

And this is inherent in CSX's complaint in

2

this case where CSX is asking the courts to compare its

3

taxes that it is paying on diesel fuel to the taxes that

4

its competitors are paying on diesel fuel.

5

inconsistent for CSX to be arguing that that's the

6

comparison and inquiry the courts should make, but at

7

the same time, courts can't make that inquiry.

8
9

And so it's

And once again, as ­­ as a purely legal
matter, the tax exemption that we're talking about here

10

is

11

that the truckers have to pay.

12

it says if you pay the tax on clear diesel ­­ if you pay

13

the fuels tax that Alabama imposes, then you don't pay

14

any other tax imposed by State law.

15

legal matter ­­

16

in the same part of the code that imposes the tax

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the exemption reads,

And so, as a purely

You're ­­ you ­­ are you

representing on the behalf of the State that the

18

railroads could pay the motor vehicle tax ­­

19

MR. BRASHER:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. BRASHER:

Yes.
­­ if they chose?
Yes.

And that was our

22

position in this Court in 2009 and it's ­­ it's a clear

23

reading of Alabama law because the reason the truckers

24

are getting the exemption is because they're paying the

25

other tax.

reasons?

It's not for environmental

Are you sure about that?

MR. BRASHER:

I don't think so.

I mean,

5

it's certainly the way this ­­ certainly the way this

6

started is ­­ is we started with a taxing scheme that

7

required truckers to pay what ­­ what at the time, at

8

least, was much, much higher than railroads were paying.

9

And so we wanted to prevent truckers from using the dyed

10
11

diesel.
The whole reason why we have clear diesel

12

and dyed diesel to begin with is ­­ is so that we could

13

support this taxing scheme where we're imposing a

14

per­gallon tax on the truckers.

15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, talk about the

water carriers.

17

MR. BRASHER:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
Are you going to suggest

19

that if they stop at a dock and eat a meal, they can't

20

be charged a sales tax?

21

MR. BRASHER:

Well, I think the district

22

court said two things about water carriers and neither

23

one makes sense, which is that the railroads didn't show

24

any practical disadvantage with respect to water

25

carriers because the only evidence in the record with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

respect to water carriers is that they make up 1 percent

2

of the market for shipping goods from one part of

3

Alabama to another.

4

And ­­ and to go back to the complementary

5

point that I was making earlier, the district court

6

also, quite rightly, refused to simply assume that

7

treating water carriers with this minor preference was

8

going to harm railroad's bottom line, and this is why:

9

Is that, for all we know, a perfectly reasonable

10

assumption would be if our tax pretreatment for water

11

carriers actually increase the amount of water commerce

12

coming into Alabama, that would also increase the amount

13

of commerce that railroads are

14

get to somewhere else in Alabama.

15

moving from docks to

So in light of the fact that there was

16

essentially no evidence at all about water carriers to

17

show that railroads actually suffered some practical

18

disadvantage, I think the district court's reasoning ­­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, there is a

20

practical disadvantage; they paid a tax that the water

21

carriers haven't ­­

1 percent of the market for moving goods from one part

of the ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but under your

5

argument then, you could give tax exemptions to many

6

businesses and then those businesses would grow and give

7

more goods to the railroads.

8

that can't work.

9

MR. BRASHER:

So that's just simply ­­

Well, I think ­­ I think ­­ my

10

point being is that if the only evidence is what the

11

railroads put into the record here, the district court

12

doesn't have to assume that they're going to be

13

practically disadvantaged.

14

would mean that if the State offered a tax exemption or

15

tax incentive to a single competitor of a railroad, to a

16

single company that just operates in a single city of

17

the State, that CSX and every other railroad operating

18

in the State would get exactly the same preference.

19

we could be offering that preference to a single company

20

that costs the State $10,000, but to offer the same

21

preference to the railroads would cost $40 million.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

CSX's position in this case

And

Well, why doesn't Alabama

23

tax the fuel purchased by the water ­­ water carriers?

24

It's kind of curious.

Is it ­­ is it just a remnant of

power?
MR. BRASHER:

Yes.

I ­­ I think it's for

3

historical reasons with respect to the taxation of

4

interstate commerce by water.

5

here actually taxes Alabama's own citizens when

6

they're ­­ when they're moving goods by water commerce

The provision at issue

So we're

We're only not

other State.
And that's another reason why I think the

12

water carriers are largely irrelevant, because the

13

railroads here aren't even asking for the same tax

14

treatment that we give to water carriers in that ­­ in

15

the sense that they don't want to pay taxes at all.

16

They don't want some kind of different treatment based

17

on whether they're moving goods from one part of the

18

State to the other.

19
20
21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You ­­ you tax the

water carriers when they move within Alabama?
MR. BRASHER:

We tax intrastate shipments.

22

So the exemption at issue here is only for the movement

23

of goods in interstate commerce.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is that ­­ how

is that consistent with the statute admitting Alabama to

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so that's the reason why we have this

19

So here, compare

Now, you'll say, as you do say, that we have

a very good reason for treating them differently.

21

trucks have to pay this extra tax for the fuel, and

22

railroads don't.

23

to know, that they'll come back and say, but the reason

24

that they pay that extra tax is to support highways, and

25

railroads don't use highways.

The

My guess is, and this is what I want

And then you'll have to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22

figure out whether that is discrimination or isn't

2

discrimination, because indeed they do pay a higher tax.

3

But it is to go to highways, and does that count or not?

4

Now, my question, I don't think you can

5

answer that ­­ if you want to, try.

7

argument or not?

8

MR. BRASHER:

I'm really just

Well, I think the district

court already addressed that.

So you have a district

10

court opinion in this case which found in our favor

11

applying the competitive comparison class, and like I

12

said, put the comparison class to one side doing

13

effectively what the court told it to do in CSX 1.

14

the district court already addressed that and decided

15

that when the State is ­­ is using tax revenue for

16

general public purposes, it really is irrelevant how the

17

State is raising that revenue.

18

appropriation for highway maintenance and it would be

19

the same thing as having a dedicated source of funding

20

for highway maintenance.

21

truckers are paying for all of Alabama's highway

22

maintenance.

23

State to add money to that to build highways.

24

ultimately, I think the district court was right that

25

that's just a red herring ­­

So

We could have a yearly

And it's not as if the

We're also taxing other people in the

Alderson Reporting Company

And so

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the trucker tax is not

directed to highways exclusively?

4

MR. BRASHER:

It goes into a

No, the ­­ the fuel tax that

5

the truckers are paying is set aside for highway

6

construction, highway maintenance.

7

it's ­­ it's not as if the truckers are the only ones

8

paying for the highways to be built in Alabama; it's not

9

as if the truckers are the only ones using the highways.

But my point is that

10

We'd have to find some funds to build highways

11

regardless of how we get them.

12

And also, CSX's own expert, when testifying

13

in this case, agreed that railroads also benefit from

14

roads, railroads also benefit from schools, and these

15

are the kind of indirect benefits that the State has to

16

provide as part of a general public purposes of the

17

State.

18

But I think the real problem with CSX's

19

proposed rule in this case is that it provides zero ex

20

ante guidance to State policymakers about how to

21

structure a tax system in a way that doesn't

22

discriminate against railroads, but does actually

23

require them to pay their fair share.

24

that's what the Court should focus on.

25

And I think

And the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in this

Alderson Reporting Company

24

case in Footnote 5 of the opinion, the Eleventh Circuit

2

recognized that even if we were requiring truckers to

pay four times as much as we were requiring the

that we are discriminating against railroads in that

circumstance.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

Ms. Goldenberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
We disagree with Petitioners as to the

17

comparison class issue and agree with Petitioners as to

18

the issue of the alternative and comparable tax on the

19

motor carriers.

20

class issue if I could, although I'd like to devote time

21

to both of those issues.

22

I'd like to start with the comparison

With respect to the comparison class issue,

23

I do think, as Justice Scalia's question indicated, that

24

the omission of a specific comparison class in (b)(4) is

25

extremely telling here when there is such a specific

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

comparison class set forth in (b)(1) through (3).

2

also think it's very important that I think there is a

3

very good rational reason why Congress would have wanted

4

to leave the comparison class issue open with respect to

5

(b)(4) and not limit the comparison class in that arena

6

to other commercial and industrial entities.

7

reason is this:

8

Congress can rest assured that virtually all commercial

9

and industrial entities are going to have real property

And I

And the

With respect to property taxes, I think

10

and that if you're grouping the railroads with those

11

entities and you're doing something unduly burdensome,

12

those entities are going to speak up, they're going to

13

use their political power, they're going to complain in

14

some way.

15

have that kind of comparison class.

16

And so it's protective of the railroads to

With respect to other kinds of taxation,

17

non­property taxation, I don't think you can say that

18

the same thing is true.

19

to diesel fuel, I think, and I'm just hypothesizing

20

here, but it is very likely that there are many

21

commercial and industrial taxpayers who either don't use

22

diesel fuel at all or use very little diesel fuel in

23

their businesses, such that a tax on diesel fuel that

24

applies to them is a very small burden for them.

25

you are going to count on the fact that they're going to

And specifically with respect

Alderson Reporting Company

And if

Official

26
1

speak up if there is a very burdensome diesel fuel tax

2

that's laid on them and on railroads, I don't think that

3

that holds true.

4

it's really railroads and their competitors who are

5

using the diesel fuel, then the competitors are the

6

comparison class that you ought to be looking to.

7

And that's a situation in which, if

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Goldenberg, could I ask,

8

you know, in one set of cases maybe a railroad is saying

9

we're being singled out.

In another set of cases a

10

railroad comes in and says no, we're not being singled

11

out but our competitors are being treated better than we

12

are.

13

it mostly just, you know, as compared to the general

14

taxpayer and as compared to competitors?

15

other way to ­­ to shape a complaint in this field?

16

Are there any other kinds of cases out there or is

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Is there any

As far as I'm aware, there

17

is not.

18

other category besides those.

19

that railroads don't make claims that people who aren't

20

their competitors ­­ a small group of people who aren't

21

their competitors are being treated differently than

22

they are.

23

very easy for the State to come in and say, here is a

24

reasonable distinction between those other people and

25

you, the railroad.

And I'm not aware of cases that fall into any
And I think the reason is

Because I think in situations like that it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

So, for instance, you had a church or a

2

school that was being exempted from a tax that a

3

railroad paid, it would be extremely easy for the State

4

to say, well, churches and schools have socially

5

beneficial or charitable purposes, they're not involved

6

in business like railroads, railroads don't compete with

7

them and so it doesn't harm railroad's financial

8

stability to have them exempted.

9

So in some ways the comparison class of

10

competitors is sort of a proxy for the kinds of reasons

11

that the State is going to be able to give in order to

12

distinguish between the allegedly favored and less

13

favored groups.

14

I'd also like to point out that I think

15

there are very serious problems with the singled out or

16

targeted requirement that the State is espousing here.

17

And that is that either ­­ depending on how you apply

18

it, it's going to be highly manipulatable by the State

19

or it's going to have major administrability problems,

20

and let me explain why.

21

If you have a true singled­out requirement,

22

so you find that railroads can't win a discrimination

23

claim under (b)(4) unless they are the only ones who are

24

subject to a tax, then I think it's extremely easy for

25

the State to evade any (b)(4) liability whatsoever

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

simply by grouping together with the railroads some

2

other entity or set of entities on whom the tax burden

3

doesn't fall very heavily or a set of entities that's

4

not very

5

virtually every case the State will be able to escape

6

from (b)(4) liability and sort of vitiate that

7

provision.

8

politically powerful and won't speak up, and in

If you don't have a true singled­out

9

requirement, if you have a more kind of amorphous

10

targeting requirement, then I think you have very

11

problematic line­drawing issues.

12

whether, if you've got five other entities grouped with

13

the railroad or ten other entities or 20 other entities,

14

whether that can ­­ constitutes targeting and where you

15

actually draw the line.

16

Because it's unclear

And so I think that just applying the

17

definition of discriminates that this Court laid out in

18

its decision last time this case was here is actually

19

much easier to apply, much easier to administer than any

20

kind of targeted or singled­out requirement.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could I ask you about the

22

second point?

23

that this is really a very, very difficult comparison to

17

second, make a larger point which is, I think what the

lower court has done here and what courts of appeals

hands and say under no possible circumstances could we

purpose for which the tax revenue is being used, I don't

With respect to the first one, the

Alderson Reporting Company

31

think that that plays into the analysis under (b)(4)

2

about whether there is a discrimination in imposing the

tax.

4

discrimination in how the State uses its tax revenues,

5

but that's not what the statute is about.

6

is about the tax burden that's imposed ­­

because the trucks pay even more for their diesel fuel.

burden because of the language of (b)(4) and also

2

because otherwise you would end up in a very bizarre

3

situation where you could have a unitary tax that fell

4

on motor carriers and railroads equally.

5

tax provision that says motor carriers and railroads,

6

you both pay "X" cents per gallon on your fuel and a

7

railroad could nevertheless come in and claim

8

discrimination under (b)(4) if the State took that tax

revenue and used it to build roads.

10

There's one

That seems like an

awfully strange result.
It would also mean that you could have the

12

same tax structure in different states that would be

13

discriminatory in one state and not discriminatory in

I also agree with what my friend from

here about how the ­­ the motor carriers aren't being in

19

20

general public and it also benefits railroads.

21

Railroads use trucks to bring freight to and from their

22

trains and they are part of the system of the state

where everybody needs these roads.

24

motor carriers benefit a little bit more than other

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

The truth is Alabama ­­ in Alabama, we pay

the protections under the 4­R Act which is designed,

the ­­ and the water carriers.

2

And that's precisely what the comparison

3

class takes you to, which is, it's all well and good to

4

say that, you know, the statute addresses targeting.

5

And that's fine, and that's clearly right because that's

6

what Congress undeniably saw primarily in the count of

7

(b)(1) to (b)(3) range, and that's why it identified

8

this specific class that it was worried about for

9

targeting.

10

But when it gets to the point of talking

about every other form of discrimination, another tax

12

that discriminates, in that context it only makes sense

13

because Congress's other purpose in this was to ensure

15

that there would be financial stability, that the

railroads would, once again, be able to operate on their

own.

18

And, obviously, to the extent that you've

19

authorized the states to choose, for whatever reason, to

20

benefit motor and water carriers routinely to the

21

detriment of the railroads, that completely undermines

it.

14

That's facial discrimination.

It

And if the state had wanted to come in and

15

say, oh, sure we can justify it because they're not

that this is a major competitor of ours and on ­­ on a

Their stipulation is

So I think, Your Honor, the easiest way not

to have to see me again ­­ at least representing CSX in

this context ­­ is to say water carriers count, it's

their stipulation, we shouldn't have had to get to this

issue in any event because I don't think it was in the

simpleminded way, how much are you paying today and how

much are they paying today, and if it's close enough,

that's good enough for government work.

10

The problem with that is, is that all of the

case law that deals with comparability ­­ and this

That seems, to me, a problem for

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, in the first place,

11

it's not a problem for me if you decide on the water

12

carriers.

13

this Court has previously recognized in Snead, in a

14

similar anti­discrimination provision, that it is simply

15

not appropriate to do the kind of simple analysis

16

Alabama proposes here and just say, at the end of the

17

day, electricity is going to be better off in­state than

18

out­of­state or out­of­state than in­state so don't

19

worry about it, we're good.

20

But even on its own terms, it seems to me

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, doesn't it have to be

21

appropriate as going in that Alabama can say, here's the

22

tax that we impose on truckers?

23

treated in the exact same way just under two different

24

provisions of the tax code, and then it's up to you to

25

say why that's wrong.

MR. PHILLIPS:

The court of appeals did not

Right.

And ­­ and I

10

realize ­­ I recognize a bit of a disconnect there.

11

the reason why they said they weren't going to get

12

engaged in that inquiry is because the very items I've

13

identified, the nature of the tax, the purpose of the

14

tax, the incidence of the tax, are very ­­ are all

15

complicated issues and you can go through the rest of

16

the Hellerstein criteria ­­ very complicated issues, and

17

if the State is only going to come in here and try to

18

defend itself on the basis that at one point in time the

19

money is pretty close, that's not going to get it done.

But

20

And so then the question is ­­ and this is

21

where I think the Eleventh Circuit said, look, this is

22

clearly not enough ­­ we're not going to go down this

path and so that's the ruling.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. BRASHER

13

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

14

MR. BRASHER:

15

Let me just make a few quick points.

16

that if you adopt the position that the State's

17

justifications matter, it's no more difficult to analyze

18

a justification that has to do with another tax of any

19

other justification.

20

easier because you can just use math as opposed to

21

evaluating some other justification.

22

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice:
One is

As a matter of fact, it's a lot

And the justification with respect to the

23

truckers is that we are obligated under a series of

24

interstate agreements, international agreements and

25

Federal law, to impose a per­gallon tax on the truckers.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

And then once you impose that tax on the truckers, the

2

question arises should you also impose an additional

3

sales tax on the same transaction as the purchase of

4

diesel fuel.

5

to say, as a policy matter, that we're not going to

6

double tax the same transaction.

7

And it makes perfect sense for the State

It was surprising to hear my friend talk

8

about how he would be fine if the State tried to treat

9

railroads in a way that was the same as truckers,

10

because that's exactly what the State of Tennessee did

11

and it found itself in a real quandary that this Court

12

needs to prevent.

13

that Tennessee was discriminating against them because

14

the railroads weren't treated like truckers.

15

that litigation.

16

and tried to craft a statute that treated railroads

17

exactly the same way as truckers.

18

sued again saying that they were being targeted or

19

singled out for a tax that no one else had to pay.

20

Which is the railroads were arguing

They won

And then ­­ so Tennessee turned around

And then the railroad

And I think that is a necessary implication

21

of the rule that my friend on the other side is adopting

22

which is that it is ­­ it is discrimination to treat

23

railroads unlike anyone that they particularly say that

24

they compete with and it's also discrimination to try to

25

avoid that discrimination.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57

And the other point I would make is that

2

we're not talking in this case about a tax on diesel

3

fuel.

4

us a check for their taxes, there is one line and it

5

says sales tax.

6

basis on sales tax.

7

businesses in the State that have to pay the sales tax

8

on the items that they need for their businesses, are

9

sending us the same check that says this is what we have

10
11

We're talking about a sales tax.

When CSX sends

This is how much we pay to the State
And everybody else, all the other

to pay on sales tax.
And with respect to diesel specifically,

12

manufacturing companies, timber companies, construction

13

companies, when they send us a check, they ­­ they say

14

sales tax and that includes everything else that they

15

have to pay on the sales tax and the diesel fuel.

16

that money that we're using, that we're collecting by

17

the sales tax, goes to ­­ primarily for education, which

18

is something that the railroads benefit from just like

19

everyone else in the State.

And

20

But ultimately what we're asking the Court

21

to do is adopt a rule that if we are using the ­­ the

22

hand­picked class of competitors, that the courts

23

actually have to weigh a State's reasons for the

24

exemptions in its tax code and with a focus on whether

25

the railroads are suffering any practical disadvantage.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

And that's what the Eleventh Circuit refused to do.

2

That's ultimately what the district court did do.

3

And I think I disagree with my friend on the

4

other side about the burden of proof in this case.

5

always going to be the railroad's burden of proof to

6

show discrimination.

7

applied exactly the right formula for determining that.

8

Which is ­­ which is if you're in the zone where you're

9

using the railroads' competitors as a comparison class,

It's

And I think the district court

10

then you're in that area because you're worried about

11

whether they're suffering some practical disadvantage

12

vis­à­vis their competitors.

13

to strike down a tax if they actually are suffering some

14

real world practical disadvantage and that's something

15

that they never showed in this case.

And so it makes sense only

16

Ultimately, what the Court should do is it

17

should put itself in the position of a state and local

18

policy maker who is trying to impose a fair and

19

non­discriminatory tax scheme that does not discriminate

20

against railroads but does actually require them to pay

21

their fair share of taxes.

22

I think we proposed two rules in this case

23

that would allow that State policy maker, when he or she

24

is being lobbied by all sorts of other industry groups

25

to get tax exemptions, to figure out whether they can

2

taxes that a completely separate industry group would

5

focus on whether railroads are being singled out or you

6

can say the courts must actually weigh a State's reasons

7

for the exemptions in its tax code with a focus on

8

whether railroads are being practically disadvantaged.

And that is that you can use a

Well, I would make one point

14

about that and that the only thing in the record is not

15

only that they're 1 percent of the market, but that

16

specific stipulation that we entered into is about the

17

intrastate market, 1 percent of the intrastate market.

18

23
