CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW E. MEYER

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. MEYER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

In cases of foul acts done in secret where

11

the child is the party injured, the repelling of their

12

evidence entirely is in some measure denying them the

13

protection of the law.

14

That 254­year­old passage, I think, quite

15

accurately predicts the situation we find ourselves in

16

in Ohio following the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court

17

in this case, we believe, misapplying the Sixth

18

Amendment Confrontation Clause to these facts.

19

We believe the Ohio Supreme Court erred in

20

two fundamental ways.

21

parties who are acting with no police involvement by

22

virtue of their mandatory reporter's status are

23

transformed into law enforcement agents or agents of the

24

government for purposes of the Confrontation Clause

25

analysis.

First, when it held that private

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have to be an agent

2

of the government for the Confrontation Clause to kick

3

in?

4

MR. MEYER:

Based on this Court's

5

post­Crawford decisions, we believe that that is the

6

primary analysis that should be conducted.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not primary.

I'm asking,

8

is it ­­ is it exclusive that no person who's not an

9

agent of the government can trigger a Confrontation

10

Clause protection?

11

mean, you ­­ you can have a cross­examination in a civil

12

case, a lawyer in a civil case has somebody on the

13

stand.

14

I mean, that's clearly not true.

MR. MEYER:

22

attaches to the oath that a witness is taking and an

23

understanding ­­

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a question of

solemnity, but solemnity ­­ solemnity has nothing to do

with whether you're a civilian or ­­ or a policeman.
MR. MEYER:

Well, going ­­ going back to

3

Crawford itself and what this Court explained was the

4

purpose behind the Sixth Amendment, when the framers

5

adopted it, was to prevent a very specific kind of

6

abuse.

7

investigating crimes for purposes of a criminal

8

prosecution.

Isn't the test whether

the statement is intended to be testimonial in nature?

MR. MEYER:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor, that ­­
So whether it's given to

17

a private individual or a police officer is irrelevant.

18

The question is, was it intended to substitute for

19

testimony to be used later.

20

MR. MEYER:

That is the test that this Court

21

has announced in ­­ in Davis certainly.

22

submitted, I think, perhaps a threshold formulation

23

maybe, before you get to primary purpose, and this Court

24

has consistently applied it to law enforcement actors.

25

When you talk about private persons, I think that is an

5
Alderson Reporting Company

But we have

Official

1

easier test, coming from this as a boots­on­the­ground

2

trial prosecutor and trying to predict the way that

3

primary purpose test is going to be applied, I would

4

suggest the private party analysis as a first step would

5

lead to more predictable results.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Certainly ­­

Mr. Meyer, could you

7

explain one anomaly in this case?

8

a half years old, is incompetent to appear in court as a

9

witness.

The child, three and

How can the substitute be permissible?

If the

10

child is incompetent to testify in court, why isn't the

11

child incompetent to testify out ­­ make the same

12

statement out of court?

13

MR. MEYER:

Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,

14

I think it would be a mistake to say that his

15

incapability, his incompetence for purposes of the

16

courtroom setting means that nothing he's ever said on

17

planet Earth could be taken as a reliable statement.

18

Any parent knows that talking to their three year old,

19

certain things they say can be relied upon.

20

The Ohio rule, evidence rule 807, which is

21

modeled, I think, off of this Court's opinion in Idaho

22

v. Wright somewhat applies very rigorous factors to

23

determine reliability.

24
25

And so I think the ­­ the choice for a
prosecutor is not between live testimony and hearsay.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

think when you deal with a three year old, it's a choice

2

between hearsay and nothing.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

the hearsay rule.

6

but how could this child ever have the intent that

7

whether particular evidence is testimonial or not.

MR. MEYER:

I don't think he can.

And I

think, looking at this Court's emphasis in ­­ in both

13

Davis and Bryant on the declarant's purpose, if you view

14

it from that standpoint, and Crawford ­­ Crawford's

15

requirement that the person bear testimony, he's just

16

incapable of doing so.

5

other hearsay principles that are so well settled that

6

it's a violation of either the Confrontation Clause or

7

the Due Process Clause?

8

MR. MEYER:

Or is it before us

And if you have a situation where the States are

designing their rules for the deliberate purpose of ­­

of avoiding having live witnesses come to court, a sham

20

rule, that would be a very arbitrary rule under the Due

If you disagree with my

formulation that private parties is the first step, this

Court has consistently said that there's three key

inquiries.

13

been this Court's focus, but also the intent of the

14

questioner, and the circumstances of the questioning.

15

And at the outer margins, I suppose there could be a

16

situation where the intent of the ­­ the questioner

17

might tip the balance.

18

Supreme Court seemed to put all of its emphasis on the

19

possible speculative intent of the questioner, and I

20

think that's fundamentally wrong.

21

declarant isn't to do anything other than respond to the

22

basic questions asked like the declarant in Bryant, like

23

the declarant in Davis, I don't think you have

The intent of the declarant, I think, has

So ­­
I think the ­­ the intent from

8

the questioner's standpoint, the teacher was just simply

that.

And I think a helpful way to look at this,

10

Justice Sotomayor, is to remove this reporting

11

requirement and ask if the questions would be any

12

different.

13

And I submit they would not.

These are just the basic questions that a

14

teacher would ask when a three year old comes to school

15

with a bruised face.

16

their student and to say that that teacher is

17

stepping into a role of a law enforcement officer, I

18

think, is ­­

19

It's a concern the teacher has for

reliability, and that goes to whatever the finder of

fact, whether they take that approach or they take

22

another.

making in deciding the intent of the declarant, you have

24

to look at what everyone else is doing and who they are.

But the point, I think, that Justice Kagan is

Well, I think that ­­ it ­­ it

11
Alderson Reporting Company

may go to reliability, but more fundamentally, it goes

2

to the function that these actors are ­­ are performing.

3

And if these aren't law enforcement people, if there's

4

no direction by the police, this is just a teacher and

5

student.

Let's just presume a 13­year­old kid rather
And the 13­year­old kid comes in

10

with welts or bruises or whatever it is, and the teacher

11

says to the 13­year­old, Listen, Joe, I want to know

12

what happened, but I want to tell you that I'm under a

13

statutory reporting obligation, so everything you tell

14

me, I'm going to tell the police, and I'm going to write

15

down everything you tell me just so I can get the facts

16

straight.

17

Would you think that that is testimonial

18

such that it's a violation of the Confrontation Clause

19

if that comes into a case without the opportunity for

20

cross­exam?

21
22
23

MR. MEYER:

It ­­ it may be, and if I could

explain.
If both the intent of the questioner and the

24

intent of the declarant both acknowledge that, in some

25

way, this is going to the police and the circumstances

of the discussion is for the police, that's a much

2

closer question, and I would ­­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that seems to me then,

is then ­­ it suggests that the way to do this is

5

actually more the way the S.G. suggests, that we should

6

just ask in every case whether there ­­ whether a

7

statement is testimonial rather than to draw the very

8

sharp distinctions you want us to with respect to

9

private parties.

10

MR. MEYER:

Well, I think the Solicitor

11

General in Ohio's opinion are ­­ are harmonious in that

12

they agree in their brief that in almost every

13

circumstance, a private discussion is not going to be

14

testimonial because it's just not for law enforcement.

15

And maybe the better way, if the Court agrees, is to

16

view it as a threshold determination before you even get

17

to the question of purpose.

outer margins of some of these hypotheticals, you have

19

to look at purpose to sort out difficult facts.

And I would agree at the

To say that, like the Ohio Supreme Court

21

did, we just look at the foreseeability of the statement

SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MS. EISENSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

The Ohio Supreme Court did err by viewing

8

the teachers here as equivalent to police.

9

could turn first to Justice Sotomayor's concern there, I

And if I

10

think that it is significant that these were teachers

11

and not police officers; teachers who were not acting as

12

surrogates for police, but in their normal, ordinary

13

role as care providers for this child.

14

Teachers aren't in the business of

15

prosecution.

16

evidence, and as such, this Court can generally presume

17

that when they inquire of their students as to how they

18

got hurt, they are asking out of a concern for welfare,

19

safety, and out of their normal, routine role, not as a

20

means of collecting evidence.

21

They're not in the business of collecting

It's also significant that when you take

22

away, you strip away that view of the teachers as

23

equivalent to police, the conversation viewed through

24

that lens takes on a very different character.

25

of scrutinizing each question and answer to determine

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Instead

Official

1

whether this is an emergency on the one hand, or whether

2

it is a ­­ a need to address a criminal violation,

3

instead there is a whole range of reasons why these

4

teachers, out of care for the student, would be asking

5

what happened and how the child got hurt.

6

And fundamentally, the type of fluid,

7

informal, spontaneous conversation between the teachers

8

and the students is far from resembling the type of core

9

Confrontation Clause testimonial statements.

It lacks

10

the type of formality, the solemnity, and it also

11

reflects that the teachers were addressing a present

12

purpose in trying to understand how this child was

13

injured.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what happens,

15

Ms. Eisenstein, really along the lines of the

16

hypothetical that I gave to Mr. Meyer where it's pretty

17

clear to both the teacher and the student that back of

18

that conversation, is the presence of police.

19

words, the teacher will say, I'm under a reporting

20

obligation, or maybe the kid will bring it up.

tell you, does that mean it's going to the police?

recognizing that this teacher is essentially a direct

conduit to police in a way that a 3­year­old child here

5

certainly did not.

for police.

concerns with prosecution and police questioning is that

may, for one thing, shade the nature of the

13

conversation.

14

level of structure and formality, that simply the

15

conversation would tend to resemble testimony or the

16

taking of evidence.

17

It's also a concern where there is a

thing is the child is asked immediately, on the spot,

is they don't remember.

15

MR. FISHER:

Part of your answer I don't follow because one

The trial is

Well, that ­­ that ­­ that is

an issue.

jurisprudence squarely holds that even if a witness has

Of course, the Court's Confrontation Clause

21

But I think you're also asking, you know,

22

what good would cross­examination do in this setting,

23

and so let me answer that in two ways.

24

there are innumerable reasons ­­ and perhaps, Justice

Kennedy, when you've talked about reliability, some of

these were in your mind ­­ as to why we might doubt the

a line, is it Dee?

5

LP, knew that his three older siblings had already been

removed from his mother's custody because she had abused

them, so he would have had an incentive and knowledge of

how the system worked when he was answering that

question.

15

clinical setting that you suggested in your brief.

16

And I'm the trial judge, and this statement

Any problems with that?

What ­­ what if ­­

17

if we're saying what the rule should be in that kind of

18

situation, that kind of State, what ­­ what guidance can

you offer?

20

MR. FISHER:

I ­­ I think you would start

21

with Maryland against Craig where the Court has held

22

that confrontation of children can be more flexible to

23

accommodate child's perceptions, understandings and

24

abilities.

11

gets me back to Justice Kennedy's question, I believe,

12

which is, we think it would be perfectly acceptable to

13

have testimony, if necessary, and if proper findings

14

were made taken outside of a courtroom, perhaps even

15

through an expert, I think a very strong argument could

16

be made, if it were necessary to be made to this Court

17

or any other, that if by interviewing the child outside

18

of a courtroom in a more therapeutic setting is more

19

likely to be able to enable the child to tell his story

20

and to answer questions, then that's what confrontation

21

is all about.

22
23
24
25

We think that's a much better rule and it

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And if ­­ but if that

happened, would the statement to the teacher come in?
MR. FISHER:

Yes, of course, because once

you have confrontation, then you can bring in any prior

statement, and that's the essence of our position.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But by confrontation you

3

mean the ­­ you ­­ you have a therapeutic expert, but as

4

the defendant's witnesses, you're not ­­ I don't think

5

you suggested that the Court could appoint its own

6

expert and the defendant would be out of it.

7

this is ­­ the way we do things in our adversary system

8

is you're a partisan expert, you're the defense expert.

9

MR. FISHER:

I mean,

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think

10

the defense would have to have some inclusion in this

11

questioning.

12

a child interview specialist conducts the interview, but

13

she has an earpiece with the defendant's lawyer in

14

another room that's able to direct questions for.

So you put all this together and

39

that the criminal process is hanging over this.

2

really, the only hard problem is I think the one Justice

Ginsburg is asking is, how do you disentangle that or

4

how do you weigh that against the protective purpose,

5

which the teacher must have had as well.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so

Mr. ­­ Mr. Fisher, can I ask

7

a question that steps back a little bit?

8

seems to me that the strongest part of your case goes

9

something like this.

Because it

This is a statement that's going

scary.

20

you're not being able to do the things that you normally

21

do.

22

And then you're not being able to question it,

Okay.

So all of that, seems to me, that's

23

your strongest case.

24

fit very well with the test we have and what the

25

questions that we're supposed to ask.

And it seems to me that it doesn't

Alderson Reporting Company

all of what I said seems to be ­­ or most of what I said

3

question that we ask under the primary purpose test and

4

what do we do with that lack of fit?

5

MR. FISHER:

I think I can answer that

6

question while also going back to the question I posed

7

before you asked the question, which is what do you do

8

when it's too difficult to pinpoint a purpose?

9

of the power of the ­­

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think the linkage

between the two is that when a statement is made outside

the courtroom for the primary purpose of establishing

4

facts that might be relevant to a later criminal

5

prosecution, then when it's transported into the

6

courtroom, it does perform the substitute of trial

7

testimony, which is exactly why you so accurately said,

there was such power in this statement.

So the

I think a jury would view

23

a stray remark to an acquaintance, as the Court has put

2

by a child who is under 12 years of age at the time of

4

words "at the time of trial" are in this hearsay rule?

If it were designed to pluck out reliable statements

6

from the world, it ought to be asking some question

7

about the world when the statement was made.

9

trial, which is still further evidence that what Ohio is

But it's

10

doing is gathering up these statements to use them as a
