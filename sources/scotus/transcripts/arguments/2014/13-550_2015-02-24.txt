CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This Court granted certiorari to decide

11

whether ERISA's statute of limitations bars claims for

12

breaches of fiduciary duty regarding investment options

13

that were added to a plan more than six years before the

14

suit was filed.

15

bar such claims for three reasons.

The answer is no.

The statute does not

16

First, ERISA's fiduciary duties include

17

monitoring existing investment options and removing

18

imprudent ones.

19

remove an imprudent investment option starts a new

20

statute of limitations.

21

Second, each failure to review and

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

One of the things that I

22

was looking for, Mr. Frederick, in the record is some

23

evidence as to what exactly that monitoring entails.

24

I ­­ I took your brother's responsive brief as saying it

25

can't be a complete due diligence that you do when you

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

buy something, otherwise, the funds would grind to a

2

halt.

3

So where in the record is there some proof

4

of what the monitoring ­­ or what the level of

5

monitoring should have been and what the breach was

6

here?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Sotomayor, we were

8

precluded at summary judgment from making the argument

9

that the continued imprudence of maintaining these

10

investment options was a breach of fiduciary duty.

11

district court's summary judgment order ­­ and I would

12

direct the Court to Petition Appendix 262 to 263 ­­

13

barred us from bringing imprudence claims as to the

14

funds added in 1999.

15

Appendix, the district court explained that applying a

16

circuit precedent known as Phillips, the plaintiffs had

17

to prove that there was a change in circumstances

18

significant enough to make the continued investment in

19

that investment option an imprudent one.

20

The

At page 180 in the Petition

So the theory that we were precluded by the

21

summary judgment order from advancing was the theory

22

that keeping this investment option available during

23

this time period was imprudent.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But if ­­ if we agree that

there had to be some significant event or change that

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would trigger the ­­ the need to reexamine this

2

investment, then we would affirm.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.
Okay.
What ­­ what happened at

6

trial was that after the summary judgment order, the

7

judge barely opened the door to say if, plaintiffs, you

8

can show that there was a significant enough change,

9

I'll allow you to prove that there was ­­ that it was

10

equivalent to the new selection of an investment option,

11

and ­­ and we lost on that issue as a factual matter.

12

That was affirmed on appeal.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And ­­
What's your position?

14

That ­­ that every ­­ every stock that is owned has to

15

be reviewed every year as though it was a new purchase?

16

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

Our position is that

17

the periodic duty to monitor requires at least some

18

familiarity with the filings of that particular fund and

19

an awareness of what the expenses and performance of it

20

are.

21

readily available on the Internet; it is readily

22

available with a phone call or two.

SEC filings.

24

manager would look at thousands of mutual funds in the

25

industry, all that we're saying here is that the trustee

This expense ratio information, Justice Scalia, is

It is part of the

And unlike an initial review where a fund

5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

should have looked at what was publicly available

2

information about the very mutual funds that were part

3

of this particular plan.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You also said, did you

5

not, that ­­ that there was this committee that met

6

periodically to review investments?

7

they met quarterly.

8

MR. FREDERICK:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

I think you said

Correct.
And that there had been,

as a result of those quarterly reviews, changes ­­

11

MR. FREDERICK:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.
­­ in investments.
That's correct.

And, in

14

fact, the district court found that as to a fund that

15

was being reviewed in 2003, they discovered that there

16

were institutional shares available and they immediately

17

switched to the lower cost institutional shares.

18

the district court further found that as to the other

19

funds that were added in 2002, the trustees had never

20

made an inquiry about the availability of lower cost

21

institutional funds.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But

That was one of the

23

questions I had in my own mind.

24

below that once they found out about the

25

institutional ­­ the institutional funds, that that was

Did you ever argue

a changed circumstance?
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, it was only as to the

3

one fund that had been changed, but the court recall in

4

its summary judgment order on page 262 had said, you're

5

barred from bringing claims of imprudence as to the

6

funds added in 1999.

7
8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Unless there were

changed circumstances.
MR. FREDERICK:

Unless there were

10

significant changes, so significant ­­ and this was the

11

holding of the prior Ninth Circuit and the Fourth

12

Circuit and Eleventh Circuit precedents that would be

13

tantamount to adding a new fund.

14

there are existing institutional share funds for mutual

15

funds out there was not deemed by the district court to

16

meet that standard.

17

So just simply because

And in their post­trial brief, and this is

18

at the docket at page 3 ­­ docket number 381 at page 13,

19

which we quote in our reply brief, "Edison said we had

20

gone beyond what the district court summary judgment

21

order was and, therefore, we were precluded from making

22

arguments about the imprudence of the 1999 funds."

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we forget what happened

24

at earlier stages of this litigation, and I think that

25

the parties' positions have clarified, when you put it

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

that way, as this has progressed, what ­­ on what point

2

of law do you and Mr. Hacker now disagree?

3

you disagree.

4

the answer to the question presented is.

5

no.

6

7

I'm not sure

You certainly do not disagree about what

MR. FREDERICK:

You both say

I think that the point of

8

law that we disagree ­­ and I would urge you,

9

Justice Alito, to ask that question to Mr. Hacker,

10

because their brief is somewhat schizophrenic.

11

beginning, they say no, and at the end, they say yes.

12

They ask you to affirm the Ninth Circuit on the merits,

13

and the Ninth Circuit held that there was a significant

14

change in circumstances.

At the

Now, but forget ­­

And that is the point,

Justice Alito, where I think we disagree.

believe that ERISA's statutory standard, which is at

19

1104(a)(1)(b), and it says that the standard by statute

20

is what a reasonable investor would do under the

21

circumstances then prevailing, would require the

22

introduction of an added burden to overcome, which is

23

that there had been significant changed circumstances

since the initial investment.

Well, I will ask Mr. Hacker.

But I ­­ you understand him to take the position that

10

unless there are some changed circumstances, a trustee

11

can simply make no inquiry about the continued prudence

12

of assets purchased in the past.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

That's actually ­­

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

You just sit on them.

You

15

don't even think about whether this is still a good

16

investment or not.

17

position.

18

That ­­ that ­­ you think that's his

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Alito, whether

19

that's his position anymore is of no moment to me.

20

That's the position of the Fourth Circuit in the David

21

case, the Eleventh Circuit in the Fuller case, the Ninth

22

Circuit in this case applying the Phillips case.

23

those are the cases that we urged as conflicts that

24

should be resolved in favor of a statutory construction

25

that says the duty to monitor and remove imprudent

9
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1
2

investments is part of ERISA's fiduciary duty.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

And if I could just ask

3

again, Mr. Frederick, what that duty includes in

4

addition to the changed circumstances situation.

5

other words, just on a continuing basis ­­ and tell me

6

in a way that includes this case but isn't limited to

7

this case ­­ on a continuing basis what is a trustee

8

supposed to do under the prudent person's standard?

9

MR. FREDERICK:

Sure.

Three things.

In

One,

10

look at the performance on a regular basis, a periodic

11

basis.

12

there a cheaper way to get the same investment for less

13

money that's coming out of the beneficiaries' assets.

14

Number 3, has there been an ­­ an alteration in the

15

management such that one ought to look further and more

16

deeply into it.

17

Number 2, look at the expenses and determine is

And at the very least, Justice Kagan, one

18

would think you'd look at the SEC filings for that

19

mutual fund to determine whether or not there had been

20

something that would require a ­­ a determination of

21

imprudence.

And that's not heavy lifting.

22

The district court here found that as to

23

the three funds added in 2002, the trustee had never

24

even called the mutual fund to say, hey, we've got

25

$3 billion in assets.

Do you think we could get a

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

better rate for the expenses charged to the

2

beneficiaries?

3

They never even asked the question.

So at the very least, you could write an

4

opinion that says, there's a tribal issue of fact as to

5

whether or not the burden was so great on the fiduciary

6

that it couldn't do the simple thing that the district

7

court already found as a matter of fact had been

8

breached with respect to the 2002 funds.

9

Now, it with respect to one of the 2002 funds,

10

there were two funds that were still being held by the

11

plan at the time of judgment.

12

The other was added in 1999.

13

part of its order ­­ post­trial order, ordered Edison to

14

change the 2002 fund.

15

expense ratio was 24 percent higher than the

be changed so that the institutional share class be

18

available.

19

Capital Appreciation Fund, the district court didn't do

20

that, even though the expense ratio was 37 percent

higher from the retail share to the institutional share.

In other words, there are costs to

6

that was imprudent in the first place, to ­­ to buy,

that it, nonetheless, could be true that a hold decision

8

9

MR. FREDERICK:

It ­­ it's theoretically

10

possible, and in the world of Supreme Court

11

hypotheticals, Justice Kagan, maybe there is a situation

12

in which that would make sense.

13

In the real world of investing, what we're

14

talking about here is economies of scale.

15

difference between the retail share class and the

16

institutional share class is that the institutional

17

shares have more money invested in the exact same

18

assets.

The only

Do you think both parties

hold?

You agree to that.

Thank you, counsel.

SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

ongoing monitoring and failure to switch the funds is

MS. SAHARSKY:

Let ­­ let me be as concrete

11

as possible really, and I think there's really two

12

answers to your question.

13

Okay.

The first is the legal standard

14

that's in ERISA, which is the Court recognized in the

15

Fifth ­­ Fifth Third case is one that depends on what a

16

prudent investor would do under the circumstances then

17

prevailing.

That's the legal test.

18

But then there's a question to the second

19

part about how you would apply that legal test to an

20

on ­­ a claim of imprudent ongoing monitoring.

21

think that depends on the circumstances, but I'd like to

22

give the Court four data points.

23

And I do

The first is that the duty for ongoing

24

monitoring is not the same as what you would do when

25

initially putting the funds in place.

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The second is, is that what typically

2

happens out in the world is that after the funds are put

3

in place, there is ­­ there are benchmarks set; and in

4

this case, there were the investment criteria set,

5

performance, expense ratios, et cetera, that would be

6

revisited at a periodic basis.

meetings in this case to look at those investment

9

criteria, and those include performance and expenses.

I think as

10

The third thing is in terms of how you prove

11

this or how you establish it, there's a ­­ there's not a

12

checklist that can be checked in every case.

13

that this is litigated typically, and what happened in

14

this case, is that an expert is on the stand and says,

15

Here's what I would do as a prudent investor under these

16

circumstances.

The way

17

But then the fourth data point, which I

18

think is actually a very important one, is that the

19

ongoing monitoring duty is not limited to circumstances

20

in which the fund changed so much that it's like a new

21

fund is being put in place.

22

a periodic basis and, really, how are you going to know

23

if there have been changes unless you looked.

24
25

You have a duty to look on

And just to make it clear, the Ninth Circuit
did not say, Well, whether you should make a change or

Ninth Circuit's changed circumstances was fundamental to

period as running only from the initial time a new fund

5

is put in place.

6

had to do with is whether there was something that

7

changed about the fund that made it like a new fund

8

being put in place.

9

The

They looked at the limitations

And so what this changed circumstances

And just one other point.

The argument that

10

was being made below by Respondents, and it's not clear

11

to me to ­­ to ­­ the extent to which they continue to

12

believe it, is that you have six years from when the new

13

fund is put in place, and that's it.

14

that, unless the fund changes so much that it's like a

15

new fund, these funds are basically insulated forever

16

from any scrutiny, which is a problem for the reason

17

that Mr. Frederick pointed out.

18

Other ­­ after

And really one of the reasons the Department

19

of Labor is here today is you're talking about a long

20

time horizon, and to say that people's investments

21

can ­­ the ­­ the value of their funds can really be

22

decreased in that way without any scrutiny is ­­ is

23

unfair.

the Court has.

Well, the question

11

that was ­­ to make sure I get to this, of course.

12

question that was teed up for the Court was, is there ­­

is ­­ is the fact that the funds were put in place

14

outside of the limitations period something that would

15

preclude you from bring ­­ bringing a case about what

related to the initial selection.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

And that's

4

because they have this changed circumstance rule where

5

it has ­­ the change can only be something like a new

6

fund?

7

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes.

They understood that,

8

and they ­­ they described that in the record to be like

9

a new fund.

10
11
12

And I'd just ­­ one other point I would like
to address is with respect ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me, though.

It

13

seems to me that ­­ that you ­­ you're ­­ you're

14

misdescribing them when you say that they said it's only

15

the purchase that can be subject to scrutiny.

16

think they ­­ they did say that the holding can be

17

subject to scrutiny as well so long as there has been

18

some change in circumstance.

19

MS. SAHARSKY:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I ­­ I

The change ­­
Now, you can say that, you

21

know, that refers you back to a ­­ to a new ­­ new

22

purchase standard, but it's still ­­ they ­­ they say

23

that within that period, you can bring a suit.

24
25

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

If it is the

equivalent ­­ the changed circumstances are the

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

equivalent of bringing a new fund.

2

was trying to clarify that is because I think a

3

person ­­ an ordinary person could just be talking and

4

say, well, should I make changes to the fund or not?

5

depends on if circumstances change.

6

the Ninth Circuit wasn't addressing that merits question

7

of whether they had breached the duty of prudence or

8

they hadn't breached the duty of prudence.

9

limiting the claim on statute of limitations grounds

The reason that I

It

But that's not ­­

They were

10

because it either had to be a fund ­­ a new fund being

11

put in place or changed circumstances that made it like

12

a new fund.

13

hopefully am more clear about that.

14

So that's ­­ that's what I meant to say and

I guess if I could just say on the first

15

question presented, the one that we think is before the

16

Court just to make clear because there is disagreement

17

in the circuits about this, that we essentially want the

18

Court to hold three things.

19

The first is that Plaintiffs can bring a

20

claim for imprudent monitoring and retention of funds

21

based on what happened within the limitations period.

22

That's timely under the statute.

23

The second is that the Ninth Circuit was

24

wrong to say that the only way the claim can be timely

25

is either if it's from the time of a new fund or based

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on this changed circumstances that make it like a new

2

fund because there is an ongoing duty of prudence that

3

runs for the fiduciaries under the statute.

4

really why we got into this case at the court of appeals

5

stage and why we're here now is that ERISA has ongoing

6

fiduciary duties, and both the courts below and

7

Respondents were arguing against that and finding

8

against that below.

And that's

9

And then the third thing is that we think

10

that the Court should remand for consideration of the

11

merits of this.

12

about the merits because you just wonder what need ­­

13

would need to be done for the monitoring whatever else.

14

But that's not a claim that was really addressed at all

15

below.

16

of detailed way before this Court or that was briefed

17

below because these claims were really cut off at the

18

outset.

19

general guidance, it is, after all, a statutory

20

standard.

21

And I know that the Court has questions

It wasn't something that we briefed in any kind

So although the Court could provide some

It depends on the facts and circumstances.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if I could just

22

understand that, essentially, you want us to say, look,

23

there is this prudent person standard.

24

throughout to monitor and as well as to the original

25

purchase, but then we're not really going to tell you

24
Alderson Reporting Company

It applies

Official

1

what that prudent person standard is, that we will

2

instead let the lower courts deal with that in ­­ in

3

considering this case.

4

Is that what you want?

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes.

That the courts would

5

need to depend on the facts and circumstances ­­ figure

6

out under the facts and circumstances whether there was

7

a breach of the duty of what ­­ based on what happened

8

within the limitations period.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you want us to say

10

that whatever it is, it isn't solely whether there's

11

been a change in circumstances so extreme as to amount

12

to purchasing a new stock.

13

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes.

That's right.

And

14

that ­­ that's the trust loss sources.

15

know, you have a duty to look from time to time.

16

can't just set the funds and hold them and forget about

17

them.

18

external that's like a new fund being put in place.

19

just ­­ you have a duty to look.

20

how often you look might depend on the circumstances,

21

and how deep you look might depend on the circumstances,

22

but you have a duty to look.

23

We say that, you
You

And the duty to look isn't triggered by something

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And it might depend ­­

But when Mr. Frederick said

24

before, he said something like anything ­­ any periodic

25

review, you're going to look at the returns, you're

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to look at the expenses, and you're going to look

2

to see whether there's a change in the ­­ in the, you

3

know, basic nature of the company or something.

4

agree with all of that; is that right?

5

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yeah.

You

I think that's fairly

6

typical, and it actually was ­­ those were the

7

benchmarks that were set by the investment committee in

8

this case, that they had five investment criteria, and

9

the first of them ­­ the first three of them were you

10

always look at performance, you always look at the

11

expense ratio, and you look at the management of the

12

fund.

13

that you need to look at both performance and expense

14

ratio on a regular basis because the first fiduciary

15

duty that's listed in Section 1104 is to ­­ to act for

16

the exclusive ­­ the exclusive purpose of paying

17

benefits and defraying the reasonable expenses of the

18

fund.

19

And actually, I think that follows from ERISA

ERISA itself tells you to look at expenses.
If the Court has no further questions, we

20

would urge you to reverse and remand for a consideration

21

of the merits.

22
23
24
25

MR. HACKER:

A couple points on that one if

I may, Your Honor.
First of all, the passage that Mr. Frederick
pointed to on page 18 says, "Characterizing the mere

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

continued offering of a plan option" ­­ and I agree with

2

him, the key words are the next two that follow ­­

3

"without more as a subsequent breach would render

4

the" ­­ "the statute meaningless," et cetera, et cetera.

5

The "without more" is clearly referring to establishing

6

a breach of the duty to monitor in that process.

7

If you don't come into court and show that

8

there was a problem or flaw in the monitoring process,

9

you can't win a claim ­­ a challenge to the monitoring

10

process.

11

is responding to the argument they

12

we want to come into court and say we establish that the

13

­­ that the fund was initially selected through an

14

imprudent process, and therefore, the fund was initially

15

imprudent and as long as it stayed in the plan, it was a

16

continuing violation.

the monitoring process.

and it became clearer today, with a couple of points

23

that Mr. Frederick made.

24
25

We disagree, I think,

First of all ­­ and this, I think, was in
response to your question.

Mr. Frederick said that the

about the dismissal of the writ.

4

the duty ­­ duty to monitor looks like on an absent

5

record like this one.

6

say that the ­­ the duty to monitor includes a

7

continuing duty to look for cheaper funds.

8

to a fund like this when there's 40 funds in the lineup,

9

his theory is that on a periodic basis, whether it's

I would be surprised

But Mr. Frederick wants you to

With respect

10

daily, or monthly, or quarterly, or annually, every time

or not there is a cheaper option.

20

with trust administration, generally, the duty to

Not a word of it.
Well, Mr. Hacker, here's

3

what you say ­­ here's what you say in your brief.

4

you say in your brief is, "After the initial selection,

5

the fiduciary may conduct much less intensive periodic

6

reviews monitoring only" ­­ "monitoring only for

7

significant changes in the value and risks of the

8

investments."

9

What

That presents a very different view.

MR. HACKER:

That's ­­ that comes straight

10

out of trust law, because that is what the typical duty

11

to monitor is what you're looking for are significant

12

changes because, as Mr. Frederick says, and I fully

13

agree, how else ­­ I think it was Ms. Saharsky,

14

actually ­­ how else would you know if there had been

15

changes if you're not looking for them?

neither Court below said in any respect ­­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We aren't saying,

As I see the difference, you

20

say you're monitoring only for significant changes in

21

22

saying, look, you have this periodic duty.

There's three things

First of all, there was a

Contrary to everything you just heard,

10

there was a trial on whether or not they could and

11

should ­­ the fiduciaries could and should have switched

12

the share classes.

13

The court went on and on, took over the

14

questioning to ask whether or not that should have

15

happened here; and there was evidence in the record as

16

to why it didn't happen here.

17

evidence.

18

Court last week to show that everybody understood that

19

that was a claim at ­­ at stake.

20

And I can go into that

And it was in the letter I provided to the

And what happened was their expert

21

ultimately said, I don't think, during the regular ­­ he

22

would not endorse the proposition that during the

23

routine, periodic monitoring that everybody agreed our

24

fiduciaries conducted, that they would have caught this

25

kind of problem.

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And as the second point, the reason is,

2

you're not looking in the periodic monitoring to see

3

whether each of the funds in the lineup is the cheapest

4

one available.

5

Now, they say it looks easy here because it

6

was just a different share class in the same fund, but

7

that's actually a different investment.

8

switch, you don't just press a button and switch into

9

the institutional­share class.

In order to

You have to sell the

11

in the retail­share class; make all of the changes with

respect to that kind of change, with respect to each

13

participant who is already invested in the retail­share

14

class.

15

And the evidence at trial, uncontradicted by

16

plaintiffs and their expert, was that that kind of

17

change causes disruptions that employees don't like,

18

which is why the monitoring process generally was

19

limited to looking for changes.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now ­­

Now, really, are you

21

saying ­­ what kind of disruption could be worth, on an

22

ongoing basis, for people who have invested in funds for

23

30 and 40 years and where there's a significant

of what it consists of and nobody so far in the lower

16

courts has really gone into that, probably we should

17

send it back on that, say they agree about that.

18

But then you want it dismissed because you

19
20

say that that issue wasn't fairly raised.

All right.

So I look at the cert petitions; and in

21

their cert petition on page 18, 19, 20, et cetera, it

22

seems to me pretty clear that they're saying the mistake

23

in the Ninth Circuit was ignoring the continuing nature

24

of a trustee's duty under ERISA to review plan

25

investments and eliminate imprudent ones.

You do not, to ­­ to ­­ I can't find a place

11

in your reply ­­ in your reply to their cert petition,

12

in either, where you say they have an incorrect

13

assumption here because you should dismiss this case and

14

never hear it because that isn't what the Ninth Circuit

15

said.

16

Rather, the Ninth Circuit said a different thing.
Now, where ­­ where do you say that?

I

17

couldn't find it.

me that you have waived, in a sense, the argument that

19

they have waived in a different sense.

All right.

21

MR. HACKER:

And if you didn't say it, it seems to

You see the point.
Right.

We ­­ we definitely

22

argued and pointed out, which is on the face of the

23

opinion true, which is the next paragraph of the opinion

24

after the ­­ the "without more" cite that the court

25

recognized a continuing duty.

It acknowledged the

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

existence of a continuing duty, and this is in the ­­

2

our cert opposition and explicitly says, "Therefore, the

3

district court was correct to allow them to assert a

4

changed circumstances theory."

5
6
7
8
9

That's clearly in the cert opp.

On pages 8

through 10, we're explaining ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what you say, I have

this that you said.
The Ninth Circuit held that a statute ­­

10

that "a claim challenging the selection of mutual

11

funds" ­­ da, da, da ­­ "is barred by the six­year

12

statute if the claim challenges funds that were selected

13

more than six years before, and the claim does not

14

allege that any materially new circumstances arose

15

within the previous six years."

16

So that sounds like the very

17

characterization of the Ninth Circuit that they are

18

saying was mistaken.

19

MS. HACKER:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
So it seems as if you are

21

agreeing that the Ninth Circuit made a mistake.

22

agreeing they should have put this in, and I guess you

23

also agreed that in their brief in the Ninth Circuit,

24

they did say, "Edison had a continuing duty to ensure

that each of the plans' investments was and remained

Well, there are a few problems

in that, but most of them just quibbles.

Okay?

First of all, the ­­ the description you

13

read of the cert ­­ from the cert opposition is

14

describing accurately what the Ninth Circuit said with

15

respect to what it was they were arguing.

16

Remember, the changed circumstances theory

17

was introduced by the Plaintiffs' own expert.

18

came into the trial, the judge expressed puzzlement as

19

to why the Plaintiffs were talking about changed

20

circumstances because he thought their claim was going

21

to be what you hear it is today.

MR. HACKER:

There was no circuit law like

3

that, there was no precedent saying that.

4

and this was not Plaintiffs' theory.

And doctor ­­

Plaintiff
It appears

Nelson Wolff, counsel for Plaintiffs,
explains that our theory is not limited to changed
circumstances.

That was Dr. Pomerantz's own theory.

And the court ultimately says, I will hold
the Plaintiffs to whatever Dr. Pomerantz said.
But there's an even clearer answer to this,

14

which is we know that the Plaintiffs did not think

15

themselves limited to proof of changed circumstances

16

because half of the trial, fully half of the trial was a

17

challenge to the money market fund, one of the funds at

18

issue below.

19

And the argument ­­ and the only argument

apply the law insofar as is in the proper procedure to

do it, something like that.

18

MR. HACKER:

That would ­­ I don't disagree

21

The only point I would make is I

22

to the continuing ­­ whenever you hear "continuing

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Hacker, here is what you

6

argued to the Ninth Circuit ­­ what you argued to the

7

Ninth Circuit.

8

challenges to funds added to the plan more than 6 years

9

before this action was filed.

ERISA's 6­year limitations period bars

Then you got exactly what

10

you wanted from the Ninth Circuit with the single

11

exception that the Ninth circuit added a fact, that by

12

the way, that doesn't apply to changed circumstances.

13

Then you described to this Court what you got from the

14

Ninth Circuit, in the terms that Justice Breyer said,

15

which was exactly that the only kind of monitoring claim

16

available to a plaintiff is when there are changed

17

circumstances.

18

And then you file a brief in which you

19

sometimes say that the Ninth Circuit is completely right

20

and then you sometimes purport to be agreeing that the

21

Ninth Circuit was wrong.

22

Now, to me, that's raising a lot of dust for

23

something that is pretty clearly what the Ninth Circuit

24

said, what you asked for, and what is wrong?

25

MR. HACKER:

The last point I was going to

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

make, which I didn't get a chance to get back to it,

2

Justice Breyer, was we do think it's appropriate, if you

3

don't like the language that the Ninth Circuit used, if

4

you it don't read it the way I do, and think that the

5

Ninth Circuit is announcing a categorical rule that says

6

nobody can proceed on a monitoring challenge unless they

approve changed circumstances, that's not the argument

we believe is the correct argument.

that that's required anywhere in our brief.

That's during the periodic

20

We're not resisting the point Justice Scalia raised,

21

that if the plaintiff thinks that something was so

22

galactically imprudent on its face, that any proper,

23

reasonably prudent review process would identify and

24

remove the fund, then that can proceed, or at least it's

25

not barred by the statute of repose.

But it can still be a breach.

MR. HACKER:

basis for challenging the Ninth Circuit's judgment

And there's no basis for

And the analysis, what's going on in the

11

Ninth Circuit opinion ­­ again, if you don't like the

12

language or think it's susceptible to misunderstanding,

13

the point the Ninth Circuit was simply making is one I

14

think this Court should endorse, which is that there is

15

no continuing violations theory.

16

more than simply say there was an imprudent fund one

17

day, and because you have a continuing duty, you

18

therefore have to remove it.

19

A plaintiff has to do

What a plaintiff in that situation has to

20

show, is a violation, a breach, of the continuing duty

21

to monitor, so then the case becomes about what the

22

scope of that duty is.

23

where I do think there is some disagreement between us

24

and Mr. Frederick on that.

25

And I want to make two points

The first is that, and I agree with what

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Ms. Saharsky said, it's absolutely true that there is a

2

fundamental and major difference between the process for

3

selecting funds initially and the process for monitoring

4

existing funds.

5

going through this comprehensive review of the market;

6

when you're monitoring them, you're basically looking

7

for changed circumstances.

8

for.

9

When you're selecting funds, you're

That's what you're reviewing

And the reason for that is the enormous

10

disruption, both to the fiduciaries, the enormous work a

11

fiduciary would have to do if literally every month or

12

literally every quarter ­­ these were periodic quarterly

13

reviews we did.

14

all 40 funds and investigate to see whether that fund

15

was the cheapest available funds that provided the kind

16

of investment profile that fund provided.

17

it for the next fund, and then the next fund, and then

18

the next fund.

19

that's the argument Mr. Frederick is suggesting and you

20

won't find any source of ­­ either under ERISA or trust

21

law or DOL guidance that endorses that.

22

Every quarter you have to go through

Every quarter.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then do

That's the point ­­

He didn't say the

23

cheapest fund.

24

between the retail and the institutional cost.

25

He said there is a stock difference

2

the ­­ is the fees.

3

between ­­ it's not the same thing.

4

not just pushing a button to jump into the institutional

5

share clause ­­ class.

6

second point I want to make generally about the duty to

7

monitor, which I think Mr. Frederick and I fundamentally

8

disagree on, in answer to Justice Kagan's question I

9

believe was, he said it's only the most distant Supreme

But there is still a difference
As I said before,

One of the reasons for that is the

10

Court law school hypothetical that there might ever be a

11

difference between the duty that a fiduciary has in the

12

initial selection process and the duty a fiduciary has

13

with respect to whether or not to remove a fund, that

14

that's just an imaginary kind of situation.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, I don't think he said

16

that.

17

this particular fund, saying what kind of disruption ­­

18

is there any kind of disruption that would be worth the

19

price of holding onto a fund that is the exact same as

20

another fund except that it has much higher fees.

21

he said, as to that particular case, no, there wouldn't

22

be.

23

I asked a very particular question relating to

MR. HACKER:

And

I understood the question to be

24

more ­­ the question and the answer to be more general.

25

But it's even better if you talk about this specific

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:

In the their post trial

23

brief, they said on page 13 ­­ this is Docket No. 381 ­­

24

"By challenging the prudence of maintaining retail share

25

classes of the three name­changed funds, plaintiffs have

55

done what the court" ­­ this is the district court ­­

2

"has forbidden, by attempting to resurrect claims that

3

were properly held barred by the 6­year statute of

4

limitations."

5

Ninth Circuit said, "These claims have been barred by

6

the statute of limitations."

7

On page 15 of the petition appendix, the

We had argued that in our court of appeals

8

brief, that these are proper claims.

9

our cert petition.

We raised it in

There's a conflict for you to

10

resolve between the Second and the Seventh Circuits on

11

the one hand, which say that an ongoing monitoring claim

12

is proper under ERISA, and it resets the statute of

13

limitations, and the three circuits led by the Ninth,

14

the Fourth and the Eleventh that say you only start the

15

limitations period from the initial selection date.

16

So I ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

however.

19

that you can't have every three months, a sort of

20

general market evaluation of whether something should be

21

selected or not.

22

I mean, there's some force to his argument

MR. FREDERICK:

And I think I disavowed

23

that, Justice Sotomayor.

3

more expensive than the institutional share class.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

He says your ­­ your

5

expert would not commit that a ­­ during a prudent

6

monitoring, this would have been caught.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

8

think that the distortion of the record based on what

9

the expert testified was because the expert was

10

concerned about running afoul of the judge's summary

11

judgment order, which had said, I'm not hearing anything

12

about the 1999 funds unless you can tell me that the

13

changes were so significant that that change would

14

warrant a review of the type you would do from an

15

initial review.

16

Look, there are a lot of interesting fact

17

questions.

18

All this Court needs to do and all we ask you to do, is

19

to rule that our claims for imprudent monitoring were

20

within the statute of limitations because they were

21

within the 6­year period.

22

We lost on summary judgment.

24

fact.

This Court does not need to resolve them.

The case should be remanded.

If you want to decide a little bit more

2

about what the content of this monitoring duty ­­ you

3

can say look at expenses, look at performance, look at

4

publicly available information ­­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I, for one, am not ready

6

to do that, because I'm not a trier of fact for what a

7

reasonable investor would do ­­

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

I ­­ Justice Kennedy was

absolutely right when he said it's what a reasonably

10

prudent investor would do, and that's the standard.

11

That's all we've been arguing for and that may be

12

different in different circumstances ­­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not ­­ I'm very ­­ I

14

don't, as you may know, I have just a little invested so

15

I don't know much.

16

when they were made aware of the institutional class,

17

that I would have looked at my portfolio and seen if I

18

had retail class.

But it seems to me that in 2003,

19

MR. FREDERICK:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, we think ­­
Now, whether it was

21

prudent to stay in that because of expenses or other

22

things, I don't know.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, the district courts

24

found the case easy as to the 2002 funds, but felt

25

constrained as to the 1999 funds because they had been

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

selected before the 6­year period of the limitations.

2

And that's why, if this case goes back to the district

3

court, we believe we have a strong argument that as to

4

the imprudence of maintaining the 1999 funds within the

5

6­year limitations period, we have a strong argument.

6

And ­­ And just to take one point of fact,

7

Justice Sotomayor, there was a fund added in 1999, an

8

Allianz fund; in footnote 7 of the red brief, they say,

9

finally they got around to getting rid of it in 2011.

10

So for 10 years, the 6 years before the lawsuit was

11

filed starting in 2001, in 2011 beneficiaries had to

12

incur costs of as much as 37 percent more.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
