Mr. Clement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAOL D. CLEMENT

10

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Going through security as part of the egress

12

process is a classic postliminary activity that is

13

non­compensable under the Portal­to­Portal Act.

14

materially similar to the process of checking out at the

15

end of the day or waiting in line to do so, which is a

16

quintessential postliminary activity under the Act.

17

The Ninth Circuit erred in treating this

It is

18

time as integral and indispensable to a principal

19

activity and Respondent's position that the time is

20

compensable without regard to whether it is an integral

21

or indispensable activity is more problematic still.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement ­­ excuse me ­­

can I give you a hypo?
Suppose that there's an employer with cash
registers, and there's a very extensive process for

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

closing out the cash registers, and that extensive

2

process is to protect against theft.

3

that concern, you could close out a cash register much

4

more quickly.

5

for casino dealers, you know, that there's, like, a

6

20­minute process which is essentially an antitheft

7

security process.

8

shift when the cashier goes off duty.

9
10
11

If it weren't for

Or the same for bank tellers or the same

And it happens at the end of the

What's the difference between that case and
going through security in ­­ at Amazon?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think one difference

12

is not ­­ I'm not crystal clear that that time would not

13

be non­compensable because I think that's sort of the

14

winding down period, which is, I think, with ­­ at least

15

potentially within the ambit of preliminary and

16

postliminary activities.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you know, by the way?

I

18

mean, before you get on to that, do you know how that's

19

treated under the law?

20

was that this kind of period would be treated as

21

compensable.

22

Because I guess my assumption

But if that's not right, let me know.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it's a problem with

23

hypotheticals because I don't know that that particular

24

case has arisen.

25

close question under the Act, because you do have this

I would think that would be actually a

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

notion under the Portal­to­Portal Act that preliminary

2

activities and postliminary activities are

3

non­compensable.

4

Clemens, which used the term "preliminary," that

5

included the sort of wind up process and might well

6

include this sort of wind down process at the work

7

station.

8
9

And that, if you go back to Mt.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Couldn't you say that

closing down the cash register is part of the job?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You could.
But getting yourself

12

inspected as you leave ­­ as you leave the place of

13

business is not part of the job.

14

it's just part of the job.

15
16
17
18
19

MR. CLEMENT:

The other case where

You could definitely say that,

Justice Scalia, and I meant to get that ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

You could not only say it;

it seems to me true.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, all the better, then, to

20

say it, which is that this then becomes an easier case

21

than that because it is part of the egress process,

22

which is really the process of getting from your ­­

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But part of Justice

24

Kagan's hypothetical was that the 20 minutes or the 30

25

minutes is just for antitheft purposes.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Or at least I'll

Official

interpret her hypothetical that way.

2

purposes.

3

forth are turned up.

4

Just for antitheft

Otherwise the cashiers ­­ the records and so

But just for antitheft protection, you need

5

the 20 or 30 minutes.

6

hypothetical that way, then it seems to me to be the

7

same.

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

If I can interpret the

I don't think it's the same.

I think it's an arguable case under the Act that it

10

still might be postliminary, but I think if you look at

11

the cases that are out there, the courts have struggled

12

a bit with the preliminary and postliminary activities

13

that take place at the work station.

14

Where I don't think they've struggled until

15

the Ninth Circuit decision here is when you're talking

16

about time after you've left the primary work station

17

and when you're in the process of going to the doors.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That would seem to make it

19

depend on a complete fortuity.

20

have the cashier walk from the ­­ the ­­ with her tray

21

to the manager's station and do the same thing there on

22

the way out the door, there would be one answer, and if

23

she does it at the cashier's station, it would be

24

another answer.

25

sensible.

You know, if I ­­ if I

And that seems not particularly

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, there are some not

2

particularly sensible results under the Portal­to­Portal

3

Act because things do turn on where activities take

4

place vis­à­vis walking time.

5

this an easier case than your hypothetical is the exit

6

screenings are a logical part of the egress process.

7

The other side in this case tries to raise the specter

8

of lawn mowing being uncompensated and car washing being

9

uncompensated, but no employer requires to you take a

10
11

But I do think what makes

couple of swipes at a car on your way out the door.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Clement, is it ­­ is

12

it irrelevant that we're told here that because there

13

are not enough security checkers and because all the

14

shifts get out at the same time, what could be a

15

five­minute process turns out to be 25 minutes, 25

16

minutes of the workers' time, and 20 of those allegedly

17

would not occur if the employer had ­­ provided

18

sufficient staffing.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, ultimately,

20

we don't think that allegation is relevant here.

21

it is just an allegation.

22

that it's not relevant here is twofold.

23

thing we know from the Portal­to­Portal Act and the

24

pre­Portal­to­Portal Act cases is the pure length of

25

time of something does not take it out of preliminary or

Now,

But the reason that I say

7
Alderson Reporting Company

One, the one

Official

1
2

postliminary activities.
If you go back to the Jewell Ridge case and

3

look at Justice Jackson's dissent, he makes crystal

4

clear that the travel time at issue there was over an

5

hour total, and nonetheless the clear import of

6

Portal­to­Portal Act is to treat that hour as

7

non­compensable time.

8

The second reason why I think this waiting

9

time at the exit would be particularly a bad candidate

10

for treating as compensable just because it was

11

relatively long is because it's not uniform 25 minutes.

12

And so it's directly analogous to the time that was ­­

13

people had to wait to go in and punch the clock at the

14

pottery factory in Mt. Clemens.

15

And even the Mt. Clemens Court didn't treat

16

the waiting time to punch in as compensable.

17

think part of the reason was that it didn't really make

18

any sense.

19

through, but that would create all sorts of anomalies

20

where the first person who got through would get

21

treated ­­ would get paid for eight more minutes than

22

the last person that got through.

And I

It took eight minutes for everybody to get

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's a principal

activity?

13

define what a principal activity is.

think, isn't a principal activity work that benefits the

15

employer in some way?

16

How is it defined?

MR. CLEMENT:

Because pre or

No, Justice Sotomayor.

And I

think it's important to get two concepts separate.

are required by the employer for the employer's benefit

That's the

But principal activities is a separate and

24

more demanding test under the Portal­to­Portal Act.

25

the way I'd think about the statute is the Fair Labor

9
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

Standards Act makes all work presumptively compensable.

2

And then only when you get to something that is arguably

3

postliminary or preliminary do you have to ask a

4

question that involves principal activities.

5

you have compensable work and it's not even arguably

6

preliminary or postliminary, it's compensable without

7

regard to the Portal­to­Portal Act.

8
9

Because if

But when you get to the Portal­to­Portal
Act, then you have to look, is this a preliminary and

10

postliminary activity.

11

presumptively noncompensable unless it's integral and

12

indispensable to a principal activity.

13

And if it is, then it's

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let's ­­ let's take

14

Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.

15

that it takes 25 minutes to check out and that it would

16

be very easy for the employer to hire a few more

17

checkers and make it 5 minutes.

18

the fact.

19

Let's ­­ let's assume

Just assume that that's

Why isn't the long line in ­­ caused by very

20

few checkers for the benefit of the employer?

21

the benefit of the employer to hire fewer checkers.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

It's for

It might be for the benefit of

23

the employer in that set of circumstances, Justice

24

Kennedy, but that doesn't make it not postliminary

25

activity and not compensable.

And if you look at the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

universe of all noncompensable time under the

2

Portal­to­Portal Act, I think in every instance you

3

could say if the employer only did more, he could

4

reduce ­­ he or she, it could reduce that time.

5

And so, if you go back ­­

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He could move his plant,

7

for example, to be closer to the city where the

8

employees live, right?

He should move his

And you can ticket from the commuting time to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the

Is it ­­ is it always

19

irrelevant to the analysis that it's for or not for the

20

benefit of the employer?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

It is irrelevant for the

22

Portal­to­Portal Act analysis.

23

irrelevant to the analysis at all because the fact that

24

it is for the employer's benefit is part of what makes

25

it compensable work presumptively or work under the Fair

And as I said, it's not

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Labor Standards Act.
But when you get to applying the

3

Portal­to­Portal Act, that is activity that even though

4

it's work, even though it's required by the employer,

5

and even though it's for the benefit of the employer, is

6

nonetheless noncompensable by the terms of the

7

Portal­to­Portal Act.

8

the ­­

9

And if I could just continue

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

That's ­­

10

that's not quite right, because if the employer requires

11

you to put on a particular outfit that you can't do the

12

work without, we've said that's compensable.

13
14
15

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think you have a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So ­­ and ­­ but donning

17

out that element from this analysis.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Sotomayor, I don't

19

think there's a case of this Court that says just

20

because the employer requires something that would

21

otherwise be superfluous that it therefore becomes

22

integral and indispensable.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

Putting on clothes to

But ­­ but take something

5

where a particular employer has an idiosyncratic view

6

and actually wants their employers ­­ employees to have

7

a certain color smock or a certain piece of equipment

8

that's not actually particularly integral and

9

indispensable to anything.

10

I don't think anything in this Court's cases

11

would say just because the employer required it, it is

12

therefore compensable.

13

And I think if you go back to the

14

quintessential example of something that is postliminary

15

and noncompensable, the time clocks, the checking out

16

process, all of that is required by the employer and for

17

the employer's benefit.

18

And so I don't think you can meaningfully

19

distinguish the exit screening from those

20

quintessentially postliminary noncompensable things.

JUSTICE BREYER:

ways of doing it.

16

this way.

plenty of things ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

If I can think of a way at

22

the end of the day that the employer could have done it

23

by saving a little more time or something like that,

24

then it's postliminary.

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, if it's otherwise

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

postliminary, it doesn't come outside of that exception

2

and become a principal activity.

3

to make here.

4

sharpening in King Packing, for example, really is

5

indispensable.

6

without sharp knives.

7

And I think two points

One is, you know, I think the knife

You can't run a butchering operation

I think you can perfectly well run a

8

warehouse facility without egress security.

9

these are different.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I think

Actually, Amazon, I don't

11

think you can.

12

a system of inventory control that betters everybody else

13

in the business.

14

is that it knows where every toothbrush in the warehouse

15

is.

16

to what it requires its employees to do as, for example,

17

the ­­ I'm going back to my hypos ­­ but the person who

18

closes out the cash register, the person who closes out

19

the bank teller operation, is that this is sort of a

20

necessary part of what ­­ of what the ­­ the folks who

21

do all the stocking and the unshelving and shelving do

22

at Amazon.

23

I mean, what makes Amazon, Amazon?

It's

And what's really important to Amazon

And that's just as integral to what Amazon does and

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I guess I would beg to

24

differ, Justice Kagan.

25

in the Amazon facility is barcoded and the like, and

I think, certainly, everything

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

everybody knows where everything is, but there's always

2

the possibility that somebody would not barcode an

3

incoming item at all and put it in their pocket.

4

Now, if they're doing that, they're not

5

discharging their principal activities, and if they're

6

detected on the way out, I mean, that might help keep

7

the next person on mission, but that doesn't make it

8

integral and indispensable to discharging the primary

9

job duty.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose that it is also

11

necessary to Amazon's business that it know how many

12

hours each of its workers has worked, so it knows how

13

much to pay them and doesn't pay them more, right?

14

And ­­ and yet, there's no doubt whatever, is there,

15

that punching in and punching out is not ­­ is ­­ is

16

preliminary and postliminary, right?

17

MR. CLEMENT:

I hope there's no doubt about

18

that, Justice Scalia.

19

security screenings are just the modern ­­ modern

20

analogue of that.

21

employer's insistence and for the employer's benefit,

MR. GANNON:

2

please the Court:

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The Portal­to­Portal Act generally accepted

4

from mandatory compensation the activities that are

5

associated with a process by which employees arrive on

6

the employer's premises at the entrance to the portal and

7

get to the place where they perform their principal work

8

activities at the beginning of the day, and then the

9

process by which they leave at the end of the day and

10
11

get to the exits.
We think that security screenings here are

12

noncompensable because they are postliminary activities,

13

and they are not integral and indispensable to the

14

employees' principal work activities.

I don't think that we have any

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

particular examples of searches in mind.

2

cases that deal with compensable searches.

3

the question there would be whether the activity has so

4

fundamentally changed the nature of what's going on that

5

it no longer resembles the ordinary process of checking

6

out.

7

There aren't
But I think

The reason why we think ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You can't think of an

8

example, then, where a security check, an exit security

9

check, would be compensable?

10

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think it would probably

11

have to be a type of search that is so dramatically

12

different, more intrusive, more time­consuming, the

13

search itself, not just the time waiting in line, that

14

it's fundamentally transformed the nature of the

15

activity.

16

examples that are suggested in the briefs, like drug

17

testing, you could analogize that in some way to an

18

anti­theft search.

19

with a person who works in a pharmaceutical

20

manufacturing facility, have they taken the

21

pharmaceuticals.

22

the way out.

23

So I think to the extent that some of the

One of the hypotheticals has to do

The employer may want to test them on

And I'd say that drug testing is not the

24

type of thing that is normally associated with entering

25

and leaving the property.

It's not the ordinary course

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of checking in and checking out, waiting in line to do

2

so, the types of things that the Labor Department was

3

thinking about in 1947 when it adopted the interpretive

4

regulation that gave those examples.

5

And I also think that drug testing is not

6

the sort of thing that's classically associated with the

7

entrances and the exits.

8

usually done somewhere else.

9

security and safety screenings, the most of which I

It's the sort of thing that is
And that's different from

10

understand Respondents concede are not actually going to

11

be compensable.

12

And so we think that those are the two

13

reasons why in this case this looks like something that

14

is both postliminary ­­ it happens as part of a process

15

of getting out, it is ­­ it happens at the door, at the

16

portal or near there ­­ and it is not integral and

17

indispensable.

18

were at issue in Steiner or in King Packing or in IBP,

19

because the employees when they are on the work floor

20

doing their job, surely they do have access to

21

merchandise.

22

you pointed out, Justice Kagan, that they not take the

23

merchandise.

24

where the merchandise is.

25

It is different from the activities that

It is of course important to Amazon, as

Amazon and Integrity Staffing want to know

But the idea that this benefits the employer

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or is required by the employer isn't enough to make it

2

compensable because, as Mr. Clement was just saying,

3

that's the test for whether something was work.

4

what was the test under Mt. Clemens, and Congress

5

excepted from that a class of activities, preliminary

6

and postliminary activities, that are noncompensable.

7

Travel time and preliminary and postliminary activities

8

like time clocks, punching in and punching out, that's

9

required by the employer.

10

That's

It benefits the employer.

That's not enough to make it compensable.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But is the idea, then,

12

Mr. Gannon, just ­­ you know, it's basically a door

13

test?

14

just to have a door test, exits and entrances.

15

I mean, portal to portal.

MR. GANNON:

It might make sense

I think that it has ­­ to be

16

more precise about it, I think that canonically most of

17

the activities are going to be associated with the

18

process of getting in and out.

19

were the things that were at issue in the

20

Portal­to­Portal Act cases that Congress was effectively

21

reversing when it adopted the Portal­to­Portal Act.

22

I think it's the continuous workday rule that's going to

23

make it ­­it makes sure that it happens only at the

24

beginning and the end of the day.

25

more precise about it, though, the way the statute is

Those were the ­­ those

21
Alderson Reporting Company

And

I think that, to be

Official

phrased, it talks about these being activities that

2

occur before the principal work activities begin at the

3

end of the day or after they cease.

4

preliminary if you've already started doing your

5

principal activities and it's not postliminary if you

haven't already ceased them.

Something isn't

indispensable and ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can we write this case

11

without discussing whether or not this is for the

12

benefit of the employer?

13

MR. GANNON:

Or do we have to address that?
Well, I think that it's always

14

going to be for the benefit of the employer if it comes

15

up in the context of the Portal­to­Portal Act, because

16

we wouldn't be concerned about whether the exception ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you're saying that that is

really not at all helpful or necessary for the analysis?

I don't think it is, because

that's the antecedent question about whether it would

have been compensable under the FLSA.

benefit the employer, if it's not required by the

23

employer, it wouldn't have been work, you don't need to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you can ­­ so we assume

that it's for the benefit of the employer.
MR. GANNON:

Yes.

I think that it almost

5

certainly is always going to be for the benefit of the

6

employer, just like time clocks are, just like you could

7

say the requirement in Tennessee Coal and Jewell Mining,

8

the mine cases, that employees were required to ride

9

from the face ­­ from the portal of the mine, down to

10

the face where they are going to be working, they were

11

required to ride in the ore skiff ­­ in the ore skip,

12

and presumably that benefitted the employer for all

13

sorts of reasons.

14

for people to walk.

And that's not enough to ensure ­­

Can I give you a different

20

on real life circumstances.

his cases and that was their principal activity, but had

his clerks come early in order to cut his grapefruit and

of extra security equipment that nobody really thinks is

important but the employer demands that you do, and they

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. THIERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

We agree that there are levels of analysis

5

and the first level is, is this work; and under 785.7 of

6

the regs this is work because it's an activity required

7

for the benefit of the employer.

8

the question then becomes, is it a principal activity.

Not whether it is integral and indispensable, but is it

Having said it's work,

10

a principal activity, because we never get to integral

activity.

Just ­­ before you get to

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just a few points in rebuttal.
I'd like to start with what is the linchpin

13

of principal activities.

14

obviously a term introduced to the Act by the

15

Portal­to­Portal Act.

The regulations define that as

16

work of consequence.

Now, my friend would like you to

17

say that the linchpin is whether it's required.

18

why that makes no sense at all.

19

the Fair Labor Standards Act in the first instance is

20

determined by whether it's required.

21

much ­­ do much good for Congress to say, don't worry

22

about that, employers.

So what is your response?
MR. CLEMENT:

Especially as my friend

describes drug testing, it doesn't sound like any

11

logical part of the egress process.

12

why those things are not covered.

13

not because ­­

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you, certainly,

15

Mr. Clement, make it part of the egress process.

17

as though that's part of what the Portal­to­Portal Act

I

Why not make it part of the egress process and

24

nothing to do with the egress process and say you've got

One other point of clarification on this,

16

Justice Scalia, you were exactly right when you said the

17

785 series, which they want to rely on, are about hours

18

worked under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

19

what's in the universe of things that are potentially

20

subject to the exceptions of the Portal­to­Portal Act.

21

The principal activities is defined in the

22

regulations in the 790 series, which is all about the

23

Portal­to­Portal Act and 790.A is helpfully entitled

Not anything that the employer requires, but work of

You still have to ask the

final question, which is whether it's integral and

12

Now, my friends really don't want to talk

13

about that, I think, with good reason because this

14

clearly is not integral and indispensable.

15

think you can make not stealing indispensable to the

employee has to stay at their work station and while a

Alderson Reporting Company

There is another

1

20­minute process goes on, that's the employer requiring

2

them to be on the premises for an extra 20 minutes.

3

That's much more like being engaged to wait than waiting

4

to engage.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I gave it to you two ways.

6

And one was at your work station and the other was an

7

employer, who knowing that there was this ingress/egress

8

rule, made it part of the ingress/egress process.

9

that's my other question repeated again.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

So

But ­­ but even as to the

11

modified hypothetical, if you have to stay on the

12

employer's premises for an extra 20 minutes, that's

13

closer to being engaged to wait as opposed to waiting to

14

engage.

15

takes 25 minutes.

16

you're in the very back of the line.

17

the many reasons not to adopt their rule is you don't

want to create an incentive for every employee to try to
