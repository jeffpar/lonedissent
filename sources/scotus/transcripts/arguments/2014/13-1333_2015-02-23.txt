CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 13­1333, Coleman v. Tollefson.
Mr. Shanmugam.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Under the three strikes provision of the

11

Prison Litigation Reform Act, a prisoner who has three

12

prior dismissals on prior occasions must pay the full

13

filing fee before bringing suit.

14

strikes provision specifies what types of dismissal

15

qualify as strikes, it does not expressly specify when a

16

dismissal counts as a strike.

17

While the three

The better view is that a dismissal does not

18

count until it becomes final on appeal.

19

consistent both with the text of the three strikes

20

provision and with the PLRA's underlying purposes.

21
22
23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That view is

Does that include a

petition for cert or is it only the first level appeal?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

The time for the filing of a

24

petition for cert would count under our view, which is

25

to say that a dismissal would not qualify as a strike

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

until that time is complete.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So until there's a

3

petition filed and it's denied or until the time expires

4

to file the petition.

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is correct.

And that

6

is a quite familiar rule, Justice Ginsburg.

7

rule that this Court has applied with regard to the

8

running of limitations periods for habeas petitions, for

9

example, in Clay v. United States.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sure, it is.

It is the

But if ­­ if

11

that were the case, why ­­ why would the statute have to

12

refer separately to dismissals for frivolousness by the

13

district court or by the court of appeals?

14

just ­­ it could have just said, if he's had a petition

15

dismissed for frivolousness period, and that would mean

16

it would have to go all the way up.

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You could

Justice Scalia ­­
It separately says by the

district court or by the court of appeals.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, that is ­­
The ­­ the dismissal is

7

simply not final until the court of appeals acts, and

8

that's one dismissal.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But there would still be two

dismissals.

11

12

And let me explain how our interpretation

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

I understand what

13

you're saying, but it doesn't make any sense.

14

doesn't make any sense for Congress to want a finality

15

rule and yet to count it twice.

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It

I don't think that there is

17

any inconsistency.

18

In our view, the critical phrase in the statute is the

19

phrase "prior occasion."

20

triggered at the point at which a dismissal is entered.

21

But in our view, the occasion is not complete until the

22

appellate process has run its course.

23

And let me explain why that is so.

And to be sure, an occasion is

So in a case in which a district court

24

enters a qualifying dismissal, that is to say, a

25

dismissal on the ground that the action is frivolous or

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

malicious or fails to state a claim, the occasion is

2

complete only when the appellate process runs its

3

course.

4

enters a qualifying dismissal on those similar grounds,

5

a separate occasion is initiated by the dismissal and

6

it, too, ends when further review is complete. Now what

7

that means ­­

8
9

And so, too, when the court of appeals, if it

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do you say that?

do you get that out of the word "occasion"?

I would ­­

10

I would think "occasion" means at any time prior,

11

whether it's at the court ­­ whether it's at the

12

district court or the court of appeals.

13

it.

14

mean what you suggest, period?

15

Where

You ­­ you read

Why can "occasion" only mean what you suggest?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Or

We don't believe that it

16

could only mean what we suggest, which is to say that we

17

don't think that the text precludes an interpretation

18

under which the occasion is coterminous with the act of

19

dismissal.

20

possible interpretation of the statutory language.

21

We simply don't think that is the only

For one thing, we think that it is notable

22

that the statute does not provide that a mere affirmance

23

of a district court dismissal qualifies as a distinct

24

strike.

25

So, in other words, in a case in which a

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

district court dismisses on one of the specified grounds

2

and then the court of appeals simply affirms, I think

3

everyone would agree that there is only one strike.

9

When would the court of appeals simply affirm and when

would it say "appeal dismissed"?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

So, Justice Ginsburg, when a

12

district court dismisses for failure to state a claim, I

13

think that the ordinary course would be for a court of

14

appeals to affirm.

15

dismissals on the ground that the underlying action is

16

frivolous or malicious or fails to state a claim, we

17

think that the failure to state a claim ground really

18

only properly applies on the district court level.

19

While the statute refers to

To come at it from another direction, the

20

circumstances in which courts of appeals dismiss appeals

21

rather than affirming are circumstances in which the

22

appeal itself is frivolous or malicious.

23

circumstance in which a court of appeals merely affirms,

24

there is no discrete strike at the court of appeals

25

level.

7
Alderson Reporting Company

So in a

Official

1

And in our view, to get back to Justice

2

Scalia's question, that fact, the fact that a mere

3

affirmance does not count separately, in our view,

4

strongly suggests that the dismissal and the ensuing

5

appeal should be viewed as a single unit.

6

circumstance in which a court of appeals action counts

7

as a distinct strike is when the appeal itself is

8

frivolous or malicious ­­

one of the appealing points in your argument that you

there are not a lot of cases, as the Federal government

fact it is because of a failure to state a claim, so has

18

more merit than one of the frivolous ones, I suppose the

20

we're addressing would totally go away.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The

So, neither Respondents, nor

permissible solution.

District Court cases where District Courts have entered

stays.

We have identified a couple of

I would respectfully submit that the concept of

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a stay is a little bit counterintuitive in this context.

2

Because, I think what a District Court would essentially

3

be doing is saying that it isstaying the grounds on which

4

it disposes of the case.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but that's a

6

problem that is always presented when you have to ask a

7

District Court to stay its own judgment.

8

also ask the Court of Appeals, right?

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But you can

Right, but you're not really

10

staying the dismissal in that circumstance.

11

would really be doing is staying the consequences of the

12

dismissal.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What you

No, you just stay the

14

judgment.

15

typical reason you ask for a stay is because the

16

judgment is going to have some very adverse consequences

17

that should be suspended pending appeal.

18

Because the judgment ­­ I mean, that's the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

I'm a little

19

confused here.

20

prisoner can't file because of the third strike.

21

is no complaint to stay, and there's no judgment to

22

stay.

23

There's no judgment to be entered if the

MR. SHANMUGAM:

There

I think, Justice Sotomayor,

24

if I'm understanding the Chief Justice correctly, that

25

what the Chief Justice is suggesting is that a District

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court when it enters the potential third strike it

2

somehow enter a stay of the disposition and what I'm

3

submitting is a little bit counterintuitive about that,

4

is that what the District Court would essentially be

5

doing is entering the dismissal because after all, the

6

dismissal would need to take effect but at the same time

7

saying that in essence the collateral consequences of that

8
9
10
11

dismissal are not immediately going to take effect.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The remedy will be

stayed in effect, of the third strike.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, but the only remedy is

12

the disposition of the case and so, again, I think that

13

that is why this idea really hasn't gotten ­­

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are you suggesting

15

that the District Court cannot stay the disposition of

16

the case?

17

or going to be asked to review it can't stay it?

18

Or that a Court of Appeals asked to review it

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, but the only

19

consequence of the case here is the actual act of

20

entering the dismissal.

21

in which, for instance a court affirmatively provides

22

relief, whether it's a monetary judgment or injunctive

23

relief, and then says that that is not going to take

24

effect until the appellate process is complete.

25

So this is not a circumstance

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It says the dismissal will

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not take effect.

2

know, we think you deserve to be dismissed but we’re going

3

to enter a stay so you can go up and see if we were right.

4

Why can't it say the dismissal ­­ you

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yeah, again, I don't think

5

that there is a lot of precedent for this even in the

6

jurisdictions that have adopted respondents or the

7

Federal government's interpretation.

8

say one ­­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But let me just

I actually don't even

10

­­ I hadn't considered this, because we ­­

11

appellate courts have no jurisdiction until there's a

12

final judgment.

13

standard that would be met and there's no anything

14

standard that would be met.

15

There's no 54(b) ­­ there's no 54(b)

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I mean, in essence what you

16

have to do is to prevent the very judgment from becoming

17

a judgment, because of course at the moment ­­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry, isn't

19

that what stays do?

20

the judgment and by doing so you stay any collateral

21

consequences of it?

22

They suspend the effectiveness of

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, what they tend

23

to do, Mr. Chief Justice, I think, is to really stay the

24

relief that is being provided until the appellate

25

process runs its course.

4

The problem here is not

The problem here is the next case, if there

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that is correct.

And to

5

get back to Justice Scalia's question, because I just want

6

to make sure that all of the consequences of the various

7

interpretations are on the table.

8

are actually two sets of pernicious consequences here.

9

The first is the one that you

I think that there

10

identified here, which I think is a problem both with

11

respondent's and the Federal government's

12

interpretation, which is what to do in a circumstance in

13

which a prisoner is effectively barred as a result of an

14

erroneous third strike, a third strike that is reversed or

15

modified.

16

I think with respondent's

17

interpretation, there is a much more fundamental

18

anomaly, which is this anomaly of precluding appeals of

19

dismissals that count as the third strike.

20

are not arguing today ­­

And so again we

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought in this case

22

there was no such preclusion.

23

Appeals said, yeah, we'll take the appeal on the strike.

24

So that's ­­ that's ­­ you can't urge that issue because

25

you prevailed on it.

I thought that the Court of

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But that is a problem,

2

Justice Ginsburg, that I think inheres in the

3

interpretative question that is before the Court.

4

certainly true that petitioner is not in that position.

5

In other words, we're not here trying to get the right

6

to appeal from the third strike dismissal.

7

think that it is a problem that has to be dealt with in

8

construing the statutory provision and it’s a problem that

9

has been recognized by every court.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It is

But I do

But it has to be dealt

11

with under anybody's interpretation.

12

which you must, that in one case there can be two

13

strikes, then if there's a second case, a third case, or

14

no, a second case, but a third strike at the District

15

Court level, you still have to face the question of

16

whether there's a right to appeal ­­

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Once you admitted,

But, Justice Sotomayor,

18

under our interpretation, all of these anomalies are

19

dealt with for the simple reason that you wait until the

20

end of the appellate process and even those courts, those

21

two Courts of Appeals that have gone the other way on

22

this issue have recognized this anomaly.

23

only respondents who think that this anomaly is no big

24

deal.

25

It's really

Now, there have been various solutions

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

devised to this problem.

2

Circuit and Federal government have all come up with

3

different interpretations of the relevant statutory

4

language in order to address the problem.

5

The Sixth Circuit, the Seventh

I want to specifically address the Federal

6

government's proposed interpretation, because no one

7

before this Court is defending the exact reasoning of

8

either the Sixth Circuit or the Seventh Circuit.

9

Federal government argues that the phrase "prior

The

10

occasion" should be construed to mean a prior dismissal

11

in a different case.

12

anomaly, but we simply don't think that you can get that

13

interpretation out of the phrase "prior occasion."

14

so while there may be textual ambiguity here,

15

and I would certainly acknowledge as I did to

16

Justice Scalia that the text of the statute does not

17

unambiguously preclude respondent's interpretation, we

18

do believe that it unambiguously precludes the Federal

19

government’s interpretation.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, that certainly addresses this

And

Are you saying the

21

government is being illogical or inconsistent, because

22

if strike number 3 is a District Court ruling, the

23

government says, well, there's no bar to your appealing

24

that.

25

Court suit, and you would say that that's just illogical.

There's just a bar for filing a new District

15
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we think that that is

2

something that Congress could logically have done.

3

simply don't think there is any footing in the statutory

4

language for that distinction.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If prior occasion

means

6

what it means, then there's only two strikes anyway

7

because there was or two prior cases or two prior ­­

8
9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Under our interpretation,

that is certainly true and, of course, it bears

10

emphasizing that this is the interpretation of the

11

overwhelming majority of lower courts who have considered

12

the issue.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

By the way, how many of

14

those courts count the time or rely on the time for

15

cert?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

You know, I'm not sure that

17

all of the Court of Appeals opinions have expressly

18

dealt with that issue simply because the cases haven't

19

quite been postured in that position.

20

that rule makes sense because that is the ordinary rule

21

that is applied for instance when this Court is

22

construing statutes that expressly require finality on

23

appeal, and that's the Clay versus United States case

24

that I referenced earlier.

25

We think that

Of course that time is not likely to be all

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that extensive particularly in cases in which the

2

petitions plainly lack merit the time to resolution of

3

petitions of that variety is typically relatively short.

4

But my point here is simply that under our

5

interpretation, there really have been no identified

6

problems with administrability and after all ­­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why not?

I mean, what they

8

argue is if we take your interpretation, it has to be final

9

to become a strike, all that takes time, and if you have

10

a really real frequent filer during that year, perhaps

11

you will file 38 more cases or maybe a hundred and there

12

will be no way to stop him really.

13

for the ­­ you know, I mean, you see the problem.

You'll have to pay

On the other hand, the evil that you're

worried about, which is that there is a reversal of a

4

reported cases in which that has occurred.

5

6

been modifications, and those modifications would also

7

be cases where someone under the interpretations on the

8

other side would go from having three strikes to two

10

It's not a null set.

Even the Federal

12

has been identified is this supposed floodgates problem

13

that's going to ensue under our interpretation where a

14

prisoner, on the eve of a third strike, is suddenly

15

going to come in with a flurry of lawsuits.

16

note at the outset, that that is a potential problem

17

really with any interpretation.

18

I think really the only vice that

I would

In other words, once you set the rules for

that that problem really disappears under any

seems to have been borne out.

that, Justice Scalia.
First of all, even under Respondent's

interpretation, where a prisoner has two strikes, a

12

prisoner could come in with a flurry of lawsuits, and it

seems to be undisputed that you assess whether or not a

And so a prisoner could

there's a reason why this problem hasn't borne out in

provisions of the PLRA.

The government has granted that with

7

considerable one in which of course applies to

And the question really is whether

10

ensuring that a prisoner, in fact, had three valid

11

dismissals for pursuing meritless claims.

12

And, of course, we have a statute here that

13

does not specifically address that issue, and there are

14

plenty of statutes that address that issue in both

15

directions.

16

those members of the Court who are interested in

legislative history that speaks to this issue.

18

And we also have no legislative history for

And so the real question we would submit is

19

that if the Court agrees with us that the language of

20

the statute is at least ambiguous, which interpretation

21

avoids anomalous consequences and leads to a rule that

22

is easy for lower courts to administer?

23

The great virtue of our interpretation is

24

that once a prisoner has three strikes, the prisoner

25

always has three strikes.

You don't have this specter

21
Alderson Reporting Company

1

of the possibility that a prisoner could go from having

2

three strikes one day to having two strikes or fewer the

3

next.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you know if any of

5

those courts, the majority of the courts except for two,

circuit courts figure out administrative ­­ the ease of

administrative rules.

10
11

for addressing things your way?

And ­­ and

How many of them thought of it as

just being easier to do?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that when you

12

look at the court of appeals' opinions that have gone

13

our way, a number of them have recognized that the text

14

is ambiguous.

15

and the Federal government suggest, somehow disregarding

16

the language of the statute.

17

So they have not just been, as Respondents

The Fourth Circuit in the Henslee case

19

said that, "The phrase prior occasion may refer to a

20

single moment or to a continuing event to an appeal

independent of the underlying action, or to the

22

continuing claim, inclusive both of the action and of

23

its appeal."

24

argument we're making today.

25

And that's, of course, precisely the

But with regard to administrability, I just

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

want to be clear about how this works, because this is

2

obviously a very important practical issue for district

3

courts.

4

Under our interpretation, all that a

5

district court, or for that matter a court of appeals,

6

need do is to look to see whether in a prior case there

7

has been a determination that a prisoner has three

8

strikes.

9

the analysis.

If, in fact, that is so, that is the end of
And indeed, our understanding is that in

10

many jurisdictions, the district court clerk's offices

11

actually keep lists of people who have been subject to

12

the three strikes prohibition.

13

There's a decision from the Western District

14

of Louisiana that refers to the keeper of the three

15

strikes list, and our understanding is that that is

16

actually a fairly common practice.

17

where a prisoner has not previously been subject to the

18

three strikes provision, it will be relatively easy, and

19

it's a familiar task for a district court to make the

20

determination whether a prisoner's prior dismissals are

21

final on appeal.

22

And, of course,

Under Respondent's and the Federal

23

government's interpretations by contrast, there is no

24

such ease of application because a court will not be

25

able to be sure that a prisoner, in fact, has three

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

strikes even if the prisoner has previously been barred.

2

And under either of the interpretations on the other

3

side, you will have to figure out what to do in a

4

situation in which a third strike dismissal has been

5

reversed or even modified.

know that there's even one of those.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, but, of course, under

the statute, the dismissal no longer qualifies even if

the prisoner doesn't obtain relief.

everyone agrees that if there is either a reversal or

So the plain language, both in the "was

helpful.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So

You know, I guess what

15

I'm not quite sure about in your answer to my question,

16

Mr. Lindstrom, is, if I understand you right, and tell

17

me if I don't, you're basically saying that we look to

18

these background principles and we decide that a strike

19

doesn't happen if something is reversed on appeal, so a

20

strike is kind of dependent on what happens on appeal.

21

But when you say that, aren't you kind of giving up your

22

best argument?

23

the notion of a strike encompasses what happens on

24

appeal and encompasses finality on appeal?

25

I mean, aren't you then admitting that

MR. LINDSTROM:

We don't think it does.

level.

5

between the two and wants them to be treated separately

6

so that if you get the IFP status in the district court,

7

that's one thing.

It

So the statute clearly draws a distinction

8

Getting IFP status in the Federal court is

9

another thing because what's going on here is Congress

10

is granting a subsidy to prisoners to allow them to

11

pursue further litigation, and Congress simply drew a

12

line in the statute saying, We'll subsidize a certain

13

number of these ­­ of IFP appeals and actions before we

14

cut it off.

15

There's other statutes that also show that

6

So this Court itself has stopped in forma

Then after that, there's a much

So I think that our reading is consistent

21

with what Congress is trying to do, which is to look at

22

the great bulk of the cases and say 95, 96, some high

23

percentage of cases, those are going to be cases where

24

the original strike was affirmed, and so it's a very

25

remote possibility.

If the language were completely

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MR. KEDEM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

If I could start with the issue of finality

15

and the normal background principles, the argument that

16

petitioner makes, and this is echoed by the argument

17

that he makes in pages 9 to 10 of his reply brief, is

18

that sometimes Congress specifies that finality is

19

required and sometimes it specifies that finality is not

20

required, and so we can draw no negative inference from

21

the fact that Congress was silent here.

22

But if you look at the example of the

23

statute in which Congress specified non­finality that he

24

gives, it's actually not a statute at all.

25

Federal rule of evidence.

It's a

Moreover, petitioner

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

identifies no instance in which Congress has a statute

2

in which it is silent about whether or not you require

3

finality, like subsection G, and yet finality was

4

implicitly read to be required; in other words, no

5

instance in which a finality requirement was inferred

6

rather than expressed.

7

sometimes finality might be able to be inferred,

8

Section 1915 is an especially bad candidate, because it

9

distinguishes so repeatedly and so sharply between the

10

trial and appellate stages.
And that brings me to petitioner's single

12

occasion theory, articulated most clearly in pages 18 to

13

19 of his opening brief.

14

court dismissal plus the appeal from that dismissal

15

constitute a single ongoing occasion.

you could end up with overlapping occasions, not only

the trial court dismissal, but on appeal, also a

concedes, is an occasion in its own right.

that the very test you want to retake is a prior

MR. KEDEM:

It's not

Well, what usually happens is

21

what happened in this very case; namely, that the court

22

says, I'm not granting you IFP status and I'm going to

dismiss your case if you don't pay the filing fee.

so you could file Rule 60(b)(5) motion to have that

MR. KEDEM:

My understanding is that there's

a circuit split as to whether if you're denied IFP

10

status, you nevertheless are still on the hook for the

11

filing fee.

12
13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that would

really make your position complicated.

14

MR. KEDEM:

Your Honor, I think if you are a

15

prisoner who's three strikes barred and you still want

16

to file a fourth suit, there might be some consequence;

17

namely, that you might be on the hook if that third

18

strike is ultimately affirmed, as most third strikes

19

are.

20

I'd like to address also the point that

21

Petitioner makes that his position is much more easily

22

administered.

23

basically the same on either approach.

24

if you only know that the prisoner is three strikes

25

barred, then you can rely on that under Petitioner's

Because I actually think the inquiry is

approach.
But that's not normally what happens.

What

3

normally happens is what happened in this very case.

4

Namely, the trial court lists the prior dismissals, plus

5

what it knows about what happened to those dismissals on

6

appeal, and it makes an IFP determination.

7

And under either approach, the inquiry is as

8

follows:

9

dismissal that was affirmed on appeal, you can always

For any appellate dismissal or a trial court

10

rely on that going forward.

11

dismissal where you don't know what happened on appeal,

12

you simply have to check the appellate docket, something

13

that, as Petitioner points out, courts are already very

14

familiar with.

15

the inquiry is entirely the same.

16

And for any trial court

So under either approach, essentially

And finally, Your Honor, if you are simply

17

not convinced by the textual arguments and you just want

18

to know what makes practical sense, you should go with

19

the approach that works in the vast majority of cases.

20

And in the vast majority of cases, what happens is what

21

happened in this very case.

22

that was ultimately affirmed on appeal.

Justice Kennedy asked Mr. Lindstrom whether

4

the inconsistency between Respondent's position and the

Federal government's position undercuts the whole

6

argument here, and we would respectfully submit that it

7

does.

Let me start with Respondent's interpretation.

8

I don't think that I could put the problem

9

with that interpretation better than the Federal

10

government itself does in its brief where it suggests

11

that "an interpretation, which precludes even an appeal

12

from the very dismissal that counts as a third strike,

13

would be inconsistent with quote,

14

which a litigant is permitted an appeal as of right,

One would expect Congress to have spoken

18

while in Section 1915(a)(3), Congress specified certain

circumstances under which an IFP appeal is not

20

permitted, it conspicuously did not bar IFP appeals from

21

Now, Respondents attempt to mitigate the

21

principles.

22

for the simple reason that you simply cannot get this

23

different suit distinction out of the phrase "prior

24

occasion."

25

Breyer highlighted in his colloquy with Mr. Kedem, that

I

He instead started with background

And that is, I would respectfully submit,

It would lead to the odd result, as Justice

50
Alderson Reporting Company

1

a prior dismissal could count as a prior occasion in

2

some circumstances, but not in others.

3

Let me address the question of background

4

principles because that was such the focus of Mr.

5

Kedem's argument.

6

principles differ in the law whether as a matter of

7

statute or whether as a matter of background principles.

8

Congress can be explicit in both directions and,

9

obviously, here Congress was silent.

We would respectfully submit that

I think in terms

10

of nonstatutory background principles, frankly, the

11

primary principle on which the Federal government relies

12

in its brief is the principle of claim preclusion.

13

it is certainly true that in some jurisdictions,

14

consequences attach immediately upon judgment.

15

not the rule in others.

16

consequences don't attach until the judgment becomes

17

final on appeal.

18

And

That's

In California and Texas,

But that doctrine serves a quite different

immediately is precisely to ensure that a losing party

consequences in other lawsuits, however unrelated and

At bottom, recognizing that there is some

6

ambiguity here, given the fact that you have three

parties here who are offering different interpretations,

8

none of which lines up with the interpretation of the
