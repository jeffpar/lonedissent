United States.

Mr. O'Connor.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHANNON P. O'CONNOR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. O'CONNOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The big issue that starts in this case is

12

whether, after completing the task related to a traffic

13

stop, whether an officer without individualized

14

suspicion can hold the driver for a dog sniff.

15

specific question in this case is whether Officer

16

Struble was entitled to piggyback an already completed

17

traffic offense with probable cause on to that piggyback

18

­­ on to that traffic offense for an investigation of

19

Mr. Rodriguez involving nothing more than a hunch.

20

is the question of the case.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

That

But that remains ­­ that

22

wasn't reached by the court of appeals.

23

the district court, as you pointed out, rejected the

24

argument that there was probable cause saying if nothing

25

more than a hunch.

The district ­­

But that was not reviewed by the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

court of appeals.

2

So that would still be open.

MR. O'CONNOR:

The ­­ the decision of the

3

court of appeals, Your Honor, absolutely, that was a de

4

minimis ruling.

5

whether there was reasonable suspicion, and left it just

6

based on their ruling of ­­ of whether, in fact, this

7

was a de minimis action.

8
9

They did not reach the question as to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, do you

concede that this would be all right if the dog sniff

10

took place during the traffic stop?

let's say, there were, you know, two ­­ two policemen

there already.

14

policeman walks around with the dog.

15

that?

16

In other words,

One says, I'm going to go write you a

MR. O'CONNOR:

No problem with

There'd be no problem,

17

Mr. Chief Justice, if ­­ if, in fact, all of that was

18

done before the traffic ticket was written.

19

fact, the dog was written ­­ taken around the car prior

20

to the completion of the traffic stop and the ticket,

21

then, of course, it would be ­­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If, in

All right.
Mr. O'Connor ­­

24

Mr. O'Connor, it's frequent that a policeman, when he

25

stops somebody for a broken taillight or whatever, will

4
Alderson Reporting Company

1

conduct some other inquiries, you know, where are you

2

going?

3

check whether the person is ­­ is driving a stolen car,

4

whether ­­ whether the person is properly licensed.

5

of that has nothing to do with the broken taillight and

6

yet, that's permitted, right?

Ask a lot of questions.

7

MR. O'CONNOR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. O'CONNOR:

Would it be permitted if he

He ­­ he

can only do that before he writes the ticket.

going to give you a ticket, but I just want to ask you a

few questions.

those questions are impermissible because he's made his

22

decision, he's not going to give a ticket.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In

It seems to me that under your argument,

On the other hand, as Justice Alito

24

indicated, suppose that he said, now, I finished your

ticket, but before I give it to you, I'm going to go

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

hypotheticals that have a wrong presumption, okay?

17

There are certain tasks involved in giving a traffic

18

ticket, correct?

19

MR. O'CONNOR:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

And those include

21

checking for warrants, checking for tickets on the car,

22

checking identity, asking questions about that, and

23

generally with identity it also has to do with where are

24

you going and where are you coming from.

MR. O'CONNOR:

MR. O'CONNOR:

It has to be the

Yes, Your Honor, that is

exactly right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, but you've tied it

13

to just writing it ­­ handing over the ticket, but ­­ or

14

you're not even doing that, you're ­­ you're saying just

15

writing the ticket, which is crazy.

16

MR. O'CONNOR:

If, in fact, that's ­­ that's

17

the impression that I gave, that ­­ that is wrong.

18

not ­­ the formal handing of the ticket is when the stop

19

is complete.

20

the purpose is complete, the ticket is done, whether it

21

is a warning, whether it is handed to them, at some

22

point in time the ticket is done and that's the

23

investigation of the stop.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

It's

Once the justification for the stop and

Justice Sotomayor's

question assumes, and you apparently embrace the

8

Official

1

assumption, that checking on whether you have a

2

private ­­ a proper license, checking whether the car is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Part of the mission where

you stop somebody is not just the broken taillight, but,

drugs on the car, so let's bring in a dog and do the car

everything up to but not beyond the dog sniff.

you do that?

to the question of why can't we include the dog sniff.

You're not arguing that, and that leaves us open

7

MR. O'CONNOR:

Don't tie

As a policy question, if you

could end it with the handing of the ticket, that would

be acceptable.

If we tie ­­ if we tie the traffic

the stop, then we ­­

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we hold that it's okay to

have a dog sniff so long as it's before the ticket is

issued, then every police officer other than those who

are uninformed or incompetent will delay the handing

this ­­ is this very ­­ the easiest thing to get around

Well, then the police can

just say, I'm going to defer that a few minutes until

the dog sniff occurs.

Basically what you do is the officer sees
the infraction; the officer pulls the person over; the

Alderson Reporting Company

officer tells the person what the infraction is; he does

2

the license; he does the registration, runs the car.

3

Then when it's done, he gives him the ticket, the

warning ticket.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You say he "runs the car."

MR. O'CONNOR:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14
15

Yes, Your Honor.
Why is that part of the

mission and the dog sniff is not?

That's the question.

If you're not going to have a formal rule,

16

you have to explain why ­­ somebody's pulled over for a

17

broken taillight, why the ­­ adding any time to the stop

18

in order to do a records check is part of the mission

19

but the dog sniff is not.

20

I mean, I could understand the rule, you

21

pull somebody over for a broken taillight, maybe you get

22

the registration to make sure you write out the ticket

23

to the right person.

24

that's it.

25

Then you give him the ticket, and

so that the officer is doing nothing but that dog sniff,

the question would be whether that 11­minute total stop

is reasonable.

So, again, I think the only interest at stake from the

practically officers often end up or need to do the dog

sniff after the tickets.

12

So the hypothetical that I propose is that

if you imagine you have two officers conducting a stop

and the first officer is explaining the ticket and

15

what's happening with the ticket to the person, to the

driver.

17

performing the dog sniff around the car.

18

who's explaining the ticket ends first and the dog sniff

takes another 30 seconds, I don't think there's any

reason to say that that stop, which maybe lasted a total

of ten minutes has ­­ has gone on for longer than

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You know, I ­­ I think I

8

read Caballes differently than you.

Here's what I think

9

Caballas agrees with you on and here's what I think

10

Caballes doesn't.

Caballes definitely agrees with you on

11

that a dog sniff is not part of the traffic stop.

12

think that you and Caballes are definitely in the same

13

place there.

14

though a dog sniff is not part of the mission of the

15

traffic stop, we're going to allow a dog sniff if the dog

16

sniff doesn't extend the traffic stop.

17

know, there are two officers or there's some other reason

18

why you're not being detained a moment longer because of

19

the dog sniff and Caballes basically says, sure, no harm,

20

no foul on that one, right?

So I

And Caballes definitely says that even

It's like, you

21

But then you're saying Caballes gives you

22

this extra leeway to detain people even though it is

23

longer than an ordinary traffic stop would take, and I

24

think that's just not right.

25

reasonableness language in Caballes is all about ­­ it's

I mean, I think that

41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

an extra limitation the Court says.

2

don't think just because this officer was really slow

3

and it took a really long time to do the traffic stop,

4

and he was able because of that to get another officer

5

in and do a dog sniff and it was all with ­­ it's like

6

an additional limitation that, no, you have to be

7

diligent and you have to be reasonable in the way you

conduct the traffic stop.

11

that's an additional constraint.

12

extra leeway for the police officers to do things

13

outside the bounds of the traffic stop itself.

14

MS. ANDERS:

But it ­­ that's ­­

It's not some kind of

Well, I think that's one way to

15

read Caballes's language.

16

that that's the right way is that we know after Caballes

17

that a dog sniff is not an independent Fourth Amendment

18

intrusion.

19

doesn't impose ­­ it doesn't violate any independent

20

scope limitation on traffic stops.

21

The reason we don't think

It's not a search.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We also know that it

It is not a search, but

22

the ­­ but the theory of Caballes and of all of our

23

questions is that you can't ­­ and of all of our

24

cases ­­ is that you really can't detain somebody if you

25

don't have some kind of objective reasonable basis for

42
Alderson Reporting Company

1

doing so.

2

might be ten minutes or it might be five minutes or it

3

might be two minutes ­­ without that kind of basis is a

4

Fourth Amendment violation.

5

And that any detention ­­ and, you know, it

MS. ANDERS:

But once the individual is

6

already being detained for a traffic stop on probable

7

cause, I think the implication of Caballes is that ­­

that if the dog sniff takes any time, then the intrusion

9

we're talking about is the incremental delay.

It's a

temporal intrusion.

perspective, her interest in ­­ it's the same in

Alderson Reporting Company

1

one of the things that courts should look to is the

2

relative proportion of time of the dog sniff to the rest

3

of the stop.

4

relevant is that the officer ­­ this is the case in

5

routine traffic stops as well ­­ the officer has to be

6

reasonably diligent.

7

diligent can take into account whether the officer is

8

predominantly working on resolving the traffic

9

violation.

And I ­­ the reason I think that is

And so, I think reasonably

But if he is able to a dog sniff within a

10

reasonable amount of time and not have the traffic stop

11

12

stop, then he ought to be able to do that.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that – is that

almost always the case, that the dog sniff is going to

take longer than the traffic stop?

so.

saying that ­­ that, again, this is subject to a

15

reasonableness analysis, that the officer can do the dog

16

sniff and he can prolong the stop either before or after

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I was saying two parts.

19

Part one, traffic stoppers, you can use a dog sniff when

20

you stop, but not once the stop is over, period, unless

21

you have cause or something.

22

that's part two, you can't prolong it but for a reason.

23

You have to do it all within a reasonable time, okay?

24

You can't unreasonably prolong it to get your dog in.

25

See?

And during the stop,

You tell them those two things.

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Once you've told

Official

1

them the two things, they've got it in their heads.

2

When this is over, good­bye dog.

3

MS. ANDERS:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well,

so that ­­

When it's not over, they

5

better be careful not to unreasonably prolong it.

6

they'll understand that, and it will be both protecting

7

what the Fourth Amendment protects and also, I think,

8

giving them enough leeway to conduct a traffic stop.

9

MS. ANDERS:

Now,

Well, so that makes the

10

officer's sequencing decision entirely dispositive of

11

whether the dog sniff can occur.

12

the stop, then it's fine; and after the stop, not.

13

think that does create arbitrary results from the

14

perspective of the intrusion on the individual.

15

from the officer's perspective, I think there's an

16

interest in officers having some leeway to sequence the

17

traffic stop.

But what your ­­ where your

24

rule is going to lead to, Ms. Anders, is something along

25

the lines of, like, everybody will decide 30 minutes or

40 minutes, I think you say at one point in your brief,

2

is reasonable for a traffic stop.

3

taillight violation, that's 40 minutes of free time for

4

the police officers to investigate any crimes that they

5

want, because they can do it all in the range of what

6

you've decided is kind of the reasonable traffic stop.

7

MS. ANDERS:

And if you see a

I don't think that's how we

8

envision the analysis going, because the ultimate length

9

of time has to be within the duration of a routine

10

traffic stop that doesn't involve a dog sniff.

11

that's going to vary based on the circumstances because

12

routine traffic stops, what's reasonable varies based on

13

the circumstances.

14

they can look at what the officer actually did and they

15

can look to stops involving similar circumstances but

16

not dog sniffs, and determine whether the officer was

17

able to do the whole thing within a reasonable amount of

18

time.

19

And

So what we think courts can do is

I think that's essentially what the Court

20

contemplated in Ornelas, that with these Fourth

21

Amendment inquiries they're fact­specific, but, you

22

know, the harder cases will be appealed and ­­ and there

23

will start being guidelines, the courts can look to

24

similar indications.

25

We think the same thing can happen here, and

52
Alderson Reporting Company

1

indeed it already has happened with respect to unrelated

2

questioning.

3

appeals have said that you can extend a traffic stop for

4

unrelated questioning, and the courts have looked to how

5

much time does the questioning take, how long is the

6

overall stop, and was the officer reasonably diligent

7

with respect to the traffic mission.

There, the vast majority of the courts of

That's the only rule that avoids arbitrary

4

what they'll do is tend to prolong the stops, and

5

they'll want to be sure the dogs get there.

Gee, I

And so if you really added all this up

7

and thought about it, even experimentally, the class of

8

stopped drivers where there are hunches is going to end

9

up waiting longer and being in custody, in a sense,

10
